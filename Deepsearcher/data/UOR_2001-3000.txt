TI Effects of Addition of Tea Polyphenol Palmitate and Process Parameters
   on the Preparation of High-Purity EPA Ethyl Ester
SO FOODS
AB High-purity eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester (EPA-EE) can be produced from an integrated technique consisting of saponification, ethyl esterification, urea complexation, molecular distillation and column separation. In order to improve the purity and inhibit oxidation, tea polyphenol palmitate (TPP) was added before the procedure of ethyl esterification. Furthermore, through the optimization of process parameters, 2:1 (mass ratio of urea to fish oil, g/g), 6 h (crystallization time) and 4:1 (mass ratio of ethyl alcohol to urea, g/g) were found to be the optimum conditions in the procedure of urea complexation. Distillate (fraction collection), 115 degrees C (distillation temperature) and one stage (the number of stages) were found to be the optimum conditions for the procedure of molecular distillation. With the addition of TPP and the above optimum conditions, high-purity (96.95%) EPA-EE was finally obtained after column separation.

TI Defects engineering and interface regulation on nickel-rich sulphides
   promoting water/urea/ethanol electrooxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Design and fabrication of high-efficiency nickel-rich electrocatalytic materials for sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a tremendous challenge. Modulating internal electronic state and accelerating charge transfer are two of vital means to optimizing electrocatalysts. In this work, nanoparticles-rich Fe-(CeS2/Ni3S2) hybrid material with abundant heterointerfaces and sulfur-defects are facilely synthesized. The strategy of iron dopant is conducive to induce more sulfur defects. The cerium species can modulate the internal electronic state and stabilize some of the surface sulphide against self-oxidation during OER process. This self-supported heterogeneous material requires overpotentials of 254 and 372 mV to reach the current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm-2 in alkaline condition. The addition of urea or ethanol to the bath solution has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy for reducing the onset potential and decreasing energy consumption, thereby confirming the feasibility of applying this approach to energy-saving hydrogen production through electrolysis wastewater splitting.

TI Facile Construction of Ultrathin V-Doped
   NiSe2/Ni3Se4/CuSe Nanosheets for
   Enhanced Urea-Assisted Electrochemical Hydrogen Production
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB Hydrogen production by electrolytic water is a green technology, which is conducive to alleviating the current severe energy and environmental crisis. However, it is affected by the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential and has high energy consumption. Replacing the OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can reduce energy consumption. Herein, V-doped bimetallic selenides with an ultrathin nanosheet structure catalyst (V-NiSe2/Ni(3)Se4/CuSe/NF) are prepared via hydrothermal and low-temperature selenization. The catalyst has excellent UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33 V at 100 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability (120 h at 10 mA cm(-2)). Electrochemical measurements and characterization indicate that the abundant interface formed by NiSe2/Ni3Se4 and CuSe can induce charge transfer, thereby improving the catalytic activity and stability of the electrode material. V doping promotes the formation of ultrathin nanosheets with folds, which favors expanding the catalyst's active site and the contact region between the catalyst and the electrolyte, thus improving the catalytic activity. In situ Raman measurement further proves that V doping is beneficial to the surface reconstruction of the catalyst and accelerates the reaction kinetics of UOR. This work offers a new idea for the preparation of highly active UOR electrodes.

TI Efficient urea synthesis via one-step N-C-N coupling: strong
   metal-support interaction-driven planar Cu clusters on two-dimensional
   Mo2C MXene
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The electrocatalytic co-reduction of small carbonaceous and nitrogenous molecules recently emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate carbon emissions, facilitate wastewater denitrification, and sustain urea synthesis. However, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts to accelerate C-N coupling and multiple protonation steps remains challenging. Herein, inspired by the "strong metal-support interaction" (SMSI) concept, we designed novel catalysts, comprised of size-selected Cu clusters anchored on the two-dimensional molybdenum carbide MXene (Cu-n/Mo2C), for urea production via the co-reduction of nitrate (NO3-) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Our density functional theory (DFT) computations revealed that these Cu clusters are strongly immobilized on the Mo2C substrate by forming planar structures, leading to considerable active sites. Notably, these Cu-n/Mo2C catalysts demonstrate enhanced activity for urea synthesis through a one-step N-C-N coupling mechanism. This process involves the insertion of CO* into the NH2* - NH2* intermediate, facilitated by electrostatic attractions between their nitrogen atoms. In particular, among the catalysts tested, Cu-4/Mo2C exhibits superior performance, achieving urea production with a limiting potential of -0.36 V. Furthermore, the competing side reactions, such as CO reduction or release, NH3 production, hydrogen evolution, and surface oxidation, are significantly suppressed, ensuring its high selectivity for urea synthesis. This work not only introduces a novel method for urea electro-synthesis via SMSI between metal clusters and substrate, but also suggests a strategy for synthesizing other organonitrogen compounds.

TI Regulating the pyrolysis process of cation intercalated MnO2
   nanomaterials for electrocatalytic urea oxidation performance
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Exploring an efficient way to enhance electron/ion transport behavior of nanomaterials plays an important role in the study of energy storage & conversion. However, the evolution rules of lattice and electronic structure during the pyrolysis process of low-dimensional nanomaterials, which further regulate its electron/ion transport properties, have not been effectively elucidated. Here we study the pyrolysis process of cation intercalated MnO2 as a case for realizing optimized electron/ion transport behavior. In our case, thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) was adopted for tracking the remaining products in pyrolysis and decomposition products, further finding out the evolution law of the manganese-oxygen polyhedron structure during the pyrolysis. Moreover, the internal relations between the crystal structure and the electronic structure during the pyrolysis process of low-dimensional manganese oxide are revealed by fine structure characterization. As expected, partially treated 2D MnO2 nanosheets with controlled pyrolysis displays ultrahigh UOR performance with the overpotential of 1.320 V vs. RHE at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is the best value among non-nickel-based materials. We anticipate that studying the mechanism of the pyrolysis process has important guiding significance for the development of high electron/ion transport devices.

TI Microwave-Assisted Tandem Kornblum Oxidation and Biginelli Reaction for
   the Synthesis of Dihydropyrimidones
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB A simple and straightforward approach for the synthesis of dihydropyrimidones via sequential Kornblum oxidation/Biginelli reaction has been developed. The protocol involves an in situ oxidation of benzyl halides which serve as a carbonyl equivalents followed by cyclocondensation with (thio) urea and ethylacetoacetate to furnish dihydropyrimidones under catalyst and base free conditions in a one-pot tandem manner under microwave irradiation. Further, the product purification using aqueous recrystallization avoids large quantities of volatile and a toxic organic solvent usually required for work-up and very less time required for this process makes the method environmental- and nature-friendly.

TI 2.2 V wearable asymmetric supercapacitors based on Co oxide//Mn oxide
   electrodes and a PVA-KOH-urea-LiClO4 alkaline gel electrolyte
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In this study, redox-active polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-KOH-urea-LiClO4 alkaline gel electrolyte was prepared and used to assemble a Co oxide//Mn oxide wearable asymmetric supercapacitor (WASC). This experiment was achieved by choosing a deep eutectic solvent, urea-LiClO4, as the redox additive and aid a broad operating voltage, alongside an alkaline KOH-PVA gel to enhance redox performance and as plasticizer. The nanoporous Co oxide and Mn oxide electrodes were prepared using electroplating. The Co oxide//Mn oxide WASC with a PVA-KOH-urea-LiClO4 gel electrolyte can operate with an output voltage of 2.2 V and produce a high energy density of 125 Wh/kg at 2200 W/kg. The WASC showed good performance (186 F/g at 2 A/g) and 89.5% capacitance retention after 6000 charging/discharging cycles. Additionally, the WASC can maintain its electrochemical performance at various bending angles. Studied as the WASC electrode, in-situ/ operando X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy revealed that the Co oxide suffers a reversible oxidation state-alteration reaction related to the redox pseudocapacitance reaction in PVA-KOH-urea-LiClO4. To show real life application, the WASCs were successfully applied to power a light-emitting diode and a digital watch.

TI An efficient one-pot synthesis of industrially valuable primary organic
   carbamates and N-substituted ureas by a reusable Merrifield
   anchored iron(ii)-anthra catalyst [Fe<SUP>II</SUP>(Anthra-Merf)] using
   urea as a sustainable carbonylation source
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB An efficient synthesis of primary carbamates and N-substituted ureas is explored with a newly developed heterogeneous polymer supported iron catalyst in the presence of a sustainable carbonylation source. The Merrifield anchored iron(ii)-anthra catalyst [Fe-II(Anthra-Merf)] was synthesized by functionalization of Merrifield polymer followed by grafting of iron metal. The catalyst [Fe-II(Anthra-Merf)] was characterized by several techniques, like SEM, EDAX, TGA, PXRD, XPS, FTIR, CHN, AAS and UV-Vis analysis. The designed polymer embedded [Fe-II(Anthra-Merf)] complex is a remarkably successful catalyst for the synthesis of primary organic carbamates and N-substituted ureas by using safe carbonylation agent urea with different derivatives of alcohols and amines, respectively. The reported catalyst is a potential candidate towards contributing a satisfactory yield of isolated products under suitable reaction conditions. The catalyst is recyclable and almost non-leaching in nature after six runs with an insignificant drop in catalytic activity. Thus we found an economical and viable catalyst [Fe-II(Anthra-Merf)] for primary carbamates and N-substituted urea synthesis under moderate reaction conditions.

TI A eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea as an assisting solvent
   in the synthesis of flower-like hierarchical BiOCl structures with
   enhanced photocatalytic activity
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Flower-like hierarchical BiOCl structures were successfully synthesized in the presence of a eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea through a solvothermal process. The as-prepared sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis, photo-electrochemical analysis and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). During the reaction process, the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea acted not only as the solvent and the template, but also as a chlorine source for the fabrication of flower-like BiOCl. In addition, the photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of RhB in aqueous solution was also investigated. The results showed that the flower-like BiOCl exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB under sunlight illumination. Meanwhile, the flower-like BiOCl catalyst performed without obvious decrease in activity after five cycles. Furthermore, the main reactive species in the catalytic oxidation reaction were detected through radical trapping experiments.

TI Preparation of Ni nanotube-modified electrodes via galvanic displacement
   on sacrificial Zn templates: Solvent effects and attempts for
   non-enzymatic electrochemical detection of urea
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB In this study, Ni nanotube-modified stainless-steel electrode (SSE\Ni-anodized) was prepared by galvanic displacement on tangled Zn nanowire-composed sacrificial template (SSE\Zn) followed by anodization in 1 M NaOH. The tangled Zn nanowires were electrodeposited from an amide-type room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) 1-butyl-1-methypyrrolidinium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide ([BMP][TFSA]) containing ZnCl2, and then galvanic displacement was conducted in the same RTIL with [NiCl4](2-). The process was unable to be reproduced by using water or choline chloride-ethylene glycol deep eutectic solvent (ChCI-EG DES) as the reaction media, indicating the unique properties of RTILs. The cations of RTILs are critical to successfully retaining the skeleton of Zn-nanowire-template. SSE\Ni-anodized showed high activity towards the oxidation of urea and possessed a detection limit of 3 mu M, a sensitivity of 902.8 mu A.mM(-1).cm(- 2), and a dynamic range of 1-20000 mu M. Most importantly, the electrode could be regenerated by anodization in 1 M NaOH to remove adsorbed urea without significantly altering the surface morphology and performance of the electrode. A low background current was achieved after the regeneration process, which is important for repeatedly using the same electrode in urea determination.

TI Highly active and stable catalysts for Baeyer-Villiger
   oxidation-Traditional postloading vs in situ synthesis of Fe/N/C
   nanoparticles
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Nitrogen-doped carbon composites are prepared using simple precursors, such as glucose or urea and used as supports for Fe nanoparticles. The present work investigated two approaches for incorporating metal nanoparticles into the composite: traditional metal postloading and in situ formation of a metal/N-doped carbon catalyst. The impacts of the preparation technique on (i) the characteristics of the resulting iron oxides (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) and (ii) the nanoparticle distribution on the support were determined. Microscopic surface characterization revealed that the postloading method promoted a uniform distribution of Fe nanoparticles (5-10 nm), which enhanced the activity and long-term stability of the catalytic system for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of cyclic ketones. The product yield reached 97% (5 h, 60 degrees C), and after the third reaction cycle, the yield remained at 96%. The proposed synthetic approach for preparing active and stable catalysts provides a new perspective for the inexpensive and sustainable synthesis of lactones.

TI Soil anammox community structure in different land use soils treatment
   with <SUP>13</SUP>C urea as determined by analysis of phospholipid fatty
   acids
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process is globally an important nitrogen-cycling process mediated by specialized microbes. However, still little information is documented about anammox microbial community structure under agricultural soils. The anaerobic incubation experiment was conducted to study the impacts of different land use soils fertilized by C-13-urea on the activity and diversity of anammox bacteria using stable isotope to probe the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA-SIP). The C-13 was preferentially incorporated in ratios PLFAs 16:1 omega 7c, 16:1 omega 5c, and 16:0. The results revealed that the abundance of the anammox bacteria (both hzs-beta and hzo) were observed in vegetable soil V1 and paddy soils (R1 and R2) means that they were positively correlated with C-13-urea but were negatively correlated with NO3 (-)-N and NH4 (+)-N concentrations. Thus, C-13-PLFAs 16:1 omega 7c, 16:1 omega 5c, and 16:0 could be the biomarker as soil anammox. The anaerobic microbial community composition of soils under different land use systems was diverse, and V1, R1, and R2 had similar microbial diversity and higher microbial biomass. The principal component analysis between soil properties and gene abundance suggested that not only pH but also soil organic matter, available P, and available K were important factors for the anammox process. This study suggested that C-13-Urea-PLFA for anaerobic incubation was a simple method to study anammox microbial community structure through affecting the soil nutrients, and the different land use systems played important roles in determining the microbial composition of soils.

TI Decentralized electro-sanitation system as proof of concept to treat
   urine produced in long-distance bus
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB Long-distance transportation provides in-vehicle access to essential sanitation to the passengers. However, generated yellow and black waters may not be correctly managed prior sanitary effluent discharge. Processes that can handle decentralized effluent treatment can be considered alternatives to traditional chemical treatment systems. In this study, decentralized electrochemically-driven treatment is presented as a proof of concept. A compact electrochemical reactor design considering the boundary conditions and requirements for decentralized sanitary treatment for long-distance bus transportation has been accomplished. Treatment of synthetic urine effluents was conducted under filter-press reactor with continuous flow in a closed upward recirculation reactor containing a carbon felt (CF) cathode and a dimensionally stable anode (DSA: Ti/Ru0.36Ti0.64O2). The experimental design allowed the assessment of operational variable impacts on reduction of urea concentration, and consequent estimate of the total organic carbon abatement. The results revealed that synthetic urine solution diluted from toilet water flushing (TOC = 402 mg L-1) can be effectively treated under application of low current densities of 18 mA cm-2 in 300 min (average time of on-road service). Real-time monitoring of parameters revealed a decrease in pH from 6.98 to 3.49, and a gradual increase in temperature from 25.3 degrees C to 32.0 degrees C at the end of the process. Those physico-chemical changes can be useful to inhibit urea hydrolysis. Thus, the results encourage the application of electrochemical technology in decentralized effluent treatment systems to enhance and enable ecologically correct sanitation actions in portable urinary collectors, such as those used in bus road transport.

TI Visualizing small-scale subsurface NH3 and pH dynamics
   surrounding nitrogen fertilizer granules and impacts on nitrification
   activity
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB In agricultural soils, nitrogen (N) fertilizer is typically applied as ammonium salts or urea, and undergoes microbially mediated oxidation. However, insights regarding substrate concentrations nitrifiers are exposed to in the zones immediately surrounding N fertilizer granules remain unexamined, as well as how this affects the activity or inhibition of nitrifier groups adapted to different ranges of ammonia (NH3) concentrations. To examine millimeter scale changes in soil chemistry after sub-surface fertilizer granule application with high spatiotemporal resolution, we applied a newly developed NH3 and pH planar optical sensor (optode) system. With this system, we visualized in situ subsurface NH3 production, diffusion, and associated pH shifts in an agricultural soil following the application (from 5 min up to 65.5 h) of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) or urea granules in a laboratory study. Ammonia from both NH4Cl and urea granules diffused up to 1.5 and 2 cm and reached maximum concentrations of >49 and >130 ppm(v), respectively. Spatially informed destructive subsampling (0.5-2 cm from granules) revealed that nitrate accumulation was greatest closest (0.5-1 cm) to the ammonium chloride granules, while nitrite was not detected. In contrast, urea application resulted in both nitrite and nitrate accumulation, with the highest concentrations detected furthest (1.5-2 cm) from urea granules. Urea hydrolysis also caused a significant localized pH increase, while ammonium chloride caused a circular elevated pH zone migrating outwards leaving a decreased pH at the center. Transcription of the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial amoA gene was highest in areas furthest (1.5-2 cm) from the urea granules, while there were no significant differences in amoA transcription with increasing distance from the NH4Cl granules. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and comammox amoA transcripts were not detected. This study is the first to directly visualize small-scale subsurface changes in NH3 concentration and pH after fertilizer granule application and relate these to nitrification activity.

TI Nickel encapsulated in carbon-dot-derived nanosheets for efficient
   hydrogen evolution via urea-assisted water electrolysis
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through the urea-assisted electrolysis of water possesses considerable potential to reduce the consumption of energy during hydrogen generation. As a more favorable active site for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), Ni has the merits of high intrinsic activity, excellent conductivity, and low price. However, achieving the desired activity and stability for single metal Ni remains a great challenge. Selecting appropriate substrates to maximize the activity of Ni while also maintaining its stability may be a feasible strategy. Herein, using N-doped carbon dots (NCDs) as a participant, a hydrophilic electrocatalyst with Ni nanoparticles wrapped in a carbon-dot-derived coating (Ni@NCDs) was fabricated. Benefiting from the encapsulated structure and their benign hydrophilicity, the Ni@NCDs showed an excellent bifunctional catalytic activity for the HER and the UOR. Specifically, an overpotential of only 86 mV is needed to sustain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER in alkaline media and a potential as low as 1.38 V at 10 mA cm(-2) is required for the UOR. Furthermore, the coupled HER and UOR system requires a low cell voltage of only 1.47 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with outstanding long-term durability, which is much lower than that for standard water electrolysis. This study is expected to provide new opportunities for the application of carbon dots in electrocatalysis.

TI Enzymatically functionalized polyaniline thin films produced with
   one-step electrochemical immobilization and its application in glucose
   and urea potentiometric biosensors
SO BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES
AB Glucose and urea enzymatic biosensors were fabricated. One-step electrochemical immobilization process was used to produce thin polyaniline films with entrapped enzymes. Chronopotentiometric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and optical reflectance spectroscopy were used to determine the structure-property relationship of the functionalized polymeric thin films. The device has a recognition stage connected to a potentiometric field-effect-transistor stage and is based on the measurement of microenvironment pH variation or locally produced ions. Optimization of biosensor fabrication and effective measurement conditions were performed. The optimized films presented sensitivity, linearity and detection range to glucose of 14.6 +/- 0.4 mV/decade, 99.8% and from 10(-4) M to 10(-1) mol/L. Two different biosensors were produced based on the enzymatic reaction of urea with selectivity to ammonium or hydroxyl ions. For ammonium ion selective film, the sensor's parameters were 14.7 +/- 0.9 mV/decade, 98.2% and from 10(-5) to 10(-1) mol/L. For the hydroxyl ion selective film, the same parameters were 7.4 +/- 0.5 mV/decade, 98.1% and from 10(-5) to 10(-1) mol/L. The change in the oxidation state of the polymeric matrix explains: i) the large loss of functionality of glucose biosensor in time, ii) the conservation of functionality to the hydroxyl ions for urea biosensor and iii) the selectivity variation of the ammonium ion selective urea biosensor. The results indicate that the polymeric matrix has indeed changeable selectivity, what can be applied in different situations for biosensors production.

TI Graphitic N-Rich Graphene for Nonradical Peroxymonosulfate Activation
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-doped graphene has been regarded as one of the most promising materials for nonradical peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. However, facile construction of nitrogen-doped graphene and systematic investigation of its nonradical PMS activation in a practical environment still far lag behind. Herein, graphitic N-rich graphene was prepared by one-step pyrolysis of urea. The obtained urea-derived graphitic N-rich graphene (UGNG) possessed a high N content of 12.12 at. % and a graphitic N proportion of 41.12%, giving a high graphitic N content of 4.98 at. %. We confirmed that PMS donated electrons to the graphitic N in UGNG, resulting in the cleavage of PMS to singlet oxygen for nonradical oxidation. The turnover frequency for the oxidation reached the highest value of 10.5 min(-1). Also, the reaction could be conducted in a wide temperature (5-45 degrees C) range, even with the existence of common matrix species and different natural water matrixes. This work presented the direct conversion of N-rich organic urea to UGNG and systematically investigated its nonradical PMS activation, which is believed to be helpful to its further practical use.

TI New carbon nitride close to C6N7 with superior
   visible light absorption for highly efficient photocatalysis
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB The rational design and construction of novel two-dimensional (2D) carbon nitrides (CNs) beyond g-C3N4 is a hot topic in the fields of chemistry and materials. Inspired by the polymerisation of urea, we have prepared a series of novel C-C bridged heptazine CNs UOx (where x is the ratio of urea to oxamide, x = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3), which are similar to (C6N7)(n), upon the introduction of oxamide. As predicted using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the conjugated structure of UOx was effectively extended from an individual heptazine to the entire material. Consequently, its bandgap was reduced to 2.05 eV, and its absorption band edge was significantly extended to 600 nm. Furthermore, its carrier transfer and separation were significantly enhanced, establishing its superior photocatalytic activity. The optimised UO2 exhibits a superior photocatalytic hydrogen production rate about 108.59 lmol h(-1) (using 10 mg of catalyst) with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 36.12% and 0.33% at 420 and 600 nm, respectively, which is one of the most active novel CNs reported to date. Moreover, UO2 exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of diphenylhydrazine to azobenzene with conversion and selectivity reaching similar to 100%, which represents a promising highly efficient 2D CN material. Regarding phenols degradation, UO2 also displayed significantly higher activity and durability during the degradation of phenol when compared to traditional g-C3N4, highlighting its significant potential for application in energy, environment and photocatalytic organic reactions.

TI Kupffer cells modulate hepatic fatty acid oxidation during infection
   with PR8 influenza
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE
AB In response to infection, patients with inborn errors of metabolism may develop a functional deterioration termed metabolic decompensation. The biochemical hallmarks of this disruption of metabolic homeostasis are disease specific and may include acidosis, hyperammonemia or hypoglycemia. In a model system previously published by our group, we noted that during influenza infection, mice displayed a depression in hepatic mitochondrial enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that this normal adaptation may extend to other metabolic pathways, and as such, may impact various inborn errors of metabolism. Since the liver is a critical organ in inborn errors of metabolism, we carried out untargeted metabolomic profiling of livers using mass spectrometry in C57B1/6 mice infected with influenza to characterize metabolic adaptation. Pathway analysis of metabolomic data revealed reductions in CoA synthesis, and long chain fatty acyl CoA and camitine species. These metabolic adaptations coincided with a depression in hepatic long chain 3-oxidation mRNA and protein. To our surprise, the metabolic changes observed occurred in conjunction with a hepatic innate immune response, as demonstrated by transcriptional profiling and flow cytometry. By employing an immunomodulation strategy to deplete Kupffer cells, we were able to improve the expression of multiple genes involved in 3-oxidation. Based on these findings, we are the first to suggest that the role of the liver as an immunologic organ is central in the pathophysiology of hepatic metabolic decompensation in inborn errors of metabolism due to respiratory viral infection.

TI Peri-Decoration of a Tetraazaperylene with Urea Units: Chiral
   Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) and Their Optical and Chiroptical
   Properties
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) are a new class of fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on a tetraazaperylene core that is formally condensed with N-substituted urea units in the two opposite peri positions. Here, we report the synthesis of series of substituted OAPPDO derivatives with different N-substitution patterns (H, alkyl, benzyl) in the peri positions, including bay-chlorinated OAPPDOs. Starting from the latter, a series of bay-arylated OAPPDOs was synthesized by Suzuki cross coupling, which resulted in the formation of helically chiral OAPPDO derivatives. The electrochemical and photophysical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. The P and M enantiomers of a phenylated OAPPDO were separated by semipreparative HPLC and further analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies, the mechanism of the isomerization, the electronic excitation and the CD spectrum (TD-DFT) were computed and compared to the experimental data. The reversible 1e(-) oxidation of the OAPPDOs generates the corresponding radical cations, one of which was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. The reversible oxidation process was also systematically investigated by spectro-electrochemistry.

TI Controlled Synthesis of MoNi4 Ultrathin Nanosheet Arrays as
   an Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Urea-Assisted Hydrogen
   Production
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The utilization of water electrolysis as a technology for industrial hydrogen production is considered highly appealing. Currently, the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involves a four-electron transfer process, hampers the overall efficiency of water splitting. The coupling of urea electrocatalysis with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) holds significant promise in achieving energy-efficient hydrogen production. Here, we present a study showcasing the in situ synthesis of arrays consisting of ultrathin MoNi4 nanosheets on a Ni foam (NF) substrate (MoNi4/NF). The catalyst exhibits high bifunctional activity due to its excellent intrinsic activity, increased exposure of active sites, and favorable morphology and structure of the electrode material. Specifically, overpotentials as low as 146 mV and 1.42 V are sufficient to drive a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for the HER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. Moreover, the utilization of optimized MoNi4/NF as a dual-electrode catalyst enables the provision of a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for hybrid water splitting when operating at a cell voltage of 1.54 V. This study presents a novel concept for the advancement of effective and enduring bifunctional electrocatalysts capable of facilitating both the HER and the UOR.

SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
AB This study reports a novel co-deposited catalyst which covalently coupled composite of Pd@ GRNPs-GCN for methanol electro-oxidation was investigated. The prepared nanocomposite material was further characterized through FTIR, XRD, SEM, and EDX analysis. The results showed that the Pd@GRNPs-GCN has stronger interaction, active specific area & rich content of pyridine & pyrrole nitrogen species which promotes the dispersion of PdNPs on GRNPs-GCN to present superior catalytic efficiency towards MOR. Moreover, the electrochemical analysis of cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) & electro chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) proved that fabricated Pd@GRNPs-GCN electro catalyst showed significant catalytic activity, lesser oxidation potential & longevity for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol in alkali media. All these results revealed that the nanocomposite hybrid electro catalyst for feature endeavours in DMFCs (Direct methanol fuel cells) applications.

TI Nitrogen source influences the interactions of comammox bacteria with
   aerobic nitrifiers
SO MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB While the co-existence of comammox Nitrospira with canonical nitrifiers is well documented in diverse ecosystems, there is still a dearth of knowledge about the mechanisms underpinning their interactions. Understanding these interaction mechanisms is important as they may play a critical role in governing nitrogen biotransformation in natural and engineered ecosystems. In this study, we tested the ability of two environmentally relevant factors (nitrogen source and availability) to shape interactions between strict ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and comammox Nitrospira in continuous flow column reactors. The composition of inorganic nitrogen species in reactors fed either ammonia or urea was similar during the lowest input nitrogen concentration (1 mg-N/L), but higher concentrations (2 and 4 mg-N/L) promoted significant differences in nitrogen species composition and nitrifier abundances. The abundance and diversity of comammox Nitrospira were dependent on both nitrogen source and input concentrations as multiple comammox Nitrospira populations were preferentially enriched in the urea-fed system. In contrast, their abundance was reduced in response to higher nitrogen concentrations in the ammonia-fed system. The preferential enrichment of comammox Nitrospira in the urea-fed system could be associated with their ureolytic activity calibrated to their ammonia oxidation rates, thus minimizing ammonia accumulation, which may be partially inhibitory. However, an increased abundance of comammox Nitrospira was not associated with a reduced abundance of nitrite oxidizers in the urea-fed system while a negative correlation was found between them in the ammonia-fed system, the latter dynamic likely emerging from reduced availability of nitrite to strict nitrite oxidizers at low ammonia concentrations.IMPORTANCENitrification is an essential biological process in drinking water and wastewater treatment systems for treating nitrogen pollution. The discovery of comammox Nitrospira and their detection alongside canonical nitrifiers in these engineered ecosystems have made it necessary to understand the environmental conditions that regulate their abundance and activity relative to other better-studied nitrifiers. This study aimed to evaluate two important factors that could potentially influence the behavior of nitrifying bacteria and, therefore, impact nitrification processes. Column reactors fed with either ammonia or urea were systematically monitored to capture changes in nitrogen biotransformation and the nitrifying community as a function of influent nitrogen concentration, nitrogen source, and reactor depth. Our findings show that with increased ammonia availability, comammox Nitrospira decreased in abundance while nitrite oxidizers abundance increased. Yet, in systems with increasing urea availability, comammox Nitrospira abundance and diversity increased without an associated reduction in the abundance of canonical nitrifiers.

TI Multielectronic synergetic Hf-doped NiFe-LDH/NF for efficient
   bifunctional electrocatalytic OER/UOR
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The inefficient Ni/Fe ion utilization and poor electrical conductivity of nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) restricts to its development in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction/urea oxidation reaction (OER/UOR). Herein, self-supported Hf-doped NiFe-LDH nanosheet arrays were successfully prepared on nickel foam (Hf-NiFe-LDH/NF) via a one-step solvothermal approach for the first time, in which the introduced highvalent Hf4+ altered the structure of electrons and chemical environment of the atoms and promoted the production of more active sites, thus realizing the fast kinetics of electron transfer on the layer. Meanwhile, the doped metal Hf ions increased the electric conduction and recycling stability of the catalyst. Astoundingly, the overpotential of Hf-NiFe-LDH/NF is barely 258 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm- 2, which is 61 mV lower than that of NiFe-LDH/NF, as well as outstanding stability for over 90 h during the OER. Similarly, the potential is only 1.37 V at 100 mA cm-2 during the UOR, 118 mV less was than at OER. Notably, Hf-NiFe-LDH/NF electrocatalyst exceeds the most previously reported electrocatalysts in terms of performance. This study highlights the benefits of Hf doping strategy in electrocatalytic OER/UOR and presents a promising new type of catalyst for future research.

AB This research was focused on the production of polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrates from a farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by-product (i.e. belly muscle). The effect of different process variables (urea/fatty acids (FA) contents ratio, crystallisation time and temperature and stirring speed of the urea/FA mixture) on the lipid oxidation development during the urea complexation process was investigated. For this purpose, an experimental design (26 runs) following the response-surface methodology was developed. As a result, peroxide value and TOTOX index showed to be dependent on the crystallisation time and temperature and the urea/FA ratio, while no influence of the crystallisation stirring speed was detected on both indices; additionally, polyene index was affected by the urea/FA ratio and its interaction with the crystallisation time. An optimised desirability score near 1.0 was attained provided values of 2.8 degrees C, 3.05h and 3.57 were applied for crystallisation temperature, crystallisation time and urea/FA ratio, respectively.

TI Model-Based Two-Stage SCR Urea Injection Strategy for Diesel Engine to
   Meet Low NOX Emission Regulation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Diesel engine emission regulations are becoming stringent regarding nitrogen oxide (NOX) limits. The challenge is to improve the NOX conversion efficiency of the after treatment system under low temperatures. Although the two-stage selective catalytic reduction (SCR) has become a hot research topic, developing the urea injection strategy faces two challenges of accurately predicting ammonia (NH3) coverage and the complexity of two-stage SCR co-control. Therefore, first, control-oriented close-coupled SCR (ccSCR) and SCR models were established based on chemical reaction kinetic mechanism, mass conservation, and continuous stirred tank reactor law. The integrated model was established by coupling them with a control-oriented diesel oxidation catalyst model. Second, the effects of temperature, exhaust mass flow rate, oxygen concentration, NOX concentration, and nitrogen dioxide ratio on the NH3 coverage target value were investigated based on the integrated model. Third, a two-stage SCR co-control strategy was proposed. The NH3 coverage initial value and the threshold temperature for ccSCR to stop urea injection of the control strategy were optimized under the world harmonized transient cycle (WHTC). The results show that the NH3 coverage target value is most sensitive to temperature and decreases with increasing temperature. The composite tailpipe NOX under the WHTC is as low as 0.2 g/(kW<middle dot>h).

TI Organic Nitrogen Runoff in Coastal Marshes: Effects on Ecosystem
   Denitrification
SO ESTUARIES AND COASTS
AB Since the 1970s, a shift from inorganic to organic nitrogen-based fertilizer has occurred worldwide, and now urea constitutes greater than 50% of the global nitrogenous fertilizer usage. As a result, concentrations of urea will likely increase in waterways, facilitating transport to coastal wetland habitats where microbial-mediated transformations have the ability to alleviate excess nitrogen (N) pollution. To assess this biological potential for N removal in a brackish marsh ecosystem, we conducted a 5-day laboratory experiment where we monitored denitrification rate potentials (DNP) in microcosms with intact, vegetated sods, testing treatments of different urea solutions (37.5 and 166.5 mM urea) and a nitrate solution (98.9 mM KNO3). The addition of urea, regardless of concentration, did not stimulate DNP, while nitrate additions did. Ammonium (NH4+) accumulated in the porewater in response to urea treatments, with approximately 80-90 % of urea being hydrolyzed during the experiment. Nitrate concentrations in the nitrate treatment were near zero by the end of the experiment, while measureable amounts of urea were still present in both urea treatments. An increase in DNP followed nitrate additions, but an accumulation of NH4+ after urea additions suggests that urea pollution may not be removed by coastal wetlands as efficiently as nitrate pollution, especially when nitrification is limited under anaerobic conditions. Further work exploring the most likely pathways for removal of excess NH4+ is necessary to describe the potential impact that increased urea concentrations could have on coastal ecosystems.

TI Paracetamol Degradation and Disinfection Via Electrocatalytic Oxidation
   by Using N-doped Graphene as Anode
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB Simultaneous pollution degradation and disinfection were seldom discussed in the field of electrocatalytic oxidation. In this work, N-doped graphene (N-GN) was selected as anode to ensure the high performance of paracetamol (APAP) degradation. With N doping, the activity of N-GN is evidently improved because of the better surface area, active defects, and conductivity compared with graphene. The generation of active chlorine and O-2(center dot-) on the N-GN surface played an important role in APAP degradation. Compared with other operation parameters (such as pH and current density), environmental microorganisms exhibited more negative interference for APAP degradation. However, evident disinfection effects can be observed because of the release of fulvic and humic acids from microorganisms. In particular, active chlorine is evidently more effective than O-2(center dot-) for disinfection. The simultaneous APAP degradation and disinfection observed in this research provided the possible technology of electrocatalytic oxidation via N-GN for practical application.

TI Manganese porphines-NH2@SBA-15 as heterogeneous catalytic

SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS A-CHEMICAL
AB Two types of SBA-15 mesoporous silica were functionalized with different nitrogen-carbon chain lengths (long and short-chain) and then used as solid supports for immobilization of manganese(III) complex of meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine, [SBA-15-short-chain-NH2@Mn(TCPP)OAc] and [SBA-15-long-chain-NH2@Mn(TCPP)OAc]. The prepared catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR and UV vis spectroscopy. The loading of catalyst onto porous materials was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Thermal analysis also demonstrated that the immobilized catalysts are thermally stable up to almost 400 degrees C. A comparative study based on the difference in chain length of the functional groups of SBA-15 in the oxidation of olefins was carried out in the presence of urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) as oxidant and acetic anhydride as an activator. The novel long-chain catalyst was designed to improve performance of the catalytic activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Urease-free Ni microwires-intercalated Co-ZIF electrocatalyst for rapid
   detection of urea in human fluid and milk samples in diverse
   electrolytes
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Urea plays an important biological role in metabolism to determine the protein levels in the human body. The surplus limit of its prescribed level causes heart failure, dehydration, cachexia, and hepatic failure. Thus, accurate determination of urea is very important from the medical point of view. In this study, cobalt zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF)-nickel microwires (NiMWs) were synthesized through a simple one-pot solvothermal method. The microstructures and composition of the synthesized material were analysed by various spectral and microscopic techniques. The SEM images exhibited a well-defined spherical-like structure for Co-ZIF with a diameter of 3 mu m and NiMWs with a diameter of 1 mu m. XPS results clearly confirmed that the composite material contains both Co2+ and Ni-0 in its lattice. The composite material was then drop cast on GCE and the EIS analysis displayed lower R-CT = 7845 omega and higher kinetic rate constant (k(et) = 4.844 x 10(-4) cm(2) s(-1)) than those for bare GCE, Co-ZIF and NiMWs/GCEs. Electrochemical oxidation of urea was evaluated in various electrolytes at the composite fabricated electrode and the response in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was better than that in KOH, acetate and phosphate buffer solutions. The fabricated sensor exhibited a wide range for urea determination from 0.5 x 10(-6) M to 0.5 x 10(-3) M with the lowest LOD of 0.3 x 10(-6) M. Subsequently, the present sensor was successfully exploited to determine urea in human biological fluid and milk samples, and the results were confirmed with the enzymatic method used in the clinical laboratory. The proposed non-enzymatic urea sensor exhibited a wide linear range, lowest detection limit, good selectivity and sensitivity.

TI Identifying the active sites in C-N codoped TiO2 electrode
   for electrocatalytic water oxidation to produce
   H2O2
SO JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY
AB Unveiling the active site of an electrocatalyst is fundamental for the development of efficient electrode material. For the two-electron water oxidation to produce H2O2, competitive reactions, including four- and one-electron water oxidation and surface reconstruction derived from the high-oxidative environment co-existed, leading to great challenges to identify the real active sites on the electrode. In this work, Ti/TiO2-based electrodes calcined under air, nitrogen, or urea atmospheres were selected as electrocatalysts for two-electron water oxidation. Electrochemical analyses were applied to evaluate the catalytic activity and selectivity. The morphological and current change on the electrode surface were determined by scanning electrochemical microscopy, while the chemical and valence evolutions with depth distributions were tested by XPS combined with cluster argon ion sputtering. The results demonstrated that Ti/TiO2 nanotube arrays served as the support, while the functional groups of carbonyl groups and pyrrolic nitrogen derived from the co-pyrolysis with urea were the active sites for the H2O2 production. This finding provided a new horizon to design efficient catalysts for H2O2 production.

TI Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by graphitic carbon nitride
   polymers derived from urea and barbituric acid
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Conjugated carbon nitride nanosheets modified with barbituric acid (BA) were synthesized by a facile one-pot chemical condensation of urea. The obtained BA-modified carbon nitride samples were termed as CNU-BA(X) and were fully characterized by XRD, FTIR, XPS, NMR, EPR, FESEM, TEM, DRS, PL, BET and photocurrent measurements. The performance of the developed carbon nitride based semiconductors was investigated by applying them as polymeric photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 under visible light illumination. Results revealed that the copolymerization of urea with BA co-monomer strongly alternated the physical and chemical properties of carbon nitride polymer by improving optical absorption and creating surface molecular heterojunction that promoted charge separation, and consequently the enhanced photocatalytic performance was achieved. Various reaction parameters were investigated and optimized for the reaction system, and we found that under the optimal reaction condition, the best sample (CNU-BA(0.03)) could effectively photocatalyze the CO2-to-CO conversion reaction with 15-fold-enhanced catalytic activity, compared to the non-modified sample derived from urea (named as CNU). Other typical comonomers were also selected to polymerize with urea to study the beneficial effect of copolymerization on the development of efficient carbon nitride based nanostructures for CO2 photoreduction.

TI Defect Engineering, Electronic Structure, and Catalytic Properties of
   Perovskite Oxide La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB The electronic structures of transition metal oxides play a crucial role in the physical and chemical properties of solid materials. Defect engineering is an efficient way to regulate the electronic structure and improve the performance of materials. Here, we develop a defect engineering route that is implemented by controlling the topochemical reactions between cobalt perovskite and urea to optimize the electronic structure of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (LSCO). Urea pyrolysis is able to increase the oxygen defect concentration and cause octahedral distortions. Furthermore, we can distinctly observe that the introduction of oxygen vacancies narrows the hybridization orbital between O2p and Co 3d and optimizes the O p-band center near the Fermi level by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which greatly improves the catalytic activity of CO oxidation and photocatalytic water splitting. These results highlight the relationship between oxygen defects, electronic structure, and catalytic activity of perovskite LSCO, and demonstrate a rational approach to defect design and reveal the importance of anion redox chemistry for the structures and properties of perovskite oxides.

Thermal decomposition was carried out by the method of static experiments in an oxidizing (air) atmosphere at a 1-h exposure. The products of thermolysis were characterized by the X-ray diffraction method. The porous structure and the specific surface of the samples were determined. For Cr-Co systems at temperatures above 600 degrees C, the formation of a single-phase spinel of the composition Co1.5Cr1.5O4 was recorded, whereas for the Cr-Fe systems the formation of a mixed oxide phase (Fe, Cr)(2)O-3 occurred with heating up to 900 degrees C. It was shown that in all cases, as the temperature increased, the specific surface area decreased and the calculated particle size of the oxidation products increased. Thermolysis products were investigated in the model reaction of catalytic oxidation of acetone with air oxygen. The obtained values of the rate constants of the reaction show that the replacement of Fe with Co does not significantly affect the catalytic activity of the products, and only an increase in the temperature of thermolysis leads to a certain decrease in the catalytic activity.

TI Ultra-fine platinum species supported on niobium pentoxide for CO
   oxidation
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Platinum oxide supported on a Lewis acid niobium oxide (Nb2O5) support has been used for various heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. In this work, we used urea as a precipitating agent to obtain crystallized Nb2O5 with high surface area via a hydrothermal route. Nb2O5-supported Pt catalysts were subsequently synthesized via an incipient wetness impregnation approach. Multiple characterizations including X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption confirmed the identical structural and textural properties of the Nb2O5 support before and after the impregnation process. Furthermore, the X-ray absorption fine structure technique (XAFS) results with related data analysis indicate that the platinum species in the fresh and H-2-pretreated samples were in the form of single atoms or ultrafine clusters. In addition, the decrease in coordination number (CN) of the first-shell Pt-O bond, as well as the formation of Pt-Pt contribution with very low CN, after H-2-pretreatment was verified, which corresponds to the decrease of oxidation state for Pt species on the surface of supports. Thus, the ultrafine-clustered metallic Pt species are considered to be more active than the oxidized Pt single ions. The current results will be of great significance in controllable synthesis of active Pt-based catalysts for other catalytic oxidation reactions.

AB The enhancement of optical absorption performance is the premise and foundation of the improving of the photocatalytic efficiency. Nitrogen doping is an effective mean to enhance the optical absorption performance. In this study, a series of nitrogen-doped KTiNbO5 with the different reaction temperature and urea amounts are prepared by solid-phase reaction. The structure and doping behavior are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, laser Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The optical absorption performances of the N-doped KTiNbO5 are measured by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The results show that N-doped KTiNbO5 remains good crystalline and layered structure, with the increase of reaction temperature and urea amounts, the d-spacing decreases from 0.924 to 0.906 nm. The effects of the temperature and urea amounts on the optical performance are significative, the band gap energy decrease from 3.62 to 2.81 eV with the increase of reaction temperature and urea amounts. The structure determines the performance. The optical absorption performance is enhanced after N doping.

TI Highly Selective Electrooxidation of Urea to Nitrogen on Copper/Nickel
   Boride Interface under Alkaline Condition
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Urea electrooxidation reaction (UOR) plays an importantrole inenvironmental protection and energy regeneration. The extensivelystudied nickel-based catalysts exhibit good activity for UOR, buturea is more prone to be overelectrooxidized to another pollutantNO( x ) (-) (x = 2, 3). Herein, the Cu/Ni-B interface catalyst is presented. Theintroduction of Cu significantly enhances the Faradaic efficiencyof N-2 (nearly 70% at 1.70 V versus RHE). Electrochemicaltests and in situ Raman spectroscopy results show that the introductionof Cu significantly affects the density of OH* species on the catalystin the UOR process. It is proposed that with a moderate decrease inOH* density, the catalyst can provide enough sites for urea moleculesto allow simultaneous adsorption of the two N atoms, facilitatingthe process of N-N coupling to form N-2. This work is alsoinstructive for the design of electrocatalysts for other nucleophileelectrooxidation reactions.

TI Facilitating microplastic quantification through the introduction of a
   cellulose dissolution step prior to oxidation: Proof-of-concept and
   demonstration using diverse samples from the Inner Oslofjord, Norway
SO MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Identifying and quantifying microplastic in marine samples can be facilitated by removing natural organic matter (NOM). Cellulosic material, like chitin, however, are a type of NOM that is resistant to chemical digestion, and difficult to eliminate from samples. To address this, a two-step digestion method was developed to remove or reduce cellulosic materials in diverse marine media. This method was applied to reference microplastics, reference cellulosic materials, and diverse marine samples from the Inner Oslofjord Norway. This included plankton, seabed sediments near a water treatment plant and driftline sand. The method was developed and tested for plastic particles >45 mu m. The first-step was to pre-dissolve cellulosic materials using a mixture of urea:thiourea:NaOH. This was followed by an oxidative digestion step, here using H2O2 and NaOH. Most reference plastics were unaffected, except minor effects for PET and nylon. After sufficient repetitions, cellulosic materials in both reference and marine samples were largely removed. This method was compared to other digestion methods used for microplastic quantification, including single-step oxidation, alkaline treatment, acid treatment and enzymatic treatment. The results indicate that the pre-dissolution step greatly facilitates NOM and cellulosic material digestion for the purpose of microplastic quantification.

TI Kinetic mechanism of CO oxidation on gold catalyst supported on TiSBA-15
   previously treated in a hydrogen atmosphere
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The CO oxidation by supported gold catalysts on TiSBA-15 was investigated experimentally as well as via construction of a kinetic model. Functionalization of the siliceous mesoporous SBA-15 with titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Si/Ti: 20, 40 and 80 M ratios) was carried out to prepare gold mesoporous catalysts with 2.5-2.9 Au wt.% through the deposition-precipitation method assisted by urea. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption and TEM. The gold amount was determined by chemical analysis (ICP-OES). Before the CO oxidation, the samples were pretreated in air or H-2 atmosphere at 300, 400 or 500 degrees C. The functionalization of SBA-15 with Ti contributes to obtaining Au-0 nanoparticle sizes lower than 4 nm. Both the H-2 atmosphere for reducing Au species and Si/Ti molar ratio on the SBA-15 were crucial for increasing the catalytic activity. The catalytic evaluation showed that the highest CO conversion is achieved when the SBA-15 is enriched with a molar ratio of Si/Ti = 20 (Au/TiSBA20). Kinetic experiments over Au/TiSBA20 catalyst were then used to construct a series of kinetic models based on distinct mechanisms following a Langmuir-HinshelwoodHougen-Watson type. Statistical analysis addressing the physical meaning of the kinetic parameters allowed to elucidate two dual-site surface reactions with the adsorption of COx and O-2 on Au-0 nanoparticles (NPs) and in the periphery of the Au-0 NPs with the support, respectively, as a dominant mechanism. The estimated CO, CO2 and O-2 adsorption enthalpies amounted to -30, -39 and -13 kJ/mol, respectively, while the activation energies varied from 78.8 to 81.7 kJ/mol.

TI Simultaneous efficient production of hydrogen peroxide, urea and
   H2 by bifunctional Cu-doped TiO2 electrocatalyst
   from CO2, N2 and water
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The production of three separated, high-value chemicals (H2O2, urea and H-2) from CO2, N-2, and H2O represents a significant challenge. It is a prospective and innovative way to simultaneously produce these chemicals in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, which couples anodic 2e- water oxidation (2e-WOR) and cathodic CO2, N-2 and water reduction reaction (CNWRR), but has not yet been realized. Here, we found that bifunctional CuxTi(1-x)O(2-y) catalysts can be employed in the electrochemical production of H2O2, urea and H-2 from CO2, N-2 and water, and the optimized Cu0.12Ti0.88O2-y catalyst exhibits an excellent productivity of 11.8 mu mol cm(- 2) min(- 1), 0.3 mg cm(-2)h(- 1) and 0.82 mmol cm(-2)h(- 1) for H2O2, urea and H-2 at 4.0 V (50 mA cm(- 2)) in AEM electrolyzer, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior performance of the 2e-WOR and CNWRR is attributed to the Cu doping effect, which not only promotes the coupling of *OH but also optimizes the adsorption energy barriers of COOH* and NNH*. It is worth noting that the AEM electrolyzer assembled by bifunctional Cu0.12Ti0.88O2-y reaches a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with a cell voltage of 4.0 V and exhibits excellent stability of 50-hour continuous operation.

TI Catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of benzoic acid over Fe/AC catalysts:
   Effect of nitrogen and sulfur co-doped activated carbon
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The parent activated carbon (ACP) was modified with urea and thiourea to obtain N-doped activated carbon (ACN) and N, S co-doped activated carbon (ACNS), respectively. Iron supported on activated carbon (Fe/ACP, Fe/ACN and Fe/ACNS) were prepared and worked as catalyst for catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of benzoic acid (BA). The catalysts were characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), and their performance was evaluated in terms of benzoic acid and TOC removal. The results indicated the doped N and S improved the adsorption capacity as well as catalytic activity of activated carbon. Besides, the catalytic activity toward benzoic acid degradation was found to be enhanced by Fe/ACNS compared to that of Fe/ACP and Fe/ACN. The enhanced catalytic performance was attributed to the presence of the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may serve to improve the relative amount of Fe2+ on iron oxide surface and also help prevent leaching of Fe. It was also observed that the stability or reutilization of Fe/ACNS catalyst was fairly good. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Ni/NiO heterostructures encapsulated in oxygen-doped graphene as
   multifunctional electrocatalysts for the HER, UOR and HMF oxidation
   reaction
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Nickel (Ni)/nickel oxide heterostructures have been demonstrated to be promising candidates to replace catalysts based on conventional noble metals for electrochemical water splitting. Here we report a universal, controlled scalable arc-discharge method to produce Ni/NiO nanoparticles encapsulated in graphene as multifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction. We find that the catalytic activity of Ni/NiO@graphene can be altered dramatically by the electronic structure of the graphene layer which can be tuned by introducing oxygen dopants through a post-annealing process. Due to the synergistic effect of Ni nanoparticles, Ni/NiO heterostructures and the oxygen-doped graphene layer, the as-prepared catalysts show superior catalytic activity for the HER and UOR. The overall electrochemical water splitting in alkaline electrolyte with urea only requires 1.46 V. Moreover, the as-fabricated composites can catalyze the HMF oxidation reaction efficiently. This work provides a viable strategy to solve the energy challenge.

TI Contribution of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria to nitrogen
   transformation in a soil fertilized with urea and organic amendments
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The contribution of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) is crucial for nitrogen transformation. The effects of four organic amendments (OAs) plus urea on soil nitrogen transformation and the contribution of the ammonia-oxidizing microbial community were investigated using an incubation experiment. The OAs plus urea treatments included pig manure plus urea (PM + U), wheat straw plus urea (WS + U), compost plus urea (CP + U) and improved-compost plus urea (IC + U), while no OAs and urea amended control was noted as CK. The abundance and composition of AOA and AOB were determined using high through-put sequencing. Compared with CK, the OA plus urea treatments significantly enhanced the amount of total mineralized nitrogen released during the incubation process. After incubation, the highest mineralized nitrogen and net nitrogen mineralization was under the PM + U treatment and the lowest was in the WS + U treatment. In conclusion, among all OA plus urea treatments, the microbial biomass nitrogen content was the highest in WS + U treatment and dissolved organic nitrogen content was the highest with the PM + U treatment. Additionally, the abundance of AOB was inhibited in comparison to that of AOA; however, AOB contributed more to nitrification than AOA. Soil NO3--N and dissolved organic nitrogen were the principal components influencing the distribution of AOA and AOB. The result illustrated that the OAs plus urea, especially PM plus urea promoted mineralization to produce more dissolved organic nitrogen and NH4+-N, thus accelerating the growth of AOB to strengthen nitrification in soil.

TI Waste to Wealth: Discarded Cigarette Butt-Derived Metal-Free N-Rich
   Carbon Catalysts for the Selective Catalytic Oxidation of Hydrogen
   Sulfide to Sulfur
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The selective catalytic oxidation of toxic gas H2S to elemental sulfur (H2S-SCO) is a promising desulfurization process known for its dual benefits of recovering valuable sulfur resources and mitigating environmental pollution. Nevertheless, developing cost-effective and efficient catalysts for H2S-SCO remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized a low-cost and metal-free nitrogen-rich carbon catalyst (NrCC) by copyrolyzing discarded cigarette butts (organic solid wastes that are difficult to degrade naturally) with urea for the continuous H2S-SCO process at a relatively low temperature. The NrCC exhibited exceptional catalytic performance, achieving complete H2S conversion to sulfur at 180 degrees C, and demonstrated excellent stability in humid (RH = 80%) and high CO2 concentration environments. The catalyst succeeded due to its developed pore structure (specific surface area as high as 2267.77 m(2)<middle dot>g(-1)) and abundant pyridine-N sites. DFT calculations showed that the pyridine-N neighbor carbon sites were the active sites promoting H2S adsorption and dissociation. This study presents a novel "waste control by waste" strategy that integrates the utilization of organic solid waste resources with air pollution control measures, showcasing the potential for sustainable environmental solutions.

TI 3D self-supported porous vanadium-doped nickel nitride nanosheet arrays
   as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Electrocatalytic water splitting is an up-and-coming method to produce H-2, but it is mostly limited by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing the OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) process with a low thermodynamic potential would significantly reduce energy consumption. Here we developed porous V-doped Ni3N nanosheets arrays grown on nickel foam (labeled V-Ni3N/NF) by a hydrothermal and subsequent nitridation process. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the V-Ni3N/NF shows striking catalytic performances for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR, which require low potentials of -83 mV and 1.361 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, when applying V-Ni3N/NF as both the cathode and anode for the HER and UOR, the assembled electrolyzer needs small cell voltages of 1.416 and 1.543 V to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), which are 180 and 243 mV lower than that in traditional water electrolysis, as well as displaying remarkable stability over 200 h. The excellent catalytic performances can be attributed to the self-supported porous nanosheet arrays on 3D NF, the intrinsic conductivity of V-Ni3N, and the optimized Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption after V doping. Our result suggests that this attractive material has promising applications in energy-saving H-2 production and urea-related waste water treatment.

TI 2D Metal-organic framework derived Co/CoSe2 heterojunctions
   with interfacial electron redistribution as bifunctional
   electrocatalysts for urea-assisted rechargeable Zn-air batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The development of oxygen electrode reactions based on earth-abundant nonprecious materials is critically important for the substantial advancement of rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a superb bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of Co/CoSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped porous graphitized carbon structure (Co/CoSe2@CNx) has been successfully synthesized. This interface engineering strategy has proven to effectively tune charge redistribution to expedite the charge transfer while the porous graphitized carbon shells provide an optimized environment for charge and mass transport. Accordingly, the Co/CoSe2@CNx catalyst presents a narrow potential gap (Delta E = 0.54 V) between the UOR potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and the half-wave potential for ORR. Herein, the conceptual urea-assisted rechargeable ZABs with fast kinetics and low oxidation potential is demonstrated to remarkably decrease charging voltage and improve energy conversion efficiency. Further, the outstanding electrochemical performance of Co/CoSe2@CNx enables long-term rechargeability of urea-assisted ZABs, while improving the energy conversion efficiency by 11.8% compared with conventional ZABs. The implementation of urea-assisted rechargeable ZABs based on Co/CoSe2@CNx with enhanced energy conversion efficiency can promote the practical applications of the ZAB technology.

TI Hierarchical Superhydrophilic/Superaerophobic
   Ni3S2/VS2 Nanorod-Based Bifunctional
   Electrocatalyst Supported on Nickel Foam for Overall Urea Electrolysis
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The design and preparation of effective nonprecious metal-based catalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are of great significance to solve both energy shortage and environmental pollution problems. In this study, a novel hierarchical superhydrophilic and superaerophobicity three-dimensional nanorod-like bifunctional catalyst with a heterostructure (Ni3S2/VS2) was prepared on nickel foam via a simple one-step hydrothermal method, serving as an excellent electrocatalyst for both UOR and HER. The formed heterostructure significantly alters the electronic structure, optimizing charge transfer and increasing the number of active sites, which enhances the electrocatalytic performance of Ni3S2/VS2. As a result, this catalyst requires an extremely low potential of 1.396 V at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for UOR and only 164 mV overpotential at -10 mA cm(-2) for HER. Notably, a constructed two-electrode electrolyzer system (Ni3S2/VS2 parallel to Ni3S2/VS2) demonstrates extraordinary activity and long-term stability, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.48 V, which is superior to majority of the reported catalysts. This work demonstrates that the formation of heterostructures can effectively enhance the catalytic activity of nanomaterials toward UOR and HER and provides a feasible strategy for fabricating highly efficient nonprecious metal overall urea electrocatalysts.

TI (Imidazol-2-ylidene) → S coordination interactions and its modulation
   upon S-oxidation
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB (NHC) -> E coordination interactions are being explored in many chemical species, including carbones and nitreones. (NHC) -> S interactions are rare, but increasing attention is being paid to the compounds containing such interactions. The electron deficiency at the S centre is responsible for triggering electron donation from the NHC unit in (NHC) -> SR(+) systems. It is well known that the positive charge at the sulfur centre increases upon single oxidation and further increases upon double oxidation. This implies that (NHC) -> S interactions may become explicit after S-oxidation in the (NHC) -> SR((+) )systems. To explore this hypothesis, we performed quantum chemical design and synthesis of (NHC) -> SR(+), (NHC) -> S(O)R(+), and (NHC) -> S(O)(2)R(+) complexes in which the ligands are imidazol-2-ylidene derivatives. Eight derivatives of the (imidazol-2-ylidene) -> SR(+) systems were generated, and their sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives were obtained by oxidation using urea-H2O2 and mCPBA, respectively. The crystal structures of three compounds belonging to a series were determined. A comparison of the geometric, energetic and electronic characteristics confirmed the hypothesis that the (NHC) -> S coordination interaction becomes comparatively stronger with an increase in oxygen atoms at the sulfur centre.

TI Support induced phase engineering toward superior electrocatalyst
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB The phase transformation of catalysts has been extensively observed in heterogeneous catalytic reactions that hinder the long cycling catalysis, and it remains a big challenge to precisely control the active phase during the complex conditions in electrochemical catalysis. Here, we theoretically predict that carbon-based support could achieve the phase engineering regulation of catalysts by suppressing specific phase transformation. Taken single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) as typical support, combined with calculated E-pH (Pourbaix) diagram and advanced synchrotron-based characterizations technologies prove there are two different active phases source from cobalt selenide which demonstrate that the feasibility of using support effect regulating the potential advantageous catalysts. Moreover, it is worth noting that the phase engineering derived Co3O4-SWCNT exhibits a low overpotential of 201 mV for delivering the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Also, it reaches a record current density of 529 mA/cm(2) at 1.63 V (vs. RHE) in the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR), overwhelming most previously reported catalysts.

TI Electrocatalytic methanol oxidation using Ni-Co-graphene composite
   electrodes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Exacerbation of climate change has highlighted the need for new environmentally-friendly energy sources. Fuel cells, which are devices capable of extracting electricity directly from internal chemical reactions, represent one promising concept that allows electricity generation without burning fossil fuels. Direct methanol fuel cells are one of the most popular types, and they use methanol as the fuel for electricity production. However, the current lack of suitable electrocatalytic materials limits the application of such devices on an industrial scale. This report presents a simple, one-step method for the preparation of electrocatalytic materials for methanol oxidation. The developed composite materials contain two metals (nickel and cobalt), which both exhibit catalytic properties relevant for methanol electrooxidation, and graphene, which is a carbon nanomaterial that promotes facile charge transfer and enhanced material dispersion. The tested electrodes were prepared using an electrochemical deposition process, which allowed easy control of the process conditions, such as current density, and thus easy manipulation of the final material's properties. Following this process, stable electroactive materials were prepared, and the optimal results were obtained with the electrode prepared with a current density of 3.5 A dm-2 for 15 min: this electrode had a peak current density of 15.82 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH +1 M methanol solution.

AB Multicomponent iron-titanium-hafnium oxide materials with different compositions were prepared by combination of homogeneous precipitation with urea and incipient wetness impregnation techniques and tested as catalysts for ethyl acetate oxidation as representative VOCs. Nitrogen physisorption, XRD, Raman, UV-Vis, XPS, Mossbauer spectroscopy and TPR analyses reveal co-existence of substituted FeTi1 - xO2 oxide, finely dispersed iron oxide species with supper paramagnetic behavior and well crystallized alpha-F(e)2O(3) particles, which relative part depends on hafnium content in titania lattice.

TI Defects induced growth of Pt on the heterojunction of TaON|N-rGO as
   highly CO-tolerant electrocatalyst for ethylene glycol oxidation
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB For platinum (Pt) composite electrocatalysts formed by multiple components, the selective growth of Pt on oxygen-containing species can maximize the CO-resistance and durability, which is a big challenge in interfacial science. In this paper, Pt/TaON vertical bar N-rGO composite was obtained by an in-situ calcination of a layered supramolecule self-assembled by TaCl5, urea and n-butanol, followed with the targeted growth of Pt nanoparticles induced by the defects at the junction of TaON vertical bar N-rGO. As a result, Pt/TaON vertical bar N-rGO electrode with the ideal ternary interface of Pt vertical bar TaON vertical bar N-rGO exhibited exceptionally high catalytic mass activity (250.6 mA.mg(-1)Pt), excellent CO-tolerance (I-f/I-b = 1.6 normalized to Pt/C) and long-term durability (136.4 mA.mg(-1)Pt after continuous 1200 min operation) for EG oxidation in acid, compared to commercial Pt/C (57.8 mA.mg(-1)Pt). The promoted performance was attributed to the synergies at ternary interface of Pt vertical bar TaON vertical bar N-rGO, and the boosting CO-tolerance was achieved by the shortened L-H pathway ascribed to the selective growth of Pt nanoparticles on the heterojunction of TaON vertical bar N-rGO.

TI Synergistically coupling of ultrathin Ni3N layer with Ti3C2Tx-MXene
   nanosheets for efficient benzyl alcohol oxidation reactions and hydrogen
   production
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB The coupling of electrocatalytic benzyl alcohol (Ph-CH2OH) oxidation with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has emerged as a promising approach to increase the overall efficiency of hydrogen production. However, designing bifunctional electrocatalysts with both high activity and selectivity remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a new strategy for constructing ultrathin Ni3N nanosheets coupled with MXene using a cyanogel synthetic approach. Benefiting from the abundant catalytic sites in ultrathin Ni3N nanosheets, and the unique hydrophilicity and high conductivity of MXene, the MXene/Ni3N electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic Ph-CH2OH oxidation activity, achieving a 97.6 % selectivity towards benzoic acid (Ph-COOH) and a remarkable 95.6 % faradaic efficiency (FE). Notably, in weakly alkaline electrolytes, MXene/Ni3N nanocomposites can selectively produce benzaldehyde (Ph-CHO). Moreover, the MXene/Ni3N nanocomposites also show excellent catalytic activity for HER, exhibiting a low overpotential of 147 mV at 10 mA cm -2. This work presents a viable strategy for developing advanced, dual -function electrocatalysts.

TI Nanostructured Metallic Glass in a Highly Upgraded Energy State
   Contributing to Efficient Catalytic Performance
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Metallic glasses (MGs), with high density of low coordination sites and high Gibbs free energy state, are novel promising and competitive candidates in the family of electrochemical catalysts. However, it remains a grand challenge to modify the properties of MGs by control of the disordered atomic structure. Recently, nanostructured metallic glasses (NGs), consisting of amorphous nanometer-sized grains connected by amorphous interfaces, have been reported to exhibit tunable properties compared to the MGs with identical chemical composition. Here, it is demonstrated that electrodeposited Ni-P NG is characterized by an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes the catalytic performance. Moreover, the Ni-P NG with a heterogeneous structure is a perfect precursor for the fabrication of unique honey-like nanoporous structure, which displays superior catalytic performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specifically, modified Ni-P NG requires a potential of mere 1.36 V at 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 13 mV dec(-1), which is the best UOR performance in Ni-based alloys. The present work demonstrates that the nanostructurization of MGs provides a universal and effective pathway to upgrade the energy state of MGs for the design of high-performance catalysts in energy conversion.

TI Synthesis of Al2O3, MgO and
   MgAl2O4 by solution combustion method and
   investigation of performances in partial oxidation of methane
SO POWDER TECHNOLOGY
AB Al2O3, MgO and MgAl2O4 nanocrystalline and mesoporous materials were prepared by simple solution combustion synthesis using urea and metal nitrates and the effect of metal nitrate/urea ratio was investigated. The metal oxides that were found suitable for catalytic purposes were tested in catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPOM). It was observed that the oxidizer/fuel ratio could affect the structure phase, crystallinity and morphology of the synthesized materials. gamma-Al2O3 was obtained when the equivalence ratio was 2, and at lower ratios, the obtained phase was alpha-Al2O3. The cubic MgO phase was obtained at each ratio but the material yield was low below the equivalence ratio of 4. Highly crystalline MgAl2O4 was obtained at fuel-rich conditions only. 10% (wt.) Ni loaded MgAl2O4-2 and MgO-4 showed high activity (>90% CH4 conversion) and product selectivity (>98% H-2 and CO selectivity) at 800 degrees C under 157,5001 kg(-1) h(-1). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Cu-Mn-O nano-particle/nano-sheet spinel-type materials as catalysts in
   methanol steam reforming (MSR) and preferential oxidation (PROX)
   reaction for purified hydrogen production
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Nanocomposite Cu-Mn-O nano-particle (CuMnNP) and nano-sheet (CuMnNS) catalyst were successfully prepared using a one-step hydrothermal method in the absence of any templating reagent. Materials were characterised applying various structural techniques. SEM images showed that composite Cu -Mn oxide sheets were tailor-made synthesised by a one-pot urea-abetted protocol. Conversely, upon replacing carbamate by Na2CO3, oxidised metal Cu-Mn particles could be obtained. The formation of bulk mixed Cu-Mn phases resulted in an enhanced crystal lattice oxygen reactivity in CuMnNS. XPS, XRD and TPR measurements confirmed the presence of the Cu+ and Cu2+ species in nano-catalysts, and CuMnNS nanomaterials possessed more surface defects, thus causing a higher 0 2 adsorption/storage capacity. CuMnNS presented a superior catalytic activity as opposed to CuMnNP in the preferential oxidation (PROX) pathway of CO. With both CO2 and H2O in feed, a decrease in CO turnover was observed, due to a competitive interface binding of CO, CO2 and H2O. Compared to CuMnNP, CuMnNS also demonstrated a high time-on-stream conversion of methanol for the reforming for all operating conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY
AB Reaction of the binucleating S-protected ligand precursors 2-(N,N-dimethylthiocarbamato)-5-methylisophthalaldehyde di-2-hydroxy anil (I) and 2-(N,N-dimethylthiocarbamato)-5-methylisophthalaldehyde di-2-hydroxy 5-methyl anil (II) with nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate in the presence of pyrazole afforded the binuclear nickel(II) complexes [(LNi2)-Ni-I(pz)] (1) and [(LNi2)-Ni-II(pz)] (2), respectively. The complexes have been characterized by routine physicochemical studies as well as by X-ray single crystal structure analysis. In both complexes, Ni(II) ions are doubly bridged by the thiophenolic sulfur of the pentadentate Schiff base ligand and a pyrazolate group. Efficient protocols for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides with high selectivities, catalyzed by binuclear -thiophenolato--pyrazolatonickel(II) in the presence of urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) were explored. We obtained predominantly the monooxygenated product. The resulting products are obtained in good to excellent yields within a reasonable time.

TI Positive effects of a halloysite-supported Cu/Co catalyst fabricated by
   a urea-driven deposition precipitation method on the CO-SCR reaction and
   SO2 poisoning
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Cu/Co catalysts were prepared on halloysite nanotube supports by a urea-driven deposition-precipitation method for CO oxidation and the selective catalytic reduction of NO (CO-SCR). First, the Cu/NH3 molar ratio was investigated to identify the copper species in the catalysts and evaluate the CO oxidation ability. According to the results, the relative amount of [Cu(NH3)(4)](2+) species increases with increasing urea concentration, and the Cu/halloysite-1/6 catalyst exhibits strong metal-support interactions and has well-dispersed CuO particles at a Cu/NH3 molar ratio of 1/6. Moreover, the interaction between [Cu(NH3)(4)](2+) and halloysite is enhanced by electrostatic effects, which helps suppress particle migration and sintering. In addition, the promotion effects of cobalt on CuCo/HNT in the NO + CO and NO + CO + SO2 reactions were also examined. The results suggest that a strong synergistic effect between Cu and Co in the catalyst can improve their reducibilities; thus, the CO and NO conversions are greatly increased by 50% at 400 degrees C. Moreover, CuCo/HNT exhibits higher SO2 resistance than Cu/HNT-1/6, and it can maintain 30% CO and NO conversion after SO2 poisoning.

TI Postruminal protein supply upregulates hepatic lysine oxidation and
   ornithine transcarbamoylase in lactating dairy cattle
SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
AB Metabolizable protein supply is a limiting factor for milk production in dairy cows, and the availability of AA is a function of the quantity of the metabolizable protein available and of hepatic AA catabolism. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of postruminal protein infusion on key genes for ureagenesis and AA catabolism. Six multiparous Holstein cows in early lactation were used in a replicated crossover design. Cows were fed a TMR and infused postruminally with either 0 or 600 g/d of milk protein isolate. Periods were 21 d long, consisting of 14 d of adjustment to surroundings, followed by 7 d of protein infusion. On the last day of each infusion, liver samples were collected for mRNA analysis and explant culture, milk samples were collected for mRNA analysis, and blood samples were collected for plasma metabolite analysis. Postruminal infusion of protein increased milk yield by 10.5%, milk fat yield by 12.5%, milk protein yield by 20%, milk lactose yield by 11%, and total solids yield by 15.5%. Postruminal infusion of protein increased milk urea N by 23.5%, blood urea N by 18.6%, and the abundance of hepatic ornithine transcarbamoylase mRNA by 52.8%. Postruminal infusion of protein did not alter the mRNA abundance of hepatic argininosuccinate synthase, alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde synthase, cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase, or cystathionase. The abundance of RNA for milk proteins was unchanged with postruminal protein infusion. Metabolism of L-[U C-14] Lys to CO2 was increased by 127% (0.143 vs. 0.063 +/- 0.04 nmol product.mg tissue(-1).h(-1)), and the metabolism of L-[U C-14] Ala to CO2 increased by 40.5% (0.52 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.06 nmol product.mg tissue(-1).h(-1)) with postruminal protein infusion. The rate of L-[1-C-14] Met oxidation did not differ. These data indicate increased ureagenesis matched by upregulation of nonessential AA catabolism and a disproportional increase in Lys oxidation in response to increased postruminal protein infusion.

TI Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria rather than archaea respond to shortterm urea
   amendment in an alpine grassland
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), are used in grasslands to maximize plant biomass production for livestock. Despite a substantial body of work on how fertilization affects aboveground plant and belowground microbial communities, the short-term response of soil ammonia oxidizing microbial communities, which play the central role in nitrification, to fertilization is not well understood. The responses of ammonia-oxidizing microbial communities to short-term (3 years) N and/or P additions were investigated in an alpine grassland of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the amoA genes showed that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) dominated over ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in non-amended soil. Short-term urea addition significantly increased the abundance of AOB, whereas AOA abundance remained unchanged, resulting in a shift from AOA to AOB dominance, which suggests that AOB are likely to be more important in the first step of the nitrification following urea amendment. Pyrosequencing demonstrated a significant shift in AOB but not AOA community composition within short-term N fertilizer plots, indicating that AOB community composition was more sensitive than AOA in response to urea amendment. This study demonstrated that the abundance and composition of AOA and AOB communities responded differently to 3 years of urea addition, suggesting that N fertilizer may be an important controller of ammonia oxidizing microbial communities in managed alpine grasslands, such as those of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

   Enteromorpha after urea-saturation for Fenton-like reaction
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB Fabrication of single atom catalysts (SACs) by a green and gentle method is important for their practical Fenton-like use. In this work, a high effective iron-based catalyst was prepared from the iron-rich Enteromorpha for NPX degradation via peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Both Fe-SACs and iron-clusters was fabricated from the intrinsic iron element in Enteromorpha after the urea saturation. The Fe-SACs/clusters can achieve 100% of NPX oxidation within 20 min with the kobs of 0.282 min-1. Quenching tests indicated that the radical pathways were not dominated in the catalytic systems, and strong electron transfer process can be induced in the Fe-SACs/clusters + PMS system by using the NPX as electron donor and FeSACs/clusters/PMS* complexes as electron acceptor. This result was consistent with the phenomenon observed in the galvanic oxidation system. In addition, the Fe-SACs/clusters was deposited onto the ceramic membrane (CM) by the spraying-crosslinking process to form a Fe-SACs/clusters@CM, which showed an effective and continuous NPX degradation in a heterogeneous PMS system.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

TI P-, B- and N-doped carbon black for the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation
   of phenol: Activity, stability and kinetic studies
SO CATALYSIS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Doped carbon blacks with P, B and N were prepared and tested as catalysts for the wet peroxide oxidation of phenol. N precursors allowed incorporating a higher amount of the doping element on the outermost surface. Phosphoric and boric acids as well as urea and pyridine yielded doped carbons with significantly high activity for the oxidation and mineralization of phenol and its aromatic intermediates. The kinetic model applied, scarcely reported on doped-carbons, showed reaction rate constants values up to eight times larger than those of the original carbon. This behavior was attributed to the more acidic character of doped-carbons.

TI RETRACTED: Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF Hybrid Nanostructure as
   Effective Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Urea Electrolysis Assisted
   Hydrogen Evolution (Retracted article. See vol. 172, 2025)
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Substituting the smaller theoretical applied potential of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for the larger theoretical potential of anodic water electrolysis (oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) is critical for the energy requirement in the evolution of hydrogen. In this work, a brief and scalable strategy was presented to synthesize nickel sulfide and multi-walled carbon nanotube composites on Ni foam, denoted as Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF. Electrochemical measurements show that Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF can be an efficient electrocatalyst for UOR. A potential of 1.338 V was required at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2)for UOR with Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF. This UOR catalyst was used to replace OER for hydrogen production, which reduced the overpotential required for H-2-production and reduced overall power consumption. Also, the Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF catalyst exhibited high electrocatalytic efficiency to evolve hydrogen, which provided a low overpotential of only 104 mV at 10 mAcm(-2). As a proof of concept, a water-urea electrolysis measurement was carried out in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea using Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF as the cathode and anode, respectively. Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF divide divide Ni3S2/MWCNTs/NF electrodes provided a current density of 10 mAcm(-2)at a voltage of 1.509 V, which was 149 mV lower than that of water splitting, which proved that this catalyst may be commercially viable in energy-saving hydrogen production.

TI Membrane-Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane-electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which makes the cost of green hydrogen (H2) generation much higher than that of grey H2. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane-free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously. This system utilizes the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to generate clean N2 over a new class of Cu-based catalyst (CuXO) for replacing OER, fundamentally eliminating the explosion risk of H2 and O2 mixing while removing the need for membranes. Notably, this membrane-free electrolysis system exhibits the highest H2 Faradaic efficiency among reported membrane-free electrolysis work. In situ spectroscopic studies reveal that the new N2Hy intermediate-mediated UOR mechanism on the CuXO catalyst ensures its unique N2 selectivity and OER inertness. More importantly, an industrial-type membrane-free water electrolyser (MFE) based on this system successfully reduces electricity consumption to only 3.78 kWh Nm-3, significantly lower than the 5.17 kWh Nm-3 of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE). Comprehensive techno-economic analysis (TEA) suggests that the membrane-free design and reduced electricity input of the MFE plants reduce the green H2 production cost to US$1.81 kg-1, which is lower than those of grey H2 while meeting the technical target (US$2.00-2.50 kg-1) set by European Commission and United States Department of Energy.

TI Interface engineering of three-phase nickel-cobalt sulfide/nickel
   phosphide/iron phosphide heterostructure for enhanced water splitting
   and urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Rational designing efficient transition metal-based multifunctional electrocatalysts is highly desirable for improving the efficiency of hydrogen production from water cracking. Herein, a self-supported three-phase heterostructure electrocatalyst of nickel-cobalt sulfide/nickel phosphide/iron phosphide (CoNi5S8-Ni2P-FeP2) was prepared by a two-step gas-phase sulfurization/phosphorization strategy. The heterostructure in CoNi5S8Ni2P-FeP2 provides a favorable interfacial environment for electron transfer and synergistic interaction of multiphase active components, while the introduced electronegative P/S not only serves as a carrier for proton capture in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process but also promotes the metal-electron outflow, which in turn accelerates the generation of high-valent Ni3+ species to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). As expected, CoNi5S8-Ni2P-FeP2 reveals excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic properties. An overpotential of 35/215 mV is required to reach 10 mA cm-2 for HER/ OER. More encouragingly, a current of 100 mA cm-2 requires only 1.36 V for UOR with CoNi5S8-Ni2P-FeP2 as anode, which is much lower as compared to the OER (1.50 V). Besides, a two-electrode water/urea electrolyzer assembled based on CoNi5S8-Ni2P-FeP2 has a voltage of only 1.59/1.48 V when the system reaches 50 mA cm-2. This work provides a new idea for the design of energy -efficient water/urea-assisted water -splitting multifunctional catalysts with multi -component heterostructure synergistic interface engineering.

TI Surface oxygenous groups modified graphitic carbon nitride with
   significant positive shift of valence band for efficient photocatalytic
   oxidation
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a remarkable metal-free photocatalyst which is widely used for photocatalytic reductive reaction due to its suitable potential of conduction band, but also suffers from intrinsically weak photocatalytic oxidation ability. Here, by simply refluxing g-C3N4 in H2O2, oxygenous groups are introduced into g-C3N4. The resultant oxygenous groups modified g-C3N4 (g-C3N4 (H2O2)) exhibits significantly improved hydrophilic ability and photocatalytic oxidative ability. It is well evidenced that valence band position is positive shifted significantly by introduction of surface oxygenous groups. However, the photocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution is not improved obviously, suggesting that the driving force for water oxidation is not increased simultaneously. Luckily, the photocatalytic oxidative activity of the modified g-C3N4 (include oxygen evolution, pollutant degradation and antibacterial property) could be further improved after forming TiO2 containing nanocomposites during the H2O2 reflux treatment with the addition of tertrabutyl titanate (g-C3N4/ TiO2 (H2O2) due to much increased driving force and accelerated charge migration. Herein, a facile and simple method is proposed to engineer the band structure of g-C3N4 for improving its photocatalytic oxidative ability, which expand the application of carbon nitride.

TI Comparison of grain yields and N2O emissions on Oxisol and
   Vertisol soils in response to fertiliser N applied as urea or urea
   coated with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate
SO SOIL RESEARCH
AB The potential for elevated nitrous oxide (N2O) losses is high in subtropical cereal cropping systems in northeast Australia, where the fertiliser nitrogen (N) input is one single application at or before planting. The use of urea coated with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) has been reported to substantially decrease N2O emissions and increase crop yields in humid, high-intensity rainfall environments. However, it is still uncertain whether this product is similarly effective in contrasting soil types in the cropping region of north-east Australia. In this study the grain yield response of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) to rates of fertiliser N applied as urea or urea coated with DMPP were compared in crops grown on a Vertisol and an Oxisol in southern Queensland. Seasonal N2O emissions were monitored on selected treatments for the duration of the cropping season and the early stages of a subsequent fallow period using a fully automated high-frequency greenhouse gas measuring system. On each soil the tested treatments included an unfertilised control (0 kg N ha(-1)) and two fertilised treatments chosen on the basis of delivering at least 90% of seasonal potential grain yield (160 and 120 kg N ha(-1) on the Vertisol and Oxisol respectively) or at a common (suboptimal) rate at each site (80 kg N ha(-1)). During this study DMPP had a similar impact at both sites, clearly inhibiting nitrification for up to 8 weeks after fertiliser application. Despite the relatively dry seasonal conditions during most of the monitoring period, DMPP was effective in abating N2O emissions on both soils and on average reduced seasonal N2O emissions by 60% compared with conventional urea at fertiliser N rates equivalent to those producing 90% of site maximum grain yield. The significant abatement of N2O emissions observed with DMPP, however, did not translate into significant yield gains or improvements in agronomic efficiencies of fertiliser N use. These results may be due to the relatively dry growing season conditions before the bulk of crop N acquisition, which limited the exposure of fertiliser N to large losses due to leaching and denitrification.

TI Identification and manipulation of dynamic active site
   deficiency-induced competing reactions in electrocatalytic oxidation
   processes
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Electrocatalytic organic compound oxidation reactions (OCORs) have been intensively studied for energy and environmentally benign applications. However, relatively little effort has been devoted to developing a fundamental understanding of OCORs, including the detailed competition with side reactions and activity limitations, thus inhibiting the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, by taking the NiWO4-catalysed urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in aqueous media as an example, the competition between the OCOR and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within a wide potential range is examined. It is shown that the root of the competition can be ascribed to insufficient surface concentration of dynamic Ni3+, an active site shared by both the UOR and OER. A similar phenomenon is observed in other OCOR electrocatalysts and systems. To address the issue, a "controllable reconstruction of pseudo-crystalline bimetal oxides" design strategy is proposed to maximise the dynamic Ni3+ population and manipulate the competition between the UOR and the OER. The optimised electrocatalyst delivers best-in-class performance and an similar to 10-fold increase in current density at 1.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode for alkaline urea electrolysis compared to those of the pristine materials.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Urea-functionalized porphyrin catalysts containing a cavity, which are used for the processive epoxidation of polymers, are thoroughly characterized and their binding properties and other supramolecular features disclosed. Intramolecular coordination of the urea side chains to the metal center of the porphyrin moiety is unveiled through NMR, IR, UV, and fluorescence spectroscopy studies. This intramolecular coordination appears to be essential in order to facilitate catalysis in a pseudo-rotaxane fashion, i.e. by preventing the use of an excess of bulky axial ligands. The current investigation provides information on how to modulate in a dynamic fashion the catalytic activity of supramolecular systems, which is of interest for the design of increasingly efficient processive catalysts.

TI Co5.47N/rGO@NF as a High-Performance Bifunctional Catalyst
   for Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Evolution
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB The hydrogen produced by water splitting is limited due to the high theoretical potential of the anode. So, the lower theoretical potential of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) was selected. In this work, a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst, cobalt nitride doped with reduced graphene oxide nanosheets supported on Ni foam (Co5.47N/rGO@NF), was synthesized by hydrothermal and calcination methods for both UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The morphology and composition of Co5.47N/rGO@NF was studied through XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and elemental mapping. A parallel two-electrode electrolyzer (Co5.47N/rGO@NF parallel to Co5.47N/rGO@NF) was constructed for electrochemical testing. To drive 100 mA/cm(2), the voltage of Co5.47N/rGO@ NF parallel to Co5.47N/rGO@NF only 1.684 V is required, which is much lower than that of Pt/C parallel to IrO2 (1.875 V) and the current density can be maintained for at least 30 h. This demonstrates that its high activity and stability have commercial feasibility.

TI Constructing nanoporous crystalline/amorphous NiFe2O4/NiO
   electrocatalyst for high efficiency OER/UOR
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Exploring highly efficient, stable and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a challenging task for energy-saving H2 generation during water electrolysis. Herein, a rose-like crystalline/amorphous heterostructure of NiFe2O4/NiO/NF grown on Ni-foam (NF) was synthesized via a simple two-step (i.e. , hydrothermal-annealing) pathway. The as-synthesized NiFe2O4/NiO/ NF catalyst presents outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards OER with small overpotentials of 122 and 145 mV to deliver 20 and 100 mA cm-2 current densities in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. Further, the electrocatalyst revealed robust stability for over 168 h. For UOR, ultra-low potentials of 1.181 and 1.315 V (vs. the RHE) are required at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, relatively lower than those required for the OER process. Furthermore, employing the NiFe2O4/NiO/NF catalyst as an anode and Pt/C/NF as a cathode in 1 M KOH electrolyte, only 1.356 and 1.498 V is required to drive current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 300 mA cm-2 during the overall water splitting reaction. Significantly, the urea electrolyzer presents ultra-low cell voltages of 1.218 and 1.490 V at 10 and 300 mA cm-2 current densities, respectively. The performance of the electrocatalyst is better than many of the reported transition-metal based elec-trocatalysts and even superior to most of the noble metal-based electrocatalysts. This work presents a solid step for the cost-effective and energy-saving hydrogen generation. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Application effects of coated urea and urease and nitrification
   inhibitors on ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions from a subtropical
   cotton field of the Mississippi delta region
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Nitrogen (N) fertilization affects both ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that have implications in air quality and global warming potential. Different cropping systems practice varying N fertilizations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of applications of polymer-coated urea and urea treated with N process inhibitors: NBPT [N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide], urease inhibitor, and DCD [Dicyandiamide], nitrification inhibitor, on NH3 and GHG emissions from a cotton production systemin the Mississippi delta region. A two-year field experiment consisting of five treatments including the Check (unfertilized), urea, polymer-coated urea (ESN), urea + NBPT, and urea + DCD was conducted over 2013 and 2014 in a Cancienne loam (Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, hyperthermic Fluvaquentic Epiaquepts). Ammonia and GHG samples were collected using active and passive chamber methods, respectively, and characterized. The results showed that the N loss to the atmosphere following urea-N application was dominated by a significantly higher emission of N2O-N than NH3-N and the most N2O-N and NH3-N emissions were during the first 30-50 days. Among different N treatments compared to regular urea, NBPT was the most effective in reducing NH3-N volatilization (by 58-63%), whereas DCD the most significant in mitigating N2O-N emissions (by 75%). Polymer-coated urea (ESN) and NBPT also significantly reduced N2O-N losses (both by 52%) over urea. The emission factors (EFs) for urea, ESN, urea-NBPT, urea + DCD were 1.9%, 1.0%, 0.2%, 0.8% for NH3-N, and 8.3%, 3.4%, 3.9%, 1.0% for N2O-N, respectively. There were no significant effects of different N treatments on CO2-C and CH4-C fluxes. Overall both of these N stabilizers and polymer-coated urea could be used as a mitigation strategy for reducing N2O emission while urease inhibitor NBPT for reducing NH3 emission in the subtropical cotton production system of the Mississippi delta region.

TI Interface engineering of Ni3S2@NiFe-LDH core-shell
   heterostructure to achieve energy-saving hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Developing highly active and cost-effective catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is crucial to accelerate the scale-up of hydrogen production. However, their potentials in widespread use have been locked owing to the sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we present a unique threedimensional heterostructure, in which the self-supported Ni3S2 nanorods are wrapped by ultrathin nickel-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets on nickel foam (Ni3S2@NiFe-LDH/NF). Benefiting from the uniform core-shell architecture and the modulated electronic structure, Ni3S2@NiFe-LDH/NF demonstrates superior activities for both OER and UOR. The electrode manifests an ultralow overpotential of 300 mV is required for OER to attain 100 mA cm- 2 and operates stably for 200 h at 100 mA cm- 2. Impressively, the UOR and overall waterurea electrolysis solely require 1.38 V vs. RHE and 1.43 V to supply 100 mA cm- 2, greatly reducing the overall energy consumption in 1.0 M KOH with a 0.33 M urea. The in-situ Raman characterization results show that Ni3S2@NiFe-LDH undergoes surface reconstruction into crystalline gamma-Ni(Fe)OOH during OER, while it transforms into amorphous a-Ni(Fe)OOH during UOR. This work demonstrates an effective interfacial engineering strategy to develop Ni-based catalysts, enabling energy-saving H2 production by efficient OER and UOR.

TI Low-Temperature Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx with
   Urea Supported on Carbon Xerogels
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Low-temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx on urea-supported carbon xerogels is studied. The kinetics results show that the orders of reaction for NO and O-2 are 1 and 0.5 for NO reduction, while the orders of reaction for NO2 and O-2 are 1 and 0.03 for NO2 reduction, respectively. The apparent activation energies of NO and NO2 reduction are calculated to be -14.0 and 0.79 kJ/mol, respectively. Possible mechanisms are proposed, based on the hypothesis that there exist two kinds of active sites on the surface of carbon xerogel, including nonreductive and reductive ones. Spillover of the NO3 species generated on the nonreductive ones into the reductive ones which are subsequently oxidized by NO3 and the migration of Time NO3 species from nonreductive ones into the oxidized carbon sites are considered to be of great importance for the successive urea-SCR process and the formation of steady-state NOx removal period.

TI Electrochemically sandwiched poly(diphenylamine)/phosphotungstic
   acid/graphene nanohybrid as highly sensitive and selective urea
   biosensor
SO SYNTHETIC METALS
AB An amperometric urea biosensor was fabricated using Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated Polydiphenylamine (PDPA)/Phosphotungstic acid (PTA)/Graphene (Gra) hybrid nanocomposites modified electrode (ITO/PDPA/PTA/Gra-ME) by an electrochemical-deposition technique. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force microscopy (AFM) techniques were used to capture the surface morphology and surface coating thickness of nanocomposite sandwiched electrodes. Electro-catalytic performances of modified hybrid electrodes were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronoamperometry (CA) techniques. ITO/PDPA/PTA/Gra-ME exhibits a good linear response to urea concentration over the range of 1-13 mu M along with a correlation coefficient of 0.999, good sensitivity (1.085 mu A/mu M cm(2)) and at a low response time (5 s). The enhanced electro-catalytic activity of ITO/PDPA/PTA/Gra-sandwich towards urea was owing to the synergistic contribution of tungsten atoms (phosphotungstic acid anion), diphenoquinone diamine (DPDI2+) form of PDPA/Graphene that enhances the fast electron transfer rate. Also, interfering analytes were studied to ensure the fabricated sensor is best suitable for practical applications.

TI EGCG has Dual and Opposing Effects on the N-terminal Region of
   Self-associat-ing a-synuclein Oligomers
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Oligomers of the protein a-synuclein (a-syn) are thought to be a major toxic species in Parkinson's dis-ease, particularly through their ability to permeabilize cell membranes. The green tea polyphenol epigal-locatechin gallate (EGCG) has been found to reduce this ability. We have analyzed a-syn oligomer dynamics and interconversion by H/D exchange monitored by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Our results show that the two oligomers OI and OII co-exist in equilibrium; OI is a multimer of OII and its dissociation can be followed by HDX-MS by virtue of the correlated exchange of the N-terminal region. Urea destabi-lizes the a-syn oligomers, dissociating OI to OII and monomers. Oligomers exposed to EGCG undergo Met oxidation. Intriguingly, EGCG induces an oxidation-dependent effect on the structure of the N -terminal region. For the non-oxidized N-terminal region, EGCG increases the stability of the folded struc-ture as measured by a higher level of protection against H/D exchange. In contrast, protection is clearly abrogated in the Met oxidized N-terminal region. Having a non-oxidized and disordered N-terminal region is known to be essential for efficient membrane binding. Therefore, our results suggest that the combined effect of a structural stabilization of the non-oxidized N-terminal region and the presence of a disordered oxidized N-terminal region renders the oligomers less cytotoxic by decreasing the ability of the N-terminal region to bind to cell membranes and facilitate their permeabilization.

TI Palladium electrochemistry in the choline chloride-urea deep eutectic
   solvent at gold and glassy carbon electrodes
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The electrochemical behaviour of Pd(II) in choline chloride-urea eutectic (ChCl-U) has been investigated at polycrystalline gold and glassy carbon electrodes at 60 degrees C using voltammetry (cyclic and hydrodynamic) and chronoamperometry. The voltammograms recorded at Au in the palladium solution show three reduction signals, assigned to Pd bulk deposition (around -0.2 V vs. Ag QRE), the formation of palladium hydrides PdHx (around -0.4 V vs. Ag QRE) and an underpotential deposition (upd) of Pd (around 0 V vs. Ag QRE). Two anodic peaks present in the cyclic voltammograms correspond to the oxidation of Pd hydrides and Pd deposits. In contrast to the results obtained at Au, no upd response is observed at a GC electrode and a crossover between the forward and backward scan, characteristic of a kinetic control by nucleation and growth, is clearly evidenced. Typical peaked transients are observed whose analysis unambiguously demonstrates that the deposition occurs through a 3D progressive nucleation mechanism. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The maximum adsorbable amount, available adsorption amount for NOx reduction, and maximum adsorption amount before NH3 slip were separately measured. The results of the three types of adsorption amounts show that the optimum operating range for urea control gradually narrowed for high exhaust gas temperatures. Furthermore, it was found to be particularly challenging to completely remove NH3 slip without ammonia oxidation catalyst in the transient operation of the engine.

TI Urea-modified grass ash activated sludge carbon: structure and
   adsorption properties towards H2S and CH3SH
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The sludge from a sewage treatment plant was used as the raw material, the plant ash was used as the activator, urea was used as the modifier and the sludge was used to prepare the sludge carbon material. Orthogonal tests were designed to determine the best preparation conditions for the samples. The structure and deodorization products of sludge carbon were analyzed by SEM, FT-IR, XPS, specific surface area and pore structure analyses. The results showed that the sludge carbon T(550)U(1.5)t(60)SAC had the best deodorization performance when the pyrolysis temperature was 550 degrees C, the stucco/drug ratio was 1 : 1.5, and the pyrolysis time was 60 min under N-2 atmosphere. The penetration time for hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan reached 200 min and 100 min, respectively. Structural analysis showed that the T(550)U(1.5)t(60)SAC carbon material had a rough surface and wide pore diameter distribution. It not only had oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface, but the concentration of the nitrogen-containing functional groups on the surface also increased with the addition of urea, and the surface alkalinity of the material increased. These factors provided channels and activity points for the adsorption of H2S and CH3SH. The surface area and pore size distribution of the adsorbed T(550)U(1.5)t(60)SAC sludge changed significantly, particularly after the micropores disappeared. This indicated that the deodorization reaction mainly occurred in the micropores, and deodorized products such as elemental sulfur and sulfate appeared. The analysis suggested that the (OH)-O-center dot radical on the surface of sludge carbon was the main species for the oxidation of H2S and CH3SH.

TI Nitrogen fertilization induced changes in ammonia oxidation are
   attributable mostly to bacteria rather than archaea in greenhouse-based
   high N input vegetable soil
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Little is known about the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization rates on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) and their differential contribution to ammonia oxidation, particularly in greenhouse based high N input vegetable soils. Potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) of these vegetable soils was evaluated under five levels of N fertilization (with urea) in the presence or absence of the bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors kanamycin and gentamicin. Abundance and community composition of AOB and AOA were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and clone libraries. The five annual N fertilization rates studied were 100% (N870: 300, 270 and 300 kg N ha(-1) for tomato, cucumber and celery, respectively), 80% (N696), 60% (N522), 40% (N348) and 0% (N0) of the conventional N rate. The PAO decreased significantly with increasing N fertilization rates irrespective of the presence of kanamycin plus gentamicin. PAO was significantly lower in the presence than in the absence of kanamycin plus gentamicin, and was decreased by 71.9% under N0, 77.2% under N348, 54.9% under N522, 49.9% under N696, and 51.6% under N870. The abundance of bacterial and archaeal amoA genes was significantly decreased at the highest N fertilization rate. The clone sequences of AOB and AOA were mostly affiliated with the genus Nitrosospira and group 1.1b thaumarchaeota. Changes in community composition were more pronounced in AOB than in AOA after long-term (6-year) N fertilization. Our results suggest that AOB may play a more important role than AOA in NH3 oxidation in such high N input vegetable soils. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, soil samples from the typical rice-wheat cropping system in Jiangsu Province, China, subjected to different fertilizer application treatmentsaEuro center dot no carbon (CK), urea (UR), straw (SR), pig manure (PM), starch (ST), and glucose (GL)aEuro center dot were used to determine potential anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) rate and its association with bacterial abundance, diversity, and activity by using DNA stable isotope probing combined with N-15 isotope tracing and molecular techniques. The effects of different organic carbon sources on anammox were significant, in the following order: GL > ST, SR > UR > PM; anammox activity differed significantly across treatments; however, the C-13 active anammox bacteria were only closely related to Ca. Brocadia. The anammox hydrazine synthase beta subunit functional gene sequences were highly associated with the Candidatus genus Brocadia in PM and CK treatments. The different organic carbon sources had different inhibitory effects with anammox rate, which dropped from 3.19 to 1.04 nmol dinitrogen gas g(-1) dry soil h(-1) among treatments. About 4.2-22.3% of dinitrogen gas emissions were attributed to anammox and indicated that a specific population of anammox bacteria was present and varied with the addition of exogenous organic compounds in paddy soils, although a small part of dinitrogen gas was emitted from the soil via anammox.

TI Boosted urea electrooxidation activity by dynamic steady blending
   CoOOH-Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters for H2 production in a
   pH-asymmetric electrolyzer
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction for reducing the overall potential of the hydrogen evolution reaction during water electrolysis. The theoretical potential for the UOR is only 0.37 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). However, the kinetics of the six-electron transfer process involved in the UOR are inherently sluggish, resulting in high overpotential during the reaction. This study designed an active catalyst with a lower kinetic barrier in the UOR by fabricating blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)(2) nanoclusters through the structural transformation of amorphous Co-Ni hydroxide films. This structural transformation was investigated using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and in situ X-ray absorption spectra. The blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)(2) nanoclusters exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity in the UOR in an alkaline environment, achieving a low onset potential of 1.24 V (vs. RHE) in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. We employed the CoOOH-Ni(OH)(2) nanoclusters as anodic electrocatalysts in a two-cell electrolyzer for asymmetric electrocatalysis. Hydrogen could be produced at a remarkable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low applied potential of only 0.45 V. Density functional theory calculations revealed that blending CoOOH-Ni(OH)(2) nanoclusters with more oxygen vacancies exhibited a lower Gibbs free energy for the intermediate reaction pathway of NCONH2 -> NCONH, compared with the fine structure of CoNiOx (x = 2-3). This study lays down a novel pathway for developing new blending electrocatalysts to be used in electrochemical reactions.

TI Gold particle size effect in biomass-derived lignan hydroxymatairesinol
   oxidation over Au/Al2O3 catalysts
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB The heterogeneously catalyzed aerobic selective oxidation of naturally occurring lignan hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) to another lignan oxomatairesinol (oxoMAT) was carried out at 70 degrees C and atmospheric pressure over gold nanoparticles with different sizes supported on alumina prepared from organometallic precursor by the sal-gel method. Precursor of gold nanoparticles (i.e. gold hydroxide) was supported on alumina by deposition-precipitation with urea from HAuCl4 aqueous solution followed by washing with ammonium hydroxide. The size of the supported gold nanoparticles was changed by either treatment under hydrogen flow at different temperatures or exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at the wavelength of 254 nm. The catalysts were characterized by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis). Structure sensitivity in HMR oxidation was studied showing that the reaction rate passes through a maximum when the gold cluster size is ca. 4 nm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of Modifications for Enhancing the Electrooxidation
   Performance of Porous Ni Foil Catalytic Electrodes Derived from Paper
   Templates: Cu-Added Alloying and In Situ Growth of Ni-S Nanosheets
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Improving the performance of porous nickel-based material used widely in the energy field is necessary. Alloying and increasing the specific surface area are essential approaches. This study used rice paper (Chinese traditional calligraphy and painting paper) as biomass templates to prepare hierarchical porous Ni and Ni-Cu foils (Nip and NiCup) with a thickness of about 60 mu m by impregnating and high-temperature reduction process. The Ni3S2/Nip electrodes were prepared by an in situ-grown Ni3S2 nanosheet array on the struts of Nip via a hydrothermal process. Two modification methods using Cu-added alloying and Ni-S nanosheet growing were compared to determine their effects on the microstructure, phase, and performance in methanol oxidation (MOR) and urea oxidation (UOR). The results showed that both alloying effects and morphology control can promote MOR and UOR. Compared to the current density value of Nip at 0.8 V, the values of the preferred Ni10Cup and nanosheet array Ni3S2/Nip increased by 24.5% and 27.3% for methanol oxidation and by 15.4% and 38.4% for urea oxidation, respectively. Adding Cu helped to improve electron transfer and facilitated the transition from Ni2+ to Ni3+. The large specific surface area of Ni3S2 nanosheets provided more active sites for the reaction. Compared to Ni10Cup, Ni3S2/Nip with a lower impedance value exhibits better electrocatalytic performance and stability, achieving peak current densities of 269.7 mA cm-2 (MOR) and 303.9 mA cm-2 (UOR) at 0.8 V, maintaining 91.2% (MOR) and 102.4% (UOR) of the initial peak current density after 2000 cycles. The foil electrodes obtained under both modification strategies can be used as anode material in portable cells, and might also be applied to the oxidation of other small organic molecules.

TI Interfacing nickel with molybdenum oxides as monolithic catalyst to
   accelerate alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis with robust stability
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Engineering active and robust catalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER and HOR) are of importance for the realization of green hydrogen economy. To make catalysts economically competitive for large-scale applications, even-increasing interests have been shifted to designing nonprecious materials for HER and HOR with active and robust performance. Herein, with the guidance of interface engineering, the monolithic catalyst of Ni-MoO2 heterojunctions on nickel foam (Ni-MoO2/NF) was deliberately fabricated by the in-situ corrosion-growth under hydrothermal condition and following thermal-reduction procedure, which exhibits extraordinary HER and HOR performance, for instance, nearly Pt-like catalytic activities, robust long-term durability even under large current density, and superior Faradaic efficiency in alkaline electrolyte. Coupling with the active urea oxidation catalyst of NiMoO4/NF as anode (treating the hydrothermal product in Ar atmosphere), the assembled overall urea splitting electrolyzer with Ni-MoO2/NF as cathode affords the lower voltage of 1.53 V at 20 mA cm(-2), and keeps this performance overall 120 h without decay. The systematic physicochemical characterization and electrochemical investigations reveal that the heterointerface-induced charge redistribution, individual electrocatalytic functions, superaerophobic/superhydrophilic electrode surface, and monolithic electrode structure together collaborate to the efficient catalytic activity and stability under larger current density.

TI Aspartate-glutamate carrier 2 (citrin): a role in glucose and amino acid
   metabolism in the liver
SO BMB REPORTS
AB Aspartate-glutamate carrier 2 (AGC2, citrin) is a mitochondrial carrier expressed in the liver that transports aspartate from mitochondria into the cytosol in exchange for glutamate. The AGC2 is the main component of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) that ensures indirect transport of NADH produced in the cytosol during glycolysis, lactate oxidation to pyruvate, and ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde into mitochondria. Through MAS, AGC2 is necessary to maintain intracellular redox balance, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Through elevated cytosolic Ca2+ level, the AGC2 is stimulated by catecholamines and glucagon during starvation, exercise, and muscle wasting disorders. In these conditions, AGC2 increases aspartate input to the urea cycle, where aspartate is a source of one of two nitrogen atoms in the urea molecule (the other is ammonia), and a substrate for the synthesis of fumarate that is gradually converted to oxaloacetate, the starting substrate for gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, aspartate is a substrate for the synthesis of asparagine, nucleotides, and proteins. It is concluded that AGC2 plays a fundamental role in the compartmentalization of aspartate and glutamate metabolism and linkage of the reactions of MAS, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, amino acid catabolism, urea cycle, protein synthesis, and cell proliferation. Targeting of AGC genes may represent a new therapeutic strategy to fight cancer.

TI The effect of oxygen vacancies in ZnO at an Au/ZnO interface on its
   catalytic selective oxidation of glycerol
SO JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB In catalytic reactions, the nature of the support has a major effect on the formation of active sites, especially in the case of catalysts with strong metal-support interactions. Two types of ZnO with different concentrations of oxygen vacancies (ZnO-U, produced by a hydrothermal procedure using urea, and ZnO-C, produced by a precipitation method using sodium carbonate) have been prepared and employed as supports for Au catalysts. The results of O1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and positron annihilation spectroscopy showed that ZnO-U has fewer oxygen vacancies than ZnO-C. After the materials were loaded with Au, the formation of an Au/ZnO interface was demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and Au4f X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the formation of the materials involved electron transfer from Au to the ZnO support, resulting in the formation of positively charged Au species. A close correlation between the formation of the interface and the level of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO support was observed: low oxygen-vacancy concentrations result in an increase in the work function of ZnO, which facilitates electron transfer and makes the formation of the Au/ZnO interface more thermodynamically favorable. When they are used as catalysts in glycerol oxidation, the TOF of Au/ZnO-U (1159 h(-1)) was 1.47 times higher than that of Au/ZnO-C (786 h(-1)). The higher activity of Au/ZnO-U can be attributed to the abundance of positively charged Au sites, which strengthen the surface coverage of OH* and then promote H abstraction from an O-H bond in glycerol.

TI Regulating electronic structure by Mn doping for nickel cobalt hydroxide
   nanosheets/carbon nanotube to promote oxygen evolution reaction and
   oxidation of urea and hydrazine
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the direct and efficient means to yield high-purity hydrogen, but it still exists some challenges in addition to the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Constructing highly -efficient electrocatalysts with superior properties plays an essential role in industrial hydrogen production. In this work, a novel electrocatalyst with a distinctive three-dimensional (3D) structure is constructed by inter-twining two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal NiCo hydroxide nanosheets (NiCo HNS) with one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The strategy of elemental doping engineering is employed to further enhance the catalytic performance. The as-fabricated composite of Mn-doped nickel cobalt hydroxide nanosheets intertwined with CNTs (1.5Mn-NiCo HNS/CNT) delivers superior OER electrocatalytic performance, which requires an overpotential of only 239 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH. Compared to NiCo HNS/ CNT, the 1.5Mn-NiCo HNS/CNT electrocatalyst exhibits characteristics of improved electrical conductivity, larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), and faster reaction kinetics due to Mn doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the adsorption of OH- during the first step of OER process was the potential determining step for the Mn substituted Co sites, and the Mn substituted Co sites were the optimum reactive sites that determined the OER performance of the 1.5Mn-NiCo HNS/CNT. Mn doping was proved beneficial to optimize the reaction path and decrease the reaction kinetics energy barrier. The addition of urea or hydrazine into the electrolyte directly decreases the energy consumption and realize their decomposition as pollutants in industrial and agricultural wastewater.

TI Lipase-mediated Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of benzylcyclopentanones in
   ester solvents and deep eutectic solvents
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This work presents the chemo-enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of alpha-benzylcyclopentanones in ester solvents as well as deep eutectic solvents (DES). In the first part of the work the effect of selected reaction conditions on the reaction rate was determined. The oxidation process was most effective in ethyl acetate at 55 degrees C, with the use of lipase B from Candida antarctica immobilized on acrylic resin and UHP as oxidant. Ultimately, these preliminary studies prompted the development of an effective method for the implementation of lipase-mediated Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of benzylcyclopentanones in DES. The highest conversion was indicated when the oxidizing agent was a component of DESs (minimal DESs). The fastest conversion of ketones to lactones was observed in a mixture of choline chloride with urea hydrogen peroxide. In this case, after 3 days, the conversion of the ketones to lactones products exceeded 92% for all substrates. As a result, two new lactones were obtained and fully characterized by spectroscopic data.

TI Electrodeposition of nickel wrinkled nanostructure from choline
   chloride:Urea deep eutectic solvent (reline) and application for
   electroanalysis of simvastatin
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Wrinkled nanostructure of nickel was electrodeposited from a deep eutectic solvent comprising choline chloride and urea (reline) under golvanostatic conditions. Field emission scanning electron microscopic images were taken to evaluate the shape and size of the nickel nanostructure. The nickel nanostructure was then converted into the corresponding oxides, and the kinetics of charge transfer across the interface of the nanostructured oxides/an alkaline electrolyte was then studied. The electron transfer coefficient and apparent rate constant for the Ni-III /Ni-II transition in the alkaline electrolyte were attained as 0.53 and 1.0 s(-1), respectively. The interaction conditions of nickel redox sites on the surface were also discussed. As an application, electrocatalytic oxidation of simvastatin was studied on the nickel wrinkled nanostructure in the alkaline solution. The oxidation process and its kinetics were investigated by cyclic voltanunetry and chronoamperometry. Voltammetric studies indicated that simvastatln was oxidized by Ni-III species via an electrocatalytic mechanism. For the electrooxidation of simvastatin, a rate constant of 3.21 x 10(3) CM3 Mol(-1) S-1 and an electron transfer coefficient of 0.45 were obtained, while simvastatin diffused in the electrolyte with a diffusion coefficient of 1.80 x 10(-6) ere s Finally, simvastatin was determined by the nickel wrinkled nanostructure using an amperometry method with a limit of detection of 4.88 mu mol L-1 and a calibration sensitivity of 0.035 A L mol(-1) cm(-2). The determination method was applied for determination of the drug in tablets.

TI Sodium thiosulfate modified graphitic carbon nitride for enhancing the
   photocatalytic production of aldehydes
SO SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES
AB The oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is one of the most relevant reactions in organic chemistry. The currently implemented methods based on expensive noble metallic catalysts, toxic solvents, and high temperature and pressure conditions have released the seek for softer and cheaper alternatives such as photocatalysis. In this sense, graphitic carbon nitride has been modified with sodium thiosulfate as a source of S and Na+ incorporation in the structure, aimed at enhancing the photocatalytic performance on the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, i.e. cinnamaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and vanillin in aqueous solution. Three g-C3N4 samples synthesized from different precursors, i.e. melamine, thiourea, and urea, were treated with sodium thiosulfate. Urea led to the g-C3N4 with the highest mesoporosity (surface area, 69 m(2) g(-1)) and photocatalytic activity. The modification with 5 % (wt.) of Na2S2O3 enhanced the pseudo-first order rate constant of cinnamyl alcohol oxidation from 0.265 h(-1) (bare sample) to 0.792 h(-1) (Na2S2O3-modified). The characterization of the material suggests a better charge separation of the photogenerated charges after S and Na+ incorporation in the structure, minimizing the recombination rate of photogenerated charges. The optimum photocatalyst, tested in aqueous solution, was most selective in the production of benzaldehyde (selectivity, >100 %) > cinnamaldehyde (>23 %) > vanillin (similar to 5 %). The selectivity was considerably boosted under acetonitrile as the solvent medium, raising in the case of cinnamaldehyde the 23 % recorded in water to 51 % in pure acetonitrile. The degradation mechanism suggests a strong influence of the photogenerated holes and the superoxide radical, the latter being more selective in the oxidation of the alcohol.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Silica gel containing SnCl2-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were synthesized by a sol-gel method using SnCl2-based DESs as the loading component. The n%-SnO2/SiO2 (n = 2, 4, 6) supported catalyst was obtained by calcination of silica gel containing SnCl2-based DESs at high temperature. n%-SnO2/SiO2 was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A catalytic oxidation desulfurization system with 4%-SnO2/SiO2 as the catalyst and H2O2 as the oxidant was applied to remove organic sulfide in model oil. Compared with the traditional impregnation method, the catalyst synthesized using the sol-gel method showed higher oxidative desulfurization activity. The effects of various factors including loading dose of SnO2, temperature, O/S molar ratio, catalyst dosage, and different sulfides on the desulfurization rate were investigated. The experimental results indicate that the desulfurization rate of dibenzothiophene (DBT), 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) and benzothiophene (BT) can reach 99.5%, 81.6% and 22.4%, respectively, under the optimal reaction conditions. The desulfurization activity of 4%-SnO2/SiO2 is above 90% after recycling 5 times.

TI Accelerating charge transfer for Ni(OH)2 through
   chlorine-anion decoration in the urea electrooxidation reaction
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Two-dimensional Ni(OH)(2) is a cheap and promising urea oxidation reaction (UOR) catalyst, but its catalytic performance is seriously hampered by fatal disadvantages including sluggish kinetics, limited exposed active sites in the bulk and unsatisfactory stability. Herein, we report a chlorine-anion modified nickel hydroxide nanosheet (Cl-Ni(OH)(2)) with much better charge transfer, more active centers and improved working stability using an easy-operation method at room temperature. Impressively, the optimal Cl-32-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst delivers a current density of 106.93 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs. RHE and a Tafel slope of 42.37 mV dec(-1), much better than those of pristine Ni(OH)(2) (20.38 mA cm(-2), 100.40 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, Cl-32-Ni(OH)(2) exhibits excellent long-term durability over 15 h under 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides an efficient catalyst for the UOR and affords a simple method to improve the electrocatalytic activity of two-dimensional catalysts for energy conversion.

TI Investigation of emissions from thermal oxidation of waste wood samples
   using spectral methods
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of chemical treatment and heating rate on the emissions released from various waste wood samples including untreated pine and chemically treated MDF, plywood and particleboard after thermal treatment. Emission characteristics of the samples were determined in situ by using their FTIR spectra. Some toxic and carcinogenic gases such as formaldehyde, isocyanate, ammonia and phenyl group were detected in emissions from low temperature combustion of treated samples. For this reason, urea-formaldehyde or melamine formaldehyde treated waste wood samples should be oxidatively pyrolysed at low heating rates and low temperatures to remove nitrogen-containing toxic compounds such as ammonia and isocyanate.

TI A novel lignocellulose pretreatment technology by combining KOH, urea
   peroxide and organosilane to improve glucose yield
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Alkali pretreatments are considered as one of the most popular strategies to pretreat lignocellulose due to its high-efficiency, low-cost, high lignine removing and cellulose content. Nevertheless, glucose concentration ob-tained from lignocellulose by alkali pretrements still can't meet biorefinery requirements. Thus, a novel strategy to pretreat lignocellulose by combining KOH, UHP (urea peroxide) and organosilane (KOH-UHP-Si pretreatment) was proposed. This novel strategy solved two difficult problems that seriously affected the combined pretreat-ment of alkali and advanced oxidant, and then the cellulose relative content and glucose yield were increased by about 2.4 times and 9 times compared with the original straw, about 19% and 20% compared with the alkali (KOH) pretreatment, and about 2.2 times and 3.3 times compared with the advanced oxidation (UHP) pre-treatment. After optimizing the pretreatment process, cellulose relative content in corn straw reached 81.4%, and the removal rates of lignin and hemicellulose were increased to 97.3% and 88.13%, respectively. In addition, we illustrated the mechanism of KOH-UHP-Si pretreatment, in which KOH plays the major role, the organosilane suspension and UHP play the auxiliary role. When the organosilane reduced mass transfer resistance in the re-action system, KOH and UHP assisted and promote each other mutually. Besides, we also illustrated the mechanism of urea assisting KOH removal of lignin through quantum chemical calculations. Moreover, the substances contained in wastewater produced by the novel technique could be turned into agricultural fertilizers after being processed simply, and there will be zero emission in the whole process. Our results indicate that KOH-UHP-Si pretreatment was a high efficiency low cost and eco-friendly strategy for lignocellulose pretreatment.

TI A Mechanistic Approach on Oxygen Vacancy-Engineered CeO2
   Nanosheets Concocts over an Oyster Shell Manifesting Robust
   Photocatalytic Activity toward Water Oxidation
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Lethargic kinetics is the foremost bottleneck of the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. Hence, in this respect, the CeO2 coral reef made up of nanosheets is studied focusing on the oxygen vacancy that affects the water oxidation reaction. First, CeO2 was prepared in an oyster shell/crucible with the presence/absence of urea by a simple calcination technique to tune the oxygen vacancy. More oxygen vacancy was detected in CeO2 prepared from urea and oyster shell, which is evidenced from Raman and PL analyses. Further, the oyster shell-treated sample was found to be of nanosheet type with numerous pores as observed via TEM analysis. The theoretical approach was adopted to expose the role of oxygen vacancies and the fate of scavenging agents in the water oxidation mechanism. It was observed that an oxygen vacancy plays a vital role in minimizing the activation energy hump and opposes the reverse reaction. The apparent conversion efficiency of 7.1% is calculated for the oxygen evolution reaction. Oxygen vacancy, quantum confinement effect, and charge separation efficiency are mainly responsible for the better photocatalyzed water oxidation reaction and hydroxyl radical production. This investigation will help in providing valuable information toward designing cost-effective oxygen vacancy-oriented nanosheet systems and the importance of vacancy in the water-splitting reaction.

TI Effect on nutritional status and biomarkers of inflammation and
   oxidation of an oral nutritional supplement (with or without probiotics)
   in malnourished hemodialysis patients. A multicenter randomized clinical
   trial "Renacare Trial"
SO FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION
AB Background: Malnutrition in patients undergoing hemodialysis is frequent and associated with a reduction in muscular mass and strength, with an increment in biomarkers of inflammation and oxidation.Materials and methods: Randomized, multicenter, parallel-group trial in malnourished hemodialysis patients with three groups [(1) control (C) individualized diet, (2) oral nutritional supplement-ONS- + placebo-SU- PL-, and (3) ONS + probiotics-SU-PR]; the trial was open regarding the intake of ONS or individualized diet recommendations, but double-blind for the intake of probiotics. We obtained, at baseline and after 3 and 6 months, anthropometric measurements, handgrip strength, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), dietary records, and routine biochemical parameters. Inflammation and oxidation were determined using ELISA techniques (Versamax and ProcartaPlex multiplex Immunoassay). Results were analyzed by intention to treat.Results: A total of 31 patients (11 corresponding to group C, 10 to SU-PL, and 10 to SU-PR) completed the 6-months trial. The two groups that took supplements significantly increased their protein calorie, fat (total and n-3), and fiber intake. Weight and fat-free mass (FFM) also increased significantly in the groups on supplements, both at 3 and 6 months, and dynamometry did so in the SU-PL group. At month 3, prealbumin and vitamin D were significantly increased in the SU-TOT (SU-PL + SU-PR) group. No changes were observed regarding levels of phosphorus and potassium in any of the groups. Urea increased significantly at 6 months in the SU-PL group. There were significant changes in some inflammation biomarkers in the groups on supplements during the intervention (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, bone morphogenetic protein-2, MCP-1, IL-1-beta, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-8). The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) increased significantly in the supplemented patients, with no significant changes observed in isoprostanes.Conclusion: The specific ONS improved protein-calorie intake, nutritional status (mainly FFM), and some biomarkers of inflammation/oxidation. The addition of probiotics could have a synergistic effect with ONS in such biomarkers.Clinical trail registration: , identifier NCT03924089.

TI Interfacial sites in platinum-hydroxide-cobalt hybrid nanostructures for
   promoting CO oxidation activity
SO NANOSCALE
AB Metal-oxide/hydroxide hybrid nanostructures provide an excellent platform to study the interfacial effects on tailoring the catalysis of metal catalysts. Herein, a hybrid nanostructure of Pt@Co(OH)(2) supported on SiO2 was synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of Co(OH)(2) with the aid of H2O2 and successive urea-assisted deposition-precipitation of platinum nanoparticles. The Fenton-like reaction between Co-2(+) and H2O2 during the impregnation process facilitates the formation of active interfacial sites. This hybrid nanostructure exhibits much higher catalytic activity towards CO oxidation than Pt/SiO2 nanoparticles with a similar Pt loading and particle size. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy was used to track the CO adsorption processes and to identify the reaction intermediates during CO oxidation. It shows that the OH species at the Pt-OH-Co interfacial sites could readily react with CO adsorbed on neighboring Pt to yield CO2 by forming *COOH intermediates and oxygen vacancies. Under the CO + O-2 oxidation conditions, O-2 molecules are activated by the oxygen vacancy and react with the CO molecules adsorbed on Pt to generate CO2, via forming the highly active *OOH intermediates as observed by DRIFTS.

TI Preparing Pd catalysts based on urea ligand via electrospinning for
   Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions
SO APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling (SMC) reactions are important in chemistry. In this work, using electrospinning technology, we prepared a novel type of composite catalyst with ligand structures such as urea-Pd/PAN (polyacrylonitrile) and used them to catalyze SMC reactions in nontoxic systems and "green" conditions (air atmosphere, low temperature, and short reaction time). This method of preparing hybrid materials is simple and easy to operate. The higher catalytic activity of the catalysts is attributed to active centers with rich electrons transferred from ligands with unique structures, which can decrease the activation energy of the rate-determining step (oxidative addition). In addition, urea-Pd/PAN composite catalysts exhibit higher catalytic performance than those reduced by H(2)because of the smaller size of active species and the more-efficient oxidative addition to Pd-0-ligand complexes compared to Pd-0.

TI Electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution integrated with
   organic oxidation
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Renewable energy-driven hydrogen production from electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting has been widely recognized as a promising approach to utilize green energy resources and hence reduces our dependence on legacy fossil fuels as well as alleviates net carbon dioxide emissions. The realization of large-scale water splitting, however, is mainly impeded by its slow kinetics, particularly because of its sluggish anodic half reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whose product O-2 is ironically not of high value. In fact, the co-production of H-2 and O-2 in conventional water electrolysis may result in the formation of explosive H-2/O-2 gas mixtures due to gas crossover and reactive oxygen species (ROS); both pose safety concerns and shorten the lifetimes of water splitting cells. With these considerations in mind, replacing the OER with thermodynamically more favorable organic oxidation reactions is much more preferred, which will not only substantially reduce the voltage input for H-2 evolution from water and avoid the generation of H-2/O-2 gas mixtures and ROS, but also possibly lead to the co-production of value-added organic products on the anode. Indeed, such an innovative strategy for H2 production integrated with valuable organic oxidation has attracted increasing attention in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. This feature article showcases the most recent examples along this endeavor. As exemplified in the main text, the oxidative transformation of a variety of organic substrates, including alcohols, ammonia, urea, hydrazine, and biomass-derived intermediate chemicals, can be integrated with energy-efficient H2 evolution. We specifically highlight the importance of oxidative biomass valorization coupled with H2 production, as biomass is the only green carbon source whose scale is comparable to fossil fuels. Finally, the remaining challenges and future opportunities are also discussed.

   glycol oxidation
SO SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB A composite of NiCo2O4 modified electrocatalyst is prepared to enhance the ethylene glycol electrooxidation. Chitosan matrix is used to improve the activity and adsorption ability of the surface to enhance ethylene glycol conversion. A Comparative study is investigated between pristine NiCo2O4 and Chitosan-modified spinel oxide to evaluate the synergistic effect between spinel oxide and chitosan. The composite is studied in an alkaline solution using electrochemistry techniques. The electrochemical activity towards ethylene glycol electrooxidation is studied as a function of anodic oxidation current density. Thus, the oxidation current values for NiCo2O4 and NiCo2O4@Chitosan in 1.0 M EG and 1.0 M KOH are 36 and 42 mA cm-2, respectively. The long-term stability of the electrode is measured by constant potential chronoamperometry. Kinetic parameters like diffusion coefficient, Tafel slope, surface coverage, and transfer coefficient are calculated. The density-functional theory estimates the adsorption of small molecules like ethylene glycol, urea, and carbon monoxide. The adsorption energy is studied on the top site of Ni and Co atoms of NiCo2O4. Forcite model is used to study the interaction between spinel oxide and chitosan. The energy calculation assumes that chitosan is adsorbed on the spinel oxide surface and enhances chitosan's ability for the adsorption of small molecules.

TI Selective Oxidations Using a Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Variant Driven with
   Surrogate Oxygen Donors and Light
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes are versatile catalysts, which have been adapted for multiple applications in chemical synthesis. Mutation of a highly conserved active site threonine to a glutamate can convert these enzymes into peroxygenases that utilise hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, we use the T252E-CYP199A4 variant to study peroxide-driven oxidation activity by using H2O2 and urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP). We demonstrate that the T252E variant has a higher stability to H2O2 in the presence of substrate that can undergo carbon-hydrogen abstraction. This peroxygenase variant could efficiently catalyse O-demethylation and an enantioselective epoxidation reaction (94 % ee). Neither the monooxygenase nor peroxygenase pathways of the P450 demonstrated a significant kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the oxidation of deuterated substrates. These new peroxygenase variants offer the possibility of simpler cytochrome P450 systems for selective oxidations. To demonstrate this, a light driven H2O2 generating system was used to support efficient product formation with this peroxygenase enzyme.

TI External and internal dual-controls: Tunable cavity and Ru-O-Co bond
   bridge synergistically accelerate the RuCoCu-MOF/CF nanorods for
   urea-assisted energy-saving hydrogen production
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Currently, there are still many limitations in the research of conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in the field of electrocatalysis. On the one hand, most MOFs have a solid construction, seriously hindering their mass transfer process. On the other hand, innate bonding is not conducive to the optimization of electronic structures and the excitation of intrinsic active sites. Therefore, external/internal dual-control of MOFs is urgently needed to break the shackles of their activity. Herein, the hollow RuCoCu-MOF/CF nanorods with tunable cavities are directionally constructed by a self-sacrificial template method. Benefiting from the exact morphological control and the unique Ru-O-Co bond bridge, RuCoCu-MOF/CF exhibits superior performances for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Surprisingly, a record-breaking voltage of 1.402 V drives a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for urea-assisted overall water splitting under alkaline conditions, greatly promoting the development of energy-efficient hydrogen production technology. This work firstly constructed the MOF-based self-supporting electrode with ultra-high urea-assisted hydrogen production and urea degradation performances via the dual controls of the cavity size and chemical bond bridge.

TI Selective modulation of La-site vacancies in La0.9Ca0.1MnO3 perovskites
   catalysts for toluene Oxidation: The role of oxygen species on the
   catalytic mechanism
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Regulation of A-site vacancies is crucial to the redox reactions on ABO3 perovskites for VOCs catalytic oxidation. Herein, we reported the high toluene removal performance of La-defects and oxygen vacancies based La0.9Ca0.1MnO3 catalyst prepared by pyrolysis with simple urea modification. The 3-La0.9Ca0.1MnO3 had excellent catalytic activity and stability, and had good water resistance under the condition of 3%-10% H2O. Through analysis of various characterization, we found that the modification of urea made the A-site cation of La0.9Ca0.1MnO3 catalyst lack, which could effectively regulate the concentration of adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen in the perovskite catalyst, and enhanced the lattice oxygen participation in the catalytic oxidation of toluene. And the catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies could promote the rapid degradation and complete oxidation of toluene. This study provided a simple method for the effective regulation of the defect site of perovskite catalyst, which was conducive to the promotion of industrial application.

TI Time-Resolved Mechanistic Depiction of Photoinduced CO2
   Reduction Catalysis on a Urea-Modified Iron Porphyrin
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB The development of functional artificial photosynthetic devices relies on the understanding of mechanistic aspects involved in specialized photocatalysts. Modified iron porphyrins have long been explored as efficient catalysts for the light-induced reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards solar fuels. In spite of the advancements in homogeneous catalysis, the development of the next generation of catalysts requires a complete understanding of the fundamental photoinduced processes taking place prior to and after activation of the substrate by the catalyst. In this work, we employ a state-of-the-art nanosecond optical transient absorption spectroscopic setup with a double excitation capability to induce charge accumulation and trigger the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO). Our biomimetic system is composed of a urea-modified iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin (UrFe(III)) catalyst, the prototypical [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy=2,2'-bipyridine) used as a photosensitizer, and sodium ascorbate as an electron donor. Under inert atmosphere, we show that two electrons can be successively accumulated on the catalyst as the fates of the photogenerated UrFe(II) and UrFe(I) reduced species are tracked. In the presence of CO2, the catalytic cycle is kick-started providing further evidence on CO2 activation by the UrFe catalyst in its formal Fe-I oxidation state.

TI Ammonium Chloride vs Urea-Induced Ammonia Inhibition of the Biogas
   Process Assessed by Stable Isotope Analysis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY
AB Anaerobic digestion of poultry manure poses many challenges due to ammonia inhibition by nitrogen-containing compounds. Here, the effect of NH4Cl or urea-induced inhibition was investigated in bioreactors fed with maize silage or cellulose and compared to previous experiments with chicken manure as ammonia source. The hydrogen and carbon stable isotope compositions of biogas samples were evaluated to assess the shifts in predominant methanogenic pathways during increasing ammonia inhibition. Due to the higher free ammonia concentrations, stronger inhibition was observed in the urea added reactors compared to the NH4Cl treated ones. Collectively, the results suggested that ammonium salts are not really appropriate to investigate ammonia inhibition during anaerobic digestion of manure.

TI Construction of desert rose flower-shaped NiFe
   LDH-Ni3S2 heterostructures via seawater
   corrosion engineering for efficient water-urea splitting and seawater
   utilization
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The development of high-performance and robust non-precious metal-based catalysts to accelerate electrocatalytic reaction kinetics is crucial for electrochemical seawater splitting. The common electrocatalysts for seawater electrolysis suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics and instability, restricting their practical application. Herein, nickel-iron layer double hydroxide and Ni3S2 heterostructured nanoflower bifunctional electrocatalysts (NiFe LDH-Ni3S2) were synthesized via seawater corrosion and ion exchange strategy. The desert rose shaped nanoflower structure of the catalyst was tuned by seawater corrosion time. The unique heterostructure not only possessed more redox reaction centers, but also enhanced anti-corrosion ability, which could effectively facilitate mass diffusion, charge transport and maintain high electrocatalytic activity in seawater. The as-prepared NiFe LDH-Ni3S2 electrodes recorded overpotentials as low as 257 and 280 mV to deliver 100 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1 M KOH seawater, respectively. In 1 M KOH seawater + 0.33 M urea, there was an obvious reduced urea oxidation reaction (UOR) potential of 1.37 V to reach 100 mA cm(-2), which is about 140 mV lower than for OER. Noteworthy, Ni/Fe LDH-Ni3S2 as a bifunctional electrocatalyst featured a low voltage of 1.63 V to reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and almost 100% faradaic efficiency for overall water-urea splitting, which is superior to the most previously reported electrocatalysts. This work provides insights on the application of seawater corrosion engineering technique to modulate the electrocatalytic activity in energy conversion and seawater utilization systems, achieving efficient conversion of solar energy, electricity and hydrogen.

TI Highly selective electrocatalytic Cl<SUP>-</SUP> oxidation reaction by
   oxygen-modified cobalt nanoparticles immobilized carbon nanofibers for
   coupling with brine water remediation and H2 production
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Combining the H-2 production with brine remediation is regarded as a sustainable approach to achieving clean H-2 energy. However, designing stable Cl- oxidation reaction (COR) electrocatalyst is the key to realize this route. Herein, a type of oxygen-modified Co nanoparticles anchored graphitic carbon nanofibers catalyst (Co/GCFs) was synthesized through a two-step strategy of adsorption and pyrolysis. The Co/GCFs-2.4 exhibits high selectivity and stability for COR at neutral electrolyte. It is worth noting that unlike the water oxidation, the chemical valence of cobalt has not changed during the COR. Further results demonstrated that the oxygen-modified Co nanoparticles provide active sites for selective COR, meanwhile, the graphitic carbon gives rise to strong catalytic stability. Thanks to the superior COR and H-2 production activity of Co/GCFs-2.4, a two-electrode brine electrocatalysis system employing Co/GCFs-2.4 as both cathode and anode for H-2 production exhibited robust stability, efficient and high Faraday efficiency (98%-100%). We propose that this work provides a novel strategy for designing efficient and stable catalysts with electrocatalytic COR and HER activities at neutral brine water for practically coupling with H-2 production by water electrolysis and brine water remediation.

TI Nickel-constructing interfaces of multiheterostructure on
   self-supporting electrode for efficient overall urea-water splitting
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Water splitting is an environmentally friendly strategy for producing hydrogen but is constrained by the high theoretical potential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. It is possible to save energy by substituting the OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a low theoretical potential. In particular, developing bifunctional catalysts (hydrogen evolution reactions (HER)/UOR) and exploring their catalytic mechanisms and active sites are highly desirable with the rapid development of the hydrogen economy. Herein, the combination of electrodeposition and immersion methods to grow a well-aligned MOF on a graphene-like material (MXene) is reported. Specifically, Ni3S2 species were formed on the hexahedral structure of cobalt based MOF (CoMOF) by electrodeposition. The resultant M/CM/Ni3S2/NF demonstrates good electrocatalytic capabilities toward the HER and UOR, with overpotentials and potentials of 0.174 and 1.392 V required to reach 100 mA cm-2, respectively. DFT results established that the coupling of MXene, CoMOF, and Ni3S2 can optimize the free energy of hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, in situ XRD revealed that the (111), (2 11) and (220) crystal planes resulted in good stability of the material. This work provides an innovative and novel route for designing high-activity bifunctional catalysts for various electrochemical energy applications.

   bond cleavage at room temperature
SO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Ureas and carbamates are common motifs in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, biologically active compounds and organocatalysis applications. Herein, we report a significant advancement in this area and present a general method for copper-catalyzed chemospecific C-C bond cleavage of amides to synthesize urea derivatives and carbamates at room temperature. A catalytic process via a resonant six-membered N,O-chelated copper cycle and superoxide radical was proposed according to mechanistic and control experiments. The combination of chelation assistance and radical oxygenation strategies opened a door for C-C bond cleavage of common substrates which possess multiple reactive sites and we envision that this broadly applicable method will be of great interest in organic synthesis, the pharmaceutical industry and the agrochemical industry.

TI Enhancing the Efficiency of Water Oxidation by Boron-Doped
   BiVO4 under Visible Light: Hole Trapping by BO4
   Tetrahedra
SO CHEMPLUSCHEM
AB Boron-doped monoclinic and tetragonal phases of BiVO4 were prepared by using the urea precipitation method, and the visible-light photocatalytic activities of pristine and boron-doped BiVO4 for oxygen generation from water were compared. Boron doping enhances the photocatalytic activities of BiVO4. The reasons for this enhancement were probed by performing X-ray photoelectron, Raman, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, and also by performing density functional calculations for model boron-doped BiVO4 structures. The photocatalytic activities of BiVO4 is enhanced by boron doping because the resulting BO4 tetrahedra, which are smaller than the VO4 tetrahedra, create an occupied defect level per boron lying approximately 0.17eV above the valence-band maximum of pristine BiVO4, and this defect level is localized because it is made up of the O 2p levels of the BO4 tetrahedron. Thus, the BO4 tetrahedra that result from boron doping act as hole traps, thereby slowing down the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.

TI A systematic comparison of commonly used stoichiometric equations to
   estimate fat oxidation during exercise in athletes
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS
AB BACKGROUND: Over the last half-century, different stoichiometric equations for calculating the energy cost of exercise based upon the combustion of mixtures of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins have been proposed and modified. With the means of indirect calorimetry, while measuring oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, and urinary urea nitrogen excretion, the contribution of specific substrates to overall energy production can be estimated. However, even with their long history of application, no previous studies have evaluated whether the use of different stoichiometric equations provides similar or distinct maximal fat oxidation rate (MFO) responses and information regarding MFO location (FA T-max) in male athletes.
   METHODS: Twenty healthy male athletes performed graded exercise testing (GXT) cycle ergometry using breath by breath gas analysis to assess fat oxidation and maximal oxygen uptake. Analysis of variance followed by within-equation effects, within-equation factors, and post hoc pairwise comparisons were used to examine within-equation differences.
   RESULTS: Compared stoichiometric equations demonstrated significant differences in the mean and maximal fat oxidation rates, varying up to nearly 7%. FA T-max differences, however, were not noticed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that for within-study designs, the equation used appears to be less important, but when inter-study comparisons are planned, caution is in order due to the presence of inter-equation differences.

TI Photocatalytic properties and controlled morphologies of
   TiO2-modified hydroxyapatite synthesized by the urea-assisted
   hydrothermal method
SO POWDER TECHNOLOGY
AB Because hydroxyapatite (HAp) shows the unique adsorption property, we speculate that HAp is a suitable catalyst supports. In this study, TiO2 nanoparticles are dispersed on HAp (TiO2-modified HAp) that was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment using urea. Using add fuchsin (AF), the photocatalytic decolouration and adsorption tests were performed to investigate the effects of HAp characteristics and compositions. The morphology of HAp was changed from needle- to sponge-shaped by increasing the urea concentration. Concurrently, the TiO2 nanoparticle formed on the HAp. The photocatalytic decolouration rate of TiO2-modifed HAp with sponge-shaped crystals, which shows a high surface area and high zeta potential, was slightly higher than the rate in the presence of needle-shaped crystals. Therefore, this study discusses the effects of the HAp morphology and TiO2 nanoparticle count properties that influences adsorption properties. This information can be used to produce more efficient adsorption materials and processes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Experimental Study on the NO Oxidation and Removal by Heterogeneous
   Fenton Reaction
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB For low-temperature flue gas, there is still no efficient and economic denitration technology. The oxidation absorption method can be believed as a new popular choice. Heterogeneous Fenton reaction is a more promising method for the oxidation and removal of NO. Based on a previous study on the absorption of NOx by urea in the tail, the NO oxidation and removal by heterogeneous Fenton reaction was investigated in detail. Experimental results showed that the denitrification efficiency increased with the increase of H2O2 injecting, while the concentration of O-2 have little influence. In order to ensure that the hydrogen peroxide is fully vaporized in the atomization zone, the temperature of the atomization zone should be at 125 degrees C-170 degrees C. Due to the self decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, the temperature in the reaction zone should drop rapidly to below 100 degrees C. Rapid cooling after atomization is the key to improve the denitration efficiency. For the Fenton catalysts, the denitrification efficiency increased with the increase of loading amounts, and the denitrification efficiency can be greatly improved by the doping of Ce. Among the studied catalysts, 15%Fe2O3+15%CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst had the best performance. The experimental study in this paper can commendably promote the follow-up technology development.

TI Synthesis of Dimeric Molecules via Ag-Catalyzed Electrochemical
   Homocoupling of Organic Bromides Paired with Electrooxidation of Urea
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB We present a sacrificial anode-free approach to reductive homocoupling of organohalides that does not require a co-catalyst. In this approach, a divided electrochemical cell with aprotic and aqueous compartments separated by an anion exchange membrane enables coupling of the cathodic homocoupling reaction with anodic oxidation of urea. We show that, in contrast with traditional one-compartment cells relying on sacrificial anodes, the proposed cell configuration maintains stable cell voltage in the course of galvanostatic electrolysis. A synthetic potential of this method was assessed using a series of 13 organic bromides that demonstrated a strong dependence of the reaction outcome on the structure of the organic substrate, more specifically, the dissociation energy of the C-Br bond and the redox properties of formed radicals, which are discussed in detail. While not being suitable for the synthesis of byarylstructures, this method is excellent for C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) coupling to corresponding dimeric products with up to quantitative yields. Simultaneous electrochemical treatment of nitrogenous waste in the adjacent half-cell provides an additional incentive for wide adaptation of this sustainable synthetic approach.

TI Crystalline-to-Amorphous Transformation and Charge Redistribution
   Induced by Anion-Cation Double Substitution on 3D Ni(OH)2
   Ultrathin Nanosheet Arrays Enable Urea-Assisted Energy-Saving Hydrogen
   Production
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Amorphous catalysts possess substantially better catalytic activity toward water splitting than their crystalline counterparts. However, researchers have thus far focused on the crystalline rather than the amorphous phase due to the complexity of synthesis and characterization. Here, crystalline-to-amorphous transformation and charge redistribution induced by Fe and F double substitution on 3D Ni(OH)(2) ultrathin nanosheet arrays are reported as a highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea-assisted water electrolysis. It is unveiled that the synergistic effect of F and Fe dopant incorporation not only alters the electronic configuration for improved intrinsic activity but also creates abundant active sites rich in Ni3+, which are responsible for significantly accelerated reaction kinetics. First, our findings show that the collected F-Fe-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst exhibits excellent urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity with an overpotential of 1.42 V to generate 250 mA cm(-2). Then, the as-prepared catalyst can play a dual role in a whole cell test, presenting a cell voltage of 1.68 V, which is 140 mV lower than that in the overall water-splitting system at 200 mA cm(-2). This work contributes a novel approach to synthesizing Ni-based materials for bifunctional electrocatalysts with enhancement of the catalytic activities of the UOR and the hydrogen evolution reaction.

TI Indirect catalytic oxidation of multi-pollutants in diesel exhaust by
   ozone/micro-nano bubbles system
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Wet oxidation absorption is an efficient and promising method of exhaust gas treatment. When the micro-nano bubbles collapse, they can generate hydroxyl radicals with strong oxidising ability, which can oxidise a variety of pollutants in diesel exhaust. Ozone has strong oxidising properties, and the coupling of ozone and micro-nano bubbles can improve the oxidation and removal effects of polluted gases. In this study, the ozone micro-nano bubbles system was used to oxidise NOx, SO2, and CO to gases that were more readily dissolved in water, such as NO2, SO3, and CO2, and the gases were removed through the absorbent solution. The effects of surfactant, catalyst, urea, pH value, and salinity on the removal efficiency of NOx, SO2, and CO from diesel exhaust were investigated. Through experiments, it was found that the removal efficiency of pollutants was enhanced and then weakened with the increasing concentrations of surfactants, catalysts, and salinity, and continued to decrease with increasing concentrations of urea. When the pH value was < 7, the removal efficiency increased first and then weakened with the increase of the pH value. When the pH value was > 7, it mainly depended on the absorption of acid gas by the alkali solution. Under optimal conditions, the removal efficiencies were 86.3% for NO, 92.1% for SO2, and 65.4% for CO. This study could provide important theoretical support for the industrial application of this technology.

TI Oxidation and cross-linking to improve stability and sizing properties
   of cassava starch with ammonium persulfate-assisted
   hexamethylenetetramine
SO TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB An oxidation cross-linking modified cassava starch (AHS-U) with high-viscosity stability and good film-forming properties was synthesized by oxidation cross-linking reaction, which used ammonium persulfate (APS) as the oxidant, hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as the cross-linking agent and urea as an assistant. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance showed that compared with cassava starch, APS oxidized starch exhibited carboxyl characteristic peaks in its structure, and the hydroxyl proton peak that was connected at the C6 position basically disappeared in the APS-HMT modified cassava starch (AHS). The cross-linking agent HMT released formaldehyde under heating conditions to cross-link oxidized starch. The urea formed hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups in the starch while adsorbing residual formaldehyde, which improved the viscosity stability of the sizing agent. When the APS dosage was 0.4% (the carboxyl content was 0.30%), the HMT dosage was 0.35% (the sedimentation volume was 7.8 mL) and the urea dosage was 2%, the viscosity stability of the AHS-U sizing agent was good under high-temperature conditions (97.12%), and the elongation of the sizing film reached 2.97%. The AHS-U sizing agent can improve the tensile properties and wear resistance of cotton yarn and has a good desizing efficiency. This study overcomes the toxic substance emissions caused by traditional aldehyde cross-linking agents, improves the viscosity stability of the starch sizing agent and provides a new approach to improving the viscosity stability and film-forming properties of starch sizing agents.

TI Constructing CoNi-LDH/Fe MOF/NF Heterostructure Catalyst for
   Energy-Efficient OER and UOR at High Current Density
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) always results in a high overpotential at the anode of water electrolysis and an excessive electric energy consumption, which has been a major obstacle for hydrogen production through water electrolysis. In this study, we present a CoNi-LDH/Fe MOF/NF heterostructure catalyst with nanoneedle array morphology for the OER. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the heterostructure catalyst only required overpotentials of 275 and 305 mV to achieve high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA/cm(2) for OER, respectively. The catalytic activities are much higher than those of the reference single-component CoNi-LDH/NF and Fe MOF/NF catalysts. The improved catalytic performance of the heterostructure catalyst can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of CoNi-LDH and Fe MOF. In particular, when the anodic OER is replaced with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which has a relatively lower thermodynamic equilibrium potential and is expected to reduce the cell voltage, the overpotentials required to achieve the same current densities can be reduced by 80 and 40 mV, respectively. The cell voltage required to drive overall urea splitting (OUS) is only 1.55 V at 100 mA/cm2 in the Pt/C/NF||CoNi-LDH/Fe MOF/NF two-electrode electrolytic cell. This value is 60 mV lower compared with that required for overall water splitting (OWS). Our results indicate that a reasonable construction of a heterostructure catalyst can significantly give rise to higher electrocatalytic performance, and using UOR to replace the anodic OER of the OWS can greatly reduce the electrolytic energy consumption.

TI Iron doped Ni3S2 nanorods directly grown on
   FeNi3 foam as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall
   water splitting
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The development of high-performance and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to replace precious metal catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a thorny issue in the field of electrochemical water splitting. Here, a three-dimensional rods array catalysts of Ni3S2 doped with trace amount of Fe on foam FeNi3 (Fe-Ni3S2@FeNi3) are synthesized. It is found experimentally that Fe-Ni3S2@ FeNi3 has excellent catalytic activity and corrosion resistance in both acidic, neutral and alkaline solutions. In 1.0 M KOH solution, only small overpotentials of 105 mV and 213 mV are required to achieve the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER respectively. In addition, Fe-Ni3S2@FeNi3-8 also exhibits excellent catalytic activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (eta(10) = 48 mV) and 1.0 M PBS solution (eta(10) = 83 mV) for HER. In 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea solution, Fe-Ni3S2@FeNi3-8 requires only 1.40 V to provide the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). As evidenced, doping Fe element into catalyst can significantly increase the catalytic activities for HER and OER. This work demonstrates a new and facile approach to prepare novel bimetallic transition metal catalysts as inexpensive alternatives to precious metal catalysts for efficient hydrogen production.

TI Porous nanosheets of carbon-conjugated graphitic carbon nitride for the
   oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur
SO CARBON
AB Graphitic carbon nitride (CN) has been reported as an emerging non-metallic catalyst for the oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur, but its industrial application is hampered by the unsatisfactory catalytic activity. Herein, we report for the first time a facile bottom-up approach to synthesize porous nanosheets of in-plane carbon-conjugated CN (PCNUC) using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and urea as precursors. The resulted PCNUC catalysts are porous and high in specific surface area because CTAB acts not only as a carbon source for conjugation with CN for the extension of pi-electron system, but also releases gases to function as soft template to create porous CN-based sheets. Thus, the carbon-conjugated CN displays high performance for the catalytic oxidation of H2S to S. Furthermore, the optimized PCNUC catalyst exhibits better durability than the traditional carbon-based and Fe2O3-based catalysts. The results of the present study open up a new avenue for the design of efficient CN-based catalysts for desulfurization reactions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Oxygen vacancies enhance the photocatalytic deep oxidation of NO over an
   N-doped KNbO3 catalyst
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB N-Doped KNbO3 (N-KNbO3) was prepared through mechanical mixing, grinding and calcination of urea and KNbO3. The photocatalytic NO oxidation performance was evaluated at room temperature and under visible light irradiation. Compared with the pristine KNbO3, N-KNbO3 not only has a better NO oxidation performance but also can effectively inhibit the formation of NO2 (electron paramagnetic resonance). EPR tests showed that the doping of non-metallic element N created oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of KNbO3, which was beneficial to the formation of impurity energy levels to reduce the band gap. The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) results indicated that NO acquired electrons around OVs to form N2O2- intermediates, which were then oxidized by reactive oxygen species (OH, O-2(-) and O-1(2)). Moreover, visible light can promote the activation of NO and O-2 and also the formation of OVs. This work provided a new idea for the design and preparation of N-doped photocatalysts for NO photocatalytic oxidation.

TI Identify the Active Phase of Fe-CN Composites for Oxidation Removal of
   Rhodamine B with H2O2
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PHYSIKALISCHE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH
   IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Fe-containing carbon nitrides (Fe-CN) prepared with various CN precursors, including dicyandiamide, melamine, guanidine hydrochloride and urea, were characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, N-2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic emission spectrometer measurements, and used as catalysts to catalyze the rhodamine B oxidation with H2O2 as oxidant. Characteristic results showed that Fe-CN exhibits different compositions, properties and catalytic performances if different CN precursors are used. The Fe-CN prepared from dicyandiamide contains mainly CN phase and certain amounts of surface Fe2O3 phase, exhibits the best activity; while that prepared from urea contains mainly Fe2O3 phase and few amounts of CN phase, exhibits the worst activity. Contrasting experiments conducted under light irradiation, with a supported Fe/CN_D catalyst, and that using a washed catalyst, suggested that the surface Fe2O3 is the active site of the reaction.

   Anchored 2D-Nano-Sandwich Derived from
   Flower-Like-CuFeS2/N-Graphene and
   Cube-Like-NiFeS2/N-CNTs for Water Oxidation and Nitrophenol
   Reduction
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS
AB Surface area, pore properties, synergistic behavior, homogenous dispersion, and interactions between carbon matrix and metal-nanostructures are the key factors for achieving the better performance of carbon-metal based (electro)catalysts. However, the traditional hydro- or solvothermal preparation of (electro)catalysts, particularly, bi- or tri-metallic nanostructures anchored graphene (G) or carbon nanotubes (CNTs), often pose to poor metal-support interaction, low synergism, and patchy dispersion. At first, bimetallic flower-like-CuFeS2/NG and cube-like-NiFeS2/NCNTs nanocomposites were prepared by solvothermal method. The resultant bimetallic nanocomposites were employed to derive the 2D-nano-sandwiched Fe2CuNiS4/NGCNTs-SW (electro)catalyst by a very simple and green urea-mediated "mix-heat" method. The desired physicochemical properties of Fe2CuNiS4/NGCNTs-SW such as multiple active sites, strong metal-support interaction, homogenous dispersion and enhanced surface area were confirmed by various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first urea-mediated "mix-heat" method for preparing 2D-nano-sandwiched carbon-metal-based (electro)catalysts. The Fe2CuNiS4/NGCNTs-SW was found to be highly effective for alkaline-mediated oxygen evolution reaction at low onset potential of 284.24 mV, and the stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH for 10 h. Further, the Fe2CuNiS4/NGCNTs-SW demonstrated excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with good kapp value of 87.71 x 10(-2) s(-1) and excellent reusability over five cycles. Overall, the developed urea-mediated "mix-heat" method is highly efficient for the preparation of metal-nanoarchitectures anchored 2D-nano-sandwiched (electro)catalysts with high synergism, uniform dispersion and excellent metal-support interaction.

TI Mechanism and kinetics of diuron oxidation by hydroxyl radical addition
   reaction
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Diuron is a phenyl urea herbicide used to control weeds in agricultural lands. The degradation of diuron in the atmosphere takes place dominantly via reaction with OH radicals. In this work, the OH addition reaction of diuron has been studied by using density functional theory methods M06-2X,omega B97X-D and MPWB1K with 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The calculated thermochemical parameters show that OH addition reaction occurs favourably at C-2 position of diuron. The rate constant is calculated for the favourable initial reaction pathway by using canonical variational transition state theory with small curvature tunnelling (SCT) correction over the temperature range of 200-1000 K. The reaction of initially formed diuron-OH adduct intermediate with O-2 leads to the formation of peroxy radical intermediate. The reaction of peroxy radical intermediate with HO2 and NOx (x = 1, 2) radicals is studied in detail. The results obtained from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations show that the intermediates and products formed from oxidation of diuron can be easily photolyzed in the sunlight. This study provides thermodynamical and kinetic data for the atmospheric oxidation of diuron by OH radical addition reaction and demonstrates the atmospheric chemistry of diuron and its derivatives.

TI Preparation of Nano-ZnO Powders from Zinc Slag Oxidation Dust Using a
   Deep Eutectic Solvent
SO JOM
AB Herein, a novel solvent-assisted approach is being proposed to recover Zn as nano-ZnO.powders from zinc slag oxidation dust (ZSOD). Choline chloride-urea-butyl alcohol deep eutectic solvent (ChCl-urea-BA DES) was used as an efficient solvent for selective leaching of Zn from the ZSOD, coupled with water precipitation and calcination, to produce highly porous nano-ZnO powders. The ChCl-urea-BA DES exhibits a high selectivity for Zn and Pb from ZSOD, achieving extraction efficiencies of 78.2% and 91.6%, respectively, after leaching at 80 degrees C for 36 h under a liquid/solid ratio of 50 mL g(-1). Afterward, the dissolved Pb was efficiently removed with a residual concentration of 8.6 mg L-1 by cementation with Zn powders at an optimal Zn/Pb2+ molar ratio of 2:1 at 75 degrees C for 2 h. A mixture of ZnO and Zn-4(OH)(6)(CO3)center dot H2O was obtained by adding deionized water to precipitate the purified leaching solvent. The resulting mixtures were then calcined at high temperature to produce nano-ZnO powders, the purity of which was greater than 99.71 wt%. As a novel synthesis method of high value-added functional materials, the ZnO powders exhibited a flower spherical structure packed with ultrathin mesoporous nanosheets, having a thickness of around 10 nm and pore size of 20-40 nm.

Moreover, it has been reported that high-efficiency catalysts are required to implement urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which involves a six-electron reaction, as an electrochemical reaction. We expect that this review can be applied to sustainable and diverse electrochemistry fields.

TI Lipid and Protein Oxidation during in Vitro Gastrointestinal Digestion
   of Pork under Helicobacter pylori Gastritis Conditions
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB Helicobacter pylon gastritis affects gastric pH and concentrations of ascorbic acid, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite, ammonia and urea, pepsin, and mucin. First, the separate effects of each of these altered factors on oxidation of pork were investigated during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Lipid and protein oxidation increased (range 23-48%) in duodenal digests of pork previously exposed to elevated (6.1) versus normal acidic stomach pH (2.3 to 3.5) conditions. Salivary nitrite reduced the formation of lipid and protein oxidation products (range 14-20%) under normal acidic but not elevated stomach pH conditions. Higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide and lower amounts of ascorbic acid decreased concentrations of lipid oxidation products in duodenal pork digests, whereas ammonia slightly stimulated protein oxidation during digestion. Second, two H. pylon gastritis-duodenal digestion models were installed using a set of altered compound concentrations at normal acidic or elevated stomach pH. The elevated pH-gastritis-duodenal digestion model increased pork protein oxidation compared with the normal pH-gastritis and the normal digestion model (14.3 +/- 2.1 vs 8.2 +/- 1.0 nmol DNPH/mg protein, P < 0.001). Compared with the other models, protein oxidation was also increased when nitrite-cured pork was exposed to the elevated pH-gastritis-duodenal digestion model (10.8 +/- 1.4 vs 5.9 +/- 0.8 nmol DNPH/mg protein, P < 0.001), but no significant effect of the model was observed when the pork was seasoned with herbs. Lipid oxidation was not or was marginally affected by the installed model.

TI Activity performance and kinetics for glycerol carbonylation with urea
   over Zn-Co mixed metal oxide catalyst
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Efficient carbonylation of glycerol using urea with Zn-Co mixed metal oxide (MMO) catalyst has been achieved. Various methods of catalyst preparation were explored for glycerol carbonate (GC) synthesis. The optimized method of catalyst preparation was found to be co-precipitation (CP) with a Zn:Co ratio of 70:30, achieving 81% glycerol conversion with 97% GC selectivity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies revealed the formation of ZnO, Co-3 O-4, and spinel ZnCo2O4 phases. Thermal treatment given to the catalyst allows insertion of Zn cations into Co3O4 lattice forming ZnCo2O4 phase which was also evidenced in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. Herein, for the first time, reaction kinetics was studied to propose the rate equation, based on which a plausible reaction pathway is proposed involving two-site adsorption of glycerol (basic site) and urea (acidic site), which undergo carbonylation followed by cyclization into GC. A recycle study and hot filtration test have proven the reusability of the catalyst.

TI From expired metformin drug to nanoporous N-doped-g-C3N4: Durable
   sunlight-responsive photocatalyst for oxidation of furfural to maleic
   acid
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Following the waste management approach and increasing contamination by the pharmaceutical industry, expired metformin drug, a nitrogen-rich organic scaffold, was employed as a nitrogen dopant for the synthesis of valuable N-doped g-C3N4 under very mild conditions. To this end, various amounts of expired metformin drugs were combined with urea, providing N-doped g-C3N4 with a high N/C ratio, confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the presence of the waste doping agent not only resulted in nitrogen-rich graphitic carbon nitride but also elegantly improved its physical and optical properties such as surface area and the rate of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, as well as band gap. The photocatalytic potential of prepared samples was evaluated in the oxidation of furfural under sunlight irradiation. In this line, prepared material containing 1 wt% expired metformin drug, which benefits from high surface area and efficient sepa-ration of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, was a more efficient photocatalyst to deliver the maleic acid product with high selectivity and yield (98% yield) using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent. In addition, the photocatalytic system exhibited high stability and could be reused seven times. The key role of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in the progression of the reaction was established based on control experiments along with proposing the mechanism pathway. Indeed, this study demonstrates a deeper understanding of waste manage-ment concepts in chemical applications, particularly in the synthesis of privileged catalysts using green and sustainable approaches.

TI Carbon-supported vanadium nitride catalyst, prepared from urea-loaded
   MIL-100(V) in the absence of external ammonia flow, having good
   performance in oxidative desulfurization
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Vanadium nitride was firstly applied to oxidative desulfurization (ODS) of liquid fuel. Carbon-supported vana-dium nitride (VN@C) was prepared from pyrolysis of urea-loaded MOF, MIL-100(V), especially in the absence of external ammonia flow. One catalyst prepared at 1100 degrees C, VN@C(1100), had the highest turnover frequency of 18.8 h- 1 (with a very low activation energy of 29.9 kJmol-1) among the reported vanadium-based catalysts. The ESR and scavenger experiments confirmed center dot OH radical was the active species for the ODS. Calculations using density functional theory could support the beneficial role of VN (compared with conventional oxides) both in the adsorption of H2O2 and center dot OH and H2O2 activation to form center dot OH radical. The VN@C(1100) catalyst could be used for five cycles without any loss in activity. Therefore, supported vanadium nitrides could be suggested as a potential catalyst for oxidations that use H2O2 as an oxidant. Moreover, supported vanadium nitrides could be facilely derived from the pyrolysis of urea-loaded V-based MOFs, without ammonia flow.

TI Mechanochemical Approach for the Selective Synthesis of
   1,2-Disubstituted Benzimidazoles and Their Molecular Docking Studies
SO POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDS
AB A greener, scalable and mild mechanochemical protocol has been developed using readily available aromatic aldehydes and o-phenylenediamine in the presence of urea nitrate catalyst to afford 1,2-disubstituted benzimidazoles in few seconds. The highly efficient urea nitrate catalyzed synthesis proceeded via carbonyl activation-cyclization-atmospheric oxidation pathway. The method involved short reaction time (20-30 s), solvent free, easy preparation of catalyst, recyclable catalyst, easy isolation, high yield (92%-99%) at room temperature. Green chemistry matrix of synthesized compounds exhibited low e-factor (0.11), high atom-economy (90.74%), high reaction mass efficiency (89.9%) and excellent eco-score (78.5%). The molecular docking study of all the synthesized compounds for antibacterial and centromere associated protein inhibitor activity gave potential hits via presence of high interaction pattern. Compound 3b (-26.7009 kJ/mol) and 3k (-25.0285 kJ/mol) exhibited highest docking score with the selected 2XCS and 1T5C proteins, respectively.

TI Surface characteristics of phenolic resin coatings
SO SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB Phenolic resins are commonly used as polymer binders for metal, paper and mineral wool substrates. For such applications, mechanical, adhesive and thermal properties are considered most important, and the effect of synthesis and structural parameters on such end-use characteristics are well-documented. However, surface characteristics of cured phenolic resins can be equally relevant and are often overlooked. Widely used resins are phenol-urea-formaldehyde (PUF) and phenol-formaldehyde (PF). It is believed that the inherent chemistry and curing procedure of these resins result in coatings with distinct surface properties and wettability. To gain more insight into surface characteristics such as morphology, chemical composition and wettability of cured PUF and PF resins, different binder formulations were applied on glass substrates and subsequently characterised by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Contact Angle Goniometry (CAG) and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of catalyst, chemical composition and curing conditions on surface characteristics of various PUF and PF coatings were investigated. The curing temperature was found to have a strong influence on surface properties; curing at 200 C yields a surface with varying degrees of oxidation, differences in linkages between phenolic and urea species, and a lower overall nitrogen content in case of urea-containing coatings, resulting in stronger fluctuations in water-wettability compared to surfaces hardened at lower temperatures.

TI Lipase-Catalyzed Oxidation of Cyclohexanone To Form ε-Caprolactone and
   Kinetic Modeling
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB The chemoenzymatic conversion of cyclohexanone to epsilon-caprolactone (1.25 M) mediated by immobilized lipase from T. laibacchi was successfully achieved with a yield of 98.6%, which is much higher than that in previous studies. A proposed kinetic model consisting of two enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the lipase and one chemical reaction was developed, which fitted the experimental data very well. It was concluded that the enzymatic oxidation of ethyl acetate using urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) to generate in situ peracetic acid mediated by the lipase may follow an irreversible ping-pong three-four mechanism with substrate inhibitions, which is proposed herein for the first time. Also, the oxidation of cyclohexanone to epsilon-caprolactone by peracetic acid in a chemical fashion may follow a power law. Finally, the reaction of formed acetic acid with UHP to form peracetic acid catalyzed by the lipase may follow an irreversible ping-pong Bi-Bi mechanism with substrate inhibitions. Reaction kinetic data reveal that UHP and acetic acid might have strong substrate inhibition, while peracetic acid might have no product inhibition. Results of enzyme stability test suggest that it is reasonable to adopt a simple exponential equation as the inactivation model of the lipase. The effect of Michaelis-Menten interaction on the reaction rate could be neglected due to the strong substrate inhibition, which makes the constant similar to Michaelis-Menten zero. The yield of in situ polymerization was significantly increased from 61.3% to 92.4% under the optimum conditions obtained in this study.

TI Precise carbon doping regulation of porous graphitic carbon nitride
   nanosheets enables elevated photocatalytic oxidation performance towards
   emerging organic pollutants
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB To improve the photocatalytic oxidation performance of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) towards organic pollutants, the present work develops a homogeneous carbon atom-self doping strategy to prepare porous carbon-rich g-C3N4 nanosheets (HCN-C-x). The preparation process of HCN-C-x includes preorganization of Lcysteine and urea under hydrothermal environment followed by thermal copolymerization, and carbon doping level can be precisely adjusted by changing initial urea/L-cysteine molar ratio from 5000, 1667, 1000 to 500. The characteristic results combined with theory calculations confirm that -C--C-C skeleton from L-cysteine are introduced into the heptazine framework of g-C3N4 by the replacement of some -C--N-C units; additionally, the introduction of -C--C-C skeleton can generate defect-induced midgap states in the band structure of gC(3)N4. The HCN-C-x nanosheets exhibit carbon doping level-dependent and notably elevated photocatalytic oxidation activity to three emerging organic pollutants including acetaminophen (APAP), levofloxacin (LEV) and methylparaben (MPB), in which the HCN-C0.5 performs the best. After visible-light irradiation of the HCN-C0.5 for 10, 8 and 90 min, the removal efficiency of APAP, LEV and MPB reaches up to nearly 100%. The excellent photocatalytic oxidation performance of HCN-C-x is dominated by carbon atom-self doping, which can not only enhance the visible-light harvesting efficiency but also boost photoexcited charge carrier transfer dynamics. Consequently, abundant reactive oxygen species including & BULL;O-2(-), O-1(2) and & BULL;OH are generated, and they are responsible for the elevated photocatalytic oxidation performance of HCN-C-x.

TI Recent advances in paired electrolysis coupling CO2 reduction with
   alternative oxidation reactions
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds great promise in green energy conversion and stor -age. However, for current CO2 electrolyzers that rely on the oxygen evolution reaction, a large portion of the input energy is "wasted" at the anode due to the high overpotential requirement and the recovery of low-value oxygen. To make efficient use of the electricity during electrolysis, coupling CO2RR with anodic alternatives that have low energy demands and/or profitable returns with high-value products is then promising. Herein, we review the latest advances in paired systems for simultaneous CO2 reduction and anode valorization. We start with the cases integrating CO2RR with concurrent alternative oxidation, such as inorganic oxidation using chloride, sulfide, ammonia and urea, and organic oxidation using alco-hols, aldehydes and primary amines. The paired systems that couple CO2RR with on-site oxidative upgrading of CO2-reduced chemicals are also introduced. The coupling mechanism, electrochemical per-formance and economic viability of these co-electrolysis systems are discussed. Thereby, we then point out the mismatch issues between the cathodic and anodic reactions regrading catalyst ability, electrolyte solution and reactant supply that will challenge the applications of these paired electrolysis systems. Opportunities to address these issues are further proposed, providing some guidance for future research.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI Green tea polyphenols boost gut-microbiota-dependent mitochondrial TCA
   and urea cycles in Sprague-Dawley rats
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Green tea polyphenols (GTPs) were found to boost mammal energy conversion by modulating gut-microbial community structure, gene orthologs and metabolic pathways. Here we examined the metabolites present in the gut-microbiota-dependent mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and urea cycle using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-heated electrospray ionization (HESI)-tandem liquid chromatogram mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Six groups (n=12) of Sprague-Dawley rats (6-mo, similar to 250 g) were administered with water containing 0%, 0.5%, and 1.5% GTPs (wt/vol or g/dL). Gut-content samples were collected at 3- and 6-mo. Untargeted metabolomics detected 2177 features, with 91 features demonstrating significant dose- and time-dependencies on the GTPs treatment. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed remarkable changes of 39 metabolites in the mitochondria! TCA cycle and urea cycle, including argininosuccunic acid (0.9-fold vs control), dihydrouracil (1.14-fold vs control), fumaric acid (1.19-fold vs control), malic acid (2.17-fold vs control), citrulline (1.86-fold vs control), and succinic acid (0.4-fold vs control). The untargeted metabolomics data were mined using bioinformatics approaches, such as analysis of variance-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA), enrichment pathway analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway mapping analysis. The results of 16S rRNA survey, metagenornics analysis, and metabolomics analysis were extrapolated and integrated using databases of Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) and KEGG. Our analysis demonstrates that GTPs enhance energy conversion by boosting mitochondrial TCA cycle and urea cycle of gut-microbiota in rats. This metabolic modulation is achieved by enriching many gene orthologs, following the increase of beneficial microbials in families C. Ruminococcaceae, C. Lachnospiraceae and B. Bacteroidaceae.

TI Disinfection of urine by conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB This work focuses on the application of electrolysis with diamond anodes for the disinfection of urine. To do this, a synthetic human urine was polluted with Escherichia ca. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and then, it was electrolyzed at current densities within the range 0-100 A m(-2). Results show that it is possible to disinfect completely the effluent even at applied electric charges lower than 2 kAh m(-3), regardless the current density applied. This good performance is related to the production of powerful oxidants from the oxidation of the ions present in synthetic urine. Likewise, these species also react with the organics contained in urine (urea, creatinine and uric acid), favoring their degradation. The process efficiency for both microorganisms and organics is higher when working at low current densities. The removal of organics leads to the release of significant amounts of nitrogen in the form of nitrate which are later electroreduced to ammonium, that, in turn, reacts with the electrogenerated hypochlorite, favoring the production of chloramines (which can also contribute to the disinfection process). Regarding the mineralization, TOC removal higher than 90% can be achieved but higher applied electric charges than those required for disinfection have to be applied (around 30 kAh m(-3)).

TI Comparison study of preferential oxidation of CO over nanocrystalline
   Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by different preparation
   methods
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in presence of excess hydrogen is a promising alternative to restrict the CO deposition in the Pt-anode in the practical polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell application. In the present work, nanocrystalline copper- ceria catalysts have been synthesized by hydrothermal method, wet impregnation method and urea nitrate combustion method. Their characterizations have been carried out by using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X. ray photoelectron spectroscopy-It has been found that Cu2+ replaced Ce4+ in cerium oxide, creating oxygen vacancy. The formation of more nano-sized CeO2 leads to more oxygen vacancies in CeO2 through the formation of interfacial Cu1+ ions, which also enhances the CO oxidation activity. Among the synthesized Cu-CeO2 catalysts, the catalyst prepared by hydrothermal method have shown both CO conversion andC O-2 selectivity as 100% towards CO oxidation at 373 K in the presence of excess H-2 making this catalyst viable for practical fuel cell application..

TI CO oxidation activity enhancement of
   Ce0.95Cu0.05O2-δ induced by Pd
   co-substitution
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A bimetallic, ionic, Ce0.93Pd0.02Cu0.05O2-delta catalyst was synthesized in one step using a urea-assisted solution combustion method. The structural and electronic properties of the catalyst were studied by different techniques together with those of mono-metallic analogues. The catalytic performance of the materials was investigated using CO oxidation as the model exhaust reaction and the nature of the active sites was examined by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, XPS, XANES, EXAFS and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) revealed that the prepared materials are single-phase, solid-solution oxides with a fluorite structure. In situ XRD studies showed that the prepared materials are metastable up to 1100 degrees C. The correlation of the characterization and catalytic results indicates that catalytic performance is influenced by the presence of oxygen vacancies and the existence of synergism between Pd2+, Cu2+ and cerium ions. DRIFTS results revealed that CO interacts with the active centres already at room temperature, forming Cu+ and Pd2+ carbonyls.

TI Non-enzymatic disposable electrochemical sensors based on
   CuO/Co3O4@MWCNTs nanocomposite modified
   screen-printed electrode for the direct determination of urea
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A new electrochemical impedimetric sensor for direct detection of urea was designed and fabricated using nanostructured screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) modified with CuO/Co3O4 @MWCNTs. A facile and simple hydrothermal method was achieved for the chemical synthesis of the CuO/Co3O4 nanocomposite followed by the integration of MWCNTs to be the final platform of the urea sensor. A full physical and chemical characterization for the prepared nanomaterials were performed including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to study the electrochemical properties the modified electrodes with the nanomaterials at different composition ratios of the CuO/Co3O4 or MWCNTs. The impedimetric measurements were optimized to reach a picomolar sensitivity and high selectivity for urea detection. From the calibration curve, the linear concentration range of 10(-12)-10(-2) M was obtained with the regression coefficient (R-2) of 0.9961 and lower detection limit of 0.223 pM (S/N = 5). The proposed sensor has been used for urea analysis in real samples. Thus, the newly developed non-enzymatic sensor represents a considerable advancement in the field for urea detection, owing to the simplicity, portability, and low cost-sensor fabrication.

TI Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Activity of Ammonium Nickel Phosphate,
   [NH4]NiPO4•6H2O, and β-Nickel
   Pyrophosphate, β-Ni2P2O7: Catalysts for
   Electrocatalytic Decomposition of Urea
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Electrocatalytic decomposition of urea for the production of hydrogen, H-2, for clean energy applications, such as in fuel cells, has several potential advantages such as reducing carbon emissions in the energy sector and environmental applications to remove urea from animal and human waste facilities. The study and development of new catalyst materials containing nickel metal, the active site for urea decomposition, is a critical aspect of research in inorganic and materials chemistry. We report the synthesis and application of [NH4]NiPO4 center dot 6H(2)O and beta-Ni2P2O7 using in situ prepared [NH4](2)HPO4. The [NH4]NiPO4 center dot 6H(2)O is calcined at varying temperatures and tested for electrocatalytic decomposition of urea. Our results indicate that [NH4]NiPO4.6H(2)O calcined at 300 degrees C with an amorphous crystal structure and, for the first time applied for urea electrocatalytic decomposition, had the greatest reported electroactive surface area (ESA) of 142 cm(2)/mg and an onset potential of 0.33 V (SCE) and was stable over a 24-h test period.

TI The bakery of high-end sorption carbons: sugar-urea doughs as
   processable precursors for functional carbons
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Via utilizing a phenomenon that is usually observed in the food industry, a scalable, safe, and cheap synthesis method for processable and functional porous carbons has been presented. Using simple sugars in combination with urea, low melting liquids can be formed that are also stable at room temperature without recrystallization. Due to low vapor pressure, these melts can be easily stored and handled for further use as carbon precursors. The resulting carbon materials possess high nitrogen content and are obtained in high yield. The liquid precursor state also allows the addition of further substances, and highly porous carbon monoliths can be formed by the introduction of a salt/fiber mixture. Herein, cellulose was found to serve as an efficient additive, which resulted in processable viscoelastic doughs without the alteration of the final carbon properties. This method is of special importance with regard to industrial processes as compared to standard carbonization, and it becomes possible to handle intermediates in a green body fashion. Eventually, compared to pre-baked bread rolls, storable intermediates can be processed which inherently contain already all the final carbon properties. The carbon cookies were stable against oxidation and were shown to be highly suitable as a sorption material, which was demonstrated via dye-removal from an aqueous solution.

TI Enhanced urea oxidization electrocatalysis on spinel cobalt oxide
   nanowires via on-site electrochemical defect engineering
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Urea electrolysis provides a promising approach for simultaneous energy-saving hydrogen production and wastewater utilization; however, the total reaction rate is severely restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic urea oxidization reaction (UOR). Herein, we report a universal and highly controllable electrochemical defect-engineering approach to enrich the active sites on transition metal oxides toward promoted UOR catalysis. A large number of oxygen vacancies (V-o) were introduced on the surface of a Co3O4 nanowire model-material through negative potential tuning, leading to significantly increased UOR activity of the material. At a potential of 1.34 V vs. RHE, the defect-engineered catalyst delivers an optimal UOR current density of 100 mA cm(-2), which is much higher than that (42 mA cm(-2)) offered by the original Co3O4 catalyst, and outperforms the best reported noble-metal-free UOR catalysts. Experimental results further reveal that the formation of V-o can effectively reduce the charge transport/transfer resistances both inside the nanowires and at the catalyst/electrolyte interface, giving rise to improved UOR activity. These findings suggest the great potential of this electrochemical defect-engineering strategy in the design of defect-enriched catalysts for advanced electrocatalysis.

TI Photocatalytic Oxidation of Printing and Dyeing Wastewater by Foam
   Ceramics Loaded with Cu and N-TiO2
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB Copper (Cu) and nitrogen (N) co-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) loaded catalysts were synthesized through the sol-gel process. Butyl titanate was used as the precursor, while urea and blue vitriol served as the N and Cu sources, respectively. These materials were applied to foam ceramics using the dip-coating method, which was followed by a photocatalytic oxidation test was carried out using an RhB solution to simulated dye wastewater. The catalysts were characterized via scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry. The results revealed that the modified TiO2 was well dispersed on the foam ceramic surface, with all nanoparticles exhibiting an anatase phase structure. Additionally, the visible light responsiveness of the TiO2 was optimal. The study further investigated the effects of Cu and N-TiO2 catalysts on the photocatalytic oxidation of dyeing wastewater under UV light.

TI The Tanning Performance of Dialdehyde Cellulose Prepared by
   Electrochemical Oxidation System
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF LEATHER TECHNOLOGISTS AND CHEMISTS
AB The aim of this study was to develop a new dialdehyde cellulose tanning agent and discuss its tanning performance. Firstly, cellulose was dissolved with sodium hydroxide and urea. Secondly, dialdehyde cellulose was prepared by an electrochemical oxidation system. The obtained dialdehyde cellulose contained 68.48% aldehyde groups. The reaction between dialdehyde cellulose and gelatin has been verified by the determination by Fourier transformed infrared testing.
   When pickled goatskin was tanned with dialdehyde cellulose, the optimal conditions were, dosage of dialdehyde cellulose 25%, initial pH4.5, tanning temperature 35 degrees C. The tanned goat garment crust leather had a shrinkage temperature 82.2 degrees C, tensile strength 28.23MPa, elongation at break 48.35%, all of which meet the standard for goat garment leather. After ageing for 20 days, all characteristics remained stable indicating that dialdehyde cellulose is a feasible and eco-friendly tanning agent.

TI Concave Cubic Pt-Sm Alloy Nanocrystals with High-Index Facets and

AB Concave cubic Pt(90)Sm(10 )alloy nanocrystals (NCs) enclosed by high-index {310} facets were constructed by a facile electrochemical method in a choline chloride-urea (ChCl-U)-based deep eutectic solvent (DES). It was demonstrated that the concave cubic Pt90Sm10 alloy NCs with high-index {310} facets exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity and stability toward ethanol electrooxidation than those of pure concave cubic Pt NCs and commercial Pt/C catalysts because of the synergy of steric and electronic effects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that Sm alloyed Pt{310} can significantly decrease the overall ethanol oxidation reaction barriers.

TI Hollow Mo/MoSVn Nanoreactors with Tunable Built-in Electric
   Fields for Sustainable Hydrogen Production
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Constructing built-in electric field (BIEF) in heterojunction catalyst is an effective way to optimize adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, while its precise tailor to achieve efficient bifunctional electrocatalysis remains great challenge. Herein, the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors with tunable BIEFs are elaborately prepared to simultaneously promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for sustainable hydrogen production. The BIEF induced by sulfur vacancies can be modulated from 0.79 to 0.57 to 0.42 mV nm-1, and exhibits a parabola-shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities, the Mo/MoSV1 nanoreactor with moderate BIEF presents the best bifunctional activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that the moderate BIEF can evidently facilitate the hydrogen adsorption/desorption in the HER and the breakage of N & horbar;H bond in the UOR. The electrolyzer assembled with Mo/MoSV1 delivers a cell voltage of 1.49 V at 100 mA cm-2, which is 437 mV lower than that of traditional water electrolysis, and also presents excellent durability at 200 mA cm-2 for 200 h. Life cycle assessment indicates the HER||UOR system possesses notable superiority across various environment impact and energy consumption. This work can provide theoretical and experimental direction on the rational design of advanced materials for energy-saving and eco-friendly hydrogen production.

TI Electrochemical degradation of acetaminophen in urine matrices:
   Unraveling complexity and implications for realistic treatment
   strategies
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Urine has an intricate composition with high concentrations of organic compounds like urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Urine poses a formidable challenge for advanced effluent treatment processes following urine diversion strategies. Urine matrix complexity is heightened when dealing with pharmaceutical residues like acetaminophen (ACT) and metabolized pharmaceuticals. This work explores ACT degradation in synthetic, fresh real, and hydrolyzed real urines using electrochemical oxidation with a dimensional stable anode (DSA). Analyzing drug concentration (2.5 - 40 mg L-1) over 180 min at various current densities in fresh synthetic effluent revealed a noteworthy 75% removal at 48 mA cm-2. ACT degradation kinetics and that of the other organic components followed a pseudo-first-order reaction. Uric acid degradation competed with ACT degradation, whereas urea and creatinine possessed higher oxidation resistance. Fresh real urine presented the most challenging scenario for the electrochemical process. Whereas, hydrolyzed real urine achieved higher ACT removal than fresh synthetic urine. Carboxylic acids like acetic, tartaric, maleic, and oxalic were detected as main by-products. Inorganic ionic species nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium ions were released to the medium from N-containing organic compounds. These findings underscore the importance of considering urine composition complexities and provide significant advancements in strategies for efficiently addressing trace pharmaceutical contamination.

TI Nitrapyrin effectiveness in reducing nitrous oxide emissions decreases
   at low doses of urea in an Andosol
SO PEDOSPHERE
AB In the tropics, frequent nitrogen (N) fertilization of grazing areas can potentially increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The application of nitrification inhibitors has been reported as an effective management practice for potentially reducing N loss from the soil-plant system and improving N use efficiency (NUE). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the co-application of nitrapyrin (a nitrification inhibitor, NI) and urea in a tropical Andosol on the behavior of N and the emissions of N2O from autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrification. A greenhouse experiment was performed using a soil (pH 5.9, organic matter content 78 g kg(-1), and N 5.6 g kg(-1)) sown with Cynodon nlemfuensis at 60% water-filled pore space to quantify total N2O emissions, N2O derived from fertilizer, soil ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-), and NUE. The study included treatments that received deionized water only (control, CK) and two doses of N-15-enriched urea (65 (UR) and 129 mg N kg(-1) (UD)) without or with 350 g nitrapyrin for each 100 kg N (UR + NI and UD + NI). No significant differences were observed in soil NH4+ content between the UR and UR + NI treatments, probably because of soil mineralization and immobilization (influenced by high soil organic matter content). Nitrapyrin application failed to maintain a stable pool of labeled NO3 due to the additional NO3 produced by heterotrophic nitrification, which is not effectively inhibited by nitrapyrin. After 56 d, N2O emissions in UR (0.51 +/- 0.12 mg N2O-N kg(-1)) and UR + NI (0.45 +/- 0.13 mg N2O-N kg(-1)) were not significantly different; by contrast, emissions were 36.3% lower in UD + NI than in UD. It was concluded that the soil organic N mineralization and heterotrophic nitrification are the main processes of NH4+ and NO3 production. Additionally, it was found that N2O emissions were partially a consequence of the direct oxidation of the soil's organic N via heterotrophic nitrification coupled to denitrification. Finally, the results suggest that nitrapyrin would likely exert significant mitigation on N2O emissions only if a substantial N surplus exists in soils with high organic matter content.

TI Investigations of coal beneficiation by using choline chloride and
   urea-based deep eutectic solvent
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL PREPARATION AND UTILIZATION
AB The present study reports on the interaction, influence, and dissolution properties of coal samples (CS) by a green solvent, deep eutectic solvent (DES), prepared from choline chloride and urea. The bituminous coal has been collected from the Singrauli coalfield in India. DES was synthesized using urea as a hydrogen bond acceptor (HA) and choline chloride as a hydrogen bond donor (HD) in an equimolar amount. The synthesized DES has been used in the study for swelling behavior, proximate and ultimate analysis, and FTIR to understand the beneficiation of coal after DES treatment. The swelling index of DES-treated coal ranges from 1.12 to 1.43 when compared to raw CS. FTIR confirms the presence of different oxygen-containing phenolic, aromatic, and aliphatic hydrocarbon containing functional groups present in coal samples. Quantitative analysis of FTIR peaks was carried out through the Gaussian function peak processing method. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of the raw coal and treated sample confirms the reduction of oxygen-carrying and phenolic vibrational groups by up to 86%. The ultimate and proximate analysis of raw coal and DES-treated CS shows the decrease in ash content (up to 26%) of DES-treated coal samples and confirms the FTIR results. Calorific value in the form of fixed carbon content was also increased by up to 4.7% after DES treatment. Hence, DES treatment efficiently benefits coal properties and makes them more useful for the industrial environment.

TI Lactonization reactions through hydrolase-catalyzed peracid formation.
   Use of lipases for chemoenzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidations of
   cyclobutanones
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS B-ENZYMATIC
AB A one-pot chemoenzymatic method has been described for the synthesis of gamma-butyrolactones starting from the corresponding ketones through a Baeyer-Villiger reaction. The approach is based on a lipase-catalyzed perhydrolysis for the formation of peracetic acid, which is the responsible for the ketone oxidation. Optimization studies have been performed in the oxidation of cyclobutanone, finding Candida antarctica lipase type B, ethyl acetate and urea-hydrogen peroxide complex as the best system. The relative ratio of these reagents has also been analyzed in depth. This synthetic approach has been successfully extended to a family of 3-substituted cyclobutanones in high substrate concentration, yielding the corresponding lactones with excellent isolated yields and purities, under mild reaction conditions and after a simple extraction protocol.

TI Cobalt-incorporated, nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers as effective
   non-precious catalyst for methanol electrooxidation in alkaline medium
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Among the nanosupports, carbon nanofibers distinctly enhance the performance of the functional electrocatalysts because the adsorption capacity and low resistance electron transfer due to the large axial ratio. Moreover, nitrogen doping shows positive influence toward electrooxidation ability. In this study, Co-incorporated and nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers are introduced as effective non-precious electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation in the alkaline medium. The introduced NFs have been prepared using facile, simple, high yield, low cost, and effective technique; electrospinning. Typically, calcination of cobalt acetate/urea/poly(vinyl alcohol) electrospun mats at 850 degrees C in argon atmosphere leads to produce the introduced nanofibers. The structure, composition and morphology were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, EDX, FE-SEM and TEM techniques. The electrocatalytic activity of the introduced nanofibers toward methanol oxidation was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Study the influence of the nitrogen content could be investigated by adjusting the urea content in the original electrospun nanofiber mats. The results indicated that the activity of the catalyst increases with increasing urea content in the electrospun solution up to 4%. A maximum current density was 100.84 mA cm(-2) for Co/N(4%)-CNFs that was higher than the undoped ones (63.56 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, good chemical stability was observed due to covering the metals NPs by carbon shells. Overall, nitrogen doping enhances electrocatalytic activity of Co/CNFs toward methanol oxidation in alkaline media. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI High-Temperature Corrosion of Stainless Steels and Ni Alloys During
   Combustion of Urea-Ammonium Nitrate (UAN) Fuel
SO OXIDATION OF METALS
AB This paper reports on corrosion behavior of different materials under combustion of a nitrogen-based fuel: aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate and urea (UAN). Tested materials include stainless steels 316, 310 and nickel alloys: 600, 601, 617, 800H and RA333. The results were derived under conditions close to those in practical continuous combustion applications. The coupons were positioned in quartz cylinders at temperature 520 +/- 10 A degrees C and pressure 10 MPa in the effluent gases. The corrosion of the 316 SS fuel injection tube was tested as a function of the stages that occurred along the tube, namely: heating, ignition, and combustion. Microstructure, chemical composition, depth profile and thickness of the formed oxide scales were studied. High corrosion resistance was found for 310 SS, nickel alloys 601 and RA 333. The heaviest corrosion attack of 316 inlet tube (both general and intergranular) was observed in the area where the exothermic combustion process began.

TI Effect of urea on the morphology and room temperature ferromagnetism of
   CeO2 microstructures synthesized by hydrothermal method
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB CeO2 microstructures with different morphologies were successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method using Ce(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O as the cerium source, urea as precipitator and carbon source, and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as surfactant. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the synthesized CeO2 have the fluorite structure. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated that the synthesized CeO2 have cometary shape microstructures. The estimated direct band gaps (E (g) ) of CeO2 are 0.08-0.15 eV smaller than that of bulk CeO2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that there are plenty of Ce3+ ions and oxygen vacancies at surface of CeO2. The emission intensity decreases with the increase of urea from 10 to 40 mmol. All the synthesized CeO2 exhibited the room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM), and saturation magnetization (M (s) ) increases with the increase of E (g) up to 3.06 eV and then decreases with E (g) increasing more. The RTFM mechanism of cometary shape CeO2 has been proposed which is mainly associated with the oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ ions.

TI Key properties of mixed cerium and zirconium microspheres prepared by
   the internal gelation process with previously boiled HMTA and urea
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB The internal gelation process using previously boiled hexamethylenetetramine-urea was used in exploratory study to produce CeO2-ZrO2 microspheres, which can serve as a simulant for ceramic transuranic fuel particles and as a viable three-way catalyst. The calcined CeO2 and ZrO2 microspheres with Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size and volumes of 8-10 nm and 0.19-0.20 mL/g, respectively, had many more surface cracks than their relatively smooth CeO2-ZrO2 counterparts even though the BJH pore sizes and volumes of mixed oxide spheres were lower at 3 nm and 0.11-0.12 mL/g, respectively. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas for the CeO2 and ZrO2 microspheres were 74 and 93 m2/g, respectively, and the BET surface areas for the mixed oxides were much greater at 155-158 m2/g, which should improve catalytic performance. The catalytic activity of each microsphere composition was confirmed through the oxidation of carbon monoxide.

TI Sulfur dioxide-tolerant strontium chromate for the catalytic oxidation
   of diesel particulate matter
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A sulfur dioxide (SO2)-tolerant, stable mixed oxide as an alternative to platinum (Pt) group metal (PGM) catalysts has been explored for the catalytic oxidation of particulate matter (PM) due to its low-cost, desirable physiochemical properties, thermal stability, tailoring options, etc. Herein, a mixed oxide of Sr and Cr was prepared via a solution combustion method by mixing stoichiometric amounts of Sr- and Cr-precursors with citric acid and urea as fuels followed by calcination at 800 degrees C in air. A pure mixed oxide phase of Sr and Cr (SrCrO4) (P2(1)/n [14]) (a = 0.7090 nm, b = 0.7394 nm, and c = 0.6755 nm) has been successfully prepared, and the SrCrO4 particles are larger in size with semi-oval shapes due to their agglomeration at elevated temperatures. The SrCrO4 catalyst shows significantly improved intrinsic catalytic performance for PM oxidation in the tested temperature range as compared to the reference catalysts, Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-dispersed SrCrO4 (Pt/SrCrO4) (loading weight: 5 wt%) are used as internal reference catalysts. The onset temperature (i.e., intrinsic catalytic activity at 10% conversion, T-10) is observed at 426 degrees C, which is significantly lower than that of the reference Pt/Al2O3 (T-10 = 537 degrees C) and comparable with that of the Pt/SrCrO4 catalyst (T-10 = 414 degrees C). The SrCrO4 catalyst shows a stable, multi-cycle PM oxidation performance for the tested five cycles, and both its crystalline structure and morphology remain unchanged even after its multiple cycles of use. The structure of the SrCrO4 catalyst is stable even after moisture and SO2 treatments, and the catalytic PM oxidation activity of SrCrO4 is not compromised even after these harsh treatments. Importantly, the SrCrO4 catalyst is also stable after PM oxidation conducted using real world PM from a heavy-duty vehicle. These results demonstrate that the mixed oxide phase of SrCrO4 shows promise for PM oxidation.

TI In situ formation of Ni3Se4 nanorod arrays
   as versatile electrocatalysts for electrochemical oxidation reactions in
   hybrid water electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Water splitting is limited by the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution, thus extensive studies have focused on developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Nevertheless, replacing sluggish water oxidation with smart anodic reactions would greatly lower the overall cost of energy and the electrode by using earth-abundant electrocatalysts. Herein, a Ni3Se4 nanorod array is prepared by an in situ hydrothermal selenization method and demonstrates excellent activity for anodic reactions. Assisted by this versatile Ni3Se4 nanorod array, only 240mV overpotential is required to drive 10 mA cm(-2) of oxygen evolution current steadily. By substituting oxygen evolution with urea and hydrazine oxidation, the anodic potential can be reduced from 1.47 V to 1.38 V and even further to 0.32 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) anodic current density. Substituting anodic reactions coupled with the non-precious electrocatalyst demonstrated in the hybrid water electrolysis in this study has promising potential for future energy conversion, environmental treatment and valuable chemical upgrading.

TI CO Activation Using Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Reductive
   Carbonylation of Nitroaromatics to Benzimidazolinone and Phenyl Urea
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Carbonylation of nitroaromatics with CO is extensively investigated with efficient but precious group 8-10 metal-based catalysts for the productions of both industrially and academically important chemicals such as isocyanates, formamides, carbamates, ureas and several types of heterocyclic compounds. Herein, we report that rationally designed nitrogendoped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) exhibit catalytic activity toward CO activation for carbonylation of nitroaromatics to benzimidazolinones and ureas. Under the optimal conditions, N-CNT-promoted intramolecular carbonylation of 2-nitroaniline (1a) with CO leads to formation of 1,3-dihydro-2H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-one in 90% yield. Moreover, an intermolecular carbonylation of nitrobenzene and aniline with CO in the presence of the N-CNT gives 70% yield of N,N'-diphenylurea. The N-CNT is also applicable to various benzimidazolinones and phenyl ureas; moreover, it can be readily reused at least 9 times for the carbonylation. The theoretical investigation based on density functional theory calculations indicates that the graphitic N of the N-CNT plays a crucial step in the 1a reduction with CO. The correlation between the structural defect and catalytic performance of the N-CNT reveals an enhanced catalytic activity of the N-CNT with its increased structural defects. This research thus represents a major breakthrough in CO activation for nitroaromatic carbonylation with environmental-friendly, low-cost, and carbon-based catalysts as a potential alternative to expensive and scarce noble-metalbased catalysts.

TI Influence of Co-Precipitation Agent on the Structure, Texture and
   Catalytic Activity of Au-CeO2 Catalysts in Low-Temperature
   Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol
SO CATALYSTS
AB The aim of the study was to establish the influence of a co-precipitation agent (i.e., NaOH-immediate precipitation; hexamethylenetetramine/urea-gradual precipitation and growth of nanostructures) on the properties and catalytic activity of as-synthesized Au-CeO2 nanocomposites. All catalysts were fully characterized with the use of XRD, nitrogen physisorption, ICP-OES, SEM, HR-TEM, UV-vis, XPS, and tested in low-temperature oxidation of benzyl alcohol as a model oxidation reaction. The results obtained in this study indicated that the type of co-precipitation agent has a significant impact on the growth of gold species. Immediate co-precipitation of Au-CeO2 nanostructures with the use of NaOH allowed obtainment of considerably smaller and more homogeneous in size gold nanoparticles than those formed by gradual co-precipitation and growth of Au-CeO2 nanostructures in the presence of hexamethylenetetramine or urea. In the catalytic tests, it was established that the key factor promoting high activity in low-temperature oxidation of benzyl alcohol was size of gold nanoparticles. The highest conversion of the alcohol was observed for the catalyst containing the smallest Au particle size (i.e., Au-CeO2 nanocomposite prepared with the use of NaOH as a co-precipitation agent).

TI Direct and Activated Chlorine Dioxide Oxidation for Micropollutant
   Abatement: A Review on Kinetics, Reactive Sites, and Degradation Pathway
SO WATER
AB Recently, ClO2-based oxidation has attracted increasing attention to micropollutant abatement, due to high oxidation potential, low disinfection byproduct (DBPs) formation, and easy technical implementation. However, the kinetics, reactive sites, activation methods, and degradation pathways involved are not fully understood. Therefore, we reviewed current literature on ClO2-based oxidation in micropollutant abatement. In direct ClO2 oxidation, the reactions of micropollutants with ClO2 followed second-order reaction kinetics (k(app) = 10(-3)-10(6) M-1 s(-1) at neutral pH). The k(app) depends significantly on the molecular structures of the micropollutant and solution pH. The reactive sites of micropollutants start with certain functional groups with the highest electron densities including piperazine, sulfonyl amido, amino, aniline, pyrazolone, phenol groups, urea group, etc. The one-electron transfer was the dominant micropollutant degradation pathway, followed by indirect oxidation by superoxide anion radical (O-2(center dot-)) or hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot). In UV-activated ClO2 oxidation, the reactions of micropollutants followed the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics with the rates of 1.3 x 10(-4)-12.9 s(-1) at pH 7.0. Their degradation pathways include direct ClO2 oxidation, direct UV photolysis, ozonation, (OH)-O-center dot-involved reaction, and reactive chlorine species (RCS)-involved reaction. Finally, we identified the research gaps and provided recommendations for further research. Therefore, this review gives a critical evaluation of ClO2-based oxidation in micropollutant abatement, and provides recommendations for further research.

TI Zero-valent iron supported on nitrogen-doped carbon xerogel as catalysts
   for the oxidation of phenol by fenton-like system
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Nitrogen-free and nitrogen-doped carbon xerogel materials, from urea and melamine precursors, were prepared at different pH and evaluated as adsorbents/catalysts in the removal of phenol. Then, zero-valent iron (ZVI) was supported on these carbon xerogel materials and its activity was again evaluated for phenol removal by adsorption and catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO). The prepared samples were characterized by N-2 adsorption at -196 degrees C, pH at the point of zero charge (pH(PZC)) and elemental analysis. The textural properties of the N-free and N-doped carbon xerogels are strongly influenced by pH of the preparation solution and precursor used. The presence of ZVI on all carbon xerogel supports improved the phenol removal efficiency. ZVI supported on urea- and melamine-doped carbon xerogels show a good performance, reaching above 87% phenol conversion after 60 min of CWPO. On the contrary, pure adsorption and CWPO using the same materials without the presence of ZVI gives low phenol removal efficiency. A correlation was found between the activity of ZVI catalysts in CWPO and the N-content of the supports.

SO MRS COMMUNICATIONS
AB In the present work, it is demonstrated that a synergistic effect on the CO oxidation reaction can be achieved depending on the cobalt loading and deposition order of metal precursors employed in the synthesis of Au-Co3O4/Al2O3 catalysts by the deposition precipitation with urea method. The atomic arrangement of Au and Co3O4 exerts an important influence on the catalytic activity. Intermediate reaction species in the studied systems were identified through DRIFTS spectroscopy, which provided insights into the reaction mechanism. The formation of Au-0 and Au delta- as active sites for CO oxidation, along with mono- and bidentate bicarbonate ligands as active reaction intermediates, was elucidated.

TI Stability of Ni/SiO2 in Partial Oxidation of Methane: Effects
   of W Modification
SO ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA
AB With the discovery and large-scale exploitation of natural gas resources such as shale gas and combustible ice, which are mainly composed of methane, their effective utilization has become a national strategic interest. Partial oxidation of methane (POM) to synthesis gas is one of the important methods for the utilization of natural gas and shale gas resources. The commonly used Ni/SiO2 catalyst for POM easily deactivates due to carbon deposition on the surface. To solve this problem, a urea precipitation method was employed in this work to prepare Ni-based catalysts modified with different amounts of tungsten (at W/Ni molar ratios of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.10), and the catalyst stability in POM as well as the role of W were investigated. From characterizations such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we obtained the following results. The amount of W added to the Ni-based catalysts has a significant influence on their catalytic performances in POM and their physicochemical properties. The particle size of Ni in the catalysts decreases with W addition, and the Ni particle distribution on the support surfaces becomes more uniformed; however, the catalytic activity for POM is not significantly influenced. However, W-modified Ni-based catalysts show an increasing improvement in their stability in POM with increasing W/Ni molar ratio, with an optimum at the W/Ni molar ratio of 0.07; at the W/Ni molar ratio of 0.10, they exhibit a rapid deactivation in POM in a short time. Although interactions between Ni and SiO2 in the as-prepared catalysts are weak, the presence of adequate tungsten (W/Ni molar ratio of 0.05 and above) in the Ni-based catalysts can reduce the Ni particle size to some extent, and lead to the formation of strong interactions between Ni and W, which leads to an improvement in the dispersion of Ni on the support surface and imparts resistance for Ni particle growth in the POM reaction. The increased interaction between Ni and W changes the chemical state or oxygen affinity of Ni particles on the catalyst surfaces, and some of the partially oxidized Ni species (Ni delta+) on the catalyst surfaces coexist with reduced Ni species (Ni-0) during POM. Using an adequate amount of W-modified Ni catalysts results in almost no carbon deposition on the surfaces during POM, but using only a moderate amount results in good catalytic behavior and stability in POM. This finding suggests that the presence of W can not only enhance the anti-coking ability of the Ni-based catalysts and sustain their good stability in POM if the W content is low (i.e., W/Ni molar ratio of 0.07 and below), but also lead to the deactivation of W-modified catalysts in POM if the W content is high (i.e., W/Ni molar ratio of 0.10 and above), due to high oxygen affinity or the presence of more Ni species in oxidized form. In addition, alpha-WC (tungsten carbide) was identified using XRD to be formed on the surface of the moderate-amount W-modified Ni catalysts after POM, and it could inhibit or eliminate carbon deposition on the Ni-based catalyst surfaces. The catalytic performance evaluation of the catalysts in POM under a long time period confirmed that alpha-WC is stable.

TI Electromembrane separation coupled with urea electrolysis for
   energy-saving recovery of quaternary ammonium hydroxide from industrial
   wastewater
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY
AB The electrolytic recovery of quaternary ammonium hydroxide (R4NOH) from the wastewater produced in the process of template-synthesizing molecular sieves has considerable economic benefits. The current practices are challenged by the anode corrosion and high operation costs due to harmful chlorine chemicals in wastewater and high energy consumption. This work proposes a promising energy-saving strategy by combining the recovery of quaternary ammonium hydroxides with urea electrolysis technology. This strategy reduces the anodic oxidation potential and achieves low-energy consumption while avoid-ing the formation of hypochlorite ions. Through the laboratory-scale closed membrane electrolysis sys-tem (CMES) cycle test, it was found that when the cathode output concentration of 0.5 M was reached at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), the energy consumption was saved by 64.7% compared with the traditional technology. Along with the achievement of the expected recovery rate, the high value-added R4NOH were recycled. More specifically, the ultra-low voltage of the electrolyze protected the ecosystem by avoiding the corrosion of harmful chlorine chemicals and demonstrated the potential for large-scale applications at the reduced process costs.

TI Insights into in situ surface reconstruction in cobalt perovskite oxides
   for enhanced catalytic activity
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB An depth understanding of the fundamental interactions between surface termination and catalytic activity is crucial to prompt the properties of functional perovskite materials. The elastic energy due to size mismatch and electrostatic attraction of the charged Sr dopant by positively charged oxygen vacancies induced inert A-site surface enrichment rearrangement for perovskites. Lower temperatures could reduce A-site enrichment, but it is difficult to form perovskite crystals. La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3- delta (LSCO) as a model perovskite oxide was modified with additive urea to reduce the crystallization temperature, and suppress Sr segregation. The LSCO catalysts with 600 degrees C annealing temperature (LSCO-600) exhibited a 19.4-fold reaction reactivity of toluene oxidation than that with 800 degrees C annealing temperature (LSCO-800). Combined surface-sensitive and depth-resolved techniques for surface and sub-surface analysis, surface Sr enrichment was effectively suppressed due to decreased oxygen vacancy concentration and smaller electrostatic driving force. DFT calculations and in-situ DRIFTs spectra well revealed that tuning the surface composition/termination affected the intrinsic reactivity. The catalyst surface with lower Sr enrichment could easily adsorb toluene, cleave, and decompose benzene rings, thus contributing to toluene degradation to CO 2 . This work demonstrates a green and efficient way to control surface composition and termination at the atomic scale for higher catalytic activity.

TI Effect of mixed inhibitor application on N2O production
   pathways in paddy soil
SO JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB Purpose In flooded paddy soils, quantifying and discerning nitrous oxide (N2O) production by four biological pathways (nitrifier nitrification (NN), nitrifier denitrification (ND), nitrification-coupled denitrification (NCD), and heterotrophic denitrification (HD)) are essential for developing innovative strategies to mitigate the greenhouse effect. Materials and methods Soils were collected from Shenyang Experimental Station of the Institute of Applied Ecology, Liaoning Province, China, and were sealed and incubated in the dark at 25 degrees C and submerged for 48 h. The amount of N2O produced by each of the four pathways and the abundance of corresponding functional genes were determined by dual-isotope (N-15-O-18) labeling technique combined with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results and discussion In our incubation experiment, N-15 isotope tracing showed that not urea but paddy soil was the largest contributor of N2O within 48 h after urea application. Combined application of urea and mixed inhibitors (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) + phenylphosphorodiamidate (PPD) + 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP)) could reduce total N2O production by 26.69%. Through dual-isotope (O-18-N-15) labeling technology, it was found that N2O production mainly came from HD pathway, accounting for 77% of total N2O production, and N2O produced by ammonia oxidation (NN, ND, and NCD) after urea application accounted for 23% of total N2O production. The largest proportion of N2O production among the ammonia oxidation pathways was the ND pathway (0-23.00%), followed by the NN pathway (0-19.21%) and NCD pathway (0-3.79%). Application of mixed inhibitors significantly reduced the N2O produced by the HD pathway by more than 15%; reduced the N2O produced by the ammonia oxidation pathway from 23.00 to 10.39%; and reduced the N2O produced by the NN, ND, and NCD pathways by more than 50%. This is probably caused by the decreased ammonium level and reduced gene copies of AOB amoA, narG, and nirK, which are key N2O producing genes. Conclusions Incubation experiment showed that ammonia oxidation pathway is also an important pathway for N2O production in flooded paddy soil. Mixed inhibitors have inhibitory effects on N2O produced by NN, ND, NCD, and HD pathways. The future development of mixed inhibitor application strategies suitable for paddy fields is of great significance for mitigating the global greenhouse effect.

TI Transition metal atom M (M = Fe, Co, Cu, Cr) doping and oxygen vacancy
   modulated M-Ni5P4-NiMOH nanosheets as
   multifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient overall water splitting
   and urea electrolysis reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB It is significant to develop reasonable and efficient hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts to alleviate the energy crisis, yet challenging to produce hydrogen through the electrolysis of water and urea. In this work, the dual control strategy of doping and vacancy creation was used to improve the electrocatalytic performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the design of a multifunctional catalyst. A series of M-doped-Ni5P4/M-doped Ni(OH)(2) (M = Fe, Co, Cu, Cr) hierarchical materials with abundant oxygen vacancies was constructed for the first time by hydrothermal and partial phosphating methods. The Co-doped-Ni5P4/Co-doped-Ni(OH)(2) (Co-Ni5P4-NiCoOH) exhibited superior performance in HER, OER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Moreover, the electrode couple is fitted with two Co-Ni5P4-NiCoOH (C-NP-NCOH) electrodes to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2); the necessary cell voltage was 1.57 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea for urea electrolysis and water electrolysis required a 1.6 V cell voltage in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. The experimental results suggest that the co-action of Co-doping and oxygen vacancies increases the specific surface area of the material, enhances the electronic conductivity and promotes the exposure of more active sites, thus improving the water splitting and urea electrolysis performances of the catalyst. Density functional theory analysis suggests that Co-Ni5P4-NiCoOH displays optimal adsorption energy of water and electrical conductivity, thus optimizing the adsorption/desorption of intermediates.

TI Study on removing marine multiple pollutants in raw exhaust gas with a
   novel composited method combined with pre-agglomeration and wet
   scrubbing technology
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Most of the existing oxidation denitrification methods need longer residence time to obtain higher NOx removal efficiency. In this study, urea peroxide (CO(NH2)(2)center dot H2O2) was first used for removing SO2 and NOx on diesel engine bench. The addition of ferrous sulfate can enhance the oxidant capacity of the solution. The better removal efficiency and lower nitrate content in liquid can be achieved in short exhaust gas residence time. The raw gas flow and residence time contained the actual application situation in ships and have high reference value. The removal efficiency decreased with the increase of gas flow, and the reaction temperature, urea peroxide concentration, liquid-gas ratio were the main factors. The optimal Fe2+ concentration of 50 mmol/L and pH value of 4 were determined. The urea peroxide concentration, reaction temperature, and liquid-gas ratio were 9%, 70 celcius, and 10 L/m(3) respectively. The maximum gas treatment capacity was about 100 L/min, and residence time was close to 10 s for the scrubber. The pre-agglomerating method were used to improve the particle capturing efficiency combined with spray technology. The composited method can realize the synchronous and efficient removal of multiple pollutants in a single scrubber. The possibility of application on ship was further increased.

TI Synthesis and Visible-Light Photocatalytic Activity of Graphite-like
   Carbon Nitride Nanopowders
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB Graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanopowders were synthesized by heat treatment of urea in air at a temperature of 450-550 degrees C for 30 min and studied by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. The main processes resulting in the formation of g-C3N4 from urea under the above conditions was established using the method of simultaneous thermal analysis. It was found that with an increase in the processing temperature of urea from 450 to 550 degrees C, a rise in the specific surface of the powders occurs from 43.3 to 58.6 m(2) g(-1), as well as an increase in the crystallite sizes of graphite-like carbon nitride in the crystallographic direction (002) from 2.8 to 4.1 nm. According to the results of scanning electron microscopy and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, the obtained graphite-like carbon nitride powders have a mesoporous structure and are characterized by an average pore size of 6.6-13.8 nm and porosity of 0.07-0.20 cm(3) g(-1). According to the results of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, it was found that g-C3N4 nanopowders absorb radiation in the visible region and have a band gap of 2.9 eV. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained graphite-like carbon nitride during the oxidation of an aqueous murexide solution under the influence of visible light was analyzed and it was shown that the obtained g-C3N4 nanopowders have activity close to that of the commercial TiO2 photocatalyst (AEROXIDE P25). In view of the high activity and low cost, the obtained powders of graphite-like carbon nitride can be used as the substrate for new photocatalytic materials.

TI Construction of self-supporting, hierarchically structured
   caterpillar-like NiCo2S4 arrays as an efficient
   trifunctional electrocatalyst for water and urea electrolysis
SO NANOSCALE
AB In this study, we have developed intriguing self-supporting caterpillar-like spinel NiCo2S4 arrays with a hierarchical structure of nanowires on a nanosheet skeleton, which can be used as a self-supporting trifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The caterpillar-like NiCo precursor arrays are first in situ grown on carbon cloth (NiCo2O4/CC) by a facile hydrothermal reaction, which is followed by an anion exchange process (or sulfuration treatment) with Na2S to form self-supporting spinel NiCo2S4 arrays (NiCo2S4/CC) with a roughened nanostructure. Taking advantage of the bimetallic synergistic effect, the unique hierarchical nanostructure, and the self-supporting nature, the resultant NiCo2S4/CC electrode exhibits high activities toward the OER, HER and UOR, which are highly superior to the monometallic counterparts of NiS nanosheets and Co9S8 nanowires on a carbon cloth substrate. The comparison of the three electrodes also indicates that the hierarchically structured bimetallic electrode combines the morphological and structural characteristics of monometallic Ni-based nanosheets and Co-based nanowires. When assembling a two-electrode electrolytic cell with NiCo2S4/CC as both the anode and cathode, an applied cell voltage of only 1.66 V is required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in water electrolysis. By using the same two-electrode setup, the applied voltage for urea electrolysis is further reduced to 1.45 V that produces hydrogen at the cathode with the same current density. This study paves the way for exploring the feasibility of future less energy-intensive and large-scale hydrogen production.

TI Regulation the electrocatalytic performance of Ni-MOF derived material
   by extending the organic ligand
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB The overuse of fossil fuels has accelerated the desire for clean energy. Hydrogen energy has become an important energy on the world energy stage in the 21st century. Hydrogen production technology has also become the focus of attention. Based on the previous reported Ni-bib (bib = 1,4-bis(1H-imidazole-1-yl) benzene), Ni-bibp (bibp = 4,4'-bi(1H-imidazole-1-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl) with longer ligand was designed and synthesized by solvothermal method. Its molecular formula is {[Ni-4(bibp)(4)(SO42-)(4)(H2O)(8)]}(n). Ni-bibp-900 derived from high temperature pyrolysis can be used as bi-functional electrode material for HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) and UOR (urea oxidation reaction). For HER, the overpotential is -297mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope of the Ni-bibp-900 is 153.3 mV center dot dec(-1). For UOR, the overpotential is 1.4 V when the current density is 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope of the Ni-bibp-900 is 97.53 mV center dot dec(-1). The performance of UOR and HER is better than that of Ni-bib-T. In addition, we also studied the effect of different doping amounts of zinc ions on HER. The results show that the HER performance is improved after doping zinc ion, which may be attributed to the sublimation of zinc ions during the pyrolysis process.

TI Engineering low-valent molybdenum sites in CoMoO4 nanosheets
   to boost electrochemical nitrogen-rich wastewater treatment
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB Electrochemical coupling nitrate-to-ammonia (NO3--to-NH3) with urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is attractive for both energy-saving ammonia synthesis and comprehensive nitrogen-rich wastewater treatment. However, developing the efficient electrocatalyst that simultaneously promotes hydrogenation of NO3- - and UOR is still challenging. Here, we engineered the porous CoMoO4 nanosheets with rich low-valent Mo sites (Mo(L)-CoMoO4-x) as a difunctional electrocatalyst for both NO3--to-NH3 and UOR. The Mo(L)-CoMoO4-x displayed high Faradaic efficiency (93.33%) and selectivity (91.16%) for NO3--to-NH3 and low potential (1.31 V vs. RHE) at 100 mA cm(-2) toward UOR. Impressively, a low cell voltage of 1.83 V was needed for coupling UOR with NO3--to-NH3 in twoelectrode system. Mechanism study revealed that the introduction of low-valent Mo sites in CoMoO4 nanosheets accelerated the activation kinetics and multistep hydrogenation of NO3-, and also promoted the reconstruction of active CoOOH species for UOR, resulting the difunctional catalytic property for NO3--to-NH3 and UOR.

TI Synthesis and flash sintering of zirconium nitride powder
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB Zirconium nitride (ZrN) is a transition metal nitride of great interest due to its excellent physical and chemical properties. This study aims to synthesize ZrN fine powders by a facile and low-cost urea route that avoids the use of any solvent. ZrCl4 and urea mixtures were heat-treated at up to 1600C in nitrogen gas. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The effects of different processing parameters such as metal to urea molar ratio, heat treatment temperature, and dwelling time on the product phase and stoichiometry were studied to understand the synthesis method. In addition, synthesized ZrN powder was consolidated into near fully dense single-phase bulk ceramic with a homemade flash sintering setup. A constant DC electrical field of similar to 80 V/cm and pressure of similar to 14 MPa at room temperature triggered flash sintering without pre-heating, and the entire process finished in 200 s. The composition, microstructure, density, hardness, and oxidation properties of the sintered pellet were also characterized.

Most appealingly, the reaction can proceed smoothly without adding any strong oxidants. Control experiments and computational studies support a mechanism involving water-assisted in situ generation of thioureas and photocatalytic oxidative desulphurisation.

Crystalline and spherical Ag nanoparticles (NPs) with an average particle size of 2 nm were found in the rGO-Ag nanocomposite with the assistance of 5.0 M ascorbic acid. The electrochemical properties of the rGO-Ag nanocomposite-modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode were investigated for the oxidation of NO. The rGO-Ag (5.0 M) nanocomposite-modified electrode displayed a higher catalytic current response compared to other controlled modified electrodes in cyclic voltammetry toward the oxidation of NO in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 2.5). The electroanalytical application of the nanocomposite was performed using an amperometry technique, and the limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 2.84 mu M for the in situ detection of NO. The present nanocomposite was stable, sensitive, and selective in the presence of the common physiological interferents such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, dopamine, glucose, urea, and NaCl.

TI Porous nickel sulfide nanorods serve as a multifunctional
   electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, urea
   electrooxidation reaction, and nitrate reduction reaction
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Rational design and simple synthesis of multifunctional electrocatalysts have significant implications across various scientific and industrial fields. In this work, we successfully synthesized nickel sulfide catalysts featuring a one-dimensional porous nanorod morphology (NiS-NRs) through a hard-template-high-temperature calcination approach. In this method, nickel-dimethylglyoxime complex nanorods ((DMG)2Ni) served as a precursor and inexpensive thiourea as a sulfur source. The urea electrooxidation reaction (UEOR) in water electrolysis presents an opportunity to replace the kinetics-limited oxygen evolution reaction (OER), offering an energy-efficient means of hydrogen production. For the urea electrooxidation reaction, an overvoltage of 1.37 V (versus RHE) was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Similarly, for the hydrogen evolution reaction, a modest overvoltage of 255 mV resulted in a current density of 10 mA cm-2. In a two-electrode system, the NiS-NR & Vert;NiS-NR urea electrolyzer demanded a potential of 1.24 V at 1 mA cm-2, surpassing the aqueous electrolyzer requirement (1.41 V vs. RHE). Meanwhile, the as-prepared NiS-NRs also showed a high nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance, with a high NH3 yield rate (0.513 mmol h-1 mgcat-1) at -0.65 V vs. RHE. These results verified that the high-temperature calcination process employing a hard template effectively preserved the one-dimensional morphology of the initial template. The resultant nickel sulfide catalysts exhibit commendable electrocatalytic performance for urea electrooxidation, hydrogen evolution and nitrate reduction reactions.
   The proposed hard-template-high-temperature calcination method effectively maintains the morphology of the template, and the prepared NiS electrocatalyst exhibits excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performance.

TI Exploring the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of tin sulfide
   decorated manganese iron oxide in alkaline and urea contaminated water
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Efficient, affordable, and stable electrocatalysts are pivotal for large-scale water splitting. Herein, we report an optimized decoration of tin sulfide (SnS) bundles on porous manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4) on nickel foam for enhancing the overall water splitting. This decoration yielded an interfacial Sn-O bond between MnFe2O4 and SnS, stabilized the structure, and provided optimistic adsorption energies for oxygen and hydrogen. The decorated electrode exhibited overpotentials of 383 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 127 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 20 mA.cm- 2. Moreover, the decorated sample demonstrated reduced overpotentials of 272 mV and 75 mV (at 20 mA cm- 2) for OER and HER in urea-contaminated water. The augmented double layer capacitance (Cdl) electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of the decorated sample corroborated the enhanced performances and effectiveness of the SnS decoration. Furthermore, SnS-decorated MnFe2O4 showed outstanding performance in a two-cell configuration with a cell voltage of 1.69 V and 1.52 V (@10 mA cm- 2) under alkaline KOH and urea (0.33 M) electrolyte, respectively. Further, the chronoamperometry and post-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies demonstrated the stability and promising potential of this electrode for future non-noble metal-based bifunctional catalytic applications.

TI Novel hyperbranched resin for wood adhesive: Based on air oxidation and
   crosslinking copolymerization strategy
SO POLYMER TESTING
AB At present, environmentally friendly high-performance wood adhesives have received widespread attention. Glucose and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TAEA) were used as raw materials in this study. In the absence of catalysts, glucose-based wood adhesives with the hyperbranched crosslinking structure were prepared by the one-pot based on air oxidation and crosslinking copolymerization. The structures of the polymers were characterized by FT-IR, 13C NMR, LC-MS, and XPS. The results indicated that the interaction between glucose and TAEA is achieved through the dehydration reaction of carboxylic acid and primary amine, as well as the esterification reaction of carboxylic acid and alcohol. The hyperbranched polymer resin (GT) was successfully synthesized and used as a wood adhesive. The curing and thermal stability of GT adhesive were studied by DSC and TGA, and the results showed that GT had good thermal stability. The best-performing GT adhesive was screened by changing the molar ratio of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine/glucose and reaction time using the controlled variable method. The prepared GT adhesive has reached the national standard GB/T 17657-2013 (& GE;0.7 MPa) through the test of adhesive strength and water resistance. The dry shear strength of the plywood reached 1.97 MPa, and the strengths were 1.64 MPa and 1.31 MPa after immersion in hot and boiling water for 3 h. The experimental process is simple and green and the prepared hyperbranched glucose-based adhesive has excellent performance. Therefore, it has potential application prospects as a formaldehyde-free wood adhesive.

TI Rh single atoms/clusters confined in metal sulfide/oxide nanotubes as
   advanced multifunctional catalysts for green and energy-saving hydrogen
   productions
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB In this work, smart strategies are conducted to design advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts: Co3S4/CoOx heterostructured nanosheets-assembled nanotube arrays on 3D framework integrated with single Rh atoms and subnanometer clusters. The catalyst can reach current density of 10 mA cm-2 at low overpotentials of 248.2, and 56.1 mV for oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. The catalyst also shows very low potential of 1.32 V for urea oxidation reaction at 10 mA cm-2. A water electrolyzer that achieves current density of 10 mA cm-2 at small cell voltage of 1.45 V is prepared under action of the developed catalyst. We also conduct urea electrolysis assembled with the catalyst and find that the device requires a cell voltage of only 1.35 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, proving the great potential of our catalyst for simultaneous energy-saving H2 production and the treatment of urea-rich wastewater.

TI Cobalt decorated graphitic carbon nitride photoanode for electrochemical
   ethanol oxidation: A sustainable way towards clean energy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Energy conversion devices based on liquid fuels have gained considerable attention in recent times to meet the increasing global demand for energy. In this work, graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) nanosheets have been synthesized by pyrolysis of urea and Co has been decorated in different molar ratios over its surface by the solution phase method. The prepared catalysts have been utilized for photo electrooxidation of ethanol, an anodic half cell reaction in direct ethanol fuel cells. Electrochemical studies show that the catalyst containing 3 mol % of Co shows the best activity with a peak current density of 6.91 mA/ cm2 obtained at a peak potential of 0.28 V with maximum current density of 40 mA/cm2. The effect of light on the catalytic activity has also been studied. On illuminating the surface of the electrode with light, an increment of 85% in current density is observed which indicates higher charge transfer that enhanced the photoactivity of the catalyst. This study confirms the practical applicability of the non-expensive carbonaceous material Co-C3N4 utilization as a photoanode in future energy systems.& COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI Treatment of phenol by catalytic wet air oxidation: a comparative study
   of copper and nickel supported on γ-alumina, ceria and γ-alumina-ceria
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Cu, Ni, CuO and NiO catalysts, prepared by wet impregnation with urea and supported on gamma-Al2O3, CeO2, and Al2O3-CeO2, were evaluated for Catalytic Wet Air Oxidation (CWAO) of phenol in a batch reactor under a milder condition (120 degrees C and 10 bar O-2). The synthesized samples, at their calcined and/or their reduced form, were characterized by XRD, H-2-TPR, N-2 adsorption-desorption, SEM-EDS and DR-UV-Vis to explain the differences observed in their catalytic activity towards the studied reaction. The influence of the support on the efficiency of CWAO of phenol at 120 degrees C and 10 bar of pure oxygen has been examined and compared over nickel and copper species. The SEM-EDS results reveal that the spherical crystalline Cu and Ni were successfully deposited on the surface of gamma-Al2O3, CeO2, Al2O3-CeO2 within 16-90 nm and that they were highly homogeneously dispersed. It was found that catalysts prepared from impregnation solutions of Cu(NO3)(2)center dot 3H(2)O and Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O with urea addition had different textural characteristics and degrees of dispersion of Cu and Ni species. The urea addition in the traditional wet impregnation method was essential to improve the reducibility and degree of dispersion in Ni, and to a lesser extent, in Cu. According to the characterization analysis of H-2-TPR and UV-VIS RD a structure-activity relationship can be determined. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and GC analyses confirmed the effect of calcined and reduced species for Cu and Ni applied to the catalytic oxidation of phenol, showing their significant impact in the final performance of the catalyst.

TI Coupled electrocatalytic hydrogen production
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING R-REPORTS
AB Hydrogen has emerged as a clean and renewable energy source with the potential to mitigate global energy and environmental crises. Electrolytic water splitting, a highly efficient and sustainable technology, has garnered significant attention for hydrogen production. However, the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction on the anode and the high energy consumption limit the practicality of industrial-scale electrocatalytic water splitting. To address the challenge, the development of advanced electrolytic systems and the exploration of alternative oxidation reactions are crucial. This review highlights the recent advancements in coupled electrocatalytic hydrogen production strategies, including urea and hydrazine oxidation, value-adding electrosynthesis using small molecules, and waste upcycling and degradation. Various catalysts, the pertinent catalytic mechanisms for anodic oxidation reactions, and methods to decrease the energy barriers are discussed. Furthermore, the potential challenges and prospects for energy-saving electrolysis and promotion of hydrogen production are examined. A comprehensive understanding of these strategies and their implications is important to the development of efficient and sustainable hydrogen production.

TI Impacts of urea and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate on nitrification,
   targeted ammonia oxidizers, non-targeted nitrite oxidizers, and bacteria
   in two contrasting soils
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB This study explored the effects of combined urea and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on several components critical to the soil system: net nitrification rates; communities of targeted ammonia oxidizers [ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) and complete ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (comammox)]; non-targeted nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and bacteria. We conducted the study in two contrasting soils (acidic and neutral) over the course of 28 days. Our results indicated that DMPP had higher inhibitory efficacy in the acidic soil (30.7%) compared to the neutral soil (12.1%). The abundance of AOB and Nitrospira-like NOB were positively associated with nitrate content in acidic soil. In neutral soil, these communities were joined by the abundance of AOA and Nitrobacter-like NOB in being positively associated with nitrate content. By blocking the growth of AOB in acidic soil-and the growth of both AOB and comammox in neutral soil-DMPP supported higher rates of AOA growth. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that urea and urea + DMPP treatments significantly increased the diversity indices of bacteria, including Chao 1, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson in the acidic soil but did not do so in the neutral soil. However, both urea and urea + DMPP treatments obviously altered the community structure of bacteria in both soils relative to the control treatment. This experiment comprehensively analyzed the effects of urea and nitrification inhibitor on functional guilds involved in the nitrification process and non-targeted bacteria, not just focus on targeted ammonia oxidizers.

TI Carbohydrate and Lipid Prescription, Administration, and Oxidation in
   Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury: A Post Hoc Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF RENAL NUTRITION
AB Objective: In a prospective multicenter study on adult patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) receiving enteral andor parenteral nutrition, administered carbohydrates and lipids were compared to the prescribed amounts, as well as to substrate utilization data derived from indirect calorimetry measurements.
   Methods: Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by indirect calorimetry. Nitrogen excretion was obtained from the protein catabolic rate calculated from urinary urea nitrogen when available and by urea kinetic-based methods in patients on renal replacement therapy. Fat and carbohydrate oxidations were derived from Frayn formulas.
   Results: Ninety-two REE measurements were available in 35 critically ill patients with AKI (16 on renal replacement therapy). The mean lipid oxidation rate was 101 g/24 h (standard deviation [SD] 73.8), whereas prescribed lipids were 67 g/24 h (SD 32; P < .001). Carbohydrate utilization was derived from the same REE measurements yielding a mean carbohydrate oxidation of 105.8 g/24 h (SD 131.8), thus, much lower than the prescribed carbohydrates (186.7 g/24 h; SD 74.3; P < .001). The amount of fat and carbohydrates administered correlated to the prescribed amount (r = 0.896 and r = 0.829, respectively). Further analysis showed that this nutritional pattern was independent from the presence of sepsis.
   Conclusion: Our study suggests that critically ill patients with AKI do not receive an amount of carbohydrate and lipids adequate to support their needs on the basis of measured substrate utilization data. Thus, current nutritional approach in these patients, based on commercial formulas, should be challenged with measured substrate utilization-guided nutritional support.

TI Au nanoparticles confined in hybrid shells of silica nanospheres for

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Gold nanoparticles (NPs) confined in hybrid shells of organic linker-assisted silica nanospheres (GOS) have been prepared through a facile approach using organic amino functional groups covalently bound to shells of silica nanospheres for anchoring AuCl4 (-). Due to the hydrolysis of urea, the gold precursor was in situ reduced in the hybrid shells of silica nanospheres under desired alkaline and temperature conditions. Organic functional groups (-SiCH2CH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2) were introduced into shells of silica nanospheres via a co-condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate and 3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyl dimethoxymethylsilane. The results indicate that Au NPs with < 2 nm diameters were highly dispersed and well confined in the hybrid shells of silica nanospheres through the anchorage of organic functional groups under condensation process. The obtained GOS catalyst exhibited efficient catalytic activity for solvent-free catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane with 94.8% selectivity to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol (KA oil) and adipic acid under 150 A degrees C, 1.5 MPa O-2 for 3 h.

TI Efficiently simultaneous sorption and oxidation of antimonite on nitroso
   grafting-manganese loading binary-modified biochar from aqueous solution
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Modification of the biochar platform with organic reagents could enrich active functional groups, and incorporation of magnetic mineral on it could facilitate separation from the aqueous solution after practical application. The present research took advantage of both by performing -NO2 grafting and MnOx loading binary modification on biochar derived from bagasse. The results demonstrated that the binary modification dramatically enhanced the antimonite (Sb(III)) adsorption ability of the sole-modified biochar. The Sb(III) sorption experiment revealed the optimal binary modified parameters were 300 degrees C pyrolysis temperature and the reagent doses of 2.0 g urea, 1.0 g NaOH, 1.5 mL CCl4, 2.0 g NaNO2, and 0.1 g KMnO4. Binary-modified biochar synthesized under the optimal condition (MNBC300) could efficiently remove Sb(III) in the aqueous solution with an adsorption amount of 142.86 mg/g, which was much higher than that of the sole (27.70 and 13.43 mg/g). At a fast rate, the Sb(III) sorption behavior was governed by multilayer heterogeneous chemisorption adsorption via the complexation between-NO2/Mn-O bond and Sb(III). Fitting peaks on X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) demonstrated the oxidizability of MNBC300 due to the electron transfer from Sb(III) to Mn3+, which was thereby oxidizing Sb(III) to less toxic Sb(V). Overall, the present study showed a novel biochar modification technique to eliminate the ecological and human health hazards of Sb-containing wastewater.

TI NiAl Layered Double Hydroxides and PdNiO as Multifunctional Anodes for
   Prospective Self-Powered Lab-on-a-Chip Dopamine Sensors
SO CHEMNANOMAT
AB The purpose of this work is the evaluation of two bimetallic materials, PdNiO and NiAl-layered double hydroxides (NiAl-LDHs) for their prospective use in Lab-on-a-Chip devices, in which urea contained in human urine is used as fuel to provide the energy required by the device and dopamine in the sample is detected. A urea microfluidic fuel cell, using human urine as fuel and NiAl-LDHs and PdNiO as anodes, was constructed and evaluated, resulting in a cell potential of 1 V with 50.19 mW/cm(2) power density for NiAl-LDHs and 0.9 V and 32.94 mW/cm(2) for PdNiO. The multifunctionality of these anodes was extended for detecting dopamine with detection limits of 7.38x10(-8) M and 5.46x10(-6) M for NiAl-LDHs and PdNiO, respectively. The higher content of hydroxides on NiAl-LDHs than PdNiO material allowed a better activity for urea oxidation and dopamine detection. These results show the prospects for self-powered biomedical Lab-on-a-Chip device development.

TI Metal-Free Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Ureas and Carbamates from
   CO2 and Amines via Isocyanate Intermediates
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB A mild and metal-free synthesis of aryl isocyanates from arylamines under an atmosphere of CO2 was developed. The carbamic acid intermediate, derived from the arylamine starting material and CO2 in the presence of DBU, is dehydrated by activated sulfonium reagents to generate the corresponding isocyanate. The latter can be detected by in situ IR and trapped by various amines and alcohols to make unsymmetrical ureas and carbamates, respectively. Dicarbamates can also be prepared in good yields via the mild dehydration of the corresponding dicarbamic acids.

TI New Experimental Results of NO x  Removal from Marine
   Diesel Engines by the Ozone/Urea System: Removal Efficiency and the
   NO x  Conversion Ratio
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB Ship exhaust gas greatly threatenshuman health and the environment.The ozone/urea system has the advantages of strong oxidability, excellentreducibility, and low reductant consumption. This paper thoroughlystudied the effects of urea concentration, O-3 concentration,initial pH, temperature, O-2 concentration, SO2 concentration, and initial NO concentration on NO (x) removal efficiency using the ozone/urea system. Moreover,this paper conducted a systematic study on the conversion proportionof NO (x) into nitrate and nitrite, whichis very important for the ship NO (x) wetmethod. Urea concentration and O-3 concentration playedimportant roles in NO (x) removal efficiency.Weak acid and weak alkali media could effectively improve NO (x) removal efficiency, but the reasons were completelydifferent. As the temperature increased, the NO (x) removal efficiency initially decreased and subsequentlyincreased. Besides, the increase of temperature and initial pH coulddecrease the conversion proportions of NO (x) into nitrate and nitrite. The increase of SO2 concentrationcould not only reduce the NO (x) removalefficiency but also increase the conversion proportion of NO (x) into nitrate. However, increasing SO2 could significantly decrease the conversion proportion of NO (x) into nitrite. Under the optimal conditionsof this paper, the NO (x) removal efficiencyreached 97.8% and the conversion proportion of NO (x) into nitrate was only 20.39%. In addition, the urea contentwas just 0.3 mol/L, which was far lower than that in the prior study.This illustrated that the ozone/urea system had excellent applicationpotential in marine exhaust gas purification.

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB In this work, we reported the synthesis and application of a new urea-benzoic acid containing ligand [(OEt)(3)Si(CH2)(3)-urea-benzoic acid] for the functionalization of silica coated magnetic nanoparticles. The resulting structure, namely Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)(3)-urea-benzoic acid, was characterized through different techniques including FT-IR, SEM, EDX-Mapping, VSM and TGA/DTG analysis. Then, Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)(3)-urea-benzoic acid was applied as a heterogeneous dual acidic and hydrogen bonding catalyst for the synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted thiazolidin-4-ones and hexahydroquinolines under mild and green reaction conditions. More importantly, all of the desired products were obtained with relatively good yields. Also, the catalyst was recovered and reused for four successive runs without significant reduction in yield of the model reaction.

TI Changes to amino acid composition of bloodmeal after chemical oxidation
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Bovine-derived bloodmeal can be decoloured using peracetic acid, extruded and injection moulded into a yellow translucent bioplastic. This plastic has different properties to extruded and injection moulded bloodmeal, in that it does not require sodium sulfite or urea to be extrudable. The effect of oxidation on the physical and chemical characteristics of the proteins during bloodmeal decolouring with PAA was studied by assessing changes in the amino acid profile. Polymer interactions, hydrophilicity and the destruction of cysteine crosslinks were measured indirectly by assessing protein solubility, molecular weight distribution and by synchrotron FT-IR analysis. Increasing peracetic acid concentration resulted in an increased loss of iron due to destruction of the porphyrin groups, increased solubility due to destruction or conversion of aromatic amino acids into hydrophilic groups, destruction of lysine, reduced protein content due to increased salt content in the final product, and a larger amount of smaller protein peptides but with a similar average molecular weight to bloodmeal. Amino acid analysis showed an increase in cysteine content in the product, FT-IR of the sulfur groups revealed that these were heavily oxidised, such that some would be unable to participate in disulfide bonds thereby increasing protein solubility.

TI Double nonmetal elements modified porous TiO2 homogeneous
   junction for efficient photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexane
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB The nitrogen-doped TiO2 with mesoporous structure, anatase/rutile homogeneous junction and surface carbon species were successfully synthesized by facile hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate and preheating under the sealed condition, followed by a urea-aided calcination process. Interestingly, the as-obtained carbon modified TiO2 intermediates prepared by pretreating at different temperatures showed a certain photocatalytic activity for cyclohexane oxidation, and the carbon species were deposited to the surfaces of TiO2 via the Ti-O-C bond. The microstructure and photocatalytic activity of the double nonmetal elements modified porous mixed-phase TiO2 microspheres were found to depend on the preheating conditions, and nitrogen was doped into TiO2 lattice, the co-modification of nitrogen and carbon jointly improved the light absorption capacity and reduced the band gap of TiO2. The construction of a mixed-phase junction further improved the photocatalytic performance of the co-modified TiO2 compared with pure anatase or rutile TiO2. The optimal catalyst (N-TiO2-3 b) displayed efficient and stable photocatalytic performance for three cycles. When the reaction was conducted in real outdoor circumstances, the high ketone yield (206.22 mu mol) and selectivity (99.92 %) were achieved. The synthetic method was simple and cheap, thus this work showed great potential for green production of fine chemicals under moderate conditions.

TI Investigation on a high gravity device for reduction of NOx emission
   from marine diesel engines
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB High gravity technology, as a process intensification technology, has demonstrated the great advantages in the field of gas purification on account of its excellent mass transfer efficiency and energy-efficient, but it is rarely applied in the field of nitrogen oxides (NOx) purification of marine diesel engine exhaust. In this paper, a high-gravity bowl-shaped-disk rotating bed (HBRB) without catalytic was designed for diesel exhaust after-treatment. A diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) was installed in the front of the HBRB to regenerate more nitrogen dioxide (NO2) easily reduced by urea. A bench test of a 6-cylinder marine diesel engine with the HBRB was carried out. The effects of the HBRB speeds, urea concentrations, and engine operating conditions on NOx purification efficiency in engine exhaust were experimentally investigated. The experimental result indicates that the maximum NOx removal efficiency of the HBRB can reach 69.1%. The improvement of the NOx removal efficiency is not obvious at the HBRB speed of over 1500 r/min. The pre-oxidation degree of nitric oxide (NO) and urea concentration largely affect the NOx removal efficiency. The HBRB has great potential in marine diesel engine exhaust denitration.

SO APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB Zirconium oxide complex-functionalized mesoporous MCM-41 (Zr-oxide@MCM-41) as an efficient and reusable catalyst is reported for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidant, with short reaction times in good to excellent yields at room temperature under solvent-free conditions. Also, a simple and efficient method is reported for the oxidative coupling of thiols into corresponding disulfides in good to high yields using H2O2 as oxidant in the presence of Zr-oxide@ MCM-41 as recoverable catalyst in ethanol at room temperature. A series of sulfides and thiols possessing functional groups was successfully converted into corresponding products. After completion of reactions the catalyst was easily separated with simple filtration from the reaction mixture and reused for several consecutive runs without significant loss of catalytic efficiency. The mesoporous catalyst was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction, transmission and scanning electron microscopies, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis.

TI In vitro and in vivo Metabolism of a Potent Inhibitor of
   Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase,
   1-(1-Propionylpiperidin-4-yl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)urea
SO FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB 1-(1-Propionylpiperidin-4-yl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)urea (TPPU) is a potent soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor that is used extensively in research for modulating inflammation and protecting against hypertension, neuropathic pain, and neurodegeneration. Despite its wide use in various animal disease models, the metabolism of TPPU has not been well-studied. A broader understanding of its metabolism is critical for determining contributions of metabolites to the overall safety and effectiveness of TPPU. Herein, we describe the identification of TPPU metabolites using LC-MS/MS strategies. Four metabolites of TPPU (M1-M4) were identified from rat urine by a sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method with double precursor ion scans. Their structures were further supported by LC-MS/MS comparison with synthesized standards. Metabolites M1 and M2 were formed from hydroxylation on a propionyl group of TPPU; M3 was formed by amide hydrolysis of the 1-propionylpiperdinyl group on TPPU; and M4 was formed by further oxidation of the hydroxylated metabolite M2. Interestingly, the predicted alpha-keto amide metabolite and 4-(trifluoromethoxy) aniline (metabolite from urea cleavage) were not detected by the LC-MRM-MS method. This indicates that if formed, the two potential metabolites represent <0.01% of TPPU metabolism. Species differences in the formation of these four identified metabolites was assessed using liver S9 fractions from dog, monkey, rat, mouse, and human. M1, M2, and M3 were generated in liver S9 fractions from all species, and higher amounts of M3 were generated in monkey S9 fractions compared to other species. In addition, rat and human S9 metabolism showed the highest species similarity based on the quantities of each metabolite. The presence of all four metabolites were confirmed in vivo in rats over 72-h post single oral dose of TPPU. Urine and feces were major routes for TPPU excretion. M1, M4 and parent drug were detected as major substances, and M2 and M3 were minor substances. In blood, M1 accounted for similar to 9.6% of the total TPPU-related exposure, while metabolites M2, M3, and M4 accounted for <0.4%. All four metabolites were potent inhibitors of human sEH but were less potent than the parent TPPU. In conclusion, TPPU is metabolized via oxidation and amide hydrolysis without apparent breakdown of the urea. The anilinemetabolites were not observed either in vitro or in vivo. Our findings increase the confidence in the ability to translate preclinical PK of TPPU in rats to humans and facilitates the potential clinical development of TPPU and other sEH inhibitors.

TI A Facile and Controllable Approach for Surface Modification of Wool by
   Micro-dissolution
SO FIBERS AND POLYMERS
AB Most modifications of wool focused on its surface due to the existence of the cuticle scales. For instance, chlorination, oxidation and protease treatments were used to break down or remove the scales. However, these modifications usually severely damaged the internal structure of wool. In this paper, a novel approach based on surface micro-dissolution was employed to modify the surface of wool to minimize the internal damage of wool, and improve the surface-related properties of wool. The micro-dissolution system used NaHSO3/urea to dissolve the scale layer of wool. After being micro-dissolved with NaHSO3/urea system, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), fluorescence microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the Allworden reaction were utilized to characterize the treated wool. Furthermore, felting shrinkage, strength loss and wettability of the treated wool were determined. The results showed that NaHSO3/urea system could dissolve the scale layer from outside to inside. The fluorescence microscopic images further indicated that low concentration of NaHSO3/urea system can dissolve the surface of wool without the serious damage of internal structure. Moreover, the micro-dissolution system can be controlled to dissolve the scale layer on the surface of wool slightly by adjusting the reaction conditions. The presented method is simple, easy to operate, and economical, thereby can open up new directions for the surface modification of wool.

TI Porous hollow manganites with robust composite shells for oxidation of
   CO at low temperature
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Yolk- and hollow-type manganite-coated silica (SiO2) microspheres were synthesized via the thermal hydrolysis of urea using a dissolution and deposition method. Core/shell SiO2 microspheres were used as templates; the products were then annealed at 700 degrees C for 10 h under an O-2 atmosphere. Yolk microspheres (Mn2O3/SiO2_1T and Mn2O3/SiO2_2T) were obtained when the dissolution and deposition step was repeated once and twice, respectively, while hollow microspheres (Mn2O3/SiO2_3T) were produced when the method was repeated three times. The microspheres had average diameters of 300-310 nm. The Mn2O3/SiO2_3T product possessed the largest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and exhibited the best catalytic performance with regard to CO oxidation. The complete conversion of CO was achieved at approximately 200 degrees C. Other microspheres, including Mn3O4/SiO2_3T, NiO/SiO2_3T, and Ni/SiO2_3T, yielded much lower activities than the Mn2O3/SiO2_3T catalyst. The large surface area of the Mn2O3/SiO2_3T microsphere sample, as well as the presence of Mn3+ ions, appears to be responsible for its superior catalytic CO oxidation activity amongst the tested catalysts.

TI Efficient hybrid water splitting and direct electrooxidation of organic
   dye from wastewater using copper cobalt sulphide nanosheets
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB One potential method to lower the cost of electrocatalytic green hydrogen production is to use metal sulfidebased electrocatalysts in hybrid water electrolysis. This work uses a one-step hydrothermal synthesis to create copper cobalt sulphide (CuCo2S4) nanosheets for hybrid water splitting. Significant water-splitting activity was achieved using urea and organic dye (methylene blue) as supporting electrolytes to avoid delayed OER kinetics. For the KOH + urea and KOH + organic dye electrolytes, the working electrode displays an overpotential of 1.37 V against RHE and 1.30 V vs RHE, respectively, to yield a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The CuCo2S4 working electrode exhibits an overpotential of 212 mV versus RHE and 158 mV vs RHE at 10 mA/cm2 current density while monitoring hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. For the KOH + organic dye electrolyte, the electrode exhibits exceptionally efficient electrocatalytic water splitting, with an overpotential of 1.50 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. At high current densities, the CuCo2S4 working electrode shows exceptional stability at industry standards throughout a broad pH range of basic, acidic, neutral, and saline environments. The use of several supporting electrolytes demonstrates an overall water splitting that is energy-efficient. Wastewater treatment can be accomplished through a circular economy strategy by merging the goals of environmental remediation (dye degradation) and renewable energy production (hydrogen evolution). This approach promotes sustainable growth, reduces waste, and encourages resource recovery. According to the internationally endorsed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), treating wastewater has the potential to help achieve 11 of the 17 SDGs.

TI Electrochemical formation and stability of copper selenide thin films in
   the choline chloride-urea deep eutectic solvent at gold electrode
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The electrodeposition of copper-selenium binary compounds on gold electrode was investigated in the choline chloride - urea (ChCl-U) deep eutectic solvent at 110 degrees C. Cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic deposition followed by stripping voltammetries were employed to gain thermodynamic insights pointing to the formation of Cu2Se, which is supported by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The electrochemical stability domain of the compound is about 900 mV (from approximate to-0.81 V to approximate to+0.07 V vs. a silver quasi-reference electrode) and is consistent with the thermodynamics of induced co-deposition. The domain is limited at positive potentials by the oxidation to Se(0) and at negative potentials by the reduction to Cu(0). While copper is readily deposited on the gold electrode, the electmdeposition of selenium requires a significant overpotential. As a consequence, copper is kinetically favoured in the co-deposition and is present in its pure form at short deposition times. This is circumvented by using longer deposition times or more negative potentials. Photoelectrochemical measurements show that the as-deposited compound behaves as a p-type semiconductor.

TI A Highly Sensitive Non-Enzymatic Urea Sensor Based on
   Ni(OH)2/Mn3O4/rGO/PANi Nanocomposites
   Using Screen-Printed Electrodes
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Herein, we have developed a highly sensitive non-enzymatic biosensor for the detection of the urea using nickel-manganese oxo/hydroxo metal nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide, and these nanocomposites were made using the hydrothermal reduction method. Then, the characteristics of these nanocomposites were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR spectroscopy), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), inductive coupled plasma (ICP), XRD surface mapping, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Next, a working electrode modification process was conducted via the electro-polymerization of nanocomposites with aniline on the surface of a screen-printed electrode. We realized that reduction and blocking of all graphene oxide functional groups is important in increasing of sensitivity and prevent protonation of aniline by graphene. Finally, the sensitivity of the modified electrode to urea was evaluated by the cyclic voltammetry method. The results indicate that the sensor works within an acceptable linear range 30 mu M to 3.3 mM, (R-2 = 0.995, n = 3). Highly sensitivity and the limit of detection are roughly 5139.2 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and 16.3 mu M, respectively. The sensor demonstrated impressive stability and significant anti-interference properties. Based on these features, it can be concluded that the fabricated sensor is reliable for the non-enzymatic detection of urea.

TI A Synergic Activity of Urea/Butyl Imidazolium Ionic Liquid Supported on
   UiO-66-NH2 Metal-Organic Framework for Synthesis of Oximes
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB An efficient supported ionic liquid catalyst is designed for condensation reaction of aldehydes and ketones. The Zr-based metal-organic framework (MOF), UiO-66-NH2, was initially functionalized with N,N '-dibutyl imidazolium ionic liquid (UiO-66-NH2-ILBr-), and then urea was attached to the ionic liquid (IL) to form a task-specific IL. Bromide was exchanged with tetrafluoroborate and the catalyst exhibits excellent performance for the synthesis of oximes. The ionic liquid/urea coupling showed a synergistic effect on the efficiency of the reaction. The supported catalyst system was recycled simply by filtration and reused for five times without significant decrease in its activity. The catalyst was characterized with PXRD, FTIR, TGA, XPS, BET, FE-SEM, EDS, elemental mapping and elemental analysis (CHN). Graphic MOF/IL/urea catalytic system was used for the synthesis of oximes

TI Urea-nonstoichiometric co-modulated LaMnO3 for ultra-high
   gaseous Hg<SUP>0</SUP> uptake across a broad temperature range
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB A novel urea-nonstoichiometric co-modulated Mn-perovskite material (2U-La0.8MnO3) was developed, exhibiting a remarkable Hg(0 )saturated adsorption capacity of 23.86 mg g(-1), surpassing those of all previously reported metal oxides. Furthermore, 2U-La0.8MnO3 demonstrated nearly 100% removal of Hg-0 across a wide temperature range (40-250 degrees C), along with low apparent activation energy and excellent sulfur resistance. Characterization studies manifested that the introduction of urea and non-stoichiometric co-modulation induced the simultaneous formation of abundant La defects and O vacancies (OVs), boosting the surface reactive oxygen species and Lewis acid sites, decreasing the particle size, and improving the pore structure and surface area. Product analysis revealed that almost all Hg-0 was oxidized and chemisorbed as HgO, with no Hg(2+ )escaping. Characterization combined with theoretical calculations elucidated that the co-modulation process altered the Hg-0 removal mechanism from Eley-Rideal to Langmuir-Hinshelwood: OVs dominated the generation of surface adsorbed oxygen (Oads) via splitting O-2, and Lewis acid was the primary site for Hg-0 adsorption, followed by the reaction with Oads to form HgO. Additionally, the co-modulation method significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of O-2 + Hg-0 and dramatically reduced the reaction energy barrier. This dual-regulation method provides an innovative strategy for preparing adsorbents with ultra-high Hg-0 trapping capacity.

TI Accelerative Solid-State Oxidation Behaviour of Amorphous and Partially
   Crystalline Venetoclax
SO AAPS PHARMSCITECH
AB There is a growing focus on solid-state degradation, especially for its relevance in understanding interactions with excipients. Performing a solid-state degradation of Venetoclax (VEN), we delve into VEN's stability in different solid-state oxidative stress conditions, utilizing Peroxydone (TM) complex and urea peroxide (UHP). The investigation extends beyond traditional forced degradation scenarios, providing insights into VEN's behavior over 32 h, considering temperature and crystallinity conditions. Distinct behaviors emerge in the cases of Peroxydone (TM) complex and UHP. The partially crystalline (PC-VEN) form proves more stable with Peroxydone (TM), while the amorphous form (A-VEN) shows enhanced stability with UHP. N-oxide VEN, a significant degradation product, varies between these cases, reflecting the impact of different oxidative stress conditions. Peroxydone (TM) complex demonstrates higher reproducibility and stability, making it a promising option for screening impurities in solid-state oxidative stress scenarios. This research not only contributes to the understanding of VEN's stability in solid-state but also aids formulators in anticipating excipient incompatibilities owing to presence of reactive impurities (peroxides) and oxidation in the final dosage form.

TI Bacteria-induced internal carbonation of reactive magnesia cement
SO CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS
AB With lower calcination temperature, reactive magnesia cement (RMC) can be a potential alternative to the Portland cement. However, RMC concrete requires accelerated carbonation curing from external sources which greatly hinder the wider applications of RMC. This study proposed a bacteria-based method for the strength gain of RMC through internal carbonation. Sporosarcina pasteurii, urea, and yeast extract were used as a carbonation agent for internal carbonation of RMC pastes. Results showed that the flowability of the fresh bio-RMC paste increased by 20% while the initial setting time remained unchanged. Besides serving as the CO2 provider, urea can also function as superplasticizer to reduce the water demand of the bio-RMC pastes. The resulting bio-RMC pastes showed a continuous strength gain with time, demonstrating the feasibility of bacteria-induced internal carbonation of RMC. Microstructure analysis revealed abundant formation of hydrated magnesium carbonates in the bioRMC pastes, which is responsible for the strength gain of the bio-RMC pastes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI N-doped carbon achieved by pyrolyzing urea and active carbon for the
   capacitive deionization coupled PMS oxidation system
SO DESALINATION
AB Tetracyclines are among the most widely used antibiotics, and the saline organic wastewater generated during their production has caused serious environmental problems. Thus, it is imperative to develop effective methods for treating this antibiotic wastewater. In this study, we examined the structural characteristics and electrochemical performance of nitrogen-doped carbon materials and assessed the effects of nitrogen doping on the performance of a peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-coupled membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) system for removing tetracycline (TC) and salt. Having optimized the carbonization temperature and system operating parameters, we observed that in response to an increase in carbonization temperature, there was an increase in the abundance of surface functional groups in the material, which promoted the ion migration capacity of the electrode and PMS activation sites. In addition, we observed that nitrogen doping can alter the electrical properties of carbon materials, provide a larger number of adsorption sites, and enhance the interactions between carbon structures and salt ions, thereby improving material properties. Under optimal operating conditions, the salt adsorption and tetracycline removal rates reached 30.2 % and 61.8 %, respectively. Our findings in this study provide a feasible method for the treatment of saline tetracycline wastewater.

TI Influence of the Fuel/Oxidant Ratio on the Elaboration of Binary Oxide
   Catalyst by a Microwave-Assisted Solution Combustion Method
SO ENERGIES
AB Three series of binary metal oxide catalysts containing Ni, Cu, or Co oxides were prepared, fully characterized and tested in CO oxidation. The catalysts, with a constant transition metal loading of 10 wt%, were prepared from metal nitrates and urea mixtures by a microwave-assisted solution combustion method. The RV/OV ratio, corresponding to the stoichiometry of the reactants, calculated from their elemental oxidizing and reducing valences, was varied. In order to modify the redox character of the synthesis medium from the quantity of urea; an excess of urea was used for attaining reducing conditions, while a deficit of urea shifted the medium to oxidizing conditions. Three RV/OV ratios (0.9, 1.0, and 1.1) were selected to elaborate the different binary metal oxide catalysts, nine oxide catalysts were synthesized. Then, the influence of the stoichiometry (RV/OV ratio) on the bulk and surface properties of the binary metal oxide catalysts was investigated. Similarly, the influence of the RV/OV ratio on the CO oxidation activity was discussed and the optimal value of RV/OV ratio was identified. The results show that the increasing of the RV/OV ratio from 0.9 to 1.1, particularly in Ni- and Co-containing catalysts, induces stronger metal-aluminum interactions, in the form of aluminates phases, and that are correlated to the dramatic reduction of the CO oxidation activity. The best physicochemical properties and highest catalytic activities were achieved with the catalysts prepared in redox systems stoichiometrically balanced (RV/OV = 1). The Cu-containing catalysts presented the best catalytic activities in CO oxidation.

TI CoFe-Layered Double Hydroxide Needles on

   as Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation of Organic Chemicals
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Electrochemical water splitting prompted by organic molecules presents a competitive prospect for implementing energy-efficient hydrogen evolution and alleviating organic-rich water pollution. In this work, we fabricated a heterojunction of CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) needles on MoS2/Ni3S2/nickel foam (NF) nanoarrays (CoFe LDH/MoS2/Ni3S2/NF) by forming a Schottky interface and a p-p heterojunction interface. The prepared CoFe LDH/MoS2/Ni3S2/NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic activities with low potentials to drive 50 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 0.098 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 1.507 V vs RHE), urea oxidation reaction (UOR, 1.460 V vs RHE), and ethanol oxidation reaction (ETOR, 1.484 V vs RHE). Meanwhile, the electrode can maintain robust stability in these reactions. The enhanced electrocatalytic activities result from the increased active sites and the acceleration of charge transfer caused by the built-in electric fields. Moreover, the prepared catalyst also exhibits remarkable catalytic performance in two-electrode electrocatalytic systems of KOH, KOH assisted by urea, and KOH assisted by polylactic acid. This work offers a rational method for designing efficient electrocatalysts via combining heterojunctions to effectively generate hydrogen energy and treat organic pollutants.

TI Ex-situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopic investigation of
   NiCo2O4 annealed in different gases for hydrogen
   generation by electrolysis of urea
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Electrochemical and ex-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) measurements of NiCo2O4 that have been annealed in different gases (Ar and air) were made to evaluate the efficiency of its electrocatalysis of hydrogen generation by the electrolysis of urea. The electrochemical and XAS measurements demonstrated that NCO-Ar contain significant amounts of Co2+ in octahedral coordination was more favorable than NCO-air for urea electrolysis owing to the effective exposure of electrochemical active sites to participate in the Faradic redox reaction. Further insight into the electrocatalytic mechanism of NiCo2O4-based materials during urea electrolysis was obtained using ex-situ soft XAS. The results of ex-situ soft XAS revealed that the variation of the octahedral and tetrahedral coordinations of Co2+ in NCO-Ar and NCO-air importantly contributes to electrocatalytic behavior. NCO-Ar exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the Co redox couples in a repetitive cycling process owing to the creation of highly efficient active sites (octahedral Co2+). This study presents importantly x-ray spectroscopic determination of the change in electronic structure of catalyst for hydrogen production. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI Palladium Supported on an Amphiphilic Triazine-Urea-Functionalized
   Porous Organic Polymer as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for
   Electrochemical Sensing of Rutin in Human Plasma
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Metal nanoparticle-containing porous organic polymers have gained great interest in chemical and pharmaceutical applications owing to their high reactivity and good recyclability. In the present work, a palladium nanoparticle-decorated triazine-urea-based porous organic polymer (Pd@TU-POP) was designed and synthesized using 1,3-bis(4-aminophenyl)urea with cyanuric chloride and palladium acetate. The porous structure and physicochemical properties of the electrode material PdpTU-POP were observed using a range of standard techniques. The Pd@TU-POP material on the electrode surface showed superior sensing ability for rutin (RT) because the Pd dispersion facilitated the electrocatalytic performance of TU-POP by reducing the overpotential of RT oxidation dramatically and improving the stability significantly. Furthermore, TU-POP provides excellent structural features for loading Pd nanoparticles, and the resulting Pd@TU-POP exhibited enhanced electron transfer and outstanding sensing capability in a linear range between 2 and 200 pM having a low detection value of 5.92 x 10(-12) M (S/N = 3). The abundant porous structure of Pd@TU-POP not only provides electron transport channels for RT diffusion but also offers a facile route for quantification sensing of RT with satisfactory recoveries in aqueous electrolyte containing human plasma and red wine. These data reveal that the synthetic Pd@TU-POP is an excellent potential platform for the detection of RT in biological samples.

TI C and N doped nano-sized TiO2 for visible light
   photocatalytic degradation of aqueous pollutants
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL NANOSCIENCE
AB A facile large scale synthesis of high surface area anatase TiO2 nano material has been carried out by using the solution combustion synthesis with very widely available urea as fuel. The as-obtained puffy powder of anatase TiO2 was characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques in order to analyse the structural, optical and surface properties of the synthesised material. Diffuse UV-vis spectroscopic data show a red shift in absorption spectra which may be attributed to the possible energy levels added in between the band edges of TiO2 due to the C and N doping as confirmed by XPS. Photocatalytic activity of the catalyst was assessed by the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation. The effect of an electron acceptor in order to maximise the electron trapping for further inhibiting exciton recombination and thereby enhancing the oxidation of dyes has also been studied by using peroxomono sulphate(PMS) as the electron acceptor.

TI Ag engineered NiFe-LDH/NiFe2O4 Mott-Schottky
   heterojunction electrocatalyst for highly efficient oxygen evolution and
   urea oxidation reactions
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Efficient and durable electrocatalysts with sufficient active sites and high intrinsic activity are essential for advancing energy-saving hydrogen production technology. In this study, a Mott-Schottky heterojunction electrocatalyst with Ag nanoparticles in-situ grown on NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH)/NiFe2O4 nanosheets (Ag@NiFe-LDH/NiFe2O4) were designed and successfully synthesized through a hydrothermal process and subsequent spontaneous redox reaction. The in-situ growth of metallic Ag on semiconducting NiFe-LDH/ NiFe2O4 triggers a strong electron interaction across the Mott-Schottky interface, leading to a significant increase in both the intrinsic catalytic activity and the electrochemical active surface area of the heterojunction electrocatalyst. As a result, the Ag@NiFe-LDH/NiFe2O4 demonstrates impressive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline KOH solution, achieving a low overpotential of 249 mV at 100 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 42.79 mV dec- 1. When the self-supported Ag@NiFe-LDH/NiFe2O4 is coupled with the Pt/C electrocatalyst, the alkaline electrolyzer reaches a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a cell voltage of only 1.460 V. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in-situ Raman analysis reveal that the Ni(Fe)OOH is the possible active phase for OER in the catalyst. In addition, when employed for UOR catalysis, the Ag@NiFe-LDH/ NiFe2O4 also displays intriguing activity with an ultralow potential of 1.389 V at 50 mA cm-2. This work may

TI Wet-chemistry topotactic synthesis of bimetallic iron-nickel sulfide
   nanoarrays: an advanced and versatile catalyst for energy efficient
   overall water and urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB In this study, we report that bimetallic iron-nickel sulfide nanowall arrays supported on nickel foam (Fe-11.1%-Ni3S2/Ni foam) via wet-chemistry conversion from its LDH precursor could perform the function of a high-performance and versatile catalyst toward both overall water and urea electrolysis in a base. Its efficiency for overall water splitting is superior to those of most newly reported transition metal-based bifunctional catalysts, with small cell voltage of 1.60 V needed to gain 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, this electrode also performs well toward the UOR, requiring very small potentials of 0.284 and 0.372 V (vs. SCE) to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. After replacing the anodic OER with the UOR that has a much lower thermodynamic voltage, this urea-mediated water-electrolysis device could sustain an overall current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of only 1.46 V (140 mV less than that for its urea-free counterpart) for over 20 h. Also, battery-and solar energy-assisted overall water and urea electrolysis devices were built to explore the viability of future less-energy-intensive and large-scale hydrogen generation.

TI Nitrogen-incorporated iron phosphosulfide nanosheets as efficient
   bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy-saving hydrogen evolution
SO IONICS
AB Urea-assisted hydrogen evolution is a promising alternative to conventional water splitting for producing hydrogen with reduced energy consumption. Therefore, the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts to be used in urine-mediated electrolyzers for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is required. In this work, nitrogen-doped iron phosphorus trisulfide (FePS3) nanosheets were prepared, which performance surpassed platinum on carbon electrocatalysts at large current densities above 140 mA cm(-2), exhibiting excellent HER performance. A low overpotential of 756 mV was observed for UOR to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When configured for hydrogen production, the urea electrolysis cell delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.26 V, which is about 0.28 V lower than in conventional water electrolysis. The development of FePS3-based materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts provides a new approach enabling energy-saving hydrogen production.

SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Herein, a N-doped carbon-supported Co and NiFe LDH (Co-NC@NiFe LDH) array was developed, which demonstrated superior catalytic activities for both the OER and UOR in an alkaline medium. The intrinsic electron transfer is effectively regulated by the construction of a built-in electric field, which reduces the reaction energy barrier and consequently leads to a significant enhancement in electrocatalytic activity.
   In this study, Co-NC and NiFe LDH composites with different work functions were successfully synthesized, and the impact of a built-in electric field on enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe LDH was comprehensively investigated.

TI In situ topologically induced metastable phase Ni/r-Ni(OH)2@C
   heterostructures with abundant oxygen vacancies as efficient
   bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy-saving hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB To simultaneously accelerate both sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) kinetics, strongly coupling of transition metal hydroxides of high UOR activity with the transition metals of low hydrogen adsorption barrier for highly active HER is a promising strategy. Herein, a tractable hydrothermal protocol and a partial in-situ topological reduction strategy are developed to synthesize hcp Ni/r-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets containing abundant oxygen defects with an ultrathin carbon layer, which are utilized as the new bifunctional catalysts for both HER and UOR. As for HER, the surface electronic structure of Ni is optimized by introducing the oxygen defects coupling with hcp Ni with excellent electronic structure, which greatly enhances the dissociation ability of H2O and reduces the Ni-H bond strength, thus acquiring the optimized H* Gibbs free energy ( increment GH*). As for UOR, abundant interfaces and the electron transfer between transition metal hydroxides/transition metal are favorable to regulate the urea adsorption. As expected, the hcp Ni/r-Ni(OH)2/C electrocatalyst shows good activity for HER (70.7 mV @ 10 mA cm-2), UOR (1.36 V @ 10 mA cm-2), and urea electrolysis (1.45 V @ 10 mA cm-2). This facile strategy provides a novel way to design high-performance electrocatalysts towards urea splitting, which can utilize to generate hydrogen as well as eliminate urea in water.

TI Root Growth in Rice (Liangyou 152) Under Alternate Wetting and Drying
   Irrigation and Mixed Application of Polymer-coated and Common Urea
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB Root growth markedly influences crop yield and resource use efficiency. The present study investigated the effects of alternate wetting and drying irrigation (AWD) and the mixed application of controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer (CRNF) and common urea (CU) on the physiological and morphological characteristics of roots and their relationships with grain yield, crop water productivity (CWP), and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Three nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments (100% CU (N1), 60% CRNF + 40% CU (N2), and 100% CRNF (N3)) were applied to rice (N rate = 240 kg ha-1) under conventional flooded irrigation (CI) and AWD conditions. Compared to N1, N2, and N3 increased the length, number, dry weight, surface area, oxidation activity, and zeatin + zeatin riboside, and indole-3-acetic acid contents of the roots at the latter (heading and maturity) stages under both AWD and CI. In the same N compounding mode, AWD provided better root parameters. Although grain yield, CWP, and NUE were positively associated with these root traits at the latter stages of growth, they showed a negative correlation with the root traits at the early (tillering) stage. Additionally, the AWDN2 treatment enhanced the number of panicles per m2, spikelets per panicle, filled grain percentage, and 1000-grain weight, providing the greatest grain yield, CWP, and NUE. The combination of AWD and the mixed application of CRNF and CU can improve root growth and root activity, contributing to high grain yield, CWP, and NUE in rice. The results also provide scientific basis for CRNF management strategy mediates rice yield and resource use efficiency under AWD.

TI Green synthesis and evaluation of dual herb-extracted DHM-AgNPs:
   Antimicrobial efficacy and low ecotoxicity in agricultural and aquatic
   systems
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Uncontrolled applications of weedicide and fertilizer can harm the soil ecology, and most significantly, earthworms are hazardous soil engineers. Thus, we aimed at the toxicity and histopathological alterations in the earthworm Eudrilus euginae following exposure to glyphosate (weedicide), urea (fertilizer), and environmentally friendly dual herb-mixed silver nanoparticles (DHM-AgNPs). The DHM-AgNPs were synthesized using a blend of Alfinia officinarum and Curcuma longa aqueous leaf extracts with 1 mM silver nitrate. The color change from yellow to brown after an hour of incubation was a significant indicator of successful DHM-AgNP synthesis. Characterization of the DHM-AgNPs using UV-Vis spectra indicated a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 430 nm. In addition to FT-IR spectroscopy and XRD analysis, SEM, TEM, and SEM investigations were performed to identify the DHM-AgNPs. The XPS analysis revealed the oxidation state and surface chemical composition, and Ag NP's specific surface area and degree of porosity were measured using BET. Furthermore, different concentrations of urea and glyphosate were administered to Artemia nauplii and E. euginae to assess their toxicity. The mortality rate for E. euginae exposed to a higher urea concentration (10 g/kg of soil) was 100%. In contrast, a % mortality rate of 83% was noted at 0.5 g/kg of soil. The maximum mortality (90 +/- 0.64%) was observed at a 10 mL/kg/L concentration for glyphosate. In contrast, low mortality was noted in E. euginae and A. nauplii exposed with gradient concentrations of DHM-AgNPs compared to glyphosate and urea. As aquaculture and foodborne diseases are widespread, DHM-AgNPs showed significant anti-Vibrio activity against pathogenic Vibrio-related bacteria, inhibiting 80% at 100,100 mu g/L, which is of great concern. This study suggests the potential use of DHM-AgNPs in field aqua and crops culture for eco-friendly pest control and anti-Vibrio activity without causing soil and environmental pollution. Further research is warranted to determine the efficacy, safety, and costeffectiveness of DHM-AgNPs in aqua and agricultural practices.

TI Access to Cyclopropanol via Supply-Centered Synthesis
SO ORGANIC PROCESS RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
AB Access to cyclopropanol is improved by developing a route from highly available cyclopropyl methyl ketone. The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation inserts oxygen between the cyclopropyl and ketone functionalities, and the alcohol is subsequently unmasked by cleaving the ester with an amine. Optimization resulted in high yield (>90% for each step), isolation of volatile and water-soluble cyclopropanol, selection of a peroxide with improved safety profile (urea hydrogen peroxide, UHP), and implementation of continuous flow to handle an exotherm. The urea present in the peroxide unexpectedly enhanced conversion of the ketone to the ester, and the addition of a rheology modifier to a 20 wt % suspension of UHP in DCM facilitated continuous delivery of an otherwise difficult-to-pump slurry.

TI Urea-modified Cu-based materials: Highly efficient and support-free
   adsorbents for removal of H2S in an anaerobic and dry
   environment
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this work, we report a novel urea-modified copper-based material (XUrea@Cu) obtained by directly calci-nating a mixture of urea and copper nitrate. This material enables the efficient purification of H2S under dry and anaerobic conditions. The performance test results showed that the H2S capacity of the optimal adsorbent (2Urea@Cu) could reach 364.2 mg(H2S).g(sorbent)(-1), which is much superior to those of other adsorbents in the literature. Further study demonstrates that the ultra-desulfurization performance of 2Urea@Cu is mainly attributed to the extensive alkaline site, the high concentrations of active oxygen, and the abundance of oxygen vacancy; which are quite effective for capturing H2S (acidic and strong reducibility). Interestingly, the deacti-vation adsorbent (De-2Urea@Cu) is mainly composed of high-purity CuS, which means that the Urea@Cu adsorbent can simultaneously achieve efficient purification of H2S and recovery of sulfur resources since CuS is a valuable product. In addition, in-situ FT-IR and theoretical calculation results indicate that H2S molecules dissociate on the CuO(1 1 1) surface by stepwise dehydrogenation, while S combines with adjacent Cu to form CuS. The consumption of active components (CuO) and the accumulation of reaction products (CuS) are the primary reasons for the deactivation of adsorbents. Considering the simple preparation process, low cost, and excellent H2S adsorption activity, these urea-modified copper-based materials are very promising H2S adsorbents.

AB Pyranoindolizine is a tricyclic structure found in various biologically active compounds, such as camptothecin (CPT) and its derivatives. In the case of CPTs, the chirality at the alpha-position in the alpha-hydroxyl lactone moiety of pyranoindolizine is important for the antitumor activity.

TI Simultaneous absorption of NO and SO2 by combined urea and

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB SO2 and NO emitted from coal-fired power plants have caused serious air pollution in China. In this work, a novel mixed absorbent, Fe(II)EDTA/urea, was employed for simultaneous removal of SO2 and NO in a packed tower, with a corresponding optimal ratio of 0.014mol L-1:5%. The effects of various factors, such as mixed absorbent constitutions, reaction temperature, pH, O-2 concentration, as well as concentrations of SO2 and NO, on simultaneous removal were investigated. The desulfurization efficiency was 95-99% in all tests, whereas denitrification was affected significantly by various conditions. NO removal efficiency decreased increasing oxygen concentration as well as increasing NO concentration. With an increase in temperature, pH, or SO2 concentration, NO removal efficiency increased first and then decreased. Under optimal conditions, SO2 removal efficiency was 100% and NO removal efficiency could exceed 91% within 80 min. The reaction mechanism was speculated according to relevant literature.

TI Catalytic Oxidation of Alcohols over a Nitrogen- and Sulfur-Doped
   Graphitic Carbon Dot-Modified Magnetic Nanocomposite
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB A novel and unique nitrogen- and sulfur-doped graphitic carbon dot (g-CSNCD)-modified magnetic nanocomposite was synthesized through a quasi-chemical vapor deposition method using urea and sulfanilic acid. The abovementioned nanocomposite was then fully characterized. The resulting Fe3O4/g-CSNCDs catalyst served as a potent catalyst for promoting alcohol oxidation in a very selective manner. This study investigated the effect of carbonation of reagents and magnetic nanoparticles on catalytic performance by synthesizing a few controller catalysts. These results confirmed g-CSNCD as effective support. Furthermore, the modification of g-CSNCDs with Fe3O4 nanoparticles was more effective than incorporating them into the catalyst's framework. Notably, Fe3O4 nanoparticles had no effect on the reaction process and increasing catalytic activity. Additionally, not only can Fe3O4/g-CSNCDs catalyze this reaction but it can also demonstrate respectable recyclability and be magnetically recovered and effectively reused 10 successive times.

TI Construction of ternary heterostructured Ag/Ag2O@ZnO@g-C3N4
   nanocomposite as an widened visible light photocatalyst for the organic
   oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS
AB Two dimension g-C3N4 was synthesized by thermal polymerization using mixture urea and melamine. The metal oxide Ag2O and ZnO were loaded to nanolayer of g-C3N4. The composites Ag/Ag2O@ZnO@g-C3N4 were con-structed by Ag2O and ZnO which were defined for p-type and n-type semiconductor to form heterojunctions. The samples were characterized by X ray diffraction(XRD), transmission electron microscopy(TEM), X ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS). The experiment results indicate that Ag2O and ZnO were uniformly loaded to nanolayer of g-C3N4 and heterojunction of Ag/ Ag2O@ZnO@g-C3N4 was constructed. The photocatalytic activity of Ag/Ag2O@ZnO@g-C3N4 was characterized by degradation of methylene blue (MB) under the widened visible light-driven. The photodegradation efficiency of MB was 64.486%, 87.724%, 91.611%, 96.700% and 99.999% over g-C3N4, ZnO@g-C3N4, Ag/Ag2O@g-C3N4, Ag/Ag2O@ZnO@g-C3N4-1 and Ag/Ag2O@ZnO@g-C3N4-2, respectively. The results show that the photocatalytic activity of Ag/Ag2O@ZnO@g-C3N4 was enhanced based on the p-n structure which decreased the recombination rates of photoinduced electron hole between metal oxide and g-C3N4. Finally, photocatalytic mechanism of Ag/ Ag2O@ZnO@g-C3N4 was discussed for ternary heterostructured catalysts.

TI Role of preparation parameters of Cu-Zn mixed oxide catalyst in solvent
   free glycerol carbonylation with urea
SO JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Solvent-free carbonylation of glycerol with urea to glycerol carbonate (GC) was achieved over heterogeneous Cu-Zn mixed oxide catalyst. Cu-Zn catalysts with different ratios of Cu:Zn were prepared using co-precipitation (CP) and oxalate gel (OG) methods. As compared to CuO-ZnO(2:1) catalyst prepared by oxalate gel (OG) method, much higher conversion of glycerol and highest selectivity towards glycerol carbonate (GC) was achieved with CuO-ZnO_CP(2:1) catalyst. Physicochemical properties of prepared catalysts were investigated by using XRD, FT-IR, BET, TPD of CO2 and NH3 and TEM techniques. The effect of stoichiometric ratio of Cu/Zn, calcination temperature of CuO-ZnO catalysts and effect of reaction parameters such as molar ratio of substrates, time and temperature on glycerol conversion to GC were critically studied. Cu/Zn of 2:1 ratio, glycerol-urea 1:1 molar ratio, 145 degrees C reaction temperatures were found to be optimized reaction conditions to achieve highest glycerol conversion of 86% and complete selectivity towards GC. The continuous expel of NH 3 from reaction the mixture avoided formation of ammonia complex with CuO-ZnO catalyst. As a result of this, CuO-ZnO catalyst could be recycled up to three times without losing its initial activity.

TI Age-related cellular changes in the long-lived bivalve A.
   islandica
SO AGE
AB One of the biggest challenges to studying causes and effects of aging is identifying changes in cells that are related to senescence instead of simply the passing of chronological time. We investigated two populations of the longest living non-colonial metazoan, Arctica islandica, with lifespans that differed sixfolds. Of four investigated parameters (nucleic acid oxidation, protein oxidation, lipid oxidation, and protein instability), only nucleic acid oxidation increased with age and correlated with relative lifespan. Nucleic acid oxidation levels increased significantly faster and were significantly higher in the shorter-lived than the longer-lived population. In contrast, neither protein oxidation, lipid oxidation, nor protein stability changed over time. Protein resistance to unfolding stress when treated with urea was significantly lower overall in the shorter-lived population, and lipid peroxidation levels were higher in the longer-lived population. With the exception of nucleic acid oxidation, damage levels of A. islandica do not change with age, indicating excellent cellular maintenance in both populations. Since correlations between nucleic acid oxidation and age have also been shown previously in other organisms, and nucleic acid oxidation accumulation rate correlates with relative age in both investigated populations, nucleic acid oxidation may reflect intrinsic aging mechanisms.

TI Synthesis optimization of rich-urea carbon-dots and application in the
   determination of H2S in rich- and barren-liquids of
   desulphurizing solutions
SO ANALYST
AB In the research of carbon dots (CDs) containing various nitrogen sources, it was first found that urea/citric acid-CDs showed a selective discolouration reaction with sulphide ions. Therefore, by optimizing various synthesis and detection conditions of the CDs determining sulfur ions, such as the raw material ratio, temperature, time, pH, and oxidation atmosphere in the CD synthesis, a discolour CD-probe method for trace-level sulphide ions was developed. The method is environmentally friendly, shows two linear-response ranges in 0.050-1.0 mg L-1 (A = -0.0827c + 0.8366) and 1.0-15 mg L-1 S2- (A = -0.0209c + 0.7587) and can be used for the high and low concentration quantification of sulphide in various wastewaters. Subsequently, in order to realize the separation and detection of sulphide ions in wastewaters or rich- and barren-liquids containing N-methyldiethanolamine and other substances in desulphurizing solutions, an automatic pretreatment system was also established.

TI Co3O4 particles grown over nanocrystalline
   CeO2: influence of precipitation agents and calcination
   temperature on the catalytic activity for methane oxidation
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Crystalline cobalt oxides were prepared by a precipitation method using three different precipitation agents, (NH4)(2)CO3, Na2CO3 and CO(NH2)(2). Cobalt oxide nanoparticles corresponding to a Co3O4 loading of 30 wt% were also deposited over high-surface area nanocrystalline ceria by the same precipitation agents. The effect of calcination temperature, 350 or 650 degrees C, on the morphological and structural properties was evaluated. Characterization by BET, XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, H-2-TPR, XPS and NH3-TPD was performed and the catalytic properties were explored in the methane oxidation reaction. The nature of the precipitation agent strongly influenced the textural properties of Co3O4 and the Co3O4-CeO2 interface. The best control of the particle size was achieved by using CO(NH2)(2) that produced small and regular crystallites of Co3O4 homogeneously deposited over the CeO2 surface. Such a Co3O4-CeO2 system precipitated by urea showed enhanced low-temperature reducibility and high surface Co3+ concentration, which were identified as the key factors for promoting methane oxidation at low temperature. Moreover, the synergic effect of cobalt oxide and nanocrystalline ceria produced stable full conversion of methane in the entire range of investigated temperature, up to 700-800 degrees C, at which Co3O4 deactivation usually occurs.

SO CHEMICAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE UNIVERSITIES-CHINESE
AB Nitrogen-doped carbon materials with well developed pore structure and high nitrogen content were prepared from cellulose and characterized by N-2 adsorption, element analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, then applied to SO2 removal. The role of nitrogen-containing groups in the desulfurization was studied by changing the calcination temperature and amount of urea. It is found that the nitrogen-containing groups, especially pyridine nitrogen, could effectively improve the activity of carbon materials towards SO2 removal. Such a result is closely related to the pyridine nitrogen enhancing SO2 adsorption and its oxidation to SO3.

TI A critical look at alternative oxidation reactions for hydrogen
   production from water electrolysis
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Electrocatalytic water splitting using renewable electricity is widely recognized as a promising approach toward sustainable green hydrogen production. However, the energy efficiency of conven-tional water electrolysis is hindered by sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction. Several innovative strategies have been proposed to replace the anodic reaction, aiming toward lowering the levelized cost of hydrogen. One of the most notable emerging strategies is to pursue alternative oxidation reactions. Here, we take a critical look at an array of alternative oxidation re-actions. The analysis includes reactions that target wastewater con-taminants as sacrificial reagents. Additionally, processes that boast the dual functionality of biomass sourcing and consequent partial reforming to hydrogen and value-added byproducts are examined. The critique offered herein paints a clear picture of current chal-lenges and bottlenecks of alternative oxidation reactions as an approach toward meeting industrial hydrogen production needs. Further, key technical perspectives are provided with the aim of advancing the application of alternative oxidation reactions.

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Nano Ag/ZnO is successfully synthesized by a new simple and low cost method employing Zn(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O, AgNO3, and urea. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), adsorption/desorption porosimetry (BET) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the catalyst. The amount of Ag loading on ZnO (9.276 x 10(-5), 7.391 x 10(-5), 3.632 x 10(-5), and 3.286 x 10(-5) mol%) was determined by induced coupled plasma (ICP). The resulting ZnOsupported Ag nanoparticles efficiently catalyzed the oxidation reactions of alkyl-substituted benzenes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a cheap and environmentally friendly oxidant under solvent-free conditions. This catalytic reaction gave good to excellent yield of products by using mild reaction conditions and no additives were employed during the reaction.

TI Evaluating the impact of anodic oxidation reactions on water splitting
   using Prussian blue analog-derived metal-(oxy)hydroxides
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Herein, we have evaluated the performance of Prussian blue analog (PBA)-derived Fe-Co(O)OH for the anodic oxidation of a series of organic and inorganic compounds (substituted benzyl alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, substituted benzyl amines, phenol, urea, and hydrazine). The effect of different anodic oxidation reactions (AORs) on the production of cathodic H-2, generation of value-added products, and requirement of potential for the electrochemical process has been considered. Special attention has been provided to achieve an industrial-scale current density for AORs avoiding the interference from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and produce value-added chemicals with a faradaic efficiency (FE) > 90%. Fe-Co(O)OH achieved industrial-scale current density for all AORs without any interference from the OER. Among all the AORs, hydrazine oxidation was found to be suitable in terms of required potential and hydrogen production while the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) and benzyl amine (BAm) led to the most promising performance for value-added product formation. The anodic BA (BAm) oxidation achieved 400 mA cm(-2) current density at 1.47 V (1.49 V) vs. RHE with 100% selectivity for benzoic acid (FE = 98.3 +/- 1.1%) and cyanobenzene (FE = 97.5 +/- 1.2%). Moreover, the replacement of the OER with AORs improved the H-2 evolution efficiency significantly. The XAS study also showed the modulated electronic and atomic structure of the electrocatalyst after AORs.

TI Highly Efficient Performance and Conversion Pathway of Photocatalytic NO
   Oxidation on SrO-Clusters@Amorphous Carbon Nitride
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB This work demonstrates the first molecular-level conversion pathway of NO oxidation over a novel SrO-clusters@amorphous carbon nitride (SCO-ACN) photo catalyst, which is synthesized via copyrolysis of urea and SrCO3. The inclusion of SrCO3 is crucial in the formation of the amorphous carbon nitride (ACN) and SrO clusters by attacking the intralayer hydrogen bonds at the edge sites of graphitic carbon nitride (CN). The amorphous nature of ACN can promote the transportation, migration, and transformation of charge carriers on SCO-ACN. And the SrO clusters are identified as the newly formed active centers to facilitate the activation of NO via the formation of Sr-NO delta(+), which essentially promotes the conversion of NO to the final products. The combined effects of the amorphous structure and SrO clusters impart outstanding photocatalytic NO removal efficiency to the SCO-ACN under visible-light irradiation. To reveal the photocatalytic mechanism, the adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation of NO over CN and SCO-ACN are analyzed by in situ DRIFTS, and the intermediates and conversion pathways are elucidated and compared. This work presents a novel in situ DRIFTS-based strategy to explore the photocatalytic reaction pathway of NO oxidation, which is quite beneficial to understand the mechanism underlying the photocatalytic reaction and advance the development of photocatalytic technology for environmental remediation.

TI Valorisation of waste chicken feathers: Optimisation of keratin
   extraction from waste chicken feathers by sodium bisulphite, sodium
   dodecyl sulphate and urea
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Extraction of keratin from keratinous waste materials, such as chicken feathers, has been identified as the favourable approach in beneficiation of this biomass. The chemical extractions of keratin by reducing agents are usually preferred because the process is much faster than its counterpart, oxidation extraction. One such reduction extraction is the use of a mixture of sodium bisulphite, sodium dodecyl sulphate and urea. There are at least five factors that may affect the keratin extraction process and its final properties when using this extraction. Even though this extraction method is often used, the effects of its independent variables have not been studied; as a result, the effects of independent variables cannot be fully linked to the extraction process and final keratin properties. Therefore, this study aimed to optimise the extraction of keratin from waste chicken feathers using sodium bisulphite, sodium dodecyl sulphate and urea. The optimisation was statistically performed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) linked with Box-Behnken Design. After screening the independent variable using one factor at a time method, the concentration of sodium bisulphite, concentration of sodium dodecyl sulphate, reaction temperature and reaction time were chosen for the study. Twenty-nine experiments were statistically designed and executed, and their results were used to analyse the effects of all the independent variables in order to optimise the extraction process. The reaction temperature was found to be the most significant factor, while the concentration of sodium dodecyl sulphate was the most insignificant factor of this extraction process. Independent variables significance order was reaction temperature > reaction time > concentration of NaHSO3 > concentration of NaC12H25SO4. The designed reduced cubic model was significant and was used to predict the protein yield from the keratin extraction using sodium bisulphite.

TI Amide and Urea Based Solvents for Li-O2 Batteries. Part II:
   Evaluation of Decomposition Pathways Using Density Functional Theory
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Potential decomposition mechanisms are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) for a set of amide and urea solvents. Reaction energies and barriers are reported for proton and hydrogen abstraction, and preferred abstraction sites are identified. The N-H bond of secondary amides and the a-hydrogen atoms are more susceptible to proton abstraction than other sites in the solvent molecules. Additionally, hydrogen abstraction is more favorable at the N-alkyl substituents as well as a-hydrogen atoms that result in the formation of secondary and tertiary radicals. All proton abstraction energies are sensitive to the presence of a coordinating Li+, but the hydrogen abstraction energies do not depend on the presence of a Li+. The stabilization due to the presence of Li+ is most pronounced for sites near the carbonyl group where the Li+ interacts with the lone pair of electrons formed by proton abstraction and the carbonyl O atom. The initial steps of a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation type mechanism are also examined. Barriers for these initial steps are significantly lower if HO2- is the oxidant compared to LiO2-. A comparison to our previously reported experimental results indicates that no single reaction could be identified as the rate-limiting step that would predict the performance of this set of solvents in Li-O-2 batteries.

TI Photo-on-Demand In Situ Synthesis of N-Substituted Trichloroacetamides
   with Tetrachloroethylene and Their Conversions to Ureas, Carbamates, and
   Polyurethanes
SO ACS OMEGA
AB N-substituted trichloroacetamides (NTCAs), which serve as blocked isocyanates, were synthesized in similar to 97% yields by in situ photo-on-demand trichloroacetylation of amines with tetrachloroethylene (TCE). The reactions were performed by photo -irradiation of TCE solutions containing an amine under O2 bubbling over 70 degrees C with a low-pressure mercury lamp. TCE underwent photochemical oxidation to afford trichloroacetyl chloride having high toxicity and corrosivity, which then reacts in situ with the amine to afford NTCA. Compared with conventional NTCA synthesis with hexachloroacetone, the present reaction has the advantage of being widely applicable to a variety of amines, even those with low nucleophilicity such as amides, fluorinated amines, and amine HCl salts. NTCAs could be converted to the corresponding N-substituted ureas and carbamates through base-catalyzed condensation with amines and alcohols, respectively, with the elimination of CHCl3. The reaction may proceed by the initial formation of isocyanate and its subsequent addition reaction with the amine or alcohol. This photochemical reaction also enables the synthesis of fluorinated NTCAs, which accelerate the reactions, and realizes the synthesis of novel fluorinated chemicals including polyurethanes.

TI Effect of Urea Addition on Anatase Phase Enrichment and Nitrogen Doping
   of TiO2 for Photocatalytic Abatement of Methylene Blue
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB TiO2-based materials are commonly employed as photocatalysts for industrial wastewater treatment. The primary reasons of employing TiO2 include cost effectiveness, ready availability, eco-friendliness, non-toxic behavior, and exceptional resistance towards photo-corrosion. However, the wider band gap of pure TiO2 restricts its performance because of its optical absorption of solar light to the ultraviolet (UV) region only, and to some extent of photo-excited charge recombination. In the present work an attempt is made to develop a facile synthesis approach by using urea, a cheap chemical precursor, to form nitrogen doped TiO2 with the key objective of extended light absorption and thus enhanced photocatalytic performance. It was also observed that the urea-induced anatase phase enrichment of TiO2 is another key factor in promoting the photocatalytic performance. The photocatalysts prepared by varying the amount of urea as a nitrogen dopant precursor, are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) to evaluate their crystallinity, morphology, functional groups, and charge separation properties, respectively. Moreover, the surface area was also estimated by physicochemical adsorption. The maximum nitrogen-doped sample yielded >99% photodegradation efficiency of methylene blue (MB) dye-simulated wastewater as compared to a pure TiO2 sample which exhibited 6.46% efficiency. The results show that the simultaneous factors of nitrogen doping and anatase phase enhancement contributes significantly towards the improvement of photocatalytic performance.

TI Genetics of enzymatic dysfunctions in metabolic disorders and cancer
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Inherited metabolic disorders arise from mutations in genes involved in the biogenesis, assembly, or activity of metabolic enzymes, leading to enzymatic deficiency and severe metabolic impairments. Metabolic enzymes are essential for the normal functioning of cells and are involved in the production of amino acids, fatty acids and nucleotides, which are essential for cell growth, division and survival. When the activity of metabolic enzymes is disrupted due to mutations or changes in expression levels, it can result in various metabolic disorders that have also been linked to cancer development. However, there remains much to learn regarding the relationship between the dysregulation of metabolic enzymes and metabolic adaptations in cancer cells. In this review, we explore how dysregulated metabolism due to the alteration or change of metabolic enzymes in cancer cells plays a crucial role in tumor development, progression, metastasis and drug resistance. In addition, these changes in metabolism provide cancer cells with a number of advantages, including increased proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and the ability to evade the immune system. The tumor microenvironment, genetic context, and different signaling pathways further influence this interplay between cancer and metabolism. This review aims to explore how the dysregulation of metabolic enzymes in specific pathways, including the urea cycle, glycogen storage, lysosome storage, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial respiration, contributes to the development of metabolic disorders and cancer. Additionally, the review seeks to shed light on why these enzymes represent crucial potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers in various cancer types.

TI Carbon-nitrogen bond formation on Cu electrodes during CO2
   reduction in NO3- solution
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB We demonstrate by Raman Spectroscopy that simultaneous reduction of NO3 - and CO2 on Cu surfaces leads to formation of Cu-C---N-like species, showing Raman bands at 2080 and 2150 cm-1 when associated with reduced or oxidized Cu surfaces, respectively. Furthermore Cu-C---N-like species are soluble, explaining vast restructuring of the Cu surface observed after co-electrolysis of CO2 and nitrate. Oxidation of deposited Cu-C---N-like species results in the formation of NO. Cu-C---N-like species do not form in electrolytes containing i) NH4+ and CO2, or ii) NO3 - and HCOO-, suggesting these likely originate from Cu-CO, the commonly accepted intermediate in electrochemical reduction of CO2, and Cu-NHx species, previously identified in the literature as intermediate towards C-N bond formation. The implications of the previously unresolved formation of Cu-C---N-like species for the development of electrodes and processes for electrochemical formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds, including urea, amines or amides, are briefly discussed.

TI Preparation of Cu-MgO Catalysts via Urea-nitrate Combustion Method and
   Their Catalytic Performance in Vapor Phase Hydrogenation of Furfural
SO CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN CHINESE UNIVERSITIES
AB A series of Cu-MgO catalysts was prepared via a urea-nitrate combustion method, and their catalytic performance was examined in the vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural. Characterization results showed that the amount of urea had important effects on the surface area, Cu dispersion and crystallite size of the catalysts. The Cu-MgO catalyst with a Cu loading of 12.1%(mass fraction) showed higher furfural conversion than the catalyst prepared by coprecipitation. The high activity was attributed to the higher dispersion of Cu on the catalyst surface. These results suggest that the combustion method is an efficient and simple route for the preparation of high activity Cu-MgO catalysts for furfural hydrogenation.

TI Ammonia oxidation at pH 2.5 by a new gammaproteobacterial
   ammonia-oxidizing bacterium
SO ISME JOURNAL
AB Ammonia oxidation was considered impossible under highly acidic conditions, as the protonation of ammonia leads to decreased substrate availability and formation of toxic nitrogenous compounds. Recently, some studies described archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidizers growing at pH as low as 4, while environmental studies observed nitrification at even lower pH values. In this work, we report on the discovery, cultivation, and physiological, genomic, and transcriptomic characterization of a novel gammaproteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacterium enriched via continuous bioreactor cultivation from an acidic air biofilter that was able to grow and oxidize ammonia at pH 2.5. This microorganism has a chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle, using ammonia as energy source. The observed growth rate on ammonia was 0.196 day(-1), with a doubling time of 3.5 days. The strain also displayed ureolytic activity and cultivation with urea as ammonia source resulted in a growth rate of 0.104 day(-1) and a doubling time of 6.7 days. A high ammonia affinity (K-m(app) = 147 +/- 14 nM) and high tolerance to toxic nitric oxide could represent an adaptation to acidic environments. Electron microscopic analysis showed coccoid cell morphology with a large amount of intracytoplasmic membrane stacks, typical of gammaproteobacterial ammonia oxidizers. Furthermore, genome and transcriptome analysis showed the presence and expression of diagnostic genes for nitrifiers (amoCAB, hao, nor, ure, cbbLS), but no nirK was identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this strain belonged to a novel bacterial genus, for which we propose the name "Candidatus Nitrosacidococcus tergens" sp. RJ19.

TI In-situ assembly of 2D/3D porous nickel cobalt sulfide
   solid solution as superior pre-catalysts to boost multi-functional
   electrocatalytic oxidation
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB In this work, we fabricated an efficient pre-catalyst based on (Ni, Co)S2 solid solution with hierarchical architecture and high porosity to boost urea oxidation reaction and electrocatalytic oxidation of organic small molecules. The interaction between Ni and Co can optimize the electronic structure, resulting in the improved conductivity and accelerated charge transfer rate. The 2D/3D architecture can enrich more active species and endow the mass and electron transport to facilitate the surface oxidation and the following catalytic process. Post-structure and catalytic characterizations confirm the surface oxidation of (Ni, Co)S2 during the stability test, and the in-situ formed Co(Ni) based (oxy)hydroxides exhibit su-perior catalytic activity and facilitated charge transfer ability. As a result, the optimal (Ni, Co)S2 solid solution pre-catalyst displays facilitated catalytic behavior and good stability for multifunctional electro-catalytic oxidation, in which a high conversion of benzyl alcohol (97.50%), a good selectivity to benzoic acid (93.78%) and a satisfied faraday efficiency (91.86%) can be achieved.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of MateriaMedica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

TI Harvest pitch-based carbon nanosheets by oxidation and in-situ template
   strategy for all-solid-state supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS
AB Transforming coal tar pitch (CTP) into porous carbon nanosheets (PCNS) offers a dual advantage: maximizing the value of CTP while pioneering novel carbon materials. A key challenge in synthesizing pitch -based PCNS lies in the hydrophobic nature and polycondensation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in CTP, limiting the integration of water-soluble additives and the formation of desired pore structures. In this study, oxidation process, commonly used in preparing pitch -based carbon fibers, was introduced into the synthesis pitch -based PCNS to address the aforementioned challenges. Through oxidization modification, hydrophilic functional groups rich in O, N and P were introduced to PAHs, while macromolecules were partially broken down into smaller aromatic compounds. Following oxidation, the carbon nanosheet structure was successfully achieved through co -carbonization of oxidized CTP and urea, during which the structure -directing agent C3N4 was generated in -situ. Moreover, the efficacy of oxidation modification in the formation of nanosheet structures was assessed by comparing the structures of porous carbon derived from CTP both pre- and post -oxidation. In final, pitch -based PCNS were used in supercapacitors. In three -electrode system, capacitance of PCNS attained 331.3 F/ g at 0.5 A/g, and its response speed, capacitance retention rate and ion transfer speed were also excellent. For solid state supercapacitor, its energy density and cycle stability after 10,000 cycles were 8.3 Wh/kg and 92.4%, respectively.

TI A urea-based approach to synthesize single atom iron catalysts for
   catalyzing peroxymonosulfate to degrade antibiotics
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Understanding the role and catalytic mechanism of single atomic catalysts (SACs) in activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and subsequently eliminating antibiotics in environmental water is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. Despite C-N-metal SACs exhibiting excellent performance, their application is constrained by the intricate N-doped pretreatment process and the high cost of carrier materials. To handle these challenges effectively, a new approach, by using molten urea as both solvent and nitrogen source and polyethylene glycol as carbon source, was employed to synthesize the u-Fex-N-C (x = 1, 2, 3) catalysts. In which, uFe1-N-C had achieved an impressive 92 % degradation ratio for oxytetracycline (OTC) and remains unaffected by pH in the range of 3-11. It further exhibited catalytic degradation activity towards a broad spectrum of environmental pollutants, including sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), naproxen (NPX), ofloxacin (OFL), rhodamine B (RhB), and bisphenol A (BPA), and the degradation efficiencies reached 67 %, 83 %, 77 %, 99 %, and 93 %, respectively. According to a series of the characterization, the prepared u-Fe1-N-C possessed a unique FeN4 structure. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical quenching experiments proved that 1O2 and Fe (IV) played a key role in the current reaction system. In-situ Raman and electrically coupled oxidation systems also proved that the non-radical degradation pathway involving electron transfer in the u-Fe1-N-C/PMS system was the primary way for activating PMS. The degradation efficiency of OTC from real water samples still reached 84 %. This work provides a simple and cost-effective strategy for synthesizing SACs, offering promising applied prospects in the field of water treatment and environmental remediation.

TI Preparation of Fe/Co bimetallic oxide loaded hydrophobic & catalytic
   bifunctional membrane and its catalytic performance in sulfite oxidation
SO HELIYON
AB Sulfite oxidation is critical for the stable operation of desulfurization process and the treatment & recovery of desulfurization by-products. The Fe and Co oxides modified super hydrophobic layer was prepared on tubular ceramic membranes using hydrothermal synthesis and surface modifications to realize the combination of the membrane catalysis and membrane aeration. These two oxides were approximately two-layer distributed on the membrane surface, among which the Fe2O3 located in the bottom layer and the Co3O4 located in the upper layer. The catalytic rate of the bifunctional membrane was about 5.8 times than that of the original ceramic membrane, which was decreased with the increasing of Fe/Co ratio and declined after an initial rise with the increase of urea and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. The conjoint effect of Fe and Co could improve the catalytic performance and reduce the dissolution loss of catalyzer. The oxidation rate tended to be constant after a 15 % decrease in 7 times experiments.

TI Preparation and performance of alumina ceramic coating doped with
   aluminum nitride by micro arc oxidation
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB The present work is focused on the preparation and performance of micro arc oxidation (MAO) ceramic coating doped with aluminium nitride (AlN) on 6061 Al alloy. The results reveal that AlN-doped ceramic coatings could be prepared by plasma discharge with AlN powder or urea added into the electrolyte. Although AlN-doped MAO ceramic coatings present more distinct porous features than those without AlN, they achieved excellent thermal conductivity and insulation performance due to the physical properties of AlN. Compared with the uncoated Al substrate, MAO coatings with or without AlN doping all exhibited an improved wear resistance. AlN-doped MAO coating could considerably inhibit the formation of a transfer layer. This alumina ceramic coating doped with AlN is anticipated to be applied in the field of light-emitting diode (LED) aluminum substrate.

TI 3D Cross-Linked Structure of Manganese Nickel Phosphide Ultrathin
   Nanosheets: Electronic Structure Optimization for Efficient Bifunctional
   Electrocatalysts
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB As the important anodic reactions in electrochemical hydrogen production, both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are proved to be the bottleneck needed to be resolved because of their sluggish 4e(-) or 6e(-) transfer process. High-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts are urgently in need to overcome these blocks. In this work, the manganese nickel phosphide nanosheets (MnxNi2-xP) with a three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked structure in situ grown on Ni foam are developed and serve as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward OER and UOR. The experimental and theoretical methods are employed to get a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic behaviors of the obtained samples. Compared with the monometallic phosphide, Ni2P, and commercial RuO2, MnxNi2-xP exhibits superior performance with the lowest overpotential and impressive longevity. MnxNi2-xP requires a small overpotential of 196 mV and an ultralow potential of 1.24 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) during the OER and UOR process, respectively. The theoretical consequences also confirm the benign electronic conductivity and efficient active sites for the OH- adsorption of MnxNi2-xP, reconfirming that MnxNi2-xP can serve as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for both OER and UOR.

TI Greater stimulation of greenhouse gas emissions by stored yak urine than
   urea in an alpine steppe soil from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: A
   laboratory study
SO GRASSLAND SCIENCE
AB Urine deposition by grazing animals, with urea as the major constituent, is an important nitrogen (N) source in grassland ecosystems and may affect the production of three potent greenhouse gases (GHGs): nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). However, owing to the greater chemical complexity of urine, the effect of urine on GHG emissions may differ from that of urea, and this difference has not been well reported. A short-term laboratory study was conducted to examine the influence of stored yak urine and urea at addition rates of 350 and 700 mg N m(-1) soil on GHG emissions at 20 and 60% water holding capacity (WHC) in an alpine steppe soil from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Compared with no N addition, urea led to greater increases in soil ammonium N (NH4+-N) concentrations, while yak urine resulted in a greater increase in soil dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Greater (P < 0.05) cumulative N2O and CH4 emissions occurred under 60% than 20% WHC, but soil moisture content did not affect CO2 emissions (P > 0.05). There were no statistically significant (P > 0.05) differences in N2O or CH4 emissions between the two N-addition rates, regardless of N type. The increases in N2O and CH4 emissions after N addition were greater in the urine than in the urea treatments, particularly under 60% WHC. The average CO2 emissions for the two soil moisture contents in the urine treatments increased with increasing N-addition rate, but the two urea treatments showed similar values to the control. The greater GHG emissions in the stored yak urine treatments were probably due to the existence of intrinsic organic carbon. Our results suggest that fresh yak urine may also possibly cause more GHG losses than urea under equivalent N application rates in alpine steppe soil on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

TI Dual-functioning porous catalysts: robust electro-oxidation of small
   organic molecules and water electrolysis using bimetallic Ni/Cu foams
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB In this work, we report a single-step preparation of porous Ni-based thin layer foams atop a Cu substrate via the facile dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) technique. As-prepared porous Ni-based foams were characterized by various electrochemical measurements, namely, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The prepared Ni foam has a cauliflower morphology, whereas the Ni/Cu foam obtained upon doping with Cu has a dendritic morphology. The latter foam layer possesses a higher exposed electroactive surface area and electrocatalytic performance than the undoped Ni foam, which depends on the percentage of Cu content. Additionally, the porous Ni/Cu foam shows marked performance as a dual catalyst towards cathodic and anodic reactions, i.e., hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), urea oxidation reactions (UORs), and glycerol oxidation reactions (GORs) in an alkaline medium. The co-deposition of Cu within the matrix of the Ni foam increases its intrinsic catalytic activity as evidenced by the enrichment of the Ni surface by electro-active species (catalytic mediators) as well as increasing the dispersion (and thus active surface area) of Ni within the porous foam layer. This Ni/Cu foam catalyst layer requires reduced overall energies of 1.71, 1.46, and 1.44 V to support 10 mA cm(-2) during overall water splitting, urea electrolysis, and glycerol electrolysis, respectively. Oxalate is the main byproduct resulting from glycerol electrolysis as revealed by the FTIR analysis.

TI Post-modification of mesoporous silica with different nitrogenous bases
   for immobilization of manganese porphyrin: synthesis, characterization
   and catalytic activity
SO JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB In this study, SBA15 functionalized by imidazole or pyridine as nitrogenous bases, the novel recoverable catalysts prepared by coordinative anchoring of manganese(III) complex of meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin (MnTPP(OAc)) on the functionalized SBA15 and the hybrid catalysts fully characterized by standard methods. The catalytic efficiency of the supported catalysts was evaluated for the oxidation of sulfides and alkenes with urea hydrogen peroxide and tetrabutylammonium peroxymonosulfate as oxidant. The co-catalyst activity of imidazole and pyridine for the oxidation reactions in the presence of MnTPP(OAc) compared with each other in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Our results demonstrated that the product yields of the oxidation reaction reflect the co-catalytic activities of the nitrogenous donor in the homogeneous systems, but not in heterogeneous one. The attached nitrogen bases showed a relatively similar effect on the catalytic activity of Mn-porphyrin in the oxidation reactions. The main effect of the tethered co-catalyst was observed on the reusability of the supported catalysts.

TI Changes in abundance and composition of nitrifying communities in barley
   (Hordeum vulgare L.) rhizosphere and bulk soils over the growth
   period following combined biochar and urea amendment
SO BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB To understand the effects of biochar and urea on soil N availability and plant growth, we conducted a pot experiment growing barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) under six treatments: control (N0), soil with 30 g kg(-1) biochar (N0B), soil with 0.23 g kg(-1) urea (N1), soil with 0.23 g kg(-1) urea and 30 g kg(-1) biochar (N1B), soil with 0.46 g kg(-1) urea (N2), and soil with 0.46 g kg(-1) urea and 30 g kg(-1) biochar (N2B). The nitrifying community abundance and compositions in rhizosphere and bulk soils were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and amplicon-based Illumina Hiseq sequencing. Adding urea with biochar (N1B) produced the greatest increase in above- and belowground plant biomass, followed by doubling the amount of urea with biochar (N2B); both treatments raised pH (p < 0.001) and lowered extractable N in the rhizosphere (p < 0.05). N1B treatment produced the greatest increase in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) amoA gene copies, presumably because the combined amendment raised soil pH, which favored AOB access to NH4+. Nitrifier sequences were selected after blasting with reported nitrifiers in NCBI (similarity >= 97%). Nitrosospira dominated AOB communities during the plant seedling stage; however, during the mature stage, Nitrosomonas dominated over Nitrosospira and the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) community became diverse. Redundancy analysis indicated that nitrifying community composition was affected by multiple soil properties, including N availability (i.e., exchangeable NH4+ and NO3-) and soil chemistry (i.e., pH, dissolved organic C, and exchangeable base cations). Our research suggests a positive application of combining biochar with urea in improving N bioavailability and promoting plant growth in the acidic soil.

TI Preferential CO Oxidation in H2 over
   Au/La2O3/Al2O3 Catalysts:
   The Effect of the Catalyst Reduction Method
SO CATALYSTS
AB We investigated the influence of the reduction method on the preferential oxidation of CO in H-2 (CO-PROX) over Au/La2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. An Au/La2O3/Al2O3 sample, prepared using deposition-precipitation with urea, was reduced by chemical reduction with NaBH4 or glycerol. Several techniques, such as diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy after CO adsorption (CO-DRIFTS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the catalysts. Additionally, the catalysts were examined by in situ DRIFTS during methanol decomposition. The results reveal that the reduction method affects the average particle size and electronic state of gold, as well as the characteristics of the CO-Au-0 interactions. The best CO-PROX performance was observed for the catalyst chemically reduced using NaBH4 with a NaBH4/Au molar ratio of 35. This catalyst contained gold particles with size of similar to 4 nm, for which the XPS binding energy was lower than that of metallic gold.

TI A biocatalytic method for the chemoselective aerobic oxidation of
   aldehydes to carboxylic acids
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB Herein, we present a study on the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids using three recombinant aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). The ALDHs were used in purified form with a nicotinamide oxidase (NOx), which recycles the catalytic NAD(+) at the expense of dioxygen (air at atmospheric pressure). The reaction was studied also with lyophilised whole cell as well as resting cell biocatalysts for more convenient practical application. The optimised biocatalytic oxidation runs in phosphate buffer at pH 8.5 and at 40 degrees C. From a set of sixty-one aliphatic, aryl-aliphatic, benzylic, hetero-aromatic and bicyclic aldehydes, fifty were converted with elevated yield (up to >99%). The exceptions were a few ortho-substituted benzaldehydes, bicyclic heteroaromatic aldehydes and 2-phenylpropanal. In all cases, the expected carboxylic acid was shown to be the only product (>99% chemoselectivity). Other oxidisable functionalities within the same molecule (e.g. hydroxyl, alkene, and heteroaromatic nitrogen or sulphur atoms) remained untouched. The reaction was scaled for the oxidation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (2 g), a bio-based starting material, to afford 5-(hydroxymethyl)furoic acid in 61% isolated yield. The new biocatalytic method avoids the use of toxic or unsafe oxidants, strong acids or bases, or undesired solvents. It shows applicability across a wide range of substrates, and retains perfect chemoselectivity. Alternative oxidisable groups were not converted, and other classical side-reactions (e.g. halogenation of unsaturated functionalities, Dakin-type oxidation) did not occur. In comparison to other established enzymatic methods such as the use of oxidases (where the concomitant oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes is common), ALDHs offer greatly improved selectivity.

TI Coupling of the electrochemical oxidation (EO-BDD)/photocatalysis
   (TiO2-Fe-N) processes for degradation of acid blue BR dye
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB We report on the successful preparation of Fe-N codoped Titania powders, using TiO2 Degussa P25, salt of Fe (II), and Urea. Modified Titania-based materials were characterized by SEM, EDS, BET, Raman, XRD diffraction and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy measurements. The doping of TiO2 induced a shift in the absorption threshold toward the spectral range, obtaining catalysts with a greater photoactivity than the one of pure Degussa P25. The degradation of 200 mL of a solution with 50 mg L-1 acid blue BR dye in sulfate medium at pH 3.0 has been comparatively studied by electrochemical oxidation using a boron doped diamond anode (EO-BDD), Photocatalysis TiO2-Fe-N, and coupled material of EO-BDD/Photocatalysis TiO2-Fe-N. The solution was slowly degraded by EO-BDD (25%) and single Photocatalysis TiO2-Fe-N because of the low rate of dye degradation and its colored by-products with hydroxyl radicals generated at the BDD anode and catalyst surface from water oxidation (29%), whereas the solution was more rapidly degraded using coupled material of EO-BDD/Photocatalysis TiO2-Fe-N (82%), owing to the additional generation of hydroxyl radicals from the photocatalysis of TiO2-Fe-N and BDD anode.

TI 3D printed photopolymer derived carbon catalysts for enhanced wet
   peroxide oxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this paper, we explore the application of powdered carbon and 3D-printed carbon monoliths prepared by carbonization of a tailored photopolymer. We demonstrate the efficiency of the developed carbonaceous samples in removing paracetamol (PCM) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), used as model contaminants. Our results demonstrate that carbon samples are active in CWPO, and their catalytic activity is significantly improved by applying nitric acid and urea functionalization methods. The characterization results showed the pure carbon nature of the material (no ashes), their unique structure defects proven by Raman (D/G > 1.8), textural properties (S-BET = 291-884 m(2)/g) and their surface chemistry, which was addressed by pHPZC (2.5-7.5), acidity (312-2375 mu mol g(cat)(-1)) and basicity (117-653 mu mol g(cat)(-1)) determination and XPS of highlighted materials (N1s = 0-3.51 at.%, O1s = 7.1-15.3 at.%). Using desorption assays, our study reveals the adsorption role for pollutant degradation by CWPO using carbon monolithic samples. At last, we demonstrated the ability of functionalized 3D-printed carbon monoliths to keep degradation of PCM and total organic carbon (TOC) above 85 % and 80 %, respectively, during 48 h in a continuous flow CWPO system. Sulfamethoxazole degradation in continuous system was also studied to validate the catalyst versatility, achieving 81 % and 79 % pollutant degradation and TOC abatement, respectively, during 48 h on stream. The characterization of the recovered catalyst provides further insights into the absence of structural modifications after the reaction, reinforcing the stability and reusability characteristic of the 3D-printed carbon catalyst.

TI Construction and Progress of Small Molecule-Based Coupled Electrolyzers
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Coupled electrolyzer is a desirable way to realize efficient energy conversion from electricity to chemical energy. Using coupled electrolyzers highly valuable chemicals (e.g., H2, CHxCOO-, nitrile, S, NH3, CO) can be obtained at low voltages, environmental pollutants can be alleviated, and wastewater (e.g., ammonia, urea, hydrazine) can be recycled. They are even helpful to realize the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Compared to traditional chemical methods, small molecule-based coupled electrolyzers are more cost-efficient. This review summarizes state-of-art of coupled electrolyzers, mainly the replacement of oxygen reduction reaction with oxidation reactions of small molecules and their further coupling with cathodic reduction reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), and other reduction reactions of matching small molecules. In terms of oxidation reactions of small molecules, two types of reactions are covered: sacrificial agent oxidation reaction (SAOR) and electrochemical synthesis reaction (ESR). After detailing the design principle of coupled electrolyzers and several oxidation reactions of small molecules, construction, characterization, and performance of coupled electrolyzers are systematically overviewed along with discussion and outline of current challenges and prospects of this appealing strategy.

TI Cu(I)-doped Fe3O4 nanoparticles/porous C composite
   for enhanced H2O2 oxidation of carbamazepine
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Cu(I) doped nano-Fe3O4 were synthesized and loaded on ordered porous carbon materials using a facile co-precipitated. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, HRTEM, FESEM-EDX mapping and N-2 adsorption-desorption. The results showed that the crystal unit cell of Fe3O4 was enlarged due to the implantation of small amount of Cu(I) into the Fe3O4 structure (Fe2.85Cu0.15O4). With increased Cu content, the catalyst was dominated with Cu2O and the Fe3O4 phase disappeared, the catalytic performance of Fe-Cu bimetal oxide became worse. The Cu(I)-Fe3O4/C composite was enriched with Fe(II), Fe(III) and Cu(I) sites. The prepared Cu-Fe bimetal oxide/C composite exhibited higher specific TOF and oxidation efficiency E on carbamazepine oxidation than Fe2.85Cu0.15O4 and Fe3O4. The enhanced catalytic reactivity was attributed to the synergetic effect of surface Fe and Cu species on the H2O2 activation. The dissolved metals induced catalytic reaction at pH 4.5-8.1 was ignorable. Thus, the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 by Cu-Fe3O4/C at near neutral pH was controlled by interface reactions. The CBZ in the close proximity to the interface was attacked by the generated ROS and formed urea, 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and other oxidative products. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Mo2C Cocatalysts Supported Si Nanowire Photoanode for Solar
   Water Oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB In the present work, we fabricated a novel Mo2C/n-Si nanowire (NW) photoanode for solar water oxidation. Herein, the Mo2C nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesised by urea glass route, followed by deposition on the Si NW film, using the facile electrophoretic method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis-DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were used to systematically characterise the crystal structure, absorption properties, chemical composition, and microstructure. It was confirmed that small crystalline Mo2C NPs were uniformly deposited on the surface of Si NW and that high-crystallinity Mo2C NPs were sustained over the Si NW. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity was evaluated in the neutral 0.5 M Na2SO4 as an electrolyte and showed that the Mo2C/Si NW film photoanode exhibits significantly enhanced photocurrent density (J ( SC )) of 1.46 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, briefly marked as V-RHE), compared to that of the bare Si NW (0.37 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE). This can be mainly attributed to the beneficial charge transfer phenomenon in the interface region. Additionally, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Mott-Schottky (M-S) plot revealed that the Mo2C co-catalyst boosts the charge transfer events.

TI Oxyhalogen-Sulfur Chemistry: Kinetics and Mechanism of Oxidation of
   N-acetylthiourea by Aqueous Bromate and Acidified Bromate
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY-SUID-AFRIKAANSE TYDSKRIF VIR CHEMIE
AB The oxidation of N-acetylthiourea (ACTU) by acidic bromate has been studied by observing formation of bromine in excess bromate conditions. The reaction displays an induction period before formation of bromine. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined to be 4:3:4BrO(3)(-) + 3(CH3CO)NH(NH2)C=S + 3H(2)O -> 4Br(-) + 3(CH3CO)NH(NH2)C=O + 3SO(4)(2-) + 6H(+) (A) with a complete desulfurization of ACTU to its urea analogue. In excess bromate conditions the stoichiometry was 8:5: 8BrO(3)(-) + 5(CH3CO)NH(NH2)C=S + H2O -> 4Br(2) + 5(CH3CO)NH(NH2)C=O + 5SO(4)(2-) + 2H(+) (B). Bromine is derived from an extraneous reaction in which bromide fromstoichiometry (A) reacts with excess acidic bromate. The oxidation ofACTUby aqueous bromine gave stoichiometry (C): 4Br(2)(aq)+(CH3CO)NH(NH2)C=S + 5H(2)O -> 8Br(-) + (CH3CO)NH(NH2)C=O + SO42- + 10H(+). Reaction (C) is much faster than reactions (A) and (B), with a lower limit bimolecular rate constant of 2.1 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) such that appearance of bromine signals complete consumption of ACTU. We were unable to trap any intermediate sulfur oxo-acids of ACTU on its oxidation pathway to N-acetylurea. As opposed to other substituted thioureas, none of its intermediates were stable enough to be isolated and detected.

TI N/Se co-doped porous carbon catalyst derived from a deep eutectic
   solvent and chitosan as green precursors: Investigation of catalytic
   activity for metal-free oxidation of alcohols
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Heteroatom-doped porous carbon-based materials with high surface area compared to their metal-based homologs are considered environmentally friendly and ideal catalysts for organic reactions. In this paper, a new method for the convenient fabrication, cost-effective, and high efficiency of nitrogen/selenium co-doped porous carbon-based catalysis (marked as N/SePC-T) was designed. The N/SePC-T catalysts were created from the direct pyrolysis of a eutectic solvent containing choline chloride/urea as the nitrogen-rich carbon source, selenium dioxide as a source of heteroatom and chitosan as a secondary carbon source in different temperatures (T). The efficacy of the carbonization temperature on the pore structure, morphology, and catalytic activity of the N/ SePC-T materials was investigated and displayed, the N/SePC-900 (having a surface area of 562.01 m 2 /g and total pore volume of 0.2351 cm 3 g -1 ) has the best performance. The morphology, structure, and physicochemical properties of N/SePC-900 were characterized using various analyses including XRD, TEM, TGA, FE -SEM, EDX, FT -IR, XPS, and Raman. The optimized N/SePC-900 catalyst indicated excellent catalytic performance in the oxidation of benzylalcohols to corresponding aldehydes in very mild conditions.

AB Ethylenethiourea (ETU) is a toxic degradation product of one class of fungicide which is largely employed in the world, the ethylenebisdithiocarbamates. In this study, ETU was degraded by ozonation enhanced by UV-C light irradiation (O-3/UV-C) in aqueous medium. Degradation experiments were conducted at natural pH (6.8) and neutral pH (7.0, buffered). ETU was promptly eliminated from the reactive medium during ozonation in the presence and absence of light. Within the first few minutes of reaction conducted in natural pH, the pH decreased quickly from 6.8 to 3.0. Results show that ETU mineralization occurs only in the reaction conducted in neutral pH and that it takes place in a higher rate when enhanced by UV-C irradiation. Main intermediates formed during the O3/UV-C experiments in different conditions tested were also investigated and three different degradation mechanisms were proposed considering the occurrence of direct and indirect ozone reactions. At pH 7, ethylene urea (EU) was quickly generated and degraded. Meanwhile, at natural pH, besides EU, other compounds originated from the electrophilic attack of ozone to the sulfur atom present in the contaminant molecule were also identified during reaction and EU was detected within 60 min of reaction. Results showed that ozonation enhanced by UV-C promotes a faster reaction than the same system in the absence of light, and investigation of the toxicity is recommended.

TI Nitrogen Balance after the Administration of a Prolonged-Release Protein
   Substitute for Phenylketonuria as a Single Dose in Healthy Volunteers
SO NUTRIENTS
AB Nitrogen balance is the difference between nitrogen excreted as urea and nitrogen ingested, mainly in proteins. Increased circulating concentrations of amino acids (AA) in the bloodstream are usually associated with proportional increases in the production and excretion of urea. Previously, we reported results from a randomized, controlled, single-dose, crossover trial in healthy adult volunteers (n = 30) (Trial Registration: ISRCTN11016729), in which a Test product (prolonged-release AA mixture formulated with Physiomimic Technology (TM) (PT (TM))) significantly slowed down the release and reduced the peak plasma concentrations of essential AAs compared with a free AA mixture (Reference product) while maintaining essential AA bioavailability. Here, we report an assessment of the nitrogen balance from the same study. The amount of nitrogen contained in plasma AAs, levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (p < 0.0001) and changes in BUN (p < 0.0001) were smaller after the Test product compared with the Reference product. These findings suggest that the production of urea in proportion to systemic AA availability was significantly smaller after the administration of the Test product compared with the Reference product and that the test product conferred the increased utilization of AAs for protein synthesis and reduced their oxidation and conversion to urea. In the clinical setting, it is possible that the effects of PT (TM) observed on the disposition of free AAs in this study may translate to health benefits in terms of physiological body composition and growth if used for the treatment of subjects with phenylketonuria (PKU). Further investigation in patients with PKU is warranted.

TI General Design of Aligned-Channel Porous Carbon Electrodes for Efficient
   High-Current-Density Gas-Evolving Electrocatalysis
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Gas-evolving reactions (GERs) are important in many electrochemical energy conversion technologies and chemical industries. The operation of GERs at high current densities is critical for their industrial implementation but remains challenging as it poses stringent requirements on the electrodes in terms of reaction kinetics, mass transfer, and electron transport. Here the general and rational design of self-standing carbon electrodes with vertically aligned porous channels, appropriate pore size distribution, and high surface area as supports for loading a variety of catalytic species by facile electrodeposition are reported. These electrodes simultaneously possess high intrinsic activity, large numbers of active sites, and efficient transport highways for ions, gases, and electrons, resulting in significant performance improvements at high current densities in diverse GERs such as urea oxidation, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen evolution reactions, as well as overall urea/water electrolyzers. As an example, the carbon electrode decorated with Ni(OH)2 demonstrates a record-high current density of 1000 mA cm-2 at 1.360 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, largely outperforming the conventional nickel foam-based counterpart and the state-of-the-art electrodes.
   A series of aligned-channel carbon electrodes by a general design strategy are developed, which not only facilitates the fast accessibility of liquid reactants and the timely detachment of gaseous products but also possesses a large pore area to accommodate abundant active sites, thus achieving high-performance gas-evolving electrocatalysis at high current densities, including urea oxidation reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. image

TI Influence of nutrients on oxidation of low level methane by mixed
   methanotrophic consortia
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Low-level methane emissions from coal mine ventilation air (CMV-CH4; i.e., 1 % CH4) can significantly contribute to global climate change, and therefore, treatment is important to reduce impacts. To investigate CMV-CH4 abatement potential, five different mixed methanotrohic consortia (MMCs) were established from soil/sediment sources, i.e., landfill top cover soil, bio-solid compost, vegetated humus soil, estuarine and marine sediments. Enrichment conditions for MMCs were as follows: nitrate mineral salt (NMS) medium, pH similar to 6.8; 25 A degrees C; 20-25 % CH4; agitation 200 rpm; and culture period 20 days, in mini-bench-top bioreactors. The enriched cultures were supplemented with extra carbon (methanol 0.5-1.5 %, formate 5-15 mM, and acetate 5-15 mM), nitrogen (nitrate 0.5-1.5 g L-1, ammonium 0.1-0.5 g L-1, or urea: 0.1-0.5 g L-1), and trace elements (copper 1-5 mu M, iron 1-5 mu M, and zinc 1-5 mu M) in different batch experiments to improve low-level CH4 abatement. Average CH4 oxidation capacities (MOCs) of MMCs varied between 1.712 +/- 0.032 and 1.963 +/- 0.057 mg g(-1)DW(biomass) h(-1). Addition of formate improved the MOCs of MMCs, but the dose-response varied for different MMCs. Acetate, nitrate and copper had no significant effect on MOCs, while addition of methanol, ammonium, urea, iron and zinc impacted negatively. Overall, MMCs enriched from marine sediments and landfill top cover soil showed high MOCs which were largely resilient to nutrient supplementation, suggesting a strong potential for biofilter development for industrial low-level CH4 abatement, such as those present in CMV.

TI Bonding state synergy of the NiF2/Ni2P hybrid with
   the co-existence of covalent and ionic bonds and the application of this
   hybrid as a robust catalyst for the energy-relevant electrooxidation of
   water and urea
SO NANOSCALE
AB Among the energy-relevant electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical water and urea oxidation reactions are very significant for solving the increasing energy crisis and environmental pollution. Herein, the NiF2/Ni2P hybrid catalyst, in which covalent and ionic bonds co-existed, was found to be a very active catalyst for these electrochemical reactions occuring during the electrolysis of water. The bonding states of the covalent and ionic bonds were verified by the crystal structure and surface chemical state revealed by spectral analysis. As a bifunctional catalyst for the electrooxidation of water and urea, the NiF2/Ni2P hybrid structure demonstrated higher catalytic activity, kinetics and stability in the catalytic reaction than the individual components NiF2 and Ni2P under the same conditions. Specifically, an overpotential as low as 283 mV could drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction, significantly lower than the overpotential required for the NiF2 (393 mV) and Ni2P materials (342 mV); the maximum current density for urea electrooxidation could reach 157.35 mA cm(-2) at 1.53 V, which was much higher than those of NiF2 (23.55 mA cm(-2)) and Ni2P (102.72 mA cm(-2)). The catalytic performance also outperformed those of the recently reported similar advanced catalysts, and the high performance could be attributed to the highly exposed active sites, rough surface area, excellent charge transfer ability, and especially, the synergistic effects between the covalent and ionic bonds in the catalyst system. Using a commercial Pt/C catalyst as a cathode, the cell potential for urea-assisted water electrolysis could be reduced to 1.5 V to obtain the current density of nearly 40 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode system (Pt/C||NiF2/Ni2P), about 300 mV less than that required for water electrolysis in the general alkaline electrolyte. The current study demonstrates the significance of bonding state synergy in an advanced catalyst for water electrolysis and sheds some light on catalyst development in energy chemistry.

TI High-Energy Proton-Beam-Induced Polymerization/Oxygenation of
   Hydroxynaphthalenes on Meteorites and Nitrogen Transfer from Urea:
   Modeling Insoluble Organic Matter?
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Formation and structural modification of oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oxyPAHs) by UV irradiation on minerals have recently been proposed as a possible channel of PAH transformation in astrochemical and prebiotic scenarios of possible relevance for the origin of life. Herein, it is demonstrated that high-energy proton-beam irradiation in the presence of various meteorites, including stony iron, achondrite, and chondrite types, promotes the conversion of two representative oxyPAH compounds, 1-naphthol and 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene, to complex mixtures of oxygenated and oligomeric derivatives. The main identified products include polyhydroxy derivatives, isomeric dimers encompassing benzofuran and benzopyran scaffolds, and, notably, a range of quinones and perylene derivatives. Addition of urea, a prebiotically relevant chemical precursor, expanded the range of identified species to include, among others, quinone diimines. Proton-beam irradiation of oxyPAH modulated by nitrogen-containing compounds such as urea is proposed as a possible contributory mechanism for the formation and processing of insoluble organic matter in meteorites and in prebiotic processes.

TI Single-atom catalysts: controlled synthesis and dynamic mechanism in
   electrochemical oxygen evolution substitution reactions
SO RARE METALS
AB Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attention in the field of electrocatalysis due to their 100% atomic utilization efficiency, clear active center and adjustable support. The application of SACs to anodic oxygen evolution substitution reactions with high conversion efficiency and selectivity is undoubtedly promising. Therefore, a full understanding of the interactions between metal single-atom active sites and supports, and an in-depth understanding of the active centers and catalytic mechanisms of SACs in the electro-oxidation of small molecules are the keys to the development of high-performance catalysts. This review focuses on the synthesis of different support SACs and the interactions between single atoms and supports at the interface, and introduces the reaction mechanism of SACs in the electro-oxidation of different small-molecule substrates, such as ethanol, urea and hydrazine, with the aim of providing insights and ideas for the design of more efficient and ideal catalysts. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future opportunities in the field.

   oxide production in urea-amended soils
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas and ozone-depleting chemical, continues to increase, due largely to the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. While nitrite (NO2-) is a central regulator of N2O production in soil, NO2- and N2O responses to fertilizer addition rates cannot be readily predicted. Our objective was to determine if quantification of multiple chemical variables and structural genes associated with ammonia (NH3)- (AOB, encoded by amoA) and NO2--oxidizing bacteria (NOB, encoded by nxrA and nxrB) could explain the contrasting responses of eight agricultural soils to five rates of urea addition in aerobic microcosms. Significant differences in NO2- accumulation and N2O production by soil type could not be explained by initial soil properties. Biologically-coherent statistical models, however, accounted for 70-89% of the total variance in NO2- and N2O. Free NH3 concentration accounted for 50-85% of the variance in NO2- which, in turn, explained 62-82% of the variance in N2O. By itself, the time-integrated nxrA:amoA gene ratio explained 78 and 79% of the variance in cumulative NO2- and N2O, respectively. In all soils, nxrA abundances declined above critical urea addition rates, indicating a consistent pattern of suppression of Nitrobacter-associated NOB due to NH3 toxicity. In contrast, Nitrospira-associated nxrB abundances exhibited a broader range of responses, and showed that long-term management practices (e.g., tillage) can induce a shift in dominant NOB populations which subsequently impacts NO2- accumulation and N2O production. These results highlight the challenges of predicting NO2- and N2O responses based solely on static soil properties, and suggest that models that account for dynamic processes following N addition are ultimately needed. The relationships found here provide a basis for incorporating the relevant biological and chemical processes into N cycling and N2O emissions models. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots obtained hydrothermally from citric
   acid and urea: The role of the specific nitrogen centers in their
   electrochemical and optical responses
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The knowledge of how the different types of nitrogen centers affect the electrochemical and optical properties of Nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CDs) is of paramount importance in the design and synthesis of these nanostructures. In fact, from the knowledge of the redox centers of N-CDs it is possible tune their energetic levels in order to realize the suitable matches for the design of opto-electronic, photovoltaic or catalytic devices. Herein we present a study of the electrochemical and the optical responses of N-CDs, obtained by hydrothermal method from citric acid and urea. The main issue is to investigate the role played by the specific nitrogen centers in their redox processes. From the voltammetric responses we showed that the observed oxidation processes of N-CDs involve their graphitic and pyrrolic N-atoms, respectively, while the reduction process regards their protonated pyridinic N-atoms. Then, from spectro-electrochemical determinations, we explained that the oxidation of the graphitic N atoms is a two electron process that gives an N-oxide form through the reaction with a molecule of water and the loss of two protons. Finally we discussed the observed pH-dependence of both the optical and the electrochemical responses of our N-CDs to explain the role played by their pyridinic N-atoms.

TI A urea-modified tryptophan based in situ reducing and stabilizing agent
   for the fabrication of gold nanoparticles as a Suzuki-Miyaura
   cross-coupling catalyst in water
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Urea-modified tryptophan has been used as an in situ reducing and stabilizing agent for the fabrication of gold nanoparticles in water. The tryptophan side chain NH has been used for the reduction of gold ions in HAuCl4 to metallic gold and carboxylic acid functionality helps to stabilize the gold nanoparticles. This was confirmed by a controlled reaction with urea-modified leucine which failed to form any gold nanoparticles. The resultant gold nanoparticles have been characterized by various spectroscopic techniques such as UV-visible spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy and microscopic techniques such as FE-SEM and TEM. Moreover, we have shown that the urea-modified tryptophan stabilized gold nanoparticles catalyze the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The gold nanoparticle catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura crosscoupling reaction between 4-bromobenzoic acid and phenylboronic acid in water provides 92% yield in 40 minutes. The high efficiency exhibited by the gold nanoparticle catalyst was effectively translated to a large number of Suzuki-Miyaura reactions between halides with phenylboronic acid. The results may inspire further research on gold nanoparticles catalysis in water.

TI Ni3S2/MxSy-NiC
   o LDH (M = Cu, Fe, V, Ce, Bi) heterostructure nanosheet arrays on Ni
   foam as high-efficiency electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic overall
   water splitting and urea splitting
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Here, we synthesized a series of Ni3S2/MxSy-NiCo LDH materials (M = Cu, Fe, V, Ce, and Bi) by a two-step hydrothermal method for the first time, which display excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) properties. M (M = Cu, Fe, V, Ce, and Bi) ions were firstly doped into NiCo LDH to change the original electronic structure and enhance the activity of the LDH. Then, Ni3S2 and MxSy were introduced by sulfurization of the Ni support and doping cations, and the combination of Ni3S2, MxSy and NiCo-LDH improved the electron transfer rate and activity of the original material. With Ni3S2/Bi2S3-NiCo LDH/NF as anode and Ni3S2/CuS-NiCo LDH as cathode, an electrolytic cell can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.622 V with outstanding durability for overall water splitting. In addition, with Ni3S2/Bi2S3-NiCo LDH/NF as both electrodes, it can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.56 V with outstanding durability for overall urea splitting, which is better than that of the overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the superior electrocatalytic activity can be explained by the water adsorption energy being optimized and enhanced conductivity. This study provides a new idea for improving the catalytic activity and stability of non-noble metals instead of noble metals.

TI Catalytic behavior of gold nanoparticles supported on a
   TiO2-Al2O3 mixed oxide for CO oxidation
   at low temperature
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The present work highlights the versatility of a TiO2-Al2O3 mixed oxide bearing highly dispersed gold nanoparticles that was applied in the CO oxidation reaction at room temperature. The TiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2-Al2O3 supports were synthesized by the sol-gel method, while gold nanoparticles were added by the deposition-precipitation with urea method using a theoretical Au loading of 2 wt.%. A promotional effect of the TiO2-Al2O3 support on the activity of gold catalysts with respect to TiO2 and Al2O3 was observed; Au/TiO2-Al2O3 showed outstanding CO oxidation, being active from 0 degrees C and stable throughout a 24-h test. As for the alumina content (5, 10, and 15 wt.%) in TiO2 , it improved the textural properties by retarding the crystal growth and anatase-rutile phase transformation of TiO2, suppressing the deposition of carbon on the catalyst surface and stabilizing the Au nanoparticles even at high temperatures. Gold was highly dispersed with nanoparticle sizes ranging from 1 to 2 nm when H(2 )was used to treat thermally the Au/TiO2-Al2O3 , Au/TiO2, and Au/Al2O3 materials. In addition, the XPS technique helped elicit that Au-0 and Au1+ boosted their interaction with the TiO2, Al2O3 , and TiO2-Al2O3 supports by means of charge transfer, which resulted in outstanding CO oxidation activity from 0 degrees C. Likewise, the key factors that control the peculiar catalytic performance in the CO oxidation reaction are discussed, which represents a step forward in the versatility behavior of gold catalysts supported on mixed oxide catalysts.

TI Organic Carbon and Nitrogen Amendment Prevents Oxidation of Subsurface
   of Sulfidic Soil under Aerobic Conditions
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB Managing the surface soil (0-10 mm) is important for microbes and benthic organisms that regulate various ecological services, e.g. regulation of soil or water chemistry, oxygenation, and temperature. In this study, the importance of soil carbon and nitrogen in the subsurface (10-80 mm) of sulfidic soil was investigated following the addition of complex and simple carbon and nitrogen sources. The purpose was to assess the effects of carbon and nitrogen on sulfidic soil chemistry (i.e. redox and pH) so as to establish alternative management strategies to prevent oxidation of the surface soil. Aerobic and anaerobic soil moisture conditions were considered as the most prevalent under any surface environment. The results showed that the presence of both carbon and nitrogen, either under aerobic or anaerobic soil condition, is important to prevent oxidation. Organic matter of plant material origin is complex and contains both carbon and nitrogen; this highly reduces the soil redox and increases the pH, even under the aerobic soil conditions. Simple metabolic substrate like glucose acidified the soil and ammonium had no significant effect on soil pH compared to compounds like urea containing both carbon and nitrogen having the opposite effects. The results of this study have implications for management of the surface soil, which is important for various surface environment chemistry and ecosystem services.

TI A Carbon Catalyst Co-Doped with P and N for Efficient and Selective
   Oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural into 2,5-Diformylfuran
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB A newly designed N and P co-doped carbon material has been developed to catalyze the conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandialdehyde (DFF) with unprecedented yield and selectivity and demonstrating a synergistic effect between the heteroatoms. The desired catalyst was first synthesized via a pyrolysis method using urea as the nitrogen and carbon source followed by calcination with phytic acid solution as the phosphorus source. The mass ratio of phytic acid to C(3)N(4)and calcination temperature were varied to investigate their effects on catalyst synthesis and microstructure as well as subsequent catalytic activity in simple reaction systems under oxygen. The effect of reaction conditions on the final HMF conversion and DFF selectivity were also investigated systematically. The P-C-N-5-800 catalyst obtained with the optimized annealing temperature of 800 degrees C and mass ratio of phytic acid/C(3)N(4)of 5 enabled a 99.5 % DFF yield at 120 degrees C for 9 h under 10 bar oxygen pressure, being the highest among any reported metal-free heterogeneous catalyst to date. The excellent performance of P-C-N-5-800 could be ascribed to the synergy between N and P heteroatoms as well as the high content of graphitic-N and the P-C species within the carbon structure. Reusability studies show that the P-C-N-5-800 catalyst was stable and reusable without deactivation. These results strongly suggest that P-C-N-5-800 is a promising catalyst for large-scale production of DFF in a green manner.

   prepared by anodic oxidation: The effect of applied voltage, anodization
   time and amount of nitrogen dopant
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Nitrogen doped TiO2 nanotube arrays were prepared by anodizing Ti foils in an organic electrolyte containing specified amounts of urea as nitrogen precursor. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by analyzing the degradation kinetics of phenol in water. The influence of tubes' length, tubes' surface morphology and amount of nitrogen in the TiO2 lattice on hydroxyl radical formation efficiency, photocatalytic activity and stability in four cycles was investigated. It was found that the photocatalytic activity as well as the charge carrier recombination rate depends on nitrogen concentration and the process parameters. 3.5 mu m-long nanotubes containing 0.34 at.% of nitrogen seems to be favorable in phenol degradation and OH radicals generation under visible light. Comparison of XPS and photocatalytic activity test results shows decrease in phenol degradation efficiency with increasing amount of carbon contaminants on photocatalysts' surface.

TI Soybean molasses increases subcutaneous fat deposition while reducing
   lipid oxidation in the meat of castrated lambs
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB This study aimed to evaluate the effect of including soybean molasses (SM) on performance, blood parameters, carcass traits, meat quality, fatty acid, and muscle (longissimus thoracis) transcriptomic profiles of castrated lambs. Twenty Dorper x Santa In & ecirc;s lambs (20.06 +/- 0.76 kg body weight [BW]) were assigned to a randomized block design, stratified by BW, with the following treatments: CON: 0 g/kg of SM and SM20: 200 g/kg of SM on dry matter basis, allocated in individual pens. The diet consisted of 840 g/kg concentrate and 160 g/kg corn silage for 76 d, with the first 12 d as an adaptation period and the remaining 64 d on the finishing diet. The SM20 diet increased blood urea concentration (P = 0.03) while reduced glucose concentration (P = 0.04). Lambs fed SM showed higher subcutaneous fat deposition (P = 0.04) and higher subcutaneous adipocyte diameter (P < 0.01), in addition to reduced meat lipid oxidation (P < 0.01). SM reduced the quantity of branched-chain fatty acids in longissimus thoracis (P = 0.05) and increased the quantity of saturated fatty acids (P = 0.01). In the transcriptomic analysis, 294 genes were identified as differentially expressed, which belong to pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, citric acid cycle, and monosaccharide metabolic process. In conclusion, diet with SM increased carcass fat deposition, reduced lipid oxidation, and changed the energy metabolism, supporting its use in ruminant nutrition. Lay Summary This study investigated the effects of incorporating soybean molasses (SM) into the diet of castrated lambs on various aspects of their performance and meat quality. Twenty lambs were divided into two groups: one was fed a control diet without SM whereas the other was fed a similar diet but containing 20% of SM. The feeding trial lasted for 76 d. Results showed that the SM inclusion in the diet led to increased blood urea levels and decreased glucose concentrations. SM inclusion also resulted in lambs with higher levels of subcutaneous fat and larger adipocytes, while reducing meat lipid oxidation. Moreover, SM altered fatty acid composition in the meat, decreasing branched-chain fatty acids and increasing saturated fatty acids. In agreement with these findings, transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant change in the expression of genes related to energy metabolism in the muscle of lambs fed SM. In conclusion, incorporating SM in lamb's diet increased fat deposition, improved meat quality, and induced a transcriptomic change in the muscle energy metabolism, supporting its potential use in ruminant nutrition.

TI Efficient anodic chemical conversion to boost hydrogen evolution with
   low energy consumption over cobalt-doped nickel sulfide electrocatalyst
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Electrocatalytic oxidation of small molecules to replace sluggish water oxidation presents a promising strategy for clean hydrogen production with low energy consumption. Herein, we reported a reliable and universal method to fabricate the leaf-like Co-doped Ni3S2 architecture anchored on Ni mesh. The optimized Co-doped Ni3S2 electrocatalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and chemical oxidation as well as excellent durability. Specifically, a significantly reduced cell voltage of 0.80 V is attained at 50 mA cm-2 in sulfion-containing electrolytes, which is about 0.94 and 1.20 V lower than that of urea electrolysis and water splitting, respectively. In situ Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical characterization results imply that the desired oxidation state of the NiIII formed on the surface with shortened oxidation pathway accounts for the increased urea oxidation, whereas a direct electron transfer to surface active sites is responsible for superior sulfion oxidation. In situ spectroscopic evidences further unravel that the sulfion (S2-) were stepwisely oxidized to short-chain polysulfides including S(2)(2-)and S(4)(2-)and then to elemental sulfur (S-8). This work highlights that the integrated overall reaction holds the great promise for saving energy H-2 generation and environmentally friendly recovery of sulfur with enhanced electron utilization efficiency.

TI Fabrication of durable flame retardant PAN fibers through bio-based
   ammonium phytate surface modification and highly efficient thermal
   oxidation
SO EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL
AB To address the flammable shortcoming of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers, an ammonium phytate (AP) flame retardant was fabricated by using biomass phytic acid (PA) and urea as raw materials. PAN fibers were firstly treated with AP aqueous solution, which were then thermally oxidized to gain durable flame retardant PAN fibers (O-AP-PAN). The structure of fibers was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results indicated that AP promoted the formation of a thermally stable cyclic conjugated structure, and the P element was incorporated into the PAN fibers through covalent bond. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of O-AP-PAN fibers improved from 17.0% of PAN fibers to 36.6%. Even after 50 laundering cycles, the LOI value of O-AP-PAN maintained as high as 30.5%, indicating exceptional washing durability. Additionally, the total heat release and heat release capacity of O-AP-PAN were reduced by 46.8% and 52.7%, respectively. Besides, the mechanical strength of O-AP-PAN was well maintained without affecting practical use. In this work, a simple and feasible durable flame retardant strategy for PAN fibers was established, which was convenient for large-scale preparation of flame retardant PAN fibers.

TI Malfunction in Mitochondrial β-Oxidation Contributes to Lipid
   Accumulation in Hepatocyte-Like Cells Derived from Citrin
   Deficiency-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
SO STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Citrin deficiency (CD) is a recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the citrin gene SLC25A13. CD causes various symptoms related to nutrient metabolism such as urea cycle failure, abnormal amino acid levels, and fatty liver. To understand the pathophysiology of CD, the molecular phenotypes were investigated using induced pluripotent stem cells derived from fibroblasts of CD patient (CD-iPSCs). In this study, we demonstrate that aberrant mitochondrial beta-oxidation may lead to fatty liver in CD patients. CD-iPSCs normally differentiated into hepatocytes, similar to wild-type iPSCs (WT-iPSCs). However, hepatocytes derived from CD-iPSCs (CD-HLCs) did not exhibit ureogenesis. Cellular triglyceride and lipid granule levels were significantly increased in CD-HLCs compared with WT-HLCs. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) and its target genes which are involved in mitochondrial beta-oxidation were downregulated in CD-HLCs, and treatment with a PPAR-alpha agonist partially reduced the lipid accumulation in CD-HLCs. In addition, the mitochondria in CD-HLCs exhibited abnormal morphologies. Based on these observations, we conclude that the lipid accumulation in CD-HLCs results from dysfunctional mitochondrial beta-oxidation and abnormal mitochondrial structure.

TI Effect of Fe oxidation state (+2 versus+3) in precursor on the structure
   of Fe oxides/carbonates-based composites examined by XPS, FTIR and EXAFS
SO SOLID STATE SCIENCES
AB Here we investigate the influence of Fe oxidation state (either Fe(II) or Fe(III) sulfates) in precursor of the same chemical composition on the atomic scale structure, surface speciation and adsorptive anion removal of the purely inorganic composites produced under the urea supported hydrothermal synthesis. In case of utilization of Fe3+ precursor, the materials chemistry was solely dominated by the formation of highly crystalline Fe(III) oxides, however the particle surfaces were covered with small quantities of FeCO3 (not detectable by EXAFS/XANES/FTIR) precipitated after the autoclave was turned off. Within the reactive medium with Fe 2+ precursor, due to high pressure in autoclave which facilitated reducing conditions and sedimentation of Fe2+ divalent, two main processes took place one of which was the formation of Fe hydrous oxides; the second reaction resulted in generation of FeCO3, which become a predominant phase in volume averaged composition. Notably, despite the prevalence of Fe(II) carbonates in bulk structure, the narrow upper layers (XPS detectable) was enriched with Fe (III) oxides. At the chosen autoclave temperature of 150 degrees C, both samples had low hydration of physisorbed water, which confirmed our recent hypothesis about correlation between Fe (or another metal formed oxides) local structure in outer shells fitted with several (many) oxygen atoms and the material hydration with physisorbed water. None of the two composites demonstrated strong adsorptive removal of seven anions (F-, Br-, BrO3-, HAsO42-, H3AsO3, HPO42-, SeO42-), which verified another idea about the interdependence of distinguished (EXAFS simulated) outer shells of metals (here, Fe) fitted with two paths simultaneously ({Fe-Fe}(+) (Fe-O}) one peak and the anion exchange potential. Overall, the Fe(III)-precursor product was more crystalline, less heterogeneous (fewer phases), showed worse anion uptake than the other sample. The material prepared from Fe(II) precursor is considered to be a promising precursor for further phase transformations via thermal or hydrothermal treatments (due to generous presence of FeCO3).

TI Structural and optical properties of nitrogen-iron co-doped titanium
   dioxide films prepared via sol-gel dip-coating: Effect of urea and iron
   nitrate concentration in the sol
SO MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK
AB In this study, nitrogen-iron co-doped titanium dioxide films were prepared via sol-gel dip-coating method using urea and iron nitrate as nitrogen and iron source, respectively. Nonmetal doping of TiO2 have some disadvantages such as massive charge carrier recombination and losing the photo-catalytic capability. Three different nitrogen-iron co-doped titanium dioxide sols with different urea and iron nitrate concentration were prepared. The resulting sols were homogeneous and transparent, and no precipitation was observed in any of them. It was observed that the film prepared with middle urea-iron nitrate concentration sol got opaque in a short time after the dip-coating process. All prepared films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. It was found that the concentration of the urea and iron nitrate in the sol had an effect on the crystal structure, microstructure, surface morphology and optical properties of the resulting films. Samples with middle concentrations had amorphous structure and bigger particle size. It was seen that sample with higher iron amount has lower band-gap. It is concluded that we can prepare transparent anatase, transparent amorphous and opaque amorphous titanium dioxide films by changing the urea and iron nitrate concentration in the sol.

   of
   CeO2-ZrO2-La2O3-Nd2</su
   b>O3 by a urea-assisted low-temperature (90 A°C) hydrothermal
   procedure
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Conventional co-precipitation combined with a urea-assisted low-temperature (90 A degrees C) hydrothermal procedure (CZU) and the same method without urea (CZ) were used to prepare material CeO2-ZrO2-La2O3-Nd2O3. X-ray diffraction, Raman, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscope, hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to study the structural, textural, reduction behavior and surface elemental composition of the materials. The results reveal that, compared to CZ, CZU exhibits more outstanding structural property, higher thermal stability and higher low-temperature reducibility. The results also show that the stability of the reduction behavior is closely related to its surface chemical properties, especially the variation of the surface atomic ratio of Ce/Zr and the surface oxygen species. The possible mechanism of urea was also discussed in this study. In addition, with regard to corresponding Pd-only three-way catalysts, remarkably boosted catalytic performance of Pd/CZU is also obtained than that of Pd/CZ, and which suggests that CZU holds better prospective applications.

TI The Role of Calcination Temperature in the Self-cleaning Functionality
   of Urea-Doped TiO2 Prepared through In Situ Heat-Assisted
   Sol-Gel Synthesis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
AB In this study, urea-doped titanium dioxide (urea-TiO2) nanoparticles were synthesized through an in situ heat-assisted sol-gel technique using titanium (IV) isopropoxide as the precursor for titanium dioxide and urea as a nitrogen source. The nanoparticles were calcined at 300, 500, and 700 degrees C to study the effect of the calcination temperature on their function as self-cleaning material. The nanoparticles were characterized using a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron microscope for morphology, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy for structure, UV-Vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy for optical analysis. The self-cleaning study was carried out by letting samples degrade methylene blue and Rhodamine-B under UV irradiation. The morphological analysis reveals particle size distribution with more disparity at higher calcination temperatures. At lower calcination temperatures, the dopant caused high clustering of particles, keeping them linked together in muddy form and layers. Structural analysis showed that the particles were nanostructured with average crystallite sizes ranging from 2.35 to 16.13 nm and phase transformation from anatase to rutile after calcining at 700 degrees C. The nitrogen presence created a lattice disorder in the TiO2 structure, and the impact of higher calcination temperature on the nanoparticles further shifted the band toward a higher wavenumber under FTIR analysis. The optical bandgap reduced from 3.29 eV at 300 degrees C to 3.09 eV at 700 degrees C. The determined values of the rate constant from the photodegradation test showed that the highest rate was obtained at 700 degrees C, indicating enhanced self-cleaning functionality with an increase in calcination temperature of urea-TiO2.

TI Effect of graphite exfoliation degree on the corrosion protection for
   epoxy composite coating
SO COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS
AB Four kinds of graphite derivatives in different exfoliation degrees were synthesized via modified Hummers' method by controlling the mass ration of graphite and KMnO4. The modified graphite derivatives (GUF) were synthesized through chemical modification with the prepolymer of urea-formaldehyde. Results of Raman spectroscopy (Raman) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the layer exfoliation was affected by oxidation degree during the preparation of graphene oxide (GO). The highly exfoliated GO was fully modified by UF resin and presented excellent compatibility with epoxy resin. The data of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) verified the optimal corrosion resistance of GUF/EP composite coating with the highly exfoliated GO sheets. The data of localized electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (LEIS) demonstrated that the highly exfoliated modified GO exhibited slight galvanic corrosion in the defective coatings.

TI Degradation of 75 organic micropollutants in fresh human urine and water
   by UV advanced oxidation process
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB In household wastewater, a large proportion of organic micropollutants (OMPs) load is attributed to human urine. OMPs could pose a risk to human and environmental health when urine collected in source-separating sanitation systems is recycled as crop fertiliser. This study evaluated degradation of 75 OMPs in human urine treated by a UV-based advanced oxidation process. Fresh urine and water samples were spiked with a broad range of OMPs and fed into a photoreactor equipped with a UV lamp (185 and 254 nm) that generated free radicals in situ. Degradation rate constant and the energy required to degrade 90% of all the OMPs in both matrices were determined. At a UV dose of 2060 J m-2, average & sigma;OMP degradation of 99% (& PLUSMN;4%) in water and 55% (& PLUSMN;36%) in fresh urine was achieved. The energy demand for removal of OMPs in water was <1500 J m-2, but for removal of OMPs in urine at least 10-fold more energy was needed. A combination of photolysis and photo-oxidation can explain the degradation of OMPs during UV treatment. Organic substances (e.g. urea, creatinine) likely inhibited degradation of OMPs in urine by competitively absorbing UV-light and scavenging free radicals. There was no reduction in the nitrogen content of urine during treatment. In summary, UV treatment can reduce the load of OMPs to urine recycling sanitation systems.

AB Bimetallic Au-Ni supported on TiO2 were prepared using co-deposition-precipitation with urea and tested on the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. The catalyst containing the lower amount of Ni (atomic Au:Ni 1:0.08) showed a satisfying compromise between activity provided by Ni and selectivity to butenes provided by Au for this selective hydrogenation reaction. Even though Au and Ni exhibit limited miscibility in the bulk, characterizations by TPR and UV-vis spectroscopy showed evidence of interaction between Au and Ni in nanoparticles. STEM-XEDS study confirmed the formation of bimetallic nanoparticles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Isolation and characterization of thermo-tolerant polyphenol oxidases in

SO FOOD CONTROL
AB Polyphenols are important active components of tea. Tea polyphenol oxidase (PPO) catalyzes polyphenols oxidation, hence it is vitally important to the quality and function of black tea. The enzyme was believed to be mostly deactivated during the thermal processing. Here we report the macromolecular fraction of a Chinese black tea (Camellia. sinensis var. Lapsang souchong) infusion oxidized pyrocatechol even at the enzyme's deactivation temperature. Utilizing urea-assisted extraction and ion-exchange chromatography, the PPOs and/or co-enzymes were isolated from the tea infusion and the cold water extracts of fresh tea leaves. The isolates were found to exhibit PPO activities after removing urea by dialysis. A 66.0 kDa PPO with specific activity of 1200 U/mg (Km = 6.973 mM and Vmax = 15.79 U/min) was purified and characterized to be a glycoprotein with isoelectric point of 4.82. The efficiency of four inhibitors against this PPO are cysteine > EDTA > sodium sulfite > ascorbic acid. The PPOs isolated from black tea infusion reserved 40-80% of activities of their aliquots from fresh tea leaves. It reveals the PPOs can survive the thermal processing of the black tea, possibly in form of PPO-polyphenol complex. Exploring the biochemistry and oxidation mechanism of tea infusion, this study may empower the future development of tea and plant-based beverages.

TI Effect of Carnosine on Renal Function, Oxidation and Glycation Products
   in the Kidneys of High-Fat Diet/Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & DIABETES
AB Background High fat diet (HFD) and low dose of streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats provide an animal model for type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Oxidative stress plays a role in the development of diabetic complications. Carnosine (CAR) has antioxidant and antiglycating properties. We investigated effects of CAR on renal function, oxidation and glycation products in HFD + STZ-rats.
   Materials and Methods Rats were fed with HFD (60 % of total calories from fat) for 4 weeks and then a single dose STZ (40 mg/kg; i. p.) was applied. Rats with blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dL were fed with HFD until the end of the 12th week. CAR (250 mg/kg body weight; i. p.; 5 times a week) was administered to rats for the last 4 weeks. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose, lipids, and andrenal function tests in serum as well as reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, advanced oxidation protein products, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), antioxidant power, and antioxidant enzyme activities and their mRNA expressions in kidneys were determined.
   Results CAR treatment did not alter glucose and HbA1c, but it decreased serum lipids, creatinine, and urea levels in HFD + STZ rats. Oxidation products of lipids and proteins and AGEs levels decreased, but antioxidant enzyme activities and their mRNA expressions remained unchanged due to CAR treatment.
   Conclusion Our results indicate that CAR treatment alleviated renal function and decreased accumulation of oxidation and glycation products in kidneys in HFD + STZ-rats.

The complex was isolated as an air-stable crystalline solid and characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, solution electrical conductivity, and by single-crystal X-ray structure analysis. The structure, electronic properties, and vibrational normal modes of the complex were investigated by DFT. The use of this complex as a catalyst for the oxidation of sulfides to their corresponding sulfoxides using urea hydrogen peroxide as the primary oxidant was investigated. The catalyst shows very efficient reactivity, giving high yields and selectivities at room temperature under air.

TI Supportive activity of Pt nanoparticles on the nitrogen-doped graphene
   nanosheet with vacancy defects for catalyzing neutral glucose oxidation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Catalyst support alters the electronic structure of metal catalysts, resulting in an enhanced activity. In this study, nitrogen-doped defective graphene nanosheet-supported Pt nanoparticles (2.8 nm) (Pt/N-dGN) were prepared and successfully used as electrocatalysts in the sequential and transient catalysis of the neutral d-glucose oxidation reaction (GOR). The Pt nanoparticles were determined to be single crystals enclosed with the (110) plane. The spherical-aberration-corrected field transmission electron microscopy image revealed a Pt/N-dGN bearing with point vacancies, 5-8-5, 5-9, and 5-7-7-5 defects. N-dGN was prepared by fast exfoliation and sequential nitrogen doping with urea using a sonoelectrochemical and hydrothermal method. The Pt/N-dGN with a Pt binding energy of 71.4 eV showed significant mass activity (7.83 x 10(19) molecules g(Pt)(-1)) toward the sequential catalysis of neutral GOR. The electron transfer number was 2.71 and approximately two-electron transfer mechanisms occurred. The repeated currents of GORs were observed in the catalysis from the 2nd cycle to the 25th cycle.

TI Simultaneous Removal of SO2 and NO Using
   H2O2/Urea Activated by Vacuum Ultraviolet Light in
   a Pilot-Scale Spraying Tower
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB A study on simultaneous removal of SO2 and NO from flue gas using H2O2/urea activated by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light was carried out in a pilot-scale photochemical spraying tower. The effects of different operational variables on simultaneous removal efficiencies of SO2 and NO were investigated. The gaseous and liquid removal products were detected by the flue gas analyzer and ion chromatography (IC), respectively. The removal pathways of SO2 and NO were analyzed. The application prospect of this new method was also preliminarily discussed. Results show that under most of the process conditions tested, SO2 can attain complete removal. Removal efficiency of NO is enhanced under increasing the VUV irradiation intensity and H2O2 concentration, but it is inhibited by an increase of the flue gas flow and NO concentration. The urea concentration and liquid-gas ratio have a dual influence on NO removal, and its removal efficiency increases first and then decreases. SO2 concentration has little impact on NO removal. IC results show that SO42- and NO3- are the main removal products in solution. (OH)-O-center dot derived from VUV activation of H2O2 plays the crucial role in NO removal.

TI One-step pyrolysis conversion of glucose and urea into melanoidin for
   highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Photocatalytic generation of hydrogen peroxide from water and dioxygen without organic electron donor becomes an emerging strategy and research focus to convert solar energy into green chemicals. However, previously reported photocatalysts have suffered from low efficiency, high cost, and complex synthesis procedure. In this study, we report a melanoidin (ME) composed of furan-pyrrole units by one-step pyrolysis of glucose with urea. The pi-conjugated donor (furan)-acceptor (pyrrole) structure enhances the separation of photocarriers and broadens the photo-absorption range. The prepared ME catalyst demonstrates outstanding H2O2 production performance with high efficiency (330 mu M g(-1)h(-1)) without any sacrificial agent or O-2 aeration under visible light. Moreover, melanoidins synthesized using different precursors demonstrate high H2O2 production efficiency as well, indicating the universality of the catalyst synthesis strategy. This is the first report of melanoidin catalysts in photocatalytic H2O2 generation, which presents new insights in metal-free catalyst in highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production.

TI Metabolic Heat Stress Adaption in Transition Cows: Differences in
   Macronutrient Oxidation between Late-Gestating and Early-Lactating
   German Holstein Dairy Cows
SO PLOS ONE
AB High ambient temperatures have severe adverse effects on biological functions of high-yielding dairy cows. The metabolic adaption to heat stress was examined in 14 German Holsteins transition cows assigned to two groups, one heat-stressed (HS) and one pair-fed (PF) at the level of HS. After 6 days of thermoneutrality and ad libitum feeding (P1), cows were challenged for 6 days (P2) by heat stress (temperature humidity index (THI) = 76) or thermoneutral pair-feeding in climatic chambers 3 weeks ante partum and again 3 weeks post-partum. On the sixth day of each period P1 or P2, oxidative metabolism was analyzed for 24 hours in open circuit respiration chambers. Water and feed intake, vital parameters and milk yield were recorded. Daily blood samples were analyzed for glucose, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, non-esterified fatty acids, urea, creatinine, methyl histidine, adrenaline and noradrenaline. In general, heat stress caused marked effects on water homeorhesis with impairments of renal function and a strong adrenergic response accompanied with a prevalence of carbohydrate oxidation over fat catabolism. Heat-stressed cows extensively degraded tissue protein as reflected by the increase of plasma urea, creatinine and methyl histidine concentrations. However, the acute metabolic heat stress response in dry cows differed from early-lactating cows as the prepartal adipose tissue was not refractory to lipolytic, adrenergic stimuli, and the rate of amino acid oxidation was lower than in the postpartal stage. Together with the lower endogenous metabolic heat load, metabolic adaption in dry cows is indicative for a higher heat tolerance and the prioritization of the nutritional requirements of the fast-growing near-term fetus. These findings indicate that the development of future nutritional strategies for attenuating impairments of health and performance due to ambient heat requires the consideration of the physiological stage of dairy cows.

TI Facile homogeneous precipitation method to prepare MnO2 with
   high performance in catalytic oxidation of ethyl acetate
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A facile homogeneous precipitation method driven by synchronous reactions of urea hydrolysis and potassium permanganate reduction is proposed for preparation of MnO2 catalysts. Pure alpha-MnO2 nanostructures with different morphologies, including nanowires, nanorods and nanoparticles, were obtained by simply tuning the precipitation conditions. The evolution of materials derived from different preparation conditions was investigated via X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, chemisorption and DFT calculations. The precipitation temperature and time significantly influenced the physiochemical properties of as-prepared catalysts. With increasing precipitation temperature and time, the degree of crystallinity, BET surface area and amount of surface-adsorbed oxygen of alpha-MnO2 exhibited a substantial increase. The main exposed surface facets varied from (2 0 0), (3 1 0) to (2 1 1) as temperature and time increased. The best precipitation temperature and time were 90 degrees C and 24 h respectively. The optimal alpha-MnO2 catalyst demonstrated 100% conversion of 1000 ppm ethyl acetate under the high space velocity of 78,000 h(-1) during a 113-h test at 190 degrees C, outperforming other manganese oxide catalysts and many typical noble metal catalysts in terms of activity and stability. Experimental results and DFT calculations were consistent and indicated that surface oxygen species originating from the (2 1 1) surface of alpha-MnO2 were most active. This study provides important insights for manipulating the morphology of MnO2 by a facile method and remarkably promoting the performance for ethyl acetate VOC elimination.

TI Recent Advances in Electrochemical Hydrogen Production from Water
   Assisted by Alternative Oxidation Reactions
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Water electrolysis has been considered a promising avenue for ultrapure hydrogen production. However, the energy efficiency of conventional water electrolysis technologies is severely hampered by the kinetic limitations of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Over the past decade, an innovative hybrid water electrolysis strategy of replacing the OER with more facile oxidation reactions and coupling with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been developed and demonstrated its utility of addressing the critical challenges in conventional water electrolysis. In this Review, we summarize the recent progress concerning electrochemical hydrogen production from water through hybrid water electrolysis technology, with special emphasis on the selection of electrocatalysts and alternative anodic oxidation reactions as well as the related mechanisms involving in electrochemical reactions. Finally, the current challenges and some perspectives are also discussed for the future development of hybrid water electrolysis technology.

TI Catalytic activity of ethylbenzene with product selectivity by gold
   nanoparticles supported on zinc oxide
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The oxidation of ethylbenzene (EB) using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as the oxidizing agent was carried out in presence of gold nanoparticles (3 nm) supported on zinc oxide in acetonitrile solution. A higher selectivity towards acetophenone (ACP) as the major product, and a moderate selectivity towards other products such as 1-phenylethanol (PE), benzaldehyde (BZL), and benzoic acid (BzA) were observed using the prepared Au/ZnO nanocatalysts at 100 ??C for 24 h. It is suggested the reaction produces an intermediate product, which is dimethylethyl???1-phenylethyl peroxide through a radical mechanism. A small amount of benzaldehyde was observed because benzaldehyde went autoxidation to form benzoic acid with the presence of oxidation agent of TBHP during reaction. The factors affecting the catalytic activity such as gold loading, calcination treatment at 300??C, type of solvent, reaction time, reaction temperature, oxidant to substrate molar ratio, catalyst weight, and solvent volume were studied. The gold nanoparticle catalyst synthesized by deposition precipitation method using urea was characterized by XRD, HRTEM, ATR-IR, XRF, and BET and offers a very selective reaction pathway for the oxidation of ethylbenzene.

TI Nicotinamide riboside rescues dysregulated glycolysis and fatty acid
   β-oxidation in a human hepatic cell model of citrin deficiency
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
AB Citrin deficiency (CD) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by loss-of-function of the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate transporter, CITRIN, which is involved in both the urea cycle and malate-aspartate shuttle. Patients with CD develop hepatosteatosis and hyperammonemia but there is no effective therapy for CD. Currently, there are no animal models that faithfully recapitulate the human CD phenotype. Accordingly, we generated a CITRIN knockout HepG2 cell line using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas 9 genome editing technology to study metabolic and cell signaling defects in CD. CITRIN KO cells showed increased ammonia accumulation, higher cytosolic ratio of reduced versus oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and reduced glycolysis. Surprisingly, these cells showed impaired fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial activity. CITRIN KO cells also displayed increased cholesterol and bile acid metabolism resembling those observed in CD patients. Remarkably, normalizing cytosolic NADH:NAD(+) ratio by nicotinamide riboside increased glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation but had no effect on the hyperammonemia suggesting the urea cycle defect was independent of the aspartate/malate shuttle defect of CD. The correction of glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism defects in CITRIN KO cells by reducing cytoplasmic NADH:NAD(+) levels suggests this may be a novel strategy to treat some of the metabolic defects of CD and other mitochondrial diseases.

TI Highly efficient p-p heterojunction Co3S4/NiS2 electrocatalyst for water
   splitting and electrochemical oxidation of organic molecules
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Organic small molecular-assisted water splitting technology is an efficient and promising technology for hydrogen production, which can meet the needs of obtaining hydrogen energy and protecting the environment. Constructing heterojunctions to enhance the interfacial electron transfer and achieve bifunctionality represents a viable strategy for enhancing the performance of electrocatalysts. In this work, the hollow structure Co3S4/NiS2 p-p heterojunction catalyst has been successfully synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. Only -0.184, 1.64, 1.44 and 1.56 V vs. RHE are required to drive 50 mA cm- 2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), oxygen evolution reaction in lactic acid solution (OERLA), respectively. For two-electrode electrolytic process, the cell voltages only need 1.72 V, 1.51 V and 1.61 V to drive 50 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH, 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea and 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M lactic acid electrolytes, and it operates continuously at 50 mA cm- 2 for 200 h test without significant decay of activity in 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M lactic acid, showing excellent durability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the p-p heterojunction between Co3S4 and NiS2 facilitates the electron redistribution at interfaces, thereby promoting the electron migration. This work presents a strategic approach for fabricating advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts by employing metal sulfides to form heterojunction, thereby achieving enhanced electrocatalytic activities in both hydrogen production and organic molecule decontamination.

TI The effect of salinity and calcium on diffusive water flux, oxygen
   consumption, and nitrogenous waste excretion rates in Pacific sanddab
   (Citharichthys sordidus) and Rock sole (Lepidopsetta
   bilineata)
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
AB Marine flatfishes have a low metabolic rate and routinely encounter large fluctuations in salinity, and are therefore of interest in the study of diffusive water flux (a proxy for transcellular water permeability), oxygen consumption (M?O-2), ammonia excretion and urea-N excretion as a function of salinity and seawater [Ca2+]. These parameters were measured in two coastal marine flatfishes, Pacific sanddab and Rock sole acclimated to 31 ppt and exposed acutely (for up to 3 h), to environmentally relevant salinities of 45, 15.5, or 7.5 ppt. In both species, diffusive water flux and ammonia excretion rates increased as salinity decreased. M?O-2 and urea-N excretion rates remained relatively unchanged. Nitrogen quotient analysis indicated increased oxidation of protein at lower salinity. A second experimental series was performed on Rock sole to separate the effects of salinity from those of ambient [Ca2+]. In direct contrast to the significant increase seen at 7.5 ppt, reducing salinity from 31 ppt to 7.5 ppt while maintaining [Ca2+] at 10 mM or increasing it to 20 mM resulted in no change in diffusive water flux rate, demonstrating that reduced [Ca2+], rather than reduced salinity itself, is the primary cause for the increases in diffusive water flux. However, ammonia excretion rate increased when salinity was decreased and [Ca2+] was increased compared to 31 ppt with added [Ca2+]. Our results demonstrate that both diffusive water flux and ammonia excretion rates are a function of salinity, that neither are coupled to M?O-2, and that ambient [Ca2+] also plays a role in these rates.

TI Bi-functional Ni3S2@MoS2 heterostructure with strong built-in field as
   highly-efficient electrolytic catalyst
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Constructing heterojunction is an efficient way to enhance the catalytic activity for urea electrolytic catalysts, especially the heterostructure with a positive built-in field. Here, we prepare a core-shell catalyst of Ni3S2@MoS2 with Schottky junctions. The built-in field at the core/shell interface modifies the electron distribution and the Fermi level of MoS2 surface, which greatly enhances the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Further, with change of the shell thickness, we establish the correlation between the built-in field and catalytic properties. Ni3S2@MoS2 core-shell catalyst with shell thickness of about 10 nm delivers unprecedented UOR and HER performances of 1.336 V at 10 mA cm-2 and -0.098 V at -10 mA cm-2, respectively. This work develops an efficient route to synthesizing heterostructure catalysts with precise structure control and provides novel materials to optimize the microstructure of a heterogeneous catalyst system with pre-designable built-in field effects.

TI Ultrathin Two-Dimensional Bimetal-Organic FrameworkNanosheets as

SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Ultrathin two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (2DMOFs) have the potential to improve the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA)with a large surface area and open catalytic active sites. To achieve high-efficiency electrocatalysts for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, a moderatesolvothermal method was evolved to synthesize a series of 2D MOFs on nickelfoam (Ni-MOF/NF, NiCo-61-MOF/NF, NiCo-21-MOF/NF). As theelectrocatalyst used for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, NiCo-61-MOF/NFpresented a lower overpotential and superior chemical durability than otherelectrocatalysts; it only required a potential of similar to 1.52 V (vs RHE) to reach338.16 mA cm-2, with an oxidation efficiency of more than 86%. Besides, aftercontinuous electrocatalysis for 20 000 s at 1.42 V (vs RHE), the currentdensity of NiCo-61-MOF/NF nanosheets was still 38.67 mA cm-2with77.34% retention. This demonstrated that NiCo-61-MOF/NF nanosheetelectrocatalysts had great potential for benzyl alcohol oxidation. From both the experimental and theoretical studies, it wasdiscovered that NiCo-61-MOF/NF nanosheets have the highest electrocatalytic activity due to their distinctive ultrathin 2Dstructure, optimized electron structure, and more accessible active sites. Thisfinding would pave a brand-new thought for the designof electrocatalysts with electrocatalytic activity for benzyl alcohol oxidation (EBO)

TI Modification of the electronic structure of g-C3N4
   using urea to enhance the visible light-assisted degradation of organic
   pollutants
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Graphitic carbon nitride has been proven to be a good candidate for using solar energy for photo-induced pollutant degradation. However, the high photo-induced holes-electron recombination rate, unfavorable morphology, and textural properties limited their application. In this study, we present a novel g-C3N4 with a novel electronic structure and physiochemical properties by introducing a single nitrogen in the graphitic network of the g-C3N4 through a novel method involving step-by-step co-polycondensation of melamine and urea. Through extensive characterization using techniques such as XPS, UPS-XPS, Raman, XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, and N-2 adsorption-desorption, we analyze the electronic and crystallographic properties, as well as the morphology and textural features of the newly prepared g-C3N4 (N-g-C3N4). This material exhibits a lower C/N ratio of 0.62 compared to conventional g-C3N4 and a reduced band gap of 2.63 eV. The newly prepared g-C3N4 demonstrates a distinct valance band maxima that enhances its photo-induced oxidation potential, improving photocatalytic activity in degrading various organic pollutants. We thoroughly investigate the photocatalytic degradation performance of N-g-C3N4 for Congo red (CR) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and removal of up to 90 and 86% was attained after 2 h at solution pH of 5.5 for CR and SMX. The influence of different parameters was examined to understand the degradation mechanism and the influence of reactive oxygenated species. The catalytic performance is also evaluated in the degradation of various organic pollutants, and it showed a good performance.

TI Long-term application of controlled-release urea reduced ammonia
   volatilization, raising the risk of N2O emissions and improved summer
   maize yield
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Context: With the extensive promotion of controlled-release urea (CRU), its N-release pattern has been shown to match the crop's N-demand period and improve crop yield by reducing N losses. Nevertheless, the impacts of CRU on summer maize yield, especially on greenhouse gas emissions, have rarely been reported during its longterm use. Objective: It is necessary through long-term positioning field experiment with CRU application to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of maize yield formation, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), ammonia volatilization and greenhouse gas emissions. Methods: The long-term fertilizer positioning experiment for ten years, four treatments were performed: polymeric-coated controlled-release urea (CRF, 42% N, 3-months controlled-release period), sulfur-coated controlled-release urea (SCF, 35% N, 3-months controlled-release period), common urea (CCF, 46% N) and no nitrogen fertilizer (CK). Results: Results showed that the two coated controlled-release fertilizers significantly increased NUE and dry matter accumulation in summer maize, and ultimately improved grain yield. Compared to CCF, CRF and SCF treatments increased post-silking dry matter accumulation by 16.3% and 13.3%; NUE by 42.3% and 28.9%. The 2-year mean grain yield of CRF and SCF treatment increased 9.0% and 12.4% compared to CCF treatment. CRF treatment significantly increased the NO3- -N content in 0-60 cm soil layer; while CRF and SCF treatments showed a significantly higher NH4+-N concentration in the 0-20 cm soil layer than CCF treatment. Compared to CCF treatment, the CRF and SCF treatments significantly reduced peak ammonia volatilization, and the average cumulative emissions of ammonia volatilization of two years were reduced by 80.8% and 53.2%, respectively. CRF treatment had lower peak of N2O emissions but longer N2O emission duration than other N application treatments. The two-year average cumulative N2O emissions from CRF treatment increased by 49.6%, and SCF treatment increased by 61.1% compared to CCF treatment. Compared to CK treatment, total cumulative CH4 uptake was 36.1% lower in CRF treatment, 60.9% in SCF and 78.9% in CCF treatment. The higher cumulative N2O emissions from CRF and SCF treatment resulted in a significantly higher global warming potential (GWP) than CCF treatment. The two-year mean increase in greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) was 36.2% for CRF treatment and 44.7% for SCF treatment compared to CCF treatment. Conclusions: Long-term application of coated controlled-release fertilizers could achieve high yields and nitrogen use efficiency. However, there is a risk of increased N2O emissions, causing elevated GHGI. Significance: In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the research on the comprehensive effects of long-term reduced application of CRU on crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions, in order to promote the wide application of environmentally friendly CRU in the field.

TI The impact of eco-friendly chemical incorporation on the thermal
   oxidation process of flax fiber prior to carbonization and activation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The oxidative thermal stability of plant-based microcrystalline flax fiber was developed by incorporating diammonium phosphate (DAP), boric acid, and urea (in brief DAP-BAU) followed by a multistep thermal oxidation process. By utilizing a set of measurements, including X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy analysis, the impact of DAP-BAU inclusion on the thermal stability of flax fibers was studied. The findings of IR spectra and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the dehydrogenation and dehydration processes cause a progressive and steady loss of inter- and intramolecular H-bondings. Infrared spectra also showed the development of C = C double bonds associated with the crosslinked ladder structure formation. DSC and TGA findings revealed that DAP-BAU incorporation boosted thermal stability by generating ladder-like structure formation and restricted the development of volatile by-products by inhibiting the fundamental hydroxyl groups with increasing oxidation time. The overall findings of this study confirm that DAP-BAU incorporated and 125 min stabilized (at 245 degrees C) flax fibers attain complete thermal stability and are ready for utilizing in the subsequent carbonization and activation stages in activated carbon fiber manufacturing.

TI Catalytic methane reforming into synthesis gas over developed composite
   materials prepared by combustion synthesis
SO REACTION KINETICS MECHANISMS AND CATALYSIS
AB In this work, the results of carbon dioxide reforming and partial oxidation of CH4 on the catalysts prepared by solution combustion synthesis (SCS) and impregnation of moisture capacity methods are presented. Investigation of the activity of catalysts produced from initial mixture of Co(NO3)(2)-Mg(NO3)(2)-H3BO3 and glycine/urea of different composition was carried out for the production of synthesis gas and comparison of carbon dioxide reforming and partial oxidation of methane. Co((3))(2)+Mg(NO3)(2)+H3BO3 catalyst containing glycine has a higher activity than the catalyst containing urea. The CH4 conversion reaches 54.6%, and the conversion of CO2 increases to 51.7%, while the yield of H-2 and CO is 54.1% and 51.3%, respectively, at 900 degrees C. It was found that CoMg3O4 spinel formation is due to magnesium cations substitution of cobalt cations. Mg2+ ions are replaced by ions of Co2+, as a consequence CoMg3O4 lattice parameters increase, since the ionic radius of Mg2+ (0.66 angstrom) less than C2+ (0.72 angstrom). Some advantage of SCS catalysts in comparison with catalysts prepared by the traditional impregnation method in the processes of dry reforming and partial oxidation of methane was shown.

TI What are the clues for an inherited metabolic disorder in Reye syndrome?
   A single Centre study of 58 children
SO MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM
AB Objectives: Reye Syndrome is an acute encephalopathy with increased liver enzymes and blood ammonia, without jaundice. The prevalence of an underlying inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) is unclear, nor the clinical or biological factors directing toward this diagnosis. Our aims were to define these clues in a large series of patients.
   Patients and methods: We retrospectively studied all patients with Reye admitted in our institution from 1995. We defined 3 groups: Group 1 with a confirmed IMD, Group 2 considered as free of IMD, Group 3 unclassified. Statistical analysis compared patients in Groups 1 and 2, to find criteria for a diagnosis of IMD.
   Results: Fifty-eight children were included; 41 (71%) had a confirmed IMD, 12 (20%) were free of IMD, and 5 remained unclassified. IMDs included Urea Cycle Disorders (51%), Fatty-Acid Oxidation Disorders (24%), ketogenesis defects (5%), other mitochondrial energy metabolism defects (10%), NBAS mutation (7%), Glycosylation Disorders (2%). In Group 2, the trigger was a viral infection, or a drug, deferasirox in three children. Univariate analysis showed that onset before 2 years-old, recurrent Reye and the association with rhabdomyolysis were significantly associated with IMD. Blood ammonia was a poor discriminating marker. All children were admitted into the intensive care unit, 23% needed continuous venovenous hemodialysis and one died from brain oedema.
   Conclusion: Metabolic tests should be performed early in all cases of Reye, regardless of triggers. As they can be inconclusive, we suggest to systematically go to Next-Generation Sequencing study. These children should be transferred early to a specialized unit. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI Synthesis of highly dispersed gold nanoparticles on
   Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 for
   the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol under low metal loadings
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB We reported the organic template-free synthesis of gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) supported on TiO2, SiO2, and Al2O3 displaying uniform Au sizes and high dispersions over the supports. The Au-based catalysts were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method using urea as the precipitating agent. In the next step, the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol was investigated as model reaction using only 0.08-0.05mol% of Au loadings and oxygen (O-2) as the oxidant. Very high catalytic performances (TOF up to 443,624h(-1)) could be achieved. Specifically, we investigated their catalytic activities, selectivity, and stabilities as well as the role of metal-support interactions over the performances. The conversion of the substrate was found to be associated with the nature of the employed support as the Au NPs presented similar sizes in all materials. A sub-stoichiometric amount of base was sufficient for the catalyst activation and the observation of the catalysts profile over the time enable insights on their recyclability performances. We believe this reported method represents a facile approach for the synthesis of uniform Au-supported catalysts displaying high performances.

TI Inclusion of the in-chain sulfur in 3-thiaCTU increases the efficiency
   of mitochondrial targeting and cell killing by anticancer aryl-urea
   fatty acids
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Mitochondria in tumor cells are functionally different from those in normal cells and could be targeted to develop new anticancer agents. We showed recently that the aryl-ureido fatty acid CTU is the prototype of a new class of mitochondrion-targeted agents that kill cancer cells by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress and promoting apoptosis. However, prolonged treatment with high doses of CTU were required for in vivo anti-tumor activity. Thus, new strategies are now required to produce agents that have enhanced anticancer activity over CTU. In the present study we prepared a novel aryl-urea termed 3-thiaCTU, that contained an in-chain sulfur heteroatom, for evaluation in tumor cell lines and in mice carrying tumor xenografts. The principal finding to emerge was that 3-thiaCTU was several-fold more active than CTU in the activation of aryl-urea mechanisms that promoted cancer cell killing. Thus, in in vitro studies 3-thiaCTU disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS production, activated ER -stress and promoted tumor cell apoptosis more effectively than CTU. 3-ThiaCTU was also significantly more active than CTU in vivo in mice that carried MDA-MB-231 cell xenografts. Compared to CTU, 3-thiaCTU pre-vented tumor growth more effectively and at much lower doses. These findings indicate that, in comparison to CTU, 3-thiaCTU is an aryl-urea with markedly enhanced activity that could now be suitable for development as a novel anticancer agent.

TI Hydrogen-Atom Transfer (HAT) Initiated by Intramolecular Ligand-Metal
   Electron Transfer
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) is of key importance for several catalytic and biological processes, and provides an elegant access to C-H activation. In synthetic chemistry, a photoactivated metal complex is often employed to abstract an oxygen- or nitrogen-bound hydrogen, and the as-generated oxygen- or nitrogen-centered radical is the hydrogen-atom acceptor for HAT. Here, we report the first examples for HAT processes initiated by one-electron oxidation of urea azines. A further novelty is that the HAT-initiating oxidation can be realized by intramolecular ligand-metal electron transfer in copper(II)-urea azine complexes. These complexes are first characterized in the solid state, in which they are stable. Electron-transfer-initiated HAT processes are observed upon dissolving the complexes in organic solvents, and the kinetics of these processes varies with the solvent polarity. The carbon-centered radicals formed by HAT can either be trapped with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) or undergo radical recombination reactions with itself, yielding diamagnetic end-products.

TI Emissions intensity and carbon stocks of a tropical Ultisol after
   amendment with Tithonia green manure, urea and biochar
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Biochar has been shown to reduce soil emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in short-term incubation and greenhouse experiments. Such controlled experiments failed to represent variable field conditions, and rarely included crop growth feedback. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of biochar, in comparison to green manure and mineral nitrogen, on greenhouse gas Emissions Intensity (EI = emissions in CO2 equivalents per ton of grain yield) in a low -fertility tropical Ultisol. Using a field trial in western Kenya, biochar (0 and 2.5 t ha(-1); made from Eucalyptus wood) was integrated with urea (0 and 120 kg N ha(-1)) and green manure (Tithonia diversifolia; 0, 2.5 and 5 t ha -1) in a factorial design for four consecutive seasons from October 2012 to August 2014. Compared to the control, biochar increased soil CO2 emissions (9-33%), reduced soil CH4 uptake (7-59%) and reduced soil N2O emissions (1-42%) in each season, with no seasonal differences. N2O emissions increased following amendment with T. diversifolia (6%) and urea (13%) compared to the control. Generally, N2O emissions decreased where only biochar was applied. The greatest decrease in N2O (42%) occurred where all three amendments were applied compared to when they were added separately. EI in response to any of the amendments was lower than the control, ranging from 9 to 65% (33.0 3.2 = mean SE): The amendments increased SOC stocks by 0.1-1.2 t ha(-1) year(-1) (mean SE of 0.8 0.09 t ha(-1) year(-1)). The results suggest decreased net EI with biochar in low fertility soils mainly through greater net primary productivity (89% of the decrease).

TI Seasonal behavior of water-soluble organic nitrogen in fine particulate
   matter (PM2.5) at urban coastal environments in Hong Kong
SO AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
AB Water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was determined at urban coastal environments in China based on 1-year measurement. The WSON concentrations were in a range of 14.3-257.6 nmol Nm(-3) and accounted for 22.0-61.2% of the water-soluble nitrogen (WSN) in composition. The average total concentration of free amino acid (FAA) was 1264.5 +/- 393.0 pmol m(-3), which was lower than those in continental urban cities but nevertheless comparable to the rural area of Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China. The total quantified amines and amino compounds ranged from 223.8 to 806.0 pmol m(-3) in which methylamine, ethylamine, and ethanolamine were the most abundant compounds. The average concentration of urea was 7.8 +/- 3.0 nmol m(-3) and at least one order of magnitude higher than those in marine and rural areas but comparable to other continental cities in China during non-dust period. Summer showed the highest average concentration of WSON (95.0 +/- 66.6 nmol N m(-3)) and composition in WSN (49.3%) compared to other seasons (27.9-37.0%). The results were consistent with previous findings that the inorganics can contribute more than the organics in secondary aerosol formation. There were no distinctive seasonal variations of organic compositions of FAA, amine and amino compounds, and urea. This observation was possibly attributed to a mix of original sources in urban and different prevailing wind directions. Fair correlations (r<0.4) between WSON compounds and atmospheric oxidants [ozone (O-3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)] suggest that biogenic oxidation is possibly not a major contributing factor in atmospheric coastal urban location.

TI Choice of precipitant and calcination temperature of precursor for
   synthesis of NiCo2O4 for control of
   CO-CH4 emissions from CNG vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Compressed natural gas (CNG) is most appropriate an alternative of conventional fuel for automobiles. However, emissions of carbon-monoxide and methane from such vehicles adversely affect human health and environment. Consequently, to abate emissions from CNG vehicles, development of highly efficient and inexpensive catalysts is necessary. Thus, the present work attempts to scan the effects of precipitants (Na2CO3, KOH and urea) for nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) catalysts prepared by co-precipitation from nitrate solutions and calcined in a lean CO-air mixture at 400 degrees C. The catalysts were used for oxidation of a mixture of CO and CH4 (1: 1). The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffractometer, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface-area, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; temperature programmed reduction and Scanning electron microscopy coupled with Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy. The Na2CO3 was adjudged as the best precipitant for production of catalyst, which completely oxidized CO-CH4 mixture at the lowest temperature (T-100 = 350 degrees C). Whereas, for catalyst prepared using urea, T-100 = 362 degrees C. On the other hand the conversion of CO-CH4 mixture over the catalyst synthesized by KOH limited to 97% even beyond 400 degrees C. Further, the effect of higher calcination temperatures of 500 and 600 degrees C was examined for the best catalyst. The total oxidation of the mixture was attained at higher temperatures of 375 and 410 degrees C over catalysts calcined at 500 and 600 degrees C respectively. Thus, the best precipitant established was Na2CO3 and the optimum calcination temperature of 400 degrees C was found to synthesize the NiCo2O4 catalyst for the best performance in CO-CH4 oxidation.

TI Corrosion behavior and adhesion strength of PEO/Epoxy duplex coating
   applied on aluminum alloy
SO ANTI-CORROSION METHODS AND MATERIALS
AB Purpose This paper aims to increase protection behavior of epoxy coating on aluminum alloys with plasma electrolitic oxidation (PEO) process as pretreatment and to investigate the corrosion properties of duplex coating system on aluminum alloy. Design/methodology/approach The study used micro structure study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigation, water uptake investigation and pull-off test. Findings This study was done to investigate the effect of urea as an additive, which alters the current density and time of process parameters in the protective performance of epoxy coating on the aluminum substrate. The protective behavior of double-layer coatings was examined using EIS in 3.5 per cent NaCl solution. In addition, the adhesion strength of double-layer coatings was evaluated using pull-off test, and the results demonstrated that the adhesion strength of sample with higher content of urea and current density is about two times that of sample without PEO preparation. Originality/value The protective properties and adhesion strength of epoxy coating can be increased with PEO pretreatment.

TI Unveiling the structural behavior of bimetallic AuCu/TiO2 catalysts in
   the CO oxidation: A combined in-situ spectroscopic and theoretical study
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Bimetallic AuCu/TiO2 catalysts were thoroughly studied during the CO oxidation reaction via three in-situ spectroscopic techniques (FTIR, UV-Vis and Raman) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Samples were synthesized through the deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) method, and ex-situ characterized by several techniques. The superior catalytic activity displayed by the AuCu/TiO2 sample was associated with the presence of nanoparticles in the form of heterodimers composed of the Au and CuXO phases in close interaction with the TiO2 support. In-situ DRIFTS results indicated that gold nanoparticles (NPs) presented some restructuration in the monometallic sample, while this event did not occur in the bimetallic one. The better stability on the AuCu/TiO2 catalyst was related to the partial migration of CuXO species to the surface of the NPs, also confirmed through in-situ UV-Vis spectroscopy. The favorable role played by the TiO2 reducibility was established through in-situ Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, findings obtained by DFT confirmed the experimentally evidenced structural modifications.

AB A new synthetic method of urea derivatives using copper and air was developed. These mild conditions provided moderate to very good yields for 15 examples (53-93%), while low yields were obtained with sterically hindered substrates (3 examples). The reaction was found to go through an in situ generated copper-N-heterocyclic carbene, which was then oxidized into cyclic urea derivatives possessing alkyl, benzyl, aryl, hydroxy, Boc-protected, and tertiary amine groups.

TI Low-oxidation-potential thiophene-carbazole monomers for
   electro-oxidative molecular imprinting: Selective chemosensing of
   aripiprazole
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB New thiophene-carbazole functional and cross-linking monomers electropolymerizing at potentials sufficiently low for molecular imprinting of an electroactive aripiprazole antipsychotic drug were herein designed and synthesized. Numerous conducting molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) films are deposited by electro-polymerization at relatively low potentials by electm-oxidation of pyrmle, aniline, phenol, or 3,4-ethylenediox-ythiophene (EDOT). However, their interactions with templates are not sufficiently strong. Hence, it is necessary to introduce additional recognizing sites in these cavities to increase their affinity to the target molecules. For that, functional monomers derivatized with substituents forming stable complexes with the templates are used. However, oxidation potentials of these derivatives are often, disadvantageously, higher than that of parent monomers. Therefore, we designed and synthesized new functional and cross-linking monomers, which are oxidized at sufficiently low potentials. The deposited MIP and non-imprinted polymer (NIP) films were characterized by PM-IRRAS and UV-vis spectroscopy and imaged with AFM. The structure of the aripiprazole prepolymerization complex with functional monomers was optimized with density functional theory (DFT), and aripiprazole interactions with imprinted cavities were simulated with molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD). MIP-aripiprazole film-coated electrodes were used as extended gates for selective determination of aripiprazole with the extended-gate field-effect transistor (EG-FET) chemosensor. The linear dynamic concentration range was 30-300 pM, and the limit of detection was 22 fM. An apparent imprinting factor of the MIP-1 was IF = 4.95. The devised chemosensor was highly selective to glucose, urea, and creatinine interferences. The chemosensor was successfully applied for aripiprazole determination in human plasma. The results obtained were compared to those of the validated HPLC-MS method.

TI SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION OF NO WITH AMMONIA AT LOW TEMPERATURE OVER
   CU-PROMOTED AND N-MODIFIED ACTIVATED CARBON
SO CHEMICAL AND PROCESS ENGINEERING-INZYNIERIA CHEMICZNA I PROCESOWA
AB Catalytic properties of activated carbons oxidized, treated with N-compounds, and promoted with copper were studied in selective catalytic reduction NOx by ammonia (NH3-SCR). The modification of the catalysts consisted of a series of steps (pre-oxidation of activated carbon, impregnation with urea, impregnation with copper). The physicochemical properties of the obtained samples were determined using X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, and low-temperature N-2 sorption. The modification with copper improved the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. All the functionalized carbon doped with copper reached more than 90% of NO conversion and CO2 did not exceed 240 ppm at 220 degrees C. The sample doped with 5 wt.% Cu had the maximum NO conversion of 98% at 300 degrees C. The maximum N2O concentration detected for the same sample was only 55 ppm, which confirmed its selectivity.

TI New insight into highly efficient CSA@g-C3N4 for
   photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and thioanisole: NAEDS as a
   promoter of photoactivity under blue LED irradiation
SO PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY
AB An open new perspective has been established toward synthesizing eco-friendly CSA@g-C-3 N-4 employing surface engineering. The carbon nitride modified through camphorsulfonic acid was designed and developed in a category of the new generation of photocatalysts for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol and thioanisole in the existence of a natural deep eutectic solvent (NADES). In comparison with pure g-C-3 N-4 , not only does CSA@g-C-3 N-4 exhibit an extraordinarily higher ability for harvesting visible light stemming from declining the recombination rate of electrons/holes dependent on PL results but it also reveals notable photocatalytic oxidation capability in the transformation of alcohols as well as thiols into relevant compounds. In addition, non-metal compound (CSA) incorporation would result in considerably diminishing the energy band gap value from 2.8 to 2.28 eV to escalate the visible-light absorption of g-C-3 N-4 . While the conventional consensus implies that inherent properties of photocatalysts bring on high photoactivity, this study indicates that deploying choline chloride-urea deep eutectic solvent as an external factor plays the role of photoactivity accelerator. Furthermore, readily recycling and reusability can be achieved for the photocatalytic setup of CSA@g-C-3 N-4 ascribed to its heterogeneous nature with no drop in the photoactivity.

TI Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate protects against renal-ischemia-reperfusion
   injury in a rat model via anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and
   anti-apoptosis
SO MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS
AB The present study aimed to investigate whether magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate protects against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (RIRI), and to verify the underlying mechanisms. An RIRI rat model was induced by removing the right kidney, and exposing and clamping the left kidney. RIRI model rats were administered 30 mg/kg magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate for 3 days. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels in the blood of RIRI model rat were examined, compared with sham-operated controls. Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate suppressed the activities of tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and caspase-3 in RIRI model rats. Renal iNOS, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, phosphorylated-signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein expression levels were suppressed by magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate treatment in RIRI model rats. These findings suggested that magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate protects RIRI via anti-inflammatory, -oxidative and-apoptotic mechanisms in an RIRI rat model. These results implicate magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate pretreatment as a potential approach to protect against RIRI via suppression of the iNOS, ICAM-1, MMP-2 and STAT3 signaling pathways.

TI Synergistic Coupling of NiTe Nanoarrays with FeOOH Nanosheets for Highly
   Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Hydrogen is the most promising alternative energy source in the face of energy crisis, and water splitting is a green strategy for hydrogen generation. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the essential half-reaction in electrochemical water splitting, and thus development and exploration of electrocatalysts with excellent performance are vital to prompt the application of OER. Due to the unique electronic properties of NiTe and strong synergistic interaction between NiTe and FeOOH, NiTe@FeOOH hybrid nanorods were successfully fabricated on Ni foams (NF) by a hydrothermal reaction step and another in-situ growth step for the first time without consuming any extra energy. The 3D structure of the NiTe@FeOOH/NF was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping technologies. Electrochemical measurements showed that the as-prepared NiTe@FeOOH/NF needs only an overpotential of 241 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and requires 1.341 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with a 0.33 M urea, showing excellent long-term stability. The NiTe@FeOOH/NF as the bifunctional electrocatalyst in an electrolyzer shows high efficiency with a cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work can provide a new efficient method to construct highly active and cost-effective OER catalysts.

TI Effect of different ammonia sources on aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic
   methanogens
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was usually used as a model ammonia source to simulate ammonia inhibition during anaerobic digestion (AD) of nitrogen-rich feedstocks. However, ammonia in AD originates mainly from degradation of proteins, urea and nucleic acids, which is distinct from NH4Cl. Thus, in this study, the inhibitory effect of a "natural" ammonia source (urea) and NH4Cl, on four pure methanogenic strains (aceticlastic: Methanosarcina thermophila, Methanosarcina barkeri; hydrogenotrophic: Methanoculleus bourgensis, Methanoculleus thermophilus), was assessed under mesophilic (37 degrees C) and thermophilic (55 degrees C) conditions. The results showed that urea hydrolysis increased pH significantly to unsuitable levels for methanogenic growth, while NH4Cl had a negligible effect on pH. After adjusting initial pH to 7 and 8, urea was significantly stronger inhibitor with longer lag phases to methanogenesis compared to NH4Cl. Overall, urea seems to be more toxic on both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens compared to NH4Cl under the same total and free ammonia levels.

AB The objective of this work was to study the degradation and mineralization of ethylenethiourea (ETU) in water by ozonation at different pH values and in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Degradation experiments were performed using an initial ETU concentration of 50 ppm for 180 min with a gas flux of 0.25 dm(3) min(-1) and an O-3 production rate of 12.1 mg min(-1). Degradation of by-products was monitored by direct injection electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), ETU concentration was determined by HPLC-UV, and its mineralization was detected by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. Optimum degradation of ETU in water was observed at pH = 11, whereas at pH = 3, the degradation of ETU was slowest, indicating that the reaction occurred through different mechanisms. The additional effects of hydroxyl radicals formed at the highest pH can be used to explain the results obtained in this study. Peroxone experiments were carried out in the presence of 400 and 800 mg L-1 H2O2; the degradation of ETU was faster at 400 mg L-1 H2O2. This was attributed to the scavenging effect of the excess H2O2. ETU treatment by ozonation produced several by-products of degradation such as ethylene urea and 2-imidazoline.

TI New Nanosilver/Ceria Catalyst for Atmospheric Pollution Treatment
SO NANO
AB Mesoporous CeO2 was synthesized by the nanocasting pathway using the mesoporous SBA-15 silica as structure template and cerium nitrate as the CeO2 precursor via a solid-liquid route. Ag/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by three di r erent methods: wetness impregnation (WI), deposition- precipitation with urea (DPU) and impregnation-reduction with citrate (IRC), with a loading of silver of 4 wt.%. They were characterized by elemental analysis, H-2-TPR, X-ray powder di r raction (XRD), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area, di r use reflectance and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (DR/UV-Vis). Ag/CeO2 catalysts retain the physical properties of mesoporous ceria and its hexagonal order. Catalytic oxidation of propylene and catalytic reduction of NO with propylene as a reducing agent were investigated on Ag/mesoporous ceria catalysts. The silver/mesoporous ceria system toward the deep oxidation of propylene and the catalytic reduction of NO depends on the catalyst preparation method. Ag/CeO2 (IRC) can be ascribed to higher surface lattice oxygen mobility over this catalyst and also to the strong interaction between silver and mesoporous ceria.

TI Synthesis of hydrous cobalt phosphate electro-catalysts by a facile
   hydrothermal method for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction: effect of
   urea variation
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB In this report, highly active hydrous cobalt phosphate thin film electro-catalysts were synthesized by a low cost and one-pot hydrothermal method at 393 K and were evaluated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The impact of varying the hydrolyzing agent, urea, on the structural and morphological properties of hydrous cobalt phosphate thin films and the consequent electro-catalytic performances was studied. The morphology of hydrous cobalt phosphate thin films resembles a microflower-like structure consisting of microplates. Upon urea variation, the microplates undergo changes in thickness and width and eventually transform into microflakes. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance of hydrous cobalt phosphate thin films was observed towards the OER and they exhibit a low overpotential of 292 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density with a Tafel slope of 98 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Also, the stability of the electrocatalyst is demonstrated by continued electrolysis, showing that the hydrous cobalt phosphate thin film electro-catalyst sustains superior long-term electrochemical stability for 10 h at 10 mA cm(-2) constant current density. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of hydrous cobalt phosphate thin film electro-catalysts was attributed to a high ECSA (1210 cm(-2)) and low electrochemical impedance imparted by the microflower structure with microflake-like morphology.

TI Ultrasmall FeMoNi Tri-Metal nanoparticles confined by tannic
   acid-derived carbon as bi-functional electrocatalyst for oxygen
   evolution and urea oxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB Exploration of the electrocatalysts with uniformly dispersed metal nanoparticles (NPs) is important to achieve high electrocatalytic activity, but the NPs always trend to aggregate during fabrication or application. Herein, ultrasmall FeMoNi tri-metal NPs was confined by tannic acid-derived carbon layer and utilized as bi-functional electrocatalyst. The interconnected nanosheets network with open porous structure and electrolyte/gas diffusion channels can reduce the mass transfer resistance. The tri-metal NPs with average diameter of only 11.9 nm are uniformly distributed between the space limited carbon interlayer to avoid aggregation and provide enhanced electric conductivity. Meanwhile, the physical carbon armor and electron tunneling effect can enhance the alkali resistance and electrocatalytic activity/stability of the electrocatalyst. Therefore, the optimized C@FeMoNi/CC electrode can achieve overpotential of 244 mV and potential of 1.4 V at 10 mA cm (2) for OER and UOR, respectively, and high long-term cyclic stability for 40 h. Moreover, the high-valence NiFe species are considered as the highly active centers. This plant polyphenol derived surface coating and carbonization strategy with controllable functional building blocks provides a solution for the rational design of energy conversion devices.

TI Maximized Schottky Effect: The Ultrafine V2O3/Ni
   Heterojunctions Repeatedly Arranging on Monolayer Nanosheets for
   Efficient and Stable Water-to-Hydrogen Conversion
SO SMALL
AB The Mott-Schottky heterojunction formed at the interface of ultrafine metallic Ni and semiconducting V2O3 nanoparticles is constructed, and the heterojunctions are "knitted" into the tulle-like monolayer nanosheets on nickel foam (NF). The greatly reduced particle sizes of both Ni and V2O3 on the Mott-Schottky heterojunction highly enhance the number of Schottky heterojunctions per unit area of the materials. Moreover, arranging the heterojunctions into the monolayer nanosheets makes the heterojunctions repeat and expose to the electrolyte sufficiently. The Schottky heterojunctions are like countless self-powered charge transfer workstations embedded in the tulle-like monolayer nanosheets, promoting maximum of the materials to participate into the electron transfer and become catalytic active sites. In addition, the tulle-like monolayer nanosheet structure can assist in pumping liquid phase electrolyte to the surface of catalysts, owing to the capillary force. The V2O3/Ni/NF Mott-Schottky catalyst exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low eta(10) of 54 mV and needs -107 mV to get the current density of -100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, V2O3/Ni/NF Schottky electrocatalyst exhibits excellent urea oxidation reaction activity: 1.40, 1.51, and 1.61 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) voltage are required to reach a current density of 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively.

TI Efficient treatment of swimming pool water by photoelectrocatalytic
   ozonation: Inactivation of Candida parapsilosis and
   mineralization of Benzophenone-3 and urea
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Swimming pool water (SPW) poses a potential risk to both human health and the environment due to the presence of contaminants of emerging concern (including components of sunscreens), pathogenic microorganisms, and eventually products of the reaction of chlorine with urea, such as chloramines, which are found in the water. The present work describes the efficient combination of photoelectrocatalysis and ozonation (PEC + O-3) to treat both simulated and real contaminated pool water. An annular bubble reactor was designed based on a cylindrical TiO2 nanotubes electrode irradiated by an UVB 36 W lamp with an injection of ozone/air. Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) was used as a model of harmful commercial sunscreen to test the reactor efficiency. The results showed that O-3-based treatment efficiently oxidized BP-3 (100% in 20 min) but reached only 32% of mineralization after 120 min of treatment, whereas O-3 + PEC-based treatment reached 82% of TOC removal (with 100% BP-3 removal in 20 min). The addition of 10(6) CFU mL(-1) of Candida parapsilosis did not interfere in BP-3 mineralization, and the fungus was found to be completely inactivated after 45 min of treatment. Furthermore, the presence of urea (10 and 20 mg L-1) was not found to exert any significant influence over BP-3 degradation. The method was successfully applied in real SPW sample fortified with 10.0 mg L-1 of Benzophenone-3. The findings show that O-3 + PEC-based treatment could be a good alternative for SPW treatment, once it leads to efficient disinfection and mineralization of harmful organic compounds.

TI Catalytic activity of ethylbenzene with product selectivity by gold
   nanoparticles supported on zinc oxide
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The oxidation of ethylbenzene (EB) using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as the oxidizing agent was carried out in presence of gold nanoparticles (3 nm) supported on zinc oxide in acetonitrile solution. A higher selectivity towards acetophenone (ACP) as the major product, and a moderate selectivity towards other products such as 1-phenylethanol (PE), benzaldehyde (BZL), and benzoic acid (BzA) were observed using the prepared Au/ZnO nanocatalysts at 100 degrees C for 24 h. It is suggested the reaction produces an intermediate product, which is dimethylethyl-1-phenylethyl peroxide through a radical mechanism. A small amount of benzaldehyde was observed because benzaldehyde went autoxidation to form benzoic acid with the presence of oxidation agent of TBHP during reaction. The factors affecting the catalytic activity such as gold loading, calcination treatment at 300 degrees C, type of solvent, reaction time, reaction temperature, oxidant to substrate molar ratio, catalyst weight, and solvent volume were studied. The gold nanoparticle catalyst synthesized by deposition precipitation method using urea was characterized by XRD, HRTEM, ATR-IR, XRF, and BET and offers a very selective reaction pathway for the oxidation of ethylbenzene.

TI Maximization of the photocatalytic degradation of diclofenac using
   polymeric g-C3N4 by tuning the precursor and the synthetic protocol
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB A green-oriented synthesis of highly photoactive nano-scaled graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is presented with water to be utilized as a critical reagent in order to tune desired physicochemical properties, and so, to elevate the photocatalytic activity. The materials' optimization strategy involved the use of three precursors (melamine, urea or thiourea) and different thermal polycondensation (pyrolysis) durations. The synthesized materials were characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, N2 sorption, FT-IR, and UV-vis DRS. Their photocatalytic activity against a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical compound, diclofenac, was evaluated under ultraviolent irradiation, also investigating the influence of pH, photocatalyst dosage/mass and concentration of H2O2. The results revealed that the precursor, pyrolysis time and use of water effect significantly the physicochemical features and the photocatalytic activity. Urea-derived samples showed the highest specific surface areas and smallest crystalline domains, as well as the highest photocatalytic efficiency. The involved mechanisms were examined by exploring the optical properties, the role of the photo-generated radicals and the reactive oxygen species, as well as LC-MS analysis. The Orbitrap high-resolution mass-spectrometry analysis revealed the formation of 26 transformation products governed by different processes such as hydroxylation and further oxidation to keto derivatives and ring opening, decarboxylation/hydroxylation with further oxidation, dichlorination, and lactam formation.

TI Deep eutectic solvent system based on choline chloride-urea as a
   pre-treatment for nanofibrillation of wood cellulose
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are promising novel chemicals that can function as solvents, reagents, and catalysts in many applications because they are readily available, have low toxicity, are biodegradable, and exhibit negligible vapor pressure. In this study, a DES of choline chloride-urea (molar ratio of 1 : 2) was used as a non-hydrolytic pre-treatment media to promote nanofibrillation of birch cellulose pulp using a microfluidizer. The DES pre-treatment was conducted at 100 degrees C, and then DES was removed by washing with water. Three degrees of mechanical treatment with the microfluidizer for DES pre-treated cellulose pulp were conducted and their effects on the fiber properties were studied. Cellulose fibers were observed to disintegrate into nanofibril bundles with widths ranging from 15 to 200 nm and to individual cellulose nanofibrils with widths of 2-5 nm. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and degree of polymerization analysis using the limiting viscosity method revealed that both the cellulose crystalline structure and the degree of polymerization of the cellulose remained intact after pre-treatment with DES.

TI Efficient strategy for significantly decreasing overpotentials of
   hydrogen generation via oxidizing small molecules at flexible
   bifunctional CoSe electrodes
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB In this study, we adopt an efficient strategy to replace conventional oxygen evolution reaction with small molecules thermodynamically more readily oxidizable species. Hydrazine, ethanol, glycol and urea can be easily oxidized than oxygen evolution reaction, but the lack of low-cost and efficient small molecules oxidation reaction electrocatalysts places constraints on their development. Herein, a flexible electrode based on cobalt selenide nanosheet arrays supported on carbon fiber paper (CoSe/CFP) is prepared through a two-step approach. The as obtained CoSe/CFP is efficient for small molecules electrooxidation reaction at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode. Due to the easier oxidation of hydrazine than other species, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is investigated in details. An assembled electrolytic cell based on the hydrazine oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrodes provides a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 0.5 V, long-term durability and 98% Faradaic efficiencies. This novel strategy can greatly lower the imput cell voltage than that under full water splitting (1.6-2.0 V) for cost-effective and energy-saving hydrogen production.

TI Dramatic promotion of visible-light photoreactivity of TiO2
   hollow microspheres towards NO oxidation by introduction of oxygen
   vacancy
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Hollow-structured TiO2 has attracted much attention owing to its low density, good light-reflecting ability, and excellent permeability. However, the wide bandgap (about 3.2 eV for anatase TiO2) and fast recombination of photo-generated carriers hamper its practical application. Herein, oxygen vacancy (O-v) was introduced onto the surface of TiO2 hollow microspheres (TiO2-HMSs) by a facile method through calcination of the mixture of hydrogen titanate hollow microspheres (H-2 TiO3 -HMSs) and urea. Using this strategy, both the aims of extending the light-response range and promoting the separation of photo-generated carriers were satisfactorily achieved. The introduction of Ov facilitates the adsorption and activation of NO and O-2 on the surface of TiO2-HMSs. This stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radicals (O-center dot(2)-) and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), resulting in the dramatic promotion of visible-light photocatalytic oxidation of NO.

TI N-Doped Graphene from Metal-Organic Frameworks for Catalytic Oxidation
   of p-HydroxylbenzoicL Acid: N-Functionality and Mechanism
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB N-doped graphene has been considered as a promising catalyst with surface metal-free active sites for environmental remediation. Several MIL-100 (Fe)-templated N-doped graphene samples were synthesized using dicyandiamide, melamine, and urea as the nitrogen precursors. Excellent catalytic oxidation of p-hydroxylbenzoic acid (PHBA) was observed on the as-synthesized samples via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The mechanism was investigated by both electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, 5,5dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinol as the trapping agents) and quenching tests (ethanol and sodium azide as the radical scavengers). Benzoic acid and furfuryl alcohol were also employed as probing reagents for hydroxyl/sulfate radicals and singlet oxygen, respectively. The results confirmed that singlet oxygen was generated and dominated the PHBA degradation on N-doped graphene, rather than hydroxyl/sulfate radicals. With the novel N-doped graphene, this study illustrates the formation mechanism of nitrogen functionalities for reactive radicals via PMS activation for removal of organic contaminants in water.

TI Facile fabrication of palladium-ionic liquids-nitrogen-doped graphene
   nanocomposites as enhanced electro-catalyst for ethanol oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The palladium-ionic liquids-nitrogen-doped graphene nanocomposites are facile fabricated as enhanced electro-catalyst for ethanol oxidation. First, the ionic liquids functionalized nitrogen-doping graphene nanosheets (PDIL-NGS) with few layers is synthesized through a facile and effective one-pot hydrothermal method with graphene oxide as raw material, urea as reducing-doping agents and ionic liquids (ILs) derived from 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid as functional molecules. The results of systematic characterization reveal that the PDIL molecules not only can functionalize NGS by pi-pi stacking with no affecting the nitrogen doping but also prevent the agglomeration of NGS. More importantly, the processing performance and the property of electron transfer are remarkably enhanced duo to introducing a large number of ILs groups. Then, the enhanced electrocatalytic Pd nanoparticles are successfully anchored on PDIL-NGS by a facile and surfactant-free synthetic technique. As an anode catalyst, the novel catalyst exhibits better kinetics, more superior electrocatalytic performance, higher tolerance and electrochemical stability than the other catalysts toward ethanol electrooxidation, owing to the role of PDIL molecules. Therefore, the new catalyst is believed to have the potential use for direct alcohol fuel cells in the future and the functionalized NGS is promising useful materials applied in other fields.

TI Solvent-free in situ synthesis of
   g-C3N4/{001}TiO2 composite with
   enhanced UV- and visible-light photocatalytic activity for NO oxidation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Many possible applications of anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {0 01} facets ({0 01}TiO2) are limited by its low quantum efficiency and no-spectral response in the visible region. We report on a simple solvent-free in situ method for synthesizing g-C3N4/{001}TiO2 composite that over comes these drawbacks. The in situ growth of g-C3N4 and the removal of F- ions on the {0 0 1}TiO2 surface that remain from the synthesis process were simultaneously achieved during the calcination of a mixture of prepared {0 0 1}TiO2 and urea, resulting in a compact connection between the two components, which facilitated the interfacial charge transfer process. The growth of g-C3N4 during the calcination process preserved the {0 0 1} facets of TiO2. The composite samples exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than either the pure g-C3N4 or {0 0 1}TiO2 nanosheets separately. Specifically, as measured by the removal of NO, the optimal composite sample, with a g-C3N4 content of 10%, was 2.4 times more effective than pure {0 0 1}TiO2, 4.1 times more effective than g-C3N4 under UV light, and 5.8 times more effective than g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. Also, the composite prepared by this method showed much higher activity than similar composites that were prepared by evaporation and mechanical methods. The new method is simple and holds the promise of expanded large-scale production and wider use of {0 0 1}TiO2 based catalysts in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of urea-N and CO2 coupling fertilization on the
   growth, photosynthesis, yield and anthocyanin content of hydroponic
   purple cabbage Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Water and fertilizer coupling is a high-efficiency technology for the development of facility agriculture. However, the interaction effect of nitrogen (N) and air carbon dioxide (CO2) on hydroponic purple cabbage, especially on its leaf anthocyanins under hydroponic solution systems, remains unexplored. In this study, six treatments were set as C0N0, C0N2, C0N4, C1N0, C1N2 and C1N4, with N0, N2 and N4 being 0.0 g/L, 0.2 g/L and 0.4 g/L exogenous urea-N to hydroponic solution dilution, respectively. C0 and C1 were set as with and without CO2 fertilizer (i.e., 800 g CO2 agent added one week after transplanting and 600 g CO2 agent added when the plant reached 15 cm in height), respectively. Pot experiments were conducted to investigate the interaction effect of N and air CO2 (NxCO(2)) on the growth, photosynthesis, yield and anthocyanin content of hydroponic purple cabbage Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis. The results showed NxCO(2) extremely significantly influenced plant height (H), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), intercellular oxidation concentration (Ci), transpiration rate (Tr), leaf water use efficiency (LWUE) and yield. The C1N0 treatment had the largest yield at 262.5 g/plant, with higher values for root length, root weight, plant height and leaf number than the other treatments. The Pn, Ci and Tr of C1N4 were the highest at 3.05 mu mol CO2/m(2)center dot s, 352.8 mu mol CO2/m(2)center dot s and 2.31 mmol H2O/m(2)center dot s, respectively. The C1N2 treatment received the largest Gs value of 0.70 mol H2O/m(2)center dot s and the largest Tr of 2.31 mmol H2O/m(2)center dot s. There was the highest LWUE for C0N2 (1.41) and the highest anthocyanin content for C1N2 (1.35 mg/kg). There was a significant negative correlation between leaf number and anthocyanin (r = -0.414, p<0.05). The findings demonstrated that adding CO2 fertilizer and 0.2 g/L exogenous urea-N to hydroponic solution dilution is a potential NxCO(2) coupling strategy to increase anthocyanin and the yield of purple cabbage.

TI Wheat straw mulching with nitrification inhibitor application improves
   grain yield and economic benefit while mitigating gaseous emissions from
   a dryland maize field in northwest China
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Understanding the comprehensive impact of soil mulching and nitrogen (N) fertilization on agronomy, economy and environment is important for developing sustainable dryland agriculture. A two-year experiment was conducted on dryland maize (Zea mays L.) in a sub-humid but drought-prone climate zone to explore the responses of grain yield, N use efficiency (NUE), economic benefit, ammonia (NH3) volatilization and greenhouse gas emissions to various mulching methods (NM: non-mulching, SM: wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw mulching and RF: ridge-furrow cultivation with plastic film mulching on the ridge) and N types (U: urea, U + CRU: mixture of urea and controlled-release urea at a ratio of 3:7, U + DMPP: urea with 2 % 3, 4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate and U + NBPT: urea with 2 % N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide). The results showed that RF and SM significantly increased grain yield and NUE, and decreased residual soil mineral N in the 0-200 cm soil layer relative to NM, but the differences in these indices were not significant between RF and SM. The net benefit under SM was comparable to that under RF (1558.5 and 1613.6 USD ha(-1)). The RF treatment significantly increased global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) by 33.7 % and 20.4 % compared with NM, and by 71.9 % and 67.5 % compared with SM. Compared with urea, U + CRU, U + DMPP and U + NBPT exhibited promoting effect on grain yield and NUE, but decreased residual soil mineral N. Compared with U, U + NBPT and U + DMPP produced much lower NH3 volatilization and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, respectively. Compared with U, U + CRU also reduced NH3 volatilization and N2O emission, but its economic benefit was 4.9 % lower. Both U + DMPP and U + NBPT exhibited inhibitory effect on methane (CH4) oxidation, but the CH4 pattern under U + CRU was inconsistent in the two years. The smallest GWP and GHGI were generally observed under U + DMPP among various N types. The interaction of mulching method and N type had significant influence on grain yield in 2019, CO2 emission in 2018, N2O emission, GWP and GHGI in both years. In conclusion, wheat straw mulching with nitrification inhibitor application achieved better balance among agronomic, economic and environmental benefits for dryland maize in northwest China.

TI Effects of High-Frequency Electrical Stunning Current Intensities on
   Pre-Slaughter Stunning Stress and Meat Lipid Oxidation in Geese
SO ANIMALS
AB Simple Summary China produces the largest number of meat-producing geese in the world. However, few studies have investigated the effects of electrical stunning parameters on stunning stress or meat lipid oxidation in geese. We aimed to evaluate the stunning stress and meat lipid oxidation in geese stunned at a high electrical frequency level with different electrical current intensities in a water bath. Stunning the geese at 40 mA resulted in the minimum stunning stress based on the gene expression and hormones released in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Stunning geese with 40 mA resulted in low stunning stress and lipid oxidation in breast meat (d 2), with moderate antioxidant capacity in the meat of the breast (d 2) and thigh (d 0) as compared with 100 mA. A combination of 40 mA, 500 Hz, 10 s per bird is suitable for the electrical stunning of geese and for the alleviation of stunning stress and meat lipid oxidation. This study may help to alleviate stunning stress and improve meat quality in the geese production industry. Intensive slaughtering with electrical stunning (ES) is replacing traditional manual slaughtering of geese in China. This study aimed to assess stunning stress and meat lipid oxidation in geese stunned by high-frequency current intensities. Forty male Yangzhou geese, 92 days old, were randomly allocated into five treatments with eight replicates per treatment. The geese in the control group were not stunned, while the other birds were stunned by alternating current (AC) in a water bath. Each bird received a current intensity of 20 mA (E20mA), 40 mA (E40mA), 70 mA (E70mA), or 100 mA (E100mA) for 10 s at 500 Hz. The gene expression of c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 tended to decrease in the E40mA birds (p = 0.08). Stunning with 40 mA resulted in the maximum serum uric acid and urea among the ES groups and decreased serum adrenocorticotropin and creatine kinase (p < 0.01) compared with 70 mA and 100 mA. Increasing the current intensity reduced the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl free radical elimination ability and total-superoxide dismutase linearly in goose breast meat at d 2 and in thigh meat at d 0 (all p < 0.01). Stunning geese with 40 mA at 500 Hz for 10 s could alleviate stunning stress and meat lipid oxidation.

TI The role of urea in regulating the structural properties of Zr-Sn-based
   oxide catalysts for direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from
   CO2 and methanol
SO REACTION CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB The aim of this work was to explore the influences of urea as a precipitant on the structural and catalytic performances of Zr-Sn-O catalysts for direct synthesis of DMC from CO2 and CH3OH. Zr-Sn-O catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, and N-2 adsorption. The results confirmed that urea used as a precipitant had a significant impact on the particle size, amount of oxygen vacancies, acid-base properties, BET surface area, pore structures and catalytic performances of the studied catalysts. The Zr-Sn-O-57.5 catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity with a DMC yield of 1.74 mmol g(cat)(-1) and methanol conversion of 0.28%. Furthermore, the catalytic performance of Zr-Sn-O catalysts is directly related to the BET surface area. Thus, this work provides a new strategy for preparing catalysts for the direct synthesis of DMC.

TI A universal approach to dual- metal- atom catalytic sites confined in
   carbon dots for various target reactions
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Here, a molecular- design and carbon dot- confinement coupling strategy through the pyrolysis of bimetallic complex of diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid under low- temperature is proposed as a universal approach to dual -metal -atom sites in carbon dots (DMASs-CDs). CDs as the "carbon islands" could block the migration of DMASs across "islands" to achieve dynamic stability. More than twenty DMASs-CDs with specific compositions of DMASs (pairwise combinations among Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Mo) have been synthesized successfully. Thereafter, high intrinsic activity is observed for the probe reaction of urea oxidation on NiMn-CDs. In situ and ex situ spectroscopic characterization and first- principle calculations unveil that the synergistic effect in NiMn-DMASs could stretch the urea molecule and weaken the N-H bond, endowing NiMn-CDs with a low energy barrier for urea dehydrogenation. Moreover, DMASs-CDs for various target electrochemical reactions, including but not limited to urea oxidation, are realized by optimizing the specific DMAS combination in CDs.

TI Phase and chemical state tuning of FeNi oxides for oxygen evolution
   reaction
SO SCIENCE CHINA-CHEMISTRY
AB Advancing and deploying the FeNi-based catalyst, the state-of-the-art pre-electrocatalysts, for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) still suffer from unclear chemical state correlation to the catalytic ability, as evidenced by the variedly reported performance for the different FeNi structures. Herein, we contributed the phase and redox chemical states tuning of FeNi oxides by the surface microenvironment regulation for the OER catalysis that was realized by the urea-assisted pyrolysis and molybdenum-doping technique by integrating molybdenum into the iron-nickel metal-organic precursor. Driven by the complicated and compromised atmosphere, namely, the oxidation state driven by the Mo doping and reduction ability induced by the urea-assisted pyrolysis, could transfer confined FeNi oxides to hybrid phases of Fe2O3 and FeNi3 alloy, and the resultant compromised chemical states by the charge redistribution imparted very high electrocatalytic performance for OER compared with the control samples. The in-situ Raman spectroscopy and post-XPS analysis confirmed the facile Fe/Ni oxyhydroxide active phase formation resulting from the proper phase and chemical states, and theoretical analysis disclosed the microenvironment regulation resulting in the charge redistribution forming the electron accumulation and depletion sites to accelerate the oxygen-species to oxyhydroxide-species transformation and enhance the electronic state density near the Fermi level by significantly reducing the energy barrier. The work not only showed the importance of surface chemical state tunning that can basically answer the varied performance of FeNi catalysts but also revealed an effective approach for fine-tuning their catalytic properties.

TI HKUST-1 catalyzed efficient in situ regeneration of
   NAD<SUP>+</SUP> for dehydrogenase mediated oxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB The combination of enzymatic and chemical reactions to achieve co-operative chemo-enzymatic processes has presented many challenges for decades. In this work, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was encapsulated into metal-organic framework HKUST-1 crystals through an in situ approach to construct a synergistic chemo- and bio-catalysis system, where ADH was for the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and HKUST-1 was in charge for the regeneration of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+), the oxidized cofactor). It was found that HKUST-1 was a versatile catalyst for efficient oxidation of NADH in different buffers. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters of immobilized ADH exhibited an increased K-M (approximately 1.3-fold) and a decreased V-max (approximately 4.7-fold) compared to free ADH. Due to the protection of HKUST-1, the immobilized enzyme showed a better resistance against urea and organic solvents compared with free enzyme, and still maintained 93% of its original activity after 6 cycles. The immobilized enzyme was successfully applied to the enzymatic transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in aqueous media at room temperature. Owing to the oxidized cofactor regeneration by HKUST-1, ADH@HKUST-1 composites achieved a benzaldehyde yield of 28.5%, which was approximately 4.3-fold higher than that of the individual bio-catalysis. This concept of combining chemo- and bio-catalysis may provide a novel and versatile technique for applications in biochemical catalysis, biosensors and drug delivery. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Electrocatalytic detection of nitrite at NiCo 2 O 4 nanotapes
   synthesized via microwave-hydrothermal method
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB NiCo2O4 nanotapes were obtained via a facile microwave assisted hydrothermal approach followed by calcination using urea and the metal nitrates without any structure directing agents. The material was characterized by XRD, SEM, FTIR, BET and XPS to ascertain its chemical and physical nature. The NiCo2O4 nanostructures were found to be crystalline with phase purity, composed of nanotapes formed by aggregates of numerous nanoparticles providing high surface area and porosity, chemically pure and with Ni and Co in multiple oxidation states. By virtue of all these properties NiCo2O4 nanotapes were catalytically active towards the oxidation of nitrite in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PBS) of pH 7.0. The kinetic and heterogeneous rate constants are relatively higher and indicate facile electron transfer between the NiCo2O4 electrode surface and nitrite ions. Experiments on electrochemical detection of nitrite with the proposed catalyst displayed a linear range of detection between 10 and 300 mu M with detection limit of 1.04 mu M and a sensitivity of 1.03 mu A mu M-1 cm-2.

TI Influence of the synthesis route on Au-Ir/Al2O3
   catalysts performing the total propane oxidation reaction at low
   temperature
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB The current study highlights synthesis as a key parameter for obtaining Au-Ir/Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts using the deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) method. Both co-deposition and sequential deposition (first by adding Au and then Ir and vice versa) were employed. These approaches were compared with the sol-gel and impregnation methods, revealing notable differences in the catalytic oxidation of C3H8 at low temperatures. The Au-Ir/ Al2O3 catalysts prepared via co-deposition and sequential deposition demonstrated outstanding results, producing nanoparticles as small as 1 nm when thermally reduced in hydrogen at 400 degrees C; also, these catalysts exhibited greater capacity for oxidizing C3H8 below 280 degrees C than the Ir/Al2O3 and Au/Al2O3-based catalysts. Characterization of the catalysts was conducted by employing various techniques, including in-situ DRIFTS, UVVis, BET, H2-TPR, HAADF-STEM-EDS, XPS and surface acidity determinations by pyridine thermo-desorption. This last technique showed differences in total acidity (Bro<spacing diaeresis>nsted and Lewis) provoked by the Au-Ir interaction in the different catalysts, which significantly influenced their ability to oxidize C3H8 towards CO2. The results emphasize the effectiveness of the co-deposition and sequential deposition methods using the DPU approach compared to the sol-gel and impregnation methods.

TI Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase ameliorates
   hyperhomocysteinemia-induced hepatic steatosis by enhancing β-oxidation
   of fatty acid in mice
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-GASTROINTESTINAL AND LIVER PHYSIOLOGY
AB Hepatic steatosis is the beginning phase of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a significant risk factor. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) hydrolyzes epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and other epoxy fatty acids, attenuating their cardiovascular protective effects. However, the involvement of sEH in HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis is unknown. The current study aimed to explore the role of sEH in HHcy-induced lipid disorder. We fed 6-wk-old male mice a chow diet or 2% (wt/wt) high-metnionine diet for 8 wk to establish the HHcy model. A high level of homocysteine induced lipid accumulation in vivo and in vitro, which was concomitant with the increased activity and expression of sEH. Treatment with a highly selective specific sEH inhibitor (0.8 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) for the animal model and 1 mu M for cells) prevented HHcy-induced lipid accumulation in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of sEH activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), as evidenced by elevated beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the expression of PPAR-alpha target genes in HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis. In primary cultured hepatocytes, the effect of sEH inhibition on PPAR-alpha activation was further confirmed by a marked increase in PPAR-response element luciferase activity, which was reversed by knock down of PPAR-alpha. Of note, 11,12-EET ligand dependently activated PPAR-alpha. Thus increased sEH activity is a key determinant in the pathogenesis of HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis, and sEH inhibition could be an effective treatment for HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the current study, we demonstrated that upregulation of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is involved in the hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-caused hepatic steatosis in an HHcy mouse model and in murine primary hepatocytes. Improving hepatic steatosis in HHcy mice by pharmacological inhibition of sEH to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha was ligand dependent, and sEH could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

TI Detoxification of municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) fly ash by
   single-mode microwave (MW) irradiation: Addition of urea on the
   degradation of Dioxin and mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB The detoxification of municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) fly ash dioxins urgently requires an effective treatment technology. In this study, we adopted a single-mode microwave (MW)-based pyrolysis to treat MSWI fly ash under N-2 atmosphere and further elucidated the main influencing factors, including the chemical inhibitor, for dioxin control. The results show that (1) the detoxification process was optimized with a mass ratio of fly ash to SiC of 1:9, 23.1% (wt%) urea addition and pyrolysis temperature of -480 degrees C; (2) the total polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) destruction efficiency and the bioassay-derived 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalent (Bio-TEQ) removal efficiency reached 98.5% and 97.9%, respectively, accompanied with 1.3% of the total amount of dioxin being submitted to exhaust gas; (3) the MW-based pyrolysis of urea (133-300 C) was favourable for the generation of hot spots as well as the PCDD/F rapid destruction in fly ash. In addition, the leaching toxicity of heavy metals was also partially reduced after MW pyrolysis reactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report adopting a MW-based pyrolysis to eliminate dioxin in MSWI fly ash with the addition of urea, which is a promising alternative to current methods.

TI Electrochemical oxidation of meglumine in a pharmaceutical formulation
   using a nanocomposite anode
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The electrocatalytic oxidation of meglumine and gadoterate meglumine (Gd-DOTA) on a TiO2-Ni(SO4)0.3(OH)1.4 composite anode was investigated in alkaline medium (5 M KOH) using cyclic voltammetry and chro-noamperometry. The composite was prepared by hydrothermal method and the morphology and structure of the produced nanoparticles were studied by scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectros-copy, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, BET surface area analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The characterization revealed the formation of Ni(SO4)0.3(OH)1.4 nanobelts dispersed on TiO2 nanoaggregates. The composite was coated onto a porous graphite rod, showing good adherence without requiring any binder (according to their anodic and cathodic charges). The supported composite was electro-catalytic, allowing the oxidation of meglumine, either as pure reagent or contained in gadoterate meglumine solutions. Electrochemical methods allowed determining the kinetic parameters, such as the electron transfer coefficient alpha, the total number of electrons n and the standard heterogeneous rate constant k0 for the reaction of meglumine. The chronoamperometric tests informed about the good stability of the composite anode upon meglumine oxidation at +0.6 V for 10 h. The electrochemical oxidation of meglumine in a commercial phar-maceutical formulation (Dotarem (R)) was corroborated via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

TI Foamer-Derived Bulk Nitrogen Defects and Oxygen-Doped Porous Carbon
   Nitride with Greatly Extended Visible-Light Response and Efficient
   Photocatalytic ActivityY
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Constructing bulk defects and doping are feasible ways to essentially narrow the band gap and improve the light absorption of photocatalysts. Herein, inspired by bread foaming, the foaming agent azoformamide or azodicarbonamide (AC) was introduced during the thermal polymerization of urea. In the polymerization process, a large number of bubbles produced by AC decomposition seriously interfered with the polymerization of urea, resulting in the breaking of the hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interaction in carbon nitride, distortion of its structure, and partial oxidation, thus forming a series of porous carbon nitrides U/AC(x) (x is the ratio of AC to urea; where x = 0.25, 0.5, and 1) with bulk N defects and O doping. Its band gap was reduced to 1.91 eV and the absorption band edge was greatly extended to 650 nm. The optimal U/AC(0.5) exhibits the highest visible light photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of about 44.7 mu mol.h(-1) (10 mg catalysts) and shows superior photocatalytic performance for the oxidation of diphenylhydrazine to azobenzene, with conversion and selectivity of almost 100%, and is one of the most active defective carbon nitrides, especially under long-wavelength (lambda >= 550 nm) light irradiation. It paves the way for the design of highly efficient and wide-spectral-response photocatalysts.

TI Hydroxylase-like Biomimetic Nanozyme Synthesized via a
   Urea-Mediated MOF Pyrolytic Reconstruction Strategy for
   Non-"o-Phenol hydroxyl"-Dependent Dopamine Electrochemical
   Sensing
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Dopamine (DA), an essential neurotransmitter, is closely associated with various neurological disorders, whose real-time dynamic monitoring is significant for evaluating the physiological activities of neurons. Electrochemical sensing methods are commonly used to determine DA, but they mostly rely on the redox reaction of its o-phenolic hydroxyl group, which makes it difficult to distinguish it from substances with this group. Here, we design a biomimetic nanozyme inspired by the coordination structure of the copper-based active site of dopamine beta-hydroxylase, which was successfully synthesized via a urea-mediated MOF pyrolysis reconstruction strategy. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations revealed that the nanozyme with Cu-N-3 coordination could hydroxylate the carbon atom of the DA beta-site at a suitable potential and that the active sites of this Cu-N-3 structure have the lowest binding energy for the DA beta-site. With this property, the new oxidation peak achieves the specific detection of DA rather than the traditional electrochemical signal of o-phenol hydroxyl redox, which would effectively differentiate it from neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine and epinephrine. The sensor exhibited good monitoring capability in DA concentrations from 0.05 to 16.7 mu M, and its limit of detection was 0.03 mu M. Finally, the sensor enables the monitoring of DA released from living cells and can be used to quantitatively analyze the effect of polystyrene microplastics on the amount of DA released. The research provides a method for highly specific monitoring of DA and technical support for initial screening for neurocytotoxicity of pollutants.

TI General Method to Introduce π-Electrons into Oxygen-Doped Porous Carbon
   Nitride for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Toluene Oxidation
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB pi-Electrons have been successfully connected to an oxygen-doped porous carbon nitride by one-pot pyrolysis of the mixture of urea, ethanol, and 4-iodobenzaldehyde (IBD) in the atmosphere. The resulting COCN20 exhibits superior photocatalytic hydrogen production up to 6.88 mmol h(-1) g(cat)(-1) with a relatively high apparent quantum efficiency (20.6% at 325 nm) as well as toluene oxidation with an outstanding conversion rate of 3.75 mmol h(-1) g(cat)(-1) under 460 nm irradiation. Other pi-electrons from aromatic heterocycles could also be grafted to the network for the general synthesis, demonstrating higher hydrogen evolution rates (e.g., 9.32 mmol h(-1) g(cat)(-1) with the thiophene-pi-electrons coupling). The enhanced n -> pi* electron transition and activated midgap states are found to extend the light-responsive region and improve the capture of effective electrons, while the novel porous architecture encourages the efficient mass-transfer rate and improves light harvesting. This work showcases a straightforward and scalable approach to fabricate immensely proficient photocatalysts composed of porous carbon nitride. Furthermore, it opens up a novel pathway for the methodical development and production of sophisticated photocatalysts that harness the powerful synergistic effects achieved by simultaneously adjusting and refining the electronic, surface, and molecular structures.

TI Regulation on tribological performance of tungsten-doped DLC coatings by
   choline chloride-urea and-thiourea deep eutectic solvents
SO SURFACE TOPOGRAPHY-METROLOGY AND PROPERTIES
AB Solid-liquid composite lubrication system has attracted an increased interest for low friction and wear. Nevertheless, the effect of mechanical and surface properties of the solid materials, especially the mechanical and surface properties governed by doping elements, on the tribological performance solid-liquid composite lubrication system is still not well comprehended. Here, we reported the effect of W content on the mechanical and surface properties of W-DLC coatings as well as the tribological properties of W-DLC coatings under (choline chloride-urea and choline chloride-thiourea) deep eutectic solvents lubrication. Although the wear of W-DLC coatings under dry friction increases with W content, the wear under DESs is slight when coatings show excellent wettability to DESs or a DES-derived tribochemical film is formed. We demonstrate that the tribological behavior of W-DLC and DESs composite lubrication system is related to the mechanical properties of W-DLC coatings together with the contact angle and tribochemical interaction between DESs and W-DLC coatings.

TI Synergistic effects of Ir-Au/TiO2 catalysts in the total
   oxidation of propene: influence of the activation conditions
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Iridium was added to the Au/TiO2 system to try to enhance its catalytic activity in the reaction of propene oxidation, performed under conditions close to those used in the studies of decomposition of volatile organic compounds (1200 ppm propene and 9 vol% O-2 in He). Titania supported Ir-Au (Ir/Au = 1) was prepared by sequential deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) of Ir then Au. The effect of the activation conditions (hydrogen or air at 400 degrees C) was investigated. The study of the activation conditions of Ir-Au/TiO2 showed that activation under hydrogen at 400 degrees C generated a catalyst more active than the monometallic ones, while Ir-Au/TiO2 activated in air remained as poorly active as Au/TiO2. TEM characterization showed the formation of metallic particles of similar size (2-3 nm) in both monometallic Au/TiO2 and bimetallic Ir-Au/TiO2. Characterization especially by DRIFTS using CO as a probe molecule suggests the presence of Ir-Au interaction, IrO2-Au-0 interaction when the sample is calcined and Ir-0-Au-0 bimetallic particles when it is reduced. XPS and TPR characterization techniques showed that gold hinders to some extent the reoxidation of iridium in the reduced bimetallic Ir-Au/TiO2 catalyst. The enhanced catalytic activity of the reduced bimetallic Ir-Au/TiO2 catalyst is attributed to a surface Ir-0-Au-0 synergism.

   tubes for efficient electrocatalytic water oxidation
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The development of economical noble metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high catalytic activity and durability is crucial for the practical applications of many energy storage and conversion technologies. Here, we report a facile and economical synthesis of Co@CoNx/N-doped carbon tubes hybrid (Co@CoNx/NCT hybrid) via one-step pyrolysis of ZIF-67 at a low temperature of 650 degrees C with the introduction of urea, which functions as both nitrogen source and promoter of carbon tube growth. The resultant Co@CoNx/NCT hybrid exhibits bamboo-like structure with numerous active sites originated from abundant CoNx species, high nitrogen doping level and topological defects, rendering excellent catalytic activities towards OER in alkaline medium. As a result, the as-obtained Co@CoNx/NCT hybrid shows an overpotential of as low as 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1), which outperforms most noble metal-free electrocatalysts and even commercial IrO2 . Therefore, the Co@CoNx/NCT hybrid holds great promise for efficient electrocatalytic water oxidation applications. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Hierarchically Porous, Biphasic, and C-Doped TiO2 for Solar
   Photocatalytic Degradation of Dyes and Selective Oxidation of Benzyl
   Alcohol
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Macroporous TiO2 monoliths were synthesized by self-sustained combustion reactions of molded pellets made up of a mixture of TiCl4 as a precursor, urea as a fuel, ammonium nitrate as an oxidizer, and starch as a binder. The porous TiO2 monoliths were found to be a heterostructure of anatase and rutile phases, in addition to being doped with carbon. Variation in the amount of starch yielded porous monoliths of different anatase-rutile ratios (increasing rutile component from 0 to 40%) but comparable Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (similar to 30 m(2) g(-1)). The porous monoliths obtained, where the TiCl4/starch mass ratio was 2.17, exhibit exceptional photocatalytic activity in the degradation of dyes (methylene blue and methyl orange) and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under natural sunlight. The synergistic combination of high surface area, porous network, lowered band gap due to heterostructured anatase-rutile polymorphs, and the presence of doped carbon renders the macroporous TiO2 an efficient photocatalyst.

TI Vanadium-catalyzed Oxidative Conversion of Primary Aromatic Alcohols
   into Amides and Nitriles with Molecular Oxygen
SO CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL
AB Amides or nitriles are important building blocks because of the widespread occurrence in chemistry and biology. The development of green and efficient catalytic approaches to introduce nitrogen functionality is highly desired. Herein, a vanadium-based material V-N-C-700 was prepared via a simple and convenient method, and employed for liquid-phase catalytic ammoxidation of alcohols with molecular oxygen. By using V-N-C-700/2-picolinic acid, primary aromatic alcohols was smoothly converted into the amides and nitriles in the presence of urea. The corresponding aldehydes are the key intermediates, and 2-picolinic acid could significantly enhance oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes. The amides were formed simultaneously along with nitriles, rather than only from nitriles via successive hydration. This work further expands non-noble metal catalysts for the preparation of amides and nitriles.

TI In situ growth of self-composed cerium iron oxide hierarchal structures
   as a novel anode electrocatalyst for direct methanol fuel cells
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Preparation of hierarchal structures of various dimensions in a single in-situ step is extremely challenging. However, they have gained huge attention for energy storage to electrocatalysis. Here, self-composed cerium iron oxide hierarchal structures are prepared using a novel in-situ process using urea as a ligand. The formed hierarchal structures are made of sheets, rods, and spherical particles. The deposition of the formed spherical particles on the surface of sheets and rods is observed. The prepared cerium iron oxide hierarchal structures are used as a catalyst for the electrooxidation of methanol. As an electrocatalyst, hierarchal structures showed a high specific current density of similar to 274 mA cm(-2). The observed onset potential for the cerium iron oxide is similar to 0.44 V. The retention of similar to 93.5% of the initial current density after 5000 consecutive seconds is observed. The iron present in cerium iron oxide hierarchal structures increases oxygen vacancies responsible for the observed superior methanol oxidation reaction activity. Results confirmed that hierarchal cerium iron oxide structures showed higher electrocatalytic activity than pristine cerium oxide and iron oxide materials.

TI Enhancing ROS generation and suppressing toxic intermediate production
   in photocatalytic NO oxidation on O/Ba co-functionalized amorphous
   carbon nitride
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB The generation of toxic intermediates during the photocatalytic reaction can result in the accumulation of secondary pollutants and lead to decreased performance. Here, we first designed an O/Ba co-functionalized amorphous carbon nitride (labeled as O-ACN-Ba) by conducting targeted density functional theory calculations for short-range and directional charge transfer in electronic transportation channels. Also, the O-ACN-Ba is synthesized via a one-step in situ co-pyrolysis of urea and BaCO3. The unique electronic structure O-ACN-Ba enables highly enhanced photocatalytic NO removal rate and suppresses the generation of toxic intermediate (NO2). The O and Ba are co-functionalized as a surface electronic trapping adjuster and an interlayer electronic trapping mediator to induce the convergence and localization of intralayer-delocalized electrons. Such internal electronic structure can facilitate the adsorption and activation of NO and O-2, elongate the lifetime of photo generated carriers, and expedite the spatial charge separation to boost significantly the generation of reactive oxygen species, thus suppressing toxic NO2 generation. In addition, the photocatalytic NO conversion pathway on O-ACN-Ba is characterized, and an important reaction intermediate-nitrosyl species Ba-NO delta((+)) is discovered and found to promote the selective conversion of NO to final products (nitrites or nitrates). This work proposes a novel strategy to advance the application of photocatalytic technology for efficient and safe air purification.

TI General synthesis of carbon and oxygen dual-doped graphitic carbon
   nitride via copolymerization for non-photochemical oxidation of organic
   pollutant
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Earth-abundant, environmental-benign and durable catalysts are of paramount importance for remediation of organic pollutants, and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a promising nonmetallic material for this application. However, the catalytic oxidation on g-C3N4 suffers from low efficiency because of its chemical inertness if not irradiated with light. Herein, we develop a facile copolymerization strategy for the synthesis of carbon and oxygen dual-doped g-C3N4 using urea as g-C3N4 precursor and ascorbic acid (AA) as carbon and oxygen sources, which induces electronic structure reconfiguration. By replacing AA with other organic precursors, a series of C and O dual-doped g-C3N4 are successfully prepared, demonstrating the generally of the developed methodology. As a demonstration, the C and O dual-doped g-C3N4 using AA as the organic precursor (CN-AA(0.3)) exhibits pronouncedly enhanced catalytic activity in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for organic pollutant degradation without light irradiation compared with pristine g-C3N4 and single oxygen-doped g-C3N4. Experimental and theoretical results revealed the electron-poor C atoms and electron-rich O atoms as active sites for PMS activation in terms of simultaneous PMS oxidation and reduction. This work offers a universal approach to synthesize nonmetal dual-doped g-C3N4 with reconfigured electronic structure, stimulating the development of g-C3N4-based materials for diverse environmental applications.

TI Nivolumab anticancer monoclonal antibody native and denatured direct
   electrochemistry at a glassy carbon electrode
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Nivolumab (NIVO) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody used in the immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer. The electrochemical oxidation of native NIVO, in solution and adsorbed on a glassy carbon electrode, using differential pulse voltammetry, showed two pH-dependent oxidation peaks, the first one corresponding to the cysteine amino acid residues, and the second one corresponding to the tyrosine and tryptophan amino acid residues. The interfacial behaviour and adsorption of native and denatured NIVO thick multilayer film adsorbed on glassy carbon electrode surface was probed by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The denaturation of a NIVO thick multilayel film adsorbed on a glassy carbon electrode surface, with chemical agents: denaturing agents urea and sodium dodecyl sulphate, and reductants tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and dithiothreitol, was investigated electrochemically. The unfolded denatured adsorbed NIVO morphological structure, enhanced the exposure of more electroactive amino acid residues to the electrode surface, and a new additional peak, due to the tryptophan, methionine, and histidine amino acid residues oxidation, was found.

TI In situ FT-IR investigation on the reaction mechanism of visible light
   photocatalytic NO oxidation with defective g-C3N4
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB The g-C3N4 with different structures was prepared by heat treatment using urea (CN-U) and thiourea (CN-T) as precursors under the same conditions. The microstructure and optical properties of the photocatalyst were analyzed with advanced tools. The results showed that the CN-U has a porous structure, a high specific surface area and a wide band gap in comparison with CN-T. The in situ FT-IR technique was used to monitor the adsorption and reaction process of visible photocatalytic NO oxidation on g-C3N4. The corresponding reaction mechanism was proposed based on the results of reaction intermediate observation and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) radical scavenging. It was revealed that (1) the presence of defective sites favored the adsorption of gas molecules and electronically compensated it leading to promoted formation of the final products; (2) the high separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs enhanced the production of radicals during the photocatalytic reaction; (3) the hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) are not selective for the decomposition of pollutants, which are favorable to the complete oxidation of the reaction intermediates. The above three aspects are the main reasons for the CN-U possessing the efficient visible light photocatalytic activity. The present work could provide new insights and methods for understanding the mechanism of photocatalysis. (C) 2017 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

TI Designed synthesis of thin CeO2 nanowires-supported Pt
   electrocatalysts with pore-interconnected structure and its high
   catalytic activity for methanol oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A strong local coordination structure of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) over ultra-thin CeO2 nanowires (NWS) has been synthesized to investigate the role of CeO2 NWS on the enhancement of methanol oxidation activity. The Pt/CeO2 NWS catalyst was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical tests. The results showed that Pt/CeO2 NWS exhibited 1.23 times higher activity and 1.22 times longer-time durability over a commercial 20 wt% Pt/XC-72 catalyst. To further enhance the activity of Pt/CeO2 NWS catalyst and mass transfer ability, the in situ carbonization of urea had been adopted to provide N-doped carbon doping layer and porous interconnection between CeO2 (NWS) network, and the resulted catalyst showed 1.38 times greater activity than undoped Pt/CeO2 NWS. It was ascribed to the pyridine-like and pyrrole-like nitrogen in N-doped carbon layers, which greatly increased the electrical conductivity of CeO2 NWS and decreased the loss of electron transfer energy, as well as the strong interaction between Pt NPs and CeO2 NWS with their anisotropy and unique pore-interconnected structure.

TI Crucial Roles of Systemic and Tissue Lipid Peroxidation Levels and
   Anti-Oxidant Defences Following Contrast Agent Application
SO IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Background: One of the most important side effects of contrast pharmaceutical agents, which are used very common in routine radiology practice, is contrast induced nephropathy. Even ischemia, oxidative stress and osmolality related cytotoxic effects are considered, the molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology have not been identified completely yet.
   Objectives: The aim of the current study was to reveal the role of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymatic defence mechanisms in the aetiopathogenesis of contrast-induced nephropathy. We also studied possible alleviating effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, to obtain extra information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology.
   Materials and Methods: This is an clinical-experimental study, This study was conducted of Istanbul/Turkey between September 15, 2012 and April 15, 2013. Three groups of male rats were randomly set up as a control group (C), a 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal NAC + 7 mL/kg contrast agent group (N + CIN) and a 7 mL/kg intraperitoneal contrast agent group (CIN). They were placed in individual metabolic cages 48 hours after agent administration to obtain 24-hour urine samples. Renal function tests (albumin, urea, creatinine, total protein) were conducted, oxidative stress parameters (Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase activity - Cu, Zn-SOD; advanced oxidation protein products - AOPP; protein carbonyls - PCO; total thiol groups - T-SH; and lipid hydroperoxides - LHP) were measured and tissues were analysed histopathologically.
   Results: Compared with the control group, groups CIN and N + CIN had significantly higher urea and LHP levels (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively) and significantly lower Cu, Zn-SOD activity and creatinine clearance (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in PCO or AOPP levels despite differences in descriptive statistics.
   Conclusions: Contrast-agent-induced nephropathic changes are more closely related to the magnitude of lipid peroxidation than protein oxidation.

TI Benzothiazolyl Ureas are Low Micromolar and Uncompetitive Inhibitors of
   17β-HSD10 with Implications to Alzheimer's Disease Treatment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Human 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 is a multifunctional protein involved in many enzymatic and structural processes within mitochondria. This enzyme was suggested to be involved in several neurological diseases, e.g., mental retardation, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease, in which it was shown to interact with the amyloid-beta peptide. We prepared approximately 60 new compounds based on a benzothiazolyl scaffold and evaluated their inhibitory ability and mechanism of action. The most potent inhibitors contained 3-chloro and 4-hydroxy substitution on the phenyl ring moiety, a small substituent at position 6 on the benzothiazole moiety, and the two moieties were connected via a urea linker (4at, 4bb, and 4bg). These compounds exhibited IC50 values of 1-2 mu M and showed an uncompetitive mechanism of action with respect to the substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA. These uncompetitive benzothiazolyl inhibitors of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 are promising compounds for potential drugs for neurodegenerative diseases that warrant further research and development.

TI Recent progress in energy-saving electrocatalytic hydrogen production
   via regulating the anodic oxidation reaction
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Hydrogen energy with its advantages of high calorific value, renewable nature, and zero carbon emissions is considered an ideal candidate for clean energy in the future. The electrochemical decomposition of water, powered by renewable and clean energy sources, presents a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to hydrogen production. However, the traditional electrochemical overall water-splitting reaction (OWSR) is limited by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with sluggish kinetics. Although important advances have been made in efficient OER catalysts, the theoretical thermodynamic difficulty predetermines the inevitable large potential (1.23 V vs. RHE for the OER) and high energy consumption for the conventional water electrolysis to obtain H-2. Besides, the generation of reactive oxygen species at high oxidation potentials can lead to equipment degradation and increase maintenance costs. Therefore, to address these challenges, thermodynamically favorable anodic oxidation reactions with lower oxidation potentials than the OER are used to couple with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to construct new coupling hydrogen production systems. Meanwhile, a series of robust catalysts applied in these new coupled systems are exploited to improve the energy conversion efficiency of hydrogen production. Besides, the electrochemical neutralization energy (ENE) of the asymmetric electrolytes with a pH gradient can further promote the decrease in application voltage and energy consumption for hydrogen production. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the advancements in electrochemical hydrogen production strategies with low energy consumption, including (1) the traditional electrochemical overall water splitting reaction (OWSR, HER-OER); (2) the small molecule sacrificial agent oxidation reaction (SAOR) and (3) the electrochemical oxidation synthesis reaction (EOSR) coupling with the HER (HER-SAOR, HER-EOSR), respectively; (4) regulating the pH gradient of the cathodic and anodic electrolytes. The operating principle, advantages, and the latest progress of these hydrogen production systems are analyzed in detail. In particular, the recent progress in the catalytic materials applied to these coupled systems and the corresponding catalytic mechanism are further discussed. Furthermore, we also provide a perspective on the potential challenges and future directions to foster advancements in electrocatalytic green sustainable hydrogen production.

TI Removal of the antimicrobial activity from fortified effluents with
   fluoroquinolones by photocatalytic processes: a comparative study of
   differently synthesized TiO2-N
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This study presents a comparison of three methods for TiO2-N synthesis that were applied in the photocatalytic oxidation of the fluoroquinolones (FQs) ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin in aqueous solution. The TiO2-N bandgap is small enough to allow the use of solar energy in the photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) reactions. The TiO(2)doped by a sol-gel method with titanium butoxide (TiO2-N-BUT) and titanium isopropoxide (TiO2-N-PROP) as the precursor were effective as the TiO2(P25) impregnation with urea (TiO2-N-P25) to degrade the FQs. The FQ degradation was higher by 74, 65, and 91%, respectively for TiO2-N-BUT, TiO2-N-PROP, and TiO2-N (load 50 mg L-1, 20 min of reaction under 28 W UV-A(Solar)). The TiO2-P25 with urea showed the best performance in FQ degradation. The reaction intermediates might present modifications in their acceptor groups by PCO and, because of that the antimicrobial activity dropped as the reaction time increased. Reactions with TiO2-N-P25 (100 mg L-1) and TiO2-N-BUT (100 mg L-1) achieved >= 80% of antimicrobial activity removal from the mixed FQ solution (C-ciprofloxacin= 100 mu g L-1; C-ofloxacin= 100 mu g L-1; C-lomefloxacin= 100 mu g L-1) after 40 min of reaction, for both forEscherichia coliandBacillus subtilis.

SO MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB To test if different niches for potential nitrifiers exist in estuarine systems, we assessed by pyrosequencing the diversity of archaeal gene transcript markers for taxonomy (16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)) during an entire year along a salinity gradient in surface waters of the Charente estuary (Atlantic coast, France). We further investigated the potential for estuarine prokaryotes to oxidize ammonia and hydrolyze urea by quantifying thaumarchaeal amoA and ureC and bacterial amoA transcripts. Our results showed a succession of different nitrifiers from river to sea with bacterial amoA transcripts dominating in the freshwater station while archaeal transcripts were predominant in the marine station. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that Thaumarchaeota marine group I (MGI) were the most abundant overall but other archaeal groups like Methanosaeta were also potentially active in winter (December-March) and Euryarchaeota marine group II (MGII) were dominant in seawater in summer (April-August). Each station also contained different Thaumarchaeota MGI phylogenetic clusters, and the clusters' microdiversity was associated to specific environmental conditions suggesting the presence of ecotypes adapted to distinct ecological niches. The amoA and ureC transcript dynamics further indicated that some of the Thaumarchaeota MGI subclusters were involved in ammonia oxidation through the hydrolysis of urea. Our findings show that ammonia-oxidizing Archaea and Bacteria were adapted to contrasted conditions and that the Thaumarchaeota MGI diversity probably corresponds to distinct metabolisms or life strategies.

TI Synthesis and Characterization of NiCoPt/CNFs Nanoparticles as an
   Effective Electrocatalyst for Energy Applications
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this work, three nanoparticle samples, Ni4Co2Pt/CNFs, Ni5CoPt/CNFs and Ni6Pt/CNFs, were designed according to the molar ratio during loading on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) using electrospinning and carbonization at 900 ffi C for 7 h in an argon atmosphere. The metal loading and carbon ratio were fixed at 20 and 80 wt%, respectively. Various analysis tools were used to investigate the chemical composition, structural, morphological, and electrochemical (EC) properties. For samples with varying Co%, the carbonization process reduces the fiber diameter of the obtained electrospun nanofibers from 200-580 nm to 150-200 nm. The EDX mapping revealed that nickel, platinum, and cobalt were evenly and uniformly incorporated into the carbonized PVANFs. The prepared Ni-CoPt/CNFs have a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure with slightly increased crystallite size as the Co% decreased. The electrocatalytic properties of the samples were investigated for ethanol, methanol and urea electrooxidation. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance measurements, the catalytic performance and electrode stability were investigated as a function of electrolyte concentration, scan rate, and reaction time. When Co is added to Ni, the activation energy required for the electrooxidation reaction decreases and the electrode stability increases. In 1.5 M methanol, the Ni5CoPt/CNFs electrode showed the lowest onset potential and the highest current density (30.6 A/g). This current density is reduced to 28.2 and 21.2 A/g for 1.5 M ethanol and 0.33 M urea, respectively. The electrooxidation of ethanol, methanol, and urea using our electrocatalysts is a combination of kinetic/diffusion control limiting reactions. This research provided a unique approach to developing an efficient Ni-Co-Pt-based electrooxidation catalyst for ethanol, methanol and urea.

TI Preferential oxidation of CO in excess of H2 on
   Pt/CeO2-Nb2O5 catalysts
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB A series of CeO2-Nb2O5 mixed oxides with different Nb content, as well as the pure oxides, have been synthesized by co-precipitation with excess urea. These materials have been used as supports for platinum catalysts, with [Pt(NH3)(4)](NO3)(2) as precursor. Both supports and catalysts have been characterized by several techniques: N2 physisorption at 77K, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed reduction and temperature-programmed desorption (CO and H-2), and their catalytic behaviour has been determined in the PROX reaction, both with an ideal gas mixture (CO, O-2 and H-2) and in simulated reformate gas containing CO2 and H2O. Raman spectroscopy analysis has shown the likely substitution of some Ce4+ cations by Nb5+ to some extent in supports with low niobium contents. Moreover, the presence of Nb in the supports hinders their ability to adsorb CO and to oxidize it to CO2. However, an improvement of the catalytic activity for CO oxidation is obtained by adding Nb to the support, although the Pt/Nb2O5 catalyst shows very low activity. The best results are found with the Pt/0.7CeO(2)-0.3Nb(2)O(5) catalyst, which shows a high CO conversion (85%) and a high yield (around 0.6) after a reduction treatment at 523 K. The effect of the presence of CO2 and H2O in the feed has also been determined. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The protein oxidation of soybean meal induced by heating decreases its
   protein digestion in vitro and impairs growth performance and
   digestive function in broilers
SO BRITISH POULTRY SCIENCE
AB 1. The soybean meal (SBM) was heated at 100 degrees C for 1, 2, 4 and 8h, respectively, and their resultant oxidative status was evaluated.2. A total of 400 one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly divided into 5 treatments with 8 replicates of 10 birds each, and fed with diets containing non-heated SBM (NHSBM) or 1 of 4heated SBMs (HSBMs, SBMs heated at 100 degrees C for 1, 2, 4 and 8h, respectively) for 42d.3. The contents of carbonyl in the SBMs were both linearly and quadratically increased, whereas the nitrogen solubility index, and in vitro digestibility of crude protein (CP) and dry matter (DM) in the SBMs were both linearly and quadratically decreased as heating time increased (P<0.05). The concentrations of sulfhydryl and total sulfhydryl in the SBMs were linearly decreased as heating time increased (P<0.05).4. The average daily gain was linearly decreased while the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was linearly increased in broilers as heating time of dietary HSBMs increased during both d 22-42 and d 1-42 of study (P<0.05), though FCR of broilers during d 22-42 study were unaffected when the heating time of dietary HSBMs was 1h (P>0.05). The serum glucose concentration and the activity of trypsin at d 42, and the apparent total digestibility of CP and DM were all linearly reduced in broilers when heating time of dietary HSBMs increased (P<0.05). However, 1h HSBM has a numerical higher CP and DM digestibility than NHSBM. The serum urea nitrogen contents were both linearly and quadratically increased at both d 21 and 42 (P<0.05), and relative pancreas weight was linearly increased at d 42 in broilers as heating time of dietary HSBMs increased (P<0.05).

TI Effect of flaxseed oil on muscle protein loss and carbohydrate oxidation
   impairment in a pig model after lipopolysaccharide challenge
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB Flaxseed oil is rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is the metabolic precursor of EPA and DHA. The present study investigated the effect of flaxseed oil supplementation on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced muscle atrophy and carbohydrate oxidation impairment in a piglet model. Twenty-four weaned pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial experiment including dietary treatment (5 % maize oil v. 5 % flaxseed oil) and LPS challenge (saline v. LPS). On day 21 of treatment, the pigs were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mu g/kg body weight LPS or sterile saline. At 4 h after injection, blood, gastrocnemius muscle and longissimus dorsi muscle were collected. Flaxseed oil supplementation increased ALA, EPA, total n-3 PUFA contents, protein:DNA ratio and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex quantity in muscles (P < 0 center dot 05). In addition, flaxseed oil reduced mRNA expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain protein (NOD) 2 and their downstream signalling molecules in muscles and decreased plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8, and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 (P < 0 center dot 05). Moreover, flaxseed oil inclusion increased the ratios of phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) 1:total Akt1 and phosphorylated Forkhead box O (FOXO) 1:total FOXO1 and reduced mRNA expression of FOXO1, muscle RING finger (MuRF) 1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 in muscles (P < 0 center dot 05). These results suggest that flaxseed oil might have a positive effect on alleviating muscle protein loss and carbohydrates oxidation impairment induced by LPS challenge through regulation of the TLR4/NOD and Akt/FOXO signalling pathways.

TI Fabrication of a composite of platinum, N-g-C3N4
   and Ketjen Black for photo-electrochemical methanol oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Recently N-doped graphitic carbon-incorporated g-C3N4 (denoted as N-g-C3N4) exhibits better electroconductivity and photo-catalytic property compared with pure g-C3N4 as a support material for Pt nanoparticles (NPs). A composite catalyst consisting of Pt nanoparticles and N-g-C3N4-modified KB was designed and fabricated. Pt nanoparticles were prepared through a solution plasma process; N-g-C3N4 was prepared by direct heating the mixture of urea and citric acid monohydrate and subsequently treated by hydrothermal method. Their chemical composition, particle size and microstructure were investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Compared with the Pt/KB catalyst, ternary Pt/N-g-C3N4/KB nanocomposites exhibit excellent electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation owning to the significant synergistic effects of individual components. Once light irradiation was supplied, Pt/N-g-C3N4/KB catalyst exhibits exceptional forward peak current densities as high as 2800 mA mg (Pt) (-1) . And Pt/N-g-C3N4/KB catalyst also shows better CO tolerance than Pt/KB. Such a Pt/N-g-C3N4/KB composite catalyst may bring new design ideas for photo-assisted direct methanol fuel cell in the future.

AB A series of nanosized ceria-zirconia mixed oxides were prepared by an original procedure using template-assisted precipitation with urea followed by a hydrothermal treatment step at two different temperatures (373 K or 413 K). The obtained materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, UV-Vis spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with hydrogen and their potential application in catalysis was tested in ethyl acetate combustion as a model reaction for total oxidation of volatile organic compounds. The results show that mixed oxide samples prepared using higher hydrothermal treatment temperature (413 K instead of 373 K) possess more finely dispersed tetragonal zirconia particles and significantly higher total pore volumes due to larger pore sizes, while the BET specific surface areas remains similar. Thus improved textural characteristics favor the higher catalytic activity found with the mixed ceria-zirconia samples synthesized by using the higher hydrothermal treatment temperature.

TI NOx and N2O emissions over a Urea-SCR system containing both
   V2O5-WO3/TiO2 and Cu-zeolite
   catalysts in a diesel engine
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB To develop a novel selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system, V2O5-WO3/TiO2 and Cu-zeolite catalysts were combined within one canister with the former upstream and the latter downstream. The nitrogen oxides (NOx) and N2O emissions for the combined catalyst were investigated under operating conditions of engine loads and speeds in a 3.4 L diesel engine. The results from the combined catalyst were compared with those from the vanadium-based and Cu-zeolite catalysts alone. The NO conversion efficiencies for all the catalysts were higher than approximately 80% at temperatures ranging from 200 to 410 degrees C, which corresponds to the NO2 excess range. In other words, the NO2/NOx ratio was higher than 50% for the temperature range between 200 and 410 degrees C, although the maximum NO2/NOx ratio was obtained at 270 degrees C. Beyond 410 degrees C, the efficiency of the Cu-zeolite catalyst remained high; however, the vanadium-based catalyst started to deteriorate at 410 degrees C. The deterioration of the combined catalyst was not much larger than that of the vanadium-based catalyst owing to the superior capability of the Cu-zeolite catalyst. For the NO2 conversion efficiency, the combined catalyst mostly followed the Cu-zeolite catalyst. The vanadium-based catalyst exhibited an efficiency drop at approximately 270 degrees C, which is the temperature of the highest NO2/NOx ratio; however, this efficiency drop was avoided in the combined catalyst. For N2O produced over the catalysts, the Cu-zeolite catalyst produced the most N2O, while the vanadium-based catalyst produced the least. Because the amount of N2O produced behind the SCR was at most five times that in front of the SCR, efforts to inhibit N2O production from SCR are required when considering the global warming potential of N2O. The combined catalyst produced intermediate levels of N2O. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI NiCoP coated on NiCo2S4 nanoarrays as electrode
   materials for hydrogen evolution reaction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB It is very important to exploit robust electrocatalysts for the urea splitting in an alkaline medium. Hence, the NiCo2S4@NiCoP nanoarrays on Ni foam (NiCo2S4@NiCoP/NF) was successfully synthesized for the first time and used as an efficient and stable difunctional electrocatalyst for the overall urea splitting. As one of the most promising bifunctional electrocatalysts reported, NiCo2S4@NiCoP only needs 108 mV to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, such NiCo2S4@NiCoP//NiCo2S4@NiCoP electrodes couple display superior urea splitting performance with the requirement of a cell voltage of 1.53 V to drive a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the NiCo2S4@NiCoP material presents high long-term electrocatalytic stability keeping its performance at 11 mA cm(-2) for 12 h. The experimental results demonstrate that the sluggish Volmer step has been improved by incorporating the NiCoP to the NiCo2S4. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Molten salt synthesis of a highly crystalline graphitic carbon nitride
   homojunction from a deep eutectic solvent for selective photocatalytic
   oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The construction of homojunctions in graphitic carbon nitride is regarded as an efficient approach to improve the charge separation and photocatalytic activity. However, the enhanced activity is still far from satisfactory due to the low crystalline bulk structure. Herein, a highly crystalline graphitic carbon nitride homojunction is synthesized by calcination of a mixture of NH4SCN and urea, which forms a deep eutectic solvent using NaCl/KCl molten salts as the preparation medium. The homogeneity of the liquid precursor ensures an intimate homojunction interface, facilitating the charge separation, and the highly crystalline bulk structure builds a highway for rapidly transferring charge to the surface. Consequently, the bulk charge recombination is suppressed, and the spatial separation and transfer efficiency of charges are significantly improved. Compared to low crystalline homojunctions, this highly crystalline homojunction showed 15 times higher activity for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. This work provides a simple strategy to construct a highly crystalline graphitic carbon nitride homojunction for solar energy conversion.

TI Effects and functional mechanism of Tripterygium Wilfordii polyglycoside
   with catalpol on diabetic nephropathy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common and severe complication of diabetes. Tripterygium Wilfordii has dual roles in immune suppression and anti-inflammation, whilst catalpol can resist inflammation and oxidation. The effect of Tripterygium Wilfordii combined with catalpol in treating DN, has not been reported. Wistar rats were treated with Tripterygium Wilfordii polyglycoside and or catalpol after DN model was established. Serum levels of creatine (Scr), urea nitrogen (BUN), urea albumin (UAlb), lactate hydrogenase (LDH) and superoxide peroxidase (SOD) were measured at 4 weeks after treatment. Real-time PCR was employed for detecting the mRNA level of transformation growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, whilst caspase 3 activity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta were measured by ELISA. DN rats had elevated levels of Scr, BUN and UAlb, plus enhanced expression of TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Caspase 3 and LDH activity were also increased, with lower SOD level (p<0.05 compared with control group). Either Tripterygium Wilfordii polyglycoside or catalpol treatment significantly decreased the levels of Scr, BUN or UAlb, suppressed Caspase 3 activity, decreased expression of TGF-beta 1, TNF-a and IL-1 beta expression, suppressed LDH activity whilst increased SOD level (p<0.05 compared with DN model rats). Combined treatment group had better improvements than single usage (p<0.01). In conclusion, both Tripterygium Wilfordii polyglycoside and catalpol can regulate the balance between oxidation and anti-oxidation, suppress apoptosis and inflammation, with combined therapy having better efficiency.

TI Redox remodeling of central metabolism as a driving force for cellular
   protection, proliferation, differentiation, and dysfunction
SO FREE RADICAL RESEARCH
AB The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is elevated via metabolic hyperactivation in response to a variety of stimuli such as growth factors and inflammation. Tolerable amounts of ROS moderately inactivate enzymes via oxidative modification, which can be reversed back to the native form in a redox-dependent manner. The excessive production of ROS, however, causes cell dysfunction and death. Redox-reactive enzymes are present in primary metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and these act as floodgates for carbon flux. Oxidation of a specific form of cysteine inhibits glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is reversible, and causes an accumulation of upstream intermediary compounds that increases the flux of glucose-6-phosphate to the pentose phosphate pathway. These reactions increase the NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate that are available for reductive reactions and nucleotide synthesis, respectively. On the other hand, oxidative inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase increases citrate, which is then recruited to synthesize fatty acids in the cytoplasm. Decreases in the use of carbohydrate for ATP production can be compensated via amino acid catabolism, and this metabolic change makes nitrogen available for nucleic acid synthesis. Coupling of the urea cycle also converts nitrogen to urea and polyamine, the latter of which supports cell growth. This metabolic remodeling stimulates the proliferation of tumor cells and fibrosis in oxidatively damaged tissues. Oxidative modification of these enzymes is generally reversible in the early stages of oxidizing reactions, which suggests that early treatment with appropriate antioxidants promotes the maintenance of natural metabolism.

TI Exploring anodic oxidation reactions in hybrid water electrolysis:
   special emphasis on substrate choice
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Hybrid water electrolysis (HWE) stands out as a promising avenue for simultaneously producing high-value-added chemicals and clean H2 fuel. In HWE, instead of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) typical in electrochemical water splitting, the anodic oxidation reaction (AOR) takes place, leading to the conversion of organic/inorganic compounds at the anode into valuable chemicals, while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) generates H2 at the cathode. The recent literature has seen a surge in papers exploring various AORs utilizing organic and inorganic substrates to supplant the OER, yielding both high-value chemicals and H2. These studies highlight catalyst properties, conversion rates, chemical production, and H2 generation. Additionally, numerous reviews delve into the fundamentals, catalytic design, progress, and applications of catalysts in hybrid water electrolysis. However, a gap remains in identifying the most suitable organic/inorganic substrates for the AOR to replace the OER, considering factors such as potential enhancement, maximum current density achieved, substrate conversion, selectivity, interference from the OER, improved H2 production, energy efficiency, industrial scalability, and high-value chemical formation. This review aims to address this gap by systematically discussing the fundamentals of hybrid water electrolysis and key parameters of the AOR, crucial for replacing the OER. It examines suitable AORs in terms of value-added chemical production, conversion rates, selectivity, H2 generation, potential improvement, and industrial applicability through pioneering examples. Furthermore, it comprehensively explores the merits and drawbacks of hybrid water electrolysis, along with associated challenges and prospects in this domain.
   Anodic oxidation reactions have been assessed focusing on essential parameters for the substrate choice.

TI Fast and efficient oxidation of formaldehyde in wastewater via the Solar
   Thermal Electrochemical Process tuned by thermo-electrochemistry
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper reports the adaptation of the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) for the treatment of formaldehyde in wastewater. The combination of thermochemistry and electrochemistry makes the STEP-formaldehyde treatment highly efficient with rapid kinetics. Indoor experimental results showed that the working potential is decreased and the oxidation rate is increased by raising the temperature of the reactor. Outdoor pilot tests demonstrated that the STEP-formaldehyde oxidation system can work smartly and efficiently without input of energy other than sunlight and without human intervention. The mechanism and kinetics were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the in-time sampling and monitoring method. A robotic system is proposed for rapid treatment of formaldehyde using only solar energy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes catalyzed by
   dioxomolybdenum Schiff base complex: synthesis, spectral

   studies
SO TRANSITION METAL CHEMISTRY
AB A novel dioxomolybdenum Schiff base complex, MoO2L center dot DMF, was synthesized by treating MoO2(acac)(2) with an ONO donor Schiff base ligand (H2L) derived by the condensation of 4-aminobenzohydrazide and 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde. The synthesized ligand and complex were characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic techniques. Single-crystal X-ray analysis was also accomplished to ensure the molecular structure of the complex. The geometry around the central metal atom in MoO2L center dot DMF was distorted octahedral as revealed by the data collected from diffraction studies. Theoretical calculations of the synthesized compounds were carried out by DFT at B3LYP/Def2-TZVP level of theory, which showed a good correlation with the experimental findings. Moreover, the homogeneous catalytic efficiency of the complex was investigated by the process of selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols using urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in acetonitrile under reflux conditions.

TI Urea-assisted one-step fabrication of a novel nitrogen-doped carbon
   fiber aerogel from cotton as metal-free catalyst in peroxymonosulfate
   activation for efficient degradation of carbamazepine
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Nitrogen-doped carbon as metal-free catalysts exhibited exceptionally catalytic activities in environmental remediation fields. Herein, a novel nitrogen-doped carbon fiber aerogel (N-CFA), which was conveniently prepared using cotton and urea by a direct high temperature carbonization in one-step, was used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in water. Characterization results demonstrated that the key active sites (pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N) were formed in the process of nitrogen doping into the carbon fiber aerogel. More importantly, singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) instead of conventional (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- was suggested as the predominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) during N-CFA/PMS process based on the scavenger inhibition tests, and confirmed by molecular probe and liquid-phase electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments. It was speculated that nitrogen-containing functional groups played a key role in inducing the non-radical pathway. Moreover, CBZ degradation pathways mainly by O-1(2) were firstly proposed based on intermediates. The N-CFA/PMS system could achieve a CBZ degradation rate of 100% within 50 min, which was significantly higher than the catalytic effect of several carbon materials (ACF, GAC, and GO) and even higher than the catalytic effect of various metal-based catalysts including Co3O4, CuO, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3. It was also noted that the CBZ was removed with a satisfactory efficiency in different water matrices with inorganic anions (HCO3-, Cl-, H2PO4-, SO42-, and NO3-) and humic acid (HA). Thus, this study proposed a benign and highly efficient oxidation technology, which would exhibit wide potential for environmental restoration.

TI Novel soil remediation technology for simultaneous organic pollutant
   catalytic degradation and nitrogen supplementation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This study developed a novel remediation technology based on urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP) activated by a synthesized Fe-impregnated biochar (FB). The technology can simultaneously degrade sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and supply nitrogen nutrition in cropland soil. Experimental results showed that 97.56% of SMZ was removed in the FB-UHP system within 24 h, whereas 7.12% and 14.65% were removed in the individual application of FB and UHP. Chemical probe and scavenger test results demonstrated that SMZ degradation mainly occurred through oxidation of hydroxyl radicals generated from the activation of UHP by FB. The effects of FB pyrolysis temperature, initial pH, and reaction temperature were investigated. The combination of UHP and FB led to efficient SMZ degradation at a wide pH range of 2-10. Catalytic durability test results showed that FB exhibited good stability even after four uses. A soil column leaching experiment showed that the addition of FB-UHP reduced the SMZ leaching from the soil by 95.06%, increased the nitrogen content on surface soil by approximately 2.5 times, and decreased the nitrogen leaching by 97.57%. Early-stage seedling growth bioassay confirmed that FB-UHP significantly enhanced the SMZ degradation, increased the soil nitrogen content, and improved the lettuce plant growth. Therefore, application of FB-activated UHP is a promising technology for agricultural soil remediation.

TI In Situ Electrochemical Oxidation Synthesis of SyA-Cu/CuO/NF
   Heterostructure As Trifunctional Electrocatalyst for UOR, BOR, and HER
   at Industrial-Scale High Current Density
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB The construction of bifunctional or trifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent performance for highly effective overall water splitting is highly desirable and extremely challenging. Herein, Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) nanomaterials using syringic acid (SyA) as ligands are grown on nickel foam (NF) by a one-step solvothermal method, namely, the self-supported precursor (SyA-Cu/NF); further, a SyA-Cu/CuO/NF heterostructure is obtained by in situ electrochemical oxidation of these precursors, which is applied to the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction (BOR). The optimal SyA-Cu/CuO/NF heterostructure could reach 100 mA cm(-2) on only applying 1.47 V (vs RHE) with a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec-1 for UOR and 1.44 V with a Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1) for BOR. Furthermore, it also displays hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, showing a low overpotential of 92 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Above all, coupling UOR and BOR, it is used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the overall water splitting, which can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.47 and 1.45 V, respectively. Therefore, this SyA-Cu/CuO/NF heterostructure is a potential trifunctional electrocatalyst for UOR, BOR, and HER due to its unique interface interaction between SyA-Cu/CuO and the intermediates/electrolyte.

TI rGO functionalized (Ni,Fe)-OH for an efficient trifunctional catalyst in
   low-cost hydrogen generation via urea decomposition as a proxy
   anodic reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Green hydrogen derived from the water-electrolysis route is emerging as a game changer for achieving global carbon neutrality. Economically producing hydrogen through water electrolysis, however, requires the development of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts via scalable synthetic strategies. Herein, this work reports a simple and scalable immersion synthetic strategy to deposit reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets integrated with Ni-Fe-based hydroxide nanocatalysts on nickel foam (NF) at room temperature. As a result of synergetic interactions among the hydroxides, rGO and NF, enhanced catalytic sites with improved charge transport between the electrode and electrolyte were perceived, resulting in significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotentials of 270 and 320 mV at 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, in a 1.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. This performance is superior to those of the hydroxide-based electrode without incorporating rGO and the IrO2-benchmark electrode. Furthermore, when the conventional OER is substituted with urea decomposition (UOR) as a proxy anodic reaction, the electrolyzer achieves 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) at a lower potential by 150 and 120 mV, respectively than the OER counterpart without influencing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at the cathode. Notably, the rGO-incorporated electrode delivers a spectacularly high UOR current density of 1600 mA cm(-2) at 1.53 V vs. RHE, indicating the decomposition of urea at an outstandingly high rate.

TI One-Pot lonothermal Synthesized Carbon Nitride Heterojunction Nanorods
   for Simultaneous Photocatalytic Reduction and Oxidation Reactions:
   Synergistic Effect and Mechanism Insight
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Band structure and crystallinity engineering of polymeric semiconductors provides effective strategies for photocatalytic activity enhancement. Here, a facile one-step ionothermal method was developed to achieve the in situ growth of carbon nitride (CN) isotype heterojunctions (ms-CN-x) using KCl/LiCI eutectic salts as the high-temperature solvent and urea as the starting material, which are demonstrated to be efficient photocatalysts for removal of toxic heavy metal and organic pollutant in a single or coexisting system. The as-obtained ms-CN-x composite material appears as well-ordered nanorod structure with high crystallinity and consists of phases of both heptazine-based CN and triazine-based CN. With structural and morphological merits, the ms-CN-0.5 photocatalyst exhibits remarkable adsorption-photodegradation performance for high-level methylene blue (MB). Moreover, simultaneously enhanced photocatalytic reaction rate of Cr(VI) reduction and MB oxidation over ms-CN-0.5 are achieved and systematically investigated, which benefits from improved crystallinity, increased visible-light absorption, and promoted charge-carrier separation via one-dimensional heterojunction nanorods. On the basis of the reactive species study, a synergistic reduction-oxidation elimination mechanism is revealed, indicating that the photogenerated holes are primary active species for MB degradation, which are rapidly scavenged by MB in the Cr(VI)/MB coexisting solution, and the photoexcited electrons are responsible for the reduction of Cr(VI). Our work may provide new insight into the future design of efficient polymeric materials toward practical applications in the environment and energy chemistry.

TI Flexible visible-light-driven photoelectrochemical biosensor based on
   molecularly imprinted nanoparticle intercalation-modulated graphene
   fiber for ultrasensitive urea detection
SO CARBON
AB Flexible fiber-shaped microelectrode biosensors have aroused intensive attention due to the promising use for monitoring personal healthcare. However, challenges still exist in the pursuit of combination of high sensitivity and selectivity. Herein, a facile and effective strategy to solve these problems was proposed by developing a novel fiber-shaped photoelectrochemical urea biosensor (PUB) based on highly flexible graphene (G) fiber. The remarkable combined features of the resulting PUB with high surface roughness, good transmittance and superior molecular recognition could contribute to good adsorption capacity, convenient light absorption and selective detection, thus boosting a wide linear range from 0.01 to 1500 mM and a low detection limit of 1 nM. Meanwhile, rapid response, outstanding selectivity and perfect working performance during bending were available as expected. This research provides useful guidelines for designing and fabricating flexible microelectrode biosensors with high sensing performance toward future uses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Cu-Mn composite oxides: highly efficient and reusable acid-base
   catalysts for the carbonylation reaction of glycerol with urea
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A series of Cu-Mn composite oxides were prepared by co-precipitation. Interestingly, catalysts with varied Cu/Mn molar ratios showed different catalytic performances for glycerol carbonylation. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2 and NH3 and temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) technology. The results showed that the Cu1.4Mn1.6O4 crystal phase is the active component of the catalysts for the carbonylation of glycerol, this phase can effectively provide Mn4+ and lattice oxygen (O2-), and the existence of the Mn4+-O2- Lewis acid-base pair can promote the formation of glycerol carbonate. Various reaction parameters, such as reaction temperature, time, the molar ratio of glycerol to urea and the amount of catalysts, are studied. Under optimizing reaction conditions, the conversion of glycerol is 91.0% with 99.1% glycerol carbonate selectivity.

TI Characterization of Leather Wastes from Chrome Tanning and its Effect as
   Filler on the Rheometric Properties of Natural Rubber Compounds
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Chrome tanning generates large amounts of leather wastes (LW) which have become a considerable environmental issue. In this work, particulate LW with and without urea treatment were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under inert and oxidative atmospheres, and elemental analysis. Then treated LW (TLW) were incorporated in natural rubber compounds, seeking to find another way of disposal for this type of residue. The effect of TLW on rheometric properties of rubber composites during vulcanization was evaluated, including parameters related to leather particles dispersion in the matrix. It was found that TLW contained chromium and sulfur remaining from tanning, which could affect the properties of rubber compounds. During TGA analysis, oxidation of chromium into LW was increased as an effect of urea treatment. It was observed that TLW improved rubber processability during open two-roll mill mixing process. Rheometric characteristics allowed to identify a decreased TLW particle dispersion into the compound with the increase of its content in the composites. Stiffness of vulcanized composites and the kinetic of the vulcanization varied with TLW content, as an effect of the interaction of TLW with the rubber compound. Particulate leather wastes morphology could facilitate its mechanical interlocking with the polymeric matrix. The development of these type of composites will enable another profitable use for this type of waste.

TI N-doped low-rank coal based carbon catalysts for heterogeneous
   activation of peroxymonosulfate for ofloxacin oxidation via electron
   transfer and non-radical pathway
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Background: Advanced oxidation processes based on sulfate radicals were promising technologies for deep wastewater treatment. There was an urgent need of low-cost and green catalytic materials. Methods: In this study, N-doped low-rank coal based carbon catalysts (NLCs) were prepared under different urea and low-order coal ratios and pyrolysis temperatures, which showed excellent catalytic performance for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Significant findings: The NLCs had a high degree of graphitization and electrical conductivity, which leading to a high removal rates as 100% in 45 min. The N-doped structure lead to the formation of electron-rich regions, which favored the adsorption of PMS. Mechanistic studies revealed that the main reactive oxygen species in the NLC/PMS system was singlet oxygen (1O2), and that electron transfer pathways and surface-bound reactive complexes also played an important role in this system. The NLC/PMS system had a wide pH adaptation and good environment adaptation because of the electron transfer mechanism. It could remove 100% OFL in the pH range of 3-9. Therefore, the prepared N-doped coal based carbon catalytic materials had good prospects for application in advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment.

TI A prospective absorption system for marine NOx removal from
   simulated gas using Na2SO3/urea composite
   absorbents in bubble reactor
SO FUEL
AB The large amount of NOx emitted from ships causes great harm to the environment and to health. Due to the strict regulations on NOx emission, it is urgent to develop a marine NOx absorption technology with efficient NOx removal and less nitrate residue in scrubber water. This paper proposed a novel composite Na2SO3/(NH2)(2)CO absorption system that could efficiently absorb NOx from ships. The NOx absorption process was studied in combination with a bubble reactor. Na2SO3 could react with NOx to convert the N into nitrite and N-2, and (NH2)(2)CO could reduce the nitrate, nitrite, and NOx to N-2. The main key parameters such as Na2SO3 concentration, (NH2)(2)CO concentration, SO2 concentration, oxygen concentration, NOx oxidation degree, initial NOx concentration, initial pH, and temperature were investigated experimentally. The Na2SO3 concentration had great effects on the NOx absorption efficiency. The nitrate concentration was significantly affected by the absorbents concentration, the NOx oxidation degree, the temperature, and the O-2 concentration (0%-8%). Acid condition was not conducive to NOx absorption. A NOx absorption efficiency of 92.3%, a nitrate content of 13.1 mg/L, and the nitrite content of 21.3 mg/L were achieved under the optimal conditions in which, Na2SO3 was 0.25 mol/L, (NH2)(2)CO was 0.4 mol/L, SO2 was 700 ppm, NOx oxidation degree was 20%, initial NOx was 1000 ppm, and O-2 was 12%. The Na2SO3/(NH2)(2)CO absorption system satisfied the regulations on NOx removal efficiency and nitrate concentration of scrubber water and therefore showed excellent application prospects on ships.

TI Subsurface methane dynamics of a paddy field under long-term
   fertilization: <SUP>13</SUP>C-evidence from in-situ belowground labeling
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Rice paddies are a significant source and sink of methane (CH4). The field surface emission and laboratory turnover potential of CH4 have been extensively studied. However, there is a knowledge gap in underlying mechanisms linking in-situ belowground CH4 production and oxidation potentials affected by rice growth and fertilization. Here, we imemented an improved soil silicone tube approach and 13C-labeled CH4 to measure the in-situ production and oxidation of CH4 in the subsoil (20-30 cm) during rice growth under four long-term (7 years) fertilization treatments. Urea N (uN) fertilization decreased 3-folds CH4 production as compared to nonfertilized control (Control). In combination with uN, biochar apication (uN + Biochar) resulted in similarly low [CH4], but manure fertilization (uN + Manure) stimulated CH4 production which increased with rice growth and reached 0.6 mmol L-1 of soil tube at mature stage relative to uN. During the rice growth, 813C-CH4 values under all fertilizations progressively decreased as compared with the start of the experiment but remained in the range of acetoclastic methanogenesis (- 75 parts per thousand). Pronounced 813C-CO2 enrichment under uN + Manure indicated the increasing contribution of CO2-reduction pathway. The CH4 oxidation was highest (20.1 mu mol L-1) under uN + Manure at tillering stage, followed by uN (14.6 mu mol L-1) at seedling stage. The lowest oxidation potential was under uN + Biochar along with the weakest CH4 concentration dynamics. Water-locked conditions, low measured O2 concentration in silicon tubes, as well as the positive relationship between CH4 oxidation and NO3and DOC suggested a possibility of anaerobic oxidation of CH4 (AOM). In conclusion, the intensive rice growth during seedling and tillering stages controls subsoil CH4 concentrations via methanotrophic activity (anaerobic oxidation pathway). Manure fertilization offset the inhibiting effect of mineral N fertilization on CH4 production but stimulated CH4 oxidation. Among all fertilization treatments biochar strongly suppressed the CH4 turnover and can therefore be recommended for greenhouse gas mitigation strategy in cleaner rice production.

TI Kinetics and Thermodynamics Study of Methylene Blue Adsorption to
   Sucrose- and Urea-Derived Nitrogen-Enriched, Hierarchically Porous
   Carbon Activated by KOH and H3PO4
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Hierarchically porous nitrogen-enriched carbon materials synthesized by polymerization of sucrose and urea (SU) were activated by KOH and H3PO4 (SU-KOH and SU-H3PO4, respectively). Characterization was undertaken and the synthesized materials were tested for their ability to adsorb methylene blue (MB). Scanning electron microscopic images along with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis revealed the presence of a hierarchically porous system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the surface oxidation of SU upon activation with KOH and H3PO4. The best conditions for removing dyes utilizing both activated adsorbents were determined by varying the pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and dye concentration. Adsorption kinetics were evaluated, and the adsorption of MB followed second-order kinetics, suggesting the chemisorption of MB to both SU-KOH and SUH3PO4. Times taken to reach the equilibrium by SU-KOH and SU-H3PO4 were 180 and 30 min, respectively. The adsorption isotherm data were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin models. Data were best described by the Temkin isotherm model for SU-KOH and the Freundlich isotherm model for SU-H3PO4. Thermodynamics of the adsorption of MB to the adsorbent was determined by varying the temperature in the range of 25-55 degrees C. Adsorption of MB increased with increasing temperature, suggesting that the adsorption process is endothermic. The highest adsorption capacities of SU-KOH and SU-H3PO4 (1268 and 897 mg g-1, respectively) were obtained at 55 degrees C. Synthesized adsorbents were effective in removing MB for five cycles with some loss in activity. The results of this study show that SU activated by KOH and H3PO4 are environmentally benign, favorable, and effective adsorbents for MB adsorption.

TI Oxo-vanadium(IV) unsymmetrical Schiff base complex immobilized on
   γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles: A novel and magnetically
   recoverable nanocatalyst for selective oxidation of sulfides and
   oxidative coupling of thiols
SO APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB In this research, an unsymmetrical salen-type oxo-vanadium(IV) complex, [VO(salenac-OH)] (salenac-OH = [9-(2 ',4 '-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,8-diaza-4-methylnona-2,4,8-trienato](-2)), was synthesized and covalently immobilized on the surface of magnetic gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The resulting gamma-Fe2O3@[VO(salenac-OH)] nanoparticles were characterized by several techniques including Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and elemental analysis. The prepared gamma-Fe2O3@[VO(salenac-OH)] nanoparticle was utilized as an efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides using 30% H2O2 as oxidant and oxidative coupling of thiols into disulfides with urea/H2O2 (UHP) as an oxidizing reagent. The products were achieved with good to excellent yields at room temperature with no over-oxidation of sulfoxides and disulfides to unexpected by-products. This catalyst can be magnetically recovered by applying an external magnet and reused for five continuous cycles in both oxidation reactions without a significant loss in its catalytic activity. Furthermore, the FT-IR spectrum and XRD pattern of the recovered catalyst showed no critical change to those of the fresh one.

TI Polytriazine imide-LiCl semiconductor for highly efficient
   photooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Ionothermal synthesis of carbon nitride paved the way to a new structural allotrope-polytriazine imide. In this work, we screen available precursors for pristine polytriazine imides and for their graphitic analogs narrowing it to the melamine-urea mixture as the most promising starting material. Photocatalytic activity of materials verified in reaction of benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, which is known to be highly requested chemical with thousands of tons of annual production. Therefore "green" and selective route of production is highly desired. Developed PTI-LiCl was tested for selective photooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, demonstrating precious conversion and selectivity rates-96.3% and 91.6%, respectively after 5 hours of UV irradiation. Detailed physical-chemical characterization revealed that PTI materials possessed more ordered and highly condensed structure which grant them improved photocatalytic properties in comparison to graphitic carbon nitride polymorph.

TI Lattice contraction-driven design of highly efficient and stable O -NiFe
   layered double hydroxide electrocatalysts for water oxidation
SO MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS
AB The slow progress of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key challenge in advancing water splitting as a viable technology for sustainable hydrogen production. Utilizing a self -standing NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a promising approach to address the slow kinetics of OER. Herein, the oxidized Fe 2+ -containing NiFeLDH supported on Ni foam (O - NiFe-LDH@NF) is developed through corrosion engineering and aging. The growth mechanism is studied by adjusting urea content, hydrothermal temperature and time. It is revealed that the transformation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ in Fe 2+ -containing NiFe-LDH and the increase of Fe content leads to lattice contraction. Furthermore, detailed experiments and theoretical simulations illustrate that the substantial Fe content and lattice shrinkage promote the generation of Ni in high oxidation state and enhance the adsorption affinity toward the reaction species. Consequently, O - NiFe-LDH@NF exhibits enhanced OER activity and stability, with an exceptionally low overpotential of 197 mV and 354 mV observed at the current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm -2 , respectively, and remarkable stability over 300 h. This approach can be generalized for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

TI High catalytic performances of CeO2-CrOx
   catalysts for chlorinated VOCs elimination
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB A series of porous CeO2-CrOx, mixed oxides are synthesized using different precipitants (NaOH, NH4OH, (NH4)(2)CO3 and urea) and evaluated for deep oxidation of various chlorinated VOCs (CH2Cl2, C2HCl3, C2H4Cl2 and C6H5Cl). The results show that all these materials represent porous structures and small particle sizes (2-8 nm). Part of Cr element can go into the lattice of CeO2, resulting in the formation of Ce-Cr-O mixed oxide. Compared with pure CeO2 and Cr2O3, the amount of Cr6+ species and oxygen vacancies in CeO2-CrOx, mixed oxides are significantly increased, due to the strong interaction between CeO2 and CrOx. Thus, all the CeO2-CrOx mixed oxides exhibit high catalytic activity and good durability for deep oxidation of chlorinated VOCs, especially the CeO2-CrOx prepared using (NH4)(2)CO3 as precipitant. Moreover, only slight chlorinated byproducts are detected in the process of chlorinated VOCs oxidation, and the surface accumulation of coke and Cl species as well as the loss of Cr element is slight during the long-term reaction at 265 degrees C, indicating that these CeO2-CrOx materials possess interesting fundamental result, deserving more research before conclusion on practical value.

   activity for the selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols
SO INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Two new oxovanadium and dioxomolybdenum Schiff base complexes, [VvO(L)(OCH3)(CH3OH)] and [MoVIO2(L) (CH2CH3OH)], were synthesized by treating an ONO-donor type Schiff base ligand (H2L) derived by condensation of 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde and nicotinic hydrazide with oxo and dioxo acetylacetonate salts of vanadium and molybdenum, [VO(acac)2 and MoO2(acac)2], respectively. The synthesized ligand and complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques like FT-IR, multinuclear (1H, 13C) NMR, elemental analysis and the most authentic single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In both complexes the geometry around the central metal ions was distorted octahedral as revealed by the data collected from diffraction studies. Theoretical calculation of the synthesized compounds were carried out by DFT as well as TD-DFT using B3LYP method by employing the Def2-TZVP basis set. The findings of theoretical data indicated that the calculated results are in accordance with the experimental findings. Moreover, the catalytic efficiencies of both complexes were investigated by oxidizing the benzylic alcohols in the presence of urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in acetonitrile.

TI Boosting alkaline water splitting and the urea electrolysis kinetic
   process of a Co3O4 nanosheet by electronic
   structure modulation of F, P co-doping
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Designing non-precious metal electrocatalysts for accelerated electron transfer and richer active site exposure is necessary and challenging to achieve the versatility of electrocatalysts. In this research, a self-grown nanosheet array electrocatalyst on nickel foam with high structural stability is first rationally designed through suitable anionic doping. The combined experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the F-P-Co3O4/NF material optimizes the adsorption energy of hydrogen/water through electron coupling, and its nanosheet structure provides abundant active sites, accelerating the mass and electron transfer in the reaction process. It is worth noting that the as-developed F-P-Co3O4/NF materials exhibit outstanding catalytic activity for overpotentials of 192 and 110 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH, respectively. More notably, an assembled F-P-Co3O4/NF//F-P-Co3O4/NF alkaline electrolytic cell requires only an ultra-low cell voltage of 1.53 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is one of the best activities reported so far. Furthermore, F-P-Co3O4/NF also shows excellent performance for urea electrolysis. Theoretical calculations show that the superior activity of the F-P-Co3O4/NF catalyst is attributed to the optimal electron configuration and the lower Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption due to co-doping of P and F. The work provides an alternative solution for the preparation of electrocatalysts with high structural stability, high catalytic activity and multifunction for alkaline water splitting and urea electrolysis.

TI Recycling of nitrogen-containing waste diapers for catalytic contaminant
   oxidation: Occurrence of radical and non-radical pathways
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The transformation of waste biomass into nitrogen-doped carbon-based functional materials is recognized as an economical route for energy production and conversion. Waste diapers contain urea that could be used as a nitrogen source, were considered renewable biomass. BPA, a widely used environmental endocrine disruptor, produces estrogen effects in the human body and is characterized by low concentrations and high toxicity in the environment. Here, a simple method of obtaining cobalt embedded waste diaper carbon (Co-WDC) using abandoned diapers is reported and used for an advanced oxidation process. Co-WDC completely removed 20 mg L-1 BPA from a solution within 6 min with a degradation rate constant of 0.68 min(-1). The LC-MS test revealed that BPA is decomposed into small molecules, and TOC was greatly reduced. Electron paramagnetic resonance and quenching experiments demonstrated the Co-WDC degradation system acted through two pathways, radical and non-radical pathway where O-1(2) was the dominant species. Material characterization and discussion of the mechanism revealed that the introduction of Co mainly formed a metal-nitrogen structure that induced peroxymonosulfate to produce O-1(2), which participated in BPA degradation in the Co-WDC system. This work should generate interest in the recycling of waste biomass for peroxymonosulfate activation and environmental modification.

TI Trimetallic nanoplate arrays of Ni-Fe-Mo sulfide on FeNi3
   foam: A highly efficient and bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall
   water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB One of the challenges to realize large-scale water splitting is the lack of highly active and low-cost electrocatalysts for its two half reactions: hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). In this work, a Mo doping approach is adopted to enhance the HER and OER bifunctionality of NiFe-LDH. The catalyst MoNiFeSx@FeNi3 obtained after sulfidation exhibits further improved catalytic performance and good stability. In KOH solution (1.0 M), ultralow overpotentials of 67 mV and 142 mV work well to reach current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, separately. In urea (0.33 M) and KOH (1.0 M) solutions, catalyst urea oxidation reaction can be significantly promoted by MoNiFeSx@FeNi3, and can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under the condition of 1.31 V.

TI Switching from Fatty Acid Oxidation to Glycolysis Improves the Outcome
   of Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has a high mortality rate. Metabolic reprogramming is an important mechanism for cell survival. Herein, the metabolic patterns of ACLF patients are analyzed. An in vitro model of ACLF is established using Chang liver cells under hyperammonemia and hypoxia. A randomized clinical trial (ChiCTR-OPC-15006839) is performed with patients receiving L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) daily intravenously (LOLA group) and trimetazidine (TMZ) tid orally (TMZ group) based on conventional treatment (control group). The primary end point is 90-day overall survival, and overall survival is the secondary end point. By analyzing metabolic profiles in liver tissue samples from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related ACLF patients and the controls, the metabolic characteristics of HBV-related ACLF patients are identified: inhibited glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and urea cycle, and enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and glutamine anaplerosis. These effects are mainly attributed to hyperammonemia and hypoxia. Further in vitro study reveals that switching from FAO to glycolysis could improve hepatocyte survival in the hyperammonemic and hypoxic microenvironment. Importantly, this randomized clinical trial confirms that inhibiting FAO using TMZ improves the prognosis of patients with HBV-related ACLF. In conclusion, this study provides a practical strategy for targeting metabolic reprogramming using TMZ to improve the survival of patients with HBV-related ACLF.

TI Probing the Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species by a Porous
   Self-Assembled Benzophenone Bis-Urea Host
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Herein, we examine the photochemical formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a porous benzophenone-containing bis-urea host (1) to investigate the mechanism of photooxidations that occur within the confines of its nanochannels. UV irradiation of the self-assembled host in the presence of molecular oxygen generates both singlet oxygen and superoxide when suspended in solution. The efficiency of ROS generation by the host is lower than that of benzophenone (BP), which could be beneficial for reactions carried out catalytically, as ROS species react quickly and often unselectively. Superoxide formation was detected through reaction with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide in the presence of methanol. However, it is not detected in CHCl3, as it reacts rapidly with the solvent to generate methaneperoxy and chloride anions, similar to BP. The lifetime of airborne singlet oxygen (tau(Delta airborne)) was examined at the air-solid outer surface of the host and host.quencher complexes and suggests that quenching is a surface phenomenon. The efficiency of the host and BP as catalysts was compared for the photooxidation of 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene in solution. Both the host and BP mediate the photooxidation in CHCl3, benzene, and benzene-d(6), producing primarily epoxide-derived products with low selectivity likely by both type I and type II photooxidation processes. Interestingly, in CHCl3, two chlorohydrins were also formed, reflecting the formation of chloride in this solvent. In contrast, UV irradiation of the host.guest crystals in an oxygen atmosphere produced no epoxide and appeared to favor mainly the type II processes. Photolysis afforded high conversion to only three products: an enone, a tertiary allylic alcohol, and a diol, which demonstrates the accessibility of the encapsulated reactants to oxygen and the influence of confinement on the reaction pathway.

TI Effects of Adding Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes on Performance of Polyvinyl
   Acetate and Urea-Formaldehyde Adhesives in Tropical Timber Species
SO JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS
AB Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) functionalized with hydroxyl groups (MWCNTs-OH) have been incorporated into polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) and urea-formaldehyde (UF) adhesives utilized in tropical wood gluing. The Raman spectroscopy, the atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to describe the MWCNTs-OH. The adhesives were evaluated in three concentrations ofMWCNTs-OH: 0% (control), 0.05%, and 0.1%. The evaluation included color, the distribution of MWCNTs-OH by TEM and AFM, thermal stability and viscosity of the adhesives, and shear strength (SS) of the glue line for nine tropical woods. AFM and TEM confirmed interaction of MWCNTs-OH with adhesives. The viscosity of the PVAc adhesive increases with added MWCNTs-OH. The incorporation of MWCNTs-OH in PVAc and UF resin produces wood adhesives with less brightness, less yellowness, and increased redness. The nanotubes in the adhesive improved the thermal stability of the composites and increased the entropy factor and energy of activation in the kinetic decomposition of the resin. In relation to SS, MWCNTs-OH in any of the two concentrations had no significant effect on SS in dry condition in half of the species studied glued with PVAc adhesive, whereas, for UF-adhesive, the SS and percentage of wood failure improved in most of the 9 species studied.

TI Tailoring the reducibility and catalytic activity of CuO nanoparticles
   for low temperature CO oxidation
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles have received considerable interest as active and inexpensive catalysts for various gas-solid reactions. The CuO reducibility and surface reactivity are of crucial importance for the high catalytic activity. Herein, we demonstrate that the reducibility and stability of CuO nanoparticles can be controlled and tailored for the high catalytic activity of CO oxidation. The synthesized CuO nanoparticles possessed enhanced reducibility in CO atmosphere at lower reduction temperature of 126 degrees C compared to 284 degrees C for that of reference CuO particles. Moreover, the CuO catalysts with tailored reducibility demonstrated a reaction rate of 35 mol s(-1) g(-1) and an apparent activation energy of 75 kJ mol(-1). Furthermore, the tailored catalysts exhibited excellent long-term stability for CO oxidation for up to 48 h on stream. These readily-reducible CuO nanoparticles could serve as efficient, inexpensive and durable catalysts for CO oxidation at low temperatures.

TI Direct oxidation of adsorbed petroleum hydrocarbons by activating
   persulfate with Fe/Mn-SOM complex preformed in-situ for heavily
   contaminated soil remediation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Although the activation of persulfate (PS) by exogenous activators for the removal of adsorbed total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) in soil has been widely reported, the ineffective consumption of the reactive oxygen species (ROSs) during the process of diffusion to the surface of soil particles has received little attention. In this study, a novel Fe/Mn oxide cross-linked with soil organic matter (Fe/Mn-SOM complex) was successfully preformed in situ. Characterization analysis revealed the dominant components of Fe/Mn-SOM complex were mainly FeOOH and MnO2, which bound to SOM through -COOH, O-H, and C-O-C interactions. In Fe/Mn-SOM/PS system, the removal efficiencies reached 75.74 % for TPHs (23042 mg/kg), 71.02 % for alkanes (13646 mg/kg), and 80.60 % for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, 4712 mg/kg), representing an increase of 19.98 similar to 32.29 % compared to the (Fe2++ Mn2+)/PS system. Furthermore, the Fe/Mn-SOM complex exhibited resistance to common organic matter in the soil, such as humic acids, urea, and lignin. Radical capture and quenching experiments indicated that sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot(-)), hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), and superoxide radicals (O-2 center dot(-)) played key roles in TPHs removal in the Fe/Mn-SOM system. It can be inferred that Fe/Mn-SOM-PS* formed through electron transfer accelerated the activation of PS, with SO4 center dot(-) and center dot OH generated on the surface of the Fe/Mn-SOM complex directly oxidizing nearby petroleum hydrocarbons through ternary complexes (TPHs-Fe/Mn-SOM complex). O-2 center dot(-) also contributed to the reduction of Fe and Mn active species, facilitating PS activation for TPHs removal. Furthermore, potential degradation pathways of TPHs were proposed using GC-MS in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study offers a fresh perspective on the chemical remediation of petroleum-contaminated soil.

TI Ni<SUP>2+</SUP> Tailoring Pd Enables Nanonet-Structured Catalysts with
   Dual Doping of H and Ni for Enhanced Alcohol Oxidation
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is a crucial process in direct ethanol fuel cells. Although Pd exhibits potential as a substitute for Pt in EOR, its development is still hampered by its inferior activity due to its limited ability to break C-C bonds and the poisoning by strongly adsorbed intermediates. Herein, a one-step method for the preparation of NiPdH network nanomaterials (NiPdH NNs) was proposed with ethylene glycol (EG) as a H source. We explored the influence of preparation parameters on NiPdH NNs and examined the versatility of doping Pd with multiple metals and H in a one-step preparation method. These results demonstrated that urea can significantly influence the morphology of the samples. Additionally, the addition of metal sources had a crucial impact on the insertion of H. The doping of H and Ni can modify the electronic structure of Pd and might further modulate the adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface. Compared with PdNi nanoparticles without H atoms, NiPdH nanoparticles, and commercial Pd/C, NiPdH NN catalysts possessed the largest electrochemical active surface area and the smallest charge transfer resistance. Consequently, NiPdH NNs presented a strong resistance to CO poisoning, superior mass activities and catalytic stabilities in ethanol, methanol, and EG oxidation reactions. The significant enhancement in performance can be attributed to several factors. First, the oxyphilic metal Ni can promote the generation of OH* and accelerate the removal of CO. Second, the doping of H and Ni effectively regulates the electronic structure of Pd, optimizing the adsorption behaviors of reaction intermediates. Lastly, the network structure provides an abundance of catalytic active sites, promoting efficient mass transfer and overall reaction kinetics. This study offers valuable insights for the preparation of Pd-based hydrides with specific structures.

TI Survival strategies of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in a full-scale
   WWTP treating mixed landfill leachate containing copper ions and
   operating at low-intensity of aeration
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Recent studies indicate that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) may play an important role in nitrogen removal by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, our knowledge of the mechanisms employed by AOA for growth and survival in full-scale WWTPs is still limited. Here, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses combined with a laboratory cultivation experiment revealed that three active AOAs (WS9, WS192, and WS208) belonging to family Nitrososphaeraceae were active in the deep oxidation ditch (DOD) of a full-scale WWTP treating landfill leachate, which is configured with three continuous aerobic anoxic (OA) modules with low-intensity aeration (<= 1.5 mg/L). AOA coexisted with AOB and complete ammonia oxidizers (Comammox), while the ammonia-oxidizing microbial (AOM) community was unexpectedly dominated by the novel AOA strain WS9. The low aeration, long retention time, and relatively high inputs of ammonium and copper might be responsible for the survival of AOA over AOB and Comammox, while the dominance of WS9, specifically may be enhanced by substrate preference and uniquely encoded retention strategies. The urease-negative WS9 is specifically adapted for ammonia acquisition as evidenced by the high expression of an ammonium transporter, whereas two metabolically versatile urease-positive AOA strains (WS192 and WS208) can likely supplement ammonia needs with urea. This study provides important information for the survival and application of the eutrophic Nitrososphaeraceae AOA and advances our understanding of archaea-dominated ammonia oxidation in a full-scale wastewater treatment system.

TI SWI/SNF complex subunit BAF60a represses hepatic ureagenesis through a
   crosstalk between YB-1 and PGC-1α
SO MOLECULAR METABOLISM
AB Objective: Ureagenesis predominantly occurs in the liver and functions to remove ammonia, and the dysregulation of ureagenesis leads to the development of hyperammonemia. Recent studies have shown that ureagenesis is under the control of nutrient signals, but the mechanism remains elusive. Therefore, intensive investigation of the molecular mechanism underlying ureagenesis will shed some light on the pathology of metabolic diseases related to ammonia imbalance.
   Methods: Mice were fasted for 24 h or fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. For human evaluation, we obtained a public data set including 41 obese patients with and without hepatic steatosis. We analyzed the expression levels of hepatic BAF60a under different nutrient status. The impact of BAF60a on ureagenesis and hyperammonemia was assessed by using gain- and loss-of-function strategies. The molecular chaperons mediating the effects of BAF60a on ureagenesis were validated by molecular biological strategies.
   Results: BAF60a was induced in the liver of both fasted and HFD-fed mice and was positively correlated with body mass index in obese patients. Liver-specific overexpression of BAF60a inhibited hepatic ureagenesis, leading to the increase of serum ammonia levels. Mechanistically, BAF60a repressed the transcription of Cps1, a rate-limiting enzyme, through interaction with Y-box protein 1 (YB-1) and by switching the chromatin structure of Cps1 promoter into an inhibitory state. More importantly, in response to different nutrient status, PGC-1 alpha (as a transcriptional coactivator) and YB-1 competitively bound to BAF60a, thus selectively regulating hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation and ureagenesis.
   Conclusion: The BAF60a-YB-1 axis represses hepatic ureagenesis, thereby contributing to hyperammonemia under overnutrient status. Therefore, hepatic BAF60a may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of overnutrient-induced urea cycle disorders and their associated diseases. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

TI Temperature-dependent evolution of hydroxyl radicals from
   peroxymonosulfate activation over nitrogen-modified carbon nanotubes
SO SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES
AB Rational regulation of redox capacity in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) bymetal-free nanomaterials is appealing to extend the state-of-the-art carbocatalysis toward diverse applications. In this study, nitrogendecorated single-walled carbon nanotubes (N-SWCNT) were fabricated using urea as a green precursor under thermal pyrolysis. We comprehensively investigated the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation at varying temperatures with/without the nanocarbon toward nitrobenzene (NB) oxidation. In the noncatalytic system, NB decomposition rate was impressively boosted with the raising reaction temperatures. More importantly, hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) were unveiled to be the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contributed to NB degradation under high temperatures in PMS/N-SWCNT system. The mechanism of PMS activation with/without N-SWCNT and impact of temperature were elucidated by both in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique and selectively radical quenching tests. Interestingly, the NB degradation kinetics witnessed a two-stage process with different activation energies in PMS only and PMS/N-SWCNT systems, suggesting that the reaction temperaturemay be able to tune the catalytic mechanism and generated ROS. Therefore, the nanocarbon-catalyzed and thermal-assisted metal-free AOPs can be featured with maneuverable oxidative potentials toward a wide range of redox processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Cocuring of Epoxidized Soybean Oil-Based Wood Adhesives and the Enhanced
   Bonding Performance by Plasma Treatment of Wood Surfaces
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Application of epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) in thewood industry as an adhesive has been limited due to the difficultyin fast curing ESO. Due to the advantages of the urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin, like low cost, high molecular weight,rich functional groups, as well as fast self-curing property, fastcocuring ESO-UF adhesives were prepared by mixing UF withESO in different ratios (15-50%). Bonding performance testsindicated that the ESO-UF adhesives well balanced bondingstrengths and the formaldehyde emission level; especially, theadhesives provided satisfactory water resistance. Structuralcharacterization of cured ESO-UF adhesives showed that acopolymerization reaction occurred between epoxy groups ofESO and the hydroxyl groups of UF. Combined with gliding arcdischarge (GAD) plasma treatment of the veneer surface, better bonding performances were achieved. X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS) analysis on the wood surfaces showed that the GAD treatment significantly increased the content of oxygen-containing groups like-OH and-COOH through oxidation and degradation of the chemical components on the wood surface.The generated reactive groups on the wood surface participated in the curing reaction of ESO-UF adhesives and led to improvedbonding performances. Thus, the ESO-UF-activated wood surface (ESO-UF-AWS) system was developed in this study. The resultsof this study have demonstrated that the combination of seeking an efficient cocuring agent along with activating the wood surface isa valid strategy for realizing applications of ESO in the wood product industry

TI Roles of malate and aspartate in gluconeogenesis in various
   physiological and pathological states
SO METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL
AB Gluconeogenesis, a pathway for glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate substances, begins with the synthesis of oxaloacetate (OA) from pyruvate and intermediates of citric acid cycle in hepatocyte mitochondria. The traditional view is that OA does not cross the mitochondrial membrane and must be shuttled to the cytosol, where most enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis are compartmentalized, in the form of malate. Thus, the possibility of transporting OA in the form of aspartate has been ignored.In the article is shown that malate supply to the cytosol increases only when fatty acid oxidation in the liver is activated, such as during starvation or untreated diabetes. Alternatively, aspartate synthesized from OA by mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is transported to the cytosol in exchange for glutamate via the aspartate-glutamate carrier 2 (AGC2). If the main substrate for gluconeogenesis is an amino acid, aspartate is converted to OA via urea cycle, therefore, ammonia detoxification and gluconeogenesis are simultaneously activated. If the main substrate is lactate, OA is synthesized by cytosolic AST, glutamate is transported to the mitochondria through AGC2, and nitrogen is not lost. It is concluded that, compared to malate, aspartate is a more suitable form of OA transport from the mitochondria for gluconeogenesis.

TI Synthesis of Co4N nanoparticles via a urea-glass route toward
   bifunctional cathode for high-performance Li-O2 batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Rechargeable lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are considered as one of the most ideal energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density. However, the practical application of Li-O2 batteries is hindered by their slow reaction kinetics and various notorious side reactions, which causing inferior redox over -potentials. Herein, Co4N nanoparticles electrode with low agglomeration by using a urea-glass route at moderate temperatures is proposed to address the above challenges. It shows high electron conductivity since it retained metallic cobalt crystal structure. In addition, the efficiently catalytic activity of Co4N can effectively suppress side reactions by reducing the charging polarization and expand the reaction kinetics. The DFT results demonstrate that the electronic structure change of Co4N crystal plays an important role in improving ORR activity. The overpotential for ORR increases in Co4N/N-CNTs is much easier to implement within the applied potential, and thus leading to a better catalytic performance toward ORR. Meanwhile, coupling with nitrogen can effectively optimize the electronic structure of Co4N sites in N-CNTs, thereby reducing the energy barrier of reaction intermediates to promote the reversible ORR kinetics process. Benefiting from the above advantages, the Co4N/N-CNTs delivers improved long-term cycling stability (80 cycles under O2 atmosphere) under the capacity limited at 500 mAh g-1 and current density at 200 mA g-1. This work suggests an effective pathway to fabricate the metal nitrides with efficiently catalytic activity.

TI Mechanistic studies on the conversion of NO gas on urea-iron and copper
   metal organic frameworks at low temperature conditions: in situ infrared
   spectroscopy and Monte Carlo investigations
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from high-temperature combustion processes under fuel-lean conditions continue to be a challenge for the energy industry. Selective catalytic reduction ( SCR) is possible using metal oxides and zeolites. There is still a need to identify catalytic materials that are efficient in reducing NOx to environmentally benign nitrogen gas at temperatures lower than 200 degrees C. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a class of highly porous materials with unique physical and chemical properties. This study is motivated by the lack of systematic investigations on SCR using MOFs under industrially relevant conditions. Here, we investigate the extent of NO conversion with two commercially available MOFs, Basolite F300 (Fe- BTC) and HKUST-1 (Cu-BTC), mixed with solid urea as a source for the reductant, ammonia gas. For comparison, experiments were also conducted using cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) as a non-porous counterpart to relate its reactivity to those obtained from MOFs. Fourier- transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was utilized to identify the gas and surface species in the temperature range of 115-180 degrees C. Computational analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the adsorption energies of different surface species. The results show that the rate of ammonia production from the in situ solid urea decomposition was higher using CoFe2O4 than Fe-BTC and Cu-BTC and that there was very limited conversion of NO on the mixed solid urea-MOF systems due to site blocking. The main conclusions from this study are that MOFs have limited ability to convert NO under low-temperature conditions and that surface regeneration requires additional experimental steps.

TI 3D-printed Al 2 O 3 framework supported carbon-bridged tri-s-triazine of
   g-C 3 N 4 for photocatalytic tetracycline oxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Powder -like g-C 3 N 4 has been widely used as a photocatalyst but exhibits several drawbacks, including unrecyclable, high charge recombination, and limited light absorption. In this study, carbon -bridged g-C 3 N 4 was successfully prepared and coated on a 3D -printed Al 2 O 3 substrate for the photocatalytic oxidation of tetracycline. Oxamide (OD), malonamide (MD), and succinamide (SD) were used as carbon -containing linkers to react with precursors (melamine and urea) and produce carbon -bridged g-C 3 N 4 . Carbon substitution at the bridged N atoms of g-C 3 N 4 improved light absorption, reduced charge recombination, and resulted in high photocatalytic tetracycline removal efficiency. Computational calculations were also employed, and Bader charge analysis supported the charge redistribution and charge transfer of the carbon -bridged g-C 3 N 4 samples. Our results indicated that the degradation of tetracycline followed step-by-step oxidation, deamination, and mineralization to form CO 2 and H 2 O. The 3D -printed Al 2 O 3 -supported carbon -bridged g-C 3 N 4 exhibited a high removal rate of 85 - 90 % and stability for photocatalytic reactions and can be reused for at least 10 cycles. This study demonstrates that the 3D -printed Al 2 O 3 -supported carbon -bridged g-C 3 N 4 catalyst is an efficient and effective catalyst support system for photocatalytic reactions.

TI Influence of hydrocarbon species on its adsorption on a VSCR catalyst
   under simulated diesel engine operating conditions
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Vanadia-SCR (VSCR) is a proven technology for reducing diesel engine NOx emissions using urea hydrolysis derived NH3 as a reductant. It is also known that VSCR is active for hydrocarbon (HC) oxidation. However, HC species from diesel engine exhaust may be adsorbed onto VSCR at low exhaust temperatures such as under low engine load or idle conditions. The adsorbed HC may be gradually transformed into more stable coke during engine operation. The accumulated HC or coke on VSCR can result in decreased NOx conversion efficiency due to blockage of catalyst pores and active sites. In addition, rapid oxidation of accumulated HC or coke can lead to exotherms which can thermally damage the VSCR and may lead to vanadium and tungsten release. This work investigates the fundamental adsorption characteristics of HC species on a state-of-the-art VSCR catalyst in the low temperature region. Dodecane and toluene are used as model molecules for alkane and aromatic species from unburned diesel fuel, while squalane is used as a model molecule for unburned lube oil. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Calcined Nickel Oxide Nanostructures at Different Temperatures Onto
   Graphite for Efficient Electro-Oxidation of Ethylene Glycol in Basic
   Electrolyte
SO APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB Fabricating a highly active and stable nanocatalyst material displays a great concern when constructing a commercially viable ethylene glycol (EG) fuel cell. Herein, nickel oxide nanostructures were grown onto graphite (NO/T) using coprecipitation and calcination protocol at different temperatures. Techniques for XRD, TEM, SEM, and EDX investigations were used to look into the produced crystal planes, shape, and elemental mapping of synthesized nickel oxide nanoparticles. Different NO/T nanocatalyst electroactivities were examined in order to oxidize EG molecules in basic electrolyte. The surface area values of calcined nanostructures at 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C were much higher than those measured at NO/T-400 by 7.62 and 3.71 folds to explain their outstanding performance. Some kinetic information for varied NO/T nanocatalysts was derived including the electron transfer coefficient, rate constant, and surface coverage values. Electron transfer rate constants of 0.1946, 0.3734, 0.0113, and 0.0303 s-1 were calculated at NO/T-200, NO/T-300, NO/T-400, and NO/T-500, respectively. Increased oxidation current densities could be achieved when NO/T nanomaterials were subjected to lowered calcination temperatures. NO/T-200 and NO/T-300 nanocatalysts also displayed decreased Eonset for alcohol oxidation process by 20 and 41 mV in relation to that at NO/T-400. Moreover, chronoamperometric experiments revealed the prevalence of the stable behavior during EG oxidation at these nanostructures, especially for calcined ones at 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C. Much reduced poisoning rates were measured at NO/T-200 (0.171 s-1) and NO/T-300 (0.067 s-1) when contrasted to that at NO/T-500 (0.727 s-1). Increasing the alcohol and supporting electrolyte concentrations was beneficial in improving the charge transfer characteristics of NO/T nanocatalysts as demonstrated by EIS measurements. This study supports the promising activity of NiO nanoparticles onto graphite as anode materials for direct alcohol fuel cells.
   Nickel oxide nanoparticles were chemically deposited onto graphite surface using coprecipitation protocol with calcination at varied temperatures. The electroactivity of fabricated NO/T nanomaterials was examined for ethylene glycol (EG) electro-oxidation in basic solution. The increased surface area and uniform dispersion of calcined NO/T nanomaterials at decreased temperatures could explain their reduced Eonset and enhanced Ip values. A stable performance was also observed for all examined nanopowders when oxidizing EG molecules for long periods. EIS measurements revealed the promoted charge transfer at NO/T surfaces to support their outstanding electrocatalytic behavior towards EG electro-oxidation in alkaline electrolyte.image

TI Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanoflakes by Acidic Charring of Microcrystalline
   Cellulose and Urea for the Rapid Removal of Imidacloprid from Water
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Herein, cellulose as a natural biomass along with urea was acid-charred to synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflakes (N-CNF). The as-prepared N-CNF was used to rapidly remove the effluent of agricultural waste containing an Imidacloprid (IMD) insecticide. The adsorption data fit well to nonlinearly in the Sips adsorption model, which is a mixed Langmuir-Freundlich model with an adsorption capacity of similar to 104.9 mg g(-1). The adsorption follows pseudo-second-order kinetics linearly and nonlinearly, and thermodynamic parameters reveal that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. The effect of pH and the interference of ions was also checked. Further, spiking of IMD in different soil, lake, and tap wastewater samples was also done to enhance the practical applicability of removing IMD by N-CNF. The antibacterial properties of N-CNF were checked on both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilus, respectively, where they showed nontoxic behavior up to the concentration of 2 mg mL(-1).

TI Electro-oxidation and UV irradiation coupled method for in-site removing
   pollutants from human body fluids in swimming pool
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB A comprehensive study was conducted to investigate how ultraviolet (UV) irradiation combined with electrochemistry (EC) can efficiently remove human body fluids (HBFs) related pollutants, such as urea/creatinine/ hippuric acid, from swimming pool water (SPW). In comparison with the chlorination, UV, EC, and UV/chlorine treatments, the EC/UV treatment exhibited the highest removal rates for these typical pollutants (TPs) from HBFs in synthetic SPW. Specifically, increasing the operating current of the EC/UV process from 20 to 60 mA, as well as NaCl content from 0.5 to 3.0 g/L, improved urea and creatinine degradation while having no influence on hippuric acid. In contrast, EC/UV process was resilient to changes in water parameters (pH, HCO3- , and actual water matrix). Urea removal was primarily attributable to reactive chlorine species (RCS), whereas creatinine and hippuric acid removal were primarily related to hydroxyl radical, UV photolysis, and RCS. In addition, the EC/UV procedure can lessen the propensity for creatinine and hippuric acid to generate disinfection by-products. We can therefore draw the conclusion that the EC/UV process is a green and efficient in-situ technology for removing HBFs related TPs from SPW with the benefits of needless chlorine-based chemical additive, easy operation, continuous disinfection efficiency, and fewer byproducts production.

TI Ni-Ni3P nanoparticles embedded into N, P-doped carbon on 3D
   graphene frameworks via in situ phosphatization of

   electrocatalytic hydrogen production and anodic degradation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB The development of new, clean and efficient catalytic materials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has become extremely unstoppable. Herein, the heterostructural Ni-Ni3P nanoparticles embedded into N\P co-doped carbon shells on 3D graphene frameworks (Ni-Ni3P@NPC/rGO) was synthesized viaan in situ phosphatization of nickel well-integrated with the structure engineering of carbon matrix derived from saccharomycetes. The in-situ phosphating process of nickel using P source provided by saccharomycetes is particularly simple, economical and environmentally friendly. In addition, the as-prepared Ni-Ni3P@NPC/rGO exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance toward both HER (extremely low overpotential of 113 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)) and urea degradation reaction (UDR, only 1.38 V to attain 50 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, a two-electrode electrolyzer employing the 3D block electrode (Ni-Ni3P@NPC/rGO/GFB) couple on both cathode and anode, can produce higher current density with lower voltage in urea-based wastewater splitting less than pure water splitting (saved 448 mV to deliver 500 mA g(-1)).

TI Synergic mechanism of adsorption and metal-free catalysis for phenol
   degradation by N-doped graphene aerogel
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB 3D porous N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) aerogels were synthesized by a hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide (GO) with urea and following freeze-drying process. N-rGO aerogels have a high BET surface of 499.70 m(2)/g and a high N doping content (5.93-7.46 at%) including three kinds of N (graphitic, pyridinic and pyrrolic). Their high catalytic performance for phenol oxidation in aqueous solution was investigated by catalytic activation of persulfate (PS). We have demonstrated that N-rGO aerogels are promising metal-free catalysts for phenol removal. Kinetics studies indicate that phenol degradation follows first-order reaction kinetics with the reaction rate constant of 0.16799 min(-1) for NrGO-A(1:30). Interestingly, the comparison of direct catalytic oxidation with adsorption-catalytic oxidation experiments indicates that adsorption plays an important role in the catalytic oxidation of phenol by decreasing the phenol degradation time. Spin density and adsorption modeling demonstrates that graphitic N in N-rGO plays the most important role for the catalytic performance by inducing high positive charge densities to adjacent carbon atoms and facilitating phenol adsorption on these carbon sites. Furthermore, the activation mechanism of persulfate (PS) on N-rGO was first investigated by DFT method and PS can be activated to generate strongly oxidative radical (SO4.(-)) by transferring electrons to N-rGO.

TI Bibliometric Analysis of Nanostructured Anodes for Electro-Oxidative
   Wastewater Treatment
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Last decade, a growing emphasis on developing sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies for electro-oxidative wastewater treatment has catalyzed innovation and spurred research efforts worldwide. Researchers may explore the use of renewable energy sources to drive electrochemical processes, as well as the development of eco-friendly electrode materials for wastewater treatments. The integration of nanostructured anodes into the electrolytic system for wastewater treatment has led to significant advancements in the removal of pollutants via electro-oxidation. Despite the great number of research articles related to the development and use of nanostructured anodes for electro-oxidative wastewater treatment, to our knowledge, no bibliometric analysis has been published in this domain. Therefore, this work presents a bibliometric study of publications on the designated theme, retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database, which were published over the last decade. The visual and network analysis of co-authorship among authors, organizations, countries, co-citation of authors, citation of documents and sources, as well as the co-occurrence of author keywords was performed using two compatible pieces of scientometric software, namely VOSviewer (version 1.6.18) and CiteSpace (version 6.2.R4). From 2013 to 2023, there has been a gradual increase in the number of publications regarding the development and use of nanostructured anodes for electro-oxidative wastewater treatment. It suggests a steady advancement in this field. The People's Republic of China emerges as the most productive country, and it is a leader in international collaborations. Also, the United States of America, South Korea, and European Union countries have significant impacts on the research in this domain. The development and application of nanostructured materials for urea electro-oxidation is a main and prospective research theme. This bibliometric analysis allowed for the visualization of the present landscape and upcoming trends in this research field, thereby facilitating future collaborative research endeavors and knowledge exchange.

Ti(1-x)M (x) O-2 (M=Zr, Ce) was prepared by urea gelation/co-precipitation method, and characterized by N-2 adsorption, XRD and UV-vis spectra. UV irradiation greatly enhanced the adsorptive capacity and selectivity of TiO2-ZrO2 for organosulfur in model oil because organosulfur compounds were first photocatalytically oxidized to sulfoxides and sulfones over TiO2-ZrO2, which were then selectively adsorbed on the bifunctional material due to much higher polarities of generated sulfoxides and sulfones. The Ti/Zr molar ratio and calcination temperature were optimized to 5 : 5 and 500 A degrees C with the sulfur removal of 99.6% after reaction for 2 h under UV irradiation. After adding 25 wt% toluene into model oil, the sulfur removal could still reach 97.2% after reaction for 7 h. TiO2-ZrO2 could be well regenrated by washing with acetonitrile followed by thermal treatment in air.

TI Investigation of urea selective catalytic reduction system with catalyst
   coated ceramic monolith
SO JOURNAL OF CERAMIC PROCESSING RESEARCH
AB The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and fast-SCR retrofit systems effectively control the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission for the diesel engine exhaust, using adblue solution and catalyst. The performance characteristic of retrofit system with efficient catalyst and optimum flow channel design, without affecting the engine performance is still a challenging factor. The experimental work is done on a stationary diesel engine test bench coupled to the retrofit system in its exhaust, at steady-state condition. A pair of ceramic monolith coated with cerium oxide (CeO2) and zeolite (ZSM-5) catalysts are used for pre-oxidation and SCR chambers respectively. The catalysts are characterized by XRD method and dip coated over the ceramic monolith. The static mixer blade inside the middle retrofit pipe is used for homogenization and complete evaporation of adblue solution. The influences of NOx conversion efficiency of retrofit systems are investigated with the ZSM-5 catalyst and later combined with CeO2 catalyst. From the experimental results, it is observed that the fast-SCR retrofit system with static mixer blade has a better NOx conversion efficiency, with marginal decrease in engine brake thermal efficiency than the other retrofit systems at maximum brake power. The increase in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of the retrofit system causes the engine brake thermal efficiency to decrease marginally with increase in brake power.

TI Improvement of the electrocatalytic performance of platinum-free
   hierarchical Cu/polypyrrole/NiOx anode for methanol oxidation
   via changing the morphology of polypyrrole sublayer by self-assembled
   pyrrole monomers and overoxidation
SO SYNTHETIC METALS
AB Platinum-free electrocatalysts have been considered recently due to their low costs and high resistances against poisoning with reaction intermediates. In this work different electrocatalysts based on a matrix of polypyrrole, PPy, were examined for catalysis of methanol oxidation reaction, MOR. The copper substrates were covered by a PPy layer and NiOx nanoparticles were deposited electrochemically on it. The Cu/PPy/NiOx electrodes indicated catalytic performance for MOR. However, it was shown that the modification of the morphology of PPy, influenced its catalytic behavior. The self-assembly of pyrrole monomers on copper, prior to polymerization, led to the formation of tiny PPy nanoparticles between the common cauliflowers shaped PPy masses. The overoxidation was then carried out electrochemically and the PPy matrix encountered changes in morphology with micro/nano cracks. These changes in PPy morphology facilitated the diffusion of methanol electroactive species, which was verified by the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results. The enhancement of active surface area and reduction of diffusion resistance for modified electrodes caused significant increment of their electrocatalytic performance. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive Xray analysis and X-ray diffraction patterns were used for the characterization of the surface layers.

TI Changes in substrate utilisation and protein catabolism during multiday
   cycling in well-trained cyclists
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB There is a paucity of studies that have evaluated substrate utilisation and protein catabolism during multiday strenuous exercise in athletes. Eleven well-trained male cyclists completed 3h of race-simulated cycling on 4 consecutive days. Cyclist exercised 2h postprandially and with carbohydrate supplementation (~50g center dot h(-1)) during exercise. Whole body substrate utilisation was measured by indirect calorimetry, protein catabolism from sweat and urine urea excretion, and blood metabolite concentration was evaluated. Protein catabolism during exercise was significantly greater on days 2-4 (29.9 +/- 8.8; 34.0 +/- 11.2; 32.0 +/- 7.3g for days 2, 3, and 4, respectively) compared to day 1 (23.3 +/- 7.6g), P<0.05. Fat oxidation was greater at 21km (~45min) on days 2-4 (1.06 +/- 0.23; 1.08 +/- 0.25; 1.12 +/- 0.29g center dot min(-1)) compared to day 1 (0.74 +/- 0.23g center dot min(-1), P<0.05), but the rate of carbohydrate and fat oxidation was similar between days at 50 and 80km. Whole body substrate utilisation is altered on subsequent days of multiday prolonged strenuous cycling that includes a quicker transition to greater fat utilisation from exercise onset and a 28-46% greater reliance on endogenous protein catabolism on all successive days.

TI Ultrawide Hydrazine Concentration Monitoring Sensor Comprising Ir-Ni
   Nanoparticles Decorated with Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes in On-Site
   Alkaline Fuel Cell Operation
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB A highly sensitive amperometric hydrazine monitoring sensor offering an ultrawide dynamic range of 5 mu M to 1 M in alkaline media (e. g., 1 M KOH) was developed via co-electrodepositing iridium-nickel alloy nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Ir-Ni-MWCNTs) on a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode. The synergistic interaction of MWCNTs with Ir-Ni alloy NPs resulted in enlarged active surface area, rapid electron transfer, and alkaline media stability with an onset potential of -0.12 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) toward hydrazine oxidation. A limit of detection for hydrazine was 0.81 mu M with guaranteed reproducibility, repeatability, and storage stability alongside a superb selectivity toward ethanolamine, urea, dopamine, NaBH4, NH4OH, NaNO2, and Na2CO3. The sensor was finally applied to on-site monitoring of the carbon-free hydrazine concentration at the anode and cathode of a hydrazine fuel cell, providing more insight into the hydrazine oxidation process during cell operation.

TI Electrochemical oxidation of pharmaceuticals in synthetic fresh human
   urine: Using selective radical quenchers to reveal the dominant
   degradation pathways and the scavenging effects of individual urine
   constituents
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Electrochemical oxidation of fresh human urine is a promising method to prevent pharmaceuticals from being discharged into the environment. Here, we evaluate the importance of electro-generated oxidants and direct anodic oxidation for degradation of four pharmaceutical (cyclophosphamide (CP), carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and ibuprofen (IBP)) accounting for the scavenging effect of urine constituents using boron-doped diamond (BDD) and IrO2 electrodes. Allyl alcohol and tert-butanol were used as selective quenchers for adsorbed and dissolved radicals, respectively. In electrolyte containing only chloride and pharmaceuticals, we found that CBZ and SMX are primarily oxidized by electro-generated Cl-2 in the fluid boundary layer , and CP and IBP are primarily oxidized by physisorbed (OH)-O-center dot or chemisorbed chlorine (IrO3-Cl). Regarding the effects of other fresh urine constituents, urea, creatinine, and uric acid quench the dissolved reactive chlorine species (Cl-center dot/Cl-2(center dot-), HOCl, Cl-2, etc.). However, SO42- shows no effect on pharmaceutical degradation while H2PO4- and citrate ions quench IrO3- Cl resulting in a mixed kinetic and mass-transfer limiting oxidation of pharmaceuticals on IrO2. Citrate ions only quench the dissolved oxidants (surface adsorbed radicals are the dominant oxidants) leading to the pharmaceutical degradation limited by the mass transfer of pharmaceutical to BDD surface. This work provides an understanding of the significance of various pathways for pharmaceutical degradation, scavenging effect of urine constituents, and strategies for rapid pharmaceutical degradation in human urine.

TI Reference materials selection for the stable carbon isotope analysis of
   dissolved carbon using a wet oxidation system
SO RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Rationale Wet chemical oxidation combined with isotope ratio mass spectrometry has become a routine technique for analyzing the stable carbon isotope composition of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic (DIC) carbon. However, methodological inconsistencies between laboratories in using different reference materials lead to a discrepancy in results. We experimentally tested the precision and accuracy of the analysis of commonly available international reference materials and other chemicals potentially suitable for laboratory standards. Methods The solid international reference materials and other simple chemicals were used to prepare water solutions. A range of carbon concentrations was chosen to optimize tests for (1) precision and accuracy, (2) linearity, (3) detection limits, (4) memory effects, and (5) efficiency of DIC removal from a DOC/DIC mixtures. Samples were analyzed using an LC-IsoLink coupled with a Delta V Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Results The analytical setup had a negligible memory effect, good reproducibility (<0.21 parts per thousand) and accuracy (maximum difference from the true values <0.35 parts per thousand) for the analyzed organic compounds if approximately >= 9 x 10(-09) moles of dissolved carbon was injected into the system (similar to 11 mg C L-1 if a 10-mu L loop was used). Analyses of sodium bicarbonate or calcium carbonate solutions had a two-fold lower accuracy despite maintaining a high precision. Conclusions Aqueous solutions of international reference materials such as L-glutamic acids (USGS40, USGS41), benzoic acid (IAEA-601) and sucrose (IAEA-CH-6) can be successfully used for direct normalization of results to the VPDB scale. By contrast, analyses of caffeine and urea returned very reproducible but highly inaccurate results and these materials are not recommended for standards.

SO JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB This study addresses a significant micropollutant removal from actual human urine (AHU) through photovoltaic driven electrochemical treatment. This study showed significant reductions of 69.09 % urea, 67.95 % creatinine, and 95.180 % uric acid under optimal continuous recirculation conditions. Analysis revealed that the degradation of pollutants were facilitated by in-situ generation of reactive oxygen and chlorine species during treatment. Further, the procedure employed with molecular hydrogen generation during anodic oxidation as useful byproduct. Thus, the findings suggest that novel mixed metal oxide exhibits high efficacy for AHU treatment, offering a prominent concept for onsite treatment of complex mixed wastewater in real-life applications.

TI Boosting the lattice oxygen activity of Fe-catalyst for producing
   2,5-difor-mylfuran from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
SO FUEL
AB In this work, a novel bimetallic catalyst FeCu@CN was built by calcination of a Fe-Cu/cellulosic polymer framework precursor, which can be observed as FeCuOx nanoparticles well distributed on biochar. The as-synthesized FeCu@CN showed outstanding catalytic performance for producing 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) via selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which showed better performance compared to Fe-based catalysts once reported. With high TOF of 19.62 h(1) for the formation of DFF by using FeCu@CN, 98% of HMF conversion and 95% yield of DFF were effectively obtained using O-2 as the oxidant in acetonitrile. The results and catalyst characterization revealed that the Cu sites and urea modification significantly increased the Fe valence and improved activity of lattice oxygen in the parallelogram carbon frame, thereby reducing the elec-tronic transfer energy to preference Fe-HMF interaction. In this oxidative process, Fe3+ played a pivotal catalytic performace by the redox cycle of Fe2+ and Fe3+, while Cu acted as a co-catalyst to facilitate it by the redox cycle of Cu2+ and Cu+ with Mars-van Krevelen oxidation mechanism.

TI Mechanism and kinetics of electrochemical degradation of uric acid using
   conductive-diamond anodes
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Uric acid (UA) is one of the principal effluents of urine wastewaters, widely used in agriculture as fertilizer, which is potentially dangerous and biorefractory. Hence, the degradation of UA (2,6,8-trihydroxy purine) in aqueous solution of pH 3.0 has been studied by conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation. Hydroxyl radicals formed from water oxidation at the surface of boron-doped diamond anodes were the main oxidizing agents. Effects of current density and supporting electrolyte on the degradation rate and process efficiency are assessed. Results show that the increase of current density from 20 to 60mAcm(-2) leads to a decrease in the efficiency of the electrochemical process. In addition, the best degradation occurred in the presence of NaCl as conductive electrolyte. Interestingly, an almost total mineralization of 50ppm UA was obtained when anodic oxidation was performed at low current densities (20mAcm(-2)) and in the presence of NaCl. This result confirmed that the electrolysis using diamond anodes is a very interesting technology for the treatment of UA. The identification of UA transformation products was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC analysis of treated solutions revealed that oxalic acid and urea were the two intermediates found. Oxalic acid was the most persistent product. Based on detected intermediates and bibliographic research, a mechanism of UA mineralization by anodic oxidation has been proposed. Ionic chromatography analysis confirmed the release of NO3- and NH4+ ions during UA mineralization.

TI Coupling Co-Ni phosphides for energy-saving alkaline seawater splitting
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB The coupling of energy-saving small molecule conversion reactions and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in seawater electrolytes can reduce the energy consumption of seawater electrolysis and mitigate chlorine corrosion issues. However, the fabrication of efficient multifunctional catalysts for this promising technology is of great challenge. Herein, a heterostructured catalyst comprising CoP and Ni2P on nickel foam (CoP/Ni2P@NF) is reported for hydrazine oxidation (HzOR)-assisted alkaline seawater splitting. The coupling of CoP and Ni2P optimizes the electronic structure of the active sites and endows excellent electrocatalytic performance for HzOR and HER. Impressively, the two-electrode HzOR-assisted alkaline seawater splitting (OHzS) cell based on the CoP/Ni2P@NF required only 0.108 V to deliver 100 mA.cm(-2), much lower than 1.695 V for alkaline seawater electrolysis cells. Moreover, the OHzS cell exhibits satisfactory stability over 48 h at a high current density of 500 mA.cm(-2). Furthermore, the CoP/Ni2P@NF heterostructured catalyst also efficiently catalyzed glucose oxidation, methanol oxidation, and urea oxidation in alkaline seawater electrolytes. This work paves a path for high-performance heterostructured catalyst preparation for energy-saving seawater electrolysis for H-2 production.

AB N-deficient g-C3N4 (CNx) photocatalyst was synthesized via a simple one-step thermal polymerization of urea and oxamide for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) under visible-light irradiation in the presence of persulfate (PS) activation. The microstructure and morphology of CNx were investigated by a host of characteristic technologies. The experimental result revealed that CNx/PS system displays a high efficiency in the photocatalytic process of TC degradation. The effects of different environmental factors (catalyst dose, PS dose, initial TC concentration and initial pH) on the degradation of the system were investigated. The possible intermediates products were discussed based on the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Moreover, the toxicity of the TC solution over CNx/PS synergistic photocatalytic system was studied by the culture of bean sprouts, demonstrated that the aquatic toxicity of the TC after degradation of the system was effectively reduced.

TI Electrochemical incineration of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin in sulfate
   medium and synthetic urine matrix
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The degradation of 100 mL of 0.245 mM of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin in 0.05 M Na2SO4 at pH 3.0 has been studied by electrochemical oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (EO-H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF), UVA photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) and solar PEF (SPEF). Electrolyses were performed with a stirred tank reactor using either a boron-doped diamond (BDD) or Pt anode and an air-diffusion cathode. In EF, PEF and SPEF, ciprofloxacin was rapidly removed due to its oxidation with (OH)-O-center dot formed from Fenton's reaction between added Fe2+ and H2O2 generated at the cathode. The larger electrochemical incineration of the antibiotic was achieved by SPEF with BDD with 95% mineralization thanks to the additional attack by hydroxyl radicals formed from water oxidation at the BUD anode surface and the photolysis of final Fe(III)-oxalate and Fe(III)-oxamate species from sunlight. Up to 10 primary intermediates and 11 hydroxylated derivatives were identified by LC-MS, allowing the proposal of a reaction sequence for ciprofloxacin mineralization. A different behavior was found when the same antibiotic concentration was oxidized in a synthetic urine matrix with high urea content and a mixture of PO43-, SO42- and Cl- ions. Since Fenton's reaction was inhibited in this medium, only EO and EO-H2O2 processes were useful for mineralization, being the organics mainly degraded by HClO formed from Cl- oxidation. The EO process with a BDD/stainless steel cell was found to be the most powerful treatment for the urine solution, yielding 96% ciprofloxacin removal and 98% mineralization after 360 min of electrolysis at optimum values of pH 3.0 and current density of 66.6 mA cm(-2). The evolution of released inorganic ions was followed by ion chromatography. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work uses thermal polymerization of urea nitrate, oxyacetic acid and urea as the raw material to prepare ultra-thin porous carbon nitride with carbon defects and C-O band (OA-UN-CN). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed OA-UN-CN had narrower band gap, faster electron transport and a new internal construction electric field. Additionally, the prepared OA-UN-CN significantly enhanced photocatalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) due to enhanced light absorption performance and faster electron overflow. As the result, the OA-UN-CN/PMS could entirely degrade bisphenol A (BPA) within 30 min, where the photodegradation rate was 81.8 and 7.9 times higher than that of g-C3N4 and OA-UN-CN, respectively. Beyond, the OA-UN-CN/PMS could likewise degrade other bisphenol pollutants and sodium lignosulfonate efficiently. We suggested possible photocatalytic degradation pathways accordingly and explored the toxicity of its degradation products. This work provides a new idea on the development of advanced photocatalytic oxidation processes for the treatment of bisphenol pollutants and lignin derivatives, via a metal-free photothermal-catalyst.

TI Design, synthesis and application of a magnetic H-bond catalyst in the
   preparation of new nicotinonitriles via cooperative vinylogous
   anomeric-based oxidation
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Herein, we designed and synthesized a new H-bond magnetic catalyst with 2-tosyl-N-(3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)hydrazine-1-carboxamide as a sensitive H-bond donor/acceptor. We created an organic structure with a urea moiety on the magnetic nanoparticles, which can function as a hydrogen bond catalyst. Hydrogen bond catalysts serve as multi-donor/-acceptor sites. Additionally, we utilized magnetic nanoparticles in the production of the target catalyst, giving it the ability to be recycled and easily separated from the reaction medium with an external magnet. We evaluated the catalytic application of Fe3O4@SiO2@tosyl-carboxamide as a new magnetic H-bond catalyst in the synthesis of new nicotinonitrile compounds through a multicomponent reaction under solvent-free and green conditions with high yields (50-73%). We confirmed the structure of Fe3O4@SiO2@tosyl-carboxamide using various techniques. In addition, the structures of the desired nicotinonitriles were confirmed using melting point, H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR and HR-mass spectrometry analysis. The final step of the reaction mechanism was preceded via cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation (CVABO).

TI Catalytic performance of transition metals (Co, Ni, Zn, Mo) doped
   CuO-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 based catalysts for CO
   preferential oxidation in H2-rich streams
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB CuO-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 composites (CuCZ) doped by transition metals (Co, Ni, Zn, Mo) as well as Co-doped CuCZ with different molar ratios of Co/Cu were prepared by a facile urea grind combustion (UGC) method and applied for CO preferential oxidation (CO-PROX) reaction in the hydrogen-rich gas mixtures. The characterizations of XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption, SEM, TEM, XPS and H-2-TPR were used to investigate the difference in the catalytic behavior. Activity results found that the modification of Co had a positive influence on the catalytic activity of CuCZ and the optimal ratio of Co/Cu was 1/10, while the addition of Ni, Zn and Mo resulted in the decrease in the catalytic activities. XRD, SEM, H-2-TPR and XPS results proved that the catalytic behavior of CuCZ based catalysts largely depended on the properties and types of transition metals. The addition of Co into CuCZ led to the isomorphous substitution of Cu2+ and Ce3+ species via Co2+ and Co3+, and the redispersion of Cu species over CeO2 support promoted the generation of the highly dispersed Cu oxides. As a result, large amount of active Cu+ sites and the surface active oxygen were available. The negative effects caused by Ni, Zn and Mo species were originated from the decreased amount of highly dispersed Cu oxides, possibly due to the differences in the oxidation-reduction property, the ion radius, the metal-support interaction as well as the nucleation rate and the size growth of particles during the preparation process. Consequently, the structure-property relationship was established, and the catalytic activity was suggested to be correlated with the amount of highly dispersed Cu oxides. Furthermore, 1/10Co-CuCZ showed excellent stability in terms of both CO conversion and CO2 selectivity during 120 h time-on-stream test. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Revealing the Electro-oxidation Mechanism of 5-Aminotetrazole on
   Nickel-Based Oxides and Synthesizing 5,5′-Azotetrazolate Salts
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB With the gradual expansion of the application of organic electromechanical synthesis in the field of energetic materials, it is necessary to explore deeply the mechanisms behind the organic electromechanical oxidation of energetic materials in order to develop efficient electrocatalysts. Electrochemical synthesis of 5,5 '-azotetrazolate (ZT) salts is not only environmentally friendly and efficient but also can replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) combined with hydrogen production, significantly reducing the battery voltage of overall water splitting (OWS) and achieving low energy consumption hydrogen production. Here, we prepared the Co-modified nickel-based oxide electrodes (Ni3-xCoO4/carbon cloth (CC), x = 1, 2) as a medium to reveal the oxidative coupling mechanism of 5-aminotetrazole (5-AT). Experimental and theoretical calculations verified that Ni-catalyzed oxidative coupling of 5-AT is a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, including electron transfer of electrocatalytic intermediates (Ni2+-O + OH- = Ni3+-O(OH) + e(-)) and spontaneous dehydrogenation process (Ni3+-O(OH) + X-H = Ni2+-O + X-center dot). The Ni3+-O(OH) is an extremely fast nonreducing electron transfer center that serves as a chemical oxidant to directly abstract hydrogen atoms from the 5-AT. Simultaneously, the synergistic effect of Co doping on the electric cloud around Ni causes the upshift of the d-band centers, which is conducive to the easier adsorption of OH*, forming the generation of active intermediate Ni3+-O(OH). Thus, Ni2CoO4/CC has higher Faraday efficiency (FE) and yield for the oxidation reaction of 5-AT, with a yield of approximately 72.3% after electrolysis at 1.7 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

TI Metabolomic profiles of arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase
   knockout mice: effect of sex and arsenic exposure
SO ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY
AB Arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (As3mt) is the key enzyme in the pathway for methylation of inorganic arsenic (iAs). Altered As3mt expression and AS3MT polymorphism have been linked to changes in iAs metabolism and in susceptibility to iAs toxicity in laboratory models and in humans. As3mt-knockout mice have been used to study the association between iAs metabolism and adverse effects of iAs exposure. However, little is known about systemic changes in metabolism of these mice and how these changes lead to their increased susceptibility to iAs toxicity. Here, we compared plasma and urinary metabolomes of male and female wild-type (WT) and As3mt-KO (KO) C57BL/6 mice and examined metabolomic shifts associated with iAs exposure in drinking water. Surprisingly, exposure to 1 ppm As elicited only small changes in the metabolite profiles of either WT or KO mice. In contrast, comparisons of KO mice with WT mice revealed significant differences in plasma and urinary metabolites associated with lipid (phosphatidylcholines, cytidine, acyl-carnitine), amino acid (hippuric acid, acetylglycine, urea), and carbohydrate (l-sorbose, galactonic acid, gluconic acid) metabolism. Notably, most of these differences were sex specific. Sex-specific differences were also found between WT and KO mice in plasma triglyceride and lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Some of the differentially changed metabolites (phosphatidylcholines, carnosine, and sarcosine) are substrates or products of reactions catalyzed by other methyltransferases. These results suggest that As3mt KO alters major metabolic pathways in a sex-specific manner, independent of iAs treatment, and that As3mt may be involved in other cellular processes beyond iAs methylation.

TI Effect of rice-straw biochar on nitrous oxide emissions from paddy soils
   under elevated CO2 and temperature
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In paddy ecosystems, the feedback of N2O emissions on climate change as well as the effects of biochar on N2O emissions will have a profound impact on global warming and rice production. In order to investigate the effect of biochar amendment on N2O emissions from paddy soils under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (700 ppm) and air temperature (ambient +3 degrees C), a microcosm study was performed in plant growth chambers with rice plant and rice-straw-derived biochar. N2O emissions from urea-fertilized paddy soils had a significant increase with the biochar amendment during midseason drainage under ambient CO2 concentration and air temperature. However, N2O emissions was suppressed under simultaneous elevated CO2 concentration and air temperature, regardless of whether biochar was amended; under this condition the stimulating effect of biochar was attenuated. Reduced mineral N concentrations and increased DOC concentrations could inhibit N2O emission at simultaneously elevated CO2 concentration and air temperature. Increased soil pH and variation in the abundance of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes indicated that biochar amendment could stimulate ammonia oxidation-induced N2O emission during nitrification. Moreover, the liming effect of biochar was lessened under elevated CO2 concentration and temperature, which may contribute to the attenuated stimulating effect of biochar on N2O emissions. More attention should to be paid to the effect of soil pH-induced changes in ammonia oxidation, when mitigating N2O emissions in urea-fertilized paddy soils with biochar amendment at elevated CO2 concentrations and air temperatures.

   (cu@GO-g-CNTO-amine/PCA) on copper pieces
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB In this study, nanocomposite coating of encapsulated copper is developed among the branches of carbon nanostructures (graphene oxide graft and carbon nanotube oxide (GO-g-CNTO)) functionalized with poly citric acid and urea on copper electrode by electrodeposition method. Increasing the percentage of Cu@GO-g-CNTOamine/PCA nanocomposite in the electrolyte affected the surface morphology and improved the granularity of the coated copper particles. The uniform distribution of particles on the surface increased the electrical properties, current density, strength, and other properties because the improvement of the structural factors controls the mechanical behavior of the parts. The structure of the coatings and their performance were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray energy diffraction spectroscopy (EDX), and Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results show that by modifying the surface of carbon nanostructures with poly citric acid and urea, in addition to increasing their solubility, the thickness of the copper coating can be controlled. The use of urea in the reaction reduced the corrosion and oxidation of the surface and increased the electrical and mechanical properties of the surface.

TI Enhancing activity and non-deactivating stability on N-modified
   TiO2 catalyst for visible-light photocatalytic oxidation of
   ammonia at room temperature
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Nitrogen modified TiO2 catalysts (N-TiO2(1)) with high photocatalytic activity and non-deactivating stability were prepared by using urea as nitrogen source. Its efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of NH3 (NH3-PCO) remained above 80 %, peaking at 88 % at room temperature over 72 h, while N2 selectivity also improved noticeably, stabilizing at approximately 87.1 %. Conversely, the NH3 conversion on pure TiO2 plateaued at approximately 67 % within 72 h, peaking at only 72.8 %, with nitrogen selectivity not exceeding 55 %. N element was successfully doped into TiO2 lattice system in the form of O-Ti-N, which reduced the band gap energy from 3.18 eV to 3.07 eV and improved the light utilization rate. The water molecules formed during the reaction contribute to the in-situ reaction to continually generate hydroxyl radicals (& sdot;OH), thereby conferring greater reaction stability. By-products NOx- and NOx are formed during the reaction process, while NOx will be also converted to N2 by initial selective catalytic reduction (i-SCR) mechanism. These findings present a novel perspective for enhancing the stability of NH3-PCO active agents and have substantial applications within the parameters of air pollution control.

AB The emission of particulate matter (PM) and NOx from diesel engines has proven to have a negative influence on health, and future regulations will require more than 90% PM and NOx removal. For land-based trucks using low-sulfur fuels, a sequential catalyst system is foreseen consisting of an upstream diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), a catalyzed diesel particulate filter (cDPF), and a downstream SCR NOx removal catalyst together with an ammonia slip catalyst (ASC). Urea is injected as a precursor for ammonia: engine -> DOC -> cDPF -> Urea(inj) -> SCR -> ASC -> out. The SCR function can with process advantage be integrated into the filter and reduce volume. The trapped soot in the cDPF must currently be combusted away. Three different soot combustion mechanisms are used: (1) passive soot regeneration by NO2, (2) combustion by direct catalyst soot contact, and (3) active soot regeneration with O-2 at around 600 degrees C. Full soot combustion by direct catalyst soot contact is not needed in a system as soot combustion by NO2 and O-2 gases plays major roles. For marine vessels, no PM emission regulation exists today. The emission problem is especially severe for vessels using heavy-fuel oil (HFO) with up to 3.5% sulfur and high (heavy) metal content, fuel properties that until now have prevented a reliable PM removal process. Recently, however, a catalyst-assisted passive soot regeneration process above 350 degrees C was developed including an "in situ" ash removal. This new process was validated on a ship using a sulfur-resistant Pd,V2O5 filter catalyst that combusts soot, CO, and HC including PAHs, and it is well suited as front end for an SOx scrubber.

TI Binary copper-manganese based catalysts with urea for low-temperature
   selective catalytic reduction of NO: Performance, characterization and

SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The NO emission reduction for low-temperature flue gas is still a serious challenge, low-temperature selective catalytic reduction with urea (LTU-SCR) is a new and promising approach for removing NO at low temperatures (50-100 degrees C), which can avert the ammonia escape of the conventional SCR method. In this work, a series of binary catalysts were prepared and used for LTU-SCR, the carrier and catalysts were characterized in detail by EA, BET, FESEM, EDS, XRD, XPS, AAS, TPD, FT-IR and TGA. The results of catalytic activity tests showed that the binary catalysts exhibited better performance than the unary catalysts. When the calcination temperature is 500 degrees C and the mass ratio of CuOx to MnOx is 5:5, the binary Cu-Mn/NUAC catalyst had the highest catalytic activity. Moreover, the performance of the binary catalyst increased with the increasing reaction temperature, and the binary Cu0.5Mn0.5/NUAC catalyst could achieve 100% NO conversion at 100 degrees C. Finally, based on the results of NO transient responses, characterization experiments and thermodynamic analyses, the NO conversion mechanism on the binary Cu0.5Mn0.5/NUAC catalyst was proposed and discussed systematically; the synergetic effect between copper and manganese on the binary catalyst was attributed to the electron transfer of Cu2+ + Mn2+ reversible arrow Cu-0 + Mn4+.

TI Synthesis and textural evolution of mesoporous
   Si3N4 aerogel with high specific surface area and
   excellent thermal insulation property via the urea assisted sol-gel
   technique
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Si3N4 aerogel, which is one of the most promising materials for application as high-temperature thermal insulation, is synthesized by the urea-assisted sol-gel technique, followed by the supercritical drying, carbonization, carbothermal reduction and carbon combustion processes. The effects of heat treatment temperatures on the physicochemical and textural evolution of mesoporous Si3N4 aerogel are investigated. Si3N4 aerogel is formed when the heat treatment temperature increases to 1500 degrees C, whereas it transforms into SiC phase with a further higher temperature of 1600 degrees C. The SEM analysis confirms the existence of Si3N4 nanoparticles, and the particle size of Si3N4 nanoparticles is around 20-40 nm, with pore size around 20-40 nm. The XPS measurement reveals that Si3N4 aerogel is composed of 74.4% Si3N4 phase, with lower content of 25.6% SiO2. codoped aerogel possesses a large BET specific surface area of 519.6 m(2)/g, which results from the mesoporous pores left after carbon combustion. This value is much larger than that of the conventional Si3N4 porous ceramics and Si3N4 nano materials ever reported. The BJH adsorption average pore diameter of Si3N4 aerogel is around 11.8 nm, with a large pore volume of 3.5 cm(3)/g. Si3N4 oxidation with forming amorphous SiO2 layer on the surface is observed by the TG measurement. Moreover, the resulting Si3N4 aerogel shows low bulk density of 0.075 g/cm(3), as well as low thermal conductivity of 0.045 W/(m.K) at room temperature. The mechanism of Si3N4 formation is based on the VS growth between C, SiO2 and N-2. The structures evolution and formation mechanism of Si3N4 aerogel are also investigated in this study.

   using different precursors
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Graphitic-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalyst was synthesized by a facile chemical pyrolysis method, which was built on the self-condensation of different precursors to generate g-C3N4, e.g., melamine, urea, and thiocarbamide. And the different precursors produced a great influence on the photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4. Heterojunctions of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 were synthesized using a facile solvent evaporation method. The formation of BiVO4/g-C3N4 composites were confirmed by XRD, FT-IR, SEM, XPS, and UV-Vis DRS. The photocatalytic activities for RhB degradation were evaluated under visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 prepared by urea was higher than that of g-C3N4 prepared by melamine and thiocarbamide, which was attributed to its favorable dispersibility, larger specific surface area, and higher oxidation capacity. The heterojunction composites exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than pure g-C3N4 or BiVO4. The results showed obvious removal efficiency for RhB, and the optimal sample with a BiVO4 content of 10% exhibited higher efficiency than pure g-C3N4 and BiVO4, and 10wt%BiVO4/CN-U showed the highest photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of BiVO4/g-C3N4 composite can be attributed to the intimate coupling between the two host substrates, resulting in an efficient charge separation.

TI Nickel hydroxide array coated with NiFe alloy nanosheets for overall
   mixed water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In this study, Ni(OH)(2) coated NiFe alloy with Mott-Schottky structure is successfully prepared by hydro-thermal and in-situ electrodeposition methods. The materials are characterized by physical and electro-chemical characterizations, and the results show that Ni(OH)(2) @NiFe/NF has better catalytic activities than other monomers. Furthermore, the Ni/Fe ratio in the electrodeposition step and the CV deposition cycles could affect the performances. While the sample with Ni/Fe= 2:2 and 60 CV deposition cycles (Ni(OH)(2) @ Ni2Fe2/NF-60) exhibits the best activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution re-action (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Furthermore, the two-electrode electrolyzer composed of Ni (OH)(2) @Ni2Fe2/NF-60 exhibits the smallest driving potential (1.696 V (HER & OER) and 1.601 V (HER & UOR) at 50 mA.cm(-2)), with excellent stability. These may be due to the Mott-Schottky structure (metal-semiconductor interface) could reduce the binding energy of hydrogen atoms, promote charge transfer and generate abundant active sites, while producing a synergistic effect and promoting electrocatalytic reactions.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Photoelectro-catalytic oxidation of monoethanolamine: From the study of
   electrooxidation mechanism to the development of high-efficient Ni-based
   photoelectro-catalysts
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Monoethanolamine (MEA) electrooxidation occurring on Ni catalyst has proven to be a viable tactics for simultaneous MEA degradation and energy recovery. However, the excessively large overpotential (1505 mV) on Ni catalyst either causes high electricity consumption when acquiring H2 from MEA-containing electrolyzer or leads to low energy output when extracting electricity from direct MEA fuel cell. In this context, the reaction mechanism of MEA electrooxidation on Ni-based catalyst is deciphered at first by employing a specially designed three-step electrochemical procedure and in-situ Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical data deconvolutions indicate the indirect electrochemical-chemical reaction path, via Ni(OH)2/NiOOH mediator, occupies-2.5 % of the total catalytic current density at 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl and the direct oxidation of MEA ranks the rest-97.5 %. To decrease the onset potential of MEA oxidation, a photoelectric-catalytic system including high-efficient Nibased photoelectric-catalyst, where Ni is intimately coated on TiO2 by in-situ photodeposition to achieve the shortest carrier transport channel between Ni(OH)2 and TiO2, is developed. Results show the overpotential of MEA electrooxidation under illumination significantly drops to 255 mV. Such a Ni@TiO2/FTO electrode also exerts excellent durability toward MEA oxidation.

TI Photocatalysis over N-Doped TiO2 Driven by Visible Light for
   Pb(II) Removal from Aqueous Media
SO CATALYSTS
AB The photocatalysis process over N-doped TiO2 under visible light is examined for Pb(II) removal. The doping TiO2 with N element was conducted by simple hydrothermal technique and using urea as the N source. The doped photocatalysts were characterized by DRUVS, XRD, FTIR and SEM-EDX instruments. Photocatalysis of Pb(II) through a batch experiment was performed for evaluation of the doped TiO2 activity under visible light, with applying various fractions of N-doped, photocatalyst mass, irradiation time, and solution pH. The research results attributed that N doping has been successfully performed, which shifted TiO2 absorption into visible region, allowing it to be active under visible irradiation. The photocatalytic removal of Pb(II) proceeded through photo-oxidation to form PbO2. Doping N into TiO2 noticeably enhanced the photo-catalytic oxidation of Pb(II) under visible light irradiation. The highest photocatalytic oxidation of 15 mg/L Pb(II) in 25 mL of the solution could be reached by employing TiO2 doped with 10%w of N content 15 mg, 30 min of time and at pH 8. The doped-photocatalyst that was three times repeatedly used demonstrated significant activity. The most effective process of Pb(II) photo-oxidation under beneficial condition, producing less toxic and handleable PbO2 and good repeatable photocatalyst, suggest a feasible method for Pb(II) remediation on an industrial scale.

TI Porous defective carbon nitride obtained by a universal method for
   photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB For the first time, herein this work, we have developed an effective and adaptable method to introduce defects onto the polymeric carbon nitride by simply grinding urea with urea nitrate which resulting new carbon nitride composite (UNU-C3N4) and melamine with urea nitrate which resulting new carbon nitride composite (UNM-C3N4). The UNU-C3N4 reveals high performance towards photocatalytic hydrogen production and as well as photocatalytic removal of contaminants. The results confirm that the defects enhanced the specific surface area, and improved performance of adsorbed oxygen which beneficial to generate more active radicals and more conducive sties to improve d the overall photocatalytic performance. The high N, H, and O content-enhanced electron polarization effects, by introducing the additional N, H, and O atoms into the g-C3N4 matrix, which will increase the charge transfer rate and charge separation efficiency. At the same time, the results of ESR also expression that the new type of as-prepared carbon nitride samples exhibit abundant of hydrogen radical (H center dot) formation, which is also assist to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. As expected, the H-2 evolution rate of UNU-C3N4 (or UNM-C3N4) underneath simulated solar light irradiation is 9.93 times (13.76 times) than that of U-C3N4 (urea as raw material) (or M-C3N4 (melamine as raw material)). The high hydrogen evolution rates of UNU-C3N4 and UNM-C3N4 are 830.94 and 556.79 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under the visible-light irradiation, respectively. Meanwhile, the synthesized UNU-C3N4 and UNM-C3N4 material are demonstrated an efficient ability to degrade pollutants. In general, this work provides a viable way to introduce defects and hydrogen bands into the structure of carbon nitride. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid by palladium nanoparticles
   electrochemically synthesized from a deep eutectic solvent
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB Palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) were formed and supported onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) from a single potentiostatic step using palladium chloride (PdCl2) as the precursor salt, dissolved in a deep eutectic mixture formed by 2-Hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium chloride (choline chloride) and diaminomethanal (urea). Analysis of the potentiostatic current density transients allows to accurately establish the amount of Pd deposited on the GCE surface required to determine the so-called mass activity, as defined by the ratio between methanoic acid (formic acid) oxidation current and palladium mass electrodeposited on the electrode. From SEM analysis of the GCE surface modified with PdNPs, it was found that PdNPs were distributed uniformly over the electrode surface, having an average size of (60 +/- 9) nm. EDX and XPS analysis confirm a core-shell morphology constituted by a Pd core surrounded by a palladium (II) Hydroxide- palladium (II) oxide (Pd(OH)(2)-PdO) shell. The GCE modified with PdNPs (GCE/PdNPs) were used to oxidize formic acid from aqueous electrolytic baths added with perchloric acid (HClO4) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). It was shown that the maximum mass activity depended on both, the nature of the electrolytic bath and the applied potential for the PdNPs electrodeposition. However, the best mass activity ((5085 +/- 129) mA mgPd(-1)) was achieved with the GCE/PdNPs, formed at -700 mV vs. the silver quasi reference electrode (Ag QRE), immersed in the HClO4 electrolytic bath, even when the formic acid concentration was half that used in the H2SO4 electrolytic bath. Furthermore, the mass activities of the PdNPs reported in this work rank high among other values reported in the literature for nanoparticles based on palladium but synthesized with more complex and expensive processes, having the advantage of being obtained by a simple, rapid, and cost-effective electrochemical method.

TI In-situ Fe-O co-doped carbon nitride heterogenous catalyst for enhanced
   photo-Fenton oxidation performance towards recalcitrant organic
   pollutants
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB One-step and in-situ FeCl3-participated 3-participated molten urea thermal polymerization strategy is designed to prepare Fe-O co-doped carbon nitride photo-Fenton catalyst (Fe/OCN). Fe/OCN exhibits remarkable photo-Fenton catalytic oxidation capacity towards recalcitrant organic pollutants, in which 0.31 wt% Fe/OCN with optimal Fe-doping level exhibits significantly 60 and 6.3 times higher pseudo-first-order kinetic constant than single photocatalysis and Fenton system in the degradation of methyl orange. The enhancement of photo-Fenton catalytic performance is mainly ascribed to the realization of ideal Fe-O and Fe-N coordination structure in the framework of polymeric carbon nitride, which can not only serve as prime sites for the adsorption of target pollutants molecules and transfer channels for directed migration of photogenerated charges, but also well-modulate electronic structure and band structure of Fe/OCN. Accordingly, the resulting boosted charge carriers separation and transfer dynamics and increased electron density around Fe active centers facilitate -Fe(II) regeneration and H2O2 2 O 2 activation, leading to the significant production of plentiful reactive species responsible for degradation and mineralization of organic pollutants. The present work provides new insight into the optimized design and precise regulation of carbon nitride-based photo-Fenton system for advanced wastewater treatment.

TI Enhanced Efficiency of Novel Green and Urea Mediated
   CuCo2O4 Nanocomposites for Acetaminophen Drug
   Loading, Accessible Catalytic Reduction of Nitro Compounds and
   Adsorption of Pesticides
SO JOURNAL OF INORGANIC AND ORGANOMETALLIC POLYMERS AND MATERIALS
AB Researchers are focussing on creating sustainable environment by reducing the production and consumption of materials. The catalysis is not an exception, so there is always need for a catalyst that can perform multiple applications. Here, (Carica Papaya) and urea mediated CuCo2O4 nanocomposite was synthesized using simple co-precipitation method to perform drug loading, reduction of nitrocompounds and adsorption of pesticides. The prepared plant mediated CuCo2O4 (CCP) and urea mediated CuCo2O4 (CCU) was characterized using analytical techniques like XRD, UV-Vis, FT-IR, SEM-EDAX, TEM and DLS studies etc. The XRD patterns of CCP and CCU were indexed to the cubic spinal structure with the crystallite size of 11.9 and 27.6 nm by calculated using Scherrer's equation. The typical FT-IR spectra of CCP and CCU composites exhibited two extremely strong vibration peaks at the range of 658 - 657 and 540-545 cm(- 1) due to the presence of the Co-O and Cu-O bond vibrations respectively. The band gap values (E-g) were found to be 1.3 and 1.5 eV and thermal stability of the prepared CuCo2O4 was analyzed using thermogravimetric studies. The SEM images confirmed the spherical morphology with the particle size of 89.9 and 107 nm respectively. The catalytic efficiency was analyzed by using acetaminophen as a sample drug for finding the loading efficiency of CCP and CCU found to be linear with time of loading had good R-2 values of 0.93 and 0.91 respectively. The drug loading efficiency or entrapment efficiency of the CCP and CCU was found to be 72.8 and 85.2% after 48 h of drug loading respectively. The catalyst weight dependant activity of CCP and CCU in the reduction of 2-nitrophenol and 2-nitroaniline effectively witnessed the ability of CCP and CCU over other catalysts. Furthermore, CCP and CCU were used as the adsorbents and made to adsorb the real time agricultural pesticide like pendimethalin for a period of 130 min and the obtained cumulative data suggested the superiority of CCP over CCU in the above catalytic applications.

TI Effect of Cow Urine Nitrogen Rates and Moisture Conditions on Nitrogen
   Mineralization in Andisol from Southern Chile
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Urea present in cattle urine contributes large amounts of nitrogen (N) to grazed pastures, which can be the equivalent to approximately 1000 kg N ha(-1). However, there are no studies in volcanic soils of southern Chile on the effect of different concentrations of urinary N deposited in the soil, nor of the effect different wetting and drying conditions mimicking the variation in weather conditions on the nitrification process from urea to NH4+ and total oxidized nitrogen (TON) over time. In addition, the inhibition of nitrification driven by the accumulation of NH3 at high rates of N applied to Andisol has not been evaluated. Fresh cattle urine was applied at three different rates of N equivalent to 247 kg N ha(-1) (Low N), 461 kg N ha(-1) (Medium N), and 921 kg N ha(-1) (High N), as well as deionized water as a control. Further, three moisture conditions were imposed: constant moisture (CM), drying-rewetting (DRW) cycles at 7-day intervals, and soil drying (SD). Destructive soil core samples were evaluated for top and bottom halves individually every 7 days over a 36-day period to measure changes on inorganic N and pH. There were no interaction effects for N rates and soil moisture. The main effect of the different rates of N on mineralization was significant throughout the incubation period, while the effect of the different moisture conditions was variable over time. High N was associated with elevated NH3 concentrations and could explain why total N mineralization was partially inhibited. These results suggest that the presence of different nitrifying microorganisms in soil under different chemical and physical conditions determines nitrification, and thus, the oxidation of ammonia should be studied in more detail as the first step of nitrification, specifically in volcanic soils.

Boric acid and urea were used as boron source and nitrogen source separately and the nitridation process was carried out at 850 degrees C for 4h under the protection of N-2. Dipping times were considered as variables to find out optimum amounts. The structure, chemical composition, phase and properties of BN coated carbon fibers were characterized. Results showed that continuous and uniform coatings were prepared after three times dipping and adhered well with carbon fibers. The coatings were mainly composed of the phase of t-BN. The oxidation property and high temperature resistant performance of the BN modified carbon fibers were greatly improved.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB In this research, ultrasonic synthesis is applied for the fabrication of a novel catalyst, based on immobilization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on thiourea functionalized magnetic hydroxyapatite. A recoverable Ag nano-catalyst is constructed by decoration of AgNPs on the surface of thiourea modified magnetic hydroxyapatite. Magnetic hydroxyapatite is used as an organic-inorganic hybrid support for the catalyst. The organic-inorganic hybrid support is prepared by co-precipitation, followed by its surface modification through covalent functionalization of 1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-propyl)thiourea. The fabricated catalyst has been characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The nanoparticles are mostly tubular in shape and their particle sizes are smaller than 100 nm. This nanocatalyst shows efficient and robust catalytic activity in different reactions, including selective reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4NP) and oxidation of primary amines by applying NaBH4 and urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) as reagents, respectively. The catalyst shows good reusability in 10 sequential reaction runs.

TI Identifying And Unveiling the Role of Multivalent Metal States for
   Bidirectional UOR and HER Over Ni, Mo-Trithiocyanuric Based Coordination
   Polymer
SO SMALL
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR), an ideal alternative to oxygen evolution reaction (OER), has received increasing attention for realizing energy-saving H-2 production and relieving pollutant degradation. Normally, most studied Ni-based UOR catalysts pre-oxidate to NiOOH and then act as active sites. However, the unpredictable transformation of the catalyst's structure and its dissolution and leaching, may complicate the accuracy of mechanism studies and limit its further applications. Herein, a novel self-supported bimetallic Mo-Ni-C3N3S3 coordination polymers (Mo-NT@NF) with strong metal-ligand interactions and different H2O/urea adsorption energy are prepared, which realize a bidirectional UOR/hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reaction pathway. A series of Mo-NT@NF is prepared through a one-step mild solvothermal method and their multivalent metal states and HER/UOR performance relationship is evaluated. Combining catalytic kinetics, in situ electrochemical spectroscopic characterization, and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, a bidirectional catalytic pathway is proposed by N, S-anchored Mo5+ and reconstruction-free Ni3+ sites for catalytic active center of HER and UOR, respectively. The effective anchoring of the metal sites and the fast transfer of the intermediate H* by N and S in the ligand C3N3S3H3 further contribute to the fast kinetic catalysis. Ultimately, the coupled HER||UOR system with Mo-NT@NF as the electrodes can achieve energy-efficient overall-urea electrolysis for H-2 production.

TI Bimetallic Pd-Fe Supported on Nitrogen-Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide as
   Electrocatalyst for Formic Acid Oxidation
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB This study was conducted to exploit the properties of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) as support material for formic acid fuel cell. Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide was synthesized by the hydrothermal synthesis method using graphene oxide (GO) flakes and urea as a nitrogen source. Palladium and iron with controllable atomic ratio were used as the active metals. Graphene oxide and carbon nanotube-supported PdFe nanoparticles were synthesized for comparison. The structure, morphology, and chemical composition of the synthesized catalysts were ascertained by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The average particle sizes for Pd3Fe/N-rGO and Pd/N-rGO were 4.65 and 3.95 nm, respectively. The electrochemical characterizations (CO stripping, cyclic voltammetry, and chronoamperometry) showed that the Pd3Fe/N-rGO electrocatalyst had higher electrocatalytic activity and stability compared with that of Pd3Fe/rGO and Pd3Fe/CNT. The mass activity of Pd3Fe/N-rGO in 0.5 M of HCOOH and 0.5 M of H2SO4 solutions was 1463.9 mAmg(-1) Pd, which was 3.3 and 1.35 times that of the activity obtained with graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes with the same composition, respectively. The superior performance of the Pd3Fe/N-rGO catalyst was ascribed to the presence of nitrogen functionalities in the nitrogen-doped reduced GO and the synergistic interaction between Pd and Fe nanoparticles. Nitrogen-doped reduced GO promoted the formation of smaller and narrowly distributed nanoparticles and exerted favorable electronic effects because of electron transfer from N to Pd. Therefore, Pd3Fe/N-rGO can serve as a potential electrocatalyst for the oxidation of formic acid.

TI Novel electrocatalysts for ethylene glycol oxidation based on
   functionalized phosphates of bimetals Mn/Ni: Morphology, crystallinity,
   and electrocatalytic performance
SO SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB Novel bimetallic phosphates of Mn&Ni were investigated in this study as low-cost phosphate electrodes for ethylene glycol (EG) electrooxidation at high pH (2.0 M NaOH aqueous medium). The investigated electro-catalyst was chemically prepared by two preparation methods: reflux (MnNiPh-Re) and sol-gel (MnNiPh-SG). The as-designed MnNiPh-Re and MnNiPh-SG materials were physiochemically investigated by different techniques to describe the morphology and the impact of the preparation method on its morphology besides crystallinity and chemistry. Interestingly, the preparation method significantly affects the observed morphology. In the case of the sol-gel method, the MnNiPh-SG material has nanocubes characteristics with heterogeneous orientation and ex-hibits micro sheets in case of reflux strategy made up of super-thin sheets having nanoscale in their thickness and connected to create a different thickness sheet. The electrocatalytic performance of MnNiPh-Re and MnNiPh-SG as working electrodes for EG oxidation was investigated in terms of anodic current density and charge transfer resistance. Interestingly, the anodic current density of the suggested phosphate electrode was increased from 0.018 mA/cm2 to 5.73 mA/cm2 because of only introducing EG to the supporting electrolyte. The fabricated MnNiPh-SG has better EG oxidation if compared with MnNiPh-Re at different EG contents from 0.0 M to 1.0 M Additionally, the improvement of the charge transfer resistances and anodic current density confirms the suc-cessful electrocatalytic oxidation of EG over the presented MnNiPh-SG.

TI To meet demand of Euro V emission legislation urea free for HD diesel
   engine with DMCC
SO FUEL
AB Based on European Steady-state Cycle (ESC) test procedure, an engine test was carried out to meet the demand of Euro V legislation with diesel methanol compound combustion (DMCC) technology on a common-rail, turbocharged, inter-cooling heavy-duty and high pressure exhaust gas recirculation (HP-EGR) diesel engine with meeting the requirements of Euro IV legislation. The engine was just modified with DMCC technology and combined with after-treatment device diesel oxidation catalyst coupled with particulate oxidation catalyst (DPOC). The test results show that it can fully meet the demand of Euro V legislation without the help of selected catalyst reduction (SCR). Additionally, the comparative analysis of the dynamic and economic performances between the DMCC Euro V engine and the baseline Euro IV engine was presented in this study. The regulated emissions (included HC, CO, NOX, PM (particulate matter)) and unregulated emissions (included formaldehyde (HCHO) and unburned methanol (CH3OH)) before and after DPOC from DMCC Euro V engine were also investigated. The dynamic performance of DMCC Euro V engine is basically consistent with the baseline Euro IV engine, while there is a slight deterioration in economic performance at certain operation conditions in terms of calorific value. Compared with the baseline engine before DPOC, the DMCC engine causes an increase in HC, CO, HCHO and CH3OH emissions, but the NOX and PM emissions are much better. The DPOC efficiency in the conversion rate of HC, CO, HCHO and CH(3)OHa is over 98% under the whole ESC test procedure, and for PM, the conversion efficiency is only around 21%. However, DPOC has no obvious influence on the conversion of NOX emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Boosting hydrogen generation by anodic oxidation of iodide over
   Ni-Co(OH)2 nanosheet arrays
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB For overall water electrolysis, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is severely limited by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, replacing the OER with a more favorable anodic oxidation reaction with remarkable kinetics is of paramount significance, especially the one that can produce value-added chemicals. Moreover, time-saving and cost-effective strategies for the fabrication of electrodes are helpful for the wide application of electrolysis. Herein, thermodynamically more favorable iodide electrooxidation over Ni doped Co(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays (NSAs) in alkaline solution is presented as the alternative to the OER to boost the HER. And the active species are determined to be the reverse redox of the Co(iv)/Co(iii) couple. Remarkably, a negative shift of voltage of 320 mV is observed at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) after using iodide electrolysis to replace ordinary water splitting. The synthetic strategy and iodide oxidation in this work expand the application of Co-based materials in the field of energy-saving hydrogen production.

TI Synthesis of N-doped graphene nanosheets and its composite with urea
   choline chloride ionic liquid as a novel electrode for supercapacitor
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets are synthesized via one pot electrochemical method using graphite rode in super saturated urea choline chloride and water. GO and ionic liquid are annealed using thermal method to obtain NRGO. Microstructure measurements present that most nitrogen doped on the edge of the surfaces of nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that nitrogen is grafted to the basal plane of graphene, with about 6.2 atom % nitrogen coverage. Nitrogen-doped RGO is evaluated as a supercapacitor electrode. The NRGO in ionic liquid has an exceptionally high capacitance of 383 F g(-1) in 6 M of KOH and two-electrode configuration at current density of 1Ag(-1). In comparison, an analogous NRGO and RGO bear low capacitance of 321 and 196 F g(-1), demonstrating the importance of ionic liquid in the charge storage process. The method is easily scaled from milligram to multigram quantities of N-doped RGO and ionic liquid. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Responses of hybrid sturgeon (Huso dauricus ♀ x Acipenser
   schrenckii ♂) to oral administration of phosphorus
SO AQUACULTURE RESEARCH
AB To better understand the phosphorus (P) utilization in hybrid sturgeon (Huso dauricus female x Acipenser schrenckii male), a combined technique with oesophageal intubation, dorsal aorta cannulation and urinary catheterization was used in the present study. Groups of five hybrid sturgeon were orally administrated with graded doses of P (0, 50, 100 and 200 mg P/kg BW) in the form of monocalcium phosphate. The high dose of P (200 mg P/kg BW) caused a significant increase in plasma P concentration. Plasma calcium (Ca) concentrations were significantly increased in the fish treated with 0 and 100 mg P/kg BW. Both P and urea excretion showed increased changing pattern with increasing P intubation level and exhibited significant higher value in 200 mg P/kg BW group. A significant increase in Ca excretion was found in the group without P supplementation (0 mg P/kg BW). ALP and SOD activity in plasma was inhibited in fish at P-deficient groups (0 and 50 mg P/kg BW). The data in the current study showed that hybrid sturgeon at 100 mg P/kg BW treatment exhibited better P and Ca utilizations with lower waste excretion, as well as favourable status of anti-oxidation.

AB A series of TiO2-based photocatalysts obtained by deposition of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) has been tested in the photocatalytic decomposition of aqueous ammonia under UVA irradiation. Two main deposition routes were employed, i.e. (i) the deposition of surfactant-stabilized preformed metal NPs and (ii) a modified version of the well-known deposition-precipitation technique, employing urea as precipitating agent. The effects that the deposition route and the amount of deposited metal have on both ammonia conversion (X-NH3) and selectivity (Sy) towards the different N-containing products (Y =N-2, NO2-, NO3-) have been investigated systematically, in relation to the morphological distribution of NPs on TiO2, as evidenced by HR-TEM analysis. The combination of Pt (0.8 wt.%) with a relatively low amount of Ru NPs (0.1 wt.%) as co-catalysts, both deposited on TiO2 under optimized conditions, results in an exceptional stabilization of nitrite ions (S-N02 - similar to 70%), from which N-2, the most desired ammonia oxidation product, might subsequently be obtained catalytically.

SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB A Mn2O3 nanorod array has been successfully prepared by using simple pulse-reverse electrodeposition that was then followed by transformation to a higher MnOx oxidation state via electrochemical oxidation. The surface morphology and composition of the MnOx nanorods was verified via scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The MnOx nanorod array exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity toward glucose oxidation under alkaline conditions and these properties were confirmed by using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. The structure of the MnOx nanorod array not only provides a large surface area, but also facilitates electron transfer and mass diffusion. The optimum oxidation time was determined to be 30 min, at which the MnOx glucose sensor demonstrated a sensitivity at 811.8 mu A mM(-1), which is the highest among the various types of MnOx-based sensors that have been reported so far. Moreover, it also exhibited an excellent long-term stability and a good selectivity in the presence of interferents, such as ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid, urea, and aspartic acid. The practical applicability of MnOx sensor was also studied by detecting glucose in human serum, in which it demonstrated an excellent selectivity and reliability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB Boron nitride (BN) coatings were successfully formed on the surface of carbon fibers by the powder immersion reaction method with boric acid and urea as precursor, followed by nitridation at 650 degrees C, 850 degrees C and 1050 degrees C in nitrogen, respectively. The composition, structure, morphology and phase of the samples were characterized in detail and the influence of different temperatures on the quality of BN coatings was systemically investigated. It was observed that the amorphous BN could be obtained at lower temperature, and with the increase of temperature, the amorphous BN gradually transformed into the hexagonal BN(h-BN) with high crystallinity. The coatings obtained on the surface of carbon fibers were continuous without cracking or peeling and combined closely with the substrate. The oxidation resistance of the coated carbon fibers was significantly higher than the uncoated carbon fibers. The coated carbon fibers maintained the tensile strength about 93% of its original strength.

TI Construction of a hierarchically structured, NiCo-Cu-based trifunctional
   electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting and
   5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB In this study, Cu nanowire arrays grown on a three-dimensional Cu foam substrate are modified by nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiCoNSs/Cu-NWs), which can be used as a self-supporting trifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation. This hybrid material as an electrocatalyst possesses remarkable advantages including low cost, freestanding nature, high conductivity and a unique hierarchical structure with a potential bimetallic synergistic effect. The optimized NiCoNSs/Cu-NWs electrode shows excellent HER and OER performances in alkaline solution, making it a remarkable bifunctional electrode for efficient overall water splitting. When assembling a two-electrode electrolytic cell with NiCoNSs/Cu-NWs as both the anode and cathode, it requires an applied cell voltage of only 1.69 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in water electrolysis. Electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is also carried out in 1.0 M KOH. HMF oxidation occurs upon the formation of Ni3+ species, leading to earlier catalytic onset (around 300 mV ahead) in comparison with the OER trigged by the higher-oxidation-state Ni4+ species. When HMF oxidation and H-2 evolution are integrated into a two-electrode electrolyzer with the NiCoNSs/Cu-NWs catalyst couple, the voltage required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 1.44 V, approximately 250 mV lower than that of overall water splitting. The present work provides useful guidance for designing and developing efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for energy-saving hydrogen production coupled with oxidative biomass upgrading.

   Electronics
SO MATERIALS
AB Conductive paper has the advantages of being low-cost, lightweight, disposable, flexible, and foldable, giving it promising potential in future electronics. However, mainstream conductive papers are opaque and rigid, which seriously affect the wide application of conductive paper. In this paper, we demonstrate a highly transparent, flexible, and conductive paper, fabricated by mixing cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) with silver nanowires (AgNWs) and then plasticizing with choline chloride/urea solvent. The as-prepared CNF/AgNW paper showed high transparency (90% transmittance) and flexibility (27% strain), and low sheet resistance (56 /sq). Moreover, the resistance change of CNF/AgNW paper increased only 1.1% after 3000 bending-unbending cycles under a 150 degrees large angle, implying a long working life and stability. In view of this, our methodology has the potential to open a new powerful route for fabrication of paper-based green electronics.

TI Combination of modified nitrogen fertilizers and water saving irrigation
   can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase rice yield
SO GEODERMA
AB The combined impacts of modified nitrogen (N) fertilizers and water saving irrigation (WSI) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and grain yield of rice paddies have not previously been documented. GHG emissions from rice paddies under modified N fertilizers and WSI deserve attention because water and N are being used extensively to attain higher grain yield. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of modified N fertilizers and WSI on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and grain yield in rice paddies. Four treatments were applied: urea with conventional irrigation (U + CI), urea with shallow water depth with alternate wetting drying water saving irrigation (U + SWD), polymer -coated controlled release urea with SWD (CRU + SWD), and nitrapyrin-urea composition plus hydroquinone with SWD (NU + HQ + SWD). Compared to U + CI, CH4 emissions significantly decreased by 26% and 31%, and N2O emissions increased by 52% and 42% under U + SWD in the early and late rice growing seasons respectively (p < 0.05). Although SWD increased N2O emissions, total GHG emissions (T-GHG) reduced by 20% and 25% in the two rice seasons under U + SWD, and GHG emission intensity (GHGI) decreased by 24% on average. Modified N fertilizer applications also affected grain yield and GHG emissions under SWD. Compared with U + SWD, CRU + SWD and NU + HQ + SWD reduced CH4, N2O emissions and TGHG by 28-49%, 12-44% and 26-45%, respectively, while grain yield increased by 6-35%. Reduction in CH4 emissions occurred because, compared to urea, CRU and NU + HQ can inhibit CH4 production and transport by controlling development of invalid tillers, while their nitrogen release patterns were more favorable for CH4 consumption. In summary, modified N fertilizers in combination with SWD are a win -win strategy to improve grain production while reducing GHG emissions in the rice cropping system.

TI Alternatives to Water Photooxidation for Photoelectrochemical Solar
   Energy Conversion and Green H2 Production
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is considered a promising technology to produce renewable hydrogen, a clean fuel or energy carrier to replace conventional carbon-based fossil-fuel sources. Nevertheless, the overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency and the cost-effectiveness of this technology are still unsatisfactory for practical implementation. This can be primarily attributed to the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the relatively low economic value of cogenerated O-2 production. Over the past decades, there are extensive efforts to explore more kinetically favorable photooxidation reactions, which coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can simultaneously improve H-2 production yield and produce higher valuable alternatives to conventional O-2. This review aims to present recent progress on the alternative anodic choices to OER. Here, the fundamental of PEC water splitting and the critical components required for this system are first shortly summarized. Then the benefits and issues of alternative photooxidation reactions including photooxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide, chlorine, alcohol, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, or urea oxidation when combined with the concurrent HER, are reviewed and analyzed. This review is concluded by presenting a critical evaluation of the challenges and opportunities of these alternative HER-coupled photooxidation reactions for solar energy production and environmental treatment.

TI Thaumarchaeal ecotype distributions across the equatorial Pacific Ocean
   and their potential roles in nitrification and sinking flux attenuation
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Thaumarchaea are among the most abundant microbial groups in the ocean, but controls on their abundance and the distribution and metabolic potential of different subpopulations are poorly constrained. Here, two ecotypes of ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaea were quantified using ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The shallow, or water column "A" (WCA), ecotype was the most abundant ecotype at the depths of maximum nitrification rates, and its abundance correlated with other biogeochemical indicators of remineralization such as NO3 : Si and total Hg. Metagenomes contained thaumarchaeal genes encoding for the catalytic subunit of the urease enzyme (ureC) at all depths, suggesting that members of both WCA and the deep, water column "B" (WCB) ecotypes may contain ureC. Coupled urea hydrolysis-ammonia oxidation rates were similar to ammonia oxidation rates alone, suggesting that urea could be an important source of ammonia for mesopelagic ammonia oxidizers. Potential inducement of metal limitation of both ammonia oxidation and urea hydrolysis was demonstrated via additions of a strong metal chelator. The water column inventory of WCA was correlated with the depth-integrated abundance of WCB, with both likely controlled by the flux of sinking particulate organic matter, providing strong evidence of vertical connectivity between the ecotypes. Further, depth-integrated amoA gene abundance and nitrification rates were correlated with particulate organic nitrogen flux measured by contemporaneously deployed sediment traps. Together, the results refine our understanding of the controls on thaumarchaeal distributions in the ocean, and provide new insights on the relationship between material flux and microbial communities in the mesopelagic.

TI Synthesis of oxygen deficient bismuth oxide photocatalyst for improved
   photoelectrochemical applications
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The present paper reports the effect of nitrogen modification on photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation behavior of Bi2O3 semiconductor thin film. The semiconductor particles were synthesized via hydrothermal route using Bi(NO3)(3) as a Bi-3(+) ion precursor and urea as the nitrogen source followed by drop-cast the particles and annealing the film at 600 degrees C. The synthesized Bi2O3 exhibited band gap energy of 3.01 eV, calculated from the UV-visible absorption spectrum which decreases to 2.75 eV through N-modification. Water oxidation behavior of the material has been tested through linear sweep voltammetry under periodic illumination. Highest photo-current of 180 mu Acm(-2) has been measured for water oxidation reaction at 0.95 V vs. Ag/AgCl, under illumination of 35 mWcm(-2). N-incorporation can enhance the photocurrent up to 50% whereas the visible responsiveness of the material improves significantly as confirmed from electrochemical action spectra and UV-visible absorption spectra. The photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor particles was confirmed through decoloration of Rhodamine-B dye, by spectrophotometric measurements. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Circumventing Challenges: Design of Anodic Electrocatalysts for Hybrid
   Water Electrolysis Systems
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Water electrolysis, driven by renewable energy resources, is a promising energy conversion technology that has gained intensive interest in recent years. However, conventional water electrolysis faces a number of challenges, including large thermodynamic potential gaps, valueless anodic products, explosive hydrogen/oxygen mixtures, reactive oxygen species, and limited pure water. Hybrid water electrolysis, appending different electrolytes in the anode compartment to circumvent the above-mentioned challenges in conventional water electrolysis, is a particularly attractive alternative. In this review, for the first time, a holistic and subtle description of hybrid water electrolysis is provided, focusing on the design of high-activity/selectivity/stability anodic electrocatalysts for the electrochemical oxidation of various chemicals, such as alcohol, aldehyde, amine, urea and hydrazine, or the oxygen evolution reaction in seawater electrolytes. Comprehensive judging criteria for anodic oxidation reactions, electrocatalysts, and reaction parameters in hybrid water electrolysis are discussed. Some technoeconomic assessments, feasibility analyses, mechanism explorations, and correlation comparisons are involved. Finally, perspectives on and opportunities for future research directions in hybrid water electrolysis systems are outlined.

AB Novel imidazole modified g-C3N4 were firstly synthesized via a facile one-pot thermo-induced co-condensation method. Characterization results showed that imidazole modification can improve the visible light harvesting, interfacial charge transfer and separation of g-C3N4, without destroying its pristine framework structure. The as-obtained imidazole modified g-C3N4 showed remarkably enhanced and rather stable photocatalytic performance in H-2 evolution, photo-degradation of water contaminants and selective photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol, demonstrating its all-round applications as a versatile photocatalyst. The weight ratio between imidazole and urea was well tuned and the optimal photocatalytic activity was obtained, which shows CNU-I50 sample (50 mg imidazole in 15 g urea) possesses the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 2150 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), superior to most of the previous reported g-C3N4 materials. These results suggest that those imidazole modified g-C3N4 materials are potential photocatalyst when applied to solar energy conversion, water purification and selective photosynthesis reactions.

TI Effects of different complexing agents on the physical properties of ZnO
   nanoparticles
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB ZnO nanoparticles have been synthesised via a co-precipitation method using different complexing agents. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that ZnO nanoparticles were composed of a single hexagonal wurtzite phase. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis indicates that the samples prepared without any complexing agent have slight agglomeration characteristics presenting a prismatic morphology and a wider size distribution from 22 to 72 nm, which provides good material packing density. However, samples synthesised using urea and glycine are similar and show spherical-like morphology. XRD and TEM analyses indicate that complexing agents also have an important role in the size of the ZnO nanoparticles, where the average particle size of 47 and 22 nm were obtained using urea and glycine, respectively.

TI Adsorption and oxidation of 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole-5-one (NTO) and its
   transformation product (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-one, ATO) at
   ferrihydrite and birnessite surfaces
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB The emerging insensitive munitions compound (IMC) 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole-5-one (NTO) is currently being used to replace conventional explosives such as 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX), but the environmental fate of this increasingly widespread IMC remains poorly understood. Upon release from unexploded solid phase ordinances, NTO exhibits high aqueous solubility and, hence, potential mobilization to groundwater. Adsorption and abiotic transformation at metal oxide surfaces are possible mechanisms for natural attenuation. Here, the reactions at ferrihydrite and birnessite surfaces of NTO and its biotransformation product, 3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazol-5-one (ATO), were studied in stirred batch reactor systems at controlled pH (7.0). The study was carried out at metal oxide solid to solution ratios (SSR) of 0.15, 1.5 and 15 g kg(-1). The samples were collected at various time intervals up to 3 h after reaction initiation, and analyzed using HPLC with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detection. We found no detectable adsorption or transformation of NTO upon reaction with birnessite, whereas ATO was highly susceptible to oxidation by the same mineral, showing nearly complete transformation within 5 min at 15 g kg(-1) SSR to urea, CO2(g) and N-2(g). The mean surface-area-normalized pseudo-first order rate constant (k) for ATO oxidation by birnessite across all SSRs was 0.05 +/- 0.022 h(-1) m(-2), and oxidation kinetics were independent of dissolved O-2 concentration. Both NTO and ATO were resistant to oxidation by ferrihydrite. However, NTO showed partial removal from solution upon reaction with ferrihydrite at 0.15 and 1.5 g kg(-1) SSR and complete loss at 15 g kg(-1) SSR due to strong adsorption. Conversely, ATO adsorption to ferrihydrite was much weaker than that measured for NTO. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Zn<SUP>2+</SUP>, and Ga<SUP>3+</SUP> on the iron-based trimetallic
   layered double hydroxides for water oxidation
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB In this work, we synthesized five novel iron-based trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs) by the urea-assisted co-precipitation method for the electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction (WOR). In particular, the synthesized electrocatalysts were labeled CoCuFe-LDH, ZnNiFe-LDH, ZnCoFe-LDH, ZnCuFe-LDH, and CoGaFe-LDH. The electrocatalysts were thoroughly characterized by means of Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), N-2 adsorption/desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We analyzed the changes in the electronic structures, changes in the surface area, and the oxygen vacancies, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the materials had the hydrotalcite-like structure typical of LDHs. Electrochemical results indicated that the best electrocatalyst was the CoGaFe-LDH achieving an overpotential of 369.9 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 64.8 mV dec(-1) in alkaline conditions (KOH 1 M). Additionally, this material displayed a charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of 30.1 omega cm(2). Electrochemical measurements indicated that the materials containing Zn2+ exhibit low kinetics; whilst materials with Co2+ or Ga3+ yield the best performances. The catalytic activity of the CoGaFe-LDH can be attributed to the decrease of the R-ct caused by electronic effects due to the addition of the Ga3+, lowering the thermodynamic barriers and thus enhancing the electron transfer. This work opens the door for a new approach to design efficient multimetallic catalysts based on the transition metals for WOR.

TI Effects of zilpaterol hydrochloride on growth performance, blood
   metabolites, and fatty acid profiles of plasma and adipose tissue in
   finishing steers
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB The effects of zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) on blood metabolites and fatty acid profiles of plasma and adipose tissue were evaluated in crossbred finishing steers (n = 18, BW 639 +/- 12.69 kg) that were stratified by BW and randomly assigned, within strata (block), to receive 0 (control) or 8.33 mg/kg diet DM ZH. Cattle were fed once daily ad libitum in individual feeding pens (9 pens/treatment). Zilpaterol hydrochloride was fed for 23 d and withdrawn 3 d before harvest. Blood samples and measures of BW were taken on d 0, 7, 14, and 21. Concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), glucose, and lactate were determined from whole blood. Nonesterified fatty acids, urea nitrogen (PUN), glucose, lactate, and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) concentrations were analyzed from plasma. Postharvest, adipose tissue samples (approximately 20 g) from subcutaneous fat covering the lumbar vertebrae were collected after 48 h of refrigeration and analyzed for LCFA profiles. Feeding ZH decreased DMI by 8% (P = 0.03) but did not affect BW gain or efficiency (P = 0.83 and P = 0.56, respectively). Addition of ZH resulted in greater HCW, dressing percentage, and LM area (P = 0.02, P = 0.08, and P = 0.07, respectively) but did not influence other carcass traits (P > 0.10). A ZH x d interaction was observed for PUN and whole-blood glucose concentrations (P = 0.06), in which concentrations decreased in cattle receiving ZH. Nonesterified fatty acids, BHB, plasma glucose, whole-blood, and plasma lactate concentrations were unaffected by ZH (P > 0.10). Zilpaterol hydrochloride increased plasma concentrations of elaidic (P = 0.03), vaccenic (P = 0.006), and docosapentaenoic acids (P = 0.08), but LCFA concentrations of adipose tissue were unaffected (P > 0.10), suggesting no preferential oxidation of specific fatty acids. In conclusion, ZH supplementation decreased PUN concentration possibly due to decreased muscle catabolism, but components of blood related to lipid oxidation were unaffected.

TI Highly dispersed Rh prepared by the in-situ etching-growth
   strategy for energy-saving hydrogen evolution
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Background: The development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts that surpass Pt-based catalyst to achieve more efficient hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is significant.
   Methods: Herein, we constructed a series of highly dispersed rhodium (Rh) catalysts anchored on the Nibased layered double hydrotalcite, which were formed by the in-situ etching-growth of nickel-metal organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs). These electrocatalysts not only exhibit outstanding performance in HER, but also in urea oxidation reaction (UOR).
   Significant findings: The nickel-aluminum layered double hydroxide anchored Rh (Rh-NiAl LDH/NF) has the best catalytic activity for HER. It only needs an overpotential of 14 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is in the top class of the currently reported HER catalysts. In addition, the catalyst Rh-NiFe LDH/NF has good catalytic performance for UOR, and it only needs an ultra-low potential of 1.30 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Hence, we constructed an electrolytic cell with the two electrodes for the ureaassisted hydrogen production, which is an energy-saving protocol for HER. The current density of 50 mA cm(-2) can be reached when the cell voltage is only 1.40 V, which is 150 mV less than the traditional water splitting to produce H-2.

AB A series of modified carbonaceous materials has been obtained via nitrogenation, oxidation and thermal treatment of peat-based activated carbons with the use of microwave heating. In order to obtain materials characterised by diverse functional groups content, both in terms of the type and quantity, the starting material was subjected to four different treatment: (1) oxidation with nitric acid followed by heat treatment at 600 degrees C, (2) oxidation with hydrogen peroxide followed by heat treatment at 600 degrees C, (3) annealing in nitrogen atmosphere at 900 degrees C and (4) impregnation with urea followed by heat treatment at 800 degrees C. All the materials under investigation were characterised by elementary analysis, surface area measurements, estimation of the number of surface functional groups as well as by thermal analysis and photoacoustic and mass spectroscopy. Depending on the procedure of modification, the final products were activated carbons of medium developed surface area ranging from 582 to 657m(2)/g, showing basic or intermediate acidic-basic character of the surface and different content of surface functional groups varying from 0.57 to 1.28mmol/g. Based on thermal analysis it was shown, that sample annealed in nitrogen atmosphere is the most thermally stable material. In turn, according to the results obtained both from photoacoustic spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy, samples subjected to oxidation with HNO3 or H2O2 followed by heat treatment with using of microwave radiation are characterised by the highest content of oxygen functional groups.

The influences of different precursors (i.e., melamine, dicyandiamide, and urea) and annealing ambience (i.e., air or N-2) on the catalytic activity were investigated. The resultant g-C3N4 materials exhibited different catalytic activities for PMS activation. The best performance was found in the case of g-C3N4 synthesized from melamine and annealed in N-2 (g-C3N4-Melamine-N-2); 100% BPA (10 mu M) removal was achieved by using 0.5 g/L catalyst and 1 mM PMS at pH 7 in 15 min. The difference in catalytic activities of these g-C3N4 materials might be attributed to the fact that different preparation procedures impacted the chemical composition and structure of catalysts and thus changed the type and density of active sites. Important influencing factors such as PMS dosage, temperature, solution pH, and water matrices on degradation kinetics of BPA were evaluated. Results of quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical were main reactive species for BPA degradation by the g-C3N4/PMS system, which was also confirmed by the non-selectivity of this system towards various organics. Furthermore, possible transformation pathways of BPA by the g-C3N4/PMS system were proposed based on the identified oxidation products, primarily involving hydroxylation, bond cleavage, ring opening, as well as radical coupling. This study deepens mechanistic understanding of g-C3N4 materials driven PMS oxidation processes, and also provides a green and efficient strategy for eliminating BPA in water.

TI Carbon vacancy in C3N4 nanotube: Electronic
   structure, photocatalysis mechanism and highly enhanced activity
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB We demonstrated that carbon vacancy modified C3N4 nanotubes can be qualified for more efficient and selective oxidation of NO to NO3- under visible light illumination than the pristine counterpart. Tubular C3N4 with carbon vacancy was fabricated by facile pyrolysis of the hydrolyzed melamine-urea mixture under N-2 gas. With the particular structural merits for tubular nanostructure and the introduction of suitable carbon vacancy density, richly available surface defect sites, and accelerated separation and transfer of photo-generated charge carriers, the as-prepared carbon vacancy modified C3N4 nanotubes exhibited an excellent photocatalytic NO oxidation performance. Based on ESR measurement and DFT calculation, the electronic structure of carbon vacancy was revealed. The surface carbon vacancy in C3N4 nanotubes can greatly facilitate the adsorption of NO and O-2, therefore, leading to its superior photocatalytic selectivity in conversion of NO to NO3-. The present work provides new insights into the understanding of defective semiconductor photocatalysis.

TI Chronic hyperammonemia causes a hypoglutamatergic and hyperGABAergic
   metabolic state associated with neurobehavioral abnormalities in
   zebrafish larvae
SO EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY
AB Chronic hyperammonemia is a common condition affecting individuals with inherited urea cycle disorders resulting in progressive cognitive impairment and behavioral abnormalities. Altered neurotransmission has been proposed as major source of neuronal dysfunction during chronic hyperammonemia, but the molecular pathomechanism has remained incompletely understood. Here we show that chronic exposure to ammonium acetate induces locomotor dysfunction and abnormal feeding behavior in zebrafish larvae, indicative for an impairment of higher brain functions. Biochemically, chronically elevated ammonium concentrations cause enhanced activity of glutamate decarboxylase isoforms GAD1 and GAD2 with increased formation of GABA and concomitant depletion of glutamate, ultimately leading to a dysfunctional hypoglutamatergic and hyperGABAergic metabolic state. Moreover, elevated GABA concentrations are accompanied by increased expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha-1, gamma-2 and delta, supporting the notion of an increased GABA tone in chronic hyperammonemia. Propionate oxidation as major anaplerotic reaction sufficiently compensates for the transamination-dependent withdrawal of 2-oxoglutarate, thereby preventing bioenergetic dysfunction under chronic hyperammonemic conditions. Thus, our study extends the hypothesis of alterations in the glutamatergic and GABAergic system being an important pathophysiological factor causing neurobehavioral impairment in chronic hyperammonemia. Given that zebrafish larvae have already been successfully used for high-throughput identification of novel compounds to treat inherited neurological diseases, the reported zebrafish model should be considered an important tool for systematic drug screening targeting altered glutamatergic and GABAergic metabolism under chronic hyperammonemic conditions in the future.

TI Efficient remediation of PAHs contaminated site soil using the novel
   slow-release oxidant material
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The eco-friendly slow-release material for persulfate (PS) using chitosan (CS) and urea (U) composite as frame structure (CS-U@PS) was firstly used to remediate the site soil contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from Hefei city, China. The influences of glutaraldehyde dosage and urea dosage on the slow released properties of CS-U@PS was investigated and a longer release time of 190.0 d to 591.0 d was achieved, indicating the promising tunability according to the contents of pollutants in site soil. The effects of various factors (cross-linking agent dosage, initial PAHs concentration, CS-U@PS dosage, hydrogen peroxide dosage, etc.) on the degradation of soil spiked with PAHs (80 and 8 mg.kg(-1)) by CS-U@PS were studied, and the degradation pathway of PAHs was speculated. According to the EPR results, urea played an important role in promoting the O-1(2) generation, which was the main reactive oxidative species. Finally, the long-term remediation of the industrial site soil with total PAHs of 553.2 mg.kg(-1) was performed using 50 mg.g(-1) soil CS-U@PS and 90.22% removal rate was obtained after nine months. Moreover, the monitoring results of soil respiration gas show that, in addition to CO2, there is no additional greenhouse gas generated in the process of soil remediation, suggesting that the remediation of site soil using CS-U@PS has an excellent application prospect.

TI Application of a new porous bimetallic H-bond catalyst in the
   preparation of biological henna-based pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolines via a
   cooperative vinylogous anomeric based oxidation
SO MOLECULAR CATALYSIS
AB Bimetallic organic frameworks (bimetallic-MOFs) are considered promising catalysts due to their tunable pores, strength, and high catalytic performance. Here, a bimetallic-MOF-based on iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) metals was designed, synthesized and characterized. Next, the synthesized bimetallic-MOFs were post-modified with phenyl isocyanate to create urea moieties that are susceptible to hydrogen bonding (H-bond) catalytic activities. Various techniques such as SEM, XRD, BET/BJH, FT-IR, TGA/DTA, EDX and elemental-mapping were used to approve the structure of the synthesized catalyst. MIL-88B(Fe2/Co)-UR acts as an H-bond catalyst in the multi-component reaction to form pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolines via appropriate sections with medicinal properties. The features of using MIL-88B(Fe2/Co)-UR as an H-bond catalyst are increased efficiency, decreased reaction time and reusability of the catalyst.

TI Defect-engineered tri-metallic CuCoSnOx heterostructure bifunctional
   electrocatalysts for energy-efficient hydrogen production at high
   current density
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The high energy consumption and low efficiency of electrocatalysts restrict the widespread application of electrochemical water decomposition, despite being a productive method of producing industrial hydrogen. This paper proposes an oxygen vacancy-rich CuCoSnOx_500 synthesis method based on heterostructure engineering and defect introduction. The addition of various metals or anion vacancy defects modifies the properties of the catalyst and enhances surface adsorption, desorption, and electrocatalytic kinetics. The CuCoSnOx_500 exhibits 123 and 272 mV overpotential to acquire 10 and 25 mA/cm2 current density for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. CuCoSnOx_500 exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, with a cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA/cm2 current density in 1 M KOH and 1.52 V in 1 M KOH with 0.3 M urea. The cell voltage remained constant for 40 h for the electrocatalyst at 100 mA/cm2 in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. This work presents a practical method for designing dual-purpose electrocatalysts to generate hydrogen at high current density efficiently.

TI A facile synthesis of N-doped carbon encapsulated multimetallic
   carbonitride as a robust electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising solution for generating clean hydrogen. Transition metal compounds are among the most extensively investigated catalysts developed to date for water oxidation in alkaline media, a process also known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the application of these catalysts was constrained by insufficient stability arising from surface oxidation and metal dissolution under high OER potential. In this work, we developed a facile approach using urea-based gel as the precursor of preparing a series of multimetallic carbonitride particles which were encapsulated by N-doped carbon (NC). In particular, (MoCoFeNiZr)CN@NC core-shell structure delivered a low overpotential of 246 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm- 2 in 1 M KOH during OER. Importantly, operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), together with multiple microscopic and spectroscopic analyses, indicated that the NC shells effectively maintained the crystalline stability of carbonitride via suppressing the surface reconstruction during catalysis. The highly graphitic NC also demonstrates excellent stability against oxidation. This work shows a promising strategy of stabilizing electrocatalyst at high anodic potential, paving the way for the development of robust electrode materials for energy conversion.

TI In situ fabrication of layered double hydroxide film immobilizing gold
   nanoparticles in capillary microreactor for efficient catalytic
   carbonylation of glycerol
SO MOLECULAR CATALYSIS
AB Microreactor is capable of intensifying catalytic reaction processes. The fabricating of catalytic film inside microchannels for catalytic reaction remains a challenge. Here we report a facile method for in situ fabrication of layered double hydroxide (LDH) film immobilizing gold nanoparticles in capillary microreactor. Through adjusting the reaction condition of in situ hydrothermal crystallization process and flow deposition process inside microchannel, film thickness, film morphology and Au loading of Au/LDH coating can be finely controlled. Such Au/LDH film inside microchannel exhibited good performance in catalytic carbonylation of glycerol with urea. The yield of glycerol carbonate reached 31.9% at flow rate of 10 mu l/min, residence time of 6.62 min and reaction temperature of 413 K under atmospheric pressure. The maximum productivity of 3.78 g.h- 1.g 1 was obtained at flow rate of 40 mu l/min and residence time of 1.65 min under same reaction temperature and pressure. Continuously running the microreactor for 30 h proved the high stability of this catalytic film inside microchannels. This approach could be extended to fabricate other diatomic and triatomic metal LDH films immobilizing metal nanoparticles inside microchannels for heterogeneous catalysis.

TI Prolonged Fasting Identifies Heat Shock Protein 10 as a Sirtuin 3
   Substrate ELUCIDATING A NEW MECHANISM LINKING MITOCHONDRIAL PROTEIN
   ACETYLATION TO FATTY ACID OXIDATION ENZYME FOLDING AND FUNCTION
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Although Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a mitochondrially enriched deacetylase and activator of fat oxidation, is down-regulated in response to high fat feeding, the rate of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial protein acetylation are invariably enhanced in this dietary milieu. These paradoxical data implicate that additional acetylation modification-dependent levels of regulation may be operational under nutrient excess conditions. Because the heat shock protein (Hsp) Hsp10-Hsp60 chaperone complex mediates folding of the fatty acid oxidation enzyme mediumchain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, we tested whether acetylation-dependent mitochondrial protein folding contributes to this regulatory discrepancy. We demonstrate that Hsp10 is a functional SIRT3 substrate and that, in response to prolonged fasting, SIRT3 levels modulate mitochondrial protein folding. Acetyl mutagenesis of Hsp10 lysine 56 alters Hsp10-Hsp60 binding, conformation, and protein folding. Consistent with Hsp10-Hsp60 regulation of fatty acid oxidation enzyme integrity, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity and fat oxidation are elevated by Hsp10 acetylation. These data identify acetyl modification of Hsp10 as a nutrient-sensing regulatory node controlling mitochondrial protein folding and metabolic function.

SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Paracetamol (PCT) is a widely prescribed pharmaceutical. PCT is partially excreted in the urine after uptake. It has been detected in many natural waters worldwide. Trace concentrations of PCT detrimentally affect the environment. Direct treatment of PCT in urine can alleviate and minimize unintended release to the environment. This work presents the remediation of several urine matrices contaminated with PCT by electrochemical oxidation (EO) with a boron -doped diamond (BDD) anode. Effective drug abatement was found for PTC concentrations <= 20 mg L-1 in fresh synthetic urine at 48 mA cm -2. Uric acid was also completely removed, but only partial degradation was found for creatinine and urea. While 91 % of 2.5 mg L-1 PCT was removed in hydrolyzed real urine, only 48 % was degraded in fresh real urine. Release of N -species was quantified and carboxylic acids resulting from PCT degradation identified. The electrochemical treatment attained complete removal of PCT.

TI Conformational plasticity surrounding the active site of NADH oxidase
   from Thermus thermophilus
SO PROTEIN SCIENCE
AB Biotechnological applications of enzymes can involve the use of these molecules under nonphysiological conditions. Thus, it is of interest to understand how environmental variables affect protein structure and dynamics and how this ultimately modulates enzyme function. NADH oxidase (NOX) from Thermus thermophilus exemplifies how enzyme activity can be tuned by reaction conditions, such as temperature, cofactor substitution, and the addition of cosolutes. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of reduced NAD(P)H to NAD(P)(+) with the concurrent reduction of O-2 to H2O2, with relevance to biosensing applications. It is thermophilic, with an optimum temperature of approximately 65 degrees C and sevenfold lower activity at 25 degrees C. Moderate concentrations (approximate to 1M) of urea and other chaotropes increase NOX activity by up to a factor of 2.5 at room temperature. Furthermore, it is a flavoprotein that accepts either FMN or the much larger FAD as cofactor. We have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration and N-15 spin relaxation experiments together with isothermal titration calorimetry to study how NOX structure and dynamics are affected by changes in temperature, the addition of urea and the substitution of the FMN cofactor with FAD. The majority of signals from NOX are quite insensitive to changes in temperature, cosolute addition, and cofactor substitution. However, a small cluster of residues surrounding the active site shows significant changes. These residues are implicated in coupling changes in the solution conditions of the enzyme to changes in catalytic activity.

TI Patterns of thaumarchaeal gene expression in culture and diverse marine
   environments
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Thaumarchaea are ubiquitous in marine habitats where they participate in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Although metatranscriptomes suggest thaumarchaea are active microbes in marine waters, we understand little about how thaumarchaeal gene expression patterns relate to substrate utilization and activity. Here, we report the global transcriptional response of the marine ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeon Candidatus Nitrosopelagicus brevis' str. CN25 to ammonia limitation using RNA-Seq. We further describe the genome and transcriptome of Ca. N. brevis str. U25, a new strain capable of urea utilization. Ammonia limitation in CN25 resulted in reduced expression of transcripts coding for ammonia oxidation proteins, and increased expression of a gene coding an Hsp20-like chaperone. Despite significantly different transcript abundances across treatments, two ammonia monooxygenase subunits (amoAB), a nitrite reductase (nirK) and both ammonium transporter genes were always among the most abundant transcripts, regardless of growth state. Ca. N. brevis str. U25 cells expressed a urea transporter 139-fold more than the urease catalytic subunit ureC. Gene coexpression networks derived from culture transcriptomes and 10 thaumarchaea-enriched metatranscriptomes revealed a high degree of correlated gene expression across disparate environmental conditions and identified a module of coexpressed genes, including amoABC and nirK, that we hypothesize to represent the core ammonia oxidation machinery.

TI Porous Ir-Sn Binary Oxide Nanorod Assembly as an Efficient
   Electrocatalyst for Water Oxidation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The large-scale deployment of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis technologies is hindered by the usage of high-cost and scarce noble metal oxides as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an anode. Herein, we provided a facile method to synthesize Ir-Sn binary oxides in the form of a nanorod assembly with a large number of pores and a lower Ir content as efficient catalysts for the OER. The deep eutectic solvent formed by glucose and urea plays a crucial role in the synthesis. When heating the deep eutectic solution containing IrCl3 and SnCl2 at 180 degrees C, the polymerization and the following expansion of glucose produces a bread-like porous foam with embedded Ir and Sn metal ions. During the following calcination process in Ar and air, the sintering of the catalyst is inhibited owing to the blocking effect of the glucose-derived carbonaceous material, and the removal of the carbonaceous species produces pores in the final product. The -NH2 groups in urea can form complexes with the Ir and Sn metal ions, which is beneficial to to obtain the formation of an Ir-Sn binary oxide with uniform composition. As a result, an Ir-Sn oxide with an Ir/Sn molar ratio at 2/1 presents the best catalytic activity for the OER among the Ir-Sn oxides, which is almost identical to that of a mono-Ir oxide. The method in this work provided a pathway to fabricate high-performance OER catalysts with low Ir content.

AB Novel highly efficient heterostructured photocatalysts consisting of g-C3N4 nanosheets on hexangular flowerlike FeWO4 microcrystals were first fabricated via an in situ growth approach. The intimate g-C3N4 coating layers (ca. 50-130 nm) on the surface of FeWO4 microcrystals were observed through transmission electron microscopy. An all-side evaluation of its performance toward typical photoassisted oxidation and reduction reactions was carried out, which exhibited drastically improved performance for photocatalytic oxygen production and photo degradation, while obviously suppressed hydrogen evolution activity when compared with the bulk g-C3N4 (CNU). The optimal photocatalyst CNU-FW90 (90 mg of FeWO4 in 15 g of urea) displayed an oxygen evolution rate of 303 mu mol/(g h), about 2.4 and 3.8 times as much as that of CNU and FeWO4, respectively. Not only that, CNU-FW90 showed superior degradation activity with a reaction kinetics rate constant of 0.1192 min(-1), nearly 5-fold higher than that of the pure CNU. By correlating the performance with the band structures and surface valence states of g-C3N4@FeWO4 heterojunctions, a possible mechanism was proposed to uncover the differences between oxidation and reduction reactions in this system, which highlighted the crucial role of Fe3+/Fe2+ couple in tuning the performance of photocatalytic reactions. This work put forward a promising strategy to design highly efficient semiconductor photocatalysts and shed light on the vital effect of surface valence state of Fe element in tuning the performance of Fe-related photocatalysts.

TI Functionalization of the Position 5 of Thiopyran Fragment of
   4-(Diethoxyphosphoryl)-4,7-dihydro-5H-thiopyrano[3,4-b]fur
   an
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY
AB The functionalization of 4-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-4,7-dihydro-5H-thiopyrano[3,4-b]furan was carried out at the position 5 of thiopyran fragment. Alkaline hydrolysis of ethyl-4-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-4,7-dihydro-5H-thiopyrano[3,4-b]furan-5-carboxylate proceeds selectively at the ester group. The acid formed, when treated with thionyl chloride, gives the corresponding acid chloride. The latter was used for the acylation of glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine esters. Acid chloride under the conditions of phase transfer catalysis forms acyl azide, which under mild conditions rearranges to isocyanate. The latter compound reacts with primary amines to form ureas, and with amino acid esters-the ureide esters. Reduction of the acid chloride with sodium borohydride leads to the corresponding alcohol. The chloride obtained from it reacts with sodium azide and iodide to form the usual products of nucleophilic substitution, and with potassium thiocyanate it gives thiocyanate. Iodide reacts with triethyl phosphite to form the corresponding phosphonate. The oxidation of alcohol with Collins reagent and the acetic anhydride-DSMO system was studied.

TI First characterisation of two important postulated intermediates in the
   formation of a HydT DNA lesion, a thymidine oxidation product
SO ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY
AB A number of environmental pollutants and endogenous oxidation agents form 1-(2-deoxy--d-ribofuranosyl)-5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin (HydT), an important DNA lesion resulting from thymidine oxidation. In this paper, two intermediates, postulated in the formation of HydT, have been characterised for the first time. The first, N-1-formyl-N-3-pyruvoylurea intermediate, was produced by the ozonolysis reaction of 2,3,5-tri-O-acetylribo-, 3,5-di-O-TBS- and N-3,O-3,O-5-tribenzyl-protected thymidines and was shown to produce, upon decomposition and depending on the protecting group and the conditions, HydT alone, or together with protected--d-ribofuranosyl-N-1-formylurea and formamide products. In addition, the second and long sought, open-chain-pyruvoylurea intermediate, was produced through de novo synthesis in protected -d-ribofuranosyl-, 2-deoxy--d-ribofuranosyl- and 2-deoxy--d-ribopyranosyl systems. The conditions that induce the cyclization to the hydantoin ring of HydT have been determined. The chemistry utilised in the de novo synthesis is suitable for generating isotopically labelled HydT, as a reference in isotope-dilution-aided quantification of DNA damage.

TI Bubble-template synthesis of WO3•0.5H2O hollow
   spheres as a high-activity catalyst for catalytic oxidation of benzyl
   alcohol to benzaldehyde
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB Although significant progress has been made in WO3 hollow spheres, it is still a challenge to synthesize WO3 center dot 0.5H(2)O hollow spheres. Herein, a strategy for the preparation of well-shaped WO3 center dot 0.5H(2)O hollow spheres was developed by a facile bubble-template method using urea as a foaming agent in the solvothermal process with EtOH-H2O mixture solvent. In this process, the growth of WO3 center dot 0.5H(2)O nanoparticles is limited by N-containing organic compounds, thus these nanoparticles tend to agglomerate along the surface of bubbles (CO2 and NH3) to fabricate hollow spheres with pores formed in the wall, and after low temperature calcination, pure WO3 center dot 0.5H(2)O hollow spheres are obtained. The obtained WO3 center dot 0.5H(2)O hollow spheres exhibit enhanced activity in catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde: the conversions of benzyl alcohol, 4-methyl, 3-methyl, 2-methyl, 4-bromo and 4-nitro benzyl alcohol are 99.2%, 95.0%, 97.1%, 86.7%, 98.0%, 90.6%, respectively, and the selectivities to corresponding benzaldehydes are all greater than 98%. The high activity of WO3 center dot 0.5H(2)O hollow spheres could be attributed to surface -OH groups and the hollow and porous structure.

TI The effect of photoactivated transformations of Ag<SUP>+</SUP> and
   Ag<SUP>0</SUP> in silica fillers on their biocidal activity
SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB Ag and AgCu containing powdered silica fillers of polymers for medical applications have been synthesized using mechanochemical activation with a low content of solvent or dry powdered materials. The samples in the form of filled polymer films were obtained using polyurethane-urea and silica nanocomposites. The composites have been investigated by TEM, UV/Vis spectroscopy, XRD and microbiological analysis. It has been found that amorphous and nanosized structures of silver oxides and metallic Ag nanocrystallites are formed during thermal destruction of silver nitrate or ammonium complexes in silica matrix (fumed or precipitated silica). Sunlight exposure of nanocomposites contained Ag+ ions leads to the formation of Ag-0 nanocrystallites. After UV irradiation, the decrease in surface plasmon resonance band intensity can be caused by the oxidation of Ag-0. It is found that silica nanocomposites with the low Ag content (0.2mmolg(-1) SiO2) exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity, whereas the polymeric film with a filler content of 1wt% exhibited the most efficient antimicrobial properties among tested polymeric composites. The observed transformations (Ag+<-> Ag-0) of silver compounds do not suppress the biocidal activity of nanocomposites.

TI Persulfate-based visible photocatalysis with a novel stability enhanced
   Fe-based metal-organic framework
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB Enhancing the water stability is the critical issue for metal-organic frameworks to explore their potential as photocatalysts for water treatment. In this study, a postsynthetic modification (PSM) method was applied, and MIL-101(Fe)-NH2 was modified to form a new MIL-101(Fe)-1-(4-(methyl)phenyl)urea (named MIL-101(Fe)MPU). Chemical structure analyses confirmed a conversion from amino group to urea group. After PSM, grafting of a carbamido-benzene-methyl arm increased the surface hydrophobicity of MIL-101(Fe)-MPU with a large contact angle (> 100 degrees). As a consequence, MIL-101(Fe)-MPU presented a better water stability compared to MIL101(Fe)-NH2. After a 72-h liquid water exposure, chemical skeleton structure of MIL-101(Fe)-MPU were retained. In the presences of visible light and persulfate, both MIL-101(Fe)-NH2 and MIL-101(Fe)-MPU demonstrated equivalent photocatalysis degradation efficiencies of ciprofloxacin (CIP) in water matrix. The removal of CIP fit a quasi-first-order kinetic with apparent rate constants at 0.0440 min(-1) (MIL-101(Fe)-NH2) and 0.0396 min(-1) (MIL-101(Fe)-MPU). The dominant reaction mechanism in light/MIL-101(Fe)-MPU/S(2)O(8)(2-)system was verified to be visible photocatalysis, including OH. and SO4.- oxidation. In general, MIL-101(Fe)-MPU presented an enhanced water stability, contributing to its potential photocatalysis applications in water treatments.

TI Activation of Hydrogen Peroxide and Solid Peroxide Reagents by Phosphate
   Ion in Alkaline Solution
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB Hydrogen peroxide (HP) and its derivatives can serve as useful bulk oxidants for soil and water treatment provided activation is supplied. Solutions of a model compound methylene blue (MB) were treated with HP, urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP), sodium perborate (SPB), sodium percarbonate (SPC), or calcium peroxide (CP). In unbuffered systems, addition of HP or UHP was ineffective in decolorizing MB, whereas addition of SPB or SPC was moderately effective due to the known ability of borate or carbonate ions, respectively, to activate H2O2. Addition of CP caused moderate decolorization as well, but base hydrolysis contributed due to the high pH (similar to 12). Decolorization of MB in HP, UHP, SPB, and SPC systems was greatly accelerated when mixtures were buffered at pH 10 with phosphate (25 mM) compared to mixtures where pH was unadjusted, NaOH adjusted, or carbonate adjusted. Decolorization correlated strongly with decomposition of active peroxide (AP), implying a shared pathway. Decolorization was highly inefficient relative to AP decomposition, however. This study represents the first example, to our knowledge, demonstrating activation of H2O2 by phosphate toward oxidation of organic compounds. It is suggested that the reactive oxidant species responsible for decolorization and AP loss in the presence of phosphate is, or is derived from, HPO52-.

TI Trapping of oil molecules in clathrates: Oil trapping mechanism, soil
   composition and thermal studies
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS
AB In the present study, oil spiked soil samples were cleaned up using clathrates, by proposing an innovative mechanism, formed by different combinations of salts like sodium chloride, urea, thiourea and hydroquinone. The clathrates formed act as trap for the oil molecules present in the contaminated soil. The effects of various parameters viz.; medium pH, rpm, salt amount and contact time were studied in the batch mode. For the batch studies, Langmuir isotherrn model was applied and provided best fit to the equilibrium data obtained with R-2 = 0.99. The maximum oil removal efficiency 87% was obtained using combination B (2.0 g each of sodium chloride, Urea, Thiourea and hydroquinone) at pH 9.0, 180 rpm within 60 min in batch mode. Column studies were also carried out using different salts combination at different flow rates (1.0, 2.0, 3.0 mL min(-1)). The maximum oil removal efficiency 84% was obtained using combination B at flow rate of 1.0 mL Further, the MR and TGA studies confirmed the formation of clathrates and their application as cages for oil removal from oil spiked soil samples. The outcomes from this study assured that the oil trapping by clathrates is a newly developed and quite effective technique which could be used for treating oil contaminated soils at large scale.

TI NOx reduction and N2O emissions in a diesel engine
   exhaust using Fe-zeolite and vanadium based SCR catalysts
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB Among various approaches used to comply with strict diesel engine exhaust regulations, there is increasing interest in urea based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) as a NOx reduction technology, due to its high reduction and excellent fuel efficiencies. NOx reduction by SCR catalysts is affected by variations in the NO2/NOx ratio, caused by oxidation catalysts such as the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and diesel particulate filter (DPF) installed in diesel engines. Recently, it has been reported that the greenhouse gas (GHG) variant N2O, which is a by-product of the NOx conversion process in the after-treatment system, will be subject to regulation.
   Using a real diesel engine installed with DOC and DPF, the NOx reduction and N2O emission performances of commonly used Fe-zeolite and V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalysts were investigated under various operating conditions. The exhaust of the diesel engine used in this study had a NO2/NOx ratio of over 50% for temperatures below 400 degrees C due to the oxidation catalysts, while the NO2/NOx ratio was significantly lower for temperatures above 400 degrees C. Under such conditions, it was found that the Fe-zeolite and V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalysts were noticeably affected by the NO2/NOx ratio and exhaust temperature. Although both catalysts showed satisfactory NO conversions, the V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst showed decreasing NO2 conversion rates between 250 degrees C and 320 degrees C. The V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst exhibited NH3 slip relatively frequently because of its low NH3 storage capacity.
   For the Fe-zeolite catalyst, a significant increase in the amount of generated N2O was observed for high NOx conversion conditions due to side reactions with ammonia, NO2, and oxygen, while that phenomenon was not observed for the V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst.

SO FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB The high Fischer (F) ratio hemp peptide (HFHP) was prepared by enrichment using activated carbon adsorption, ultrafiltration, and Sephadex G-25 gel filtration chromatography. The OD220/OD280 ratio reached 47.1 with a molecular weight distribution from 180 to 980 Da, a peptide yield up to 21.7 %, and the F value was 31.5. HFHP had high scavenging ability of DPPH, hydroxyl free radicals, and superoxide. Mice experiments showed that the HFHP increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The HFHP had no effect on the body weight of mice, but prolonged their weight-bearing swimming time. The lactic acid, serum urea nitrogen, and malondialdehyde of the mice after swimming was reduced, and the liver glycogen increased. The correlation analysis indicated that the HFHP had significant anti-oxidation and anti-fatigue properties.

TI Magnetic nitrogen-doped nanocarbons for enhanced metal-free catalytic
   oxidation: Integrated experimental and theoretical investigations for
   mechanism and application
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Developing efficient, low-cost and environmental-friendly catalysts is of great significance for heterogeneous activation of persulfates toward strategic purification of wastewater with powerful sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs). In this study, a three-dimensional and hierarchical nitrogen-doped magnetic carbon (Co@N-C) was developed via a facile one-pot carbonization of ZIF-67 with a green precursor of urea. Acid treatment was applied to remove the surface unstable cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) to avoid the potential leaching of toxic Co ions. Benefited from the rationally structural design of the carbon precursor and post-treatment with surface engineering, the derived Co@N-C can efficiently activate PMS for fast decomposition of bisphenol A (BPA) in aqueous solution, achieving high removal of total organic carbon (TOC) with trace cobalt leaching. The impacts of diverse reaction parameters on BPA degradation were systematically investigated. More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the entrapped Co NPs can impressively modulate the electronic states of the interacted carbon regions, giving rise to enhanced carbocatalysis with synergistic promotion of N-doping. The embedded Co NPs also afford the carbocatalysts to be magnetic for an easy recycling. Additionally, comprehensive investigations of the evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the carbonaceous materials by competitive radical scavenging tests and in situ radical trapping with advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed the singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) as the dominant ROS rather than sulfate radicals. This study proposed a facile strategy for fabricating novel hybrid nanocarbon catalysts with N-doping and magnetic property and enables new mechanistic insights into carbocatalysis in AOPs, providing a promising system for green wastewater remediation.

TI Curcumin alleviated oxidation stress injury by mediating osteopontin in
   nephrolithiasis rats
SO ACTA CIRURGICA BRASILEIRA
AB Purpose: To explore the role and mechanism of curcumin (Cur) in reducing oxidative stress damage in rats with nephrolithiasis induced by ethylene glycol (EG). Methods: Thirty male rats were divided into normal control, model, positive (10% potassium citrate), Cur-10 (10 mg/kg curcumin) and Cur-20 (20 mg/kg curcumin) groups. Results: The results of kidney tissue section stained by hematoxylin-eosin and von Kossa showed that curcumin treatment can inhibit the formation of kidney stones. The biochemical test results showed that the urea (Ur), creatinine (Cr), uric acid (UA), inorganic phosphorus and Ca2+ concentrations in urine decreased after being treated with curcumin. There were significant differences between different doses of curcumin (P < 0.05). Compared with the Cur-10 group, Cur-20 had a more significant inhibitory effect on malondialdehyde (MDA) (P < 0.05). In addition, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection and immunohistochemical results indicated that the osteopontin (OPN) in the kidney was significantly reduced after curcumin treatment. Conclusion: Curcumin could reduce the oxidative stress damage caused by EG-induced kidney stones.

TI Impact of diesel emission fluid soaking on the performance of Cu-zeolite
   catalysts for diesel NH3-SCR systems
SO JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE A
AB Diesel emission fluid (DEF) soaking and urea deposits on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts are critical issues for real diesel engine NH3-SCR systems. To investigate the impact of DEF soaking and urea deposits on SCR catalyst performance, fresh Cu-zeolite catalyst samples were drilled from a full-size SCR catalyst. Those samples were impregnated with DEF solutions and subsequently hydrothermally treated to simulate DEF soaking and urea deposits on real SCR catalysts during diesel engine operations. Their SCR performance was then evaluated in a flow reactor with a four-step test protocol. Test results show that the DEF soaking leached some Cu from the SCR catalysts and slightly reduced their Cu loadings. The loss of Cu and associated metal sites on the catalysts weakened their catalytic oxidation abilities and caused lower NO/NH3 oxidation and lower high-temperature N20 selectivity. Lower Cu loading also made the catalysts less active to the decomposition of surface ammonium nitrates and decreased low-temperature N2O selectivity. Cu loss during DEF impregnation released more acid sites on the surface of the catalysts and increased their acidities, and more NH3 was able to be adsorbed and involved in SCR reactions at medium and high temperatures. Due to lower NH3 oxidation and higher NH3 storage, the DEF-impregnated SCR catalyst samples showed higher NOx conversion above 400 degrees C compared with the non-soaked one. The negative impact of urea deposits during DEF impregnation was not clearly observed, because the high-temperature hydrothermal treatment helped to remove the urea deposits.

TI Rational design of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts with intramolecular
   donor-acceptor structures for deep oxidation of emerging organic
   micropollutants
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB An in-situ route for the fabrication of intramolecular electron donor-acceptor (D-A) structured g-C3N4 photocatalysts is developed by the preorganization of urea with the precursor of electron donor units, such as 4-iodobenzaldehyde, 5-bromo-2-thiophenaldehyde and 5-bromo-2-furaldehyde, followed by thermal polymerization. In the resulting benzene unit-, thiophene unit- and furan unit-based D-A structured g-C3N4 photocatalysts, namely, BHCNx, SCNx, and OCNx, the incorporated electron donor units (i.e., benzene units, thiophene units and furan units) link with the electron acceptors (i.e., heptazine units) through C-N and C--N covalent bonds. In comparison of bulk g-C3N4, all D-A structured g-C3N4 display notably enhanced visible-light photocatalytic oxidation activity in the degradation of emerging organic micropollutants, p-nitrophenol (PNP) and methylparaben (MPB), in which the apparent first-order kinetic constant of the optimized BHCN2, SCN2, and OCN2 is 1.6, 3.0 and 6.8 times higher than bulk g-C3N4 for PNP degradation and 1.9, 3.4 and 2.6 times higher than bulk gC3N4 for MPB degradation. Importantly, the micropollutants can be not only degraded but also mineralized completely. The catalysts are also robust in the removal of mixed emerging organic micropollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater, exhibiting potential of dealing with organic micropollutants in wastewater. Mechanism studies reveal that the unique intramolecular charge transfer process in the catalysts enhances visible-light harvesting capacity, boosts directional transfer of the photogenerated charges and increases adsorption towards oxygen molecules. These collective improvements can maximum utilization the photogenerated electrons and holes to yield plentiful reactive oxygen species for deep oxidization of the pollutants.

TI Rational design of covalent heptazine framework photocatalysts with high
   oxidation ability through reaction-dependent strategy
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Due to structural tunability, high surface area, abundant pore structures, and abundant active sites, covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) constructed from heptazine and other molecular blocks are especially prominent. Here, we proposed a reaction-dependent strategy for designing two dimensional CHFs including high-throughput precursors screening, structure generation, and performance evaluation. Assuming that oxamide-like precursors can undergo the same thermal polymerization reaction as producing C6N7, seven precursors were screened from more than 10(9) molecules in the ZINC20 database in terms of molecular weight, number of substructures, shape index, and symmetry. Furthermore, CHF-L1 to CHF-L7 were constructed from urea and the seven precursors according to the topologically assembling scheme in thermal polymerization. The designed CHFs had band gaps ranging from 1.89 to 3.10 eV. Among them, CHF-L3 assembled structurally by urea and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxamide with the smallest bandgap and an oxidative potential bias of 1.38 V for oxygen evolution reaction was screened as the candidate with high oxidative ability. The negative formation energy based on the synthesis route indicated the synthetic feasibility of CHF-L3, and negative cohesive energy as well as the stable structure under ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of CHF-L3. The present work is expected to provide a powerful design strategy for two-dimensional CHFs design and is broadly applicable to various computational covalent organic framework design systems and experimental studies.

TI In vitro nitazoxanide exposure affects energetic metabolism of
   Taenia crassiceps
SO EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY
AB Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a broad-spectrum drug used in intestinal infections, but still poorly explored in the treatment of parasitic tissular infections. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro responses of the energetic metabolism of T. crassiceps cysticerci induced by NTZ. The organic acids of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, products derived from fatty acids oxidation and protein catabolism were analyzed. These acids were quantified after 24 h of in vitro exposure to different NTZ concentrations. A positive control group was performed with albendazole sulfoxide (ABZSO). The significant alterations in citrate, fumarate and malate concentrations showed the NTZ influence in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The non-detection of acetate confirmed that the main mode of action of NTZ is effective against T. crassiceps cysticerci. The statistical differences in fumarate, urea and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations showed the NTZ effect on protein catabolism and fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, the main energetic pathways such as the TCA cycle, protein catabolism and fatty acids oxidation were altered after in vitro NTZ exposure. In conclusion, NTZ induced a significant metabolic stress in the parasite indicating that it may be used as an alternative therapeutic choice for cysticercosis treatment. The use of metabolic approaches to establish comparisons between anti parasitic drugs mode of actions is proposed.

TI Bimetallic Pd-Co Nanoparticles Supported on Nitrogen-Doped Reduced
   Graphene Oxide as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Formic Acid
   Electrooxidation
SO CATALYSTS
AB In this work, bimetallic PdxCoy nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide catalysts were synthesized and tested for formic acid oxidation as potentially efficient and durable electrocatalysts. Graphene oxide was nitrogen doped through hydrothermal chemical reduction with urea as a nitrogen source. The PdxCoy nanoparticles were deposited on the nitrogen-doped graphene oxide support using the impregnation-reduction method with sodium borohydride as a reducing agent and sodium citrate dihydrate as a stabilizing agent. The structural features, such as phases, composition, oxidation states, and particle sizes, of the nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Pd nanoparticle sizes in Pd1Co1/N-rGO, Pd/N-rGO, and Pd1Co1/CNT were 3.5, 12.51, and 4.62 nm, respectively. The electrochemical performance of the catalysts was determined by CO stripping, cyclic voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. Pd1Co1/N-rGO showed the highest mass activity of 4833.12 mA(-1) mg Pd, which was twice that of Pd1Co1/CNT. Moreover, Pd1Co1/N-rGO showed a steady-state current density of 700 mA(-1) mg Pd after 5000 s in chronoamperometry carried out at +0.35 V. Apart from the well-known bifunctional effect of Co, nitrogen-doped graphene contributed to the performance enhancement of the Pd1Co1/N-rGO catalyst.

TI Improved low-temperature activity for marine selective catalytic
   reduction systems
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART M-JOURNAL OF
   ENGINEERING FOR THE MARITIME ENVIRONMENT
AB Through the international work carried out recently by International Maritime Organization Marine Environment Protection Committee, the need for improved selective catalytic reduction systems for marine applications at low and transient temperatures has been acknowledged. It is of importance to improve the low-temperature activity to achieve compliance with the upcoming stricter International Maritime Organization NOX regulation (Tier III, 80% reduction) for ships. This study therefore investigates the possibilities to improve the low-temperature activity for a commercial vanadium-based urea-selective catalytic reduction catalyst for marine applications. By altering the NO2/NOX ratio, the reaction proceeds in the fast selective catalytic reduction reaction regime, which is especially beneficial at low and transient temperatures and in combination with SO2 and H2O. For both steady-state and transient modes, it is suggested that an improved low-temperature activity for the marine selective catalytic reduction system can be achieved by increasing the NO2/NOX ratio to 50%, whereby utilizing the fast selective catalytic reduction reaction scheme. The fast selective catalytic reduction can significantly improve the NOX reduction already at 250 degrees C in the presence of water or sulfur. The fast selective catalytic reduction will, however, require an increased NO2 fraction in the exhaust gases, preferably 50%, which may be achieved by placing an oxidation catalyst upstream of the selective catalytic reduction. The use of an oxidation catalyst upstream of the selective catalytic reduction can offer a possibility to achieve International Maritime Organization Tier III compliance at low and transient temperatures, but to avoid formation of ammonium nitrates and possible ammonium sulfates, temperatures should be kept above 250 degrees C in combination with marine fuels with a maximum of 0.10 wt% S.

TI Highly Active Cerium Oxide Supported Solution Combustion Cu/Mn Catalysts
   for CO-PrOx in a Hydrogen-Rich Stream
SO CATALYSTS
AB Mono- and di-substituted cerium oxide catalysts, viz. Ce0.95Cu0.05O2-delta, Ce0.90Cu0.10O2-delta, Ce0.90 Cu0.05Mn0.05O2-delta, Ce0.85Cu0.10Mn0.05O2-delta, and Ce0.80Cu0.10Mn0.10O2-delta, were synthesized via a one-step urea-assisted solution combustion method. The elemental composition and textural and structural properties of the catalysts were determined by various physical, electronic, and chemical characterization techniques. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction showed that co-doping of copper and manganese ions into the CeO2-delta lattice improved the reducibility of copper. Powder XRD, XPS, HR-TEM, and Raman spectroscopy showed that the catalysts were a singled-phased, solid-solution metal oxide with a cerium oxide cubic fluorite (cerianite) structure, and evidence of oxygen vacancies was observed. Catalytic results in the preferential oxidation of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream showed that complete CO conversion occurred between 150 and 180 degrees C. Furthermore, at 150 degrees C, Ce0.90Cu0.05Mn0.05O2-delta, Ce0.90 Cu0.10O2-delta, and Ce0.85Cu0.10Mn0.05O2-delta catalysts were the most active, achieving complete CO conversion and CO2 selectivity of 81, 79, and 71%, respectively. The catalysts performed moderately in the presence of CO2 and water, with the Ce0.90Cu0.05Mn0.05O2-delta catalyst giving a CO conversion of 80% in CO2, which decreased to about 60% when water was added.

AB Sulfoxides are key scaffolds in the synthesis of pharmaceutically active molecules. A large number of sulfoxides are indispensable ingredients in the structure of most antibiotics, biological and natural products such as Modafinil, Adrafinil, CRL-40,941 or fladrafinil, Fipronil, Oxydemetonmethyl, Omeprazole, Pantoprazole, Lansoprazole and Rabeprazole. The oxidation of sulfides is the most common and efficient strategy for the preparation of sulfoxides. Recently, many protocols based on using transition metals have been reported for the oxidation of sulfides to the sulfoxides. In this paper, we summarized a nice category of the reported protocols in the literature for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides.

   Synthesis Using Octahedral MnO2 Molecular Sieve: Catalytic
   Activity versus Method of Catalyst Synthesis
SO ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering
AB Octahedral MnO2 molecular sieve (OMS) was prepared using a hydrothermal synthesis route in the absence and the presence of urea. OMS was also prepared by a solvent-free method. Catalysts were characterized by the complementary combination of X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, UV visible spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption techniques. Catalysts were investigated in the oxidation of benzyl alcohols, hydration of aromatic/heterocyclic nitrile, and condensation reactions (Knoevenagel and Aldol). Furthermore, applicability of the catalyst was extended in one-pot tandem conversion of benzyl alcohol to 2-benzylidene-malononitrile, (E)-chalcone, and 2,3-dihydro-1,5-benzothiazepine. 2-Benzylidene-malononitrile and (E)-chalcone were prepared by a two-step tandem reaction from benzyl alcohol, whereas 2,3-dihydro-1,5benzothiazepine was prepared by a three-step tandem reaction from benzyl alcohol. Recycling study showed that no significant decrease in the catalytic activity was observed even after five recycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that shows that OMS materials obtained using different synthesis methods exhibited significant differences in their catalytic activity in the above-mentioned reactions.

TI Effects of long-term fertilization history and current N and S
   fertilizer applications on nitrous oxide production from S-deficient
   soils in a laboratory incubation
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) production in four soils with unique fertilization management histories-collected from long-term fertility treatments receiving no fertilizer, NPKS, PKS, and NPK in a 5 yr cereal-forage rotation in response to three sources of added N [100 kg N ha(-1) urea, NH4Cl, Ca(NO3)(2)] with and without co-addition of elemental S (20 kg S ha-1) plus a 0-N and 0-S control was investigated in a 7 wk laboratory incubation in a loam-textured soil at 40% water-filled pore space. In all soils, cumulative N2O emissions and apparent, cumulative, net nitrification were significantly higher following addition of urea compared with other N fertilizers with and without co-addition of elemental S. Lower N2O emissions were observed in soils without a history of long-term N fertilization following addition of urea compared with soils that had historically received urea. Because the preincubation soil total N levels were similar in soils with a history of urea application (NPKS) and without urea (PKS), the results of this investigation suggest that the higher N2O production in the NPKS soil may be the result of a priming effect and (or) changes in microbial community composition induced by long-term urea applications rather than differences in the long-term soil N balance.

TI Efficient Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst with wide active temperature window for
   NH3 selective catalytic reduction of NO: Synergistic effect
   of isolated Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> and Fe2O3
SO JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB The influence of preparation conditions (urea as precipitant, H-2 reduction, and air passivation) on the catalytic performance and mechanism of Fe-ZSM-5 for NH3 selective catalytic reduction of NO was systematically investigated to understand the effect of iron species in depth. An appropriate molar ratio of urea addition to Fe-ZSM-5 prepared in a mixed solvent formed a large amount of Fe2O3, which increased the low-temperature activity. H-2 reduction transformed some Fe2O3 into elemental Fe, which weakened the inhibiting effect of NH3. It showed more than 90% NO conversion at 125 degrees C, but the loss of active components and Bronsted acid sites caused deteriorating high-temperature performance. Air passivation generated some isolated Fe3+ and adsorbed oxygen species on the surface, which resulted in similar low-temperature activity as a hydrogen-reduced catalyst. Moreover, the regenerated Fe2O3 caused more NH4+ to combine with Bronsted acid sites, which maintained excellent high-temperature performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of Ultraviolet Light Irradiation on Silk Fibroin Films Prepared
   under Different Conditions
SO BIOMOLECULES
AB Silk fibroin (SF)-based materials are exposed to both natural and artificial ultraviolet (UV) light during preparation or administration. However, the effects of UV irradiation on SF films prepared under different conditions have not yet been described in detail. In this study, four SF films with different molecular weight (MW) distribution were fabricated using SF solutions, which were prepared by dissolving degummed SF for 0.5-24 h. We observed UV (365 nm) irradiation on SF films induced the increase of yellowness and absorbance at 310 nm of SF films, indicating the formation of new photo-products and di-tyrosine bonds by photo-oxidation. Due to di-tyrosine cross-links between SF chains, UV-irradiated SF films were not fully dissociated in urea solution. In addition to formation of new products, UV reduced the crystallinity of SF films by breaking hydrogen bonds of beta-sheet conformation. Unlike the UV-induced decomposition of physical interactions, UV did not affect the covalent bonds (i.e., peptide bonds). Through these experiments, we could expect that SF with higher MW was more susceptible and SF with lower MW was more resistant to UV-induced photo-oxidation and photo-degradation. These results provide useful information about UV-induced aging of SF-based materials under natural sunlight and UV irradiating conditions.

TI The pH effect on the kinetics of 4-nitrophenol removal by CWPO with
   doped carbon black catalysts

AB P, B and N-doped carbon blacks prepared with H3PO4, urea and H3BO3 were tested as catalysts in the wet peroxide oxidation of a concentrated 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) model solution (C4-NP = 5 g center dot L-1). The highest catalytic activity was found for P-doped carbon black (complete removal of 4-NP after 4 h at 80 degrees C, C-cat = 2.5 g center dot L-1, C-H2O2 17.8 g center dot L-1 and initial pH 3, whereas 44-19% removals were reached with the other catalysts). That was ascribed to the strongest acidity (pH(PZC) = 3.5) and hydrophilic character of the catalyst. Initial pH affected the oxidation, allowing to increase strongly the conversion of 4-NP with the P-doped catalyst decreasing the initial pH from 4 to 2 (4-NP removal from 20% to 99% after 8 h of reaction time at 50 degrees C, C-cat = 2.5 g center dot L-1 and CH2O2 17.8 g center dot L-1). An autocatalytic-power-law kinetic model was developed to predict the observed induction period and the dependence on the pH of the 4-NP oxidation, H2O2 consumption and pH evolution (k(4-NP) = 2.2 center dot 10(-5)M(-2)min(-1), kH(2)O(2) = 4.0 center dot 10(-6) M-3 center dot min(-1) and k(H+) = 5.1 center dot 10(-3) M-0.23 min(-0.23) at 80 degrees C).

TI High-performance electrochemical amperometric sensors for the sensitive
   determination of phenyl urea herbicides diuron and fenuron
SO IONICS
AB We have described the fabrication of high-performance amperometric sensors derived from graphene oxide-multiwalled carbon nanotube (GO-MWCNT) composite for the sensitive determination of diuron and fenuron. GO-MWCNT composite was prepared by simple solution-based approach, and its formation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy methods. GO-MWCNT film-modified glassy carbon electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in the oxidation of diuron and fenuron in terms of less overpotential and highly enhanced peak currents. GO-MWCNTs have presented significantly improved electrocatalytic performance than dimethylformamide-dispersed MWCNTs. GO-MWCNT-based amperometric sensor has been fabricated which detects diuron in wide linear range between 9 mu M and 0.38 mM with high sensitivity of 0.645 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2). The amperometric sensor also detects fenuron in broad linear range between 0.9 and 47 mu M with sensitivity of 1.20 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2). Moreover, the sensor offers appreciable repeatability, reproducibility, and stability results. Practical feasibility of the prepared amperometric sensor has been assessed in various water samples collected from agricultural areas.

TI Acidic pH promotes oxidation-induced dissociation of C-reactive protein
SO MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY
AB Background: Circulating levels of the systemic inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP) have been associated with increased risk and poor outcomes of many diseases, such as cardiovascular events and cancer. Accumulating evidence has indicated that the conformational rearrangement of human pentameric CRP (pCRP) to monomeric CRP (mCRP) is a prerequisite for participation in the pathogenesis. Therefore, determining the mechanism of the dissociation of pCRP into pro-inflammatory mCRP under physiological/pathological circumstances has been intriguing.
   Methods: The effects of oxidative and acidic stress occurring in inflammation on pCRP were examined by electrophoresis, electron microscopy, protein fluorescence, neoepitope expression and endothelial cell responses.
   Results: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the copper-hydrogen peroxide system could rapidly induce the dissociation of CRP at mild acidic pH within four hours, but not at physiological pH of 7.4. Meanwhile, mannitol, a ROS scavenger, could not protect against dissociation, which implied that local ROS from accessible histidine residues may be crucially beneficial to the formation of mCRP in a redox-balanced microenvironment. Furthermore, mCRP generated by ROS could be reduced by DTT, which indicated the exposure of functional motif aa35-47, and showed potent proinflammatory actions on endothelial cells, comparable to mCRP generated by urea.
   Conclusion: dissociation of pCRP to mCRP could be rapidly induced by ROS from copper-hydrogen peroxide system in dependence on mildly acidic stress regardless of a redox-balanced microenvironment.

TI In Situ Modulation of A-Site Vacancies in LaMnO3.15
   Perovskite for Surface Lattice Oxygen Activation and Boosted Redox
   Reactions
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Modulation of A-site defects is crucial to the redox reactions on ABO(3) perovskites for both clean air application and electrochemical energy storage. Herein we report a scalable one-pot strategy for in situ regulation of La vacancies (V-La) in LaMnO3.15 by simply introducing urea in the traditional citrate process, and further reveal the fundamental relationship between V-La creation and surface lattice oxygen (O-latt) activation. The underlying mechanism is shortened Mn-O bonds, decreased orbital ordering, promoted MnO6 bending vibration and weakened Jahn-Teller distortion, ultimately realizing enhanced Mn-3d and O-2p orbital hybridization. The LaMnO3.15 with optimized V-La exhibits order of magnitude increase in toluene oxidation and ca. 0.05 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) increase of half-wave potential in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The reported strategy can benefit the development of novel defect-meditated perovskites in both heterocatalysis and electrocatalysis.

TI Knife-injected anhydrous ammonia increases yield-scaled N2O
   emissions compared to broadcast or band-applied ammonium sulfate in
   wheat
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB The effect of nitrogen (N) application rate on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in grain cropping systems has been extensively studied, but little attention has been given to N source as a factor influencing emissions. To expand our understanding of the conditions that affect N2O emissions and production pathways, and develop management practices that farmers can use to maintain crop productivity while mitigating N2O emissions, we conducted field experiments during two years in wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping systems in the Sacramento Valley, California. Five levels of total N were applied, ranging from 0 to 254 in the 2009-10 season, and from 0 to 266 kg N ha(-1) in the 2010-11 season. At planting in November, either ammonium sulfate (AS) or anhydrous ammonia (AA) was applied, and either urea or calcium nitrate was used as a topdress at the stem elongation stage. The cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.24 (+/- 0.07) to 1.31 (+/- 035) kg N2O-N ha(-1) in 2009-10 and from 0.74 (+/- 0.24) to 2.2 (+/- 0.23) kg N2O-N ha(-1) in 2010-11. In both seasons, the highest total N2O and yield-scaled N2O emissions were recorded in the treatments that included 112 kg N ha(-1) as knife-injected AA. In 2010-11, the total N2O and yield-scaled N2O emissions following 168 kg N ha(-1) broadcast AS starter were similar as those of the AA treatment. Significantly higher N2O fluxes after a topdress application of 98 kg N ha(-1) urea compared to a nitrate addition of the same magnitude indicates that ammonia oxidation was likely the source of N2O production. In contrast to other studies, N use efficiency was not negatively correlated to N uptake-scaled N2O emissions, mainly because N2O emissions were a function of fertilizer type and application method.

TI Effect of the CeO2 synthesis method on the behaviour of
   Pt/CeO2 catalysis for the water-gas shift reaction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB A comparative study of three different ceria synthesis procedures (template- and MW-assisted hydrothermal synthesis and urea homogeneous precipitation) is reported in this paper. The obtained materials were employed as supports for Pt nanoparticles, and the Pt/CeO2 catalysts were evaluated in the WGS reaction under model and realistic conditions. The influence of the support, e.g., its morphology and electronic properties, has been studied in detail by means of XRD, H-2-TPR, XPS, UV-Vis spectroscopy and toluene hydrogenation (for metal dispersion assessment). The catalytic performance of the samples is directly correlated with the modification of the electronic properties, as a result of the preparation method used. The conventional homogeneous precipitation method with urea resulted to be the best option, leading to enhanced ceria reducibility and adequate Pt dispersion, which in turns resulted in a very efficient WGS catalyst.

TI Synthesis of a novel In2O3 hollow cube using

   C3H8
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB Indium oxide hollow cubes were made using a simple hydrothermal technique and calcination process, its crystalline form was cubic bixbyite-type, and had high purity of the calcined sample. Urea was selected as alkaline source, which was capable of cooperating with In3+ to create indium-urea complexes, hindering the growth of certain surfaces, further controlled the shape of the product. Comparing with In2O3 prepared with different amounts of urea, it was found that the best performing In2O3 hollow cube (In2O3-5) synthesized at a molar ratio (InCl3:CH4N2O) of 1:5, its form was a hollow cubic structure made of regular spherical particles stacked, possessed a relatively large specific surface area (64.9 m2/g) which was 1.2 times greater than In2O3-1, and it had smallest grain size (15 nm) compare with In2O3-1 (28 nm), In2O3-3 (23 nm), In2O3-8 (16 nm), and In2O3-10 (20 nm). The In2O3-5 sensor's sensitivity peaked at 180 degrees C, which is its ideal operating temperature (response value could reach 84.1), the response recovery time was 9s, also exhibited excellent selectivity for C3H8 (CO: 21.7, C2H4: 24.8, C2H5OH: 28.6, H2: 17.9 and H2S: 12.2). The results showed that In2O3-5 with a hollow cube structure formed more necessary channels for vacant oxygen species transport and further contributed to the sensitivity of the material to gases.

TI Synthesis of yttrium doped nanocrystalline ZnO and its photocatalytic
   activity in methylene blue degradation
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Yttrium doped zinc oxide was prepared by microwave irradiation of Y (NO3)(3).6H(2)O and Zn(NO3)(2).4H(2)O as precursors, in ethanol-water medium. Highly polar ethanol-water medium (30/70, v/v) with hexamine and urea assist the formation of ZnO nuclei very rapidly in a specific fashion. Furthermore, Y3+ ions infiltration into Zn(OH) 2 precipitate was facilitated by microwaves (2.45 GHz, 950 W). Yttrium doped nanocrystalline ZnO (ZnO-99 and ZnO-95) was formed with 1 and 5 mol% yttrium precursor. The powder was morphologically characterized with XRD, DLS, SEM and TEM. Photocatalytic activity of microwave treated Y3+ doped ZnO was tested by studying the oxidation of methylene blue solution in a batch reactor. The studies showed that the catalytic reaction followed second order kinetics. Based on the results obtained from photocatalytic studies, efficiencies of various ZnO samples were found to be in this order: ZnO-A > ZnO-99 > ZnO-95 > ZnO-R that is, Y3+ doped ZnO was not as effective as commercial undoped ZnO. However, ZnO-95 had shown better stability, antiphotocorrosive nature and reusability among the samples tested in this study.

TI Simple synthesis of flower-like NiCo2O4 as bifunctional electrocatalysts
   for methanol-assisted rechargeable Zn-air batteries
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Aiming at the inevitable high charging potential problem of conventional Zn-air batteries (ZABs), biomassassisted ZABs were proposed, which the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in charging was replaced by biomass oxidation reaction. In this work, flower-like NiCo2O4 was synthesized by a simple chemical bath deposition method, which exhibited more outstanding performance for ORR and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Compared with Co3O4 and NiO, the NiCo2O4 air electrode with the mass loading of 2.0 mg cm -2 displayed the highest current for ORR (-256.50 mA cm -2) and MOR (189.30 mA cm -2). Based on NiCo2O4 air electrode, the charging -discharging voltage gap of methanol -assisted ZABs was greatly reduced to 0.55 V from 0.80 V of ZABs. By analyzing the changes of air electrodes before and after the cycle, the main reasons for enhanced stability are maintained structure, avoided carbon oxidation, and maintained catalytic activity. Moreover, to further reduce the charging -discharging gap, the mass loading was increased to 4.0 mg cm -2, charging -discharging voltage gap was reduced by 41 mV, which remained basically unchanged after cycling for 200 h.

TI Hepatic actions of androgens in the regulation of metabolism
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENDOCRINOLOGY DIABETES AND OBESITY
AB Purpose of review
   The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings on hepatic actions of androgens in the regulation of protein, lipid and glucose metabolism. The rationale for liver-targeted testosterone use will be provided.
   Recent findings
   Liver-targeted testosterone administration, via the oral route, induces protein anabolic effect by reducing the rate of protein oxidation to a similar extent to that of systemic testosterone administration. Recent evidence indicates that testosterone exerts whole-body anabolic effect through inhibition of nitrogen loss via the hepatic urea cycle. Several hepatic effects of androgens, particularly on glucose metabolism, are direct and take place before any changes in body composition occur. This includes an increase in insulin secretion and sensitivity, and reduction in hepatic glucose output by testosterone. Furthermore, lack of testosterone in the liver exacerbates diet-induced impairment in glucose metabolism. In the liver, androgens induce the full spectrum of metabolic changes through interaction with growth hormone or aromatization to estradiol.
   Summary
   Liver-targeted testosterone therapy may open up a new approach to achieve whole-body anabolism without systemic side-effects. Aromatizable androgens may be superior to nonaromatizable androgens in inducing a complex spectrum of direct, estrogen-mediated and other hormone-mediated effects of androgens.

TI Advances in the greener synthesis of chromopyrimidine derivatives by a
   multicomponent tandem oxidation process
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A hydrophilic cobalt/copper heterogeneous bimetallic catalyst named mTEG-CS-Co/Cu-Schiff-base/IL was successfully synthesized from chitosan polysaccharide. The new catalyst was investigated and confirmed using various techniques including FT-IR, FE-SEM, EDX-EDS, XRD, TEM, TGA, AFM, NMR and ICP. The catalyst exhibited powerful catalyst activity for the tandem one pot oxidative chromopyrimidine reaction from benzyl alcohols under mild conditions, utilizing air as a clean source in a green protocol. The catalyst was compatible with a wide range of benzyl alcohols, and aldehydes formed in situ, and bis-aldehydes synthesized were condensed with urea/4-hydroxycumarin to provide favorable products in good yields for all derivatives (14 new derivatives). The presence of tri-ethylene glycol and imidazolium moieties with hydrophilic properties on the mTEG-CS-Co/Cu-Schiff-base/IL nanohybrid provides dispersion of the nanohybrid particles in water, leading to higher catalytic performance. Furthermore, the reaction exhibited several other notable features, including low catalyst loading, the ability to be recycled for up to 6 stages, high atom economy, a simple work procedure, short reaction time, utilization of an environmentally friendly nanohybrid, and the replacement of volatile and organic solvents with water solvent.

TI Rapid synthesis of Fe-doped
   CuO-Ce0.8Zro0.2O2 catalysts for CO
   preferential oxidation in H2-rich streams: Effect of iron
   source and the ratio of Fe/Cu
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB A facile route (urea grind combustion method) is described for the rapid synthesis of Fe-doped Cu-Ce-Zr catalysts within 30 min through simple grinding and combustion. The effects of iron source and Fe/Cu mass ratio on the performances of the catalysts for CO preferential oxidation (CO-PROX) are evaluated. The influences of H2O, CO2, and their mixture on the activity as well as stability of the catalysts are also investigated. The samples are characterized by XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption, H-2-TPR, TEM, Raman and XPS. Fe(NO3)(3) is found to be superior to Fec1(3) and Fe-2(SO4)(3) as the iron source for Fe-CuCZ catalyst. Among the different synthesized catalysts,1/10Fe(N)-CuCZ is found to be the most active catalyst, indicating that the optimal Fe/Cu mass ratio is 1/10. The influences of H2O, CO2, and H2O + CO2 on the catalytic performance of 1/10Fe(N)-CuCZ are in the order of CO2 < CO2 + H2O < H2O. 1 /10Fe((-)(N))CuCZ exhibits excellent stability during a 228 h time-on-stream test. 1/10Fe(N)-CuCZ shows the highest catalytic activity and excellent stability even in the presence of H2O and CO2. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to thesynergy between the highly dispersed copper species and ceria, as well as the formation of more oxygen vacancies and reduced copper species.

TI Hydrothermal synthesis of V2O5/TiO2 decorated graphitic carbon nitride
   nanocomposite for biomolecule oxidation inhibition and dye degradation
   applications
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Oxides of vanadium, titanium and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are well known for their catalytic activities. In order to achieve synergic catalytic effects, a novel nanocomposite (NC) i.e. V2O5/TiO2/g-C3N4 has been synthesized by a very simple, ecofriendly and nonhazardous hydrothermal method. The fabricated NC was characterized employing UV-Visible, FTIR, SEM, and XRD techniques. UV-Visible and FTIR analysis indicated the formation of the nanocomposite and XRD analysis confirmed the association of V2O5 and TiO2 with g-C3N4 in nanocomposite. SEM study indicated the hetero-structure of NC having size ranging from 50 to 80 nm and it was found having hexagonal crystallite structure. The synthesized nanocomposite exhibited excellent scavenging of free radicals DPPH? (91%) and ABTS? thorn (64%) that are responsible for the oxidation of biomolecules. Therefore, NC can be claimed having biomolecule oxidation protective potential. In addition, photocatalytic ability for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) was also achieved up to 94% and 89% respectively. The synthesized novel nanocomposite exhibited excellent potential to remove free radicals and dyes from aqueous medium which can be further used for the environmental remediation.

TI Dimethyl Methylphosphonate for the Suppression of Coal Spontaneous
   Combustion
SO COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The inhibitory effect of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) on coal spontaneous combustion was investigated. The influence of DMMP on the thermal mass loss and thermal properties in the coal oxidation process was analyzed by synchronous thermal analysis. A DMMP inhibitor concentration of 10% provided the best inhibitory effect on coal oxidation. Addition of DMMP increased the coal ignition temperature by approximately 33 degrees C, the burnout temperature by approximately 63 degrees C, and the initial exothermal temperature by approximately 12 degrees C. It also reduced the total heat release of the coal oxidation process by approximately 1200 J/g. Kinetic analysis of raw coal and DMMP-treated coal showed that DMMP exerted physical inhibition by blocking contact between coal and oxygen in the low-temperature oxidation stage. In the high-temperature oxidation stage, the chemical inhibition effect of DMMP was enhanced and the activation energy increased significantly (approximately 54.79 kJ/mol). Gas phase analysis indicated that DMMP could reduce oxygen consumption and CO emission during the coal oxidation process. On the basis of the above results and quantum chemical analysis, a mechanism for DMMP suppression of coal spontaneous combustion was proposed. This study provides reference data for prevention of coal spontaneous combustion and development of new inhibitors.

   Co3O4/Ti3C2Tx MXene
   nanocomposites for integrated all solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors
   and energy-saving electrochemical systems of H2 production by
   urea and alcohols electrolysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Co3O4/Ti3C2Tx MXene nanocomposites have been fabricated by vacuum filtration and hydrothermal-annealing methods, and their electrochemical performance were investigated for energy storage and conversion, systematically. As electrode materials, Co3O4/ Ti3C2Tx MXene nanocomposites in 6 M KOH solution demonstrated the specific capacitance of 240.1 F g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and the long-term cycle stability. The solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors exhibited an operating potential window of 1.4 V, a specific capacitance of 97.9 F g(-1)at 0.25 A g(-1), an energy density of 95.9 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 630.4 W kg(-1), and excellent long-term durability. Furthermore, the connected solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors inseries and parallels presented the promising practical applications. Besides, Co3O4/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites displayed outstanding catalytic be-haviors for energy-saving H-2 generation by urea and alcohols electrolysis. The electrolyzer in KOH + CH3CH2OH electrolyte required only 1.33 V potential to deliver the current density of 0.5 A g(-1). Especially, the elctrochemical system of H-2 production by The electrolyzer and the powered solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors based on Co3O4/Ti3C2Tx nano -composites was constructed, demonstrating outstanding properties of H2 production. Therefore, this study not only shows enormous potential of Co3O4/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites as a portable power supply but also indicates its great opportunities in energy-saving H2 production in practical applications.

TI Metabolic Flux Distribution during Defatting of Steatotic Human Hepatoma
   (HepG2) Cells
SO METABOLITES
AB Methods that rapidly decrease fat in steatotic hepatocytes may be helpful to recover severely fatty livers for transplantation. Defatting kinetics are highly dependent upon the extracellular medium composition; however, the pathways involved are poorly understood. Steatosis was induced in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) by exposure to high levels of free fatty acids, followed by defatting using plain medium containing no fatty acids, or medium supplemented with a cocktail of defatting agents previously described before. We measured the levels of 28 extracellular metabolites and intracellular triglyceride, and fed the data into a steady-state mass balance model to estimate strictly intracellular fluxes. We found that during defatting, triglyceride content decreased, while beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the urea cycle increased. These fluxes were augmented by defatting agents, and even more so by hyperoxic conditions. In all defatting conditions, the rate of extracellular glucose uptake/release was very small compared to the internal supply from glycogenolysis, and glycolysis remained highly active. Thus, in steatotic HepG2 cells, glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation may co-exist. Together, these pathways generate reducing equivalents that are supplied to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

TI Highly efficient total nitrogen and simultaneous total organic carbon
   removal for urine based on the photoelectrochemical cycle reaction of
   chlorine and hydroxyl radicals
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Urine is a major nitrogen and COD source and threatens the aqueous environment, leading to eutrophication and energy consumption. However, the conventional technologies encounter the bottleneck due to the high load of nitrogen and organics in urine. Here we propose an innovative idea for complete transformation of urea-nitrogen to N-2 and simultaneous degradation of organics to CO2 with the assistance of chlorine and hydroxyls radicals (Cl-center dot and HO center dot) in photoelectrochemical cell system. This idea reveals circulation process of these two radicals: photoexcited holes from WO3 anode oxidize chloride and hydroxyl ions to Cl-center dot and HO center dot radicals under illumination, these radicals convert urea-nitrogen to N-2 or slight nitrate, and then slight nitrate is selectively reduced to N-2 on a novel Pd/Au modified porous metallic sheet. TN analysis of a simulated urea solution of 30 mg L-1 demonstrated that N-2 and CO2 are the primary oxidation products of the urea, and the urea-N was completely stripped (99.45%) in 90 min. Meanwhile, with the detection of EPR spectrum, organics can be transformed to CO2 by OH center dot in this cyclic system. Significantly, the feasibility of actual urine treatment was also investigated, indicating great denitrification efficiency (99.37%) and TOC removal efficiency (50.91%), respectively. This work sheds light upon a new economical, efficient, and environment-friendly means of urine sewage treatment. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Electrochemical features of tetracycline oxidation on mechanoactivated
   g-C3N4/PrFeO3 nanocomposites
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB In this work, efficient and environmentally friendly electrocatalysts based on 2D nanocrystals of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) decorated with praseodymium orthoferrite (PrFeO3) nanoparticles were designed and synthesized for the efficient electrocatalytic treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. Nanocrystalline g-C3N4 was obtained through the thermal polymerization of urea in air. Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) was employed for producing PrFeO3. Subsequently, the nanopowders underwent ethanol-assisted mechanochemical treatment using a planetary ball mill. As a result, a series of samples was obtained with the PrFeO3 content ranging from 0 to 100 wt%. The resulting nanocomposites were dispersed in a solution of isopropyl alcohol with the addition of 0.5% Nafion; thereafter, the suspensions were applied to an ITO glass substrate to form electroactive thin films. The series underwent analysis using an X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, surface area and porosity analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The influence of the g-C3N4 to PrFeO3 ratio on the electrochemical activity during the decomposition of tetracycline hydrochloride was analyzed. Consequently, an optimal ratio was determined, leading to the rapid and complete decomposition of the antibiotic in a neutral aqueous environment. In conclusion, it should be noted that the process of electrocatalytic decomposition of tetracycline hydrochloride has been comprehensively studied.

TI L-Carnitine enhances exercise endurance capacity by promoting muscle
   oxidative metabolism in mice
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB L-Carnitine (LC), the bioactive form of carnitine, has been shown to play a key role in muscle fuel metabolism during exercise, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure. However, whether LC contributes to improved endurance exercise performance remains controversial. This study was designed to investigate the effects of LC administration on endurance capacity and energy metabolism in mice during treadmill exercise. Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups (sedentary and exercise) and received daily oral administration of LC (150 mg/kg) or vehicle with a high-fat diet for 3 weeks. During the experimental period, all animals were trained three times a week on a motorized treadmill, and the total running time until exhaustion was used as the index of endurance capacity. LC administration induced a significant increase in maximum running time with a reduction of body fat compared with the control group when mice were subjected to programmed exercise. The serum levels of triglyceride, non-esterified fatty acid, and urea nitrogen were significantly lower in the LC group than the corresponding levels in the control group, while serum ketone body levels were higher in the LC group. Muscle glycogen content of LC administered-mice was higher than that of control mice, concomitant with reduced triglyceride content. Importantly, muscle mRNA and protein expressions revealed enhanced fatty acid uptake and oxidative metabolism and increased mitochondrial biogenesis by LC administration. These results suggest that LC administration promotes fat oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis while sparing stored glycogen in skeletal muscle during prolonged exercise, resulting in enhanced endurance capacity.

TI One step synthesis of oxygen doped porous graphitic carbon nitride with
   remarkable improvement of photo-oxidation activity: Role of oxygen on
   visible light photocatalytic activity
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB A novel metal-free oxygen doped porous graphitic carbon nitride (OA-g-C3N4) was synthesized by condensation of oxalic acid and urea. The 40% OA-g-C3N4 catalyst can degrade bisphenol A (15 mg L-1) in 240min with a mineralization rate as high as 56%. The Markedly higher visible-light-driven oxidation activity of OA-g-C3N4 is attributed to the porous morphology and unique electrical structure. The porous structure of DA-g-C3N4 provides more active sites for adsorption and degradation of pollutants. Moreover, oxygen atoms in the tri-s-triazine units help to extend sufficient light absorption range up to 700nm, improve the separation of charge-carriers and alter the position of valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB). The VB edge shifts from 1.95 eV to 2.46 eV due to the incorporation of O atoms, which leads to the change of active species in the photocatalytic reaction. Trapping experiment shows that superoxide radicals play the major role in the photocatalytic degradation of BPA on g-C3N4, while hydroxyl radical is the dominant active species in the photocatalytic degradation process over 40% OA-g-C3N4. This study presents a simple, economical and environment-friendly method to synthesized oxygen doped porous graphitic carbon nitride. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Emissions of Nitrous Oxide, Methane and Ammonia After Field Application
   of Digested and Dewatered Sewage Sludge With or Without Addition of Urea
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB Purpose By recycling sewage sludge (SS) to productive land, its plant nutrients can be utilised. However, the use of organic fertilisers carries health risks and causes emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3). One measure to sanitise SS from human pathogens is addition of NH3.
   Methods Mesophilically digested and dewatered SS treated with urea and stored, or only stored, was applied to arable land in spring and autumn, respectively, and the effects of immediate or delayed incorporation (by 4 h) on emissions of N2O, CH4 and, in spring, NH3 were investigated.
   Results N2O emissions in autumn from soil treated with SS were significantly higher than from soil without SS application (0.09, 1.31 and 0.68 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for control, immediate and delayed incorporation, respectively). These emissions were significantly correlated with volumetric water content in soil. Corresponding N2O emissions in spring were 0.15, 0.57 and 0.41 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Delayed incorporation (0.20 and 0.34 % of added N in spring and autumn, respectively) tended to reduce N2O emissions compared with immediate incorporation (0.32 and 0.71 % of added N in spring and autumn, respectively). Nitrous oxide emissions from SS were apparently lower after spring than after autumn application, likely because of drier soil and crop uptake of nitrogen in spring. Methane emissions were negative or negligible. Timing of incorporation had no statistically significant effect on NH3 emissions.
   Conclusions Nitrous oxide emissions from soil treated with SS at a rate based on the maximum permissible P level were moderate and CH4 emissions negligible.

TI Antimyeloperoxidase antibody is a biomarker for progression of diabetic
   retinopathy
SO JOURNAL OF DIABETES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS
AB Aim: To study the correlation between serum antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody levels with severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR).
   Methods: Study subjects included 60 consecutive cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM): no diabetic retinopathy (NODR, n = 20); nonproliferative DR (NPDR, n = 20); proliferative DR (PDR, n = 20) and 20 healthy controls. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured on logMAR scale. Serum anti-MPO antibody levels were evaluated using ELISA IgG kit. Serum urea and creatinine was measured using standard protocol. Data were analysed statistically.
   Results: Mean serum anti-MPO antibody (RU/ml) was 16.94 +/- 4.85 in controls, 17.66 +/- 4.78 in NODR, 21.51 +/- 5.27 in NPDR and 37.27 +/- 11.92 in PDR groups. On ANOVA, significant difference in visual acuity was found among the study groups (F = 73.46, p < 0.001). Serum anti-MPO antibody was correlated significantly with decrease in visual acuity (F = 48.40, p < 0.001), increase in serum urea (F = 128.13, p < 0.001) and creatinine (F = 77.10, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Increase in serum anti-MPO antibody levels correlate with increased severity of DR. Serum anti-MPO antibody may be a noteworthy biochemical marker for progression of retinopathy from nonproliferative to proliferative stage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   oxovanadium and dioxomolybdenum complexes with ONO tridentate Schiff
   base ligand
SO POLYHEDRON
AB For the first time, two new oxovanadium and dioxomolybdenum Schiff base complexes, VOL(OMe) and MoO2L, were synthesized through the reaction of a ONO tridentate Schiff base ligand (H2L) derived from the condensation of 5-bromosalicylaldehyde and nicotinic hydrazide with oxo and dioxo acetylacetonate salts of vanadium and molybdenum, [VO(acac)(2) and MoO2(acac)2], respectively. The synthesized ligand and complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques like FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, elemental analysis (CHN) and the most authentic single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (SC-XRD). The geometry around the central metal ion in MoO2L was distorted octahedral as revealed by the data collected from diffraction studies. Non-covalent interactions that are responsible for crystal packing are explored by Hirshfeld surface analysis. Theoretical calculations of the synthesized compounds, carried out by DFT at B3LYP/Def2-TZVP level of theory, indicated that the calculated results are in agreement with the experimental findings. Moreover, the catalytic activities of both complexes were investigated for the selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols using urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in acetonitrile. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The investigation of influencing factors on the degradation of
   sulfonamide antibiotics in iron-impregnated biochar-activated
   urea-hydrogen peroxide system: A QSAR study
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Iron-impregnated biochar-activated urea-hydrogen peroxide (FB-activated UHP) is a potential in-situ technology for simultaneously reducing soil sulfonamide antibiotic contaminants and improving soil fertility. To better understand the degradation of sulfonamide antibiotics by FB-activated UHP, a two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) model based on quantum chemical parameters and a three-dimensional QSAR (3D-QSAR) model based on molecular force field were developed to investigate the factors influencing the removal efficiencies (Re%). The optimal 2D-QSAR model was Re%= 0.858-8.930 E-5 E-B3LYP-0.175 f(+)(x) with the evaluation indices of R-2 = 0.732, q(2) = 0.571, and Q(ext)(2)= 0.673. The given 2D-QSAR model indicated that the molecular size (E-B3LYP) and Fukui index with respect to nucleophilic attack (f( + )) were intrinsic factors influencing Re%. Three degradation pathways were subsequently proposed based on the f(+) distribution. Compared to the 2D-QSAR model, the developed 3D-QSAR model exhibited a better predictive ability, with the evaluation indices of R-2 = 0.989, q(2) = 0.696, and SEE= 0.001. The analysis of field contribution rates suggested that electrostatic field (48.2%), hydrophobic field (25.3%), and hydrogen-bond acceptor field (12.7%) were the main factors influencing Re%. These findings generated critical information for evaluating the degradation mechanisms/rules and provided theoretical bases for initially estimating the Re% of sulfonamide antibiotics undergoing FB-activated UHP process.

TI Bifunctional Ni Foam Supported
   TiO2@Ni3S2 core@shell Nanorod Arrays
   for Boosting Electrocatalytic Biomass Upgrading and H2
   Production Reactions
SO SMALL
AB Replacing traditional oxygen evoltion reaction (OER) with biomass oxidation reaction (BOR) is an advantageous alternative choice to obtain green hydrogen energy from electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a novel of extremely homogeneous Ni3S2 nanosheets covered TiO2 nanorod arrays are in situ growth on conductive Ni foam (Ni/TiO2@Ni3S2). The Ni/TiO2@Ni3S2 electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability for both BOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Especially, taking glucose as a typical biomass, the average hydrogen production rate of the HER-glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) two-electrode system reached 984.74 mu mol h(-1), about 2.7 times higher than that of in a common HER//OER two-electrode water splitting system (365.50 mu mol h(-1)). The calculated power energy saving efficiency of the GOR//HER system is about 13% less than that of the OER//HER system. Meanwhile, the corresponding selectivity of the value-added formic acid produced by GOR reaches about 80%. Moreover, the Ni/TiO2@Ni3S2 electrode also exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity on a diverse range of typical biomass intermediates, such as urea, sucrose, fructose, furfuryl alcohol (FFA), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and alcohol (EtOH). These results show that Ni/TiO2@Ni3S2 has great potential in electrocatalysis, especially in replacing OER reaction with BOR reaction and promoting the sustainable development of hydrogen production.

TI Corrosion and biocompatibility behaviours of microarc oxidation/phytic
   acid coated magnesium alloy clips for use in cholecystectomy in a rabbit
   model
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB With the popularisation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, ligation clips have been commonly used for ligating the cystic duct and cystic artery. However, non-degradable clips remain in the body long-term, which significantly increases the risk of the clip becoming detached. Thus, magnesium alloys have attracted tremendous attention owing to their biodegradability and good biocompatibility. However, the poor corrosion resistance hinders the clinical application of magnesium alloys with microarc oxidation/phytic acid (MAO/PA) composite coatings as protective coatings. Here, these alloys were used to hinder the rapid material degradation in aqueous solution. Electrochemical tests were conducted to evaluate the in vivo degradation behaviour in simulated body fluid (SBF) for Mg-Zn-Y-Nd alloys, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the micromorphology of in vivo clip degradation. Cell toxicity, cell adhesion, and flow cytometry were performed in vitro to detect cytocompatibility. Biochemical detection of serum magnesium, serum creatinine (CREA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alanine aminotransferase (AST), and haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of the heart, liver, and kidney tissues in vivo was conducted to determine the biocompatibility properties after surgery. Electrochemical measurements and SEM images revealed that the MAO/PA-coated magnesium alloy delayed corrosion in SBF. The apoptosis rate increased slightly with increased extract concentration. Nevertheless, MAO/PA-coated magnesium alloys still exhibited good cytocompatibility. No obvious abnormality was observed in the blood biochemical test or HE staining. Thus, MAO/PA-coated magnesium alloys exhibit better corrosion than bare magnesium. In addition, Mg-Zn-Y-Nd and MAO/PA-coated magnesium alloys exhibited no cytotoxicity, good adhesion, and biosafety.

TI Influence of Surface Chemistry of Carbon Nanofibers on the
   Hydrodechlorination of Chloroform to Olefins
SO CATALYSTS
AB Functionalized carbon nanofibers (CNF) are fascinating materials to be used as supports in Pd-based catalysts for the treatment of waste chloroform (TCM) to produce light olefins through the catalytic hydrodechlorination (HDC). The CNF were functionalized by HNO3, HCl, and urea. Compared to the Pd supported on un-treated CNF, all the catalysts using functionalized CNF as support showed lower turnover frequency values with higher stability, owing to their smaller Pd nanoparticles (NPs). These smaller Pd NPs are formed due to the stronger metal-support interactions promoted by the higher concentration of surface groups on the functionalized catalysts. Since the smaller Pd NPs could hinder the hydrogenation of olefins to paraffins, the selectivity to olefins increased on the functionalized catalysts. Moreover, the N-doped CNF was successfully formed on the catalyst functionalized by urea. Since the nitrogen functional groups (pyridinic N and pyrrolic N) could provide much stronger metal-support interactions compared to the oxygen functional groups on the other catalysts, the catalyst functionalized by urea showed the smallest Pd NPs among the four catalysts, leading to the highest selectivity to light olefins.

TI Oxidation of micropollutants by visible light active graphitic carbon
   nitride and ferrate(VI): Delineating the role of surface delocalized
   electrons
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB The treatment of recalcitrant micropollutants in water remains challenging. Ferrate(VI) ((FeO42-)-O-VI, Fe(VI)) has emerged as a green oxidant to oxidize organic molecules, however, its reactivity with recalcitrant micropollutants are sluggish. Our results demonstrate enhanced oxidation of carbamazepine (CBZ) by three types of visible light-responsive graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalyst in absence and presence of ferrate(VI) ((FeO42-)-O-VI, Fe(VI)) under mild alkaline conditions. The g-C3N4 photocatalysts were prepared by thermal process using urea, thiourea, and melamine and were named as CN-U, CN-T, and CN-M, respectively. The degradation efficiency of CBZ, in both visible light-g-C3N4 and visible light-g-C3N4-Fe(VI)O(4)(2-)systems followed the order of CN-U > CN-T > CN-M. The mechanisms for this trend was elucidated by measuring physiochemical properties of the microstructures with various surface and analytical techniques. Results suggest the dominating role of specific surface area and surface delocalized electrons of microstructures in degrading CBZ. Crystallinity, morphology, and surface functional groups may not directly associate with CBZ degradation. The CN-U has higher specific surface area and surface delocalized electrons than CN-T and CN-M and therefore the highest degradation efficiency of CBZ. The surface electrons likely generated O(2)(- )and O-1(2) in the visible light-g-C3N4 system. The additional oxidants, FeV and FeIV in the visible light-g-C3N4- (FeO42-)-O-VI system led to higher degradation efficiency than the visible light-g-C3N4 system. Results suggest that the surfaces of g-C3N4 may be prepared preferentially with high levels of delocalized electrons at the surface of microstructures to enhance degradation of micropollutants.

TI Efficient treatment of actual glyphosate wastewater via non-radical
   Fenton-like oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Compared to radical oxidative pathway, recent research revealed that non-radical oxidative pathway has higher selectivity, higher adaptability and lower oxidant requirement. In this work, we have designed and synthesized Cu2O/Cu nanowires (CuNWs), by pyrolysis of copper chloride and urea, to selectively generate high-valent copper (CuIII) upon H2O2 activation for the efficient treatment of actual glyphosate wastewater. The detailed characterizations confirmed that CuNWs nanocomposite was comprised of Cu0 and Cu2O, which possessed a nanowire-shaped structure. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, in situ Raman spectra, chro-noamperometry and liner sweep voltammetry (LSV) verified CuIII, which mainly contributed to glyphosate degradation, was selectively generated from CuNWs/H2O2 system. In particular, CuI is mainly oxidized by H2O2 into CuIII via dual-electron transfer, rather than simultaneously releasing OH center dot via single electron transfer. More importantly, CuNWs/H2O2 system exhibited the excellent potential in the efficient treatment of actual glyphosate wastewater, with 96.6% degradation efficiency and chemical oxygen demand (COD) dropped by 30%. This novel knowledge gained in the work helps to apply CuNWs into heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction for environmental remediation and gives new insights into non-radical pathway in H2O2 activation.

TI The consequences of niche and physiological differentiation of archaeal
   and bacterial ammonia oxidisers for nitrous oxide emissions
SO ISME JOURNAL
AB High and low rates of ammonium supply are believed to favour ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), respectively. Although their contrasting affinities for ammonium are suggested to account for these differences, the influence of ammonia concentration on AOA and AOB has not been tested under environmental conditions. In addition, while both AOB and AOA contribute to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil, N2O yields (N2O-N produced per NO2--N generated from ammonia oxidation) of AOA are lower, suggesting lower emissions when AOA dominate ammonia oxidation. This study tested the hypothesis that ammonium supplied continuously at low rates is preferentially oxidised by AOA, with lower N2O yield than expected for AOB-dominated processes. Soil microcosms were supplied with water, urea or a slow release, urea-based fertiliser and 1-octyne (inhibiting only AOB) was applied to distinguish AOA and AOB activity and associated N2O production. Low ammonium supply, from mineralisation of organic matter, or of the fertiliser, led to growth, ammonia oxidation and N2O production by AOA only, with low N2O yield. High ammonium supply, from free urea within the fertiliser or after urea addition, led to growth of both groups, but AOB-dominated ammonia oxidation was associated with twofold greater N2O yield than that dominated by AOA. This study therefore demonstrates growth of both AOA and AOB at high ammonium concentration, confirms AOA dominance during low ammonium supply and suggests that slow release or organic fertilisers potentially mitigate N2O emissions through differences in niche specialisation and N2O production mechanisms in AOA and AOB.

TI Type 2 Diabetes Metabolic Improvement After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass May
   Include a Compensatory Mechanism That Balances Fatty Acid β and ω
   Oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF PARENTERAL AND ENTERAL NUTRITION
AB Background More than half of patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) can experience type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission, but the systemic and gastrointestinal (GI) metabolic mechanisms of this improvement are still elusive. Methods Paired samples collected before and 3 months after RYGB from 28 women with obesity and T2D were analyzed by metabolomics with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Samples include plasma (n = 56) and biopsies of gastric pouch (n = 18), gastric remnant (n = 10), duodenum (n = 16), jejunum (n = 18), and ileum (n = 18), collected by double-balloon enteroscopy. Results After RYGB, improvements in body composition and weight-related and glucose homeostasis parameters were observed. Plasma-enriched metabolic pathways included arginine and proline metabolism, urea and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles, gluconeogenesis, malate-aspartate shuttle, and carnitine synthesis. In GI tissue, we observed alterations of ammonia recycling and carnitine synthesis in gastric pouch, phenylacetate metabolism and trehalose degradation in duodenum and jejunum, ketone bodies in jejunum, and lactose degradation in ileum. Intermediates molecules of the TCA cycle were enriched, particularly in plasma, jejunum, and ileum. Fluctuations of dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) were relevant in several metabolomic tests, and metabolite alterations included aminomalonate and fumaric, malic, oxalic, and succinic acids. The product/substrate relationship between these molecules and its pathways may reflect a compensatory mechanism to balance metabolism. Conclusions RYGB was associated with systemic and GI metabolic reprogramming. DCA alterations link omega and beta fatty acid oxidation to homeostatic mechanisms, including TCA cycle improvement.

TI A lowly populated, transient β-sheet structure in monomeric
   Aβ<SUP>1-42</SUP> identified by multinuclear NMR of chemical
   denaturation
SO BIOPHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Chemical denaturation is a well-established approach for probing the equilibrium between folded and unfolded states of proteins. We demonstrate applicability of this method to the detection of a small population of a transiently folded structural element in a system that is often considered to be intrinsically fully disordered. The H-1(N), N-15, C-13(alpha), and C-13' chemical shifts of A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) peptides and their M35-oxidized variants were monitored as a function of urea concentration and compared to analogous urea titrations of synthetic pentapeptides of homologous sequence. Fitting of the chemical shift titrations yields a 10 +/- 1% population for a structured element at the C-terminus of A beta(1-42) that folds with a cooperativity of m = 0.06 kcal/mol.M. The fit also yields the chemical shifts of the folded state and, using a database search, for A beta(1-42) these shifts identified an antiparallel intramolecular beta-sheet for residues I32-A42, linked by a type I' beta-turn at G37 and G38. The structure is destabilized by oxidation of M35. Paramagnetic relaxation rates and two previously reported weak, mediumrange NOE interactions are consistent with this transient beta-sheet. Introduction of the requisite A42C mutation and tagging with MTSL resulted in a small stabilization of this beta-sheet. Chemical shift analysis suggests a C-terminal beta-sheet may be present in A beta(1-40) too, but the turn type at G37 is not type I'. The approach to derive Transient Structure from chemical Denaturation by NMR (TSD-NMR), demonstrated here for A beta peptides, provides a sensitive tool for identifying the presence of lowly populated, transiently ordered elements in proteins that are considered to be intrinsically disordered, and permits extraction of structural data for such elements.

TI Enzyme activities distinguish long-term fertilizer effects under
   different soil storage methods
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB Long-term nitrogen fertilization imparts significant effects on the soil environment and soil microbial communities relevant to nutrient cycling. Understanding the complex interactions between soil biology, management practices, and the soil environment is an important step toward improving soil health. The Crop Residue study of the Long-Term Plots at Pendleton, Oregon USA demonstrate declines in soil quality with acidification and reduced soil carbon under a wheat-fallow cropping system. Soil enzyme activity (beta-glucosidase, 13-glucosaminidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, arylsulfatase, and arylamidase) and ammonia oxidation was measured in plots managed with three different fertilizer treatments (no fertilization, urea-ammonium nitrate, and manure) at two stages of crop growth. The fertilizer treatments had a strong impact on total carbon and nitrogen and produced a broad range of soil pH from 4.8 (urea-ammonium nitrate) to 5.7 (no fertilizer) and 6.7 (manure). Overall, potential nutrient cycling activity (hydrolytic enzymes and ammonia oxidation) was enhanced in manure-fertilized soils except for acid phosphatase which was greater in the low pH soil. Treatment trends in the proportional geometric mean (an index of soil nutrient cycling capacity) were generally consistent over a 32-year transect excluding acid phosphatase. All activities were highly correlated to total carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Except for beta-glucosaminidase, all enzymes were also highly correlated to pH. The only enzyme to vary by crop phase was beta-glucosidase which was greater at boot than tillering. Soils remaining after the analyses were oven dried at 40 degrees C and stored in a non-climate-controlled warehouse for archiving. After 2-years of storage, the oven dried soils were re-assessed for hydrolytic enzyme activity to determine whether the ability to distinguish treatment differences is retained in archived soils. The oven-dried archived samples showed similar contrasts as the soils analyzed moist between manure and the other fertilizer treatments, although the level of activity was significantly reduced. Overall, long-term fertilization with manure slowed the decline in soil acidity and enhanced soil function relevant to nutrient cycling and organic matter dynamics in the wheat-fallow cropping system.

TI Removal rates and energy demand of the electrochemical oxidation of
   ammonia and organic substances in real stored urine
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB The separate collection and treatment of urine allows for an environmentally friendly and cost-efficient management of the nutrients contained in urine. The primary goal should be to recover all these nutrients. However, in some cases it will be economically or ecologically more sensitive to recover only the phosphorus, while nitrogen is removed together with organic substances (measured as chemical oxygen demand, COD) and pathogens. In this study, we investigated the use of galvanostatic electrolysis for the removal of nitrogen and COD from real stored urine. Non-active type boron-doped diamond (BDD) and active type thermally decomposed iridium oxide film (TDIROF) anodes were evaluated using batch experiments. On both anodes, ammonia was exclusively removed by indirect oxidation with active chlorine (AC: Cl-2, HClO, and ClO-). As a consequence, ammonia was not completely removed, if chlorine was consumed by competing processes. While COD was present, ammonia removal was faster on TDIROF (227 +/- 16 gN m(-2) d(-1) at 20 mA cm(-2)) than on BDD (43 perpendicular to 20 gN m(-2) d(-1) at 20 mA cm(-2)). The reason for the slower ammonia removal on BDD was the enhanced reaction of AC with organic molecules. In fact, hydroxyl radicals broke organic molecules down to shorter chain molecules which reacted with most of the AC leaving only little AC for the oxidation of ammonia. This preferential oxidation of organics resulted in very high COD removal rates on BDD (above 420 gCOD m(-2) d(-1) at 20 mA cm(-2) for COD concentrations above 1000 mgCOD L-1). A main drawback of electrolysis with both anodes was the high energy demand (BDD: 55 W h gCOD(-1) and 766 W h gN(-1) for 90% and 6% removal, respectively. TDIROF: 67 W h gCOD(-1) and 77 W h gN(-1) for 30% and 40% removal. All at 20 mA cm(-2)). It can be concluded that BDD and TDIROF anodes could be combined in series for a fast, complete, and more energy efficient electrochemical urine treatment: COD could be removed on BDD before the residual ammonia would be removed on TDIROF.

TI Exposed {001} facet of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals in
   Ag/TiO2 catalysts for boosting catalytic soot combustion: The
   facet-dependent activity
SO JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB Herein, the nanocatalysts of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) coated on anatase TiO2-n% nanocrystals with co-exposed {1 0 1} and {0 0 1} facets were elaborately constructed by the urea-induced hydrothermal method. The ratios (n%) of exposed {001} facet in TiO2 nanocrystals are adjusted in the range of 8-79%. Ag/TiO2-n% catalysts exhibited excellent the exposed {0 0 1} facet-dependent catalytic activity during soot combustion. Ag/TiO2-79% catalyst shows the highest catalytic activity (T-50 = 364 degrees C, TOF = 0.174 h(-1) at 310 degrees C) and the lowest apparent activation energy (84 kJ mol(-1)). Combination insitu Raman spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the catalytic mechanism is proposed: the active sites locate at the interface between Ag and {0 0 1} facet of TiO2-n% nanocrystal, and the synergy effect of coordinatively unsaturated Ti-5c and adjacent Ag atoms boosts the key step of O-2 activation. It highlights an effective strategy to develop high-efficient catalysts by the crystal facet engineering of metal oxides during oxidation reaction. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Design of earth-abundant amorphous transition metal-based catalysts for
   electrooxidation of small molecules: Advances and perspectives
SO SUSMAT
AB Electrochemical oxidation of small molecules (e.g., water, urea, methanol, hydrazine, and glycerol) has gained growing scientific interest in the fields of electrochemical energy conversion/storage and environmental remediation. Designing cost-effective catalysts for the electrooxidation of small molecules (ESM) is thus crucial for improving reaction efficiency. Recently, earth-abundant amorphous transition metal (TM)-based nanomaterials have aroused souring interest owing to their earth-abundance, flexible structures, and excellent electrochemical activities. Hundreds of amorphous TM-based nanomaterials have been designed and used as promising ESM catalysts. Herein, recent advances in the design of amorphous TM-based ESM catalysts are comprehensively reviewed. The features (e.g., large specific surface area, flexible electronic structure, and facile structure reconstruction) of amorphous TM-based ESM catalysts are first analyzed. Afterward, the design of various TM-based catalysts with advanced strategies (e.g., nanostructure design, component regulation, heteroatom doping, and heterostructure construction) is fully scrutinized, and the catalysts' structure-performance correlation is emphasized. Future perspectives in the development of cost-effective amorphous TM-based catalysts are then outlined. This review is expected to provide practical strategies for the design of next-generation amorphous electrocatalysts.

TI Nitrosospira cluster 3-like bacterial ammonia oxidizers and
   Nitrospira-like nitrite oxidizers dominate nitrification activity
   in acidic terrace paddy soils
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The isolation of acid-adapted ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) has suggested the functional importance of AOB in acidic soils. However, there is, currently, no convincing evidence that links AOB activity to nitrification in acidic paddy soils. Here we demonstrated the incorporation of (CO2)-C-13 into the genomes of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), AOB and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) following urea application by using stable isotope probing (SW) in three acidic terrace paddy soils with altitudes of 200 m (E200), 600 m (E600) and 1100 m (E1100), respectively. Nitrification activity increased from E200 to E600 and then to E1100, accompanied with significant growth of AOB over the 56-day incubation, while the abundance of archaeal arnoA gene declined significantly in all soils after incubation. DNA-SIP demonstrated that active AOB outnumbered AOA and were much more heavily labeled than AOA and NOB, implying their more significant contributions to nitrification in these soils. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Nitrosospira cluster 3-like AOB predominantly catalyzed bacterial ammonia oxidation. C-13-labeled NOB was dominated by Nitrospira moscoviensis in E1100, while in E200 and E600, Nilrospira marina and Nitrospira japonica were as prevalent as Nitrospira moscoviensis, respectively. Canonical correlation analysis and the Mantel test indicated the importance of soil physiochemical properties (e.g., pH, available phosphorus (AP) and soil oxidation capacity (OXC)) in determining the composition of the active nitrifying populations. These results suggest a greater functional importance of AOB in ammonia oxidation in the tested acidic paddy soils and the existence of a broader ecological niche for AOB than previously considered.

   electrocatalyst for sensitive and selective nonenzymatic glucose
   detection
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB The detection of glucose plays a significant role in diagnostics and management of diabetes and it is thus desired to develop non-noble-metal electrocatalyst for nonenzymatic glucose sensing. This work demonstrates the first use of monolithically integrated copper phosphide nanowire on copper foam (Cu3P NW/CF) as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical oxidation of glucose. As a nonenzymatic glucose sensor, this Cu3P NW/CF exhibits a low detection limit of 0.32 mu M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 with a linear range from 0.005 to 1 mM (R-2 = 0.997). It also shows high anti-interference property to other normally co-existing electroactive species including lactose, fructose, ascorbic acid, uric acid, urea, dopiamine, and sucorse as well as excellent resistance to chloride poisoning. Its application for glucose detection in human serum sample is also demonstrated successfully. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Polarization Engineering of Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Highly
   Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Molecular Oxygen and
   Water
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Two-electron oxygen photoreduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is seriously inhibited by its sluggish charge kinetics. Herein, a polarization engineering strategy is demonstrated by grafting (thio)urea functional groups onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), giving rise to significantly promoted charge separation/transport and obviously enhanced proton transfer. The thiourea-functionalized CTF (Bpt-CTF) presents a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic H2O2 production rate to 3268.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts that is over an order of magnitude higher than unfunctionalized CTF (Dc-CTF), and a remarkable quantum efficiency of 8.6% at 400 nm. Mechanistic studies reveal the photocatalytic performance is attributed to the prominently enhanced two-electron oxygen reduction reaction by forming endoperoxide at the triazine unit and highly concentrated holes at the thiourea site. The generated O-2 from water oxidation is subsequently consumed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thereby boosting overall reaction kinetics. The findings suggest a powerful functional-groups-mediated polarization engineering method for the development of highly efficient metal-free polymer-based photocatalysts.

TI Removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria by electrolysis with diamond
   anodes: A pretreatment or a tertiary treatment?
SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB In the present work, the influence of the water matrix on the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria during the electro-disinfection with diamond anodes was studied, paying special attention to the disinfection efficiency and the prevention of the formation of hazardous disinfection by-products. This will allow to evaluate if electrolysis is more suitable as pretreatment of the main pollution source or as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater. To do this, electrolysis of synthetic wastewater rich in ammonium (simulating the effluent of an oxidation pond) and hospital urine intensified with three different bacteria (E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli) were carried out. Results show that the disinfection efficiency is higher in the synthetic wastewater for all the bacteria tested, but chlorate is formed as disinfection by-product. Electrogenerated hypochlorite and chloramines are the main responsible species for bacteria depletion. Presence of organics (urea, creatinine and uric acid) as additional ammonia precursors in hospital urine leads to the well-known breakpoint reaction with electrogenerated active chlorine, yielding an increasing concentration of chloramines. This helps to prevent the formation of chlorate in hospital urine because hypochlorite is mainly wasted in the oxidation of organics and the formation of chloramines. These results are of a great significance because they indicate that antibiotic resistant bacteria can be efficiently removed in complex matrixes without the formation of hazardous chlorine by-products if it is carried out as a pretreatment before discharge to WWTP.

TI Alternative energy production pathways in Taenia crassiceps
   cysticerci in vitro exposed to a benzimidazole derivative (RCB20)
SO PARASITOLOGY
AB Biochemical studies of benzimidazole derivatives are important to determine their mode of action and activity against parasites. The lack of antihelminthic alternatives to treat parasitic infections and albendazole resistance cases make the search for new antiparasitary drugs of utmost importance. The 6-chloro-5-(1-naphthyloxy)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-benzimidazole (RCB20) is a benzimidazole derivative with promising effect. This study evaluated the effect of different concentrations of RCB20 in the alternative energetic pathway of in vitro Taenia crassiceps cysticerci. The parasites were in vitro exposed to 6.5 and 13 mu M of RCB20 and albendazole sulfoxide (ABZSO). The quantification of acetate, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, fumarate and propionate was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The quantification of urea, creatinine and total proteins was performed by spectrophotometry. The increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate reflects the enhancement of the fatty acid oxidation in the treated groups. Volatile fatty acids secretion, acetate and propionate, was increased in the treated groups. The secretion mechanisms of the treated parasites were impaired due to organic acids increased concentrations in the cysticerci. It is possible to conclude that the metabolic effect on alternative energetic pathways is slightly increased in the parasites treated with RCB20 than the ones treated with ABZSO.

TI Anti-corrosion and self-healing coatings with polyaniline/epoxy
   copolymer-urea-formaldehyde microcapsules for rusty steel sheets
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Polyaniline (PANI)/Epoxy copolymer as a core material was synthesized via a chemical oxidation method. Various analytical techniques, including scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, were used to characterize the morphology, compositions, and self-healing and anticorrosion properties of the prepared microcapsules and coatings. The prepared PANI/Epoxy copolymer showed the best electrochemical corrosion resistance when the ratio of PANI to epoxy was 0.05: 1 (wt.:wt.). For the mass fraction of the core (PANI/Epoxy copolymer) of 60.84 +/- 0.06 wt%, the mean particle diameter of the prepared microcapsules was 4.20 +/- 0.92 mu m. The coatings with 15 wt% microcapsules possessed excellent self-healing performance and corrosion resistance. The low-frequency impedance modulus at 0.01 Hz of scratched coatings immersed in the NaCl solution for 24 h was 5.27 x 106 Omega.cm(2). Scratched self-repairing coating samples were able to resist corrosion for 384 h; thus, the microcapsules can be used to significantly extend the service life of the coatings. Microcapsule-containing PANI/Epoxy copolymers are expected to find use in anticorrosion coating systems, where the coatings could be applied directly on rusty steel surfaces. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI S100B Protein but Not 3-Nitrotyrosine Positively Correlates with Plasma
   Ammonia in Patients with Inherited Hyperammonemias: A New Promising
   Diagnostic Tool?
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Individuals with inherited hyperammonemias often present developmental and intellectual deficiencies which are likely to be exaggerated by hyperammonemia episodes in long-term outcomes. In order to find a new, systemic marker common to the course of congenital hyperammonemias, we decided to measure the plasma level of S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), which is associated with cerebral impairment. Further, we analyzed three mechanistically diverged but linked with oxidative-nitrosative stress biochemical parameters: 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), a measure of plasma proteins' nitration; advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), a measure of protein oxidation; and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, a measure of anti-oxidative enzymatic capacity. The plasma biomarkers listed above were determined for the first time in congenital hyperammonemia. Also, the level of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (i.e., IL-12, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-10) and chemokines (IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, and RANTES) were quantified. S100B was positively correlated with plasma ammonia level, while noticeable levels of circulating 3-NT in some of the patients' plasma did not correlate with ammonia concentration. Overall, the linear correlation between ammonia and S100B but not standard oxidative stress-related markers offers a unique perspective for the future identification and monitoring of neurological deficits risk-linked with hyperammonemia episodes in patients with inherited hyperammonemias. The S100B measure may support the development of therapeutic targets and clinical monitoring in these disorders.

TI Impact of nitrogen fertilizer source on nitrous oxide (N2O)
   emissions from three different agricultural soils during freezing
   conditions
SO TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY
AB Nitrogen (N) application is the main agricultural management that increases nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration in the atmosphere. Freezing conditions are common phenomenon in the northern China that significantly affect soil N2O emissions through alterations in nutrients availability and microbial population. To develop a comprehensive understanding of how N fertilizer managements affect soil N2O emissions during the freezing process, a lab incubation was conducted in three typical cultivated soils (black soil, fluvo-aquic soil, or loess soil) by adding different N fertilizer sources, including ammonium chloride, sodium nitrate, or urea at different N levels (0, 80, 200, or 500 mg N/kg) at the start of freezing. The N2O emissions in the fluvo-aquic soil were significantly higher than in other soils. The application of nitrate in the fluvo-aquic soil promoted N2O emissions by five-and seven-fold higher compared to ammonium chloride and urea, whereas N2O emissions in black soil were enhanced by application of ammonium chloride. Data indicate that denitrification is the major pathway for N2O production in the fluvo-aquic soil during the freezing process, while ammonia oxidation responses accounts for elevated N2O production in black soil. No significant influence of N fertilizer levels on N2O emissions were found during soil freezing. These results suggest that agricultural practices that focus on mitigation of N2O emissions need to avoid selection of nitrate as N fertilizer source in fluvo-aquic soil prior to the freezing season. Future studies need to focus on how the expression of enzymes and/or shifts in microbial communities respond to different N fertilizers during freezing conditions.

TI Nickel Vacancies Boost Reconstruction in Nickel Hydroxide
   Electrocatalyst
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Because the reconstruction of catalysts is generally observed during oxidation reactions, understanding the intrinsic structure-related reconstruction ability of electrocatalysts is highly desirable but challenging. Herein, a controllable hydrolysis strategy is developed to obtain nickel hydroxide electrocatalysts with controllable nickel vacancy (V-Ni) concentrations, as confirmed by advanced spectroscopic characterization. Electrochemical measurements show that the reconstruction can be promoted with the increase of V-Ni concentration to generate true active components, thereby boosting activities for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the increased V-Ni, concentration yields decreased formation energies of the true active components during reactions. This work provides fundamental understanding of the reconstruction ability of electrocatalysts in anodic oxidation reactions from the view of intrinsic defects.

TI Sol-gel one-pot synthesis of efficient and environmentally friendly
   iron-based catalysts for NH3-SCR
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB In current study, various pore-forming agents were employed for the synthesis of Fe-W-Ti catalysts via sol-gel one-pot approach, and the catalytic performance was investigated for selective catalytic reduction of NOx by ammonia (NH3-SCR). Among all the catalysts, Fe0.2W0.2Ti(U-0.03, urea-modification) catalyst exhibited more than 95% NOx conversion in range of 240-420 degrees C, and excellent performance of resistance to SO2 and H2O was observed with a slight decline of NOx conversion to 92%. The characterization results revealed that urea-modified catalyst possessed low crystallinity of TiO2 with particle size of 3.8 nm and the dispersion of Fe-W species was increased significantly, which could be ascribed to the high specific surface area (144.92 m(2)/g) and superior porous structure. The sufficient strong acid, the remarkable reducibility and the increase in the ratio of divalent iron & adsorbed oxygen may be responsible for the excellent catalytic activity. Moreover, a dramatic drop in the specific surface area and surface acidity of the hydrothermal aged catalyst was observed, and the active species also became agglomerated with FeWO4 solid solution.

TI Novel dual-enzyme system for synthesis of 2-alkyl and 2-arylbenzoxazoles
   via aerobic oxidation
SO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB This study reports a strategy involving biocatalysis to form 2-alkylbenzoxazoles and 2-arylbenzoxazoles specifically via the urease-artificial Vitreoscilla hemoglobin metalloenzyme (ArVHbM)-catalyzed cascade reaction of urea, catechols, and aldehydes. In this system, ArVHbM and urease not only function as catalysts for the crucial initial reactions they also ensure the controllable in situ generation of ammonia to avoid its accumulation and thus prevent its possible toxic effects. The enzymatic method has a wide substrate scope (26 examples) and a green process (water as solvent and air as oxidant) and is superior to known chemical oxidant methods involving the NaIO4-NH4OAc system. In addition, we evaluate the value of porphyrin ligand substitution as a strategy to tune and enhance the catalytic properties of hemoproteins in non-natural reactions.

TI Novel Synthesis and Characterization Studies of Spinel
   NixCo1-xAl2O4
   (x=0.0 to 1.0) Nano-Catalysts for the Catalytic Oxidation of
   Benzyl Alcohol
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Ni-doped cobalt aluminate NixCo1-xAl2O4 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) spinel nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by a simple microwave combustion method using urea as the fuel and as well as reducing agent. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was confirmed the formation of single phase, cubic spinel cobalt-nickel aluminate structure without any other impurities. Average crystallite sizes of the samples were found to be in the range of 18.93 nm to 21.47 nm by Scherrer's formula. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral analysis was confirmed the corresponding functional groups of the M-O, Al-O and M-Al-O (M = Co and Ni) bonds of spinel NixCo1-xAl2O4 structure. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images was confirmed the particle like nanostructured morphology. Energy band gap (E-g) value was calculated using UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and the E-g values increased with increasing Ni2+ dopant from x = 0.2 (3.58 eV) to x = 1.0 (4.15 eV). Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) measurements exposed that undoped and Ni-doped CoAl2O4 samples have superparamagnetic behavior and the magnetization (M-s) values were increased with increasing Ni2+ ions. Spinel NixCo1-xAl2O4 samples has been used for the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde and was found that the sample Ni0.6Co0.4Al2O4 showed higher conversion 94.37% with 100% selectivity than other samples, which may be due to the smaller particle size and higher surface area.

TI Intensification of anodic charge transfer by contaminant degradation for
   efficient H2 production
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Hydrogen (H-2) production from electrocatalytic water splitting is at present limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Breakthroughs in low overpotential and stable anodic reactions are urgently needed to complement the rapid advancements in H-2 production. Using nickel (Ni)-based catalysts as an example, we intensified charge transfer on a nickel phosphide (Ni2P) anode for efficient H-2 production using substitution of contaminant degradation for the OER. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy, we confirmed that a decreased two-electron-transfer pathway was responsible for the superior formate oxidation, whereas the formation of the desired oxidation state of Ni-III accounted for the efficient urea degradation. Both scenarios were beneficial for accelerating charge transfer across the interface between the anode and electrolyte, thus achieving high H-2 production efficiency at low voltage. A voltage of only 1.40 V supported currents of 12.5 and 6.0 mA in urea- and formate-containing solutions, respectively, which reached 150 and 60 mA after the voltage was increased to 1.70 V, several times higher than that under basic conditions.

TI A Facile Self-Templated Approach for the Synthesis of Pt Hollow
   Nanospheres with Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB In this work, the well-defi ned Pt hollow nanospheres with the rough porous surface are synthesized by a facile self-templated approach. The formation of the spherical Pt(II)-urea complex plays a key role in the generation of Pt hollow nanospheres. Sodium formate is employed as the suitable reducing agent for reducing Pt(II)-urea complexes. The hollow structure and the rough porous surface with abundant atomic defects are confi rmed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The CO-stripping experiment reveals that these abundant atomic defects effectually enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt hollow nanospheres for the CO oxidation reaction. Moreover, the low activation energy of the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) on the Pt hollow nanospheres indicates that the hollow structure and the rough porous surface are benefi cial kinetically for the EOR in alkaline media. Compared with commercial Pt black, the as-prepared Pt hollow nanospheres show the enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability for the EOR in alkaline media. In view of the enhanced catalytic activity and the facile self-templated approach, the Pt hollow nanospheres may be a new promising electrocatalyst for alkaline direct ethanol fuel cells.

TI Kinetic modeling of thermal degradation of TDI/MDI-based flexible
   polyurethane foam under nitrogen and air atmospheres with Shuffled
   Complex Evolution algorithm: Insights from TG-FTIR analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS
AB This study investigates the thermal degradation mechanisms and kinetics of TDI/MDI-based flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) under nitrogen and air atmospheres, employing thermogravimetric (TG) analysis in conjunction with TG-FTIR technique. The information gleaned from these analysis is used to construct kinetic model based on model-free approaches coupled with the Shuffled Complex Evolution optimization algorithm. The results uncovered the five-step complex thermal degradation process of TDI/MDI-based FPUF compared to TDI-based or MDI-based polyurethane in both atmospheres. In nitrogen atmosphere, this involve the dissociation of TDI- and MDI-based urethane bonds, breakage of recombined urea bonds, random chain scission of polyol, and further degradation of incompletely pyrolyzed solid products. In air atmosphere, the process emcompasses dissociation of TDI- and MDI-based urethane linkages, accelerated oxidation of polyol chains, consumption of urea groups, and combustion of partially oxidized intermediates. This work also emphasizes the limitations of solely relying on TG tests for kinetic modeling, necessitating the integration of TG tests and TG-FTIR technique to obtain a comprehensive understanding of degradation mechanisms. The significance of the acquired insights lies in their potential to reshape the design of thermo-chemical reactors, resulting in heightened resource recovery, diminished environmental impact, and a stride towards a circular economy within the polyurethane industry.

TI Preparation of one dimensional silver nanowire/nickel-cobalt layered
   double hydroxide and its electrocatalysis of glucose
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB A novel silver nanowire/nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (AgNW/NiCo LDH) nanocomposite was successfully synthesized, after which a glucose sensor was fabricated. AgNW was synthesized by ethylene glycol as reductant in presence of Fe3+, and NiCo LDH grafted vertically along the 1D AgNW by slow hydrolysis of urea. The morphology and composition of AgNW/NiCo LDH were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The electrochemical investigation showed that the AgNW/NiCo LDH/GCE exhibited excellent electrocatalytic ability to glucose oxidation, with a linear range from 0.002 mM to 6 mM at a low applied potential of 0.4 V (vs. SCE) and a low detection limit of 0.66 mu M at the signal-to-noise ratio of 3. It is expected that the AgNW/NiCo LDH nanocomposites appear to be a promising catalyst for non-enzymatic glucose sensor.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the present work, Cu-doped nickel ferrite (CuxNi(1-x)Fe2O4) nanoparticles (CuNFNPs) were chemically fabricated by adding citric acid as a capping agent followed by combustion and calcination for acetaldehyde oxidation reaction (AOR) in KOH electrolytes. The as-prepared CuNFNPs were studied in terms of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area analyses. The morphology of CuNFNPs has sponges-structure containing irregular pores. Additionally, XRD analysis indicated that the prepared CuNFNPs have a cubic-crystals ferrite without the existence of impurities and the crystal size around 20.2 nm. The electrooxidation of acetaldehyde by the presented CuNFNPs was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in -OH media. Furthermore, the effects of -OH and acetaldehyde on the electrocatalytic performance were studied with and without Cu-doping in addition to EIS and CA studies which confirm the high-performance of CuNFNPs as an electrocatalyst for AOR.

TI Insights into Ammonia Adaptation and Methanogenic Precursor Oxidation by
   Genome-Centric Analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Ammonia released from the degradation of protein and/or urea usually leads to suboptimal anaerobic digestion (AD) when N-rich organic waste is used. However, the insights behind the differential ammonia tolerance of anaerobic microbiomes remain an enigma. In this study, the cultivation in synthetic medium with different carbon sources (acetate, methanol, formate, and H-2/CO2) shaped a common initial inoculum into four unique ammonia-tolerant syntrophic populations. Specifically, various levels of ammonia tolerance were observed: consortia fed with methanol and H-2/CO2 could grow at ammonia levels up to 7.25 g NH+-N/L, whereas the other two groups (formate and acetate) only thrived at 5.25 and 4.25 g NH+-N/L, respectively. Metabolic reconstruction highlighted that this divergent microbiome might be achieved by complementary metabolisms to maximize biomethane recovery from carbon sources, thus indicating the importance of the syntrophic community in the AD of N-rich substrates. Besides, sodium/proton antiporter operon, osmoprotectant/K+ regulator, and osmoprotectant synthesis operon may function as the main drivers of adaptation to the ammonia stress. Moreover, energy from the substrate-level phosphorylation and multiple energy-converting hydrogenases (e.g., Ech and Eha) could aid methanogens to balance the energy request for anabolic activities and contribute to thriving when exposed to high ammonia levels.

TI Investigation of the conversion mechanism of endogenous semicarbazide in
   shrimp on the amino acid level
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Semicarbazide (SEM), the metabolite of antibiotic nitrofurazone, is often used as the biomarker to determine the use of nitrofurazone. Frequent false-positive events of SEM have brought great trouble to the aquatic industry in international trade. In this paper, the situation of endogenous SEM in aquatic products was investigated, and the possible mechanism of amino acid conversion into SEM was studied by establishing a simulated oxidation system and a urea system. The results revealed the presence of endogenous SEM in the muscle tissue of shrimps, and the content of SEM ranged from 0.56 to 5.28 ng/g, which presented as Macrobrachium nipponense>Macrobrachium rosenbergii>Procambarus clarkii. The increase in SEM production of control lysine under natural oxidation conditions suggests that oxidation has an effect on the conversion of SEM. Under the action of the simulated oxidation system, the SEM of Arginine, Lysine, Citrulline and Glutamine among the 21 amino acids were increased, and the polymer azine was formed. In combination with the structure of four amino acids, it was presumed that the group of amide is a key intermediate structure for the formation of endogenous SEM. In addition, under the urea system, the content of SEM produced by amino acids increased after the addition of urea, and the concentration of urea had a significant correlation with the content of SEM. Taken together, the production of endogenous SEM in shrimps is related to amino acids and urea, and the urea cycle and other substances containing amide structures should also be considered in future explorations.

TI Metabolomic Disparities in Intraocular Fluid Across Varied Stages of
   Cataract Progression: Implications for the Analysis of Cataract
   Development
SO JOURNAL OF OCULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS
AB Introduction: The lens's metabolic demands are met through a continuous circulation of aqueous humor, encompassing a spectrum of components such as organic and inorganic ions, carbohydrates, glutathione, urea, amino acids, proteins, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water. Metabolomics is a pivotal tool, offering an initial insight into the complexities of integrated metabolism. In this investigative study, we systematically scrutinize the composition of intraocular fluid in individuals afflicted with cataracts.Methods: The investigation involved a comprehensive analysis of aqueous humor samples from a cohort comprising 192 patients. These individuals were stratified by utilizing the SPONCS classification system, delineating distinct groups characterized by the hardness of cataracts. The analytical approach employed targeted quantitative metabolite analysis using HILIC-based liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometric detection. The metabolomics data analysis was performed with MetaboAnalyst 5.0.Results: The results of the enrichment analysis have facilitated the inference that the discerned disparities among groups arise from disruptions in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, variations in tryptophan metabolism, and modifications in mitochondrial beta-oxidation of short-chain saturated fatty acids and pyrimidine metabolism.Conclusion: A decline in taurine concentration precipitates diminished glutathione activity, prompting an elevated requirement for NAD+ and instigating tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway. Activation of this pathway is additionally prompted by interferon-gamma and UV radiation, leading to the induction of IDO. Concurrently, heightened mitochondrial beta-oxidation signifies a distinctive scenario in translocating fatty acids into the mitochondria, enhancing energy production.

TI Study on Rates of NH3 Adsorption and Desorption in SCR on
   Various Engine Operation Conditions
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Aging diesel engines on the road require the development of an after-treatment system to meet current emission regulations, and a reduction in NOx (Nitrogen Oxide) is significant. The SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system is the after-treatment system for removing NOx from exhaust gas in diesel engines using NH3 (Ammonia) gas. However, the mixing and conversion process between NH3 and NOx in SCR has not been entirely clarified. That process produces NH3 slip in the catalyst surface; the NH3 slip will make the after-treatment performance worse. This study informs how the UWS (Urea Water Solution) injection controlling method can minimize the NH3 slip in the after-treatment system. For this, the NH3 adsorption and desorption rates are important factors for determining the quantity of UWS injection in the system. The NH3 adsorption rate and desorption rate in the SCR are not significantly affected by engine speed, i.e., the exhaust gas flow rate. However, as the exhaust gas temperature increased, the adsorption rate and desorption rate of NH3 in the SCR increased. Through this, the exhaust gas temperature dramatically affects the NH3 adsorption rate and desorption rate in the SCR. Therefore, if the urea water is injected based on this knowledge that the NH3 adsorption amount in the SCR decreases as the exhaust gas flow rate increases, NH3 slip can be suppressed and a high NOx reduction rate can be achieved. Therefore, if the SCR adsorption and desorption mechanisms are analyzed according to the exhaust temperature and the exhaust flow rate in this paper, it can be used as a reference for selecting an appropriate SCR when retrofitting an old diesel engine car.

TI The surface asymmetric site regulation of carbon nitride oxide enabling
   peroxymonosulfate activation for degrading tetracycline
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by the carbonaceous-based materials for degrading antibiotics is a recent emerging hotspot in water environment restoration. Herein, a triazine carbon material is prepared by urea thermal condensation follwed by water-mediated oxidation. The optimized triazine carbon material (CNOR15) can degrade around 100 % of tetracycline within 6 mins, thus pseudo-first-order kinetic constant (kobs) enhances approximately 49 folds compared to pristine carbon material. Experiments and characterizations demonstrate non-radical reactive species of 1O2 plays a crucial role in CNOR15/PMS system to eliminate tetracycline, in which performs at an asymmetric C = O site on the edge of triazine motief. Electron paramagnetic resonance and trapping tests comfirm the novel mechanism of electron conduction from sp/sp2-hybrdized triazine to C = O prompting PMS decomposition for 1O2 generation. Ex-situ argon sputtering XPS technology solidly unveils a underlysing linear corelation between catalysis activity and content of carbonyl-constructed assymetric sites. In addition, membranoid CNOR15/PVDF removes ca. 90 % tetracycline at a rate of 100 mL & sdot;min 1 in a continuous flow-cell device, exhibiting a promising application in the practical wastewater purification. Our work emphasized a significance of asymmetric site regulation of carbonaceous materials towards PMS activation for environmental remediation.

TI Mechanistic Insights into the Ceria-Catalyzed Synthesis of Carbamates as
   Polyurethane Precursors
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB The methoxycarbonylation of toluenediamines with dialkyl carbonates constitutes an alternative route for the phosgene-free production of isocyanate precursors. Despite the remarkable catalytic activity of ceria in the reaction, achieving full selectivity and long-term stability still represent major challenges. Here, the mechanism of the methoxycarbonylation of the industrially relevant 2,4-diaminotoluene (2,4-TDA) with dimethylcarbonate (DMC) along with the evolution of the property-performance interplay upon consecutive cycles are rationalized via the identification of reaction products, characterization tools, and density functional theory (DFT). The formation of the desired carbamates (7% mono- and 83% biscarbamate) is favored over the (111) facet, the most abundant in the as-prepared material, and proceeds via a complex reaction mechanism that involves a broad number of isomers and multiple reaction paths. A consecutive reaction in which 2,4-TDA is converted into a monocarbamate that further reacts to the biscarbamate drives the selective path. Part of these carbamates reacts to form productive ureas, unprecedented intermediates that reversely transform into carbamates. A full product analysis enables us to identify a number of side products that mostly comprises N-methylated carbamates and N-methylated ureas. Evaluation in subsequent cycles evidences the catalyst deactivation and the concomitant increase in the formation of byproducts, which is linked to the increasing amount of carbon deposits along with the DMC-induced partial surface restructuring into an oxygen-defective (100) facet after six cycles. These findings highlight the challenges in the rational design of robust heterogeneous catalysts for the production of isocyanate precursors.

TI Fabrication of hydrophobic Fe-based metal-organic framework through
   post-synthetic modification: Improvement of aqueous stability
SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Synthesis of aqueous steady metal-organic frameworks is a critical issue to expand their photocatalyst applications in water treatment. In the current study, MIL-101(Fe)-NH2 was selected as the template, and grafting of 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl isocyanate was achieved by a postsynthetic modification method. As a result, a novel MIL-101(Fe)-1-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)urea (named MIL-101(Fe)-TfmPU) was fabricated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the grafting of amino groups to form urea groups. Water contact angle of MIL-101 (Fe)-TfmPU reached 151 degrees, implying a superhydrophobicity. Introduction of carbamido-benzene-trifluoromethyl arm reduced the surface energy, and it may act as a shield for the coordination bonds between Fe core and ligands due to its steric hindrance. This raising hydrophobicity resulted in a significant improvement on water stability. After 7 d water exposure, MIL-101(Fe)-TfmPU possessed better stability with less Fe ion release and highly intact structure compared to its parent MIL-101(Fe)-NH2. In the photocatalysis reaction with visible light and oxidant donor (H2O2), MIL-101(Fe)-TfmPU demonstrated a high degradation efficiency of cipmfloxacin with a reaction rate at 0.0636 min(-1). The dominant reaction mechanism was OH center dot oxidation. Acid condition was benefitcial for this photocatalysis reaction and its stability, while room temperature variation (278-318 K) had a negligible effect. In different actual water mediums, photocatalysis efficiency, crystal structure and chemical bonds of MIL-101(Fe)-TfmPU were all retained. Generally, the water stability of MIL-101(Fe)-TfmPU was successfully enhanced to ensure its photocatalysis applications in the aqueous mediums.

TI Oxidative digestion of dissolved N-compounds by the UV/O3
   process: Kinetic models and rate constants
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL KINETICS
AB In this study, the reaction mechanisms and kinetic of UV/O-3 digestion processes were explored with ammonium chloride and urea as the target pollutants, focused on the ozone direct oxidation and hydroxyl radical oxidation parts. Under the conditions of dual environmental digestion method, two kinds of kinetic models were proposed by competitive kinetic method with R-ct based on the different scale of rate constants of hydroxyl radical oxidation. Subsequently, the second-order rate constants of ammonia (pH 11) and urea (pH 2) was determined to be 4.613 +/- 0.094 and 0.378 +/- 0.006 M-1 s(-1) by ozone direct oxidation, and (6.154 +/- 0.971) x 10(7) and (2.257 +/- 0.513) x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) by hydroxyl radical oxidation, respectively. Compared with contribution level of two parts to the digestion process, it was shown that in the digestion of ammonia, ozone and center dot OH radical contribute equally (58.86%, 41.14%). In contrast, in the case of urea, ozone (86.10%) contributes more than center dot OH radical.

TI Synergistic Interfacial and Doping Engineering of Heterostructured
   NiCo(OH)x-CoyW as an Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen
   Evolution Electrocatalyst
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB To achieve high efficiency of water electrolysis to produce hydrogen (H-2), developing non-noble metal-based catalysts with considerable performance have been considered as a crucial strategy, which is correlated with both the interphase properties and multi-metal synergistic effects. Herein, as a proof of concept, a delicate NiCo(OH)(x)-Co-y W catalyst with a bush-like heterostructure was realized via gas-template-assisted electrodeposition, followed by an electrochemical etching-growth process, which ensured a high active area and fast gas release kinetics for a superior hydrogen evolution reaction, with an overpotential of 21 and 139 mV at 10 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively. Physical and electrochemical analyses demonstrated that the synergistic effect of the NiCo(OH)(x)/Co-y W heterogeneous interface resulted in favorable electron redistribution and faster electron transfer efficiency. The amorphous NiCo(OH)(x) strengthened the water dissociation step, and metal phase of CoW provided sufficient sites for moderate H immediate adsorption/H-2 desorption. In addition, NiCo(OH)(x)-CoyW exhibited desirable urea oxidation reaction activity for matching H-2 generation with a low voltage of 1.51 V at 50 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the synthesis and testing of the NiCo(OH)(x)-CoyW catalyst in this study were all solar-powered, suggesting a promising environmentally friendly process for practical applications.

TI A benzimidazole derivative (RCB15) in vitro induces the
   alternative energetic metabolism and glycolysis in Taenia
   crassiceps cysticerci
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB The emergence of resistance to albendazole has encouraged the search for effective alternatives for cysticercosis and other parasitosis treatment. RCB15 is a benzimidazole derivative that may be used against such diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro effect of RCB15 on the alternative energetic pathways of Taenia crassiceps cysticerci. The cysticerci were in vitro exposed to albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO) or RCB15 at different concentrations during 24 h. The cysticerci extract and the culture medium were analyzed through spectrophotometry and high performance liquid chromatography as to detect glucose, urea, creatinine and organic acids of the energetic metabolism. The drugs did not influence the protein catabolism. Fatty acids oxidation was enhanced through significantly higher acetate concentrations in the groups treated with RCB15 and ABZSO. Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were decreased which indicates the use of fatty acids towards acetyl-CoA synthesis. There was a decrease in glucose uptake and pyruvate concentrations. The absence of lactate indicates the use of pyruvate in gluconeogenesis. Therefore it is possible to conclude that RCB15 enhanced the alternative energetic pathways of cysticerci in vitro exposed to different concentration, with emphasis on the fatty acids catabolism.

TI Roles of Cobalt-Coordinated Polymeric Perylene Diimide in Hematite
   Photoanodes for Improved Water Oxidation
SO SMALL
AB Interfacial charge recombination is a permanent issue that impedes the photon energy utilization in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, a conjugated polymer, urea linked perylene diimide polymer (PDI), is introduced to the designation of hematite-based composite photoanodes. On account of its unique molecule structure with abundant electronegative atoms, the O and N atoms with lone electron pairs can bond with Fe atoms at the surface of Zr4+ doped alpha-Fe2O3 (Zr:Fe2O3) and thus establish charge transfer channels for expediting hole separation and migration. Meanwhile, PDI molecules can passivate the surface states in Zr:Fe2O3, which is in favor of suppressing carrier recombination. Particularly, Co2+ is used to coordinate with PDI (Co-PDI) to accelerate hole extraction as well as utilization, and the as-obtained Co-PDI form type-II heterojunction with Zr:Fe2O3. Such a photoanode configuration takes advantage of the unique molecule structure of PDI, and the target Co-PDI/Zr:Fe2O3 photoanodes eventually attain a photocurrent density of 2.17 mA cm(-2), which is inspirational for unearthing the potential use of conjugative molecules in PEC fields.

TI Effect of the degree of muscle oxidation on sticking and degradation of
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layers in electrolytic chromium coated
   steels
SO JOURNAL OF COATINGS TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH
AB The sticking of postmortem salmon to the container wall surface protected by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer was evaluated. The study focused on the effects of biochemical changes of postmortem salmon on the coating and how muscle degradation inside the food can, resulting from the thermal treatment and storage, favor sticking to the food container. The experimental design consisted of a set of manufactured food cans stored for up to fourteen months which were submitted to chemical and physical tests of food-contact canning to evaluate the sticking, and to treatment with urea solution to minimize the amount of muscle residues. The characterization of changes in the multilayer was performed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The degradation of the muscle-polymer system was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared, Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. The results showed the existence of denatured muscle proteins firmly sticking to the PET surface over time and the adverse effects of urea leading to chemical changes and molecular rearrangements in the polymer coating altering its functionality as a protective layer in canned salmon, limiting thereby the potential use of PET as a recyclable input in other applications.

TI An audit of newborn screening procedure: Impact on infants presenting
   clinically before results are available
SO MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM
AB Background and objective: Tandem mass spectrometry-based newborn screening (NBS) is a powerful screening tool. The NBS process includes sample collection, shipment, testing, analysis, reporting and communication with the infant's family. We explored the NBS programme-related factors that may delay diagnosis and may influence timely initiation of treatment in neonates who present before the screening results are available and therefore urgently need diagnosis and treatment.
   Study design: Detailed retrospective review of all data regarding sampling, shipment, testing and notification, contact with family and initiation of treatment of all neonates with disorders of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and protein metabolism (PM), who presented clinically before NBS results were available, between 1-February-2002 and 31-January-2014.
   Results: Of 847,418 newborns screened, 18 infants presented clinically before NBS results were available (FAO n = 9, median age 2.5 days; PM n = 9, median age 3 days). Samples were collected from 11 infants at age 48-72 h, as per instructions, and were received in the laboratory at a median age of 7 days (median 4 days from sample collection until receipt in the laboratory). Results were available within 24 h in 16/18 infants. Treatment for a suspected metabolic disorder was initiated in seven infants before results were available.
   Conclusions: An audit of the programme procedures enabled the identification of issues that can be improved. Some patients benefited from the availability of results shortly after presentation. Good communication between the laboratory, the clinical metabolic specialist service and the primary treating team ensures timely initiation of treatment in these infants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Silica-bonded vanadic acid [SiO2-VO(OH)(2)] (SVA) efficiently catalyzed the synthesis of 1,2-dihydro-1-aryl-3H-naphth[1,2-e][1,3]oxazin-3-ones via reacting aromatic aldehydes and beta-naphthol and urea under solvent-free condition. Additionally, 2,4,6-triarylpyridine derivatives were prepared through the condensation of ammonium acetate, aromatic aldehyde and various acetophenone in the presence of a catalytic amount of [SiO2-VO(OH)(2)] (SVA) under a same condition. A new anomeric based oxidation was proposed for the final step of the 2,4,6-triarylpyridine derivatives synthesis which was supported by theoretical studies. So the described new mechanistic approach can open up a new and promising insight in the course of rational design, synthesis and applications of novel hydride releasing compounds. The significant features of the present procedure are short reaction time, high yields, easy work-up, and recyclability of the SVA catalyst.

   Friendly Organic Cotton Fibers as a New Activated Carbon Fiber Precursor
SO FIBERS AND POLYMERS
AB Organic cotton precursor yarn was impregnated in an aqueous solution consisting of diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP), boric acid (BA), and urea (U) mixtures before the thermal stabilization stage and then subjected to heat treatments in an air environment at 245 degrees C. The effect of chemical pretreatment on organic cotton yarn was examined using methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The XRD analysis revealed a gradual decrease in the crystalline structure, attributed to the disruption of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. DSC and TGA measurements showed an improved thermal stability due to the formation of pre-graphitic structures with aromatic entities at higher temperatures. For samples chemically impregnated and then stabilized, the char yield values increased from 25% to 68% at 500 degrees C and 23% to 53% at 1000 degrees C. Analysis of IR spectra indicated a gradual reduction in both intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds associated with dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions. The IR spectra also confirmed a decrease in crystallinity with increasing oxidation time, which is consistent with the findings from X-ray diffraction. In addition, the IR spectra showed the presence of C = C bonds, indicating the formation of a crosslinked ladder-like structure. The results showed that DAP-BA-U integration increased the thermal stability of organic cotton fibers and the obtained samples were ready for the next stage, carbonization.

   with small gold nanoparticles for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen
   evolution
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Small plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)-decorated with TiO2 nanosheets were fabricated to improve the photocatalytic performance. The Au/TiO2 nanosheets with Au NPs of different sizes ranging from similar to 3 nm to 28 nm were prepared by using hydrothermally obtained TiO2 nanosheets as substrate via urea and light reduction method. During synthesis, the obtained Au NPs through urea reduction treatment in different calcination temperatures possessed smaller size (similar to 3-13 nm) than those of the light reduction method (similar to 28 nm). The introduced Au NPs were tightly loaded on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets through in situ growth reduction process of chloroauric acid. The emergence of smaller Au NPs promoted the photocatalytic performance over Au/TiO2 nanosheets. The as-prepared Au/TiO2 nanosheets with small Au NP sizes of similar to 3-5 nm showed the highest photocatalytic rate of hydrogen production (similar to 230 mu mol.h(-1)) under xenon lamp illumination, exceeding more than twice that of Au/TiO2 nanosheets with loading of larger Au NPs (similar to 28 nm). The favorable constituents and combination of Au/TiO2 nanosheets provided large surface adsorptive sites for reactant adsorption, introduced plasmonic effects and formed Schottky barrier junction via surface plasmon resonance. The Schottky barrier height was lower due to the presence of smaller Au NPs, thereby enhancing the charge separation through the Schottky transfer hub to neighboring TiO2 nanosheets. The synergistic effect between the plasmonic hot carrier-driven Au NPs and TiO2 nanosheets was discussed. The photocatalytic mechanism was also proposed for the fabrication of visible light restricted photocatalysts with smaller Au NPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of different modeling methods toward predictive capability
   evaluation of the bonding strength of wood laminated products
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART E-JOURNAL OF
   PROCESS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB The main aim of this study is usability evaluation of different approaches, including response surface methodoloy, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and artificial neural network models to predict and evaluate the bonding strength of glued laminated timber (glulam) manufactured using walnut wood layers and a natural adhesive (oxidized starch adhesive), with respect to this fact that using the modified starch can decrease the formaldehyde emission. In this survey, four variables taken as the input data include the molar ratio of formaldehyde to urea (1.12-1.52), nanocellulose content (0%-4%, based on the dry weight of the adhesive), the mass ratio of the oxidized starch adhesive to the urea formaldehyde resin (30:70-70:30), and the press time (4-8 min). In order to find the best predictive performance of each selected evaluation approach, different membership functions were used. The optimal results were obtained when the molar ratio, nanocellulose content, mass ratio of the oxidised starch, and press time were set at 1.22, 3%, 70:30, and 7 min, respectively. Based on the performance criteria including root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) obtained from the modeling of response surface methodology, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference network, and artificial neural network, it became evident that response surface methodology could offer a better prediction of the response with the lowest level of errors. Beside, artificial neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system support the response surface methodology approach to evaluate bonding strength response with high precision as well as to determine the optimal point in fabrication of laminated products.

TI Progress in metal-organic frameworks for small molecule oxidative
   coupled hydrogen production
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The electrochemical oxidation reactions of small molecules present a lower theoretical thermodynamic potential in comparison to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and can serve as a viable alternative, concurrently generating value-added compounds or facilitating pollutant degradation. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant attention due to their adjustable properties, abundant active sites, and wide porosity in recent years. In comparison with conventional electrocatalysts, MOF-based electrocatalysts exhibit superior performance in the field of small molecule oxidation. A comprehensive review of synthesis methods and stra-tegies for enhancing the electrochemical properties of MOF-based electrocatalysts has been provided, focusing on their applications in small molecule oxidation coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Further-more, we address the current challenges and prospects to promote the development of more efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts for water splitting assisted by small molecule oxidation.

TI Single cell genomic and transcriptomic evidence for the use of
   alternative nitrogen substrates by anammox bacteria
SO ISME JOURNAL
AB Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) contributes substantially to ocean nitrogen loss, particularly in anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Ammonium is scarce in AMZs, raising the hypothesis that organic nitrogen compounds may be ammonium sources for anammox. Biochemical measurements suggest that the organic compounds urea and cyanate can support anammox in AMZs. However, it is unclear if anammox bacteria degrade these compounds to ammonium themselves, or rely on other organisms for this process. Genes for urea degradation have not been found in anammox bacteria, and genomic evidence for cyanate use for anammox is limited to a cyanase gene recovered from the sediment bacterium Candidatus Scalindua profunda. Here, analysis of Ca. Scalindua single amplified genomes from the Eastern Tropical North Pacific AMZ revealed genes for urea degradation and transport, as well as for cyanate degradation. Urease and cyanase genes were transcribed, along with anammox genes, in the AMZ core where anammox rates peaked. Homologs of these genes were also detected in meta-omic datasets from major AMZs in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific and Arabian Sea. These results suggest that anammox bacteria from different ocean regions can directly access organic nitrogen substrates. Future studies should assess if and under what environmental conditions these substrates contribute to the ammonium budget for anammox.

TI Nanostructure Design and Catalytic Performance of Mo/ZnAl-LDH in
   Cationic Orchid X-BL Removal
SO MATERIALS
AB The nanostructure of ZnAl-layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-LDH) was designed to promote the catalytic performance of Mo-based ZnAl-LDH (Mo/ZnAl-LDH) catalysts, in a catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) process, under room temperature and pressure, in degradation of dye wastewater. Four most commonly used preparation methods, traditional precipitation (TP), hydrothermal synthesis (HS), sol-gel (SG), and urea co-precipitation (UC) were employed to prepare the ZnAl-LDH. The resulting Mo/ZnAl-LDH samples were contrasted through surface area, crystal structure, chemical state, and morphology. The degradation of cationic orchid X-BL, under room temperature and pressure, was developed to determine the catalytic activity of these Mo/ZnAl-LDH samples. The results showed that the nanostructure of ZnAl-LDH, prepared by HS, enhanced the adhesion of the catalytic active component, thus Mo/ZnAl-LDH had the highest catalytic activity of 84.2% color removal efficiency and 73.9% total organic carbon removal efficiency. Specific Mo species, such as Na2Mo2O7, Mo dispersion, and O2- ions were proved to be related with catalytic performance. These findings preliminarily clarified that LDHs preparation methods make a difference in the performance of Mo/LDHs.

TI Engineering of Coordination Environment and Multiscale Structure in
   Single-Site Copper Catalyst for Superior Electrocatalytic Oxygen
   Reduction
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Herein, we report efficient single copper atom catalysts that consist of dense atomic Cu sites dispersed on a three-dimensional carbon matrix with highly enhanced mesoporous structures and improved active site accessibility (Cu-SA/NC(meso)). The ratio of +1 to +2 oxidation state of the Cu sites in the Cu-SA/NC-(meso) catalysts can be controlled by varying the urea content in the adsorption precursor, and the activity for ORR increases with the addition of Cu1+ sites. The optimal Cu1+-SA/NC(meso)-7 catalyst with highly accessible Cu1+ sites exhibits superior ORR activity in alkaline media with a half-wave potential (E-1(/)2) of 0.898 V vs RHE, significantly exceeding the commercial Pt/C, along with high durability and enhanced methanol tolerance. Control experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the superior ORR catalytic performance of Cu1+-SA/NC(meso)-7 catalyst is attributed to the atomically dispersed Cu1+ sites in catalyzing the reaction and the advantage of the introduced mesoporous structure in enhancing the mass transport.

TI Performance and mechanism of CO2 absorption during the
   simultaneous removal of SO2 and NOx by wet
   scrubbing process
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB The co-removal of CO2 while removing SO2 and NOx from industrial flue gas has great potential of carbon emission reduction but related research is lacking. In this study, a wet scrubbing process with various urea solutions for desulfurization and denitrification was explored for the possibility of CO2 absorption. The results showed that the urea-additive solutions were efficient for NOx and SO2 abatement, but delivered < 10% CO2 absorption efficiency. The addition of Ca(OH)(2) dramatically enhanced the CO2 absorption, remained the desulfurization efficiency, unfortunately restricted the denitrification efficiency. Among various operating parameters, pH of solution played a determining role during the absorption. The contradictory pH demands of CO2 absorption and denitrification were observed and discussed in detail. A higher pH of solution than 10 was favorable for CO2 absorption, while the oxidizing of NO to NO2, NO2- or NO3- by NaClO2 was inhibited in this condition. When 7 < pH < 10, it was favorable for the conversion and absorption of NO and NOx. However, the conversion of HCO3- to CO32- was significantly inhibited, hence preventing the absorption of CO2. Large part of Ca(OH)(2) became CaCO3 with a finer particle size, which covered the unreacted Ca(OH)(2) surface after the reaction. Kinetic analysis showed that the CO2 absorption in urea-NaClO2-Ca(OH)(2) absorbent was controlled by chemical reaction in early stage, then by ash layer diffusion in later stage.(c) 2023 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI Bringing Homogeneous Iron Catalysts on the Heterogeneous Side: Solutions
   for Immobilization
SO MOLECULES
AB Noble metal catalysts currently dominate the landscape of chemical synthesis, but cheaper and less toxic derivatives are recently emerging as more sustainable solutions. Iron is among the possible alternative metals due to its biocompatibility and exceptional versatility. Nowadays, iron catalysts work essentially in homogeneous conditions, while heterogeneous catalysts would be better performing and more desirable systems for a broad industrial application. In this review, approaches for heterogenization of iron catalysts reported in the literature within the last two decades are summarized, and utility and critical points are discussed. The immobilization on silica of bis(arylimine)pyridyl iron complexes, good catalysts in the polymerization of olefins, is the first useful heterogeneous strategy described. Microporous molecular sieves also proved to be good iron catalyst carriers, able to provide confined geometries where olefin polymerization can occur. Same immobilizing supports (e.g., MCM-41 and MCM-48) are suitable for anchoring iron-based catalysts for styrene, cyclohexene and cyclohexane oxidation. Another excellent example is the anchoring to a Merrifield resin of an Fe-II-anthranilic acid complex, active in the catalytic reaction of urea with alcohols and amines for the synthesis of carbamates and N-substituted ureas, respectively. A SILP (Supported Ionic Liquid Phase) catalytic system has been successfully employed for the heterogenization of a chemoselective iron catalyst active in aldehyde hydrogenation. Finally, Fe-III ions supported on polyvinylpyridine grafted chitosan made a useful heterogeneous catalytic system for C-H bond activation.

TI Mechanism studies of oxidation and hydrolysis of Cu(I)-NHC and Ag-NHC in
   solution under air
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB The decomposition of copper(I)-NHC and silver-NHC complexes in solution under air was studied. The Cu(I)-NHCs were oxidized into urea derivatives and hydrolysed into imidazoliums or benzimidazoliums. The decomposition of Ag-NHC with a saturated backbone led to ring-opening product, while the Ag-NHC with an unsaturated backbone led to imidazolium and Ag-bisNHC complex. The effects of steric property, hydrophilicity, and binding energy of NHC to O-2 and H2O on the decomposition of Cu(I)-NHC were studied using theoretical calculations. Steric hindrance played an important role on the stability of Cu(I)-NHC. Pathways for the decomposition of Cu(I)-NHC and Ag-NHC were proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Accelerated oxidation-reduction kinetic functional polyurea Binders:
   Diselenide building block as redox co-moderators
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The performance of Li-S batteries based on multiphase and multi-electron transfer mechanisms is highly dependent on the redox kinetics of sulfur. However, the slow redox kinetics of the endogenous redox mediator lithium polysulfides hinders the preparation of high-performance Li-S batteries. In this work, two functional polyurea binders (PUSe and PUS) were synthesized, which possess diselenide or disulfide modules. PUSe and PUS binders can not only limit the shuttling effect of polysulfides by abundant urea groups effectively, but also give the sulfur cathode excellent mechanical properties by introducing intermolecular hydrogen-bonding networks and diselenide and disulfide modules. More significantly, selenium-selenium and sulfur-sulfur modules have been considered as redox co-mediators to accelerate the redox process of sulfur cathode. Li-S batteries involved with PUSe and PUS as binders show excellent electrochemical performance, while significantly accelerating the redox kinetic process, the initial discharge specific capacity of the cell with PUSe as binder was as high as 963.1 mAh/g and 856.7 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 1C; the capacity decay rate is only 0.022% per cycle.

TI Shape-controlled electrochemical synthesis of Au nanocrystals in reline:
   control conditions and electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Gold nanocrystals (NCs) as advanced catalysts towards ethylene glycol (EG) electrooxidation in direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) have some advantages, such as good poisoning-resistance and high electrocatalytic activity. The shape and size control of Au NCs are crucial to their electrocatalytic activity. In this work, the control of morphologies and sizes of prepared Au NCs in reline are systematically investigated by changing electrodeposition conditions: the applied potential, electrodeposition temperature, HAuCl4 concentration and electrodeposition time. Results show that reline (a deep eutectic solvent (DES), a mixture of choline chloride and urea at the molar ratio of 1 : 2) plays an important part in the nucleation and growth of the star-like Au NCs. This approach for preparing star-like Au NCs in reline does not need any supporting electrolyte and organic solvent, and thus is more environmentally friendly than water as a medium. The electrode modified by the as-prepared Au nanostars (NSs) exhibits a good poisoning-resistance ability and electrocatalytic activity for EG electrooxidation in alkaline media. This strategy is a significant way for shape-controlled synthesis of noble metal nanomaterials in DESs that may have potential applications in fields of electrochemical sensors, electrocatalysis and fuel cells.

TI Sustainable and energy-saving hydrogen production via binder-free
   and in situ electrodeposited Ni-Mn-S nanowires on Ni-Cu 3-D
   substrates
SO NANOSCALE
AB Electrochemical water splitting, with its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is undoubtedly the most eco-friendly and sustainable method to produce hydrogen. However, water splitting still requires improvement due to the high energy consumption caused by the slow kinetics and large thermodynamic potential requirements of OER. Urea-water electrolysis has become increasingly appealing compared to water-splitting because of the remarkable decline in the cell potential in the hydrogen production process and less energy consumption; it also offers a favorable opportunity to efficiently treat wastewater containing a significant amount of urea. In this work, Ni-Mn-S/Ni-Cu nano-micro array electrocatalysts were synthesized by a two-step and binder-free electrochemical deposition technique and investigated as an effective electrode for the HER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). According to the electrochemical results, the optimized electrode (Ni-Mn-S/Ni-Cu/10) showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for the HER (64 mV overpotential to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 81 mV dec-1) in alkaline solution. When Ni-Mn-S/Ni-Cu/10 is employed as a UOR anode in an alkaline solution containing urea, it achieves a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 1.247 V vs. RHE. In addition, when the optimized sample was utilized as a bi-functional electrode for overall urea-water electrolysis (HER-UOR), the cell voltage reached 1.302 V at 10 mA cm-2 (which is 141 mV less than that for HER-OER). The electrocatalytic stability results unequivocally revealed small changes in voltage during a 24 h test and showed good durability. This non-noble metal electrocatalyst, prepared by the electrodeposition synthesis method, is a promising solution to implement low-cost hydrogen production and wastewater treatment.

TI Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction of controllable self-assembled
   CuCo2O4
SO IONICS
AB CuCo2O4 is ascribed to the effective OER catalysts due to its different oxidation states and high active sites. In this paper, CuCo2O4 catalysts with different micromorphologies are synthesized by using urea and ammonium fluoride, which can affect the nucleation ability of compounds. The OER catalytic performance of CuCo2O4/NF catalyst has been greatly improved with the synergistic effect of urea and ammonium fluoride. The CCNO-3 sample owns a small overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and that of 309 mV at 20 mA cm(-2). After 14 h of long cycle, the CuCo2O4/NF catalyst also presents stability under the synergistic effect of urea and ammonium fluoride.

TI Sr4Al14O25: Eu<SUP>2+</SUP>,
   Dy<SUP>3+</SUP>/silica core-shell particles synthesized via urea
   combustion method for carbon dioxide reduction in plants
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Strontium Aluminate doped with Europium and Dysprosium is one of the most widely studied phosphors because of its high intensity and long persistence time. In this study, the unique characteristics of strontium aluminate based phosphors, specifically Sr4Al14O25: Eu2+, Dy3+, was utilized as light source for plants for enhanced carbon dioxide reduction in dark field conditions. The Sr4Al14O25: Eu2+, Dy3+ phosphor was synthesized using the combustion method. Stoichiometric amounts of aqueous precursors were dissolved in water, then placed in a high temperature furnace at 600 degrees C to obtain a foamy, amorphous precursor powder. The powders were cooled to room temperature and then grinded. After grinding, the powders were calcined for 8 h at 1300 degrees C. The powders were then encapsulated with silica particles using the Stober process to prevent the oxidation of Eu2+ without a reducing atmosphere during calcination. The obtained coated and uncoated particles were then characterized using SEM, TEM-EDX, XRD and photoluminescence analysis to determine the effect of the core-shell structure on the luminescence properties of the phosphors. Finally, the obtained phosphor-silica core-shell particles will be attached to the surface of four different plant species commonly grown indoors using a mixture of natural oils and waxes as adhesive. The effect of the addition of phosphor as an external light source on the amount of carbon dioxide production of the plants will be monitored and compared to a control specimen without the phosphor as well as with other artificial light sources.

TI Advancing Sustainable Building Materials: Reducing Formaldehyde
   Emissions in Medium Density Fiber Boards with Lignin Nanoparticles
SO ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS
AB The pressing need to develop eco-friendly polymer materials for building applications has led to increased interest in modifying existing polymer systems. In this study, a sustainable approach to augmenting urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins, widely employed in wood-based panels is introduced. Addressing this, formaldehyde-scavenger demethylated lignin nanoparticles into UF resins, aiming to produce a green and enhanced medium-density-fiberboard (MDF) with minimal formaldehyde emissions is incorporated. The results indicate that increasing concentrations of demethylated lignin nanoparticles in the UF adhesive, there is not only a reduction in formaldehyde emissions from MDF composites but also a significant decrease in thickness swelling. The highest reduction in formaldehyde emission is observed in the MDF composite prepared with UF resin containing 7% lignin nanoparticles (UF-7NL), with an emission of 2.9 mg/100 g, marking a substantial decrease of 74% compared to emission of 11.2 mg/100 g from neat resin. Importantly, this reduction does not compromise physical and mechanical properties of the MDF; they remain comparable to boards bonded with unmodified UF. Molecular modeling revealed that lignin effectively traps formaldehyde, incorporating it as -CH2OH groups, leading to a notable decrease in formaldehyde emission from MDF. This approach offers an eco-friendly modification to a common polymer, showcasing lignin nanoparticles as innovative additives.

TI Crystalline Ni(OH)2/Amorphous NiMoOx
   Mixed-Catalyst with Pt-Like Performance for Hydrogen Production
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The achievement of effective alkaline hydrogen production from water electrolysis is an active field of research. Herein, an integrated electrode composed of crystalline Ni(OH)(2) and amorphous NiMoOx is fabricated onto nickel foam (denoted as Ni(OH)(2)-NiMoOx/NF). The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics are optimized along with phase transformation process during soaking operation. An overpotential of 36 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) along with the low Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1) reveals the catalyst's excellent HER performance and a Heyrovsky-step-controlled HER mechanism. When assembled into a urea-assisted water electrolyzer, a voltage of 1.42 V can reach 10 mA cm(-2). Further experiments and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results illustrate the synergy effect between crystalline and amorphous areas and the optimized water dissociation step. Crystalline Ni(OH)(2) serves as the scissor for water dissociation in an alkali environment to produce H*, while the amorphous NiMoOx layer serves as the location for H* adsorption and H-2 desorption.

TI Synergistic Co-grafting of multiwalled carbon nanotubes using SO3H and
   choline chloride-urea in fabricating uniform thin films with enhanced
   visible light transparency and reduced sheet resistance
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB New materials and innovative modification methods are indispensable to advance the energy field. The present work reports the fabrication of transparent conducting electrodes using Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) that have been modified with sulfonic acid (SO3H) and a combination of Choline Chloride-Urea/Sulfonic acid (DES/SO3H). A comprehensive investigation was conducted to ascertain the impact of employing DES and SO3H in achieving consistent and long-lasting dispersions of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in different solvents and the most favourable condition was achieved when employing n-heptanol. The films were fabricated on glass substrate by using the spray pyrolysis technique. The stability of the system following the modification was unequivocally confirmed by SEM analysis, while the electronic structure was assessed qualitatively by EDX analysis. Optical profilometry analysis revealed that the film thickness fell within the range of 350-385 nm. The co-grafted film demonstrated an optical transparency of approximately 84.96%, modestly exceeding that of the singly grafted film, which was determined to be 70.14% in the visible region. The sheet resistance of DES/S-MWCNT and S-MWCNTs was calculated to be approximately 3.33k Omega/Sq and 5.02k Omega/Sq, respectively. The calculated charge transfer resistance (RCT) for the co-grafted and singly grafted MWCNT systems was 0.185 Omega and 0.190 Omega, respectively. These values align closely with the corresponding sheet resistance values obtained. The electrochemical investigations also showed an increased specific capacity for DES/S-MWCNT, approximately 896.2C/g, whereas the calculated value for the S-MWCNT system was 826.8C/g.

TI Adverse effects of triclosan on kidney in mice: Implication of lipid
   metabolism disorders
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Triclosan (TCS) is a ubiquitous antimicrobial used in daily consumer products. Previous reports have shown that TCS could induce hepatotoxicity, endocrine disruption, disturbance on immune function and impaired thyroid function. Kidney is critical in the elimination of toxins, while the effects of TCS on kidney have not yet been well-characterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of TCS exposure on kidney function and the possible underlying mechanisms in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were orally exposed to TCS with the doses of 10 and 100 mg/(kg ??? day) for 13 weeks. TCS was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted by corn oil for exposure. Corn oil containing DMSO was used as vehicle control. Serum and kidney tissues were collected for study. Biomarkers associated with kidney function, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis were assessed. Our results showed that TCS could cause renal injury as was revealed by increased levels of renal function markers including serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, as well as increased oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic markers in a dose dependent manner, which were more significantly in 100 mg/(kg ??? day) group. Mass spectrometry-based analysis of metabolites related with lipid metabolism demonstrated the occurrence of lipid accumulation and defective fatty acid oxidation in 100 mg/(kg ??? day) TCS-exposed mouse kidney. These processes might lead to lipotoxicity and energy depletion, thus resulting in kidney fibrosis and functional decline. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that TCS could induce lipid accumulation and fatty acid metabolism disturbance in mouse kidney, which might contribute to renal function impairment. The present study further widens our insights into the adverse effects of TCS. ?? 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI A Photoelectrochemical Sensor Based on Anodic TiO2 for
   Glucose Determination
SO SENSORS
AB A simple photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor based on non-modified nanostructured anodic TiO2 was fabricated and used for a rapid and sensitive detection of glucose. The anodic TiO2 layers were synthesized in an ethylene glycol-based solution containing NH4F (0.38 wt.%) and H2O (1.79 wt.%) via a three-step procedure carried out at the constant voltage of 40 V at 20 degrees C. At the applied potentials of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE), the developed sensor exhibited a photoelectochemical response toward the oxidation of glucose, and two linear ranges in calibration plots were observed. The highest sensitivity of 0.237 mu A mu mol(-1) cm(-2) was estimated for the applied bias of 1 V. The lowest limit of detection (LOD) was obtained for the potential of 0.5 V vs. SCE (7.8 mM) with the fastest response at similar to 3 s. Moreover, the proposed PEC sensor exhibited relatively high sensibility, good reproducibility, and due to its self-cleaning properties, a good long-term stability. Interfering tests showed the selective response of the sensor in the presence of urea and uric acid. Real-life sample analyses were performed using an intravenous glucose solution, which confirmed the possibility of determining the concentration of analyte in such types of samples.

TI Phenolics as Mediators to Accelerate the Enzymatically Initialized
   Oxidation of Laccase-Mediator-Systems for the Production of Medium
   Density Fiberboards
SO BIORESOURCES
AB Crude oil as a non-renewable resource is creating new challenges in many industrial sectors. Unsteady costs of crude oil at present and expected increases in the future are due to its limited availability as a finite resource, and these costs negatively impact the industry for wood-based panels, which use petrochemical resins in binding agents. Furthermore, wood panels that are conventionally bonded using urea formaldehyde diffuse formaldehyde into the surrounding air. To achieve independence from petrochemical products and harmful formaldehyde emissions, alternatives for their substitution are in demand. An alternative approach is the enzymatic activation of lignin located on the surface of thermomechanical pulp (TMP) fibers. The present study shows the results of internal bond strength (DIN EN 319 1993), modulus of rupture (DIN EN 310 1993), and thickness swelling (EN 317 2003) of medium-density fiberboards (MDF) bonded with laccase-mediator-system (LMS). Caffeic acid (CA), 4-hydoxy benzoic acid (HBA), and vanillic alcohol (VAl) were used as mediators. The physical and technological properties of MDF, such as internal bond strength, modulus of rupture, and thickness swelling, mostly fulfilled the European standards.

TI CuPd bimetallic nanoparticles supported magnetic ionic liquid-derived
   N-doped carbon as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the
   one-pot oxidative multicomponent reactions
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Background: Multicomponent reactions often rely on aldehydes as the reactants, limiting their widespread use. To enhance the versatility and scope of these reactions, aldehydes can be replaced with alcohols. Methods: In this study, nitrogen-doped magnetic carbon nanostructures modified with imidazolium-based ionic liquid (Fe3O4@N-C-IL) were prepared. These nanostructures were synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal carbonization method using ferric chloride in the presence of glucose, urea, epichlorohydrin and 1-methylimidazole as carbon source, nitrogen source, linker and ionic liquid, respectively. Then, CuPd bimetallic nanoparticles were immobilized on the synthesized nanostructures by a wet chemical reduction process. Significant findings: The catalytic activity of the nanostructures was evaluated in the oxidation of alcohol under base-free conditions. The results indicate that the CuPd bimetallic catalyst exhibited better catalytic performance than both Cu and Pd monometallic catalysts, suggesting a synergistic effect between copper and palladium. Also, a non-ionic liquid-based catalyst was synthesized and used in the model reaction to study the effect of imidazolium ionic liquid species on the catalytic activity. The results showed that these species enhanced the catalytic activity. Finally, the catalytic activity of the synthesized structure was evaluated through a one-pot tandem oxidative synthesis of dihydropyrimidinones (Biginelli reaction) and dihydropyridines (Hantzsch reaction).

TI Ultrasound-seeded vapor-phase-transport growth of boundary-rich layered
   double hydroxide nanosheet arrays for highly efficient water splitting
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Noble-metal-free electrodes are of significant importance for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (TM LDHs) show great potential as advanced electrocatalysts, but low electrochemical active areas and poor electronic conductivity limit their catalytic activity. Herein, we report a novel secondary growth strategy to synthesize ultrathin NiCoFe LDH nanosheets anchored on nickel foam (NF). By coupling ultrasound-assisted oxidation (UAO) to deposit dense seeds of low-crystalline NiCoFe LDH array on semisacrificial NF, and vapor-phase-transport (VPT) of urea for kinetic control over nanosheet thickness, hierarchical self-supported electrodes with high density of exposed active sites and abundant boundaries have been facilely obtained. The NiCoFe LDH/NF electrodes show an impressive electrocatalytic performance during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with required overpotentials of 217 and 227 mV to achieve current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) respectively, with over 150 h long-term stability, outperforming those synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis (HTT) as well as most state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The overall water splitting device assembled using the NiCoFe LDH/NF electrode as both anode and cathode shows an ultralow cell voltage of 1.56 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2). This strategy provides a simple and scalable methodology for synthesizing high-activity catalysts for efficient electrochemical processes.

While 2 itself is a sluggish oxidant, 2,6-lutidine assists the heterolytic O-O bond cleavage of the metal-bound alkylperoxo, giving rise to a reactive metal-based oxidant. The roles of the urea groups on the supporting ligand, and of the base, in directing the selective and catalytic oxygenation of hydrocarbon substrates by 2 are discussed.

TI Fe-induced crystalline-amorphous interface engineering of a NiMo-based
   heterostructure for enhanced water oxidation
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Engineering heterostructures with a unique surface/interface structure is one of the effective strategies to develop highly active noble-metal-free catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), because the surface/interface of catalysts is the main site for the OER. Herein, we design a coralloid NiMo(Fe)-20 catalyst with a crystalline-amorphous interface through combining a hydrothermal method and an Fe-induced surface reconfiguration strategy. That is, after Fe3+ impregnation treatment, the Ni(OH)2-NiMoO4 pre-catalyst with a complete crystalline surface is restructured into a trimetallic heterostructure with a crystalline-amorphous interface, which facilitates mass diffusion and charge transfer during the OER. As expected, self-supported NiMo(Fe)-20 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic water oxidation performance (overpotential: eta-10 = 220 mV, eta-100 = 239 mV) in the alkaline electrolyte, and its electrocatalytic performance hardly changes after maintaining the current density of 50 mA cm-2 for 10 hours. Furthermore, nickel foam (NF) supported commercial Pt/C and self-supported NiMo(Fe)-20 served as the cathode and anode of the Pt/C||NiMo(Fe)-20 electrolyzer, respectively, which exhibits a lower cell voltage (E-100 = 1.53 V) than that of the Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer (E-100 = 1.58 V) assembled with noble metal-based catalysts. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of the NiMo(Fe)-20 catalyst is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the crystalline-amorphous interface and the coralloid trimetallic heterostructure.
   Engineering heterostructure with unique surface/interface structure is one of the effective strategies to develop highly active noble-metal-free catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.

TI Co- and V2O3-Modified Ni-Based Nanocatalyst for
   5-Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB The electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides a prospective method to produce high-value 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Since this multistep process includes the oxidation of aldehyde and hydroxyl groups, a deep understanding of the mechanism of HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is crucial. Herein, the surface reconstruction of the nickel-based catalyst is regulated by Co and V2O3 modifications to reveal the relationship between the reconstructed surface and the HMFOR performance. The introduction of the V2O3 nanosheet facilitates the in situ reconstruction of the nickel-based nanocatalyst by enhancing the adsorption of OH*. The incorporation of Co adjusts the electronic structure of nickel, contributing to a decrease in the formation potential of NiOOH. Moreover, the insitugenerated NiOOH promotes the adsorption and activation of aldehyde and hydroxyl groups, providing beneficial effects for HMFOR. Impressively, Co-Ni/V2O3/NF needs only 1.29 V-RHE to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for HMFOR and maintains high FDCA selectivity for 10 cycles. This work explains the regulations of V2O3 and Co on NiOOH species formation, which is conducive to designing an efficient nickel-based catalyst for HMF oxidation.

TI Photoinactivation of jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis)
   urease in fresh human urine using dichromatic low-pressure UV
   irradiation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In source-separating sanitation systems, inhibiting urease activity prevents enzymatic urea hydrolysis and volatilisation of ammonia when urine is concentrated by evaporation. This study tested UV -based photoinactivation as a novel alternative to existing methods of inactivating urease that require dosing urine with acid, base or oxidants. The enzymatic activity of jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) urease in water, synthetic fresh urine and real fresh urine was investigated, with and without a 15 W low-pressure UV lamp that emitted 185 nm and 254 nm radiation. In UV -free controls, urea was hydrolysed at a rate of 3.2 x 10-3 mmol mgurease - 1 min -1, 3.3 x 10-3 mmol mgurease - 1 min -1 and 2.0 x 10-3 mmol mgurease- 1 min -1 in water, synthetic urine and real urine, respectively. In the presence of UV, no urease activity was detected in any matrix. A UV irradiation time of 1.3 and 3.3 min was needed for inactivating urease in water and synthetic urine, respectively, whereas an irradiation time of 71 min was needed for inactivating urease in real urine. Overall, the electrical energy demand for photoinactivation of urease in real human urine was estimated to be 29.1 kWh m- 3. Photolysis and photo -oxidation of amino acid residues at the active site of the enzyme were likely reasons for inactivation. Organic metabolites in real urine affected photoinactivation by (i) absorbing radiation between 190 nm and 400 nm, which reduced incident radiant flux; and (ii) scavenging hydroxyl radicals, which impeded oxidative damage to the enzyme. Overall, the findings demonstrate the feasibility of on -site treatment using a low-pressure UV lamp for inactivating urease in freshly excreted urine.

TI Fabrication of MgCo2O4@MnO2
   nanocomposite on nickel foam with a core-shell structure and its
   application for glucose measurement
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The core-shell structured nanomaterial of MgCo2O4@MnO2 on nickel foam (MCMNA/NF) was synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal method. It can be used as a self-supported electrode, which was constructed to an electrochemical sensor for sensitive measurement of glucose. The core-shell structure with a MnO2 shell significantly enhances the material's specific surface area and accelerates the electron transport process. Electrochemical catalytic oxidation tests were conducted on core-shell structured MCMNA/NF nanocomposite as a working electrode. The sensitivity is determined to be 9.37 mu A<middle dot>mM(-1)<middle dot>cm(-2) and the detection limit is 0.02 mM. These test results demonstrate that the material exhibits excellent stability and selectivity as a glucose sensor. The synergistic effect of MgCo2O4 and MnO2 can effectively promote the application performance of the electrode materials. The MgCo2O4@MnO2 glucose sensor material also exhibits exceptional resistance to interference, demonstrating no interference from Urea, Citric acid (CA), Ascorbic acid (AA), or specific inorganic salts during blood glucose detection.

TI Study of the Mechanism of the Transformation and Transfer of Contact
   Layers in the Lubricating Medium-Surface Tribopair System
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB With the purpose of improving the method for the in-place-repair of the surfaces of machinery parts and reducing friction and wear parameters due to the action of a reductive lubricating composition (RLC), the mechanism of the transformation and transfer of contact layers in the bulk of the lubricating medium between the RLC components and the reconstructed surface is studied. A hypothesis of how the contact layers of the lubricating medium are transformed and transferred and are consecutively subjected to deformation, shear, and removal into the bulk, being then replaced by new contact layers of lubricating medium, is put forward. A theoretical analysis shows that the most important factors for increasing the efficiency of RLC are the structuring of the lubricating medium by nanosized metallic elements and the selective aggregation and removal of wear products and oil oxidation products on a filter. These conditions are provided by increasing the effectiveness of the traditional RLC and other additives and by introducing into the lubricating medium a mixture of nitrogen-containing components, such as ammonium hydroxide and urea. Adding the modified oil composition into commercial oil makes it possible to double its repair-recovery and antiwear capabilities. The additives proposed are effective at low dosages (3 vol % in oil), being, in addition, nontoxic and posing no hazard when handled and transported.

TI Trimethylamine N-Oxide Reduces the Susceptibility of Escherichia
   coli to Multiple Antibiotics
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), an important intestinal flora-derived metabolite, plays a role in the development of cardiovascular disease and tumor immunity. Here, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics against Escherichia coli under gradient concentrations of TMAO and performed a bacterial killing analysis. Overall, TMAO (in the range of 10 similar to 100 mM) increased the MIC of quinolones, aminoglycosides, and beta-lactams in a concentration-dependent manner, and increased the lethal dose of antibiotics against E. coli. It implies that TMAO is a potential risk for failure of anti-infective therapy, and presents a case for the relationship between intestinal flora-derived metabolites and antibiotic resistance. Further data demonstrated that the inhibition of antibiotic efficacy by TMAO is independent of the downstream metabolic processes of TMAO and the typical bacterial resistance mechanisms (mar motif and efflux pump). Interestingly, TMAO protects E. coli from high-protein denaturant (urea) stress and improves the viability of bacteria following treatment with two disinfectants (ethanol and hydrogen peroxide) that mediate protein denaturation by chemical action or oxidation. Since antibiotics can induce protein inactivation directly or indirectly, our work suggests that disruption of protein homeostasis may be a common pathway for different stress-mediated bacterial growth inhibition/cell death. In addition, we further discuss this possibility, which provides a different perspective to address the global public health problem of antibiotic resistance.

TI Cu/Biochar Bifunctional Catalytic Removal of COS and
   H2S:H2O Dissociation and CuO Anchoring Enhanced by
   Pyridine N
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Economic and environmentally friendly strategies are needed to promote the bifunctional catalytic removal of carbonyl sulfide (COS) by hydrolysis and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by oxidation. N doping is considered to be an effective strategy, but the essential and intrinsic role of N dopants in catalysts is still not well understood. Herein, the conjugation of urea and biochar during Cu/biochar annealing produced pyridine N, which increased the combined COS/H2S capacity of the catalyst from 260.7 to 374.8 mg center dot g(-1) and enhanced the turnover frequency of H2S from 2.50 x 10(-4) to 5.35 x 10(-4) s(-1). The nucleophilic nature of pyridine N enhances the moderate basic sites of the catalyst, enabling the attack of protons and strong H2O dissociation. Moreover, pyridine N also forms cavity sites that anchor CuO, improving Cu dispersion and generating more reactive oxygen species. By providing original insight into the pyridine N-induced bifunctional catalytic removal of COS/H2S in a slightly oxygenated and humid atmosphere, this study offers valuable guidance for further C= S and C-S bond-breaking in the degradation of sulfur-containing pollutants.

TI Reuse of wastewaters on dyeing of polyester fabric with encapsulated
   disperse dye
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB The textile industry can benefit from the use of microcapsules, both adding value to products through the production of technical or functional textiles and improving the processes in the production chain. Some applications have been widely explored in academic research, but many are not feasible for use in industrial scale. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop consistent and efficient methodologies for the encapsulation of active compounds commonly used in the textile industry, employing materials which are viable for large-scale application. In this study, polyurethane-urea microcapsules were formulated by interfacial polymerization and encapsulated with C.I Disperse Blue 60 for the dyeing of polyester fabric without the use of dispersing agents and other auxiliaries. The dyeing was carried out in a high temperature dyeing machine with a very simple dyebath, in which there are only dissolved dye molecules, microencapsulated dyes and the fabric. Additionally, the dyebath wastewaters were reused on a further dyeing as 100% bathwater and mixed with 50% distilled water. Colorimetric measurements show excellent colour removal in both samples.

TI Amino modulation on the surface of graphitic carbon nitride for enhanced
   photocatalytic hydrogen production
SO CARBON
AB Bulk graphitic carbon nitride suffers from the disadvantages of a small specific surface area, high recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, and low surface catalytic activity, which greatly limits its application in catalytic reactions. In this study, amino groups were incorporated into the structure of bulk carbon nitride by solvothermal treatment facilitated by an optimal content of urea. The experimental data suggested that the introduced amino groups modified the morphology and structure of bulk carbon nitride, and improved the charge separation. More importantly, the enriched amino groups promoted the formation of nitrogen -rich carbon nitride, which was conducive to the deposition and reduction of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles. The resulting Pt/gC3N4 composite exhibited excellent visible -light -driven activity for hydrogen evolution. A high rate of 410.51 mu mol h-1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 17 % was achieved, which is 85.5 times higher than that of bulk carbon nitride. The effective approach developed in this work could provide new insights into the design of bulk carbon nitride with enhanced performance.

TI The template-assisted wet-combustion synthesis of copper oxide
   nanoparticles on mesoporous network of alumina nanofibers
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB A novel wet-combustion method is developed to functionalize mesoporous network of alumina nano fibers. The wet-combustion method includes coating the nanofibers with the solution of the precursors of dopants mixed with fuels, followed by dissociation/oxidation of the precursors in a combustion mode. Due to the high temperature of the flame and short duration of the combustion process, this approach possesses such unique feature as control over the size, morphology and homogeneity of the deposited nanostructures as well as ability to avoid additional procedures of calcination.
   In this study, urea and glycine as the basic fuels and copper nitrate as the precursor of copper and oxidant as well as mesoporous network of alumina nanofibers (with single fiber diameter of 7 +/- 2 nm) as the template are used. As a result, a mesoporous network of highly oriented copper oxide alumina composite nanofibers are produced. It is shown that the fuel type and the ratio of fuel-to-oxidizer do not evidently influence on the chemical composition of the product, while the morphology of the deposited copper oxide is controlled by the initial composition of reagents. The average crystallite size of the deposited CuO is 16 and 19 nm for the systems containing stoichiometric amount of glycine and urea, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Electrocatalysis of Methanol Oxidation in Alkaline Electrolytes over
   Novel Amorphous Fe/Ni Biphosphate Material Prepared by Different
   Techniques
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this work, novel phosphate materials based on bimetallic character (Fe and Ni) were introduced by different chemical fabrication methods, the reflux method (FeNiP-R) and the sol-gel technique (FeNiP-S), and evaluated as non-precious electrodes for methanol electrooxidation in KOH electrolytes. The designed FeNiP-R and FeNiP-S samples were investigated using different characterization techniques, namely TEM, SEM, XPS, BET, DLS, and FT-IR, to describe the impact of the fabrication technique on the chemistry, morphology, and surface area. The characterization techniques indicate the successful fabrication of nanoscale-sized particles with higher agglomeration by the sol-gel technique compared with the reflux strategy. After that, the electrochemical efficiency of the fabricated FeNiP-R and FeNiP-S as electrodes for electrocatalytic methanol oxidation was studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different methanol concentrations and scan rates in addition to impedance analysis and chronoamperometric techniques. From electrochemical analyses, a sharp improvement in the obtained current values was observed in both electrodes, FeNiP-R and FeNiP-S. During the MeOH electrooxidation over FeNiP-S, the current value was improved from 0.14 mA/cm(2) at 0.402 V to 2.67 mA/cm(2) at 0.619 V, which is around 109 times the current density value (0.0243 mA/cm(2) at 0.62 V) found in the absence of MeOH. The designed FeNiP-R electrode showed an improved electrocatalytic character compared with FeNiP-S at different methanol concentrations up to 80 mmol/L. The enhancement of the anodic current density and charge transfer resistance indicates the methanol electrooxidation over the designed bimetallic Fe/Ni-phosphates.

TI Preparation of g-C3N4 Nanosheets/CuO with Enhanced
   Catalytic Activity on the Thermal Decomposition of Ammonium Perchlorate
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The thermal oxidation etching assisted g-C3N4 nanosheets/CuO was prepared through a facile co-precipitation strategy. In this work, the structure, morphology, and composition of g-C3N4 (UCN, prepared by urea), g-C3N4 nanosheets (TCN, prepared by thermal oxidation etching of UCN), g-C3N4/CuO (UCN/CuO), g-C3N4 nanosheets/CuO (TCN/CuO) were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the catalytic effect of the obtained samples on the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) was examined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). As a result, in the case of 5 wt% TCN/CuO, the high decomposition temperature of AP decreased by 120.6 degrees C, which is much lower than that of UCN, TCN, CuO and UCN/CuO. In addition, the exothermic heat released from the decomposition of AP increased from 430.64 J g(-1) to 2856.08 J g(-1). This evident catalytic activity may be related to the synergistic effect of CuO and TCN. This work provides a novel strategy for the construction of composite catalyst for the thermal decomposition of AP, which is supposed to possess significant potential in the solid propellant field.

AB Atrazine is a commonly used weedicide in agriculture fields. Owing to its long half-life (125 days) and slow biodegradability, it adds to problematic residues in the environment. It is known to disrupt endocrine and reproductive systems and has potential to damage vital organs such as liver, kidney and heart. While atrazine is banned in European countries, many countries, such as India, China, and the USA it is still in use widely. In atrazine biodegradation, batch bioreactors are most commmon cost effective alternative to conventional methods. However, it has only major limitation of slow rate of degradation. In this work, we explored coupling of UV-Fenton and biological method for atrazine removal and also optimized the process parameters. In the bioreactor, Loofa was used as the packing media on which consortia was immobilized. The performance of coupled system was studied with an initial atrazine concentration of 300 mg/L. Overall, maximum removal efficiency of 93% was achieved for the coupled system. GC-MS analysis of residual treated effluent sample was performed to identify the intermediate compound. Two metabolites biuret and urea were identified which confirmed the degradation of atrazine. The growth kinetic parameters mu(max) (0.224 per day) and Ks (106.64) were calculated using Monod model.

TI Kinetic and Mechanistic Study on Catalytic Decomposition of Hydrogen
   Peroxide on Carbon-Nanodots/Graphitic Carbon Nitride Composite
SO CATALYSTS
AB The metal-free CDots/g-C3N4 composite, normally used as the photocatalyst in H-2 generation and organic degradation, can also be applied as an environmental catalyst by in-situ production of strong oxidant hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) via catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) without light irradiation. In this work, CDots/g-C3N4 composite was synthesized via an electrochemical method preparing CDots followed by the thermal polymerization of urea. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and pore width distribution were carried out for characterization. The intrinsic catalytic performance, including kinetics and thermodynamic, was studied in terms of catalytic decomposition of H2O2 without light irradiation. The second-order rate constant of the reaction was calculated to be (1.42 +/- 0.07) x 10(-9) m.s(-1) and the activation energy was calculated to be (29.05 +/- 0.80) kJ.mol(-1). Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris) was selected to probe the produced HO. during the decomposing of H2O2 as well as to buffer the pH of the solution. The composite was shown to be base-catalyzed and the optimal performance was achieved at pH 8.0. A detailed mechanism involving the adsorb-catalyze double reaction site was proposed. Overall, CDots/g-C3N4 composite can be further applied in advanced oxidation technology in the presence of H2O2 and the instinct dynamics and the mechanism can be referred to further applications in related fields.

TI Ammoxidized Fenton-Activated Pine Kraft Lignin Accelerates Synthesis and
   Curing of Resole Resins
SO POLYMERS
AB Ammoxidation of pine kraft lignin in aqueous 5 wt % ammonia affords a novel type of phenol substitute that significantly accelerates resole synthesis and curing as demonstrated for 40 wt % phenol replacement. Compared to non-ammoxidized lignin, which already shortens significantly the cooking time required to reach a resole viscosity of 1000 Pa . s (250 vs. 150 s) and reduces the typical curing B-time by about 25% at 100 degrees C, the use of ammoxidized lignin has an even more pronounced impact in this respect. Activation of lignin by Fenton-type oxidation prior to ammoxidation further boosts both synthesis and curing of the resole. This is presumably due to the intermediary formation of polyvalent cross-linkers like N, N, N-tris (methylol) trimethylene triamine triggered by saponification of a larger fraction of nitrogenous moieties present in such a treated lignin (ammonium salts, amide-type nitrogen, urea) and reaction of the released ammonia with formaldehyde. Except for the fact that phenol replacement by ammoxidized lignin results in a somewhat less brittle cured adhesive polymer and higher elastic modulus, the aforementioned acceleration in curing could no longer be observed in the presence of wood, where a significantly delayed wood-adhesive bond formation was observed for the lignin-containing adhesives as evident from the automated bonding evaluation system.

TI A nickel nanoparticle engineered
   CoFe2O4/SiO2-NH2@carboxamide
   composite as a novel scaffold for the oxidation of sulfides and
   oxidative coupling of thiols
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The purpose of this work was to prepare a new Ni-carboxamide complex supported on CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (CoFe2O4/SiO2-NH2@carboxamide-Ni). The carboxamide host material unit generated cavities that stabilized the nickel nanoparticles effectively and prevented the aggregation and separation of these particles on the surface. This compound was appropriately characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, FE-SEM, ICP-OES, EDX, XRD, TGA analysis, VSM, and X-ray atomic mapping. The catalytic oxidation of sulfides and oxidative coupling of thiols in the presence of the designed catalyst was explored as a highly selective catalyst using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a green oxidant. The easy separation, simple workup, excellent stability of the nanocatalyst, short reaction times, non-explosive materials as well as appropriate yields of the products are some outstanding advantages of this protocol.

TI Preparation and characterization of polymeric cellulose wood adhesive
   with excellent bonding properties and water resistance
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Developing the most abundant cellulose resources in nature as wood adhesives is a challenging but significant work. In this study, an oxidized cellulose-hexamethylene diamine-urea (OCHU) resin adhesive, of high bonding performance, and excellent water resistance has been prepared. The cellulose was firstly enzymatically hydrolyzed to increase its solubility and expose more hydroxyl groups, then oxidized by sodium periodate (NaIO4) to generate a biological compound being rich of aldehyde groups. The OCHU adhesive was prepared by crosslinking oxidized cellulose (OC) with a synthetic reactive polyurea (HU) polymer, which was formed through the deamidation reaction between hexamethylenediamine (H) and urea (U). This adhesive exhibited a 24 h cold water soaking strength of 1.61 MPa, 3 h hot water (63 degrees C) strength of 1.05 MPa and a dry strength of 1.71 MPa. Compared to oxidized cellulose-hexamethylenediamine (OCH) adhesive, a significant increase of 60 % in this adhesive's wet strength. The Schiff base and addition reactions in the preparation were confirmed by XPS, solidstate NMR, and FTIR. This cellulose-based wood adhesive has great market competitiveness for mass production and application in the plywood industry, due to its excellent bonding properties.

TI N-doped microcrystalline graphite for boosting peroxymonosulfate
   activation with highly efficient degradation of bisphenol A
SO CARBON
AB With the excellent electrical conductivity and unique structure, carbonaceous materials are expected to prepare green catalysts used in sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes. Nevertheless, most of researches are focusing on artificial synthetic material to date, thus the studies on natural carbon materials call for attention and development. Herein, impregnation-pyrolysis method was employed by adopting the urea as an extrinsic N-dopant under 850 degrees C to favor C-N configuration for natural microcrystalline graphite (MG). And N element presented as pyridinic N (27.42 %), pyrrolic N (40.08 %), graphitic N (25.86 %) and nitric oxide (6.65 %) in N -doped microcrystalline graphite (NMG). In addition, the catalysis performance of MG, NMG and calcined microcrystalline graphite (CMG) was examined by the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA). The NMG system exhibited high activity in a broad pH range, and acidic conditions promote the reaction rate greatly. Based on quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance, the degradation mechanisms comprised radical and nonradical pathway, in which 1O2 was the dominant reactive oxidative species (ROS). This study suggested that pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, sp (2)-hybridized carbon structure as well as defects in NMG promoted the generation of ROS, and provides a new insight in natural carbon materials for the fabrication of new eco-friendly and highly efficient PMS activation catalysts.

TI Enhanced photoelectrochemical charge transfer on Mn-doped
   CdS/TiO2 nanotube arrays: The roles of organic substrates
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB The application of photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems to harness solar energy while treating wastewater or biomass-laden streams is an emerging area of sustainability. On this basis, we investigate the Mn-doped CdS quantum dots supported on TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNT) as the visible light-responsive photoanode. The introduction of Mn-dopant (optimum Mn:Cd = 0.15) enhanced the photoelectron lifetime of the composite photoanode. This made available more photoholes for surface transfer, as reflected by the increase in photocurrent. The addition of organic compounds drastically enhanced the photocurrent, given their faster oxidation rates compared to water. Depending on the type of organic compounds, whether they are direct hole scavengers (formic acid, diethanolamine, triethanolamine) or hydroxyl radical scavengers (methanol, glucose, urea), tend to impart different extent of photocurrents enhancement. While the measured photocurrent was in most cases higher for Mn-doped CdS/TNT than the undoped composite, we found that direct hole scavengers were up to an order of magnitude more efficient than the hydroxyl radical scavengers in promoting surface holes transfer. Interestingly, the Mn-dopant was highly beneficial in improving the oxidation of hydroxyl radical scavengers, presumably due to the enhanced charge carrier lifetime that was necessary for more efficient production of hydroxyl radicals. For the first time, the current doubling-like effects were verified for compounds with alcohol functional groups through the measurements of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) above unity.

TI Enhancement of Au/AC acetylene hydrochlorination catalyst activity and
   stability via nitrogen-modified activated carbon support
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Improving the durability of Au3+ catalyst is an important step in increasing its utility when performing catalyzed acetylene hydrochlorination. Using nitrogen-modified activated carbon (NAC) as support, Au/NAC1 catalyst demonstrated excellent activity and stability when compared with the undoped Au/AC1 under the conditions of 180 degrees C and 1480 h(-1) of gas hourly space velocity (C2H2 based). Moreover, the Au/NAC1 catalyst delivered a stable performance during a 300 h test with the conversion of acetylene and the selectivity of vinyl chloride both reaching more than 99.9% at C2H2 hourly space velocity 100 h(-1), which substantially exceeds the best results reported in previous literature. The removal of carboxylic groups from the activated carbon surface and the introduction of nitrogen atoms as anchor sites by thermal pretreatment with urea are preferential to stabilize the catalytic active Au3+ species and inhibit the reduction of Au3+ to Au-0 in the preparation process of Au/NAC1 catalysts. In addition, increasing the electron density of Au3+ via electron transfer from nitrogen atoms to the Au3+ center can increase the adsorption of hydrogen chloride and inhibit the reduction of Au3+ to Au-0 during acetylene hydrochlorination and hence improve the catalytic stability. The excellent catalytic performance of the Au/NAC1 catalyst demonstrated its potential as an alternative to mercury chloride catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI Promoted VOC oxidation over homogeneous porous
   CoxNiAlO composite oxides derived from hydrotalcites:
   effect of preparation method and doping
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Homogeneous porous and curve plated CoxNiAlO composite metal oxide catalysts are obtained from the thermal decomposition of CoxNiAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors, which are prepared by urea co-precipitation with surfactant, followed by a hydrothermal treatment. The as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, BET, SEM, TEM, H-2-TPR and XPS. The Co3AlO sample shows 90% benzene conversion (T-90) at 236 degrees C at a high space velocity (SV = 60 000 mL g(-1) h(-1)), and possesses much higher activity than Co3AlO prepared with NaOH co-precipitation without surfactant, with T-90 = 288 degrees C. This is mainly correlated with the narrower pore size (2.9 vs. 17.2 nm) and lower temperature reducibility (319 vs. 360 degrees C). The Co2NiAlO sample exhibits enhanced activity at T-90 = 227 degrees C with the low activation energy of 39.0 kJ mol(-1), and its lower temperature reducibility is ascribed to the larger amount of surface accessible Co3+. The Co2NiAlO sample owns good reproducibility and superior reversibility and long stability with prolonged time on benzene stream in the presence of 3.5% water vapor. Moreover, a monolithic Co2NiAlO film catalyst is fabricated by the thermal decomposition of an LDH film precursor through an in situ growth methodology, with a high reaction rate of 1.21 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under T-90 = 275 degrees C.

TI Casein infusion rate influences feed intake differently depending on
   metabolizable protein balance in dairy cows: A multilevel meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
AB The effects of casein infusion have been investigated extensively in ruminant species. Its effect on responses in dry matter intake (DMI) has been reviewed and indicated no significant effect. The literature reviewed in the current meta-analysis is more extensive and limited to dairy cows fed ad libitum. A total of 51 studies were included in the meta-analysis and data were fitted to a multilevel model adjusting for the correlated nature of some studies. The effect size was the mean difference calculated by subtracting the means for the control from the casein-infused group. Overall, casein infusion [average of 333 g of dry matter (DM)/d; range: 91 to 1,092 g of DM/d] tended to increase responses in DMI by 0.18 kg/d (n = 48 studies; 3 outliers). However, an interaction was observed between the casein infusion rate (IR) and the initial metabolizable protein (MP) balance [i.e., supply minus requirements (NRC, 2001)]. When control cows were in negative MP balance (n = 27 studies), responses in DMI averaged 0.28 kg/d at mean MP balance (-264 g/d) and casein IR (336 g/d), and a 100 g/d increment in the casein IR from its mean increased further responses by 0.14 kg/d (MP balance being constant), compared with cows not infused with casein. In contrast, when control cows were in positive MP balance (n = 22 studies; 2 outliers), responses in DMI averaged 0.20 kg/d at mean casein IR (339 g/d), and a 100 g/d increment in the casein IR from its mean further decreased responses by 0.33 kg/d, compared with cows not infused with casein. Responses in milk true protein yield at mean casein IR were greater (109 vs. 65 g/d) for cows in negative vs. positive MP balance, respectively, and the influence of the casein IR on responses was significant only for cows in negative MP balance. A 100 g/d increment in the casein IR from its mean increased further responses in milk true protein yield by 25 g/d, compared with cows not infused with casein. Responses in blood urea concentration increased in casein studies (+0.59 mM) and the influence of the casein IR was greatest for cows in positive MP balance (0.26 vs. 0.11 mM per 100 g/d increment). Responses in DMI were also correlated negatively with responses in blood urea concentration only for cows in positive MP balance. Together, these results suggest an association between satiety and deamination and oxidation of AA supplied in excess of requirements for cows in positive MP balance. Therefore, casein stimulated appetite in cows fed MP-deficient diets possibly via the supply of orexigenic AA or through a pull effect in response to an increased metabolic demand. Conversely, casein induced satiety in cows fed diets supplying MP in excess of requirements. Not precluding other factors involved in satiety (e.g., insulin, gut peptides), casein could have increased the supply of AA (e.g., Ser, Thr, Tyr), which might depress appetite at the brain level or increase the deamination and the oxidation of AA in oversupply in agreement with the hepatic oxidation theory.

TI Enhanced Non-enzymatic amperometric sensing of glucose using
   Co(OH)2 nanorods deposited on a three dimensional graphene
   network as an electrode material
SO MICROCHIMICA ACTA
AB We report on the synthesis of cobalt dihydroxide [Co(OH)(2)] nanorods and their deposition on a 3-dimensional graphene network via chemical bath deposition. The structural characterization reveals deposited Co(OH)(2) to consist of flower-like nanorods on a 3-dimensional graphene foam. The nanocomposite was used for glucose sensing by electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose in 1 M KOH solution. Cyclic voltammetry and amperometric studies revealed a high sensitivity for glucose (3.69 mA mM(-1) cm(-2)) and a 16 nM detection limit. The nanocomposite offers a large effective surface (11.4 cm(2)) and is very selective for glucose over potentially interfering materials such as dopamine, ascorbic acid, lactose, fructose and urea, not the least due to a relatively low working potential of 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The high sensitivity, low detection limit and very good selectivity of free-standing nanocomposite electrodes are attributed to the synergistic effect of (a) the good electrocatalytic activity of the NRs, and (b) the large surface area with high conductivity offered by the 3D graphene foam.

TI Reassembly of active ammonia oxidizing bacteria following invasion of
   exogenous microbiome in an acidic soil
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB Ammonia oxidation is the rate-limiting step of the global nitrogen cycle, and it is mainly catalyzed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). AOA can carry out nitrification even in acidic soils, whereas AOB activity was not consistently observed in acidic soils. In this study, we manipulated two environmental variables, i.e., the microbial composition and ammonium source (urea and ammonium sulphate), in an acidic forest soil and tested their impacts on AOB abundance, diversity and activity. Soil microcosms were established either using the native forest soil (FS) or after amending the forest soil with 5% (w/w) agricultural soil (AFS) to inoculate new, exogenous microbes. Under the same microcosm incubation condition for 28 days, AOB did not grow in FS but they grew in AFS, suggesting that exogenous microbial invasion could stimulate AOB activity in the acidic soil. Urea amendment led to higher growth of AOB than ammonium sulphate amended in AFS microcosms. DNA -based stable isotope probing revealed that the active AOB lineages were dominated by Nitrosospira cluster 3a.2 and Nitrosospira cluster 10 in the ammonium sulphate supplied soil, but shifted to co-dominance of Nitrosospira cluster 3a.2 and Nitrosospira cluster 1 after urea amendment, demonstrating differential preferences of ammonia sources of phylogenetically distinct AOB lineages. Additionally, AOB abundance showed lower stability than AOA in soils subjected to these two environmental changes, suggesting AOB are more important in determining the fate of soil nitrification following short-term environmental disturbances.

AB Biochar activated with peroxydisulfate (PDS) has been widely applied in the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants in the environment, but its wide application is limited by expensive and complex preparation process.

The results showed that the specific surface area of NBC was 9 times that of the original, the adsorption capacity of ATZ was increased by 8 times, PDS could be effectively activated, and the removal efficiency of ATZ was as high as 98%. Density functional theory analysis proved that NBC had a lower energy barrier and a higher probability of activating PDS, thereby degrading ATZ through a non-radical pathway dominated by electron transfer. Hydroponic and pot experiments showed that NBC/PDS system effectively restored the growth status, leaf and root morphology, and chlorophyll content of plants, demonstrating the ability to efficiently remediate the toxicity of ATZ on soybean seedlings. This study not only proposed a novel biochar material as an efficient PDS activator but also provided new insights into the practical application of heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts for activating advanced oxidation processes in pollutant degradation.

TI Improved thermal stability of jute fiber as an eco-friendly precursor
   for activated carbon fiber processing
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMER RESEARCH
AB An investigation of the effect of sodium metasilicate pentahydrate and urea (in brief SMSPHU) impregnation on the thermal-oxidative stabilization of eco-friendly jute fibers was undertaken. SMSPHU integration followed by the oxidation process in the air caused major physical and structural changes. The physical and structural characterizations of the jute samples were performed employing flame test, linear density, volume density, fiber thickness, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy analysis. Development of thermal stability in the jute samples was observed from the thermogravimetric measurements. The SMSPHU impregnated jute fibers oxidized at 245 degrees C for 175 min by multistep annealing approach showed the highest value of carbon yield of 57.65% at 1000 degrees C. The infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction outcomes showed continuous decrystallization reactions because of the hydrogen bond (H-bonds) scission by progressing stabilization period. The development of the carbonyl (C = O) group was specified by the infrared analysis, which is because of the occurrence of dehydrogenation reactions and oxidative cross-linking reactions. The results suggest that the jute fibers with a stabilization period of 175 min by multistep annealing approach at 245 degrees C are expected to resist high carbonization and activation temperatures.

TI Construction of a Pt/g-C3N4/SiC Heterostructure
   for Enhanced Methanol Photoelectrooxidation
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB The performance of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) highly depends on the anode catalyst. However, it is a grand challenge to construct a potential electrocatalyst featuring high intrinsic activity, a large electrochemical surface area and outstanding photoelectrochemical function for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Herein, g-C3N4 composited with nano-SiC (g-C3N4/SiC) was prepared by evenly mixing urea and SiC followed by annealing at 550 degrees C for different times. X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area tests showed that g-C3N4 and SiC are bonded together by chemical bonds. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy characterization showed that the UV-Vis absorption edge of the g-C3N4/SiC sample is much higher than that of g-C3N4 or SiC. In addition, it was observed that an appropriate thickness of the g-C3N4 coating on the SiC surface would increase the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Therefore, the obtained Pt/g-C3N4/SiC-90 exhibits a higher photoelectrocatalytic current density and long-term stability in comparison with Pt/SiC and Pt/g-C3N4 under the same conditions. Such a catalyst with high photochemical catalytic performance is thus promising for assembly of high-performance DMFCs.

TI Inborn errors of metabolism and pregnancy
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY MFM
AB As the diagnosis and treatment of patients with inborn errors of metabolism has improved dramatically over the years, more people with these conditions are surviving into child-bearing years. Given the changes in metabolism throughout pregnancy, this time presents a unique challenge in their care. Overall metabolic shifts in pregnancy go from anabolism to catabolism driven by endocrinologic changes, along with changes in rates of gluconeogenesis, glucose consumption, amino acid transport, protein consumption, and lipid breakdown, result in a complicated metabolic picture. Additionally, maternal inborn errors of metabolism can affect a fetus, as in phenylketonuria, and fetal inborn errors of metabolism can affect the mother, as in certain fatty acid oxidation disorders. Data on these conditions is often very limited. A summary of the current literature, risks associated with pregnancy in inborn errors of metabolism, and suggestions for management of these conditions will be presented.

TI Effects of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate and dicyandiamide on nitrous
   oxide emission in a greenhouse vegetable soil
SO PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT
AB A laboratory study was conducted to determine the effect of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) and dicyandiamide (DCD) on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, mineral nitrogen (NH4+-N, NO3--N) contents, as well as ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying microbes in a greenhouse vegetable soil. Five treatments were established at 55% and 75% water filled pore space (WFPS): no fertilizer; urea; urea + manure (UM); urea + manure + DCD (UMDCD) and urea + manure + DMPP (UMDMPP). The application rate of urea and manure was 1800 kg N/ha and 1000 kg N/ha, respectively. DMPP and DCD were applied at the rate of 0.5% and 2% of urea-N application rate, respectively. Compared to UMDCD treatment, UMDMPP treatment significantly reduced N2O emission and NO3--N content and delayed ammonia oxidation, and showed a stronger inhibition effect on ammonium-oxidizing bacteria at both WFPS. Moreover, the copy numbers of nirS and nirK genes decreased significantly in the presence of DMPP at both WFPS, but were not affected by DCD. These results suggest that the application of DMPP is more effective than DCD on N2O mitigation in high N level vegetable soil, although the application rate of DMPP was one quarter that of DCD.

SO MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS
AB A series of titania-tin oxide binary nanosized mesoporous materials with various composition were successfully obtained by template assisted hydrothermal technique. They were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, XRD, TEM, XPS, UV-Vis, FTIR of adsorbed pyridine and Raman spectroscopes. The reduction properties of the composites were studied by TPR with hydrogen. Two environmental feasible processes, such as total oxidation of ethyl acetate as representative VOCs and decomposition of methanol as hydrogen source, which are also sensitive both to the surface and redox properties of the solids, were used as catalytic tests. On the base of detailed analyses of the data from the complex physicochemical study and comparison with the reference samples, obtained by homogeneous precipitation with urea, a possible mechanism of the formation of TiO2 -SnO2 binary materials was proposed and discussed in a view of catalyst design control.

TI 2D MoS2 nanosheets and hematein complexes deposited on
   screen-printed graphene electrodes as an efficient electrocatalytic
   sensor for detecting hydrazine
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB A new strategy to modify screen-printed graphene electrodes (SPGrEs) with two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (2D-MoS2) nanosheets is described. The nanomaterial confined on the electrode surface is further modified forming a ternary complex with the redox mediator hematein (HM), using Al3+ salts as mordant. The formation of this ternary complex, HM-Al3+-(2D-MoS2), gives rise to new nanostructures that can be visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resulting nanostructured platform has been characterized by electrochemical techniques. It exhibits a strong electrocatalytic activity towards hydrazine oxidation mainly due to the presence of quinone/hydroquinone moieties from the hematein and a good stability. The large value calculated for the electrocatalytic kinetic constant, (8.1 +/- 0.1) x10(4) M-1 s(-1), suggests that the presence of 2D-MoS2 nanosheets significantly improves the properties of hematein as an electron donor/acceptor. The catalytic current showed a linear dependence with the hydrazine concentration, which has allowed the development of a hydrazine sensor based on HM-Al3+-(2D-MoS2)/SPGrEs with detection and quantification limits of 1.05 mu M and 3.48 mu M, respectively. The presence of different interfering compounds such as glucose, urea and others did not significantly affect the response of the proposed hydrazine sensor. This sensor has been used for the determination of hydrazine in tap and river waters.

TI High-Performance, Adhesive-Free, Sustainable Biomass-Based Materials Via
   a Selective in Situ Oxidation Interface
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Biomass materials, such as plywood, fiberboard, and particleboard, have extensive applications in construction formwork, furniture, and decoration. However, the majority of biomass materials are joined using adhesives such as urea-formaldehyde and phenol-formaldehyde resins. Adhesive-free bonding is a sustainable method for fabricating biobased materials, which allows for the efficient use of bioresources. However, the limited adhesion strength and water resistance hinder the use of an adhesive-free method for creating high-performance biomass composites. Here, we present a straightforward and effective method for making adhesive-free biomass composites. The strategy includes selectively oxidizing biomass in situ, followed by adhesive-free bonding through one-step molding. During this process, cross-linking networks are formed within the biomass interface using covalent and hydrogen bonds. Adhesive-free biomass composites possess exceptional adhesion strength and water resistance. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits exceptional versatility in terms of raw materials, irrespective of the biomass variety or specific surface area (such as low specific surface area in wood veneer and high specific surface area in bamboo fiber or bagasse particles). Moreover, the strategy exhibits excellent surface formability, allowing for the creation of intricate pattern textures on the biomass composites during shape-forming. This strategy shows promise for converting biomass resources into sustainable and high-value-added products.

TI Sonoelectrochemical nitrided graphene nanosheets with vacancies and
   their applications for catalysis and sensing of uric acid oxidation
SO ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY
AB A sonoelectrochemical method for preparing N-doped defective graphene nanosheets (N/O-dGNs) with point defects and 5-9 or 5-8-5 vacancies and oxygen-containing groups was successfully demonstrated. In this one-pot approach, the N-bonding configuration and N content of N/O-dGNs were finely tuned by the ultrasonic power (192, 320, and 640 W). The N content in atomic percentage (at%) for N/O-dGN (N/O-dGN320W) with point defects and 5-8-5 vacancy prepared at 320 W power was 5.6 at%, greater than 3.0 at% and 2.6 at% for N/O-dGN with point defects and 5-9 vacancies at 192 W and 640 W power (N/O-dGN192W and N/O-dGN640W), respectively. N-bonding sites on N/O-dGN320W were dominantly amine N (2.1 at%) and pyrrolic N (2.4 at%). Additionally, the electrocatalytic activity of N/O-dGN192W, N/O-dGN320W, and N/O-dGN640W was successfully demonstrated for the sequential uric acid (UA) oxidation reaction (UOR), in which N/O-dGN320W displayed a significant mass activity (2.51 A/g). As in the transient catalysis of UOR, N/O-dGN320W with amine N showed 400.8 mu A mM-1 cm-2 in sensitivity within a wide linear analysis range (1.5 x 10-2-6 mM) for amperometrically sensing UA. The results of real sample experiments using serum samples further demonstrated the potential of N/ O-dGN320W as a non-enzymatic UA sensor.

TI Structures and oxygen storage/release capacities of
   CexZr1-xO2 : Effects of
   Zr content and preparation method
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Ceria-zirconia solid solution has been prepared by the urea grind combustion and citric acid sol-gel methods for catalytic applications as oxygen storage/release materials in this study. The properties and oxygen storage/release capacities of samples with different Zr contents were characterized and evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and in-situ CO-CO2 looping test. The results demonstrate that the samples prepared by two methods are all of excellent lattice [O] release/storage properties and maintain good long-term cycle stability. But the preparation method significantly impacts the homogeneity of samples related to their redox properties and the content of Zr over 20%, which greatly changed the properties of ceria-zirconia solid solutions and caused their changing of crystalline symmetry from cubic to tetragonal. The samples prepared by citric acid solgel method are of more homogeneous particle sizes and higher specific surface areas than that by urea grind combustion method, which is benefit to the oxygen release rather than oxygen storage. The bulk oxygen amount migrated to surface increases with the increasing Zr content, however, the amount of lattice oxygen migration decreases when Zr content is over 20%. When Zr content is 20%, the differences of storage/release capacities from two different preparation methods are reduced at high temperature in the long-term loop reaction.

TI Facile, Controllable, and Ultrathin NiFe-LDH In Situ Grown on a Ni Foam
   by Ultrasonic Self-Etching for Highly Efficient Urine Conversion
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB As the primary source of nitrogen pollutants in domestic sewage, urine is also an alternative for H2 production via electrochemical processes. However, it suffers from sluggish kinetics and noble-metal catalyst requirement. Here, we report a non-precious ultrathin NiFe-layered double hydroxide catalyst for the remarkable conversion of urea into N2 and H2 , which is in situ grown on a Ni foam via ultrasonic self-etching in Fe3+/ethylene glycol (EG). EG regulates the etching rate of Fe3+ , resulting in an ultrathin nanosheet structure with the aid of ultrasonication. This structure dramatically promotes the dehydrogenation process via decreasing the nanolayer thickness from 120 to 3.4 nm and leads to a 4.8-fold increase in the generation of active sites. It exhibits record urea oxidation kinetics (390.8 mAmiddotcm(-2) at 1.5 V vs RHE) with excellent stability (120 h), which is 11.8 times better than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst (33.1 mAmiddotcm(-2)). Tests with real urine at 20 mA cm(-2) achieve 74% total nitrogen removal and 2853 mu molmiddoth(-1) of H-2 production. This study provides an attractive landscape for producing H-2 by consuming urine biowastes.

TI Efficient Hydrogen Generation and Total Nitrogen Removal for Urine
   Treatment in a Neutral Solution Based on a Self-Driving Nano
   Photoelectrocatalytic System
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Urine is the main source of nitrogen pollution, while urea is a hydrogen-enriched carrier that has been ignored. Decomposition of urea to H-2 and N-2 is of great significance. Unfortunately, direct urea oxidation suffers from sluggish kinetics, and needs strong alkaline condition. Herein, we developed a self-driving nano photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) system to efficiently produce hydrogen and remove total nitrogen (TN) for urine treatment under neutral pH conditions. TiO2/WO3 nanosheets were used as photoanode to generate chlorine radicals (Cl & BULL;) to convert urea-nitrogen to N-2, which can promote hydrogen generation, due to the kinetic advantage of Cl-/Cl & BULL; cyclic catalysis. Copper nanowire electrodes (Cu NWs/CF) were employed as the cathode to produce hydrogen and simultaneously eliminate the over-oxidized nitrate-nitrogen. The self-driving was achieved based on a self-bias photoanode, consisting of confronted TiO2/WO3 nanosheets and a rear Si photovoltaic cell (Si PVC). The experiment results showed that hydrogen generation with Cl & BULL; is 2.03 times higher than in urine treatment without Cl & BULL;, generating hydrogen at 66.71 mu mol h(-1). At the same time, this system achieved a decomposition rate of 98.33% for urea in 2 h, with a reaction rate constant of 0.0359 min(-1). The removal rate of total nitrogen and total organic carbon (TOC) reached 75.3% and 48.4% in 2 h, respectively. This study proposes an efficient and potential urine treatment and energy recovery method in neutral solution.

TI Voltammetric determination of ascorbic acid by using a disposable screen
   printed electrode modified with Cu(OH)2 nanorods
SO MICROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The authors describe a disposable non-enzymatic sensor for ascorbic acid (AA) that was obtained by modifying a screen printed electrode (SPE) with Cu(OH)(2) nanorods (NRs). The NRs were synthesized by a wet chemical process which involves sequential addition of NH3 and NaOH to CuSO4 solution. NR formation was confirmed by thermogravimetric, spectroscopic, microscopic, and diffraction studies. The Cu(OH)(2) NRs were mixed with carbon ink and printed onto an SPE. Electrochemical detection of AA was carried out at pH 7.4, at a typical voltage as low as 0 mV versus saturated calomel electrode with a scan rate of 100 mV/s, and is assumed to involve the chemical reduction of Cu(II) by AA followed by electrochemical oxidation of Cu(I). The sensor has a linear response in the 0.0125 to 10 m. AA concentration range. Response to AA is free from interference by urea, glucose, uric acid, dopamine, metal ions such as Fe2+, Zn2+ and Ni2+, NaCl, KCl and ethanol. It was applied to the determination of AA in a vitamin C tablet and in urine.

TI Optimization of Pd catalysts supported on Co3O4
   for low-temperature lean combustion of residual methane
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB A series of Pd/Co3O4 catalysts with increasing palladium loading in the range of 0.5-5 wt.% was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Co3O4. Solution combustion synthesis with urea as a fuel was used to optimize the Co3O4 reactive support for palladium in the combustion of methane in lean conditions. The obtained catalysts were thoroughly examined by XRD, XPS, XRF, RS, FESEM, H2-TPR, TGA, and N2-BET techniques. The catalytic tests of CH4 combustion were performed for 0.5, 1, and 2 vol.% CH4, with constant lambda value. The obtained results revealed that a sub-stoichioinetric fuel-to-oxidizer ratio, 0.75, results in the most catalytically active Co3O4 phase. The important differences in the catalysts' activity were apparent for the highest CH4 concentration, with the 3% Pd/Co3O4 being the most active catalyst. The observed activity was explained considering the physicochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic characterization of the catalysts with the PdO nanocrystals surface distribution being the determining factor for the catalysts' reactivity. A simple model accounting for the observed dispersion effect is proposed. The model is based on a two types of the interaction of the surface PdO active phase with the Co3O4 support. Firstly, cobalt oxide helps to remove hydroxyl species from the PdO surface, thus making the active sites more available for methane activation. Secondly, cobalt spinel provides lattice oxygen to the Pd0 phase, again helping to recreate active sites thereon. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Structural variation of transition metal-organic frameworks using deep
   eutectic solvents with different hydrogen bond donors
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of material synthesis as green solvents. They have similar physical and chemical properties to the traditional ionic liquids (ILs) while being much cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Herein, seven transition metal-organic frameworks, namely [NH4][Zn(BTC)(NH3)(2)]center dot H2O (1), [Cu(PDC)(NH3)] (2), [Co(H2BTC)(2)(e-urea)(2)](e-urea)center dot 1/4H(2)O (3), K-0.63(NH4)(0.37)[Mn(PZDC)] (4), [NH4][Mn(BTC)(H2O)] (5), [CH3NH3][Mn-3(HBTC)(2)(BTC)center dot 3H(2)O (6), and [Co-3(BTC)(2)(urea)(2)]center dot 2H(2)O (7), were synthesized in deep eutectic solvents of choline chloride and urea/e-urea/m-urea (H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid; H2PDC = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid; H(2)PZDC = 3,5-pyrazoledicarboxylic acid; e-urea = ethylene urea; m-urea = N,N-dimethylurea). Of particular interest is the fact that the utilization of different hydrogen bond donors in DES mixtures can lead to the formation of different frameworks. The multiple roles of hydrogen bond donors in the reactions were discussed. Furthermore, compound 7 exhibited catalytic activity for the oxidation of styrene, and thus it can be used as a heterogeneous catalyst due to its good stability. These results promote the understanding of the application of DESs in synthesizing novel transition metal-organic frameworks.

SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB The group 6 molybdenum(II) cyclopentadienyl amidinate (CPAM) bis(carbonyl) complex [Cp*Mo{N(iPr)-C(Ph)N(iPr)}(CO)(2)] (Cp*= eta(5)-C5Me5) serves as a precatalyst for the high-yielding photocatalytic production of COS from CO and S-8 under near-ambient conditions (e.g., 10 psi, 25 degrees C). Further documented is the isolation and structural characterization of several key transition-metal intermediates which collectively support a novel molybdenum(IV)-based catalytic cycle as being operative. Finally, in the presence of an excess amount of a primary amine, it is demonstrated that this catalytic system can be successfully used for the "on-demand" generation and utilization of COS as a chemical reagent for the synthesis of ureas.

TI Nickel-Cobalt Aerogel as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Dual
   Microfluidic Applications: Hydrogen Generation and Power Energy from
   Nitrogenous Compounds
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB This research work presents a novel unsupported NiCo aerogel with high electrocatalytic activity, which was synthesized by an ultrafast method combining microwave heating and lyophilization. The novel aerogel was used as an electrocatalyst for the oxidation reactions of two different nitrogen compounds: urea and ammonium, with the aim of reducing the pollutant content in water and generating clean energy from the reduced hydrogen of oxidizing species. The NiCo aerogel was incorporated/evaluated in a microfluidic device in two ways: as an ammonium fuel cell and an alkaline urea electrolyzer, producing clean hydrogen in both systems. The unique physicochemical properties, particle size smaller than 0.1 nm, surface area of 52 m(2) g(-1), and the presence of NiCo metal alloys with the addition of species Ni-O, Ni-OH, and a higher percentage of Ni2+ enable the effective oxidation of species in the alkaline medium. Hydrogen production and power densities of up 3 x 10(-4) mu g s(-1) and 0.74 mW cm(-2), respectively, are observed. This work demonstrates for the first time an aerogel structure of non-noble metal (NiCo) used in two different microfluidic devices that oxidize nitrogenous compounds such as urea and ammonium and produce clean fuel as hydrogen.

TI Physioelectrochemical and DFT investigation of metal oxide/p-type
   conductive polymer nanoparticles as an efficient catalyst for the
   electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB In the present study, in order to achieve an inexpensive tolerable anode catalyst for direct electrooxidation of methanol, poly tyramine nanoparticles and NiO, identified by PTy-NiO, were prepared by in situ electropolymerization of tyramine in the presence of an anionic surfactant under ultrasonic irradiation. Ni(II) ions are incorporated into the electrode by immersion of the polymeric modified electrode containing amine groups in a Ni(II) ion solution and a PTy-NiO composite film is formed in the alkaline medium on the surface of the electrode. The surface morphology of the film is studied by surface microscopy techniques. The presence of nickel in the films is confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Molecular modeling calculations are carried out for polymer-Ni with density functional theory (DFT) using a 6-31G(d, p) basis set and Gaussian 03 program package. Furthermore, the experimental absorbance spectra of PTy-NiO are compared with the results obtained from Maxwell Garnett theory (MGT) and the value of energy E-g = 3.75 eV of the composite obtained. Modified graphite electrodes (G/PTy-NiO and G/PTy-SDS-NiO) are examined for their redox processes and electrocatalytic activities towards the oxidation of methanol in alkaline solutions. Compared with G/PTy-NiO, the G/PTy-SDS-NiO electrode shows a higher catalytic performance in the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. A kinetic model was developed and the kinetic parameters were calculated using the methanol concentration dependency of charge transfer resistance derived from the impedance studies.

TI Tailoring the photoelectrochemistry of catalytic

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Apart from being key structures of modern microelectronics, metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) junctions are highly promising electrodes for artificial leaves, i.e. photoelectrochemical cells that can convert sunlight into energy-rich fuels. Here, we demonstrate that homogeneous Si/SiOx/Ni MIS junctions, employed as photoanodes, can be functionalized with a redox-active species and simultaneously converted into high-photovoltage inhomogeneous MIS junctions by electrochemical dissolution. We also report on the considerable enhancement of performance towards urea oxidation, induced by this process. Finally, we demonstrate that both phenomena can be employed synergistically to design highly-efficient Si-based photoanodes. These findings open doors for the manufacturing of artificial leaves that can generate H-2 under solar illumination using contaminated water.

TI Nanostructured nickel-cobalt oxide and sulfide for applications in
   supercapacitors and green energy production using waste water
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB With the advancement in technology, the demand for green energy production and storage is increasing year by year. To meet the increasing demand for green energy, there has been continuous research in a bid to find better materials and efficient ways to store energy. Supercapacitors continue to show a promising green energy storage capacity with their modified and improved electrode materials, which show better electrochemical properties. Transition metals such as Fe, Mo, Ni, etc. based materials have shown great potential for electrode materials in supercapacitors, electrocatalysts for water splitting, and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this work, nanostructured nickel-cobalt oxide and nickel-cobalt sulfide were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method for their applications in a supercapacitor, water splitting, and urea oxidation reaction. It was observed that the properties of nickel-cobalt oxide improved significantly after converting it to nickel-cobalt sulfide. The energy storage capacity of nickel-cobalt sulfide was significantly enhanced compared to nickel-cobalt oxide. Additionally, nickel-cobalt sulfide showed an overpotential of 282 mV, while nickel-cobalt oxide displayed an overpotential of 379 mV to generate a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), towards oxygen evolution reaction. After the introduction of 0.33 M urea, the potential for oxidation of urea for both nickel-cobalt oxide and nickel-cobalt sulfide was reduced significantly.

TI Synthesis of Hierarchically Porous Nitrogen-Doped Carbon for Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB In this work, a facile synthetic strategy is developed for the preparation of nitrogen-doped (N-doped) hierarchically porous carbon materials. During the preparation process, sodium citrate and urea serve as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, without any template or additional activation reagents. Both the microstructure and nitrogen dopant content of the porous carbon can be tuned. The as-prepared porous carbon materials are tested as anodes in sodium-ion batteries. The porous N-doped carbon prepared at 650 degrees C shows a high reversible capacity of 305.7 mAhg(-1) at a current density of 0.1 Ag-1. Even at a higher current density of 8.0 Ag-1, a specific capacity of 164.5 mAhg(-1) is obtained. After 500 cycles, the specific capacity of the electrode remains as high as 219 mAhg(-1) at a current density of 1.0 Ag-1. This synthetic strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for preparing heteroatom-doped porous carbon in energy storage and other fields.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY

CL Seattle, WA
AB N-G-Hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA) is a stable intermediate product in the urea cycle that can be used to monitor the consumption of L-arginine by nitrous oxide synthase (NOS) to produce nitric oxide (NO) and L-citrulline. Research has implicated the urea cycle in many diseases and NO has cultivated interest as a potential biomarker for neural health. Electrochemical detection is an established, cost-effective method that can successfully detect low levels of analyte concentrations. As one of the few electrochemically active species in the urea cycle, NOHA shows promise as a biomarker for monitoring disruptions in this biochemical process. In this study, we show that NOHA has an oxidation peak at +355 mV vs Ag/AgCl at a glassy carbon electrode. In addition, cyclic voltammetry studies with structural analogs-alanine and N-hydroxyguanidine-allowed us to approximate the oxidation wave at +355 mV vs Ag/AgCl to be a one electron process. Diffusivity of NOHA was found using linear scan voltammetry with a rotating disk electrode and approximated at 5.50 x 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1). Ample work is still needed to make a robust biosensor, but the results here characterize the electrochemical activity and represent principle steps in making a NOHA biosensor. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

   NiCo2O4-NiO biphasic microspheres as effective
   electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB In this study, NiCo2O4-NiO nanomaterials with two different morphologies were synthesized using urea and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as structure directing agents. A combination of analytical techniques including XRD, XPS, SEM-EDX, TEM, and BET were utilized for the characterization of the materials. Microscopy images show that urea-stabilized NiCo2O4-NiO (UeNiCo) has urchin-like morphology assembled by nanowires, and CTAC stabilization (C-NiCo) led to the formation of microspheres with nanoplate assembly. In addition, both wires and plates are formed by the assembly of individual NiCo2O4-NiO nanoparticles. Then, glassy carbon electrodes were modified with these hierarchical nanomaterials, and their electrochemical behavior in oxygen evolution reaction was investigated in 0.1 M KOH solution. Although both of the materials had similar onset potentials (1.56 V vs RHE for U-NiCo and 1.57 V vs RHE for C-NiCo), U-NiCo could drive 10 mA cm(-2) of current density at a lower overpotential value (387 mV) than C-NiCo (430 mV). Both of the materials demonstrated impressive kinetic performance with low Tafel slopes (49 mV dec(-1) for U-NiCo and 44 mV dec(-1) for C-NiCo) and good stability during long-term constant potential electrolysis. In addition, NiCo2O4-NiO nanomaterials outperformed RuO2 at high catalytic current densities (i.e., eta(50) = 518 mV for U-NiO and eta(50) = 622 mV for RuO2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB In this work, N-Ni1Co3Mn0.4O/NF is synthesized as multifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). The optimal Ni/Co (molar ratio) and the amount of doping Mn are investigated, the sample with Ni/Co = 1:3 and the addition of 0.4 mmol Mn exhibits the best catalytic activity with the largest specific surface area. Then the two-electrode electrolyzers composed of NNi1Co3Mn0.4O/NF are constructed, and the results from experiments show that the voltage required for overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) at 100 mA cm-2 is 0.272 V, 1.614 V lower than that of overall water splitting (OWS, 1.886 V), while the overall urea splitting (OUS) needs 1.669 V, 0.187 V lower than that of OWS, revealing the outstanding thermodynamic and kinetic advantages of OUS and OHzS. The superior performance may be attributed to the heterostructure between metal and metal oxide and N-doping, which can promote electron transfer and optimizes the decomposition of urea and hydrazine hydrate and hydrogen production, and the research on mechanism will be carried out in the future.

AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process. Herein, h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was designed through a chemical vapor deposition method using boron acid and urea as precursors, which was used for ODHP reaction and exhibited a similar to 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity towards propylene, with only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2, at temperature of 535 degrees C and a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 576,000 mL/g(BN)h. The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 g(C3H6)g(BN)(-1) h(-1) and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation. Meanwhile, the high GHSV and excellent thermal conductivity of h-BN contribute to the heat transfer during reactions.

Results indicated that addition of urea and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) effectively enhanced the degradation of TC. When the mass ratio of graphite/ urea/NaHCO3 and pyrolysis temperature was 1: 2: 2 and 800 degrees C, respectively, the obtained catalyst had optimal performance for activating PMS to TC degradation. The degradation efficiency of TC reached 99.8% within 30 min under the conditions of 0.10 g/L catalyst, 0.20 g/L PMS and 20 mg/L TC solution. Results suggested that the catalyst had well catalytic repeatability, versatility and adaptability under different conditions. The radical quenching test, electrochemistry experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements sug-gested that superoxide radical (O2 center dot-) and singlet oxygen (1O2) plays dominant roles in TC degradation. XPS indicated that pyridine N, graphite N and functional groups of C--O and -COOH were the potential active sites for PMS activation. This provides new insights for the recycling of solid waste and preparation of high-performance carbon based catalysts for wastewater treatment via Fenton-like process.

TI Analysis of kidney proteomes to identify biological pathways associated
   with vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity in mice by tandem mass
   tag-labeled quantitative and parallel reaction monitoring
   phosphoproteomics
SO HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
AB Vancomycin (VCM)-induced nephrotoxicity impedes its treatment applications. Thus, it is important to clarify the relevant mechanism. This study investigated phosphoprotein changes attributable to the VCM nephrotoxicity mechanisms. Biochemical, pathological and phosphoproteomic analyses based on C57BL/6 mice were performed to explore the mechanisms. VCM-treated mice showed increased levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and signs of acute tubular necrotic lesions. Phosphoproteomic profiling identified 3025 differentially phosphorylated phosphopeptides between the model and control group. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated that Molecular Function "oxidoreductase activity" and Cellular Component "peroxisome" were markedly enriched. KEGG pathway analysis identified an enrichment in peroxisome pathway and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) signaling pathways. Parallel reaction monitoring analysis revealed a significant downregulation of CAT, SOD-1, AGPS, DHRS4, and EHHADH at phosphorylation level by VCM. Notably, the phosphorylation of ACO, AMACR, and SCPX was downregulated by VCM, which are the fatty acid beta-oxidation-related proteins involved in PPAR signaling pathways. The phosphorylated PEX5 involved in peroxisome biogenesis was upregulated by VCM. Collectively, these findings indicated that VCM-induced nephrotoxicity is closely associated with peroxisome pathway and PPAR signaling pathways. The current study provides important insight into the mechanisms of VCM nephrotoxicity and will aid in the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies against this nephropathy.

TI The dispersibility of Cellulose I and Cellulose II
SO CERNE
AB Background: The restricted dispersibility of cellulose in water has grown to be a significant problem which is a key step in making cellulose soluble in water and common solvent. To overcome the obstacle, cellulose structure is being modified to improve the surface properties and the utilization of the cellulose itself. In this study, cellulose I and cellulose II were examined after treated with watersoluble 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO). The hydrogen bond between chains and the crystallinity of the cotton linter (cellulose I) was first broken by NaOH/urea. Then, cellulose I and NaOH/urea-treated cellulose (cellulose II) were oxidized with sodium chlorite, sodium bromide, and TEMPO in a catalytic amount. Results: The success of oxidation is achieved when both cellulose I and II treated with TEMPO had preferentially converted the hydroxyl groups to carboxylate groups through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). Besides, through X-ray diffraction analysis, cellulose I and II exhibited a decreased in the crystallinity. The scattered structure revealed through morphology analysis proved that cellulose treated with TEMPO had resulted in a more dispersed and separated cellulose fibre structure. Conclusion: The result showed, cellulose has been successfully modified using TEMPO -mediated oxidation with improved dispersion properties. The scattered structure revealed through morphology analysis proved that cellulose treated with TEMPO had resulted in a more dispersed and separated cellulose fibre structure. High cellulose dispersion ability will allow the manufacturing process of hydrogel, film and fibre to be much easier and faster. This is necessary for creating novel, environmentally friendly materials for various applications across numerous industries and future research anticipated to increase.

TI Nitrification and nitrous oxide dynamics in the Southern California
   Bight
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The amount of primary production fueled by upwelled "new" nitrate can be used to estimate the amount of organic carbon available for export to the deep ocean. Nitrate production in the euphotic zone from the microbial process of nitrification affects these estimates, yet the controls on nitrification in the upper ocean are debated. This study examines how seasonal cycles in primary production influence rates of nitrification fueled by both ammonia and urea-derived nitrogen (N), and how these processes relate to the distribution of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) using monthly rate measurements from the San Pedro Ocean Time-series (SPOT) station. Nitrification rates were highest at the onset of upwelling and were correlated with depth-integrated primary production in the lower euphotic zone. Similar ammonia and urea-derived N oxidation rates suggest urea is a significant N source fueling nitrification, particularly below the euphotic zone. Nitrification supplied a large proportion of phytoplankton N demand in the lower euphotic zone, implying significant regenerated production. The Southern California Bight was always a source of N2O to the atmosphere, which likely was advected into the system from the eastern tropical North Pacific, rather than produced locally from nitrification, and ventilated to the atmosphere during upwelling. Together, the results suggest the coupling of N remineralization and primary production in the upper ocean have important implications for the amount of organic carbon available for export out of the surface ocean, but that transport may dominate over local production in explaining local N2O dynamics.

TI Efficient energy-saving hydrogen production on binder-free
   electrodeposited hierarchical Ni-Mn-P@Ni-Co nanostructure
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Synthesis of optimized active and stable electrocatalyst represents a significant and crucial obstacle in producing green hydrogen. Additionally, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) poses a significant challenge in the sustainable production of hydrogen, mainly because of its sluggish nature. In this research, the electrodeposition technique was used for synthesizing the hierarchical Ni-Mn-P@Ni-Co nanostructure and its electrocatalytic behavior was explored for hydrogen evolution and urea electro-oxidation reactions (HER and UOR). Electro-chemical analysis revealed that by utilizing a high surface area and favorable intrinsic activity, electrodes that demonstrated remarkable electrocatalytic activity and performance were created through the fabrication pro -cess. For delivering the 10 mA cm-2 current density, the Ni-Mn-P@Ni-Co electrode needed only 70 mV over-potential in HER and 1.309 V vs RHE in UOR. Furthermore, substituting the UOR with OER also resulted in an enhancement of hydrogen production efficiency. During overall urea electrolysis, the cell voltage in 10 mA cm-2 was only 1.395 V which, is 200 mV lower than the HER-OER process.

TI Human Urine-Fueled Light-Driven NADH Regeneration for Redox Biocatalysis
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Human urine is considered as an alternative source of hydrogen and electricity owing to its abundance and high energy density. Here we show the utility of human urine as a chemical fuel for driving redox biocatalysis in a photoelectrochemical cell. Ni(OH)(2)-modified -Fe2O3 is selected as a photoanode for the oxidation of urea in human urine and black silicon (bSi) is used as a photocathode material for nicotinamide cofactor (NADH: hydrogenated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) regeneration. The electrons extracted from human urine are used for the regeneration of NADH, an essential hydride mediator that is required for numerous redox biocatalytic reactions. The catalytic reactions at both the photoanode and the photocathode were significantly enhanced by light energy that lowered the overpotential and generated high currents in the full cell system.

TI Transformation of microwave synthesized highly uniform FeMo-MIL-88B
   nanorod to oxynitride derivate for overall water splitting reaction
SO APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY
AB In search of inexpensive and efficient electrocatalyst for water electrolysis, three strategies to bring out the full potential of the most earth abundant transition metal, iron, are explored: MOF-templated morphology control, secondary metal incorporation, and nitrogen doping. This paper describes an ultrafast microwave-assisted synthesis of FeMo-MIL-88B followed by self-templated calcination via soft-urea path. The transformed 3D rod-shaped porous iron-molybdenum oxynitride (FeMoON) presents outstanding electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting. The FeMoON electrode affords high current densities of 850 mA cm(-1) at an overpotential of merely 364 mV for OER and 750 mA cm(-1) at an overpotential of 400 mV for HER. The overall water-splitting demeanor surpasses that of commercial noble metal pair in high current densities and shows potential for long-term stability. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Natural cellulose supported carbon nanotubes and Fe3O4 NPs as
   the efficient peroxydisulfate activator for the removal of bisphenol A:
   An enhanced non-radical oxidation process
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Currently, many catalysts are inconvenient to separate from water, and the solvents used in the preparation process are not environmentally friendly, resulting in low recovery efficiency and secondary pollution. In this study, the magnetic and porous regenerated cellulose/carbon nanotubes/Fe3O4 nanoparticles (RC/CNTs/Fe3O4 NPs) composites were synthesized for activation of peroxydisulfate (PDS) in a green alkaline-urea system. The RC/CNTs/Fe3O4 NPs-PDS system achieved 100% removal of bisphenol A compared with CNTs (-64.6%), RC (-0%) or Fe3O4 NPs (-0%), which was closely related to the introduction of defects and functional groups, nitrogen doping and conductive networks. Interestingly, the strong interaction between CNTs and the sheath-like protective layer formed by urea on the cellulose surface promotes the introduction of nitrogen into the composites at the preparation temperature of 70 degrees C. Moreover, the mechanism of the system was found to be a typical non-radical pathway. Fortunately, there is no leaching of iron ions in the system, and the effects of the actual waterbody, initial pH, and different anions are negligible. The recycling and separation experiments revealed the practicality and superiority of the composite. This work provides a feasible and sustainable strategy for the application of natural cellulose-supported catalysts.

TI Preparation and Characterization of Bacterial Cellulose-Carbon Dot
   Hybrid Nanopaper for Potential Sensing Applications
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Green and facile approaches aiming at the manufacture of biocompatible paper-based optical sensors reporting the presence of photoluminescence (PL) modulating compounds is an emerging field of research. This study investigates the preparation of bacterial cellulose nanopaper containing covalently immobilized carbon dots for potential biosensing applications. Preliminary work of this feasibility study included TEMPO-mediated ((2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl-mediated) oxidation and nanofibrillation of bacterial cellulose (TOBC) on the one hand as well as synthesis and comparative analysis of different types of carbon dots (CDs) on the other hand. The two source materials of the targeted functional nanopaper were finally linked to each other by two different N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) coupling approaches to clarify whether grafting of CDs prior to or after TOBC paper formation would be the method of choice. Synthesis of the carbon nanodots was accomplished by microwave-assisted co-hydrothermolysis of appropriate precursor compounds. After isolation and purification by dialysis particles in the single-digit nanometer-range were obtained and characterized with regard to their photoluminescence properties in terms of emission wavelength, pH stability, and quantum yield. All types of synthesized CDs reached their PL maxima (450-480 nm; light blue) in a narrow excitation wavelength range of 340-360 nm. Variation of molar (C/N) ratio of the CD precursors and substitution of the nitrogen donor EDEA by urea increased PL and quantum yield (QY), respectively. The highest relative QY of nearly 32% was obtained for CDs synthesized from citric acid and urea. PL of all CDs was virtually insensitive to pH changes in the range of 4-10. Tensile testing of hybrid nanopaper prepared after EDC/NHS-mediated grafting of GEA-type CDs onto TOBC (0.52 mmol.g(-1) COOH) in dispersion state revealed that both stiffness and strength are not compromised by incorporation of carbon dots, while plastic deformation and elongation at break increased slightly compared to nanopaper formed prior to decoration with CDs. Water contact angle of the nanopaper is unaffected by introduction of carbon dots which is supposedly due to the presence of surface amino- and amide groups compensating for the loss of carboxyl groups by grafting.

TI Comammox Nitrospira Clade B is the most abundant complete ammonia
   oxidizer in a dairy pasture soil and inhibited by dicyandiamide and high
   ammonium concentrations
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB The recent discovery of comammox Nitrospira, a complete ammonia oxidizer, capable of completing the nitrification on their own has presented tremendous challenges to our understanding of the nitrification process. There are two divergent clades of comammox Nitrospira, Clade A and B. However, their population abundance, community structure and role in ammonia and nitrite oxidation are poorly understood. We conducted a 94-day microcosm study using a grazed dairy pasture soil amended with urea fertilizers, synthetic cow urine, and the nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), to investigate the growth and community structure of comammox Nitrospira spp. We discovered that comammox Nitrospira Clade B was two orders of magnitude more abundant than Clade A in this fertile dairy pasture soil and the most abundant subcluster was a distinctive phylogenetic uncultured subcluster Clade B2. We found that comammox Nitrospira Clade B might not play a major role in nitrite oxidation compared to the role of canonical Nitrospira nitrite-oxidizers, however, comammox Nitrospira Clade B is active in nitrification and the growth of comammox Nitrospira Clade B was inhibited by a high ammonium concentration (700 kg synthetic urine-N ha(-1)) and the nitrification inhibitor DCD. We concluded that comammox Nitrospira Clade B: (1) was the most abundant comammox in the dairy pasture soil; (2) had a low tolerance to ammonium and can be inhibited by DCD; and (3) was not the dominant nitrite-oxidizer in the soil. This is the first study discovering a new subcluster of comammox Nitrospira Clade B2 from an agricultural soil.

TI Multi-omics analysis reveals regulators of the response to nitrogen
   limitation in Yarrowia lipolytica
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous ascomycete yeast that stores lipids in response to limitation of nitrogen. While the enzymatic pathways responsible for neutral lipid accumulation in Y. lipolytica are well characterized, regulation of these pathways has received little attention. We therefore sought to characterize the response to nitrogen limitation at system-wide levels, including the proteome, phosphoproteome and metabolome, to better understand how this organism regulates and controls lipid metabolism and to identify targets that may be manipulated to improve lipid yield.
   Results: We found that ribosome structural genes are down-regulated under nitrogen limitation, during which nitrogen containing compounds (alanine, putrescine, spermidine and urea) are depleted and sugar alcohols and TCA cycle intermediates accumulate (citrate, fumarate and malate). We identified 1219 novel phosphorylation sites in Y. lipolytica, 133 of which change in their abundance during nitrogen limitation. Regulatory proteins, including kinases and DNA binding proteins, are particularly enriched for phosphorylation. Within lipid synthesis pathways, we found that ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase are phosphorylated during nitrogen limitation while many of the proteins involved in beta-oxidation are down-regulated, suggesting that storage lipid accumulation may be regulated by phosphorylation of key enzymes. Further, we identified short DNA elements that associate specific transcription factor families with up- and down-regulated genes.
   Conclusions: Integration of metabolome, proteome and phosphoproteome data identifies lipid accumulation in response to nitrogen limitation as a two-fold result of increased production of acetyl-CoA from excess citrate and decreased capacity for beta-oxidation.

TI Interface engineering of S-doped Co2P@Ni2P
   core-shell heterostructures for efficient and energy-saving water
   splitting
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Electrochemical hydrogen production is largely limited by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Urea-assisted energy-saving alkaline hydrogen production has been promising alternative pathway. Herein, we demonstrate an ion-exchange strategy to fabricate cobalt phosphide nanowire decorated with nickel phosphide nanosheets core@shell heterostructured arrays with sulfur doping at the interface (S-Co2P@Ni2P) for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Interfacial S-doping induces charge transfer from S-Co2P to Ni2P in the heterostructure, generating electron-rich Ni centers and electron-deficient Co centers to be active sites for HER and UOR, respectively, with optimized absorption/desorption energies of reactants/products to accelerate the catalytic kinetics of HER and UOR. As a result, S-Co2P@Ni2P requires an overpotential of 103 mV and potential of 1.36 V (vs. RHE) to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) for HER and UOR, respectively, and drives the full urea electrolysis at 1.43 V to deliver current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

TI Energy-Saving Electrochemical Hydrogen Production on Dynamic Hydrogen
   Bubble-Template Electrodeposited Ni-Cu-Mn Nano-Micro Dendrite
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Replacing an oxidation reaction with lower potential than OER can significantly reduce the cell potential in the hydrogen production process. Here, we synthesized Ni-Cu-Mn alloy nano-micro dendrites using one-step and binder-free dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) electrochemical deposition method and studied its activity for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical results for HER represented that the eta (10) for the optimized electrode is 63 mV and its Tafel slope is 111 mV.dec(-1). Also, the results of polarization tests showed that by replacing the OER process with UOR, in the overall water splitting process, to create a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) the cell potential reaches 1.361 V, which is 179 mV less than HER-OER. Also, the results of electrocatalytic stability represented small changes in overpotential during the electrolysis process, which indicates the unique electrocatalytic stability. The improvement of electrocatalytic results in this study is due to the fabrication of a binder-free and three-dimensional surface as well as the synergistic effect caused by elements in improving the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. This study revealed that the use of DHBT method can be used effectively to synthesizing active and cost-effective bi-functional electrocatalysts for HER-UOR.

TI <SUP>15</SUP>N-DNA stable isotope probing reveals niche differentiation
   of ammonia oxidizers in paddy soils
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Chemoautotrophic canonical ammonia oxidizers (ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)) and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox Nitrospira) are accountable for ammonia oxidation, which is a fundamental process of nitrification in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the relationship between autotrophic nitrification and the active nitrifying populations during N-15-urea incubation has not been totally clarified. The N-15-labeled DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) technique was utilized in order to study the response from the soil nitrification process and the active nitrifying populations, in both acidic and neutral paddy soils, to the application of urea. The presence of C2H2 almost completely inhibited NO3--N production, indicating that autotrophic ammonia oxidation was dominant in both paddy soils. N-15-DNA-SIP technology could effectively distinguish active nitrifying populations in both soils. The active ammonia oxidation groups in both soils were significantly different, AOA (NS (Nitrososphaerales)-Alpha, NS-Gamma, NS-Beta, NS-Delta, NS-Zeta and NT (Ca. Nitrosotaleales)-Alpha), and AOB (Nitrosospira) were functionally active in the acidic paddy soil, whereas comammox Nitrospira clade A and Nitrosospira AOB were functionally active in the neutral paddy soil. This study highlights the effective discriminative effect of N-15-DNA-SIP and niche differentiation of nitrifying populations in these paddy soils.

TI Controlled synthesis of Ni nanoparticles embedded within N-doped carbon
   nanotubes for electrochemical nonenzymatic glucose sensing
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Constructing a cost-effective glucose sensor has attracted the attention of researchers, since the detection of blood glucose level play a critical role on determining diabetes. The electrochemical nonenzymatic glucose sensor has the advantages of good stability, high sensitivity and low fabrication cost, compared with enzymebased glucose sensors. Herein, the Ni nanoparticles embedded within N-doped carbon nanotubes was prepared by high-temperature pyrolysis of precursor composed of NiCl2 and dicyandiamide, namely Ni@NC700. Benefiting from the abundant Ni3+ active species from electrooxidation of Ni nanoparticles and the large specific surface area and electrical conductivity of Ni@NC700, the nonenzymatic sensor presented a remarkable electrocatalytic glucose oxidation performance. The resulting Ni@NC700 exhibited a high sensitivity of 299.65 mu A mM- 1 cm- 2, a fast response time of 1.36 s, and a low detection limit of 1.1 mu M. In addition, the Ni@NC700 showed the excellent anti-interference ability in the presence of dopamine, KCl, urea, NaCl, uric acid, ascorbic acid, sucrose, and maltose interferences. In addition, the sensor exhibited good stability and satisfactory reproducibility (RSD of 1 %). The successful synthesis of the Ni nanoparticles embedded within N-doped carbon nanotubes provided intensive insight on high-efficiency electrochemical nonenzymatic glucose sensing.

TI Conformal electrochemical deposition of intermetallic AuCu thin films
   for convergent C-N coupling
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Intermetallic AuCu alloy thin films were grown electrochemically onto Ti foil substrates and exhibited enhanced selectivity and activity for electrochemical C-N coupling to form urea (CO(NH2)2) compared to their parent metals. Varying the Au and Cu stoichiometry provided a synthetic handle to tune the film electronics (i.e., d-band position, oxophilicity) while maintaining overall film stability. The AuCu alloy with the highest Au loading of 75% proved to be the most electrochemically stable and possessed the highest selectivity (similar to 68%) for urea formation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that the Cu in alloys with more Au content maintained a higher oxidation state (in the form of Cu-O) under electrochemically relevant conditions. This observation suggests enhanced anion (NO3-/NO2-) adsorption and retention at the surface. This work highlights the utility of using intermetallic alloys to enable complex electrochemical coupling reactions by finely tuning material properties.

TI Influences of oxidation ability on precision in nitrogen isotope
   measurements of organic reference materials using elemental
   analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry
SO RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Rationale The precision of the standard measurements of reference materials (RMs) is critical to normalize the raw delta N-15 values of samples to the international scale. Because the measurement configuration is required to moderate the properties of both RMs and samples for obtaining an ideal measurement precision, it is important to determine the appropriate measurement configurations of RMs to achieve accurate nitrogen isotope compositions of samples. Therefore, it is critical to systematically examine RMs for optimizing the configurations and further improve the measurement precision.
   Methods Gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) coupled with an online elemental analyzer (EA) equipped with a single-quartz reactor was performed to analyze the nitrogen isotope compositions. Some adjustments were made as follows: (a) as the in-house working standard, urea was used to investigate the influences of combustion through moderating the different oxygen injections (0-20 mL) and sample delay times (10-12 s) and optimize the combustion conditions to enhance oxidation ability; (b) CO2 from the sample gas stream was removed to prevent interferences between CO2 and N-2; (c) international RMs, including USGS40 (l-glutamic), IAEA600 (caffeine), and soil standard (B2153) with a low organic content, were systematically analyzed under the optimized configurations, and the precisions of the delta N-15 values were further examined.
   Results Our results showed that sufficient oxygen should be injected to improve the sample combustion when analyzing delta N-15 in natural samples such as soil or marine sediment with low organic content. In addition, the measurement precision of delta N-15 was affected by the tailing of the CO2 peak from the gas chromatography column into the subsequent sample measurement if the EA is equipped with a single-quartz reactor column. Our adjustments can produce an optimized repeatability and accuracy of the delta N-15 value, especially for RMs with low organic content, and the uncertainty of the measurements is improved to be better than 0.1 parts per thousand under optimized configurations.
   Conclusions The analytical conditions such as the oxygen flow rate and injection time or sample introduction time into the EA need to be adjusted depending on the combustion conditions of the RMs and samples to obtain a reliable accuracy of measurement. We recommend that when analyzing delta N-15 of natural samples such as soil or marine sediment samples with low organic content, more oxygen should be injected to improve the combustion of the samples. In addition, CO2 should be removed from the sample gas stream before being introduced into the isotope ratio mass spectrometer when the EA is equipped with a single-quartz reactor.

TI All-Cellulose Composite Laminates Made from Wood-Based Textiles: Effects
   of Process Conditions and the Addition of TEMPO-Oxidized Nanocellulose
SO POLYMERS
AB All-cellulose composites (ACCs) are manufactured using only cellulose as a raw material. Biobased materials are more sustainable alternatives to the petroleum-based composites that are used in many technical and life-science applications. In this study, an aquatic NaOH-urea solvent system was used to produce sustainable ACCs from wood-based woven textiles with and without the addition of TEMPO-oxidized nanocellulose (at 1 wt.-%). This study investigated the effects of dissolution time, temperature during hot press, and the addition of TEMPO-oxidized nanocellulose on the mechanical and thermal properties of the composites. The results showed a significant change in the tensile properties of the layered textile composite at dissolution times of 30 s and 1 min, while ACC elongation was the highest after 2 and 5 min. Changes in hot press temperature from 70 degrees C to 150 degrees C had a significant effect: with an increase in hot press temperature, the tensile strength increased and the elongation at break decreased. Incorporating TEMPO-oxidized nanocellulose into the interface of textile layers before partial dissolution improved tensile strength and, even more markedly, the elongation at break. According to thermal analyses, textile-based ACCs have a higher storage modulus (0.6 GPa) and thermal stabilization than ACCs with nanocellulose additives. This study highlights the important roles of process conditions and raw material characteristics on the structure and properties of ACCs.

TI Steam Reforming of Bio-Ethanol to Produce Hydrogen over
   Co/CeO2 Catalysts Derived from
   Ce1-xCoxO2-y
   Precursors
SO CATALYSTS
AB A series of Ce1-xCoxO2-y precursors were prepared by homogeneous precipitation using urea as a precipitant. The Co/CeO2 catalysts obtained from the Ce1-xCoxO2-y precursors were used for the steam reforming of ethanol to produce hydrogen. Co ions could enter the CeO2 lattices to form Ce1-xCoxO2-y mixed oxides at x 0.2 using the homogeneous precipitation (hp) method. CeO2 was an excellent support for Co metal in the steam reforming of ethanol because a strong interaction between support and metal (SISM) exists in the Co/CeO2 catalysts. Because Co/CeO2 (hp) prepared by homogeneous precipitation possessed a high BET surface area and small Co metal particles, Co/CeO2 (hp) showed a higher ethanol conversion than the Co/CeO2 catalysts prepared using the co-precipitation (cp) method and the impregnation (im) method. The selectivity of CO2 over Co/CeO2 (hp) increased with increasing reaction temperature at from 573 to 673 K, and decreased with increasing reaction temperature above 673 K due to the increase of CO formation. The carbonaceous deposits formed on the catalyst surface during the reaction caused a slow deactivation in the steam reforming of ethanol over Co/CeO2 (hp). The catalytic activity of the used catalysts could be regenerated by an oxidation-reduction treatment, calcined in air at 723 K and then reduced by H-2 at 673 K.

TI Concerted methane fixation at ambient temperature and pressure mediated
   by an alcohol oxidase and Fe-ZSM-5 catalytic couple
SO NATURE CATALYSIS
AB Anthropogenic methane emissions, particularly from diffuse and dilute sources, pose a significant challenge for oxidation and valorization as existing methane oxidation routes rely on high temperatures or pressures. Here we report the catalytic coupling of alcohol oxidase with the iron-modified ZSM-5 (Fe-ZSM-5) zeolite catalyst, creating a tandem methanotrophic system that partially oxidizes methane at ambient temperatures and pressures. Methane reacts at Fe-ZSM-5 to produce methanol, which is then oxidized at the enzyme to formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The latter subsequently reacts back at Fe-ZSM-5 and oxidizes methane in a catalytic couple. We show that methane-to-formaldehyde selectivity can exceed 90% at room temperature. The generated formaldehyde was rapidly incorporated into a growing urea polymer, with a material growth rate exceeding 5.0 mg gcat-1 h-1, which matches or exceeds the growth rates of many methanotrophic organisms. This work presents a sustainable route for methane oxidation, driven by oxygen in the air under ambient conditions, producing high-value polymers and valorizing methane emission streams.
   The development of catalytic systems for sequestering anthropogenic methane emissions from the atmosphere could potentially reduce global warming. Now, coupling the enzyme alcohol oxidase with an inorganic zeolite generates formaldehyde from methane under ambient conditions with 90% selectivity.

TI Oxidation of olefins using molecular oxygen catalyzed by a part per

SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB Copper catalysts with an imidazole salt tag ([Cu-Imace-R-H][X], X- = F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, CF3CO2-, HSO4-, NO3-, PF6- or BF4-; R = H or CH3) show quite high reactivity for the oxidation of non-aromatic olefins with good selectivity for epoxides. The reactions perform well with a part per million (ppm) catalyst loading at mild temperature and ambient pressure. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) reaches up to 900 000 h(-1). The catalytic activity is easy to control by changing the anion of [Cu-Imace-R-H][X]. This catalyst is effective for a series of substrates, including internal and terminal olefins, tri- and tetra-substituted olefins and aromatic olefins. In addition, the copper catalyst can be conveniently separated from the reaction system and reused for at least six cycles without any obvious loss of catalytic activity.

TI Nitrogen availability in biochar-based fertilizers depending on
   activation treatment and nitrogen source
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Different activation and N-doping treatments were used to produce biochar-based fertilizers (BBFs) with increased N concentration and slow N release. Pristine biochars were produced by pyrolysis of olive tree pruning feedstock at low and high temperatures (400 and 800 degrees C). These biochars were activated either by ultra-sonication, or oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or nitric acid (HNO3) to increase their N retention potential. Subsequently biochars were enriched with N with either urea or ammonium sulfate. The activation of low-temperature biochars with HNO3 was the most effective treatment leading to new surface carboxylic groups that facilitated the later enrichment with N. When treated with urea, BBFs reached 7.0 N%, whereas the H2O2 activation only allowed an increase up to 2.0 N%. The use of urea as the external N source was the most efficient for incorporating N. Urea treated biochars had a water-soluble fraction that represented up to 14.5 % of the total N. The hydrolyzable N fraction, composed by amides and simple N heterocycles originated by the N-doping treatments, and nitro groups generated from HNO3 activation represented up to 60 % of the total N. This study relates the N chemical forms in the new BBFs to potential N availability in soil. The presence of water-soluble, hydrolyzable and non-hydrolyzable N implied that these BBFs may supply N that would be progressively available for plants, acting as slow-release fertilizers.

   TiO2 as photo catalysts for amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin
   photo-degradation under solar irradiation
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS
   SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have gained traction as alternative solutions for eliminating pollutants from pharmaceutical wastewater for reuse. In this research, the performance of two photo-catalysts (Commercial TiO2 and synthesis N-doped TiO2) were compared in terms of the degradation of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin from an aqueous solution using a photo-catalytic batch system under solar irradiation. The influence of five operating factors is: pH (5-11), H2O2 concentrations (200-600) mg/L, catalyst concentrations (25-100 mg/L), Antibiotic concentration (25-100) mg/L and reaction time (30-120 min), on the oxidation of the listed above pollutants were investigated using the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). The catalyst of N-doping TiO2 was synthesized by sol-gel method, using the urea (CH4N2O) as a nitrogen source. The resulting material was analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Additionally, it can be observed from the analysis of the characteristics of N-doped TiO2 the homogenous dispersion of nitrogen molecules, small particle sizes, and energy-gap reduction, prompting a 6% increase in antibiotic degradation compared with Com. TiO2. In the RSM analysis, the ideal conditions were found to be a pH of 5, H2O2 conc. of 400 mg/L, catalyst conc. of 50 mg, and antibiotics conc. of 25 mg/L for an antibiotics reduction rate of 89.31% (AMOX/Com. TiO2/Solar), 90.2 (CFX/Com. TiO2/Solar), 95.8% (AMOX/N-TiO2/Solar) and 97.3% (CFX/N-TiO2/Solar). Experimental results were in good agreement with predictions because the predicted R-2 matched well with the adjusted R-2.

TI Integrated Plant Nutrient Systems Improve Rice Yields without Affecting

AB Efficient management of fertilizers and irrigation could mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase crop yields. Field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of an integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) and water regime-alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and continuous flooding (CF)-on GHG emissions and rice yield. Fertilizer treatments included control (no N), prilled urea (PU), urea deep placement (UDP), and IPNS (50% N from poultry litter and 50% N from PU). Gas sampling and analysis were performed using a closed-chamber technique and gas chromatography. IPNS produced significantly (p < 0.05) higher seasonal total methane (CH4) emissions (9-15%) compared to the UDP treatment, but the emissions with IPNS were similar to those of PU. IPNS had an interaction effect with the water regime on nitrogen oxide (N2O) emissions. IPNS produced more emissions than PU under AWD, but their emissions were similar under CF irrigation. IPNS produced a significantly higher total global warming potential (GWP) than UDP but a GWP similar to the PU treatment in both Aus (pre-monsoon) and Aman (wet) seasons. AWD irrigation reduced the total GWP by 8% over CF without yield reductions. IPNS significantly increased rice yields compared to broadcast PU but yields were similar to those of UDP. These findings suggest that both IPNS and UDP could be effective in increasing crop yields without increasing GHG emissions.

TI Using Ex Situ and In Situ HERFD-XANES to Reveal the Superior Oxidation
   and Reduction Cycling of Ceria Nanocubes Dispersed in Silica Aerogel
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The oxygen storage capacity of ceria-based catalytic materials is influenced by their size, morphology, and surface structure, which can be tuned using surfactant-mediated synthesis. In particular, the cuboidal morphology exposes the most reactive surfaces; however, when the capping agent is removed, the nanocubes can agglomerate and limit the available reactive surface. Here, we study ceria nanocubes, lanthanum-doped ceria nanocubes, and ceria nanocubes embedded inside a highly porous silica aerogel by high-energy resolution fluorescence detection-X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy at the Ce L-3 edge. In situ measurements showed an increased reversibility of redox cycles in ceria nanocubes when embedded in the aerogel, demonstrating enhanced reactivity due to the retention of reactive surfaces. These aerogel nanocomposites show greater improvement in the redox capacity and increased thermal stability of this catalytic material compared to the surfactant-capped nanocubes. Ex situ measurements were also performed to study the effect of lanthanum doping on the cerium oxidation state in the nanocubes, indicating a higher proportion of Ce4+ compared to that of the undoped ceria nanocubes.

TI A facile and rapid route to synthesize
   CuOx/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalysts
   with high performance for CO preferential oxidation (CO-PROX)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB CuO(10)-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-UGC-300 (CuO-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 prepared by urea grind combustion method, with 10 wt.% CuO loading and calcined at 300 degrees C) and CuO(10)-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-IWI-300 (prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method) catalysts were tested for CO-PROX. It was noticed that both the CO conversion and the O-2 selectivity of CuO(10)-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-UGC-300 are higher than those of CuO(10)-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-IWI-300. The high performance catalytic activities of CuO(10)-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-UGC-300 have been attributed to the synergistic effects of highly dispersed Cu species together with the stronger interaction between CuO and the support. The effect of the CuO content and calcination temperature on the catalytic activity of the CuO-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalysts were investigated in detail. The catalyst with 10 wt.% CuO loading and calcined at 300 degrees C exhibited the highest catalytic activity. CuO(10)-Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-UGC-300 catalyst exhibited excellent adaptability of space velocity from 12,000 h(-1) to 36,000 h(-1) and with good tolerance towards CO2 and H2O.

TI Novel iron carbide based catalysts for biomass valorisation
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The present contribution explores alternative catalysts for a more practical biomass conversion and valorisation, in particular, iron carbide (with and without the presence of metallic iron) and iron manganese carbide-based nanocomposites were tested for the first time as catalysts toward the sustainable production of vanillin. The catalysts are crystalline, well-defined in composition, have a remarkable high relative surface area (233 m(2)/g for iron carbide and 202 m(2)/g for iron-manganese carbide) and were prepared in a greener way, i.e. using cellulose as carbon source. All tested catalysts have high activity and selectivity both in the oxidation of isoeugenol and vanillyl alcohol, two biomass-derived feedstock, into vanillin. Interestingly, it was observed that although the incorporation of manganese in the iron carbide structure does not improve the catalytic activity compared to the pure iron carbide, it has an effect on the material stability and selectivity towards vanillin, suggesting that ternary systems might allow controllable oxidation reactions.

TI From PET Bottles Waste to N-Doped Graphene as Sustainable
   Electrocatalyst Support for Direct Liquid Fuel Cells
SO CATALYSTS
AB Direct liquid fuel cells represent one of the most rapidly emerging energy conversion devices. The main challenge in developing fuel cell devices is finding low-cost and highly active catalysts. In this work, PET bottle waste was transformed into nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) as valuable catalyst support. NG was prepared by a one-pot thermal decomposition process of mineral water waste bottles with urea at 800 degrees C. Then, NG/Pt electrocatalysts with Pt loadings as low as 0.9 wt.% and 1.8 wt.% were prepared via a simple reduction method in aqueous solution at room temperature. The physical and electrochemical properties of the NG/Pt electrocatalysts are characterized and evaluated for application in direct borohydride peroxide fuel cells (DBPFCs). The results show that NG/Pt catalysts display catalytic activity for borohydride oxidation reaction, particularly the NG/Pt_1, with a number of exchanged electrons of 2.7. Using NG/Pt composite in fuel cells is anticipated to lower prices and boost the usage of electrochemical energy devices. A DBPFC fuel cell using NG/Pt_1 catalyst (1.8 wt.% Pt) in the anode achieved a power density of 75 mW cm(-2) at 45 degrees C. The exceptional performance and economic viability become even more evident when expressed as mass-specific power density, reaching a value as high as 15.8 W mg(Pt)(-1).

TI Synthesis and characterization of cellulose nanofibers from waste paper
   and their utilization in wood adhesion
SO POLYMER COMPOSITES
AB Nanocellulose extraction from lignocellulosic materials is a highly chemical and energy-intensive process as it requires the removal of lignin and hemicellulose. Writing paper is one of the processed materials that could be used as a raw material for the extraction of nanocellulose. In this work, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were synthesized from paper waste using TEMPO-oxidation followed by high-shear microfluidization. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirmed the diameter of fibers in the nano-range and a consistent zeta potential confirmed the stability of CNF suspension in water over a long time frame. Characterization of the CNFs using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated the presence of a carbonyl group due to the oxidation process. Thermogravimetric analysis and x-ray diffraction revealed lower thermal stability and reduction in the crystallinity index of CNFs, as compared to pulp fibers. The obtained CNFs were used successfully as the sole binding agent in the preparation of fiberboards and also utilized as a reinforcing agent for polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesive in the preparation of laminated veneer lumber (LVLs). The addition of CNFs in PVAc improved the glue shear strength indicating superior bonding characteristics and also increased the water resistance of the LVLs.
   Highlights
   This work focused on cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) extraction from waste paper
   Obtained CNFs form stable water suspension and have a diameter of less than 15 nm
   Thermal stability and crystallinity index reduced after conversion to nanofibers
   CNFs form a complex network and act as a sole binder to make fiberboards
   CNFs were utilized as a reinforcing agent for PVAc in preparation of LVLs

TI Selective Depolymerization of Lignin Towards Isolated Phenolic Acids
   Under Mild Conditions
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB The selective transformation of lignin to value-added biochemicals (e. g., phenolic acids) in high yields is incredibly challenging due to its structural complexity and many possible reaction pathways. Phenolic acids (PA) are key building blocks for various aromatic polymers, but the isolation of PAs from lignin is below 5 wt.% and requires harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we demonstrate an effective route to selectively convert lignin extracted from sweet sorghum and poplar into isolated PA in a high yield (up to 20 wt.% of lignin) using a low-cost graphene oxide-urea hydrogen peroxide (GO-UHP) catalyst under mild conditions (<120 & DEG;C). The lignin conversion yield is up to 95 %, and the remaining low molecular weight organic oils are ready for aviation fuel production to complete lignin utilization. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that pre-acetylation allows the selective depolymerization of lignin to aromatic aldehydes with a decent yield by GO through the C & alpha; activation of & beta;-O-4 cleavage. A urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP) oxidative process is followed to transform aldehydes in the depolymerized product to PAs by avoiding the undesired Dakin side reaction due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the acetyl group. This study opens a new way to selectively cleave lignin side chains to isolated biochemicals under mild conditions.

TI Electrochemical degradation of tetracycline in artificial urine medium
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB The electrochemical degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TeC) was comparatively investigated in artificial urine and chloride -containing media using a one-compartment filter-press flow cell composed of a Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 dimensionally stable anode. The effect of the current density (1040 mA cm(-2)) on the removal levels attained for TeC and total organic carbon (TOC) (in both media), as well as for urea and creatinine in artificial urine medium, was assessed. The TeC removal rate in the artificial urine medium was much lower than in chloride -containing medium, probably due to the higher consumption of the electrogenerated active chlorine species by the urea and creatinine in the artificial urine medium, Moreover, the obtained removal levels for the urea and creatinine were negligible at current densities lower than 30 mA cm(-2), As TOC abatement was also very small, it is possible that TeC oxidation leads to intermediate compounds. Thus, if current densities less than 20 mA cm 2 are applied. TeC can be selectively removed.

TI Recurrent ACADVL molecular findings in individuals with a
   positive newborn screen for very long chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase
   (VLCAD) deficiency in the United States
SO MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM
AB Very long chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of fatty acid oxidation detected by newborn screening (NBS). Follow-up molecular analyses are often required to clarify VLCADD-suggestive NBS results, but to date the outcome of these studies are not well described for the general screen-positive population. In the following study, we report the molecular findings for 693 unrelated patients that sequentially received Sanger sequence analysis of ACADVL as a result of a positive NBS for VLCADD. Highlighting the variable molecular underpinnings of this disorder, we identified 94 different pathogenic ACADVL variants (40 novel), as well as 134 variants of unknown clinical significance (VUSs). Evidence for the pathogenicity of a subset of recurrent VUSs was provided using multiple in silico analyses. Surprisingly, the most frequent finding in our cohort was carrier status, 57% all individuals had a single pathogenic variant or VUS. This result was further supported by follow-up array and/or acylcamitine analysis that failed to provide evidence of a second pathogenic allele. Notably, exon-targeted array analysis of 131 individuals screen positive for VLCADD failed to identify copy number changes in ACADVL thus suggesting this test has a low yield in the setting of NBS follow-up. While no genotype was common, the c.848T>C (p.V283A) pathogenic variant was clearly the most frequent; at least one copy was found in similar to 10% of all individuals with a positive NBS. Clinical and biochemical data for seven unrelated patients homozygous for the p.V283A allele suggests that it results in a mild phenotype that responds well to standard treatment, but hypoglycemia can occur. Collectively, our data illustrate the molecular heterogeneity of VLCADD and provide novel insight into the outcomes of NBS for this disorder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Pentlandite Compound-Anchored CuSCN as a Stable Electrocatalyst in
   Highly Alkaline Solutions
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) is an unexplored material for water-splitting reactions, and it is a well-known photocathode in dye-sensitized solar cells. For the first time, the electrochemical properties of CuSCN were investigated and used in overall water-splitting reactions. It is observed that when a negative potential is applied to CuSCN, it readily gets electrons from the circuit and gives them to the dissociated hydrogen radical (H+), which in turn facilitates more hydrogen adsorption sites (H-ad) and evolves hydrogen gas. Despite this advantage, chalcogenide materials (CuSCN) are not stable in alkaline solutions (pH = 14), where the surface gets easily oxidized in the KOH electrolyte by forming an S=O bond. Therefore, to prevent oxidation and material dissolution, we passivated the CuSCN surface with FeCo. Interestingly, the deposition of FeCo on CuSCN forms a pentlandite compound anchoring CuSCN, which suppresses the oxidation of the CuSCN surface in KOH solution by interatomic coupling of crystal systems and avoids direct contact of CuSCN with the electrolyte. Also, the inductively coupled plasma results show that the material dissolution concentration is greatly reduced from 2.67:26 to 0.37:3.4 (Cu:S) for FeCo-passivated CuSCN surfaces. The full cell constructed using CuSCN30 parallel to FeCo/CuSCN30 as the cathode and the anode exhibits 1.70 V at 50 mA/cm(2) and tremendous robustness at a high current density of 200 mA/cm(2) for 50 h.

TI Ni―Co―O―S Derived Catalysts on Hierarchical N-doped Carbon Supports with
   Strong Interfacial Interactions for Improved Hybrid Water Splitting
   Performance
SO SMALL
AB Simultaneously improving electrochemical activity and stability is a long-term goal for water splitting. Herein, hierarchical N-doped carbon nanotubes on carbon nanowires derived from PPy are grown on carbon cloth, serving as a support for NiCo oxides/sulfides. The hierarchical electrodes annealed in N-2 or H-2/N-2 display improved intrinsic activity and stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and glucose oxidation reaction. Compared with Pt/C||Ir/C in alkaline media, the glucose electrolysis assembled with electrodes exhibits a cell voltage of 1.38 V at 10 mA cm(-2), durability for >12 h at 50 mA cm(-2), and resistance to glucose/gluconic acid poisoning. In addition, electrocatalysts can also be applied in ethanol oxidation reactions. Systematic characterizations reveal the strong interactions between NiCo and N-doped carbon support-induced partial charge transfer at the interface and regulate the local electronic structure of active sites. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect between N-doped carbon supports, metallic NiCo, and NiCo oxides/sulfides optimize the adsorption energy of H2O and the H* free energy for HER. The energy barrier of the dehydrogenation of glucose effectively decreased. This work will attract attention to the role of metal-support interactions in enhancing the intrinsic activity and stability of electrocatalysts.

SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB The surface of the mesoporous silica SBA-15 (SBA) was modified by a tetra-urea (TU) ligand (SBA@TU), and the palladium ions were anchored within the multidentate pore channels (SBA@TU@Pd(II)) and re-duced by NaBH4 (SBA@TU@Pd(0)). Then, the nano-structure reduced catalyst was characterized by FT-IR, EDX, elemental mapping analysis, XRD, SEM, TEM, TGA/DTA/DCS, and BET analysis. After that, the catalytic activity of the SBA@TU @Pd(0) catalyst was successfully studied in the Mizoroki-Heck and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions under mild reaction conditions for preparation of 1(a-l) and 2(a-i), respectively in short reaction times and high yields. Also, the Mizoroki-Heck and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling re-actions were performed by the non-reduced nano-catalyst (SBA@TU@Pd(II)) under similar reaction con-ditions. The reaction yields were the same for both catalysts, but the reaction time was different which was shorter (30 min) for SBA@TU@Pd(0), while for SBA@TU@Pd(II) the reaction times were increased to about 80 and 70 min, respectively.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Occurrence, effects, detection, and photodegradation of triclosan and
   triclocarban in the environment: a review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Antibacterial agents like triclosan (TCS, 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) and triclocarban (TCC, 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea are commonly found in everyday household and personal care products. Both compounds are widely distributed in the environment, acting as potential sources of contamination to ecological safety and human health problems such as algal growth-inhibiting effects; bioaccumulation in algae; endocrine-disrupting effects; development of microbial resistance, and formation of toxic degradable products. Environmentalists are increasingly concerned about the emergence of these micro-organic pollutants in the environment. This review paper focuses on the current state of knowledge, occurrence, effects, detection, and removal techniques for triclosan and triclocarban in the environment. People are exposed to these antibacterial agents when transported from wastewater treatment plants, air, dust, household products, and personal care products. These exposures lead to bioaccumulation in human tissue and biomagnification in the food chain. Surveys have revealed that TCC and TCS under sunlight formed toxic and persistent constituents like chlorinated phenols, methyl triclosan (MTCS), and biphenyl ethers. Different analytical approaches have been used to detect and degrade these compounds to ensure their complete removal in the environment but are found inadequate to effectively eliminate TCS and TCC. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have shown to be promising in successfully breaking down TCS and TCC, considering material and energy consumption and emission of carbon (IV) oxide. Therefore, robust strategies such as electrochemical and nanomaterial methods should be implemented to determine and sequester TCS and TCC in the environment. Furthermore, regulatory bodies and environmental experts should be concerned about the fate and nanocatalyst photodegradation of triclosan and triclocarban in the environment.

TI Biochar-enriched soil mitigated N2O and NO emissions
   similarly as fresh biochar for wheat production
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Biochar amendment has been recommended as a potential strategy to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions for wheat production, but its mechanism and effective duration are not well understood. The 1-octyne and 2-pheny l-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) in combination with potassium chlorate were used to evaluate the relative contribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) to potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) and N2O and NO production as affected by biochar. Acidic and alkaline soils were collected during wheat-growing season, and four treatments were installed in each soil type: CK, urea alone; BE, biochar-enriched soil for 2-6 years; FB, fresh biochar added to CK; and AB, aged biochar added to CK. The results showed that octyne and PTIO efficiently assessed AOB and AOA activities in soil incubation. The AOB-driven PAO in acidic soil was largely enhanced by increased soil pH in BE and FB treatments, whereas AOA-driven PAO was not. And the contribution of AOB to PAO exceeded 80% in alkaline soil. The N2O and NO production were positively correlated with PAO in both soils. BE treatment decreased the direct N2O and NO production in alkaline soil, while both BE and FB treatments decreased the N2O and NO yields in acidic soil, indicating that biochar mitigated soil N2O and NO emissions for wheat production. The lack of differences between AB and CK treatments indicated that aged biochar lost its initial effects on PAO, while the biocharenriched soil amended with biochar years earlier still functioned similarly as fresh biochar.

   silicalite molecular sieve
SO CATALYSIS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The investigation of the active centers in titanium zeolite was conducted by a probe reaction, the oxidation of trimethylphosphine. The different sites of TS-1 zeolite can be clearly distinguished through P-31 solid-state MAS NMR spectra of adsorbed trimethylphosphine. The results showed that only the trimethylphosphine bound to the coordinate-unsaturated framework Ti sites and the distorted tetrahedral Ti sites ofTS-1 zeolite could be easily oxidized by urea hydrogen peroxide. Diffuse Reflectance UV-Vis and Si-29 MAS NMR spectra further confirmed that the titanium peroxide species (TiOOH), which is formed through the solid-solid interaction between urea-H2O2 and TS-1 zeolite, could be catalytic active centers during the oxidation of trimethylphosphine.

TI In situ preparation of highly graphitized N-doped biochar geopolymer
   composites for efficient catalytic degradation of tetracycline in water
   by H2O2
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) hold great prospects for the treatment of antibiotic wastewater. N-doped biochar (NB) has received increasing attention as a catalyst for AOPs because of its green nature, abundant biomass resources, and low cost. However, NB catalysts are complicated to prepare and difficult to recover, limiting their practical application. In this study, an N-doped biochar geopolymer composite (NBGC) was syn-thesized via in situ doping, simultaneous carbonization, and activation (ISCA) of lignin and urea in the porous geopolymer flake, without additional activators. The ISCA process used a low-cost geopolymer flake that not only served as a carrier to immobilize NB and facilitate the recovery, but also applied its inherent strong alkalinity to activate NB. The composite catalyst obtained at 600 degrees C (NBGC-600) exhibited excellent activity in activating H2O2 to degrade tetracycline (similar to 100%, 50 mg/L). The EPR results indicated that NBGC-600 had a strong ability to activate and decompose H2O2 to center dot OH, which could be attributed to its rich persistent radicals, graphitized N and C--O groups, as well as the high degree of graphitization of biochar. The degradation pathway and in-termediates of tetracycline in the NBGC-600-H2O2 system were also discussed according to the HPLC-MS results. Moreover, NBGC-600 had excellent reusability and showed great potential for continuous treatment of tetra-cycline in water. This work paves a new way for the synthesis of cost-effective N-doped biochar composite catalysts for AOPs.

TI Synthesis, characterization, and catalytic application of Cr and Mn
   Schiff base complexes immobilized on modified nanoporous MCM-41
SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB Immobilization of chromium and manganese Schiff base complexes by postgrafting of ligand then metal salts on the walls of mesoporous MCM-41 functionalized with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane is described. Characterization of the resulting heterogeneous catalysts by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) techniques indicated successful grafting of these two complexes inside the nanochannels of MCM-41. The complexes were found to be efficient, selective catalysts for oxidation of various sulfides to sulfoxides and oxidative coupling of thiols to corresponding disulfides using H2O2 as oxidant at room temperature. The recycling results of these heterogeneous catalysts showed good recyclability without significant loss of activity or selectivity in successive runs, indicating that the Cr and Mn Schiff base complexes supported on nanoporous MCM-41 remained intact and the coordination environments were not altered during the reaction.

TI Salinity-induced concomitant increases in soil ammonia volatilization
   and nitrous oxide emission
SO GEODERMA
AB Environmental concerns about the release of reactive nitrogen (N) from intensively fertilized farmland are growing, especially regarding gaseous N losses in the form of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O). While saline soils are widely distributed and gradually expanding worldwide, the effect of soil salinity on soil NH3 and N2O emissions is poorly understood. To assess the effect of soil salinity levels on NH3 volatilization and N2O emissions, a field experiment was conducted with three soil salinity levels (SO = non-saline, S1 = 1.0 dS m (-1) and S2 = 5.0 dS m(-1)) and two N fertilizer types (urea and ammonium sulphate). Compared to the non-saline soil, S1 and S2 salinity levels both led to significant increases in cumulative NH3 volatilization losses by 40.0%-65.2% and 89.0%-92.2%, respectively (p < 0.05). Following the application of either urea and ammonium sulphate, N2O emissions at the 51 salinity level were significantly greater than those at both S0 and S2 salinity levels (p < 0.05). The correlation showed that the NH3 flux was an exponential function with respect to soil ammonium (NH4+ -N) concentration (R-2 = 0.766, p < 0.05), and the N2O flux displayed a linear relationship with soil nitrite (NO2- -N) concentration (R-2 = 0.816, p < 0.05) which was accumulated to a much greater degree under the S1 salinity level. Saline soil's promotion of NH3 volatilization was a result from urea hydrolysis, nitrification and soil NH4+ -N adsorption capacity being suppressed under elevated soil salinity. Increased N2O emissions were ascribed to the accumulation of soil NO2-N caused by the imbalance of salinity's inhibition on nitrite oxidation and ammonia oxidation. This study indicates that saline soils have a considerable potential to simultaneously increase NH3 and N2O emissions, so mitigation options should be explored when cultivating saline soils.

TI N-doped biochar from sewage sludge for catalytic peroxydisulfate
   activation toward sulfadiazine: Efficiency, mechanism, and stability
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Sewage sludge-derived biochar (SBC) could remove organic contaminants in environment and reuse the sludge effectively. In this study, urea-doped SBC (NSBC) was prepared, characterized, and applied as heterogeneous catalytics to peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. Sulfadiazine (SD), a widely used antibiotic, was used as a model pollutant to evaluate the efficiency and mechanism of this system. The degradation rate of SD increased to 100% after 4 h when 1 g/L of NSBC was added to the system with a SD concentration of 20 mg/L. In this study, it was confirmed that there were two important pathways in the degradation of SD by NSBC/PDS system: the free radical on the surface of NSBC and the nonradical (O-1(2)) in the solution. The doping of N atoms makes neighboring C atoms positively charged, thereby making the direct transfer of electrons with S2O82- and the generation of O-1(2) via nonradical pathway easy. In addition, the C=O functional group formed during the pyrolysis of NSBC can produce O-1(2) in a similar way. A total of 22 SD degradation products were identified, and 4 possible pathways were proposed. This study provide supplement for the degradation mechanism of organic compounds by carbonbased materials.

TI Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotube-Supported Pd Catalyst for Improved
   Electrocatalytic Performance toward Ethanol Electrooxidation
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB In this study, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) was applied for surface functionalization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the presence of glucose and urea. The HTC process allowed the deposition of thin nitrogen-doped carbon layers on the surface of the CNTs. By controlling the ratio of glucose to urea, nitrogen contents of up to 1.7 wt% were achieved. The nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube-supported Pd catalysts exhibited superior electrochemical activity for ethanol oxidation relative to the pristine CNTs. Importantly, a 1.5-fold increase in the specific activity was observed for the Pd/HTC-N1.67% CNTs relative to the catalyst without nitrogen doping (Pd/HTC-CNTs). Further experiments indicated that the introduction of nitrogen species on the surface of the CNTs improved the Pd(0) loading and increased the binding energy.

TI Identification of serum metabolites associated with aristolochic acid
   nephropathy severity and insights into the underlying mechanism
SO TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
AB Aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) is a rapidly progressive kidney disease caused by medical or environmental exposure to aristolochic acids (AAs). This study aimed to identify serum metabolites associated with the severity of acute AAN and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with vehicle and 3 doses of aristolochic acid I (AAI) (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/d) for 5 days by intraperitoneal injection. The results showed that AAI dose-dependently increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels and renal pathological damage. Non-targeted metabolomics revealed that differences in serum metabolite profiles from controls increased with increasing AAI doses. Compared with the control group, 56 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) that could be affected by all 3 doses of AAI were obtained. We further identified 13 DEMs whose abundance significantly correlated with Scr and BUN levels and had good predictive values for diagnosing AAI exposure. Among the 13 DEMs, lipids and lipid-like molecules constituted the majority. Western blotting found that AAI suppressed renal fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-related enzymes expression. In conclusion, these findings provided evidence for developing biomarkers for monitoring AAs exposure and AAN diagnosis and indicated activation of FAO as a potential direction for the treatment of AAN.

TI Optimum N rate for grain yield coincides with minimum greenhouse gas
   intensity in flooded rice fields
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Excessive application of N fertilizer to rice results in water and atmospheric pollution including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, N fertilizer management needs to be optimized taking into account grain yield, global warming potential (GWP, Mg CO2 eq. ha(-1)) and GHG intensity (GHGI, kg CO2 eq. kg(-1) grain). However, the tradeoffs between the effects of N rate on rice grain yield, GWP and GHGI have not been adequately evaluated. Therefore, field experiments to determine the effect of N rate (as urea) on yield, GWP and GHGI were conducted in a typical flooded, transplanted rice paddy in a temperate environment. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission rates were determined throughout the entire year (both during growing and fallow seasons) over two years. Rice grain yield showed a quadratic response to N rate, and the maximum yield (6.7-6.8 t ha(-1)) was achieved at 112-119 kg N ha(-1), 50% higher than the yield of the control (0 kg N ha(-1)). Increasing N rate increased the seasonal N2O flux by 4.56-7.11 g N2O kg(-1) N, but N2O flux contributed less than 7% of the total GWP. The GWP was mainly determined by the CH4 flux, which showed a relatively flat quadratic response to N rate, peaking at 124-138 kg N ha(-1). Thus, GWP also showed a quadratic response to N rate, peaking at 122-130 kg N ha(-1). The GHGI decreased as N rate increased and was the lowest (1.10-1.28 kg CO2-eq. kg(-1 )grain yield) at 104-112 kg N ha(-1), approximately 20% lower than GHGI in the 0 N treatment. In conclusion, the N rate for maximum yield was similar to the N rate for minimum GHGI, mainly because of the small effect of N rate on CH4 emissions and the low magnitude of N2O emissions. Thus, GHGI was largely driven by grain yield, so the N rate for maximum grain yield was similar to the N rate for maximum GHGI. Proper N fertilization is essential in rice farming systems to increase crop productivity and reduce the global warming impact (GWP and GHGI).

TI Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) three-dimensional
   electrode electrochemically activates persulfate for the degradation of
   tetracycline
SO CARBON LETTERS
AB The presence of tetracycline (TC) has been detected in the human living environment, and its complex structure makes it difficult to degrade. The green and efficient utilization of electroactivated persulfate advanced oxidation technology for the degradation of tetracycline remains a challenge. In this study, N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) was prepared using a hydrothermal treatment method with urea as the nitrogen source. Four different mass ratios of graphene oxide (GO) to urea were synthesized, and the optimal mass ratio was determined through degradation experiments of tetracycline. The N-rGO/EC/PMS three-dimensional electrocatalytic system was constructed, and the influence of the experimental data on TC degradation, such as initial pH, PMS dosage and voltage, was determined. Characterization analysis using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and other methods was conducted. The efficient catalytic ability of N-rGO was demonstrated through the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and consumption of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The superiority of the three-dimensional (3D) electrochemical advanced oxidation process was proposed by combining different systems. Furthermore, the presence of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-.), persulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-), and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was identified using electron spin resonance (ESR) technology. The utilization of N-rGO as a three-dimensional electrode, coupled with the advantages of PMS activation and electrochemical oxidation processes, is a promising method for treating organic pollutants in wastewater.

TI Degradation of gaseous nitriding of steel by lubricant contamination
   Effect of in-situ pre-treatments
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The present work focuses on the industrial inhibition of gaseous nitrided parts and on the industrial in-situ pretreatment that can be used to avoid these inhibitions. The first objective is to obtain a repeatable defective nitriding process on carbon iron-based alloys, while the second is to determine the ability of determined in-situ pre treatments to counter the previously mastered inhibition. Machining oil is used in order to obtain an industrially consistent inhibition. Its presence before chemical treatment strongly inhibits the adsorption of nitrogen atoms at the other surface, leading to heterogeneous nitriding properties of the treated samples. EDS analysis of oil residues indicates the presence of several elements, such as sulphur and carbon. As several studies already focused on the influence of sulphur on nitriding properties, experimentations on the influence of carbon are detailed. Contamination by carbon deposit leads to similar inhibition as in the case of a machining oil contamination. Literature analyses lead to the determination of three in-situ pre-treatments, namely urea (CH4N2O), pre-oxidation and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), to counter the detrimental effects such contaminations. Although all the processes enable to suppress the nitriding inhibition due to the presence of machining oil, ammonium chloride indicates the best capability to activate the adsorption of nitrogen of machining oil contaminated" surfaces.

TI Enhanced Interactions between Gold and MnO2 Nanowires for
   Water Oxidation: A Comparison of Different Chemical and Physical
   Preparation Methods
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been considered as the bottleneck step in water electrolysis to simultaneously produce hydrogen and oxygen. The earth abundant first-row metal oxides such as manganese oxide have been found very active after anchoring nanoparticular noble metals such as Au, Pd and Pt onto its surface. Recent reports have demonstrated that Au can increase the turnover frequency (TOF) of MnOx more than 10 times for the OER due to the unique local interaction between Au and MnOx. Here, we conducted a detailed comparative study of different preparation methods on the OER activity of Au/MnO2 nanocomposites, including physical sputtering (PS), deposition precipitation with urea (DPU), DP with NaOH (DPN) and deposition reduction (DR) with NaBH4. Through carefully controlling the preparation conditions, we find chemical preparation methods (i.e., DPU and DPN) can achieve uniform growth of monodispersed Au nanoparticles on MnO2 nanowires (Au/MnO2) same as sputtering; moreover, the as-prepared Au-MnO2 by DPU and DPN shows stronger interaction than that by sputtering, thereby achieving higher OER performance. Delicate chemical valence change and conductivity improvement induced by such interaction are further quantified by conventional XPS, resistivity and impedance measurements.

TI ADSORPTION AS ALTERNATIVE PROCESS IN THE PRELIMINARY PRODUCTION OF
   AUTOMOTIVE ADDITIVE
SO CHEMICAL INDUSTRY & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING QUARTERLY
AB Nitrogenous contaminants in the diesel fraction are converted to NOx compounds in an automotive combustion chamber. Afterwards, they are reduced to nitrogen by catalytic reduction/oxidation reactions in presence of ammonia derived from a 32.5 wt.% urea solution. This process is named selective catalytic reduction (SCR). In Brazil, the urea solution for SCR is ARLA 32 and must comply with the limit content of 0.3 wt.% of biuret. However, the commercial Brazilian urea solution has an average biuret content of 0.5 wt.%. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the biuret content in urea solution to be used as ARLA 32, and adsorption is a low energy option. The objective of this study was to evaluate commercial adsorbents for removing biuret from solution of commercial urea to adjust it to the specification of ARLA 32. Two activated coals and one ion exchange resin were tested in adsorption assays, with best performances of both coals.

TI Unveiling the effect of growth time on bifunctional layered hydroxide
   electrodes for high-performance energy storage and green energy
   conversion
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Tailoring the properties of transition metal-based layered double hydroxides is inevitable for high-performance energy storage and efficient urea-electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) for effectively harnessing energy from urea-rich wastewater. Herein, the effect of growth time on the bi-functional properties of NiCo layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co LDH) is unveiled. Under the optimum growth time, the NiCo LDH electrode shows an excellent specific capacity of 210.5 mA h g-1 at 2.5 mA cm-2, outperforming many binder-free electrodes reported previously. Further, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated, exhibiting exceptional energy storage capabilities in terms of a specific capacitance of 77.7 F g-1, energy density of 22.6 W h kg-1, and excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 86.8%. The ASC is encapsulated with a 3D-printed casing to power miniature electronics. The as-synthesized electrode was explored as an efficient electrocatalyst for the UOR. The lower onset potential with optimized catalytic behavior paves the way for green energy harvesting from urea-rich water through efficient UOR. The controlled growth morphology and reaction time influence the UOR and energy storage efficiency of the bimetallic LDH. This study provides meaningful insights into the tailor-made performance enhancement of bi-functional electrodes for energy storage and efficient energy conversion.

TI Effect of the progressive addition of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   tetrafluoroborate as ionic liquid solvent for designing potassium ion
   conducting polymer gel electrolyte
SO IONICS
AB Urea electrolysis has prospects for urea-containing wastewater purification and hydrogen (H-2) production, but the shortage of cost-effective catalysts restricts its development. In this work, the tomentum-like FeNi3-MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets array self-supported on nickel foam (NF) as bifunctional catalyst is prepared by facile hydrothermal and annealing method. Only 1.29 V and -50.8 mV is required to obtain +/- 10 mA cm(-2) for urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction (UOR and HER), respectively, showing great bifunctional catalytic activity. For overall urea electrolysis, it only needs 1.37 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and can last at 100 mA cm(-2) for 70 h without obvious activity attenuation, showing outstanding durability. Coupling interface constructions of FeNi3-MoO2 heterostructures, novel morphology with a mesoporous and self-supporting structure could be the reason for this good performance. This work thus proposes a promising catalyst for boosting UOR and HER to realize efficient overall urea electrolysis.

TI Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet/carbon nanotube hybrids as
   metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts for water oxidation and oxygen
   reduction
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The development of metal-free catalysts for efficient catalysis of both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is extremely desirable in energy technologies. Herein, nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrids have been synthesized by the pyrolysis of glucose, urea and CNTs. Impressively, in 0.1 M KOH, the resulting hybrids afford remarkable OER activities with a low onset potential (1.50 V vs. RHE) and an exceptional over-potential (only 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the same hybrids show comparable catalytic performance but better durability compared to the benchmark Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst for ORR. The achieved ultrahigh catalytic performance of the hybrids originates from their large specific surface area (594.1 m(2) g(-1)), high content percentage of N doping (8.5 wt%), and mesoporous structure, which leads to fully exposed active sites, improved mass/electron transport capability, easy adsorption/release of oxygen gas bubbles, and high structural stability. This work also provides a novel concept for fabricating heteroatom doped porous carbonaceous materials with integrated and improved catalytic performance for advanced applications.

TI Effective Fuel Cell Electrocatalyst with Ultralow Pd Loading on
   Ni-N-Doped Graphene from Upcycled Water Bottle Waste
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Environmental pollution due to the excessive consumption of fossil fuels for energy production is a critical global issue. Fuel cells convert chemical energy directly into electricity in a clean and silent electrochemical process, but face challenges related to hydrogen storage, handling, and transportation. The direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC), utilizing sodium borohydride as a liquid fuel, is a promising alternative to overcome such issues but requires the design of cost-effective nanostructured electrocatalysts. In this study, we synthesized nitrogen-doped graphene anchoring Ni nanoparticles (Ni@NG) by thermal degradation of polyethylene terephthalate bottle waste with urea and metallic Ni, and evaluated it as a sustainable carbon support. Electrocatalysts were prepared by incorporating ultralow amounts (0.09 to 0.27 wt.%) of Pd into the Ni@NG support. The resulting PdNi@NG electrocatalysts were characterized using ICP-OES, XPS, TEM, N2-sorption analysis, XRD, and Raman and FTIR spectroscopy. Voltammetry assessed the materials' electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction and borohydride oxidation reactions in alkaline media, corresponding to the anodic and cathodic reactions in DBFCs. The electrocatalyst with 0.27 wt.% Pd loading (PdNi_15@NG) exhibited the best performance for both reactions. Consequently, it was employed as an anodic and cathodic material in a lab-scale DBFC, achieving a specific power of 3.46 kW gPd-1.

TI NO, NO2 and N2O emissions over a SCR using DOC and
   DPF systems with Pt reduction
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A Pt-reduced diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and diesel particulate filter (DPF) combination was used to evaluate the influences of N reduction on the oxidation performance in a nonroad diesel engine. For the Pt-reduced combination, a mass fraction of 1.5% N in the DOC was lower than a DOC of a non-reduction combination. These DOCs were composed of N only. The DPF in the Pt-reduced combination was composed of N and Pd with a 2:1 ratio, i.e., Pd was substituted for N. Whereas the DPF in the non-reduction combination was N only. The oxidation performance in the DOC and DPF systems of the Pt-reduced combination was relatively consistent with the non-reduction combination. The behavior of the undesirable oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) occurred in both combinations. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system was also installed for NO and NO2 abatement, and NO and NO2 were evaluated based on the conversion efficiency. The fast SCR reaction, which involves both NO and NO2, was dominantly activated at the SCR inlet temperature of 380 degrees C because the NO2/NOx ratio is approximately 60%. The fast SCR reaction competed with the standard SCR reaction above 380 degrees C, and then the standard SCR reaction became the prevailing reaction as the temperatures increased. Nitrous oxide (N2O), which has 298 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide, was also investigated mainly over the SCR. N2O has increased dozens of times over the SCR, and a lower ratio of N2O emission after the SCR to the NOx at the SCR inlet was obtained in the Pt-reduced combination than in the nonreduction combination.

   Pt/Ce0.8La0.2O2-δ-CNT: The effect of
   Ce0.8La0.2O2-δ/CNT ratio
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Hybrid materials of (100-x)wt% Ce0.8La0.2O2-delta-x wt% CNT composition (x=0, 7.5, 20.5, 32.5, 44.1 and 100) were synthesized using the urea-assisted co-precipitation method and used as supports of 0.5 wt% Pt toward the low-temperature WGS (LT-WGS) reaction. The main focus of this work was to provide fundamental understanding of the effect of Ce0.8La0.2O2-delta/CNT ratio on the LT-WGS catalytic activity of such materials. It was found that the material containing 44.1 wt% CNT presented the best catalytic activity (kinetic rate and CO conversion), result that is correlated with the following parameters: (i) Pt-CO bond strength (TPD-CO), (ii) extent of dispersion of the Ce0.8La0.2O2-delta phase in the hybrid support system and, thus of the Pt phase; the larger dispersion of the Ce0.8La0.2O2-delta phase had a direct impact on its reducibility ability (labile oxygen species), (iii) concentration of surface Ce3+ species (XPS), indication for an increased concentration of oxygen vacant sites, (iv) Pt-H bond strength (H-2-TPD studies), and (v) concentration of active carbon-containing intermediates, "C-pool" formed around each Pt nanoparticle (SSITKA studies). WGS kinetic studies at 300 degrees C revealed that the reaction order with respect to CO was 0.17 and 0.13 for the catalysts containing 20.5 and 44.1 wt% CNT, respectively, while the reaction order with respect to H2O was 1.40 for the latter CNT loading. Oxidation of CNTs over the catalyst containing 44.1 wt% of CNTs occurred at temperatures larger than 400 degrees C, result of practical importance for the LT-WGS reaction. The proposed WGS reaction mechanism over the present catalytic materials is that of "redox" in parallel with the "associative with OH group regeneration" mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI Versatile Protein-Templated TiO2 Nanocomposite for Energy
   Storage and Catalytic Applications
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB A protein-templated titania nanocomposite (PT-TiO2) was successfully synthesized by a water-free mechanochemical approach. A biomass valorization strategy was developed by employing egg white from expired eggs to control the morphology and textural features of the prepared titania. A remarkable enhancement of the surface area was achieved, in comparison with the synthesis of the material in absence of the biomass-derived template. Several techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy-mapping and CNHS analysis, supported the presence of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur residues in the obtained composite. Catalytic performance of PT-TiO2 was explored in the oxidation of diphenyl sulfide, displaying promising results in terms of conversion, selectivity and stability. The effect of the oxidant agent was additionally investigated by using hydrogen peroxide, urea hydrogen peroxide, oxygen and t-butyl-hydroperoxide. On the other hand, PT-TiO2 nanocomposite was successfully proved as anodic material for lithium-ion batteries delivering a reversible capacity of 107 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C with an excellent Coulombic efficiency of 100% from the second cycle. In addition, the as-synthesized material showed significant capacity retention values of 76% among the 2nd cycle and 100th cycle. PT-TiO2 resulted to be a versatile material with potential catalytic and energy storage applications.

AB We investigated the influence of nitrogen doping on the electrocatalytic effect of TiO2 nanofibers by electrochemical methods. The electrocatalytic activities of nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanofibers (N-TiO2) produced using urea as the source of nitrogen and undoped Tiv nanofibers were compared. The results showed that the N-TiO2 nanofibers possessed high activity in electrocatalytic oxidation of hydroquinone in buffer solution. The N-TiO2 nanofibers exhibited excellent catalytic activity because nitrogen doping changed the morphology of the nanofibers. Thus, nitrogen doping is a promising approach to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanofibers in hydroquinone oxidation. (c) 2017 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of the Huangkui capsule (sic) on chronic kidney disease: a
   systematic review and Meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE
AB OBJECTIVE: To collect data and investigate the effects of Huangkui capsule ((sic), HKC) on chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and three Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and China Science and Technology Journal Database) were searched for articles published until October 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of HKCs used for treating CKD were reviewed. Data were organized and analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software.
   RESULTS: HKC significantly lowered the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level [mean difference (MD) = -2.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), -2.91 to -1.61], serum creatinine level (MD = -17.45; 95% CI, -22.29 to -12.60), and 24-h urine protein content (MD = -0.73; 95% CI, -1.00 to -0.46) and improved the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (MD = 10.69; 95% CI, 5.57 to 15.81) and serum albumin level (MD = 2.20; 95% CI, 0.49 to 3.90).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that HKC could lower the BUN level, serum creatinine level, and 24-h urine protein content. HKC also improved GFR and serum albumin levels. However, high-quality RCTs in other countries with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings. (c) 2023 JTCM. All rights reserved.

TI Enhanced catalytic combustion of complex VOCs over Ru/Ni-HAP catalyst:
   Insights into the synergic effects of Ru and Ni species
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In this study, Ni was severed as a promoter and impregnated on hydroxyapatite (HAP) to prepare a Ni-doped HAP support, and then Ru was highly dispersed onto the Ni-HAP through urea precipitation method. The synergistic effects between Ru and Ni caused a reduction in the particle size of Ru nanoparticles and an increased Ru4+/Ru0 ratios, which was primarily attributed to the strong interaction between the active components and functional groups of OH- and PO43-. Meanwhile, Ru/Ni-HAP possessed the highest amount of medium-strength acid sites and relatively low reduction temperatures, indicating the critical balance between acidity and redox capability. Ru/Ni-HAP exhibited superior activity with complete conversion of toluene at 280 degrees C and DCM at 400 degrees C, respectively, and such high activity can be maintained throughout the stability tests. Besides, optimal catalytic performance was observed under 600 ppm concentrations of toluene and DCM with a space velocity of 40,000 ml(g & sdot;h)- 1. These findings can provide valuable insights for the development of chlorine-resistant catalysts with promising application prospects.

TI Facile synthesis of N-doped TiO2 and its photocatalytic
   properties for ciprofloxacin degradation
SO FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS LETTERS
AB The preparation of N-doped TiO2 with excellent photocatalytic performance is reported. The study of the synthesis process involves the control of N-doping and the crystalline phase. The incorporation of urea provides dual features; it introduces a nitrogen source and also reduces the phase transition temperature of anatase to rutile. The optimal N-doped catalyst that possesses both anatase and rutile phases shows excellent catalytic efficiency in the degradation of ciprofloxacin under illumination by visible light and sunlight.

TI Enabling high loading of well-dispersed Ni2CoP2
   catalysts on a 3D-printed electrode for efficient electrocatalysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The loadings of well-dispersed non-noble catalysts on traditional electrocatalytic electrodes are far below the commercial loading requirement of more than 10 mg cm(-2), resulting in poor electrocatalytic performance. Herein, 20.3 mg cm(-2) of well-dispersed Ni2CoP2 catalysts were successfully loaded on a 3D-printed graphene/carbon nanotube (3DP GC)-thick electrode, which demonstrates a large linear improvement in urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performances compared to the low loadings of Ni2CoP2 catalysts on 3DP GC thin electrodes. As a result, the 18-layer 3DP GC/Ni2CoP2 electrode demonstrates the low potential of 1.31 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the alkaline UOR, which is much better than those demonstrated by traditional electrodes, such as carbon paper, carbon cloth, and nickel foam with the same Ni2CoP2 loading. This work paves the way for realizing the high loading of various well-dispersed catalysts on electrodes for high-performance electrocatalysis at low potentials.

TI Reconstruction of the Metabolic Potential of Acidophilic
   Sideroxydans Strains from the Metagenome of an Microaerophilic
   Enrichment Culture of Acidophilic Iron-Oxidizing Bacteria from a Pilot
   Plant for the Treatment of Acid Mine Drainage Reveals Metabolic
   Versatility and Adaptation to Life at Low pH
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Bacterial community analyses of samples from a pilot plant for the treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) from the lignite-mining district in Lusatia (East Germany) had previously demonstrated the dominance of two groups of acidophilic iron oxidizers: the novel candidate genus "Ferrovum" and a group comprising Gallionella-like strains. Since pure culture had proven difficult, previous studies have used genome analyses of co-cultures consisting of "Ferrovum" and a strain of the heterotrophic acidophile Acidiphilium in order to obtain insight into the life style of these novel bacteria. Here we report on attempts to undertake a similar study on Gallionella-like acidophiles from AMD. Isolates belonging to the family Gallionellaceae are still restricted to the microaerophilic and neutrophilic iron oxidizers Sideroxydans and Gallionella. Availability of genomic or metagenomic sequence data of acidophilic strains of these genera should, therefore, be relevant for defining adaptive strategies in pH homeostasis. This is particularly the case since complete genome sequences of the neutrophilic strains G. capsiferriformans ES-2 and S. lithotrophicus ES-1 permit the direct comparison of the metabolic capacity of neutrophilic and acidophilic members of the same genus and, thus, the detection of biochemical features that are specific to acidophilic strains to support life under acidic conditions. Isolation attempts undertaken in this study resulted in the microaerophilic enrichment culture ADE-12-1 which, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, consisted of at least three to four distinct Gallionellaceae strains that appear to be closely related to the neutrophilic iron oxidizer S. lithotrophicus ES-1. Key hypotheses inferred from the metabolic reconstruction of the metagenomic sequence data of these acidophilic Sideroxydans strains include the putative role of urea hydrolysis, formate oxidation and cyanophycin decarboxylation in pH homeostasis.

TI Electrocatalytic synthesis of C-N coupling compounds from CO2
   and nitrogenous species
SO SUSMAT
AB The electrocatalytic synthesis of C-N coupling compounds from CO2 and nitrogenous species not only offers an effective avenue to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce environmental pollution, but also establishes a route to synthesize valuable chemicals, such as urea, amide, and amine. This innovative approach expands the application range and product categories beyond simple carbonaceous species in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, which is becoming a rapidly advancing field. This review summarizes the research progress in electrocatalytic urea synthesis, using N-2, NO2-, and NO3- as nitrogenous species, and explores emerging trends in the electrosynthesis of amide and amine from CO2 and nitrogen species. Additionally, the future opportunities in this field are highlighted, including electrosynthesis of amino acids and other compounds containing C-N bonds, anodic C-N coupling reactions beyond water oxidation, and the catalytic mechanism of corresponding reactions. This critical review also captures the insights aimed at accelerating the development of electrochemical C-N coupling reactions, confirming the superiority of this electrochemical method over the traditional techniques.

TI Concentration of C20-22 n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
   acids from Sardinella longiceps and fatty acid stabilization
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LIPID SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from the refined oil from Sardinella longiceps were concentrated by low-temperature crystallization and urea complexation. Low-temperature crystallization (4 degrees C) using acetone:ethylacetate (7:3, v/v) and urea complexation with urea-to-fatty acid ratio of 4:1 (w/w) afforded fatty acid concentrate (FAC) with greater than 60% C(20-22)n-3 fatty acids, and significant increase in NMR olefinic proton integral (at 5.2-5.6). Ethylacetate fractions of seaweeds, Kappaphycus alvarezii, Hypnea musciformis, and Jania rubens, which possessed greater antioxidant activities, were added to FAC individually, and in nine factorial combinations (0.5%, w/w). The oxidative stabilities of these treatments were compared with FAC added with BHT and -tocopherol in an accelerated storage study. A synergistic effect of ethylacetate fractions from K. alvarezii, H. musciformis, and J. rubens used at 0.1:0.2:0.2 (%, w/w) in preventing the oxidative degradation of FAC was observed. No traces of aromatics ( 6-7) and aldehydes ( 9-10) were present in the H-1-NMR spectra of FAC added with seaweed extracts after the accelerated storage study, demonstrating that the seaweed extracts were able to prevent the formation of low molecular weight secondary oxidation products in the unsaturated system during storage. Practical applications: The present study demonstrated the process of concentrating the refined oil of S. longiceps using a step-wise process of low-temperature crystallization and urea complexation, which is significant to obtain greater than 60% C(20-22)n-3 fatty acids. The fatty acid concentrate has greater susceptibility towards oxidative rancidity resulting in the formation of toxic end products, and therefore, the prevention of oxidative deterioration of n-3 fatty acid concentrates is a major challenge for the fish oil industry. Effectiveness of seaweed derived antioxidatives as natural alternatives to synthetic antioxidants to prevent the formation of oxidation products in the concentrated fatty acids from fish oil has been established. The utility of nuclear magnetic resonance analyses as an effective tool for analyzing the chemistry and stability of concentrated n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been demonstrated. This study is significant to produce stabilized fatty acid concentrate from marine fish oil for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Refined oil from Sardinella longiceps was concentrated by urea complexation to yield fatty acid concentrate (FAC) with greater than 60% C(20-22)n-3 fatty acids, and a significant increase in H-1-NMR olefinic proton integral ( 5.2-5.6). No traces of aromatics ( 6-7) and aldehydes ( 9-10) were present in H-1-NMR of FAC added with seaweed extracts after accelerated storage, demonstrating that seaweed extracts could prevent the formation of low molecular weight secondary oxidation products in the unsaturated system during storage.

TI Blocking AMPK signalling to acetyl-CoA carboxylase increases
   cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and suppresses the benefit of
   metformin
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is accompanied by dysregulation of cellular energy metabolism and accumulation of intracellular lipid. Phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibits fatty acid synthesis and promotes fatty acid oxidation (FAO), vital for kidney tubular epithelial cells (TECs). The diabetes drug metformin is protective in models of AKI; however, it is not known whether ACC phosphorylation plays a role. Methods: Cisplatin-induced AKI (CI-AKI) was established in ACC1/2 double knock-in (ACC1/2DKI) mice, har-bouring mutations that disrupt fatty acid metabolism, and the role of metformin was studied in this model. Outcomes measured included serum biochemistry, expression of kidney injury markers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and metabolomic analysis. Findings: ACC1/2DKI mice demonstrated more severe CI-AKI than wild type (WT), as assessed by serum urea and creatinine, histological injury, and expression of NGAL and interleukin-6. Metformin protected against AKI in WT mice, shown by reduced NGAL, but this effect was absent in ACC1/2DKI mice. In cultured TECs exposed to cisplatin, metformin reduced expression of cleaved caspase-3, however, this effect was diminished in ACC1/2DKI TECs. Analysis of kidney polar metabolites found numerous differences between metformin-treated CI-AKI in ACC1/2DKI and WT mice, involving multiple pathways of amino acid, nucleoside, and energy metabolism. Interpretation: Severity of CI-AKI is exacerbated by the inability to regulate metabolism via phosphorylation of ACC. ACC phosphorylation contributes to the protective effect of metformin against AKI, influencing multiple mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of kidney injury.

TI Fe-doped -Al2O3 porous hollow microspheres for
   enhanced oxidative desulfurization: facile fabrication and reaction
   mechanism
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB We report here a facile approach for the construction of 3D Fe-doped -Al2O3. In this method, by the addition of urea and citric acid during synthesis, hollow spheres with a multi-modal porous structure can be successfully produced. The obtained Fe-doped -Al2O3 microspheres are about 0.8-1.5 m in diameter with a shell thickness of 200 nm. Compared with -Al2O3, the Fe-doped -Al2O3 catalysts exhibit enhanced activity in the selective oxidation of H2S. According to the results of systematic studies, it is inferred that both Lewis acid sites and chemically adsorbed oxygen at oxygen vacancies have a great influence on catalytic activity. In addition, the nature of active sites and the reaction mechanism for H2S selective oxidation over these catalysts are disclosed.

TI Promotional effect of phosphorus addition on improving the
   SO2 resistance of
   V2O5-MoO3/TiO2 catalyst for
   NH3-SCR of NO
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS
AB The oxidation of SO2 into SO3 promote the formation of NH4HSO4 (ABS), which can cover surface active sites catalyst, and then leading to the decrease of NH3-SCR De-NOx activity. In this work, phosphorus species were loaded on the V2O5-MoO3/TiO2 De-NOx catalyst to enhance its SO2 resistance via inhibiting the SO2/SO3 conversion. XRD and N-2-adsorption results showed that phosphorus has little impact on the structure and pore property of the catalyst. The results of XPS, H-2-TPR, and NH3-TPD analyses illustrated that suitable amount of phosphorus (1%) increases the content of polymeric vanadate and chemisorbed oxygen (O-alpha) of the catalyst, which is benefit to the SCR process. Phosphorus species decreases the SO2 absorbability and SO2 oxidation activity of V-Mo-P/Ti catalysts, thus it exhibits higher NH3-SCR activity than that of the P-free catalyst at presence of SO2 due to the lower SO2/SO3 conversion and fewer amount of NH4HSO4 deposition.

TI Manipulation of Electron Spins with Oxygen Vacancy on
   Amorphous/Crystalline Composite-Type Catalyst
SO ACS NANO
AB By substituting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR), it not only reduces energy consumption for green hydrogen generation but also allows purification of urea-rich wastewater. Spin engineering of the d orbital and oxygen-containing adsorbates has been recognized as an effective pathway for enhancing the performance of electrocatalysts. In this work, we report the fabrication of a bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of amorphous RuO2-coated NiO ultrathin nanosheets (a-RuO2/NiO) with abundant amorphous/crystalline interfaces for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR. Impressively, only 1.372 V of voltage is required to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) over a urea electrolyzer. The increased oxygen vacancies in a-RuO2/NiO by incorporation of amorphous RuO2 enhance the total magnetization and entail numerous spin-polarized electrons during the reaction, which speeds up the UOR reaction kinetics. The density functional theory study reveals that the amorphous/crystalline interfaces promote charge-carrier transfer, and the tailored d-band center endows the optimized adsorption of oxygen-generated intermediates. This kind of oxygen vacancy induced spin-polarized electrons toward boosting HER and UOR kinetics and provides a reliable reference for exploration of advanced electrocatalysts.

TI Greenhouse Gas Emissions from an Irrigated Dairy Forage Rotation as
   Influenced by Fertilizer and Manure Applications
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
AB Information is needed regarding the effect of N source on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from irrigated semiarid agricultural soils. We report N2O, CO2, and CH4 emissions from a silage corn (Zea mays L.) (2013)-barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (2014)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (2015) rotation under conventional tillage and sprinkler irrigation. We evaluated the effectiveness of an enhanced-efficiency fertilizer (SuperU, a stabilized granular urea with urease and nitrification inhibitors) to reduce N2O emissions compared with granular urea and to determine GHG emissions from fall-applied dairy manure or composted dairy manure and spring-applied dairy manure. Nitrogen was applied during the first 2 yr of the study. SuperU plots emitted 53% less N2O than urea with corn, whereas no emission reductions occurred in 2014 with barley. The N2O-N emission losses as a percentage of total N applied were 0.21 and 0.04% for urea and SuperU in 2013, respectively, with losses of 0.05% from both urea fertilizers in 2014. On average, N2O fluxes from fall and spring manure were statistically similar and greater than the other N treatments in 2014 and a lasting manure treatment effect on emissions occurred under alfalfa. Carbon dioxide fluxes were greatest from fall-and spring-applied manure during the first 2 yr. Methane fluxes were negative, indicating microbial oxidation, and no differences occurred among the treatments. Corn, barley, and alfalfa yields were similar among all N treatments. This work demonstrates that SuperU can reduce N-2 O emissions from irrigated cropping systems in the semiarid western United States without affecting yields.

TI Nitrogen-modified manganese oxide activated peroxymonosulfate for

SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Nitrogen anion doping has been considered as an effective strategy to modulate the electronic structure of transition metal oxides and improve their catalysis. However, the roles of interstitial and substitutional N sites in PMS activation remained be unclear. To address this issue, N-doped MnOx with different N configurations were synthesized through calcining their precursors at different temperatures with urea. The incorporation of N atom into manganese oxide lattice remarkably enhanced the catalytic activity. Correspondingly, N-Mn-300/PMS system obtained a removal rate of 99.8% and mineralization rate of 87.8%, whose kobs (0.1067 min-1) was 16.1and 12.4-folds higher than that of raw epsilon-MnO2 (0.0066 min-1) and Mn-300 (0.0086 min-1). Such promotion was mainly attributed to the decreased electron cloud density of Mn neighboring interstitial N atom, which provided a driving force to induce transfer electron from PMS to Mn, subsequently causing PMS oxidation into 1O2. By contrast, the substitutional N increased the electron density of Mn and exhibited a minor promotion effect in the enhanced catalysis. A possible catalytic mechanism of Mn(II) -> Mn(III) <- 1O2Mn(IV) was proposed. Notably, it was newly discovered that this K2Cr2O7-induced inhibition was attributed to the catalytic site consumption of N-Mn-300 by K2Cr2O7, rather than K2Cr2O7-quenching free electron. This work highlights the primary role of interstitial N site in regulating the electronic structure of manganese oxide to strengthen peroxymonosulfate activation.

TI A one-pot "shielding-to-etching" strategy to synthesize amorphous
   MoS2 modified CoS/Co0.85Se heterostructured
   nanotube arrays for boosted energy-saving H2 generation
SO NANOSCALE
AB In this study, a facile one-pot "shielding-to-etching" strategy has been designed for the synthesis of amorphous MoS2 modified CoS/Co0.85Se heterostructured nanotube arrays (a-MoS2/CoS/Co0.85Se HNTs) as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for boosted energy-saving H-2 production, using Co(OH)(x)(CO3)(y) nanorods as the template. Interestingly, these multi-composition and hollow structured products were achieved in a controllable manner via only a one-pot synthesis, in which the nanorods with shielding layers were firstly obtained and then converted into nanotubes through further etching reaction. Benefiting from the combined nature of multiple-component hollow nanostructures, the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst is efficiently modulated, the electron transfer and ion diffusion pathways are effectively shortened and abundant active sites are created, which leads to excellent activity for urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions with the as-prepared a-MoS2/CoS/Co0.85Se HNTs being employed as the electrodes. As a result, the whole urea electrolysis cell exhibits a driven voltage of only 1.42 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing most reported transition-metal-based electrocatalysts. Moreover, a battery-assisted urea electrolyzer was assembled as well to demonstrate the feasibility of practical less-energy-intensive H-2 generation. The method developed in this work is expected to broaden the way of designing and synthesizing multiple-component hollow nanostructures for various applications.

TI A Dialdehyde Starch-Based Adhesive For Medium-Density Fiberboards
SO BIORESOURCES
AB Bio-based adhesives have gained considerable attention in the last years as more sustainable and healthier alternatives to the formaldehyde-based adhesives used today in wood-based panel manufacturing. In this study, dialdehyde starch (DAS) with various aldehyde contents was prepared by using sodium metaperiodate as an oxidizing agent. Characterizations were performed by employing Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and thermal stability analysis. Different adhesive compositions were used for making medium-density fiberboard (MDF) panels. They were based on DAS (12 wt% based on fiber), emulsifiable diphenylmethane diisocyanate (eMDI, 2-4 wt% based on DAS), and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC, 0.5-1.0 wt% based on DAS). Fibers and the adhesive components were mixed with a combination of dry mixing and wet spraying. The physical and mechanical properties of MDF panels bonded with different DAS-based adhesives were compared with those of melamine urea-formaldehyde (MUF) adhesive and sole eMDI. The results showed that the MDF panels made with DAS-MFCeMDI of 99.52% bio-based content showed comparable properties to standard panels with a commercial MUF adhesive. It was implied that DAS in the presence of small amount of eMDI can create strong bonds with wood fibers, while an additional positive effect on bonding was due to the contact surface enlargement of MFC.

TI Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from irrigated rice cultivation
   through improved fertilizer and water management
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture sector play an important role for global warming and climate change. Thus, it is necessary to find out GHG emissions mitigation strategies from rice cultivation. The efficient management of nitrogen fertilizer using urea deep placement (UDP) and the use of the water-saving alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation could mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce environmental pollution. However, there is a dearth of studies on the impacts of UDP and the integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) which combines poultry manure and prilled urea (PU) with different irrigation regimes on GHG emissions, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and rice yields. We conducted field experiments during the dry seasons of 2018, 2019, and 2020 to compare the effects of four fertilizer treatments including control (no N), PU, UDP, and IPNS in combination with two irrigation systems- (AWD and continuous flooding, CF) on GHG emissions, NUE and rice yield. Fertilizer treatments had significant (p < 0.05) interaction effects with irrigation regimes on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. PU reduced CH4 and N2O emissions by 6% and 20% compared to IPNS treatment, respectively under AWD irrigation, but produced similar emissions under CF irrigation. Similarly, UDP reduced cumulative CH4 emissions by 9% and 15% under AWD irrigation, and 9% and 11% under CF condition compared to PU and IPNS treatments, respectively. Across the year and fertilizer treatments, AWD irrigation significantly (p < 0.05) reduced cumulative CH4 emissions and GHG intensity by 28%, and 26%, respectively without significant yield loss compared to CF condition. Although AWD irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions by 73%, it reduced the total global warming potential by 27% compared to CF irrigation. The CH4 emission factor for AWD was lower (1.67 kg ha(-1) day(-1)) compared to CF (2.33 kg ha(-1)& nbsp;day(-1)). Across the irrigation regimes, UDP increased rice yield by 21% and N recovery efficiency by 58% compared to PU. These results suggest that both UDP and AWD irrigation might be considered as a carbon-friendly technology.

TI In situ growth of S-incorporated CoNiFe(oxy)hydroxide nanoarrays
   as efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Ni-, Co-based (oxy)hydroxides have received considerable attentions as promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and even overall urea/water splitting. Constructing catalysts with a special morphological and electronic structure is still an effective strategy to further enhance their electrocatalytic performances. Herein, we report a facile, versatile, and scalable method to grow S-incorporated CoNiFe(oxy)hydroxides (CoNiFeS-OH) nanosheets on needle-like CoNi(oxy)hydroxides (CoNi-OH) nanoarrays under hydrothermal conditions. The special morphology provided more active sites and facilitated mass transfer. In particular, Fe and S incorporation modified the electronic structure of CoNi-OH, boosts its electronic conductivity, provided metals in high valent states, and created a crystalline/amorphous phase interface, thus intrinsically improving the electrocatalytic performance toward OER, UOR, and even overall water splitting/urea electrolysis. The CoNiFeS-OH nanosheets therefore showed superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 192 and 272 mV to reach a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. For UOR, the potential was measured to be as low as 1.329 and 1.373 V at a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, a quite low cell voltages of 1.571 and 1.461 V for overall water splitting and overall urea electrolysis were respectively detected to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which were superior to the benchmark Pt/C//RuO2 and other reported Ni, Co-based (oxy)hydroxides. More importantly, the voltage differences required for overall urea electrolysis and overall water splitting at a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) were 0.110 and 0.153 V. Additionally, the CoNiFeS-OH electrocatalysts also showed great stability during long-term (20 h) and cycling (1000 cycles) measurements.

TI Nitrogen cycling and environmental impacts in upland agricultural soils
   in North China: A review
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB The upland agricultural soils in North China are distributed north of a line between the Kunlun Mountains, the Qinling Mountains and the Huaihe River. They occur in arid, semi-arid and semi-humid regions and crop production often depends on rain-fed or irrigation to supplement rainfall. This paper summarizes the characteristics of gross nitrogen (N) transformation, the fate of N fertilizer and soil N as well as the N loss pathway, and makes suggestions for proper N management in the region. The soils of the region are characterized by strong N mineralization and nitrification, and weak immobilization and denitrification ability, which lead to the production and accumulation of nitrate in the soil profile. Large amounts of accumulated nitrate have been observed in the vadose-zone in soils due to excess N fertilization in the past three decades, and this nitrate is subject to occasional leaching which leads to groundwater nitrate contamination. Under farmer's conventional high N fertilization practice in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system (N application rate was approximately 600 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), crop N uptake, soil residual N, NH3 volatilization, NO3- leaching, and denitrification loss accounted for around 27, 30, 23, 18 and 2% of the applied fertilizer N, respectively. NH3 volatilization and NO3- leaching were the most important N loss pathways while soil residual N was an important fate of N fertilizer for replenishing soil N depletion from crop production. The upland agricultural soils in North China are a large source of N2O and total emissions in this region make up a large proportion (approximately 54%) of Chinese cropland N2O emissions. The "non-coupled strong ammonia oxidation" process is an important mechanism of N2O production. Slowing down ammonia oxidation after ammonium-N fertilizer or urea application and avoiding transient high soil NH4+ concentrations are key measures for reducing N2O emissions in this region. Further N management should aim to minimize N losses from crop and livestock production, and increase the recycling of manure and straw back to cropland. We also recommend adoption of the 4R (Right soure, Right rate, Right time, Right place) fertilization techniques to realize proper N fertilizer management, and improving application methods or modifying fertilizer types to reduce NH3 volatilization, improving water management to reduce NO3- leaching, and controlling the strong ammonia oxidation process to abate N2O emission. Future research should focus on the study of the trade-off effects among different N loss pathways under different N application methods or fertilizer products.

TI TEMPO-Oxidized Cellulose Beads for Cationic Dye Adsorption
SO BIORESOURCES
AB Toxic organic dyes present in wastewater should be removed before discharge. In this study, TEMPO-oxidized, regenerated cellulose beads were prepared using a simple falling ball technique for cationic methylene blue (MB) removal. The obtained cellulose beads were characterized using various analytical techniques. The results indicated that TEMPO-oxidized cellulose beads displayed porous structures with high content of carboxylic acid groups. Thus, the negatively charged cellulose beads can effectively adsorb cationic MB with an adsorption capacity of 495 mg/g at a starting concentration of 100 mg/L. This simple one-step adsorption process achieved near-complete MB removal at pH 7, indicating strong electrostatic interactions between cationic MB and negatively charged oxidized cellulose beads. The experimental data can be well described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the Pseudo-second-order model. The fabricated cellulose beads exhibit great potential for practical application in dye removal from wastewater.

TI Constructing a novel pH-mediated magnetic relaxation sensor via the Mn
   (II)/Mn(IV) conversion
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Herein, we demonstrate a new concept of chemical sensing for the construction of pH-mediated magnetic sensors. The strategy is based on the notion that the oxidation of paramagnetic Mn2+ ions to insoluble Mn(IV)O (OH)2 by dissolved oxygen under alkaline conditions can lead to a significant decrease in the transverse relaxation rate (1/T2) of water protons. Crucially, the conversion of Mn2+ ions to MnO(OH)2 correlates with the amount of NaOH, that is, the reaction is pH-dependent. Thus, by combining this reaction with enzymatic reactions that cause pH changes, we can construct pH-mediated chemical sensors based on magnetic relaxation principles. In this work, we selected glucose and urea as model substrates to verify the feasibility of this strategy, since the oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase and the hydrolysis of urea by urease lead to a notable decrease and increase of pH, respectively, thereby causing a change in the 1/T2 of the solution. Experimental results showed that the linear detection range was 20-2000 mu M with a detection limit of 10 mu M for glucose, and 50-1000 mu M with a detection limit of 20 mu M for urea, validating the proof of concept and potential broad applicability of this strategy.

TI Valorizing lignite waste into engineered nitro-humic fertilizer:
   Advancing resource efficiency in the era of a circular economy
SO SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY
AB This study investigates using lignite waste as a carrier matrix for creating engineered nitro-humic fertilizer (NHF). The NHF is synthesized through an innovative ozone oxidation method and nitrogen enrichment. Agronomic efficiency was evaluated through maize growth responses, soil incubation experiments, and fertilizer performance, comparing NHF to commercial urea and NPK fertilizers. Nitrogen release patterns and kinetic models were studied to understand the nitrogen release mechanism of NHF. The engineered structure of NHF displayed globular-like, microporous, and heterogeneous properties, with a negative charge density of 48.85 mV and lower thermal stability of aliphatic carbons. The NHF exhibited a remarkable capability to increase waterholding capacity by up to 48% and extend the water-retention period by 57% during 30 d of soil application. NHF significantly reduced soil urease enzyme activity by more than two-fold. It exhibited a longer nitrogen release period (77 d) with a slow-release pattern, releasing 71.75% of total nitrogen compared to 88.5% in 14 d for urea. The simple Elovich model accurately pre dicted NHF's nitrogen release kinetics (R2 = 0.9943), identifying Fickian diffusion-based controlled release. Applying NHF improved multiple aspects of maize growth: height, stem diameter, biomass, root weight, leaf area, SPAD value, and leaf nitrogen concentration. Total chlorophyll, carotenoid, and nitrogen uptake also greatly increased compared to the control sample. NHF exhibited superior nitrogen use efficiency (41.5%) and agronomic fertilizer efficiency (36.22%) compared to urea and even surpassed commercial NPK fertilizers. Generally, the produced NHF is an eco-friendly alternative to slow-release fertilizers, offering the advantages of humic substances and nitrogen fertilizers.

TI A technical review on low temperature combustion alternatives for
   ultra-low emission vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF THE ENERGY INSTITUTE
AB Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions have always been considered as the primary concern for the development of diesel engines. Several post-treatment technologies have also been developed to fulfil the stringent standards for NOx emissions that cannot be controlled by fuel composition and combustion reaction. At present, the aftertreatment technologies employed include Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Lean NOx Traps and SCR filtering. The current review article summarizes the investigations conducted earlier about the reduction of NOx emissions from lean-burn engines and discusses the benefits and limitations of different types of SCRs. Among the available technologies, the urea SCR process is ultimately the most efficient process using Ad blue technology. Urea SCR process uses NH3 reduction agents to achieve 98% conversion efficiency. The article discussed some of the operating parameters such as the nature of catalytic material, the range temperature of the catalyst and the mixing of NH3 and NOx. Hybrid SCR such as the metals-impregnated SCR (M-SCR, HC- SCR, SCR + LNT) moderately increases the catalytic activity and converts the exhaust gas into less harmful gases even at low temperature. The novelty of the work, debates about the outrivaling importance of oxidation catalyst of the modern diesel exhaust purification systems, techniques for enhancement and the optimization of oxidation catalysts that are aimed at NOx and hydrocarbon conversion and the methods for reducing the Platinum Group Metal (PGM) content in these catalytic systems via combination devices for thermal energy and further optimization and material cost attenuation. There exists a requisite for continuous investigation of PM control technology that comprises of regenerating systems to reduce the complexity of these systems and concomitant fuel economic penalties. Future research works should be conducted extensively with different additives, substrate materials, regenerating systems, and controls to develop optimal devices that are capable of reducing the diesel particulate emissions levels.

TI L-carnitine supplementation descreases hepatic triglyceride accumulation
   in Holstein cows during the transition period
SO REVISTA COLOMBIANA DE CIENCIAS PECUARIAS
AB Background: The increased use of body reserves observed during peripartum leads to higher needs of L-carnitine by cows, which is restrictive under the production conditions of Colombian high tropics. Objective: To evaluate the lipotropic potential of L-carnitine in Holstein dairy cows during the transition period to lactation. Methods: Twenty-one Holstein cows were fed 0, 100, or 200 g/d L-carnitine fumarate from d 260 of gestation to d 20 postpartum. Hepatic triacylglycerides concentration, total carnitine, free carnitine, acylcarnitine, and serum levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) and urea were determined by spectrophotometry. Repeated measures analysis was used to determine the effects of dose, measurement period, and their interactions. Results: Hepatic triglycerides and the different forms of carnitine showed no difference between sampling periods (p>0.05). Hepatic triglycerides concentration was low and decreased in response to 200 g/d L-carnitine fumarate supplementation (p<0.05). This decrease in hepatic triglycerides could be due to increased fatty acid oxidation. L-carnitine supplementation significantly increased (p<0.05) blood urea concentration, possibly through stimulation of the urea cycle, as previously described in other species. Conclusion: Supplementation with L-carnitine decreased the hepatic concentration of triglycerides, possibly due to increased liver oxidation of fatty acids.

TI Green preparation of branched biolubricant by chemically modifying waste
   cooking oil with lipase and ionic liquid
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB To reduce the environment pollution from biolubricant synthesis, in this study, we developed a green and efficient strategy for the preparation of octylated branched biolubricant from waste cooking oil (WCO): (1) WCO was first hydrolyzed by a lipase (Candida sp. 99-125) to produce unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), the latter was subsequently concentrated by urea complexation; (2) Next, we synthesized new esters using the UFAs as substrate via esterification with 2-ethylhexanol employing lipase (Novozym 435) and the new esters products were further epoxidated; (3) After that, the epoxy group was attacked by a low-cost nucleophilic reagent, octanoic acid, to prepare octylated branched biolubricant using an recyclable ionic liquid, [HMIm][PF6], as catalyst. After three recycling times, [HMIm][PF6] remained catalytic activity with a conversion yield of 81.22% and selectivity of 82.10%. The obtained product showed excellent lubricant properties, such as low pour point of -61 degrees C, high viscosity index of 149 and high thermal-oxidation stability (onset temperature of 326.35 degrees C and oxidative onset temperature of 312.06 degrees C). The high frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) measurement demonstrated that lubrication performance (friction coefficient of 0.09 and wear spot diameter of 203 mm) was much better than that of mineral based lubricant with the same viscosity grade. Therefore, this study provided a critical synthetic strategy for preparing high-performance biolubricants from WCO. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Impact of pregnancy on inborn errors of metabolism
SO REVIEWS IN ENDOCRINE & METABOLIC DISORDERS
AB Once based mainly in paediatrics, inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), or inherited metabolic disorders (IMD) represent a growing adult medicine specialty. Individually rare these conditions have currently, a collective estimated prevalence of >1:800. Diagnosis has improved through expanded newborn screening programs, identification of potentially affected family members and greater awareness of symptomatic presentations in adolescence and in adulthood. Better survival and reduced mortality from previously lethal and debilitating conditions means greater numbers transition to adulthood. Pregnancy, once contraindicated for many, may represent a challenging but successful outcome. Successful pregnancies are now reported in a wide range of IEM. Significant challenges remain, given the biological stresses of pregnancy, parturition and the puerperium. Known diagnoses allow preventive and pre-emptive management. Unrecognized metabolic disorders especially, remain a preventable cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. Increased awareness of these conditions amongst all clinicians is essential to expedite diagnosis and manage appropriately. This review aims to describe normal adaptations to pregnancy and discuss how various types of IEM may be affected. Relevant translational research and clinical experience will be reviewed with practical management aspects cited. Based on current literature, the impact of maternal IEM on mother and/or foetus, as well as how foetal IEM may affect the mother, will be considered. Insights gained from these rare disorders to more common conditions will be explored. Gaps in the literature, unanswered questions and steps to enhance further knowledge and systematically capture experience, such as establishment of an IEM-pregnancy registry, will be summarized.

TI A solvent-free method to rapidly synthesize CuO-CeO2
   catalysts to enhance their CO preferential oxidation: Effects of Cu
   loading and calcination temperature
SO MOLECULAR CATALYSIS
AB A facile and solvent-free route has been developed to rapidly synthesize CuO-CeO2 catalysts within 30 min. The effect of calcination temperature on catalytic performances is more significant than Cu loading, and the optimal calcination temperature and Cu loading are 700 degrees C and 7.5 wt.%, respectively. The optimal catalyst 7.5CuCe-SF-700 exhibits the highest CO conversion and the corresponding temperature window for full CO conversion is as wide as 50 degrees C. According to the characterization results of XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption, H-2-TPR, TEM, HR-TEM, STEM, EDS, Raman and XPS, it can be concluded that the high-performances of CuO-CeO2 catalyst should be attributed to synergistic effects of high dispersion Cu species and CeO2, and the presence of more reduced copper species as the active site in the catalyst. 7.5CuCe-SF-700 exhibits excellent stability for CO-PROX during the 200 time-on-stream test under actual reaction conditions (with 15% CO2 and 10% H2O). In addition, surfactant template, urea gelation/co-precipitation and sol-gel methods were used to synthesize CuO-CeO2 catalysts so as to compare them with 7.5CuCe-SF-700, and the results exhibit not only 7.5CuCe-SF-700 is superior to the former three catalysts but also our synthesis route is more simple, controllable, solvent-free, time-saving and energy-saving.

TI Development of copper foam-based composite catalysts for electrolysis of

SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB As a cost-effective and environmentally friendly secondary energy source, hydrogen energy is one of the top future targets for the development of clean energy. The electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen is the most efficient and environmentally friendly technology for developing hydrogen energy. There is an urgent demand to develop electrolytic hydrogen production catalysts, which should possess characteristics such as nontoxicity, easy synthesis, abundant resources, high electrocatalytic properties and stability. Besides, excellent performance of substrate electrode materials is also one of the keys to improve catalytic performance of the materials. Copper foams (CF) are used as electrode substrates due to their high electrical conductivity, highly porous three-dimensional (3D) network structure, and low cost. We discussed recent progress in the direct construction of nanomaterials on 3D copper foams as advanced composite catalysts for electrochemical water electrolysis, as well as the applications of copper foams in the urea oxidation reaction, the methanol oxidation reaction and electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, and offered prospects and perspectives for the future growth of novel materials on 3D substrates in this review.

TI Synergistic Coupling of Nickel Boride with Ru Cluster as a Highly Active
   Multifunctional Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting and Glucose
   Electrolysis
SO ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS
AB The development of highly active electrocatalysts is of great importance toward the practical applications of many meaningful electrocatalytic reactions. In this paper, the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of a multifunctional ruthenium nickel boride hybrid electrocatalyst are reported for the first time. Compared to pristine nickel boride (Ni-B) and Ru electrocatalysts, Ru@Ni-B with trace Ru loading amount of 0.133 mg cm(-2) prepared by a simple wet chemical method, shows remarkably improved activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, and the glucose oxidation reaction. The electrolytic cell assembled with Ru@Ni-B/nickel foam electrode as both cathode and anode can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.42 V for alkaline overall water splitting and 1.24 V for glucose electrolysis. It is further found that the synergistic coupling of ruthenium with nickel boride plays an important role in the superior performance of the hybrid electrocatalyst.

TI Metabolomic Assessment of Acute Cholestatic Injuries Induced by

   Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction
SO FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction, a traditional Chinese formula, has been reported to protect liver from various injuries. Two cholestasis models of rats induced by thioacetamide and by bile duct ligation were established and treated with Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-based urinary metabolic profiles were analyzed by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis and univariate analysis to excavate differential metabolites associated with the injuries of the two models and the treatment effects of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction. The two cholestatic models shared common metabolic features of excessive fatty acid oxidation, insufficient glutathione regeneration and disturbed gut flora, with specific characteristics of inhibited urea cycle and DNA damage in thioacetamide-intoxicated model, and perturbed Kreb's cycle and inhibited branched chain amino acid oxidation in bile duct ligation model. With good treatment effects, Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction could regain the balance of the disturbed metabolic status common in the two cholestasis injuries, e.g., unbalanced redox system and disturbed gut flora; and perturbed urea cycle in thioacetamide-intoxicated model and energy crisis (disturbed Kreb's cycle and oxidation of branched chain amino acid) in bile duct ligation model, respectively.

   layered Nb doped C3N4 for extended linearity range
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Ultrathin layered graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) doped with niobium (Nb) metal has been prepared from urea by pyrolysis method and applied for direct glucose sensing in human blood. Two different oxidation peaks during both forward and reverse potential scanning were observed, similar to metal electrodes, indicating the metallic behavior of the g-Nb-C3N4. The oxidation peak appeared at 0.39 V indicates the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone, which gets further oxidized to CO2 and H2O during reverse scan indicated by the appearance of very intense reverse peak. The sensor gave an extended wide dynamic range from 0.5 mM to 200 mM with an excellent sensitivity of 1.62 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). Micahelis-Menten kinetic constant K-M of 181 mM observed is 100 times higher than the un-doped g-C3N4. The developed sensor electrode is tested for glucose sensing in the human blood samples and showed good signal recovery for 4 times reuse.

TI Energy recovery through reverse electrodialysis: Harnessing the salinity
   gradient from the flushing of human urine
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Urine dilution is often performed to avoid clogging or scaling of pipes, which occurs due to urine's Ca2+ and Mg2+ precipitating at the alkaline conditions created by ureolysis. The large salinity gradient between urine and flushing water is, theoretically, a source of potential energy which is currently unexploited. As such, this work explored the use of a compact reverse electrodialysis (RED) system to convert the chem-ical potential energy of urine dilution into electric energy. Urine' composition and ureolysis state as well as solution pumping costs were all taken into account. Despite having almost double its electric conductivity, real hydrolysed urine obtained net energy recoveries E-Net of 0.053-0.039 kWh/m(3), which is similar to energy recovered from real fresh urine. The reduced performances of hydrolysed urine were linked to its higher organic fouling potential and possible volatilisation of NH3 due to its high pH. However, the higher-than-expected performance achieved by fresh urine is possibly due to the fast diffusion of uncharged urea to the freshwater side. Real urine was also tested as a novel electrolyte solution and its performance compared with a conventional K4Fe(CN)(6)/K3Fe(CN)(6) couple. While K4Fe(CN)(6)/K3Fe(CN)(6) outperformed urine in terms of power densities and energy recoveries, net chemical reactions seemed to have occurred in urine when used as an electrolyte solution, leading to TOC, ammonia and urea removal of up to 13%, 6% and 4.4%, respectively. Finally, due to the migration of K+, NH4+ and PO43-, the low concentration solution could be utilised for fertigation. Overall, this process has the potential of providing off-grid urine treatment or energy production at a household or building level. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electrolysis is potentially a valuable method for cleansing waste water. Chemically the process is ultra-fast and highly complex. In the present study the products formed at the cathode and anode are investigated using Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics. To make a start into this vast field, relatively simple mixtures are investigated. The simulations of the anodic process are performed for urea and uric acid in water containing discharged hydroxide. The cathodic process is simulated for urea and uric acid in water with discharged ammonium ions. While at the cathode mainly molecular hydrogen is developed, the chemistry at the anode is rather complex. We observe unstable intermediates which are probably toxic.

   With Clinical Recommendations
SO HEADACHE
AB Background-Inborn errors of metabolism are on the differential for patients presenting with a cyclic vomiting syndrome phenotype. Classes of disorders to consider include: mitochondrial disorders, fatty acid oxidation disorders, urea cycle defects, organic acidurias, and acute intermittent porphyria.
   Aim-This article reviews the metabolic differential diagnosis and approach to screening for inborn errors in children and adults presenting with a cyclic or recurrent vomiting phenotype.
   Conclusion-Cyclic vomiting syndrome is thought to be an episodic syndrome that may be associated with migraine. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. Inborn errors of metabolism should be considered in the patient presenting with a recurrent vomiting phenotype. Mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in cyclic vomiting syndrome, and true mitochondrial disorders can present with a true cyclic vomiting phenotype.

TI Evaluation of brain injury in goats naturally infected with Coenurus
   cerebralis; brain specific biomarkers, acute inflammation, and DNA
   oxidation
SO RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB This investigate goals are to establish the utility of brain-specific biomarkers (GFAP and S100B) in vivo and to assess the brain damage in C. cerebralis-infected goats using histopathological and immunopathological methods. The animal material of the study consisted of 10 healthy and 20 Coenurus cerebralis infected female hair goats. Serum GFAP and S100B concentrations were measured to determine brain damage. Serum S100B (p < 0.037), GFAP (p < 0.012), urea (p < 0.045), GGT (p < 0.001) and ALT (p < 0.001) concentrations in the C.cerebralis group were significantly higher than the control group. There was no significant difference between the C.cerebralis group and the control group for hsTnI (p > 0.078), creatinine (p > 0.099) and CK-MB (p > 0.725). In the histopathological examination, pressure atrophy and related inflammatory changes were observed due to mechanical damage of the parasite. Immunohistochemical examinations revealed that the parasite stimulated inflammation with the expression of TNF-alpha and caused DNA damage with the expression of 8-OHdG. As a result, when the data collected for this study are assessed as a whole, it is thought that the use of brainspecific GFAP and S100B biomarkers may be beneficial in determining brain damage in naturally infected hair goats with C.cerebralis. Changes in the levels of brain-specific biomarkers contribute significantly to determining the prognosis of the disease in vivo. Measurement of GFAP and S100B concentrations from serum offers an important alternative to the CSF method.

TI An Investigation of Facile One-Pot Synthesis of
   Li2FeSiO4/C Composite for Li Ion Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Li2FeSiO4 and its carbon composite are prepared by an urea-assisted combustion method. The synthesis has been carried out in different urea concentrations, namely 1 Molar (M), 2 M and 3 M urea in the cost-effective ambient atmospheric condition. The x-ray diffraction analysis confirms the orthorhombic structure of Li2FeSiO4 compounds. The urea-assisted combustion reaction enhanced the phase purity of the compound and prevented the oxidation of ferrous ions in Li2FeSiO4. The x-ray photo electron spectroscopy analysis further confirmed the reduction of Fe3+ concentration in Li2FeSiO4 while adding urea. The Li2FeSiO4 compound formation in the presence of urea occurred at a temperature < 623 K. The one-pot synthesis of Li2FeSiO4/C with the help of starch and urea in ambient atmospheric condition resulted in Li2FeSiO4 with an orthorhombic crystal structure. The carbon coating in an amorphous nature is observed and the lattice dimension values of Li2FeSiO4/C are 6.248 , 5.330 , and 5.029 . The lattice parameter has remained unchanged with carbon addition. The addition of 5% carbon to Li2FeSiO4 improves the electrical conductivity and lithium diffusion coefficient to 7.24 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) and 5.54 x 10(-6) cm(2), respectively. The coulombic efficiency and capacity retention after 50 cycles of Li2FeSiO4/C composite are around 83% and 95%, respectively.

TI Comparison between endogenous and exogenous nitrogen of nitrogen-doped
   carbon catalyst in the process of activating PMS
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Background: Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) based on sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) have proven to be highly effective in degrading organics in wastewater. Carbon-based materials have emerged as promising catalysts for activating persulfate, which generates environmentally friendly sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-), for remediation purposes. The nitrogen doping technique is an effective method for site-specific regulation and can significantly enhance the performance of carbon-based catalysts, which could promote the application of carbon-based catalysts in the future. Endogenous and exogenous nitrogen sources can provide nitrogen sources for N doping. However, there are few reports on the comparison of the structure and catalytic mechanism of these two types of N-doped biochar. It is also of great significance to reveal the mechanisms of constructing catalytic sites using endogenous and exogenous nitrogen. Methods: Herein, the preparation of endogenous nitrogen-doped biochar (BC) was achieved by using soybean as the precursor material, which is rich in natural nitrogen-containing components of proteins. Subsequently, the BC was doped by mixing it with urea and pyrolysis, resulting in the preparation of exogenous nitrogen-doped biochar (NBC). Significant findings: The characterization of XRD and HRTEM showed that g-C3N4 formed in NBC. The results of catalytic degradation and quenching experiments demonstrate that the exogenous nitrogen-doped catalysts have a better performance than endogenous nitrogen-doped catalysts. The OFL removal rate in BC/PMS was higher than that in the BC/PMS system (71.68% vs. 61.83 %). The kobs in NBC/PMS are also higher than that in BC/PMS (0.00943 min-1 vs. 0.01369 min-1). The NBC could be a promising catalyst for PMS activation in practical application. DFT results showed that the g-C3N4 generated from exogenous nitrogen can improve PMS activation performance in the g-C3N4/graphene bilayer structure. The influence on the charge distribution of surrounding carbon materials makes endogenous nitrogen doping a good choice for optimizing the local performance of the material in the absence of natural nitrogen components.

TI Electrochemically controlled hydrogen bonding for supramolecular
   assembly: Challenges and opportunities
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB The electrostatic nature of the hydrogen bond makes it straightforward, in principle, to electrochemically perturb the strength of hydrogen bonds by using oxidation to create stronger H-donors or reduction to create stronger H-acceptors. However, oxidation or reduction can also lead to proton transfer and subsequent electron transfer, which can nullify the effect of the initial electron transfer. Illustrative examples of these complications based on a series of investigations of electroactive, urea-containing 2 H-bond dimers are described. It is also shown that proton transfer accompanying electron transfer can be used to advantage with two examples of oxidative dissociation of 4 H-bond dimers that are of interest for the construction of supramolecular polymers and gels. In both cases proton transfer is key to achieving the desired outcome. Moving forward, it is argued that proton transfer should always be considered as a possible useful component in the design of electrochemically controllable H-bonding systems.

TI New soft chemistry route to titanomagnetite magnetic nanoparticles with
   enhanced peroxidase-like activity
SO POWDER TECHNOLOGY
AB Titanomagnetite is widely distributed in nature, and has potentials in environmental remediation. Nanometric titanomagnetite particles were usually prepared via soft chemistry routes in aqueous solutions. Herein a novel soft chemistry route carried out in a deep eutectic solvent (DES) comprising choline chloride and urea in a molar ratio of 1:2 was successfully developed to make titanomagnetite nanoparticles (Fe2.5Ti0.5O4-DES, similar to 30 nm). The chemical composition analyzed by different methods revealed that Fe2.5Ti0.5O4-DES nanoparticles possess the Ti-rich core and Fe-rich shell. The Fe2.5Ti0.5O4-DES nanoparticles exhibited enhanced activities in catalytic decomposition of H2O2 and oxidative degradation of organic contaminants at circumneutral pH values and room temperature, which was mainly attributed to the increased content of ferrous (Fe2+) ions upon substitution of Ti4+ for ferric (Fe3+) ions in spine! structure of magnetite.

TI Revealing the mechanism of formation and transformation of chlorinated
   by-products during electrolyzing synthetic urine using
   Ti/RuOx-IrOx and BDD electrodes
SO FUEL CELLS
AB In this study, the mechanism of chlorinated by-products (CBPs) formation and transformation during urine electrolysis was comparatively investigated with active and nonactive electrodes. It was found that nutrients removal and CBPs formation was dominated by the chlorine evolution on the active Ti/RuOx-IrOx electrodes. CBPs formation was inhibited by the ammonia and urea chlorination and kept at a relatively low level before chlorination breakpoint. After the concentration of organic CBPs (OCBPs) increasingly reaching the maximum as a result of the peak concentration of free chlorine, most free chlorine transformed into inorganic chlorination by-products (ICBPs) with the chlorate as the main species. In contrast, the formation of CBPs on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes was jointly dominated by the direct oxidation and chlorine mediated oxidation, which resulted in the complete degradation of OCBPs and the accumulation of ICBPs throughout the electrolysis. The organics with high molecular weight readily formed CBPs. Moreover, higher current density would accelerate the production of ICBPs on both electrodes, although it could mitigate OCBPs production at chlorination breakpoint for Ti/RuOx-IrOx anodes. Separation of chloride ions and organics with high molecular weight from urine using nanofiltration was proposed to mitigate the production of CBPs.

TI Efficient solar-light-driven photoelectrochemical water oxidation of
   one-step in-situ synthesized Co-doped g-C3N4
   nanolayers
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Cobalt-doped g-C3N4 (Co-g-CN) nanolayers were prepared by a single-step thermal treatment with urea and cobalt nitrate. Different amounts of cobalt nitrate were tested to optimize the amount of cobalt dopant in the g-C3N4 (g-CN) matrix. Several characterization methods were used to explore the structural and optical properties along with the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared studies confirmed that g-CN nanolayers were successfully doped with cobalt without disturbing the basic 2-D structure and tris-triazine units of g-CN. Furthermore, microscopy images demonstrated that the cobalt effectively transformed the short nanosheets into long nanolayers. The cobalt-doping enhanced the visible absorption of g-CN and tuned the bandgap from 2.71 to 2.62 eV. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigation discovered that cobalt entered into the g-CN network as Co2+ ions. XPS valence band spectra gave information on the modification in the valence and conduction band edge potentials due to cobalt doping. The photoluminescence intensity from the Co-g-CN samples was lesser than that from g-CN nanosheets, and the PEC activity of the Co-g-CN nanolayers was greater than that of as-prepared g-CN nanosheets. Co-g-CN samples prepared with 15 mg of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate showed a PEC performance of 3.2522 mA/cm(2), which was greater than that of g-CN nanosheets (1.9246 mA/cm(2)). The better PEC performance was ascribed to the synergistic consequence of the higher visible absorption obtained by tuning the bandgap and the host-guest interactions between cobalt and g-CN.

TI Distorted polymeric carbon nitride via carriers transfer bridges with
   superior photocatalytic activity for organic pollutants oxidation and
   hydrogen production under visible light
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has become the most promising metal-free photocatalysts but its activity is low. Molecule doping of PCN has been proved to be an effective strategy to achieve high photocatalytic performance. Herein, we report a bottom-up method to synthesize modified PCN, which includes 2,5-dibromopyrazine doping, thermal-induced exfoliation and condensation/polymerization. The incorporation of electron-deficiency 2,5-dibromopyrazine into the PCN framework can effectively tune the electronic structures and improve the charge-carrier separation. In addition, the incorporation of 2,5-dibromopyrazine induced significant structural changes from planar symmetric to distortion. The optimized pyrazine doped PCN showed a reaction rate enhancement of 4-fold for the degradation of sulfamethazine compared to that of conventional urea-based PCN. Further reactive species and degradation intermediate detection studies, indicated that O-center dot(2)- was generated during the photocatalytic process, which could lead to the decomposition, and finally mineralization of sulfamethazine. 2,5-Dibromopyrazine doped PCN also leads to a 6.3-fold improvement in H-2 generation with the visible light. Especially, phytotoxicity experiments showed that the toxicity of sulfamethazine after degradation is greatly reduced, and the as-prepared photocatalyst is environmentally friendly.

TI Interactions between arsenic and nitrogen regulate nitrogen availability
   and arsenic mobility in flooded paddy soils
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB In paddy soils, arsenic (As) stress influences nitrogen (N) transformation while application of N fertilizers during rice cropping affects As transformation. However, specific interactive effects between As and N in flooded paddy soils on As mobility and N availability were unclear. Here, we examined N and As dynamics in flooded paddy soils treated with four As levels (0, 30, 80 and 150 mg kg(-1)) and three urea additions (0, 4 and 8 mmol N kg(-1)). Arsenic contamination inhibited diazotrophs (nifH) and fungi but promoted AOA and denitrification genes (narG, nirK, nirS), decreasing dissolved organic N, NH4+-N and NO3--N. Besides, urea application stimulated As- and Fe-reducing bacteria (arrA and Geo) coupled with anammox. On Day 28, the addition of 8 mmol N kg(-1) increased total As concentrations in solutions of soils treated with 30 and 80 mg As kg(-1) by 2.4 and 1.8 times compared with the nil-N control. In contrast, at 150 mg As kg(-1), it decreased the total As concentration in soil solution by 63 % through facilitating As(III) oxidation coupled with NO3--N reduction. These results indicate that As contamination decreases N availability, but urea application affects As mobility, depending on As contamination level.

TI Graphitic carbon nitride grown in situ on aldehyde-functionalized
   α-Fe2O3: All-solid-state Z-scheme heterojunction
   for remarkable improvement of photo-oxidation activity
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Aldehyde-functionalized alpha-Fe2O3/graphitic carbon nitride (alpha-Fe2O3-DBD/g-C3N4) was successfully synthesized through Schiff-based reaction between aromatic aldehydes in 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and -NH2 groups in urea. The 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde around alpha-Fe2O3 were advantageous to in situ growth of graphitic carbon nitride on alpha-Fe2O3 to form the contact interface by chemical bonds and beneficial to the electron transfer, leading to the formation of Z-scheme photocatalytic system. The ce-Fe2O3-DBD/g-C3N4 photocatalysts exhibited a remarkable improvement in the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) compared with bulk g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the enhanced charge separation efficiency and higher redox potential. This study presents a simple and efficient method to construct all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system with the formation of tight contact interface and nonmetal materials (aromatic rings) as electron mediators for the removal of complex pollutants.

TI Sensitive Detection of Immunoglobulin G Stability Using in Real-Time
   Isothermal Differential Scanning Fluorimetry: Determinants of Protein
   Stability for Antibody-Based Therapeutics
SO TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
AB Protein instability is a major obstacle in the production and delivery of monoclonal antibody-based therapies for cancer. This study presents real-time isothermal differential scanning fluorimetry as an emerging method to evaluate the stability of human immunoglobulin G protein with high sensitivity. The stability of polyclonal human immunoglobulin G against urea-induced denaturation was assessed following: (1) oxidation by the free-radical generator 2,2-Azobis[2-amidinopropane]dihydrochloride and (2) in selected storage buffers. Significant differences in immunoglobulin G stability were detected by real-time isothermal differential scanning fluorimetry when the immunoglobulin G was stored in 1,4-Piperazinediethanesulfonic acid buffer compared to phosphate-buffered saline, with half-maximal rate of denaturation occurring at a higher urea concentration in 1,4-Piperazinediethanesulfonic acid than phosphate-buffered saline (K-nd;PIPES = 3.56 +/- 0.09 M, K-nd;PBS = 2.94 +/- 0.08 M; P < .01), but differential scanning fluorimetry did not detect differences in unfolding temperature (T-m;PIPES = 70.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C, T-m;PBS = 69.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C). The effects of 2,2-Azobis[2-amidinopropane]dihydrochloride-induced oxidation on immunoglobulin G stability were analyzed by real-time isothermal differential scanning fluorimetry; the oxidized protein showed greater sensitivity to urea (K-nd;CNTRL = 3.96 +/- 0.19 M, K-nd;AAPH = 3.49 +/- 0.07 M; P < .05). Similarly, differential scanning fluorimetry indicated greater thermal sensitivity of oxidized immunoglobulin G (T-m;CNTRL = 70.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C, T-m;AAPH = 62.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C; P < .001). However, a third method for assessing protein stability, pulse proteolysis, proved to be substantially less sensitive and did not detect significant effects of 2,2-Azobis[2-amidinopropane]dihydrochloride on the half-maximal concentration of urea needed to denature immunoglobulin G (C-m;CNTRL= 6.8 +/- 0.1 M; C-m;AAPH = 6.4 +/- 0.7 M). Overall these results demonstrate the merit of using real-time isothermal differential scanning fluorimetry as a rapid and sensitive technique for the evaluation of protein stability in solution using a quantitative real-time thermocycler.

TI Simulation of diesel exhaust aftertreatment system DOC-pipe-SCR: The
   effects of Pt loading, PtOx formation and pipe configuration
   on the deNOx performance
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB A combined exhaust aftertreatment system consisting of a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), pipe and selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (SCR) is studied in this paper by the means of mathematical modeling and simulations. Pt/gamma-Al2O3 DOC and V2O5-WO3/TiO2 SCR catalysts for heavy-duty Diesel engines are examined. First, spatially 1D models of the DOC, SCR and pipe are introduced and calibrated using the measured engine test data. The models are then employed in a simulation study of the effects of Pt loading, PtOx formation and pipe configuration on the NO2 yield in DOC and the resulting deNO(x) performance of the SCR in the driving cycles ETC and WHTC. It is shown that there exists optimum washcoat loading in the DOC with respect to NOx conversion in SCR and that the minimization of heat losses in the connecting pipe can further improve the NOx conversion. Finally, the decrease of NO oxidation activity in DOC due to PtOx formation and its impact on NOx conversion in SCR is quantified over the repeated driving cycles, showing 2-10% difference between the deNO(x) performance with the pre-reduced DOC and after few hours of operation under oxidizing conditions. Based on the simulation results, an improved configuration of the system is proposed that achieves up to 6% higher overall NOx conversion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Methanol electro oxidation on Ni-Pt-CrO/CNFs composite: morphology,
   structural, and electrochemical characterization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this work, prepared nanoparticle samples of Ni1-xCrx with a fixed ratio of platinum (3%) were synthesized and loaded onto carbon nanofibers, which were produced by an electrospinning technique and carbonized at 900 & DEG;C for 7 h in an argon atmosphere. A variety of analysis techniques were applied to examine the stoichiometry, structure, surface morphology, and electrochemical activity. The carbonization process produces carbon nanofibers decorated with metal nanoparticles. Typical fibre diameters are 250-520 nm. The fibre morphologies of the treated samples don't exhibit any overt alterations. A study of the samples' methanol electrocatalytic capabilities was conducted. Cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance measurements were used to investigate catalytic performance and electrode stability as a function of electrolyte concentration, scan rate, and reaction time. The electrooxidation reaction's activation energy is increased, and the electrode's stability is increased, when Cr is added to Ni. In sample C3, the maximum current density (JPE) was 170.3 mA/cm(2) at 0.8 V with an onset potential of 0.352 V. Utilizing our electrocatalysts, the electrooxidation of methanol involves a mix of kinetic and diffusion control limiting reactions. This study has shown how to fabricate a powerful Ni-Pt-Cr-based methanol electrooxidation catalyst using a novel approach.

SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (TM-LDHs) nanosheets are promising electrocatalysts in the renewable electrochemical energy conversion system, which are regarded as alternatives to noble metal-based materials. In this review, recent advances on effective and facile strategies to rationally design TM-LDHs nanosheets as electrocatalysts, such as increasing the number of active sties, improving the utilization of active sites (atomic-scale catalysts), modulating the electron configurations, and controlling the lattice facets, are summarized and compared. Then, the utilization of these fabricated TM-LDHs nanosheets for oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, small molecule oxidations, and biomass derivatives upgrading is articulated through systematically discussing the corresponding fundamental design principles and reaction mechanism. Finally, the existing challenges in increasing the density of catalytically active sites and future prospects of TM-LDHs nanosheets-based electrocatalysts in each application are also commented.

TI Urea-assisted one-step synthesis of cobalt ferrite impregnated ceramic
   membrane for sulfamethoxazole degradation via peroxymonosulfate
   activation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this study, a novel CoFe2O4 nanocatalyst impregnated Al2O3 ceramic membrane was prepared via a ureaassisted one-step combustion method. The catalytic membrane was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with energy dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX) and applied for the catalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation under a dead-end membrane filtration mode for the first time. Results indicate that CoFe2O4 could be impregnated into the macropores throughout the whole Al2O3 ceramic membrane via this method and the CoFe2O4 loading amount could be controlled by the multiple impregnation cycles. The membrane filtration operation mode significantly enhances the accessibility of the catalytic active sites to PMS and SMX in microreactor environment and thus the CoFe2O4 impregnated membrane displays excellent catalytic activity for the SMX degradation. The pure water permeability flux can maintain at similar to 3000 Lm(-2) h(-1) bar(-1) (LMHB) with the catalyst loading amount of 0.015 g/g Al2O3. In the membrane filtration system, the removal rate of SMX with the initial concentration of 10 mg L-1 can achieve to similar to 98%, 70% and 40% with the residence time of 90, 36 and 18 s. The catalytic membrane shows a great tolerance at wide pH range (3-11), the existence of humic acid and anions. Meanwhile, the membrane shows self-cleaning property by retaining > 90% of initial flux after 3 treatment cycles. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical quenching experiments indicate that both sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical are generated and sulfate radical is the dominant active species in the process.

TI Farrerol Attenuates Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity by Inhibiting the
   Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Oxidation, Inflammation, and Apoptotic
   Signaling Pathways
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that is often used in clinical practice, but its frequent use often leads to nephrotoxicity. Therefore, we urgently need a drug that reduces the nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin. Farrerol reportedly has antioxidant potential, but its renal protective effects and potential mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used both cell and mouse models to determine the mechanism of farrerol in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. The in vitro experiments revealed that farrerol improved cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via nuclear factor erythrocyte 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. Moreover, farrerol effectively activated Nrf2 and subsequently increased the expression of Nrf2-targeted antioxidant enzymes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), but inhibited Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and NADPH oxidase type 4 (NOX4). Furthermore, farrerol attenuated the phosphorylation of C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38); the activation of phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappa B (p-NF-kappa B) and nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3); and the expression of phosphorylated p53 (p-p53), Bax, and cleaved caspase-3. In vivo, farrerol significantly improved cisplatin-induced renal damage, as demonstrated by the recovery of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and pathological damage. Moreover, farrerol inhibited inflammatory and apoptotic protein expression in vivo. Notably, farrerol exerted slight protection in Nrf2-knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. These findings indicate that farrerol can effectively activate Nrf2 and can serve as a therapeutic target in the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI).

TI Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Parent vs. Hybrid Canola under Varying
   Nitrogen Availabilities
SO PLANTS-BASEL
AB Improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is essential for sustainable agriculture, especially in high-N-demanding crops such as canola (Brassica napus). While advancements in above-ground agronomic practices have improved NUE, research on soil and below-ground processes are limited. Plant NUE-and its components, N uptake efficiency (NUpE), and N utilization efficiency (NUtE)-can be further improved by exploring crop variety and soil N cycling. Canola parental genotypes (NAM-0 and NAM-17) and hybrids (H151857 and H151816) were grown on a dark brown chernozem in Saskatchewan, Canada. Soil and plant samples were collected at the 5-6 leaf stage and flowering, and seeds were collected at harvest maturity. Soil N cycling varied with phenotypic stage, with higher potential ammonium oxidation rates at the 5-6 leaf stage and higher urease activity at flowering. Seed N uptake was higher under higher urea-N rates, while the converse was true for NUE metrics. Hybrids had higher yield, seed N uptake, NUtE, and NUE, with higher NUE potentially owing to higher NUtE at flowering, which led to higher yield and seed N allocation. Soil N cycling and soil N concentrations correlated for improved canola NUE, revealing below-ground breeding targets. Future studies should consider multiple root characteristics, including rhizosphere microbial N cycling, root exudates, and root system architecture, to determine the below-ground dynamics of plant NUE.

TI Soil aggregate size mediates the variations in the abundance and
   function of ammonia oxidizers in heavy metal-contaminated soil under
   different nitrogen fertilization regimes
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB Mining has led to dramatic ecosystem degradation, the destruction of vegetation and irreversible damage to soil structure and nutrient cycling; additionally, heavy metal (HM) contamination has affected soil nitrogen (N) cycle-associated microorganisms and disrupted soil aggregate structure. To explore the mechanism of soil N recovery in mining areas, we investigated the effects of two N fertilizers (urea (U) and ammonium chloride (AC)) and nine different fertilization patterns on the nitrification process and ammonia oxidizers in soil aggregates via incubation experiments. The results showed that different N treatments had different influences on the distribution of AOA and AOB amoA gene abundance and microbial community structure in soil aggregates. The AOB amoA gene abundance was significantly greater than the AOA amoA gene abundance in aggregates. The dominant species of AOA and AOB were Nitrososphaera and Nitrosospira , respectively, which were mainly found in microaggregates and accounted for 10.3 % to 25.0 % and 31.5 % to 60.1 %, respectively, of the microaggregates. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) can be used as an important variable to explain variations in AOA communities, and microbial nitrogen (MBN) content, tartaric acid content, cellulase activity and AOB amoA gene abundance can be used as important variables to explain variations in AOB communities. N fertilizer addition resulted in potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) values ranging from 0.079 to 0.236, 0.100 to 0.5953 and 0.146 to 0.905 mu g.NO2--N d(-1) g(-1) in mega-, macro- and microaggregates, respectively, which suggested that PAO values increased with decreasing aggregate size. In addition, the total nitrification potential (TNP) in macroaggregates was greater than that in mega- and microaggregates, which was the main reason for the increase in the NO3 content in macroaggregates. AOB amoA gene abundance was significantly positively correlated with TNP, and AOB amoA gene abundance was more significantly positively correlated with PAO values than was AOA gene abundance, which suggests that AOB dominated ammonia oxidation and nitrification processes in aggregates. Our research contributes to an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of different types of N fertilizers on nitrification processes and ammonia oxidizers in soil aggregates and provides insights into N management in contaminated soils in mining areas.

TI Experimental characterization of enhanced SNCR process with carbonaceous
   gas additives
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Carbonaceous gases such as CO and alkanes are commonly used as additives to enhance the selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) performance due to their high reducibility. This study compared the effect of CO and CH4 on NO reduction in a tubular reactor with simulated flue gas. The enhancement of C3H8 on SNCR process was tested at extremely low temperature, i.e. 650 degrees C. Experimental results suggested that reactions between NH3 and SO2 were favored at low temperatures and the competition for NH3 between SO2 and NO was influenced by gas additives. A maximum downward shift of 25 degrees C and 109 degrees C in temperature window for 50% NO reduction efficiency was obtained with the addition of CO and CH4, respectively. Considerable CO emission was observed with addition of CH4. The addition of CH4 contributed to the formation of a self-accelerating reaction route within NO/O-2/NH3 SNCR reaction system. NO2 produced from NO accelerates the oxidation of CH4 to CO, while the oxidation of CH4 returns to enhance the NO reduction globally. Optimal NO reduction of 44% was achieved with addition of C3H8 at 650 degrees C. Substantial portion of C3H8 was partially oxidized to CO and the remaining was converted into C2H4 and C3H6 during the SNCR process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was involved. High reactivity of C3H6 and C2H4 favored the further oxidation and cracking to produce CO. These differences in oxidation behavior significantly influence the promotion capacities of CO, CH4 and C3H8 for NO reduction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rhodacydopentanones derived from carbonylative C-C activation of cyclopropyl ureas can be "captured" by pendant nucleophiles prior to "collapse" to 1,3-diazepanes. The choice of N-substituent on the cyclopropane unit controls the oxidation level of the product, such that C4-C5 unsaturated or saturated systems can be accessed selectively.

TI High anatase purity of nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanorice particles
   for the photocatalytic treatment activity of pharmaceutical wastewater
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The titanium dioxide photocatalysts modified with nitrogen (N-TiO2) were synthesized via hydrothermal method by using urea (NH2CONH2) as a nitrogen source with various concentrations of dopant. The characterizations of cooperated N-TiO2 were examined by many techniques. The performance of the synthesized N-TiO2 catalysts was evaluated by using the decomposition of ciprofloxacin under UV light irradiation. Additionally, the OH radical production was also estimated. The results revealed that the influence of different concentrations of nitrogen dopant was significant on the physicochemical and structural properties. The surface morphology exhibited the nanorice grain particles in all samples. The trend of particles size and pore diameter decreased, whereas BET surface area slightly increased with increasing of nitrogen contents. The WAXS profiles demonstrated that the photocatalysts displayed the high purity of the anatase crystalline phase and delayed the phase transformation from anatase to rutile. The bandgap energies showed lower than pure anatase crystalline phase. The types of Ti-N-O (substitutional N) and/or Ti-O-N (interstitial N) bonding were formed into TiO2 lattice investigated by XPS technique. The photodegradation of ciprofloxacin increased with increasing of nitrogen contents. The N-TiO2 catalysts can generate OH radical and in-situ OH radical thought the direct photocatalytic degradation of coumarin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Since, increasing of nitrogen content can increasingly produce OH radical to more react with organic pollutants. The de-mineralization by using the highest nitrogen content sample showed approximately 66% removal at 4 h of reaction time.

TI Reagent-adaptive active site switching on the
   IrOx/Ni(OH)2 catalyst
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB A significant challenge is to develop smart catalysts that can adapt in real time to complex reaction environments. Here, we report a bifunctional catalyst, IrOx/Ni(OH)(2) assembly, that can switch between the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) depending on the reagent coverage on the catalyst. This switch is achieved by altering the electron transfer path in the Ir-O-Ni configuration. At a critical concentration of urea, the electron transfer shifts from the Ir site to the Ni site, resulting in the switch from the OER to the UOR. This reagent-adaptive electron transfer path switching is facilitated by local charge redistribution with increasing reagent coverage. The catalyst exhibits a low onset potential of 1.42 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the OER and 1.32 V vs. RHE for the UOR, and 200 hours of stability at 10 mA cm(-2) for both the OER and UOR. This reagent-adaptive active center switching makes the catalyst useful for hydrogen production coupled with environmental purification, providing a promising approach for efficient and adaptable catalysis.

TI Oxygen Vacancies-Rich Metal Oxide for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Cycle
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The development of industry and agriculture has been accompanied by an artificially imbalanced nitrogen cycle, which threatens human health and ecological environments. Electrocatalytic systems have emerged as a sustainable way of converting nitrogen-containing molecules into high value-added chemicals. However, the construction of high-performance electrocatalysts remains challenging. The development of oxygen vacancy engineering strategy has promoted more research efforts to explore the structure-activity relationship between catalytic activity and oxygen vacancies. This review systematically summarizes the recent development of oxygen vacancies-rich metal oxides for electro-catalyzing nitrogen cycling systems, involving electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction, nitric oxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, CN coupling, urea oxidation reaction, and nitrogen oxidation reaction. First, the construction methods and characterization methods of oxygen vacancies are summarized. Then, the effect of oxygen vacancy on electrocatalytic activity of metal oxides is discussed in terms of regulating the electronic structures of electrocatalysts, improving the electroconductivity of catalysts, lowing the energy barrier, and strengthening adsorption and activation of intermediate species. Finally, future directions for oxygen vacancy engineering and electrocatalytic nitrogen cycle are anticipated.
   The applications of oxygen vacancy (Ov)-rich metal oxides in the reactions related to the electrocatalytic nitrogen cycle are reviewed, involving the nitrate reduction reaction, nitric oxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, C-N coupling reaction, urea oxidation reaction and nitrogen oxidation reaction. Ov engineering promotes the activity and stability of metal oxides by optimizing the adsorption of reactants and pivotal intermediate species.image

TI Electrochemical and thermodynamic insights on actinide type (IV) deep
   eutectic solvent
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS
AB Nuclear energy owing its low cost and being environmentally benign is considered a potential alternative to resolve global issues related to energy requirements and it mostly requires uranium dioxide as fuel. With the ssimilarintention, firstly we synthesized uranium type (IV) deep eutectic solvent (UT4D) employing uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UNH) and Urea via mechanochemical synthesis which is indeed the first report on actinide deep eutectic solvent (AnDES). The optimum mole fraction for formation of DES was found to be 0.2:0.8 for UNH: Urea respectively which was further confirmed using thermodynamic phase diagram. The formation of DES was confirmed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Various physical properties were also evaluated for UT4D such as melting point, moisture contents, viscosity, and density. Thermal studies suggested that UT4D is stable from -5.2 to 300 degrees C and there is a strong interaction parameter obtained in the present UT4D which was attributed to hydrogen bonding and the complexation of urea with UNH. Uranium ion was found to exist in U(VI) oxidation state in the form of oxo uranyl ion in UT4D. Electrochemical investigation suggested the stabilization of most unstable U(V) state by virtue of the formation of hydrogen bonded complex of uranium and urea in the DES. Further scanning the potential to more negative direction leads to reduction of U (V) ion to UO2. The optimized electrochemical parameters were further used for the electrosynthesis of UO2 nanoparticles (UDNPs) and thus offer a very green and cost-effective synthesis of UDNPs.

TI Photocatalytic Oxidation of Chlorantraniliprole, Imidacloprid,
   Pirimicarb, Thiamethoxam and Their Main Photoreaction InterMediates as
   Impacted by Water Matrix Composition under UVA-LED Exposure
SO CATALYSTS
AB Processes on wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are not always efficient for pollutant removal. A new, low-cost, and effective technology is needed. In this work, the photocatalytic degradation of four insecticides, chlorantraniliprole, imidacloprid, pirimicarb, and thiamethoxam, has been examined in different water matrices (irrigation water, leaching waters, and WWTP effluent). Lab experiments were conducted with TiO2 and ZnO, as photocatalysts, with and without Na2S2O8 as an oxidant, exposed to UVA irradiation with LED lamps. Previously, different loadings of TiO2 and ZnO were assessed on the disappearance kinetics of the different insecticides to know the optimal efficiency. The effect of water matrices, susceptible to being contaminated with the target insecticides, was discussed when the photocatalytic system TiO2/Na2S2O8 was applied. The abatement of their main transformation products (TPs) was also monitored during the studied photoperiods. A total of 13 TPs were detected in the different water matrices studied. All of them were formed and eliminated during the photoperiod, except thiamethoxam urea which was present from the beginning of the experiments due to its hydrolysis in water. In conclusion, UVA-LED lamps are a good source to carry out heterogeneous photocatalysis in WWTP, since its high efficiency, low-cost, long lifetime, and effectiveness on pollutant removal.

TI Transition metal-based self-supported anode for electrocatalytic water
   splitting at a large current density
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Hydrogen produced from water electrolysis is a promising alternative to fossil fuels. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which occurs at the anode, involves a four-electron transfer process and requires a large potential to overcome the energy barrier. To address this challenge and reduce the cost associated with noble-metal catalysts, transition metal (TM) based catalysts offer a cost-effective solution. Compared to powder catalysts, TM-based catalysts in situ grown on conductive substrates are more suitable for industrial hydrogen production at large current density. Additionally, oxidation reactions with lower thermodynamic potential than OER have been explored as alternatives to reduce power consumption in electrohydrolysis hydrogen production. In this review, we provide an overview of the evaluation criterion, selection of substrate, preparation methods for selfsupporting catalysts and their respective advantages and disadvantages. We also discuss the principle of active site selection and various strategies for enhancing the activity of catalysts, including metal doping, heteroatom doping, co-doping of both, heterojunctions, amorphization, compositing with conductive materials, morphology engineering, and creating superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface. We then examine alternative anode reactions, such as urea oxidation, hydrazine oxidation, glucose oxidation and alcohol oxidation reactions. Finally, we outline the current challenges in the design of electrocatalysts and anodic oxidation reactions and provide an outlook on the future of hydrogen production using TM-based self-supported electrocatalysts.

TI Temperature alters dicyandiamide (DCD) efficacy for multiple reactive
   nitrogen species in urea-amended soils: Experiments and modeling
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Dicyandiamide (DCD) is a nitrification inhibitor (NI) used to reduce reactive nitrogen (N) losses from soils. While commonly used, its effectiveness varies widely. Few studies have measured DCD and temperature effects on a complete set of soil N variables, including nitrite (NO2-) measured separately from nitrate (NO3-). Here the DCD reduction efficiencies (RE) for nine N availability metrics were quantified in two soils (a loam and silt loam) using aerobic laboratory microcosms at 5-30 degrees C. Both regression analysis and process modeling were used to characterize the responses. Four metrics accounted for NO3- production and included total mobilized N, net nitrification, maximum nitrification rate, and cumulative NO3- (cNO(3)(-)). The REs for these NO3--associated production variables decreased linearly with temperature, and in all cases were below 60% at temperatures >= 22 degrees C, except for cNO(3)(-) in one soil. In contrast, REs for NO2- and nitric oxide (NO) gas production were less sensitive to temperature, ranging from 80 to 99% at 22 degrees C and 50-95% at 30 degrees C. Addition of DCD suppressed nitrous oxide (N2O) production in both soils by 20-80%, but increased ammonia volatilization by 36-210%. The time at which the maximum reduction efficiency occurred decreased exponentially with increasing temperature for most variables. The two-step nitrification process model (2SN) was modified to include competitive inhibition coupled to first-order DCD decomposition. Model versus data comparisons suggested that DCD had indirect effects on NO2- kinetics that contributed to the greater suppression of NO2- and NO relative to NO3-. This study also points to the need for NIs that are more stable under increased temperature. The methods used here could help to assess the efficacy and temperature sensitivity of other NIs as well as new microbial inhibitors that may be developed.

AB An electrochemical cyclization reaction of easily available urea-tethered diynes has been developed for the synthesis of nitrogen doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The employment of ferrocene as a mild and selective redox catalyst allows access to a variety of electron-rich PAHs including helicene-like structures without overoxidation. The electrosynthetic method involves an unprecedented amidyl radical cascade cyclization process to form three rings in a single operation.

TI Inborn Errors of Metabolism
SO CLINICS IN PERINATOLOGY
AB Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are individually rare but collectively common. Approximately 25% of IEMs can have manifestations in the neonatal period. Neonates with IEM are usually healthy at birth; however, in hours to days after birth they can develop nonspecific signs that are common to several other neonatal conditions. Therefore, maintaining a high index of suspicion is extremely important for early diagnosis and the institution of appropriate therapy, which are mandatory to prevent death and ameliorate complications from many IEMs.

TI Starch of oat derived nanostructured Fe/Mn bimetallic carbon materials
   for sulfamethoxazole degradation via peroxymonosulfate activation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Fe/Mn bimetallic carbon materials were synthesized by combining oat and urea, followed by and carbonization processes, the activity and mechanism of the obtained materials in activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation were determined. Data suggested that the obtained material (CN@FeMn10-800) showed the optimal performance for SMX degradation under the1:8:0.05:0.05 mass ratios of oat/urea/ Fe/Mn. Around 91.2 % SMX (10 mg L-1) was removed under the conditions of 0.15 g L-1 CN@FeMn-10-800 and 0.20 g L-1 PMS. The CN@FeMn-10-800 showed great adaptability under different conditions, satisfactory activation repeatability and versatility. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that core-shell structure with rich porous of CN@FeMn-10-800 was achieved. Quenching test and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) indicated that surface bound oxygen and singlet oxygen (1O2) were the dominate reactive groups in this system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggested that graphite N, Fe0, Fe3C and Mn(II) were the dominant active sites. Through the work, a simple strategy could be found to make high-value use of biomass and use it to effectively purified wastewater.

TI Structure-Property Relationships in Redox-Derivatized

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) junctions based on n-Si have proven to be effective electrodes in terms of electrocatalysis activity and durability for performing photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Here, we show that the modification of n-Si MIS systems with CoFe Prussian blue (CoFePB) and NiRu Prussian blue (NiRuPB) analogues can modify their properties and allow a direct probing of the interfacial energetics through their redox feature. Our investigations demonstrate the importance of the preparation route and attribute the large upward photovoltage variation found in n-Si/SiOx/Ni/NiRuPB to the increasing inhomogeneity of the metal thin film. Finally, the optimal photoanode was tested for oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions. Our findings provide important insights on MIS photoanodes for future development in the field of solar fuel production.

   CoFe2O4 anode material for lithium ion battery
   applications
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Mesoporous CoFe2O4 and lanthanum ion (La3+) substituted CoFe2O4 nanoparticles of composition CoLa0.06Fe1.94O4 were prepared by the citric acid and urea assisted combustion process and the citric acid, urea, and glycerol assisted foam combustion process, respectively. The effect of lanthanum ion substitution on the crystallite size, the lattice parameter, the particle morphology and electrical properties of pristine CoFe2O4 is studied using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and impedance spectroscopy. For electrochemical studies, half cells are fabricated in CR 2032 coin cells using mesoporous CoFe2O4 and CoLa0.06Fe1.94O4 as anode materials. The charge/discharge performances of half cells are studied using cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge cycling. The rare earth ion substitution improved the structural stability of pristine CoFe2O4 and enhanced the oxidation reaction which maintained the number of lithium ions involved in the oxidation and reduction reactions. It also improved the battery performance, for instance, the specific capacity of La3+-ion doped CoFe2O4 is 188% compared to the pristine CoFe2O4 anode even after 50 cycles.

TI Noncatalytic Antioxidant Role for Helicobacter pylori Urease
SO JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY
AB The well-studied catalytic role of urease, the Ni-dependent conversion of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia, has been shown to protect Helicobacter pylori against the low pH environment of the stomach lumen. We hypothesized that the abundantly expressed urease protein can play another noncatalytic role in combating oxidative stress via Met residue-mediated quenching of harmful oxidants. Three catalytically inactive urease mutant strains were constructed by single substitutions of Ni binding residues. The mutant versions synthesize normal levels of urease, and the altered versions retained all methionine residues. The three site-directed urease mutants were able to better withstand a hypochlorous acid (HOCI) challenge than a Delta ureAB deletion strain. The capacity of purified urease to protect whole cells via oxidant quenching was assessed by adding urease enzyme to non-growing HOCI-exposed cells. No wild-type cells were recovered with oxidant alone, whereas urease addition significantly aided viability. These results suggest that urease can protect H. pylori against oxidative damage and that the protective ability is distinct from the well-characterized catalytic role. To determine the capability of methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) to reduce oxidized Met residues in urease, purified H. pylori urease was exposed to HOCI and a previously described Msr peptide repair mixture was added. Of the 25 methionine residues in urease, 11 were subject to both oxidation and to Msr-mediated repair, as identified by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis; therefore, the oxidant-quenchable Met pool comprising urease can be recycled by the Msr repair system. Noncatalytic urease appears to play an important role in oxidant protection.
   IMPORTANCE Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection can lead to gastric ulcers and gastric cancers. The enzyme urease contributes to the survival of the bacterium in the harsh environment of the stomach by increasing the local pH. In addition to combating acid, H. pylori must survive host-produced reactive oxygen species to persist in the gastric mucosa. We describe a cyclic amino acid-based antioxidant role of urease, whereby oxidized methionine residues can be recycled by methionine sulfoxide reductase to again quench oxidants. This work expands our understanding of the role of an already acknowledged pathogen virulence factor and specifically expands our knowledge of H. pylori survival mechanisms.

AB Cellulose, which accounts for more than half of the carbon content in plants, has become a popular feedstock for biofuel production. In this work, direct electricity generation from dissolved cellulosic biomass in an alkaline fuel cell is explored without energy-intensive process. The effect of different cellulose dissolution solvents on the electricity production is investigated. Results show dissolution treatment can remarkably affect the fuel cell performance. When NaOH/urea/thiourea is chosen as a solvent, the specific capacity of cellulose is about sixfold higher than that using only NaOH as solvent. The limiting current density and themaximum power density reach 0.85 mA cm(-2) and 0.07mW cm(-2), respectively. This power density surpasses those of any existing biotic or abiotic designs. Electrochemical characterizations demonstrate that the remarkable activity improvement towards the cellulose oxidation reaction in NaOH/urea/thiourea aqueous solution is due to the lower charger transfer resistance and higher energy transfer efficiency.

TI Phytochemicals of mustard (Brassica Campestris) leaves tuned the
   nickel-cobalt bimetallic oxide properties for enzyme-free sensing of
   glucose
SO JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The fabrication of enzyme-free glucose sensors is highly demanded for the biological, clinical, and food applications. In this study, we have developed a green method for tuning the surface properties of nickel-cobalt bimetallic oxide (NiCo2O4) by adding mustard (Brassica Campestris) leaves extract during hydrothermal growth. The mustard (Brassica Campestris) leaves extract is rich with a variety of phytochemicals, which can easily tune the surface properties of NiCo2O4 nanostructures, thereby paving the way toward the development of sensitive and selective non-enzymatic glucose sensors. The effect of various amounts of mustard (Brassica Campestris) leaves extract (0-20 ml) was also studied to find out the optimal conditions for growing surface-modified NiCo2O4 nanostructures. The morphology and crystalline structure of the nanomaterials were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, respectively. The presence of an increasing quantity of mustard (Brassica Campestris) extract keeps the crystalline structure and the morphology of the NiCo2O4 nanostructures unaltered but changes their dimensions. All nanostructures show the same cubic spinel structure of NiCo2O4 and a morphology of spherical urchins composed of nanorods, but the diameter of the urchins decreases from similar to 10 mu m to several nanometers, thus increasing the surface area of the nanomaterial. Furthermore, NiCo2O4 nanostructures were deposited onto glassy carbon electrodes (CGE), showing excellent catalytic properties toward the enzyme-free detection of glucose using cyclic voltammetry. Importantly, the intensity of the oxidation current peak was linear over a wide range of glucose concentrations (from 0.1 to 10 mM) and the limit of detection (LOD) was estimated around 0.001 mM. Additionally, NiCo2O4 nanostructures grown in the presence of 20 ml of mustard leaf extract demonstrated good repeatability and excellent selectivity for glucose, without interference by other components such as urea, lactic acid, uric acid, ascorbic acid, as well as potassium and sodium ions. The combined results attest that mustard leaf extract has high potential as a green approach to improve the electrochemical properties of nanostructured materials, and could be useful for a wide range of materials for future electrochemical applications.

TI Visible-light-driven N2-g-C3N4 as a
   highly stable and efficient photocatalyst for bisphenol A and Cr(VI)
   removal in binary systems
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB Proper design and preparation of photocatalyst with higher stability, higher activity and lower cost is still a significant objective. It is critical to know how it works. In this work, N-2-g-C3N4 was fabricated via a facile approach for the oxidation of bisphenol A (BPA) and reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) synchronically in BPA/Cr(VI) binary systems under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm). The resulting N-2-g-C3N4 performed much higher removal efficiency in binary systems than in single system owing to the synergistic effect between BPA oxidation and Cr(VI) reduction. Moreover, the free-radical quenching experiments and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation in different dispersions were performed to research the mechanism, and the results suggested that Cr(VI) can be reduced to Cr(III) by the generated H2O2 and conduction band (CB) electrons. O-2(center dot) - radicals dominated BPA degradation and derived mainly from the reaction between CB electrons and adsorbed oxygen as well as interaction of Cr(VI) and H2O2, which was verified by electron spin resonance (ESR) active species trapping experiments. These results of BPA oxidation and Cr(VI) reduction in binary systems and the corresponding reaction mechanism analysis might consolidate the fundamental theories of photocatalytic reactions for real environmental pollution cleanup applications.

TI Outstanding catalytic performance of metal-free peroxymonosulfate
   activator: Important role of chrysotile
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB A metal-free peroxymonosulfate catalyst based on chrysotile and graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesized for the first time. The abundant hydroxyl groups of chrysotile can react with amine groups of urea-derived intermediates and accelerate formation of double nitrogen defects (N-vacancy and cyano group) in g-C3N4, which can drastically improve the activation efficiency of PMS. The introdution of chrysotile can greatly increase the reaction time of hydroxyl and amine groups, and promote the generation of double nitrogen defects. This catalyst displayed superior catalytic performance for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation than bare chrysotile and g-C3N4. Moverover, this catalyst also has good cycle performance, structural stability and universal applicability, which provides an idea for the comprehensive utilization of asbestos tailings and environmental remediation.

TI Copper-Catalyzed Intramolecular Oxidative Amination of Unactivated
   Internal Alkenes
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB A copper-catalyzed oxidative amination of unactivated internal alkenes has been developed. The Wacker-type oxidative alkene amination reaction is traditionally catalyzed by a palladium through a mechanism involving aminopalladation and -hydride elimination. Replacing the precious and scarce palladium with a cheap and abundant copper for this transformation has been challenging because of the difficulty associated with the aminocupration of internal alkenes. The combination of a simple copper salt, without additional ligand, as the catalyst and Dess-Martin periodinane as the oxidant, promotes efficiently the oxidative amination of allylic carbamates and ureas bearing di- and trisubstituted alkenes leading to oxazolidinones and imidazolidinones. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested a hybrid radical-organometallic mechanism involving an amidyl radical cyclization to form the key C-N bond.

SO LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB A new type of nitrogen and chloride co-doped carbon dots (N/Cl-CDs) based on choline chloride-urea-glycine ternary deep eutectic solvents (DESs) was synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal method. The prepared N/Cl-CDs exhibited oxidase-like activity and excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The addition of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) (i.e. N/Cl-CDs + Ag NPs) to the N/Cl-CDs also significantly enhanced the oxidase and antibacterial activities. The nanocomposite (1 center dot 8 mg ml(-1)) completely inactivated 10(5) CFU per ml of MRSA in 90 min. E. coli and S. aureus were labelled with the N/Cl-CDs, enabling multicolour fluorescence imaging at different excitation wavelengths. The nanocomposites have high antibacterial efficiency as a new bactericidal agent, as well as application potential with good biocompatibility and low toxicity.

   via a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Magnetic deep eutectic solvents (MDESs) are adjuvants and an emerging subclass of heterogeneous catalysts in organic transformations. Herein, choline chloride (Ch/Cl) embedded on naphthalene bis-urea-supported magnetic nanoparticles, namely, Fe3O4@SiO2@DES1, was constructed by a special approach. This compound was scrutinized and characterized by instrumental techniques such as FTIR, thermogravimetry and derivative thermogravimetry (TGA/DTG), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), elemental mapping, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. Potential catalytic activity of Fe3O4@SiO2@DES1 was impressive, facilitating the synthesis of new 1,2,3-triazole-nicotinonitrile hybrids via a multicomponent method with 65-98% yields. Enhanced rates, high yields, mild reaction conditions, and recycling and reusability of Fe3O4@SiO2@DES1 are the distinct benefits of this catalytic organic synthetic methodology.

TI A 4H+/4e-Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffer Based on a Mononuclear Cu
   Complex
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB In this research article, we describe a 4H(+)/4e(-) electron-coupled-proton buffer (ECPB) based on Cu and a redox-active ligand. The protonated/reduced ECPB (complex 1: [Cu(8H(+)/14e(-))]1+), consisting of CuI with 2 equiv of the ligand ((LH4)-L-cat: 1,1 '-(4,5-dimethoxy-1, 2-p henylene)b is (3-(tert-butyl)-urea)), reacted with H+/e(-) acceptors such as O-2 to generate the deprotonated/oxidized ECPB. The resulting compound, (complex 5: [Cu(4H(+)/10e(-))](1+)), was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR), and density functional theory, and it is electronically described as a cuprous bis(benzoquinonediimine) species. The stoichiometric 4H(+)/4e(- )reduction of 5 was carried out with H+/e(-) donors to generate 1 (CuI and 2 equiv of (LH4)-L-cat) and the corresponding oxidation products. The 1/5 ECPB system catalyzed the 4H(+)/4e(-) reduction of O-2 to H2O and the dehydrogenation of organic substrates in a decoupled (oxidations and reductions are separated in time and space) and a coupled fashion (oxidations and reductions coincide in time and space). Mechanistic analysis revealed that upon reductive protonation of 5 and oxidative deprotonation of 1, fast disproportionation reactions regenerate complexes 5 and 1 in a stoichiometric fashion to maintain the ECPB equilibrium.

TI Eriocitrin prevents Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury through
   anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation via modulating Nrf2/DRP1/OPA1
   signaling pathway
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENERAL SUBJECTS
AB Background: Severe inflammation and oxidative stress are characteristics of sepsis -associated kidney injury with high morbidity and mortality. Eriocitrin (ERI) has shown promise in suppressing sepsis -associated kidney injury and LPS-induced periodontal disease, however, its efficacy in alleviating SAKI remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of ERI on SAKI through in vivo and in vitro experiments, elucidating its underlying mechanism. Methods: The therapeutic effects of ERI against SAKI were evaluated by survival rate, changes of serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and statistic of renal histological score in a Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic mice. Impactions about anti -coagulation, anti -inflammation, anti -oxidative stress and improvement of mitochondrial damage and mitochondrial morphology were further assayed. In vitro, HUVECs upon stimulation of LPS with or without different dosage of ERI, followed by evaluating changes in inflammation, mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium and signaling pathways. Results: ERI demonstrated ameliorative effects on SAKI by attenuating inflammation, oxidative stress and coagulation evidenced by the improved survival rate, alleviated kidney histological injury, declined BUN and Scr in serum and diminished levels of inflammation cytokines, and coagulation factors. Mechanistically, ERI suppressed DRP1-regulated mitochondrial fission and promoted OPA1-modulated mitochondrial fusion by activating Nrf2 in septic mice and LPS-stimulated HUVECs, which maintained mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium, improved mitochondrial morphology, assured integrity of mitochondrial function, decreased oxidative stress, impeded overwhelming inflammation, and thus, played a pivotal role in ERI 's protection against SAKI. Conclusion: Our data confirmed the therapeutic potential of ERI in mitigating SAKI ,suggesting its viability as a pharmacological agent in clinic settings.

TI Use of carbon paste electrodes as a novel strategy to study adsorption
   mechanism of silver ions onto functionalized grapefruit peel
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In order to study the adsorption mechanism of silver ions onto adsorbents prepared from grapefruit pee' functionalized with urea and melamine, carbon paste electrodes (CPE) were prepared and cyclic voltammetr studies were carried out. The electrochemical results showed that for the case of CPE containing the adsorber functionalized with urea, there is one oxidation signal at 0.0 V vs. MSE attributable to the oxidation of silver thi was adsorbed onto the amino groups present on its surface. On the other hand, in the CPE that contained th adsorbent functionalized with melamine, two oxidation signals were observed at 0.0 V and 0.1 V vs. MS attributable to silver adsorbed to the surface, but indicating the presence of two different energy adsorption site: The first of them associated with amino groups and the second with carboxyl groups. The results were con plemented with infrared spectroscopy techniques, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and dispersive energ spectroscopy and immersion microcalorimetry. From the results obtained it was possible to define the nu chanism of adsorption of the metal on each of the adsorbents studied. The electrochemical study has provide valuable information to elucidate the mechanism of adsorption, adequately complemented with conventions spectroscopic techniques has achieved a broad characterization of the amino-functionalized organic matrix, s that this analytical technique is shown as a new alternative to study superficial chemical changes in functic nalized materials.

TI Fate of low molecular weight organic matters in reverse osmosis and
   vacuum ultraviolet process for high-quality ultrapure water production
   in the semiconductor industry
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Ultrapure water (UPW) is essential in the semiconductor industry for rinsing and cleaning products. With the growing demand for UPW, various feed water sources such as tap water, surface water, and wastewater are utilized to produce UPW. However, these feed water sources contain various low molecular weight organic matters (LMWOMs), which can adversely affect the quality of semiconductors when present in treated UPW. Therefore, achieving the complete removal of LMWOMs is crucial in the UPW production process. However, the current reverse osmosis (RO) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) processes employed for UPW production have limitations in achieving complete LMWOM removal. Therefore, this study is conducted to investigate the mechanisms of LMWOM removal in RO and the performance of VUV for high-quality UPW production. Six LMWOMs found in the semiconductor industry were tested for lab- and pilot-scale experiments. The result showed that size exclusion is the main mechanism of LMWOM removal in the RO process. However, methanol, ethanol, and urea were not efficiently removed by RO membranes. In addition, a lab-scale VUV experiment was performed under accelerated conditions to examine the oxidation mechanism of LMWOM. The LMWOM with low reactivity to hydroxyl radicals, such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and urea, were not removed perfectly within 60 min and 180 min, respectively. Furthermore, a pilot-scale VUV experiment was performed to examine the oxidation of LMWOM under real UPW production conditions. Despite observing a correlation in the pseudo-first-order rate constants between the lab-scale and pilot-scale experiments, the removal of TMAH and urea was still not achieved even with a lamp power of 320 W. As urea was not completely removed by either RO or VUV, strategies for UPW production using current water sources are discussed to develop future UPW technologies.

TI Preparation of HfCxN1-x Nanoparticles Derived from
   a Multifunction Precursor with Hf-O and Hf-N Bonds
SO MATERIALS
AB HfCxN1-x nanoparticles were synthesized using the urea-glass route, employing hafnium chloride, urea, and methanol as raw materials. The synthesis process, polymer-to-ceramic conversion, microstructure, and phase evolution of HfCxN1-x/C nanoparticles were thoroughly investigated across a wide range of molar ratios between the nitrogen source and the hafnium source. Upon annealing at 1600 & DEG;C, all precursors demonstrated remarkable translatability to HfCxN1-x ceramics. Under high nitrogen source ratios, the precursor exhibited complete transformation into HfCxN1-x nanoparticles at 1200 & DEG;C, with no observed presence of oxidation phases. In comparison to HfO2, the carbothermal reaction of HfN with C significantly reduced the preparation temperature required for HfC. By increasing the urea content in the precursor, the carbon content of the pyrolyzed products increased, leading to a substantial decrease in the electrical conductivity of HfCxN1-x/C nanoparticle powders. Notably, as the urea content in the precursor increased, a significant decrease in average electrical conductivity values was observed for the R4-1600, R8-1600, R12-1600, and R16-1600 nanoparticles measured at a pressure of 18 MPa, yielding values of 225.5, 59.1, 44.8, and 46.0 S & BULL;cm(-1), respectively.

TI Engineering cobalt molybdate nanosheet arrays with phosphorus-modified
   nickel as heterogeneous electrodes for highly-active energy-saving water
   splitting
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Electrochemical urea electrolysis has been regarded as a promising strategy to replace traditional water -splitting technology to achieve hydrogen fuel due to its cost savings and high energy efficiency. Designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts easily is important but still faces significant challenges. Herein, an interface engineering strategy is used to construct a hybrid material by coupling cobalt molybdate (CoMoO4) nanosheet arrays with phosphorus-modified nickel (P-Ni) particles on copper foam (P-Ni@CoMoO4/CF) through the hydrothermal and in-situ electrodeposition process. Benefiting from the abundant catalytic active sites, low charge transfer resistance, and synergistic coupling effect, the optimal P-Ni@CoMoO4/CF electrocatalyst presents a superior bifunctional activity for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In detail, a small overpotential of 125 mV and a low poten-tial of 1.36 V is required to attain the current density of 100 mA cm-2 for HER and UOR, respectively. In the process of urea electrolysis, the P-Ni@CoMoO4/CF-based electrolyzer provides a current density of 100 mA cm-2 with an overall voltage of 1.50 V, about 170 mV less than that in a traditional water electrolyzer. The high performance of P-Ni@CoMoO4/CF outperforms many recently reported electrodes, suggesting its promising application in energy-saving hydrogen production. Our work proposes a novel idea for the rational design and exploitation of low-cost and robust bifunctional electrodes for electrocatalysis.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI CuCo2O4 based economical electrochemical sensor
   for the nanomolar detection of hydrazine and metol
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Nanocrystalline CuCo2O4 was synthesized in the presence of ammonium fluoride and urea. Material was characterized by the complementary combination of X-ray diffraction, N-2-adsorption, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, field enhanced scanning electron microscopic and transmission electron microscopic techniques. Electrochemical sensor based on CuCo2O4 was developed for the detection of organic water pollutants hydrazine and metol. For the comparative purpose, CuO and Co3O4 were synthesized and electrochemical sensors based on these materials were evaluated under the identical condition. CuCo2O4 exhibited excellent electro catalytic activity, stability, sensitivity, and selectivity in the detection of these organic pollutants. Under the optimum condition, a wide linear range was obtained from 32 nM-5000 mu M and 20 nM-1000 mu M with a limit of detection of 8 nM and 6 nM for hydrazine and metol, respectively at economical CuCo2O4 modified electrode. The analytical performance of the developed sensor was demonstrated in the determination of hydrazine and metol in different real samples such as river water, tap water and metol in photographic solution with satisfactory results.

TI Nitrogen Doped Graphene Generated by Microwave Plasma and Reduction
   Expansion Synthesis
SO NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB This work aimed to produce nitrogen doped graphene from Graphite Oxide (GO) by combining the Expansion Reduction Synthesis (RES) approach, which utilizes urea as doping/reducing agent, with the use of an Atmospheric Plasma torch (Plasma), which provides the high temperature reactor environment known to thermally exfoliate it. The use of this combined strategy (Plasma-RES) was tried in an attempt to increase the surface area of the products. The amount of nitrogen doping was controlled by varying the urea/GO mass ratios in the precursor powders. X-ray diffraction analysis, SEM, TEM, BET surface areas and conductivity measurements of the diverse products are presented. Nitrogen inclusion in the graphene samples was corroborated by the mass spectral signal of the evolved gases generated during thermal programmed oxidation experiments of the products and by EDX analysis. We found that the Plasma-RES method can successfully generate doped graphene in situ as the urea and GO precursors simultaneously decompose and reduce in the discharge zone. When using the same amount of urea in the precursor mixture, samples obtained in Plasma-RES have higher surface area than those generated by RES, however they contain a smaller nitrogen content.

Results point out that electrolytic technology can mineralize all organic contained in the urine very efficiently and that oxidation of the two pharmaceuticals is faster than that of the natural products contained in urine, opening the possibility of a selective treatment of the urine up to the point in which it can be merged safely with domestic wastewater without generating a negative impact on environment. Occurrence of perchlorate is the main drawback of this technology, although its impact is not believed to be as serious as the impact of the pharmaceuticals on environment.

TI Easy Preparation, High Water Resistance Glucose-Based
   Environment-Friendly Wood Adhesives
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Recently, formaldehyde-free environment-friendly bio-based wood adhesives have been a hot research topic in the wood industry. Glucose is a widely sourced biomass material, presenting also good reactivity, which has made it a focus of cutting-edge research. In the work presented here, a new formulation was developed for preparing a glucose-based biomass adhesive with excellent bonding strength and water resistance. Glucose was oxidized by sodium periodate at room temperature to generate bioaldehydes (OG), which were then reacted with a polyurea (HU) synthesized by reaction of hexamethylene diamine (HMD) with urea (U) via deamination. This resulted in an environmentally friendly green glucose-based adhesive (OGHU resin) containing neither formaldehyde nor other toxic volatile aldehydes. The effect of the mass ratio of HU/OG on the resin properties was investigated. The results showed that the OGHU resin imparted to the plywood bonded with excellent bonding strength and water resistance. The dry shear strength, 24 h cold water soaking wet strength, 3 h hot water (63 degrees C) wet strength, and 3 h boiling water wet strength were as high as 1.48 1.16, 1.26, and 1.12 MPa, respectively. Its superior bonding performance exceeded the expectations of the GB/T 9846-2015 standard (>= 0.7 MPa) sufficiently to be considered as a substitute for the currently used urea-formaldehyde wood panel adhesives.

TI Hydrate catalysts enabled the self-reconstruction of NiMoO4
   for efficient water oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Transition metal-based pre-catalysts undergo drastic reconstruction to form active catalysts during the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. However, little is known about how pre-catalysts affect the activity of the in situ generated active species. Herein, the reconstruction degree is modulated by varying hydrate/anhydrous molybdate pre-catalysts, which will reveal the effects of pre-catalysts in the OER activity. The hydrate molybdate not only presents a faster reconstruction rate but also outstanding OER activity and stability, and exhibits a low overpotential of only 206 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution. Experimental investigations reveal that the oxide hydroxides/hydroxyls derived from hydrates exhibit a larger surface area, and a higher concentration of OH- on the surface, which accelerates the OER kinetics rate. Furthermore, the lattice oxygen was triggered and therefore able to react via a faster lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) pathway, which presents lower thermodynamic barriers compared to catalysts derived from anhydrous pre-catalysts. This work may provide new insight into elucidating the OER activity enhancement mechanism.

TI Cost-Efficient Graphitic Carbon Nitride as an Effective Photocatalyst
   for Antibiotic Degradation: An Insight into the Effects of Different
   Precursors and Coexisting Ions, and Photocatalytic Mechanism
SO CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL
AB In this study, the photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) synthesized via different precursors (urea, thiourea, and dicyandiamide) is investigated in the degradation process of tetracycline. Owing to the efficient charge separation and transfer, prolonged radiative lifetime of charge, large surface area, and nanosheet morphology, the urea-derived g-C3N4 exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for tetracycline degradation under visible-light irradiation. This performance can compare with that of most reported g-C3N4-based composite photocatalysts. Through the time-circle degradation experiment, the urea-derived g-C3N4 is found to have an excellent photocatalytic stability. The presence of NO3-, CH3COO-, Cl- and SO42- ions with the concentration of 10 mm inhibits the photocatalytic activity of urea-derived g-C3N4, where this inhibitory effect is more obvious for Cl- and SO42- ions. For the coexisting Cu2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ ions, the Cu2+ ion exhibits a significantly higher inhibitory effect than Ca2+ and Zn2+ ions for tetracycline degradation. However, both the inhibitory and facilitating effects are observed in the presence of Fe3+ ion with different concentration. The h(+), (OH)-O-. and O-.(2)- radicals are confirmed as major oxidation species and a possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed in a urea-derived g-C3N4 reaction system. This study is of important significance to promote the large-scale application of g-C3N4 photocatalysts in antibiotic wastewater purification.

TI Long-term N-addition alters the community structure of functionally
   important N-cycling soil microorganisms across global grasslands
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) input is known to alter the soil microbiome, but how N enrichment influences the abundance, alpha-diversity and community structure of N-cycling functional microbial communities in grass-lands remains poorly understood. Here, we collected soils from plant communities subjected to up to 9 years of annual N-addition (10 g N m(-2) per year using urea as a N-source) and from unfertilized plots (control) in 30 grasslands worldwide spanning a large range of climatic and soil conditions. We focused on three key microbial groups responsible for two essential processes of the global N cycle: N-2 fixation (soil diazotrophs) and nitrification (AOA: ammonia-oxidizing archaea and AOB: ammonia-oxidizing bacteria). We targeted soil diazotrophs, AOA and AOB using Illumina MiSeq sequencing and measured the abundance (gene copy numbers) using quantitative PCR. N-addition shifted the structure of the diazotrophic communities, although their alphadiversity and abundance were not affected. AOA and AOB responded differently to N-addition. The abundance and alpha-diversity of AOB increased, and their community structure shifted with N-addition. In contrast, AOA were not affected by N-addition. AOA abundance outnumbered AOB in control plots under conditions of low N availability, whereas N-addition favoured copiotrophic AOB. Overall, N-addition showed a low impact on soil diazotrophs and AOA while effects for AOB communities were considerable. These results reveal that long-term N-addition has important ecological implications for key microbial groups involved in two critical soil N-cycling processes. Increased AOB abundance and community shifts following N-addition may change soil N-cycling, as larger population sizes may promote higher rates of ammonia oxidation and subsequently increase N loss via gaseous and soil N-leaching. These findings bring us a step closer to predicting the responses and feedbacks of microbial-mediated N-cycling processes to long-term anthropogenic N-addition in grasslands.

TI Influence of carbonate-inducing bacteria on desulfurization effect of
   medium and high sulfur coal gangue under spraying and preparation of
   desulfurized coal gangue mortar
SO CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS
AB Medium and high sulfur coal gangue (MHSCG) presents challenges for safe application on civil engineering building materials due to the high content of unstable pyrite, of which the acidic oxidation products are against alkali cementitious materials. For better utilization of MHSCG, in this research, the carbonate-inducing bacterium Sporosarcina Pasteurii with its nutrient (urea) and mineralization source (calcium) was firstly explored in MHSCG desulfurization leaching tests, revealing the mechanism of desulfurization. On this basis, the desulfurizing modification on MHSCG sand by the bacteria under different factors of OD600, urea and calcium was conducted. Moreover, the gangue sand was used to prepare the desulfurized coal gangue mortar (DCGM) and the relevant mechanical properties and influence mechanisms were discussed. The results of total sulfur and XRD analysis show that Sporosarcina Pasteurii can accelerate the desulfurization in the 7-days-spraying modification. When the optimum dosages of OD600 (0.84) and urea solution concentration (1.41 mol/L) are adopted, the total sulfur can be reduced by 33.66 similar to 36.32 %. The total sulfur has been further reduced by 7.69 % compared with group without calcium as calcium concentration is 1.56 mol/L. The introduction of calcium can enhance the mechanical properties of MHSCG and DCGM although the desulfurization treatment has a negative impact on them. The crushing index of MHSCG sand at most decreases 10.44 % from it without calcium. When OD600 is about 0.90, urea concentration is about 1.50 mol/L and calcium concentration is about 1.49 mol/L, the 28-d compressive strength of DCGM increases to 32.01 MPa, 76.85 % higher than group without calcium, and 23.54 % higher than raw-material preparing mortar.

TI Beneficial Effect of Cuban Policosanol on Blood Pressure and Serum
   Lipoproteins Accompanied with Lowered Glycated Hemoglobin and Enhanced
   High-Density Lipoprotein Functionalities in a Randomized,
   Placebo-Controlled, and Double-Blinded Trial with Healthy Japanese
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 20 mg of Cuban policosanol in blood pressure (BP) and lipid/lipoprotein parameters of healthy Japanese subjects via a placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blinded human trial. After 12 weeks of consumption, the policosanol group showed significantly lower BP, glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The policosanol group also showed lower aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GTP) levels at week 12 than those at week 0: A decrease of up to 9% (p < 0.05), 17% (p < 0.05), and 15% (p < 0.05) was observed, respectively. The policosanol group showed significantly higher HDL-C level and HDL-C/TC (%), approximately 9.5% (p < 0.001) and 7.2% (p = 0.003), respectively, than the placebo group and a difference in the point of time and group interaction (p < 0.001). In lipoprotein analysis, the policosanol group showed a decrease in oxidation and glycation extent in VLDL and LDL with an improvement of particle shape and morphology after 12 weeks. HDL from the policosanol group showed in vitro stronger antioxidant and in vivo anti-inflammatory abilities. In conclusion, 12 weeks of Cuban policosanolconsumption in Japanese subjects showed significant improvement in blood pressure, lipid profiles, hepatic functions, and HbA(1c) with enhancement of HDL functionalities.

TI Nitrapyrin reduced ammonia oxidation with different impacts on the
   abundance of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidisers in four
   agricultural soils
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB The compound nitrapyrin can act as a potential nitrification inhibitor (NI) when applied with ammonium (NH4+)-based N fertiliser. The efficacy of nitrapyrin applications may be soil dependent however, being influenced by soil texture, organic carbon (C), and moisture. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of nitrapyrin on the nitrification process in soils of different physicochemical characteristics and resident microbial communities. Four agricultural soils were incubated in microcosms for five weeks, after which nitrapyrin effects were assessed for soil NH4+, nitrate (NO3-), the microbial functional genes ammonia-monooxygenase (amoA) and nitrite oxidoreductase (nxr), and bacterial and archaeal nitrifier genera using 16S rRNA sequencing. Nitrapyrin co-applied with urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) fertiliser inhibited nitrification, shown by increased retention of NH4+ in all four soils and a lower accumulation of NO3- in three of the four soils compared to UAN treated soil. These results are most likely due to the inhibition of growth of ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) as nitrapyrin plus UAN reduced bacterial amoA abundance in three of the four soils compared to the UAN treatment. This study is the first to report increased archaeal amoA abundance in response to the co-application of nitrapyrin and UAN in four soils, possibly due to reduced competition from AOB. The bacterial nitrifier genera Nitrosospira and Nitrospira and archaeal nitrifier genus Nitrososphaera were detected in all four soils using 16S rRNA sequencing. The effects of nitrapyrin on downstream N transformations were assessed based on tar and Nitrospira abundance though no conclusive treatment effects could be discerned for the four soils. Our results provide evidence of the interplay of AOB, ammonia oxidising archaea (AOA) and nitrite-oxidising bacteria (NOB) in nitrapyrin and fertiliser treated soils and will be useful in developing strategies to improve the efficacy of nitrification inhibitors in future studies.

TI Carbon-Rich g-C3N4 Nanotubes with Highly Dispersed
   Cobalt as a Catalyst to Degrade Sulfamethoxazole in the Vis-PMS System:
   Nonradical Oxidation Role
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB As one of the typical antibiotics, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) has attracted widespread attention because of its nonbiodegradability and persistence. Here, a novel carbon-rich graphite carbon nitride nanotube with nitrogen vacancies and highly dispersed cobalt doping (Co-CN) was prepared based on porous tubular carbon nitride (PTCN) by a simple one-step thermal polymerization method employing urea, melamine, and cobalt(II) phthalocyanine as raw materials. Characterization results showed that highly distributed Co atoms were evenly doped in the CN ring of g-C3N4. Under visible light irradiation with the assistance of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) (the Vis-PMS system), the best Co-CN catalyst showed a rate of 0.222 min(-1) to SMX degradation, which was 31 times that of PTCN/Vis-PMS, with only 0.020 mg/L cobalt leaching. Further investigation showed that nonradical O-1(2) was predominantly responsible for the SMX degradation, and h(+), O-2(center dot-), and high-valent cobalt species also made certain contributions. Therefore, neither the pH nor the anion of the solution had much of an effect on the degradation process. Moreover, the degradation pathways of SMX were proposed, and an assessment of the ecotoxicity of the resulting byproducts was also conducted. In general, this work developed a new photocatalyst for potential applications to remove organic pollutants from water and wastewater.

TI Valuation of bimetallic Pd/Ni nanoparticles catalyst for the
   applications in direct methanol fuel cells
SO POLYMERS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES
AB The electrospinning method has been successfully employed to prepare various percentages of less expensive nickel/palladium (NP) nanofiber catalysts as an alternative to platinum in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). The chemical structure, morphological characteristics, and electrochemical (EC) properties have been investigated using a variety of analysis techniques. According to the scanning electron microscope (SEM), all prepared samples with different Pd concentrations exhibit good nanofiber form and a distinct nanoparticle look. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals an amorphous carbon nanofiber structure with imbedded crystalline spheres of nickel and palladium. The carbonized polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers (PVANFs) have a steady and even distribution of nickel and palladium with an accurate nickel and palladium content, according to the energy dispersive X-ray mapping results. The lack of hydroxide or oxide phases in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern proves that Ni-Pd nanoparticles are present in the metallic phase. For the electrooxidation of methanol, urea, and an isopropanol-methanol mixture, the electrocatalytic features of the fabricated samples have been examined. EC results show that methanol has the best electrocatalytic properties. Hence, NP nanofiber catalysts could be a promising candidate to replace platinum in DMFC.

TI Adolescent Presentations of Inborn Errors of Metabolism
SO JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB Several studies have shown that a large percentage of inborn errors of metabolism is present in adolescent patients. Individually, each diagnosis in this category of diseases is rare; therefore, there is often a significant delay in determining the etiology of a patient's complaints. These disorders can have a wide variety of multisystemic presentations, several of which overlap with more common disorders of adolescence. This review highlights the red-flag findings on history and physical examination indicating a possible inborn error of metabolism. In addition, a systematic approach for evaluating and categorizing these disorders is introduced and demonstrated through case examples. Primary care physicians play a crucial role in the early detection and prompt treatment of patients with late-onset inborn errors of metabolism. (c) 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

TI Synthesis and characterization of molybdenum complex supported on
   magnetic and non-magnetic supports: comparing their catalytic activity,
   selectivity, and reusability
SO JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB A molybdenum complex was immobilized on Schiff-base-modified magnetic and non-magnetic particles by covalent linkage. The characterizations of the obtained materials were carried out by means of TG-DTG, SEM, TEM, VSM, XPS, IR, and Raman microprobe techniques. All of them exhibited efficient activities in the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides by urea hydrogen peroxide oxidant. The advantages and disadvantages of these catalysts are discussed in detail. Molybdenum complex immobilized on silica bead can be recycled and recovered by simple filtration, but it demonstrated low activity in catalytic oxidation reaction. Immobilization on nano-SiO2 leads to the formation of nanocatalyst having high catalytic activity but inefficient reusability. The best results were obtained with nano-Fe3O4 magnetic support. The immobilized molybdenum complex on silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles can easily be recovered from the reaction system using an external magnet and reused several times with high yields.

TI High efficiency solar chemical conversion using electrochemically
   disordered titania nanotube arrays transplanted onto transparent
   conductive oxide electrodes
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Free-standing, one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) with a disordered surface structure are synthesized on transparent conducting substrates, and their opto-physicochemical properties and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) performances are examined in detail. A two-step anodization process is used to transplant TNAs grown on titanium foils onto fluorine-doped SnO2 substrates (denoted as W-TNAs), after which they are electrochemically reduced for 20 and 90 s (denoted as B-TNAs-20 and 90, respectively). The as-transplanted W-TNAs exhibit low PEC activities in terms of their photocurrent, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxidations of inorganic and organic substrates (iodide and urea, respectively) under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5; 100 mW cm(-2)), primarily because of the sluggish charge transfer through the poor electrically conductive TNA framework. The quick electrochemical reduction of the W-TNAs leads to an 8-fold larger photocurrent, while significantly accelerating the OER (by three times) and iodide and urea oxidation reactions (by 2 and similar to 20 tithes, respectively). These enhanced PEC activities of the B-TNAs are attributed to the creation of Ti3+ and associated oxygen vacancies which strengthen their n-type characteristics and thereby increase their electrical conductivity. The time-resolved photoluminescence spectra further reveal that the lifetime (tau) of the photogenerated charge carriers in the B-TNAs (tau = 0.33 ns) is an order of magnitude shorter than that of the W-TNAs (tau = 3.63 ns). The disordered surface exhibits a lower Faradaic efficiency for multi-electron transfer oxidation reactions and a higher Faradaic efficiency for single-electron transfer oxidation reactions compared to the W-TNAs. The detailed surface characterization and PEC mechanism are discussed.

TI Degradation of Oxalic Acid and Bisphenol A by Photocatalytic Ozonation
   with g-C3N4 Nanosheet under Simulated Solar
   Irradiation
SO OZONE-SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB Photocatalytic ozonation of organics under simulated solar irradiation with a g-C3N4 nanosheet was investigated. g-C3N4 was prepared by calcinations of urea and characterized by TEM, BET, XRD and UV-Vis. Oxalic acid and bisphenol A were used as model substances to evaluate its catalytic ability. The results showed that g-C3N4 possess 2D nanosheet structure. The degradation ratio of oxalic acid and bisphenol A with g-C3N4/O-3/Solar was 1.50 and 1.92 times as great as the sum ratio when it was individually degraded by g-C3N4/Solar and O-3, separately. The results of recycling experiment indicated that g-C3N4 catalyst is very stable under experimental conditions.

TI Synthesis of FeOOH/Zn(OH)2/CoS Ferromagnetic Nanocomposites
   and the Enhanced Mechanism of Magnetic Field for Their Electrochemical
   Performances
SO SMALL
AB The FeOOH/Zn(OH)(2)/CoS (FZC) nanocomposites are synthesized and show the outstanding electrochemical properties in both supercapacitor and catalytic hydrogen production. The specific area capacitance reaches 17.04 F cm(-2), which is more than ten times higher than that of FeOOH/Zn(OH)(2) (FZ) substrate: 1.58 F cm(-2)). FZC nanocomposites also exhibit the excellent cycling stability with an initial capacity retention rate of 93.6% after 10 000 long-term cycles. The electrolytic cell (FZC//FZC) assembled with FZC as both anode and cathode in the UOR (urea oxidation reaction)|| HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) coupled system requires a cell voltage of only 1.453 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Especially, the electrochemical performances of FZC nanocomposites are enhanced in magnetic field, and the mechanism is proposed based on Stern double layer model at electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI). More electrolyte ions reach the surface of FZC electrode material under Kelvin force, moreover, the warburg impedance of FZC nanocomposites decrease under magnetic field action, which results in the enhanced behaviors for both the energy storage and urea oxidation reaction .

TI Combustion synthesized crystalline La-Mn perovskite catalysts: Role of
   fuel molecule on thermal and chemical events
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Solution combustion synthesis (SCS) technique was applied to produce LaMnO3+delta with the aim to investigate the effect of the chemical nature of a series of six fuel molecules (glycine, maleic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, urea) on the combustion reaction mechanism and physicochemical properties of the as-prepared powders. The whole SCS process was found to involve two types of combustion reactions depending on the used sacrificial molecules. Type I (with glycine, maleic acid and succinic acid) was characterized by a one-step exothermic reaction implying a semi-decomposed mixed nitrate-fuel complex and NO2 arising from manganese nitrate decomposition. The heat emission allows reaching the temperature suitable for well crystallized as-prepared perovskite powders. Type II (with citric acid, acetic acid and urea) was typified by a multi stage process in which intermediate decomposition reactions occurred before the formation of a mixed nitrate-fuel complex. In this case, the heat emission became lower than that expected from stoichiometric reaction, thus limiting the completion of the direct reaction for perovskite production. Consequently, part (with citric acid and acetic acid) or totally (with urea) of lanthanum and manganese remained distinctly combined in two amorphous phases (La(OH)(2)NO3, MnOx) that were intimately mixed. With respect to other fuels, combustion synthesis, using glycine, produced better crystallized, more defective and performant catalytic perovskite phase toward deep ethanol oxidation.

   THAUMARCHAEOTA RECOVERED FROM NEAR-ANOXIC ENVIRONMENT
SO COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE BULGARE DES SCIENCES
AB Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) of phylum Thaumarchaeota are prevalent in a wide variety of environments including moderate and thermophilic habitats. The genomic information for the thermophilic AOA is very limited and narrows our understanding concerning their ecological success. Two thaumarchaeal draft genomes were recovered from Bulgarian hot spring Rupi II assigned to Candidatus Nitrosocaldus cavascurensis (R2.1-Nitrosocaldus) and lineage sp002898655 (R2.1-Nitrososphaerales_655) from Nitrososphaerales. The recovered genome of R2.1-Nitrososphaerales_655 encoded typical for the ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota features along with specific properties conditioned by the ecological niche of Rupi II hot spring. The reconstructed metabolic potential of R2.1-Nitrososphaerales_655 showed wide possibilities for utilization of various nitrogen-containing substrates - ammonia, urea, nitriles, nitro-aromatics, amino acids.

TI Radio-Frequency-Controlled Urea Dosing for NH3-SCR Catalysts:
   NH3 Storage Influence to Catalyst Performance under Transient
   Conditions
SO SENSORS
AB Current developments in exhaust gas aftertreatment led to a huge mistrust in diesel driven passenger cars due to their NOx emissions being too high. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia (NH3) as reducing agent is the only approach today with the capability to meet upcoming emission limits. Therefore, the radio-frequency-based (RF) catalyst state determination to monitor the NH3 loading on SCR catalysts has a huge potential in emission reduction. Recent work on this topic proved the basic capability of this technique under realistic conditions on an engine test bench. In these studies, an RF system calibration for the serial type SCR catalyst Cu-SSZ-13 was developed and different approaches for a temperature dependent NH3 storage were determined. This paper continues this work and uses a fully calibrated RF-SCR system under transient conditions to compare different directly measured and controlled NH3 storage levels, and NH3 target curves. It could be clearly demonstrated that the right NH3 target curve, together with a direct control on the desired level by the RF system, is able to operate the SCR system with the maximum possible NOx conversion efficiency and without NH3 slip.

TI Progress of pancreatitis disease biomarker alpha amylase enzyme by new
   nano optical sensor
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB A new nano optical sensor binuclear Pd-(2-aminothiazole) (urea), Pd(atz,ur) complex was prepared and characterized for the assessment of the activity of alpha amylase enzyme in urine and serum samples for early diagnosis of Pancreatitis disease. The assessment of alpha amylase activity is carried out by the quenching of the luminescence intensity of the nano optical sensor binuclear Pd(atz,ur) complex at 457 nm by the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol (2-CNP) which produced from the reaction of the enzyme with 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-maltotrioside (CNPG3) substrate. The remarkable quenching of the luminescence intensity at 457 nm of nano Pd(atz,ur) doped in sol-gel matrix by various concentrations of the 2-CNP was successfully used as an optical sensor for the assessment of alpha-amylase activity. The calibration plot was achieved over the concentration range 8.5 x 10(-6) to 1.9 x 10(-9) mol L-1 2-CNP with a correlation coefficient of (0.999) and a detection limit of (7.4 x 10(-10) mol L-1). The method was used satisfactorily for the assessment of the alpha-amylase activity over activity range (3-321 U/L) in different urine and serum samples of pancreatitis patients. The assessment of the alpha amylase biomarker by the proposed method increases its sensitivity (96.88%) and specificity (94.41%) for early diagnosis of pancreatitis diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Overpotential-dependent shape evolution of gold nanocrystals grown in a
   deep eutectic solvent
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB This paper reports an overpotential-dependent shape evolution of gold nanocrystals (Au NCs) in a choline chloride-urea (ChCl-urea) based deep eutectic solvent (DES). It was found that the growth overpotentials play a key role in tuning the shape of Au NCs. The shape evolution of Au NCs successively from concave rhombic dodecahedra (RD) to concave cubes, octopods, cuboctahedral boxes, and finally, to hollow octahedra (OH) was achieved by carefully controlling the growth overpotentials in the range from -0.50 to -0.95 V (vs. Pt quasi-reference electrode). In addition, the presence of urea was important in the shape evolution of Au NCs. The surface structure of the as-prepared Au NCs was comprehensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemical studies. It was demonstrated that the electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared Au NCs for D-glucose electrooxidation was sensitively dependent on their morphologies. The results illustrated that the dehydrogenated glucose adsorbed on concave RD and concave cubic Au NCs was preferentially transformed to gluconolactone at low electrode potentials. Subsequent gluconolactone oxidation occurred favorably on octopods with {111}-truncated arms and hollow OH at high electrode potential. This study opens up a new approach to develop the surface-structurecontrolled growth of Au NCs by combining DES with electrochemical techniques. In addition, it is significant for the tuning of the electrocatalytic properties of NCs.

   by Heteropolyanion-Based Ionic Liquids
SO MOLECULES
AB Efficient, eco-friendly and sustainable access to 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones directly from alcohols under microwave and solvent-free conditions has been reported. The practical protocol involves heteropolyanion-based catalyzed oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes with NaNO3 as the oxidant followed by cyclocondensation with dicarbonyl compounds and urea or thiourea in a two-step, one-pot manner. Compatibility with different functional groups, good to excellent yields and reusable catalysts are the main highlights. The utilization of alcohols instead of aldehydes is a valid and green alternative to the classical Biginelli reaction.

TI Synthesis of boron and nitrogen-doped expanded graphite as efficient
   reinforcement for Al2O3-C refractories
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Boron and nitrogen doped expanded graphite (B-doped EG & N-doped EG) were synthesized for the first time by annealing the mixtures, obtained from the suspensions of expanded graphite (EG) with boric acid and urea, respectively. Afterwards, the doped EG were introduced into Al2O3-C refractories by partially replacing the graphite flake. Synthesized materials were characterized using SEM-EDS, XPS, XRD, TG-DSC and Raman Spectroscopy. Also, evaluation of various mechanical properties and oxidation resistance tests were conducted. Boron (B) and Nitrogen (N) were successfully introduced into the C skeleton via different C-B bonds (B4C, B-sub C and BC2O) and C-N bonds (pyridine-N, amino-N and graphitic-N) respectively, maintaining the hexagonal graphitic lattice and lower reactivity. Compared to as-received EG, the B-doped EG and N-doped EG remained relatively intact structure in Al2O3-C refractories at high temperature due to their less defects and lower reactivity. Addition of B-doped EG and N-doped EG into Al2O3-C refractories showed improved mechanical properties such as modulus of rupture (CMOR), force, displacement and thermal shock resistance. Besides, the Al2O3-C specimens containing B-doped EG and N-doped EG exhibited significantly better oxidation resistance, which further promote the reinforcement effect of doped EG in Al2O3-C refractories during actual service condition.

TI Bimetallic nickel/manganese phosphate-carbon nanofiber electrocatalyst
   for the oxidation of formaldehyde in alkaline medium
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The development of earth-abundant transition metal-based catalysts, supported by a conductive carbonaceous matrix, has received great attention in the field of conversion of formaldehyde derivatives into toxic-free species. Herein, we report a comprehensive investigation of bimetallic electrocatalyst activity towards the electrooxidation of formaldehyde. The bimetallic phosphate catalyst is prepared by co-precipitation of Ni and Mn phosphate precursors using a simple reflux approach. Then the bimetallic catalyst is produced by mixing the Ni/Mn with carbon fibres (CNFs). The structural properties and crystallinity of the catalyst were investigated by using several techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Brunauer Emmett-Teller theory. The system performance was studied under potentiostatic conditions. Some theoretical thermodynamic and kinetic models were applied to assess the system performance. Accordingly, key electrochemical parameters, including surface coverage (Gamma) of active species, charge transfer rate (k(s)), diffusion coefficient of the formaldehyde (D), and catalytic rate constant (k(cat)) were calculated at Gamma = 1.690 x 10(-4) mmol cm(-2), k(s) = 1.0800 s(-1), D = 1.185 x 10(-3) cm(2) s(-1) and k(cat) = 1.08 x 10(5) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1). These findings demonstrate the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of formaldehyde electrooxidation on nickel/manganese phosphate- CNFs in alkaline medium.

SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Spinel MnxZn1-x Fe2O4 (0.0 <= x <= 1.0) nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully synthesized by a facile one-pot microwave combustion method using urea as the fuel. The formation of single phase cubic spinel structure was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and the calculated average crystallite size is in the range of 37.57 nm to 25.43 nm. The high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) results indicated that the as-prepared spinel MnxZn1-x Fe2O4 NPs showed high crystallinity and uniform size distribution with particles-like morphologies. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was confirmed the elemental composition and purity of the samples. The estimated band gap energy from UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis. DRS) is about 1.88 eV to 2.35 eV. The broad visible emission band is observed in the entire photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy for all compositions. The variation of magnetization (M-s) value of the samples was studied by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and the lower compositions (x = 0.0, 0.2 and 0.4) show a superparamagnetism and the higher composition (x = 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) show a ferromagnetic behavior with hysteresis and that the M-s values increased with increasing Mn2+ content to reach a maximum value of 60.99 emu/g for MnFe2O4. All composition of spinel MnxZn1-x Fe2O4 NPs were successfully tested as catalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde, which has resulted 83.29 and 96.51% conversion efficiency of ZnFe2O4 and Mn0.6Zn0.4 Fe2O4 respectively.

TI Effects of inorganic and organic fertilizers on CO2 and
   CH4 fluxes from tea plantation soil
SO ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
AB Agricultural practices such as fertilization considerably influence soil greenhouse gas fluxes. However, the effects of fertilization on greenhouse gases fluxes remain unclear in tea soil when soil nitrogen is low. In the present study, soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes under various fertilization treatments in tea soil were investigated during a 50-day period. The experiment consisted of five treatments: no fertilizer (CK), single nitrogen (urea, N), single oilseed rape cake fertilizer (R), nitrogen + cake fertilizer (2:1, NR1), and nitrogen + cake fertilizer (1:2, NR2). The fertilization proportion of NR1 and NR2 was determined by the nitrogen content of nitrogen fertilizer and cake fertilizer. The results revealed that the single application of nitrogen had no significant effect on soil CO2 flux. However, the addition of cake fertilizer significantly increased CO2 emissions through enhanced soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC). Additionally, CO2 emissions were directly proportional to the amount of carbon (C) in the fertilizer. All treatments were minor sinks for CH4 except for the treatment NR1. Specifically, the cumulative CH4 fluxes of NR1 and NR2 were significantly higher than rest of the three treatments, which implies that application of urea and oilseed rape cake reduced the capability of CH4 oxidation in tea soil. Structural equation models indicated that soil CO2 flux is significantly and positively correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon, MBC and soil pH, while mineral nitrogen content was the main factor affecting CH4 flux. Overall, the application of oilseed rape cake increased the oxidation of CH4 and promoted soil C sequestration but inevitably increased the soil CO2 emissions.

   nitride for efficient metal-free catalysis
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-doped carbon materials are proposed as promising metal-free catalysts for persulfate-mediated catalytic oxidation process, yet the nitrogen content in the final carbon products is typically low. Moreover, controversies remain in the unambiguous identification of active sites in nitrogen-doped carbons for persulfate activation. Here we report the facile synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon material via one-step pyrolysis of urea and D-mannitol, which simultaneously combine ultrahigh nitrogen content (up to 33.75 at%) with apparent porous structure via transformation from graphitic carbon nitride. With this strategy, the highly nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NC1.0) exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for oxidation of organic pollutants. Both experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for the first time, revealed that the electron-rich graphitic N and electron-deficient carbon atom adjacent to graphitic N in NC1.0, served as active sites for PMS reduction and oxidation toward the generation of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), respectively, in which PMS oxidation was the main reaction in the course of PMS activation rendering O-1(2) the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the NC1.0/PMS system. More importantly, NC1.0 presents robust stability in PMS activation, superior to most reported nitrogen-doped carbon-based catalysts, offering great promise for practical environmental remediation.

TI Efficient glucose-to-HMF conversion in deep eutectic solvents over
   sulfonated dendrimer modified activated carbon
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB In this study, a solid acid catalyst was designed by growing thiol-based dendrimer up to third generation on the surface of activated carbon (AC) by the thiol-ene click reaction and subsequent transformation to sulfonic acid groups. Characterization results displayed the successful grafting of sulfonic acid groups with high density on dendrimer functionalized AC through the oxidation of thiol groups. The efficiency of the obtained catalyst was explored in the acid-catalyzed transformation of glucose to 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using deep eutectic solvents (DESs). The most effective DES was choline chloride:urea (ChCl:urea), which provided an HMF yield of 96% after 1 h of reaction time at 100 degrees C from glucose. Some control experiments demonstrated that the alkalinity of nitrogen in the dendrimer structure combined with of urea has an important synergistic effect in enhancing the glucose isomerization to fructose, thus improving the reaction efficiency. Additionally, the presence of dendritic structure contributed to the catalytic activity by making the sulfonic acid group highly reactive. Both the catalyst and DES were used for five cycles without significant descent in catalytic activity.

TI Single-atom catalysis: a promising avenue for precisely controlling
   reaction pathways
SO FRONTIERS OF CHEMICAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Single-atom catalysts (SACs), characterized by exceptionally high atom efficiency, have garnered significant attention across various catalytic reactions. Recent studies have showcased SACs with robust capabilities for precise catalysis, specifically targeting reactions along designated pathways. This review focuses on the advances in the precise activation and reconstruction of chemical bonds on SACs, including precise activation of C-O and C-H bonds and selective couplings involving C-C and C-N bonds. Our discussion begins with a thorough exploration of the factors that render SACs skilled in precise catalytic processes, encompassing the narrow d-band electronic state of single atom site resulting in the adsorption tendency, isolate site resulting in unique adsorption structure, and synergy effect of a single atom site with its neighbors. Subsequently, we elaborate on the applications of SACs in electrocatalysis and thermocatalysis including four prominent reactions, namely, electrochemical CO2 reduction, urea electrochemical synthesis, CO2 hydrogenation, and CH4 activation. Then the concept of rational design of SACs for precisely controlling reaction pathways is discussed from the aspects of pore structure design, support-metal strong interaction, and support hydrophilic/hydrophobic. Finally, we summarize the challenges encountered by SACs in the field of precise catalytic processes and outline prospects for their further development in this domain.

TI A reusable material with high performance for removing NO at room
   temperature: performance, mechanism and kinetics
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Removing NO from the air with a reusable material at room temperature is challenging. In this study, a series of urea-MnOx/ACF and urea-x(CeO2-(1 - x) MnO2)/ACF materials were prepared and used for removing NO at room temperature. The results showed that 10% urea-8% (0.5CeO(2)-0.5MnO(2))/ACF yielded the highest NO conversion, which showed an NO conversion ratio above 90% with 1000 ppm NO in the initial mixed gases. Moreover, the NO conversion exceeded 98% when the NO concentration was 100 ppm in the initial mixed gases. More importantly, 10% urea-8% (0.5CeO(2)-0.5MnO(2))/ACF was stable even after it was regenerated by reloading with urea, demonstrating that the material could be easily reused and its high performance was maintained. Finally, the mechanism and kinetics of the NO removal was discussed.

TI Expanded metabolic versatility of ubiquitous nitrite-oxidizing bacteria
   from the genus Nitrospira
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Nitrospira are a diverse group of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and among the environmentally most widespread nitrifiers. However, they remain scarcely studied and mostly uncultured. Based on genomic and experimental data from Nitrospira moscoviensis representing the ubiquitous Nitrospira lineage II, we identified ecophysiological traits that contribute to the ecological success of Nitrospira. Unexpectedly, N. moscoviensis possesses genes coding for a urease and cleaves urea to ammonia and CO2. Ureolysis was not observed yet in nitrite oxidizers and enables N. moscoviensis to supply ammonia oxidizers lacking urease with ammonia from urea, which is fully nitrified by this consortium through reciprocal feeding. The presence of highly similar urease genes in Nitrospira lenta from activated sludge, in metagenomes from soils and freshwater habitats, and of other ureases in marine nitrite oxidizers, suggests a wide distribution of this extended interaction between ammonia and nitrite oxidizers, which enables nitrite-oxidizing bacteria to indirectly use urea as a source of energy. A soluble formate dehydrogenase lends additional ecophysiological flexibility and allows N. moscoviensis to use formate, with or without concomitant nitrite oxidation, using oxygen, nitrate, or both compounds as terminal electron acceptors. Compared with Nitrospira defluvii from lineage I, N. moscoviensis shares the Nitrospira core metabolism but shows substantial genomic dissimilarity including genes for adaptations to elevated oxygen concentrations. Reciprocal feeding and metabolic versatility, including the participation in different nitrogen cycling processes, likely are key factors for the niche partitioning, the ubiquity, and the high diversity of Nitrospira in natural and engineered ecosystems.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Urea can be used as an effective hydrogen energy carrier, the development of efficient and stable anodic electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) was crucial for achieved energy-saving hydrogen-production. Nanoflower like structures electrocatalysts have attracted increasing research interests due to its structural advantages. In this article, NiFeS/SSM with two dimensions (2D) nanosflower like structures in situ growth on three dimensions (3D) stainless steel mesh (SSM) is prepared by step-wise hydrothermal method. NiFeS/SSM was derived from NiFe layered double hydroxides, and the as-prepared electrode was directly served as a electrocatalysts for UOR. Benefiting from the electronic effect between Ni and Fe components which promotes the formation of the high valence Ni species in the NiFeS/SSM catalyst, the tuning effect from the in situ generated sulfate and its open 3D porous structure for SSM basement. The electrode displayed excellent catalytic activities towards UOR, the overpotential for UOR are 1.08 V in alkaline electrolyte at 50 mA center dot cm-2. This work not only illustrated that non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts have tremendous potential applications for electrocatalytic electrolysis of urea but also provided a feasible strategy to prepare high-efficiency and stable non-precious metal UOR anode catalysts in alkaline medium.

TI Coupled and decoupled electrochemical water splitting for boosting
   hydrogen evolution: A review and perspective
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Developing innovative water electrolysis system to realize the energy-saving hydrogen production and prevent the H2/O2 mixing is of vital importance for further boosting the sustainable development of water electrolysis for hydrogen production. Recent years have witnessed the rapid expansion of the research about the coupled and decoupled water electrolysis, in which the coupled water electrolysis system is associated with the replacement of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with kinetically favorable sacrificial agent or biomass oxidation reaction, and the decoupled water electrolysis can be described as separating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER by introducing appropriate redox mediators. To gain a deep understanding of these two interesting research fields, we here organize a comprehensive review of the recent progress of coupled and decoupled electrochemical water splitting for boosting hydrogen production. After providing a discussion about the fundamentals of decoupled and coupled water splitting and comparing with conventional water electrolysis, we have highlighted the advantages of these two systems. Subsequently, a comprehensive discussion about the application of these two systems are provided, including the structural features, reaction mechanisms, and the properties of decoupled systems. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of these two water electrolysis systems for the commercialization are manifested.

TI A Physiological and Genomic Comparison of Nitrosomonas Cluster 6a
   and 7 Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria
SO MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) within the genus Nitrosomonas perform the first step in nitrification, ammonia oxidation, and are found in diverse aquatic and terrestrial environments. Nitrosomonas AOB were grouped into six defined clusters, which correlate with physiological characteristics that contribute to adaptations to a variety of abiotic environmental factors. A fundamental physiological trait differentiating Nitrosomonas AOB is the adaptation to either low (cluster 6a) or high (cluster 7) ammonium concentrations. Here, we present physiological growth studies and genome analysis of Nitrosomonas cluster 6a and 7 AOB. Cluster 6a AOB displayed maximum growth rates at <= 1 mM ammonium, while cluster 7 AOB had maximum growth rates at >= 5 mM ammonium. In addition, cluster 7 AOB were more tolerant of high initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations than cluster 6a AOB. Cluster 6a AOB were completely inhibited by an initial nitrite concentration of 5 mM. Genomic comparisons were used to link genomic traits to observed physiological adaptations. Cluster 7 AOB encode a suite of genes related to nitrogen oxide detoxification and multiple terminal oxidases, which are absent in cluster 6a AOB. Cluster 6a AOB possess two distinct forms of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and select species encode genes for hydrogen or urea utilization. Several, but not all, cluster 6a AOB can utilize urea as a source of ammonium. Hence, although Nitrosomonas cluster 6a and 7 AOB have the capacity to fulfill the same functional role in microbial communities, i.e., ammonia oxidation, differentiating species-specific and cluster-conserved adaptations is crucial in understanding how AOB community succession can affect overall ecosystem function.

TI The link between phenotype and fatty acid metabolism in advanced chronic
   kidney disease
SO NEPHROLOGY DIALYSIS TRANSPLANTATION
AB Background. The kidney plays a central role in elimination of metabolic waste products and regulation of low-molecular weight metabolites via glomerular filtration, tubular secretion and reabsorption. Disruption of these processes results in profound changes in the biochemical milieu of the body fluids, which contribute to complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by inducing cytotoxicity and inflammation. Insight into the changes of the composition of metabolites and dysregulation of target genes and proteins enhances the understanding of the pathophysiology of CKD and its complications, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Chronic interstitial nephropathy is a common cause of CKD. The present study was designed to determine the effect of chronic interstitial nephropathy on the composition of serum metabolites and regulation of oxidative, inflammatory, fibrotic and cytoprotective pathways.
   Methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the CKD and control groups (n = 8/group). CKD was induced by administration of adenine (200 mg/kg body weight/day) by oral gavage for 3 weeks. The control group was treated with the vehicle alone. The animals were then observed for an additional 3 weeks, at which point they were sacrificed and kidney and serum samples were collected. Serum metabolomic and lipidomic analyses were performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight high-definition mass spectrometry. Kidney tissues were processed for histological and molecular biochemical analyses.
   Results. CKD rats exhibited increased plasma urea and creatinine concentrations, renal interstitial fibrosis, tubular damage and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant and profibrotic pathways. Comparison of serum from CKD and control rats revealed significant differences in concentrations of amino acids and lipids including 33 metabolites and 35 lipid species. This was associated withmarked abnormalities of fatty acid oxidation, and c-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism in CKD rats. Logistic regression analysis identified tetracosanoic acid, docosatrienoic acid, PC(18: 3/14: 1) and L-aspartic acid, tetracosanoic acid and docosatrienoic acid as novel biomarkers of chronic interstitial nephropathy.
   Conclusions. Advanced CKD in rats with adenine-induced chronic interstitial nephropathy results in profound changes in the serum metabolome, activation of inflammatory, oxidative and fibrotic pathways, and suppression of cytoprotective and antioxidant pathways.

AB The utilization of ultrathin Mn-metal-organic framework (Mn-UMOF) nanosheets for oxidase-like nanozyme activity has been demonstrated. The Mn-UMOF exhibited superior nanozyme activity to oxidize chromogenic TMB and ABTS than the bulk Mn-BMOF. Based on this fact, a platform for the colorimetric sensing of L-cysteine (L-cys) has been established over the detection of other amino acids and natural compounds such as urea and glucose. In addition, the Mn-UMOF has the capability of catalyzing the oxidation of amplex red to the fluorescent first oxidized product, which has been used to develop a fluorescence turn-off sensor for the selective sensing of L-cys.

TI Edge-oriented N-Doped WS2 Nanoparticles on Porous
   Co3N Nanosheets for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution and
   Nitrogenous Nucleophile Electrooxidation
SO SMALL
AB Earth-abundant layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a well-known electrocatalyst for acidic hydrogen evolution, but it becomes rather sluggish for alkaline hydrogen or oxygen evolution due to the low-density edge sites, poor conductivity, and unfavorable water dissociation behavior. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy to construct an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst by in situ growing N-doped WS2 nanoparticles on highly conductive cobalt nitride (N-WS2/Co3N) for concurrent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is demonstrated. Benefiting from the good conductivity of Co3N, rich well-oriented edge sites and water-dissociation sites at the nanoscale interfaces between N-WS2 and Co3N, the resultant N-WS2/Co3N exhibits remarkable HER activity in 1 m potasium hydroxide (KOH) requiring a small overpotential of 67 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with outstanding long-term durability at 500 mA cm(-2), representing the best alkaline hydrogen-evolving activity among reported WS2 catalysts. In particular, this hybrid catalyst also shows exceptional catalytic activities toward theurea oxidation reaction featured by very low potentials of 1.378 and 1.41 V to deliver 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) along with superb large-current stability in 1 m KOH + 0.5 m urea. Moreover, the assembled two-electrode cell delivers the industrially practical current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.72 V with excellent durability in alkaline urea-containing solutions, outperforming most MoS2-like bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting reported hitherto. This work provides a promising avenue for the development of high-performance WS2-based electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting.

TI Photo-catalytic dye degradation of methyl orange using zirconia-zeolite
   nanoparticles
SO BULLETIN OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB In this research, the dye photo-catalytic removal was investigated using zirconia (ZrO2) nanocatalysts, zeolite (Ze), ZrO2-Ze with different percentages and optimized ZrO2-Ze doped via urea, copper oxide and cerium oxide. In order to determine the optimal conditions, the effects of different catalysts and parameters such as dye concentration, UV lamp power, amount of the loaded catalyst and pH were investigated. The response surface methodology was used to obtain optimal experimental conditions. Physical and chemical properties of materials were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller. Completely methyl orange (MO)-dye removal (100%) was achieved at optimal conditions under UV light during 80 min. The optimal operational condition for MO photo-catalytic decomposition using an optimal N-doped 10 wt% ZrO2-zeolite nanocatalyst was obtained at UV lamp power, pH, catalyst loading and dye concentration of 15 W, 3, 0.4 g l-1 and 5 mg l-1, respectively. Photo-catalytic degradation kinetics of MO described well using pseudo-first order which is in accordance with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model (kapp=0.031min-1).

TI A supplemental intravenous amino acid infusion sustains a positive
   protein balance for 24 hours in critically ill patients
SO CRITICAL CARE
AB Background: Providing supplemental amino acids to ICU patients during a 3-h period results in improved whole-body net protein balance, without an increase in amino acid oxidation. The primary objective was to investigate if a 24-h intravenous amino acid infusion in critically ill patients has a sustained effect on whole-body protein balance as was seen after 3 h. Secondary objectives were monitoring of amino acid oxidation rate, urea and free amino acid plasma concentrations.
   Methods: An infusion of [1-C-13]-phenylalanine was added to ongoing enteral nutrition to quantify the enteral uptake of amino acids. Primed intravenous infusions of [ring-H-2(5)]-phenylalanine and [3,3-H-2(2)]-tyrosine were used to assess whole-body protein synthesis and breakdown, to calculate net protein balance and to assess amino acid oxidation at baseline and at 3 and 24 hours. An intravenous amino acid infusion was added to nutrition at a rate of 1 g/kg/day and continued for 24 h.
   Results: Eight patients were studied. The amino acid infusion resulted in improved net protein balance over time, from -1.6 +/- 7.9 mu mol phe/kg/h at 0 h to 6.0 +/- 8.8 at 3 h and 7.5 +/- 5.1 at 24 h (p = 0.0016). The sum of free amino acids in plasma increased from 3.1 +/- 0.6 mmol/L at 0 h to 3.2 +/- 0.3 at 3 h and 3.6 +/- 0.5 at 24 h (p = 0.038). Amino acid oxidation and plasma urea were not altered significantly.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated that the improvement in whole-body net protein balance from a supplemental intravenous amino acid infusion seen after 3 h was sustained after 24 h in critically ill patients.

TI Transition-Metal Phosphides: Activity Origin, Energy-Related
   Electrocatalysis Applications, and Synthetic Strategies
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Developing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts plays an important role in energy-related electrocatalysis fields. Transition-metal phosphides (TMPs) possess a series of advantages, such as high conductivity, earth-abundance reserves, and good physicochemical properties, therefore arousing wide attention. In this review, the electrochemical activity origin of TMPs, allowing the rational design and construction of phosphides toward various energy-relevant reactions is first discussed. Subsequently, their unique energy-related electrocatalysis nature toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and others is highlighted. Then, the TMPs' synthetic strategies are analyzed and summarized systematically. Finally, the existing key issues, countermeasures, and the future challenges of TMPs toward efficient energy-related electrocatalysis are briefly discussed.

TI Electrochemistry of Nickelocene-Ferrocene Organometallic Complexes for
   Electrodeposition of Nickel-Iron-Based Nanostructured Film under Ambient
   Conditions for Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB This study explores the interesting redox chemistry of organometallic complexes nickelocene (Nc) and ferrocene (Fc) as well as their instability as metal inorganic complexs in electrolytes on the application of bias to derive bimetallic NiFe-based nanostructured films at room temperature conditions in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. The cyclic voltammogram of the two complexes under optimized conditions revealed that the redox peaks for Fc lie between the two redox peaks of Nc, which gave us the freedom of individual potential windows for the deposition of Ni and Fe in one step. The transformation of the metal inorganic complex to the respective nanostructured oxides was investigated using in situ UV-visible spectroscopy method, and the electrodeposited product was characterized using XRD, TEM, Raman, and XPS techniques. Furthermore, the bimetallic films were tested for their catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The optimized nanoscale thicknesses of Ni and NiFe films deposited in 15 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles showed the best performance toward both urea and water oxidation, respectively. The NiFe-15 showed only 258 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm-2 and an impressive TOF of 1.02 s-1 at 300 mV overpotential. Electrocatalytic studies reveal that the presence of iron increases the OER efficiency and adversely affects UOR. In-situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that the active site for the OER is higher valence oxo species of NiOOH while for UOR, NiOOH was found to be an active species. Our research reports an improved, user-friendly approach for electrode fabrication of an NiFe-based catalyst but also opens a different pathway toward the application of organometallic complexes for the design of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.

TI Photocatalytic Activity of Nickel Sulfide Composite Powders Synthesized
   by Solution Combustion Method
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Nickel sulfide composite powders were prepared through solution combustion synthesis using nickel nitrate as both nickel source and oxidant, together with various amounts of mixed urea-thiourea fuels. The precursor solutions were ignited by conventional and microwave heating. The combustion reaction behavior, phase structure and optical properties were analyzed as a function of fuel amounts. The combusted powders were composed of alpha-NiS, NiS2, Ni3S2 and NiO phases related to the fuel content and heating mode. The higher combustion temperature in microwave heating led to the oxidation of sulfide phase to nickel oxide. The highest amount of NiS phase with the maximum removal efficiency of methylene blue (MB) (similar to 52%) was achieved when conventional synthesis procedure with a urea to thiourea molar ratio of 2:0.75, was employed.

TI Effect of HO<SUP>•</SUP>, SO4<SUP>•-</SUP> and
   CO3<SUP>•-</SUP>/HCO3<SUP>•</SUP> radicals on the
   photodegradation of the herbicide amitrole by UV radiation in aqueous
   solution
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This study analyzed the photodegradation of the herbicide amitrole (AMT) in water by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) based on ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UV, UV/H2O2, UV/Fe2+/H2O2, UV/K2S2O8, and UV/Na2CO3) and examined the influence of the initial concentration of radical generators, the solution pH, and the chemical composition of the water. The values of AMT reaction rate constants with HO center dot, SO4 center dot- and CO3 center dot-/HCO3 center dot radicals obtained at pH 7 were 5.85 +/- 0.25 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), 3.77 +/- 0.17 x 108 M-1 s(-1), and 1.37 +/- 0.12 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1), respectively. The AMT degradation rate constant in the absence of radical generators (0.013 +/- 0.001 min(-1)) was considerably increased by their addition, yielding values of 0.037 +/- 0.005, 0.059 +/- 0.009, or 0.024 +/- 0.002 min(-1) with only 0.15 x 10(-3) mol L-1 H2O2, K2S2O8, or Na2CO3, respectively. In all cases, these constants increased with greater amounts of reagent, reaching values of 0.309 +/- 0.032, 0.748 +/- 0.091, and 0.043 +/- 0.004 min(-1), respectively, with the addition of 3.47 x 10(-3) mol L-1 of the corresponding radical generator. The percentage of total organic carbon removal showed the same trend as the AMT degradation rate, reaching 86.8% with the addition of 3.47 x 10(-3) mol L-1 H2O2 and increasing to 99.0% when 0.04 x 10(-3) mol L-1 Fe2+ was added to the system. We analyzed the effectiveness of three systems (UV/H2O2, UV/K2S2O8, and UV/Na2CO3) for AMT photodegradation in different types of water (ultrapure, tap, and treated urban wastewaters), verifying their high effectiveness, especially UV/K2S2O8. The high efficacy of these systems is related to the generation of both SO4 center dot- and HO center dot radicals and the greater selectivity of SO4 center dot- radical in its reaction with AMT.

TI Extraction, characterization and chemical functionalization of
   phosphorylated cellulose derivatives from Giant Reed Plant
SO CELLULOSE
AB In this work, cellulose microfibers (CMFs) and cellulose nanocrystals (P-CNCs) having phosphoric groups on their surfaces were prepared by phosphorylation of cellulose extracted from Giant Reed plant, using ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4) in a water-based urea system and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) without urea as phosphorous agents, respectively. Phosphorylated samples were studied in terms of their charge content, chemical structure, crystallinity, morphology, and thermal stability using several characterization techniques. Conductometric titration results showed higher charge content after phosphorylation with urea for P-CMFs about 3133 mmol kg(-1), while without urea P-CNCs exhibited 254 mmol kg(-1). FTIR analysis confirmed the total removal of non-cellulosic compounds from microfibers' surface and their partial oxidation after phosphorylation. XRD analysis proved that the P-CMFs and P-CNCs exhibited cellulose I structure, with a crystallinity index of 70 and 83%, respectively. SEM and AFM observations showed micro-sized and needle-like morphologies for P-CMFs and P-CNCs with an average diameter of 15 mu m and 20.5 nm, respectively. The thermal properties of P-CMFs indicate early dehydration with high char formation, while the high thermal stability of P-CNCs (T-max = 352 degrees C) was similar to that of microcrystalline cellulose. The present work showed new routes for preparing phosphorylated micro- and nano-cellulose from a new natural source, having new functions that benefit various applications.

TI Selection of catalytically active elements for removing NO and CO from
   flue gas at low temperatures
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with carbonic oxide (CO-SCR) has been suggested as an attractive and promising method for removing NO and CO simultaneously from flue gas. Nevertheless, the presence of oxygen has an inhibitory effect on the catalytic reaction. Based on CO-SCR on a urea modified metal oxide catalyst, a novel method was proposed to achieve NO and CO removal under oxygen-rich conditions via heterogeneous catalysis (CO-SCR, CO oxidation and urea-SCR). The selection of suitable active metal elements for catalysts is the pivotal issue in present research. This paper shows a comprehensive thermodynamic study for screening active metals through studying the properties of 28 different metal oxide reduction reactions and 11 different oxidation reactions at different temperatures referring to 20 preselected elements. This research mainly includes thermodynamic equilibrium calculations at different oxygen concentrations, detailed analyses of the NO and CO removal mechanism and thermodynamic screening of active metal elements based on the Gibbs free energy change (Delta G) at different temperatures. On the basis of the systematic thermodynamic study, the metal elements Mn, Cu, Pb and V have been selected as suitable for removing NO and CO from flue gas at low temperatures (50-120 degrees C).

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Urea was used as a reactant and base retardant for the controllable synthesis of octadecahedral BiVO4 (OD-BiVO4) with exposed {111}, {010}, {011}, and {110} facets. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV/Vis spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The effect of the urea molecules on the morphology of BiVO4 was studied. The urea molecules show a preferential adsorption on the {111}, {010}, {011}, and {110} facets of BiVO4, and the urea molecules on the {111} facets retard the growth of the {010}, {011}, and {110} facets. The growth of BiVO4 in ammonia solution and through the urea hydrolysis method was studied in detail. The photocatalytic efficiency of OD-BiVO4 for the photodegradation of rhodamine B was also studied.

TI Single cell analyses reveal contrasting life strategies of the two main
   nitrifiers in the ocean
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, is a key process in marine nitrogen (N) cycling. Although oceanic ammonia and nitrite oxidation are balanced, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) vastly outnumber the main nitrite oxidizers, the bacterial Nitrospinae. The ecophysiological reasons for this discrepancy in abundance are unclear. Here, we compare substrate utilization and growth of Nitrospinae to AOA in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on our results, more than half of the Nitrospinae cellular N-demand is met by the organic-N compounds urea and cyanate, while AOA mainly assimilate ammonium. Nitrospinae have, under in situ conditions, around four-times higher biomass yield and five-times higher growth rates than AOA, despite their ten-fold lower abundance. Our combined results indicate that differences in mortality between Nitrospinae and AOA, rather than thermodynamics, biomass yield and cell size, determine the abundances of these main marine nitrifiers. Furthermore, there is no need to invoke yet undiscovered, abundant nitrite oxidizers to explain nitrification rates in the ocean.

TI Standalone nickel layered double hydroxide and nickel oxide electrodes
   as effective anodes in alkaline direct methanol fuel cell
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Direct methanol fuel cell is an emerging energy transformation system with the prospect of substituting secondary batteries soon due to their exciting features. One of the most limitations is the weak catalytic activity of the expensive nonprecious Pt-based catalysts at the fuel cell's anode. In this work, a standalone Nickel layered double hydroxide of hierarchical nanosheet structure was effectively synthesized on the nickel foam's surface through facile hydrothermal treatment that subsequently converted into NiO without destroying the structure by heat treatment at 500 degrees C. The synthesized standalone electrodes demonstrated a significant activity for methanol oxidation with an onset potential of 0.35 V in KOH (1 M), which is attributed to the Ni(OH)2 (Ni thorn 2)/(Ni thorn 3) NiOOH active site. The electrodes effectively discharged current at 0.5 V for more than 1 h with no performance degradation compared to the bare nickel foam. The better activity of the synthesized electrodes was attributed to the nanosheet structure layer's better charge and mass transfers, as confirmed by the morphological images (SEM images) and the electrochemical characteristics (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry, and cyclic (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI Metabolite Shifts Induced by Marathon Race Competition Differ between
   Athletes Based on Level of Fitness and Performance: A Substudy of the
   Enzy-MagIC Study
SO METABOLITES
AB This study compared metabolite shifts induced by training for, participation in, and recovery from a marathon race competition among athletes divided into three groups based on fitness (relative maximum oxygen uptake (VO(2)max)) and performance levels (net running time). Plasma samples from 76 male runners participating in the Munich Marathon were analyzed for metabolite shifts using a targeted metabolomics panel. For the entire cohort of runners, pronounced increases were measured immediately after the race for plasma concentrations of acylcarnitines (AC), the ratio (palmitoylcarnitine + stearoylcarnitine)/free carnitine that is used as a proxy for the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase, and arginine-related metabolites, with decreases in most amino acids (AA) and phospholipids. Plasma levels of AA and phospholipids were strongly increased 24 and 72 h post-race. Post-race plasma concentrations of AC and arginine-related metabolites were higher in the low compared to top performers, indicating an accumulation of fatty acids and a reliance on protein catabolism to provide energy after the marathon event. This study showed that marathon race competition is associated with an extensive and prolonged perturbation in plasma metabolite concentrations with a strong AC signature that is greater in the slower, less aerobically fit runners. Furthermore, changes in the arginine-related metabolites were observed.

   g-C3N4 Under Simulated Solar Irradiation: Removal
   Efficiency, Influence Factors, and Reaction Mechanism
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB Visible-light photocatalysis shows high removal efficiency and low cost. In this study, graphic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was prepared via one-step pyrolysis from urea under 550 - 620 degree celsius (namely T-g-C3N4). Of all T-g-C3N4, 600-g-C3N4 had a crystal structure, large surface area (85.21 m(2)<middle dot>g(-1)), and high content of periodic tri-s-triazine ring units. The conduction band energy and valence band energy of 600-g-C3N4 were estimated to be -1.11 and 1.56 eV. Rhodamine B (RhB) was selected as a representative refractory pollutant. With a RhB/600-g-C3N4 ratio of 0.1, the maximum RhB removal efficiency and mineralization efficiency reached 100% and 64%. O-2(center dot-), h(+), (OH)-O-center dot, and O-1(2) were the reactive oxygen species. Low pH values favored the photocatalysis. The 600-g-C3N4/visible light system was not affected by the presence of Cl-, NO3-, citric acid, and low-level humic acid but highly affected by NO2- and fulvic acid. The g-C3N4 kept high photocatalytic efficiencies in reuse of five times.

TI Changes in urinary stable nitrogen isotope ratios during controlled
   short-term energy deficit: a proof-of-principle analysis
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB Purpose Stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (delta N-15) have previously been shown to increase in human hair during periods of catabolism. The goal of this study was to assess changes in delta N-15 in urinary urea (delta N-15(urea)) and Delta N-15 during a short-term controlled energy deficit. Methods We analyzed samples from 6 recreationally active men (25 +/- 1 years, BMI: 23.5 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2)) who participated in a repeated measures cross-over study involving 4 days of energy deficit (ED, similar to 15 kcal/kg FFM) without and with exercise (ED-EX, ED + EX) and control conditions in energy balance (CON-EX, CON + EX). delta N-15(urea) was analyzed from urine samples, and Delta N-15 was calculated as delta N-15(urea)-delta N-15(diet), with delta N-15(diet) obtained from diet prescriptions. Results delta N-15(urea) was significantly elevated in ED-EX (4.4 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) when compared to CON-EX (3.7 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand; p = 0.026) and CON + EX (3.34 +/- 0.13 parts per thousand, p = 0.001). As a consequence, Delta N-15 was positive in ED-EX (0.2 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) and remained negative in ED + EX (- 0.6 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand), CON-EX (- 1.0 +/- 0.2) and CON + EX (- 1.1 +/- 0.2). Differences in Delta N-15 were significant between ED-EX and CON-EX (p = 0.005) and ED-EX and CON + EX (p = 0.006). Conclusion Our results suggest that delta N-15(urea) and subsequently Delta N-15 are responsive to a short-term energy deficit, likely due to increased amino acid oxidation to meet energy demands and preferable elimination of N-14.

TI The Genomic Potentials of NOB and Comammox Nitrospira in River
   Sediment Are Impacted by Native Freshwater Mussels
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Freshwater mussel assemblages of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) sequester tons of ammonia- and urea-based biodeposits each day and aerate sediment through burrowing activities, thus creating a unique niche for nitrogen (N) cycling microorganisms. This study explored how mussels impact the abundance of N-cycling species with an emphasis on Candidatus Nitrospira inopinata, the first microorganism known to completely oxidize ammonia (comammox) to nitrate. This study used metagenomic shotgun sequencing of genomic DNA to compare nitrogen cycling species in sediment under a well-established mussel assemblage and in nearby sediment without mussels. Metagenomic reads were aligned to the prokaryotic RefSeq non-redundant protein database using BLASTx, taxonomic binning was performed using the weighted lowest common ancestor algorithm, and protein-coding genes were categorized by metabolic function using the SEED subsystem. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect sizes were used to determine which metagenomes and metabolic features explained the most differences between the mussel habitat sediment and sediment without mussels. Of the N-cycling species deemed differentially abundant, Nitrospira moscoviensis and "Candidatus Nitrospira inopinata" were responsible for creating a distinctive N-cycling microbiome in the mussel habitat sediment. Further investigation revealed that comammox Nitrospira had a large metabolic potential to degrade mussel biodeposits, as evidenced the top ten percent of proteincoding genes including the cytochrome c-type biogenesis protein required for hydroxylamine oxidation, ammonia monooxygenase, and urea decomposition SEED subsystems. Genetic marker analysis of these two Nitrospira taxons suggested that N. moscoviensis was most impacted by diverse carbon metabolic processes while "Candidatus Nitrospira inopinata" was most distinguished by multidrug efflux proteins (AcrB), NiFe hydrogenase (HypF) used in hydrogen oxidation and sulfur reduction coupled reactions, and a heme chaperone (CcmE). Furthermore, our research suggests that comammox and NOB Nitrospira likely coexisted by utilizing mixotrophic metabolisms. For example, "Candidatus Nitrospira inopinata" had the largest potentials for ammonia oxidation, nitrite reduction with NirK, and hydrogen oxidation, while NOB Nitrospira had the greatest potential for nitrite oxidation, and nitrate reduction possibly coupled with formate oxidation. Overall, our results suggest that this mussel habitat sediment harbors a niche for NOB and comammox Nitrospira, and ultimately impacts N-cycling in backwaters of the UMR.

TI Effective catalytic elimination of dichloromethane under humid
   environment over Co-based oxides
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) emitted during waste incineration are major precursors of dioxins. Effective elimination of CVOCs at low temperatures from complex flue gas still has challenges from water resistance. This paper reported a type of cobalt-based catalyst that attained effective catalytic elimination of dichloromethane (DCM) with water-promotive effect. The NH4F-modified CoOx catalyst achieved a DCM conversion of 90% by catalytic ozonation at 120 degrees C with an O3/DCM ratio of 10.0. Interestingly, water addition facilitated DCM transformation and mineralization while suppressed by-products formation, which could endure a high-water content of 12.5 vol%. Similar results were also observed for catalytic oxidation with the same catalyst at higher temperatures. Additionally, synergistic catalytic ozonation of DCM and NO was successfully validated under humid conditions, in which water produced hydroxyl radicals to save O3 and attain enhanced oxidation efficiency. Catalyst characterization revealed that the superior performance of CoOx-UF10 arose from its high reducibility and acidity. The template agent urea and NH4F were responsible for the crystallization and morphological modification of Co, as well as the generation of oxygen vacancies. CoOx inherently possessed excellent H2O activation capabilities, and NH4F modification further enhanced its reducibility and H2O activation properties. The strongly oxidizing O22- and O2- were enriched by water to replenish lattice oxygen and foster the generation of active hydroxyl groups. In situ DRIFTS analysis demonstrated the formation of active OH and OOH groups with the assistance of water, thereby facilitating the complete oxidation of DCM. These findings have significant implications for elimination of CVOCs in industrial flue gas treatment with the co-existence of NO and water vapor.

TI Fertilizer stabilizers reduce nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural
   soil by targeting microbial nitrogen transformations
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a pollutant released from agriculture soils following N fertilizer application. N stabilizers, such as N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) could mitigate these N2O emissions when applied with fertilizer. Here, field experiments were conducted to investigate the microbial mechanisms by which NBPT and DMPP mitigate N2O emissions following urea application. We determined dynamic N2O emissions and inorganic N concentrations for two wheat seasons and combined this with metagenomic sequencing. Application of NBPT, DMPP, and both NBPT and DMPP together with urea decreased mean N2O accumulative emissions by 77.8, 91.4 and 90.7%, respectively, compared with urea application alone, mainly via repressing the increase in NO2- concentration after N fertilization. Sequencing results indicated that urea application enriched microorganisms that were positively correlated with N2O production, whereas N stabilizers enriched microorganisms that were negatively correlated with N2O production. Furthermore, compared to urea application alone, NBPT with urea reduced the abundances of genes related to denitrification, including napA/nasA, nirS/nirK, and norBC, resulting in a higher soil NO3- pool. Conversely, DMPP application, either alone or together with NBPT, decreased the abundance of genes involved in ammonia oxidation and denitrification, including amoCAB, hao, napA/nasA, nirS/nirK, and norBC, and maintained a greater soil NH4+ pool. Both N stabilizers resulted in similar abundances of nirABD-which is related to NO2- reducers-as when no N fertilizer was applied, which could prevent NO2- accumulation, consequently mitigating N2O emissions. These findings suggest that the high effectiveness of N stabilizers on mitigating N2O emissions could be attributed to changes to soil microbial communities and N-cycling functional genes to control the by-product or intermediate products of microbial N-cycling processes in agricultural soils.

TI Bubble-propelled micromotors for ammonia generation
SO NANOSCALE
AB Micromotors have emerged as promising tools for environmental remediation, thanks to their ability to autonomously navigate and perform specific tasks at the microscale. In this study, we present the development of MnO2 tubular micromotors modified with laccase for enhanced oxidation of organic pollutants by providing an additional oxidative catalytic pathway for pollutant removal. These modified micromotors exhibit efficient ammonia generation through the catalytic decomposition of urea, suggesting their potential application in the field of green energy generation. Compared to bare micromotors, the MnO2 micromotors modified with laccase exhibit a 20% increase in rhodamine B degradation. Moreover, the generation of ammonia increased from 2 to 31 ppm in only 15 min, evidencing their high catalytic activity. To enable precise tracking of the micromotors and measurement of their speed, a deep-learning-based tracking system was developed. Overall, this work expands the potential applicability of bio-catalytic tubular micromotors in the energy field.
   Here, we introduce self-propelled biocatalytic micromotors for simultaneous organic pollutant removal and green energy generation. The study demonstrates remarkable results, showcasing the potential to generate ammonia from wastewater in short time.

TI Ni Nanoparticles Decorated NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide as Bifunctional
   Electrochemical Catalyst
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Reducing overpotential and increasing current density remain a great challenge for promoting the application of transition metals-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Herein, Ni nanoparticles (similar to 10 nm) decorated NiFe LDH ultrathin (thickness: similar to 2 nm) nanosheets (Ni NP/NiFe LDH) were successfully synthesized which exhibited advanced electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability on both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The onset potentials for OER and UOR are 1.50 V and 1.34 V, respectively, both are lower than NiFe LDH under the same conditions. Moreover, the peak current density of UOR was 300 mA/cm(2), which is much larger than reported precious-metal free UOR catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance of Ni NP/NiFe LDH composite for OER and UOR is proposed to result from the abundant exposed active sites, small charge transfer resistance, and the synergistic effects between NiFe LDH and anchored Ni nanoparticles. This work provides inspiring ideas and helpful guidelines in design of low-cost but highly efficient electrochemical catalysts. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.

TI Catalytic functionalization of MCM-41 and MCM-48 with copper by modified
   template ion-exchange method for low-temperature NH3-SCR
   process: the role of complexing agents for copper dispersion
SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB Mesoporous silicas of MCM-41 and MCM-48 types were synthesized and modified with copper by template ion-exchange (TIE) technique. A high dispersion of deposited copper species was managed by subsequent treatment of the samples with ammonia, urea, or acetonitrile solution. Copper-modified silicas were analysed in terms of their chemical composition (ICP-OES), ordering of porous structure (XRD), textural parameters (low-temperature N-2 sorption), dispersion and form of introduced copper species (UV-vis-DR, XRD, H-2-TPR, NH3-TPD). Mesoporous silicas modified with copper exhibited promising catalytic efficiency in selective catalytic reduction of NO with ammonia (NH3-SCR). The samples containing dispersed copper species (predominantly monomeric copper cations) presented enhanced catalytic activity compared to catalysts containing CuO aggregates. On the other hand, CuO aggregates showed greater catalytic activity in the side process of direct ammonia oxidation by oxygen present in the reaction mixture. It was demonstrated that TIE post-treatment of the samples with urea resulted in most effective improving dispersion of deposited copper and is less destructive for ordered porous structures of mesoporous silica comparing to treatment with ammonia solution.

They were modified by pre-oxidation, introduction of N-surface groups via impregnation with an aqueous solution of urea and subsequent impregnation with Fe(NO3)(3) or Mn(NO3)(2). The catalysts modified with Fe and Mn showed similar NO conversion, but the former was characterized by better selectivity and stability. The H2O presence in the SCR mixture led to the decrease of NO conversion at low and medium temperature region, which was totally reversible after the removal of water. However, water positively influenced selectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Regulation of Electrocatalytic Activity by Local Microstructure:
   Focusing on the Catalytic Active Zone
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Traditional regulation methods of active sites have successfully optimized the performance of electrocatalysts, but seem unable to achieve further breakthrough in the catalytic activity. Unlike the conventional viewpoint of focusing on single active site, the concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and new methods to regulate the reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions are developed accordingly. The local microstructure active zone refers to the zone with high catalytic activity formed by the interaction between active atoms and neighboring coordination atoms as well as the surrounding environment. Instead of the traditional single active atom site, the active zone is more suitable for the actual electrochemical reaction process. According to this concept, the activity of electrocatalysts can be coordinated by multiple active atoms. This strategy is beneficial for understanding the relationship between material, structure, and catalysis, which realizes the design and synthesis of high-performance electrocatalysts. This review provides the research progress of this strategy for electrocatalytic reactions, with emphasis on their applications in oxygen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction.

TI Electrodeposition of self-supported transition metal phosphides
   nanosheets as efficient hydrazine-assisted electrolytic hydrogen
   production catalyst
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The synthesis of electrocatalysts which used simultaneously as electrodes for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can significantly improve the efficiency of hydrogen production in the water splitting process. Here, Ni-Co-Fe-P binder-free nanosheets were fabricated using the electrochemical deposition method and used as an effective, stable, and cost-effective electrode for hydrazine-assisted electrochemical hydrogen production. Taking advantage of high surface area, being binder-free, and synergistic effect between the elements in the electrode composition, this electrode showed unique electrocatalytic activity and stability. When this electrode was used as a bifunctional electrode for HzOR-HER, a cell voltage of 94 mV was required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The results of this study indicated that the Ni-Co-Fe-P electrode is an excellent candidate for the hydrogen production industry. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Electronic structure modulation and peroxymonosulfate activation
   mechanism of N-doped MnCo2O4: A study on the efficient catalytic
   degradation of sulfamethoxazole
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB In this study, a nitrogen-doped MnCo2O4 composite material (nN-MCO) was successfully synthesized via a urea- assisted thermal treatment method and applied for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade sulfamethoxazole (SMX). By introducing metal-N (M-N) bonds, the concentration of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface and its electron transfer capability with PMS were significantly enhanced. Experimental characterizations demonstrated that nitrogen doping not only strengthened the covalency of the metal-O (M-O) bonds but also facilitated the formation of electron-rich metal sites through electronic rearrangement, further improving the adsorption and activation of PMS. The 2 N-MCO catalyst successfully degraded 98.0 % of SMX within 5 min and maintained a removal efficiency of 85.0 % after four consecutive cycles. The study revealed that 1 O 2 , SO4 center dot-, center dot OH and O 2 center dot- were all involved in the degradation of SMX, with 1 O 2 identified as the dominant reactive oxygen species. This work presents a simple and effective nitrogen-doping strategy for surface modification of spinel-based catalysts, enhancing the MnCo2O4 composite's electronic structure, strengthening metal-oxygen bonds, and creating electron-rich sites. These modifications promote oxygen vacancies, improve electron transfer, and enable efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, offering valuable insights and theoretical support for PMS-based oxidation processes in pollutant treatment.

TI High-performance self-supporting AgCoPO4/CFP for hydrogen
   evolution reaction under alkaline conditions
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Electrochemical water decomposition to produce hydrogen is a promising approach for renewable energy storage. It is vital to develop a catalyst with low overpotential, low cost and high stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions. Herein, we used a simple hydrothermal method to obtain a AgCo(CO)(4) precursor on the surface of carbon fiber paper (CFP). After thermal phosphorization, the self-supporting catalyst AgCoPO4/CFP was obtained, which greatly improved the HER catalytic performance under alkaline conditions. At 10 mA cm(-2), it showed an overpotential of 32 mV. The Tafel slope was 34.4 mV dec(-1). The high catalytic performance of AgCoPO4/CFP may be due to the hydrophilic surface promoting effective contact with the electrolyte and the synergistic effect of the two metals, which accelerated electron transfer and thus promoted hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, it showed an outstanding urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity. After adding 0.5 M urea, the over-potential of the AgCoPO4/CFP assembled electrolytic cell was only 1.45 V when the current density reached 10 mA cm(-2), which was much lower than that required for overall water splitting. This work provides a new method for the design and synthesis of efficient HER electrocatalysts.

TI How much protein can the body use in a single meal for muscle-building?
   Implications for daily protein distribution
SO JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION
AB Controversy exists about the maximum amount of protein that can be utilized for lean tissue-building purposes in a single meal for those involved in regimented resistance training. It has been proposed that muscle protein synthesis is maximized in young adults with an intake of similar to 20-25 g of a high-quality protein; anything above this amount is believed to be oxidized for energy or transaminated to form urea and other organic acids. However, these findings are specific to the provision of fast-digesting proteins without the addition of other macronutrients. Consumption of slower-acting protein sources, particularly when consumed in combination with other macronutrients, would delay absorption and thus conceivably enhance the utilization of the constituent amino acids. The purpose of this paper was twofold: 1) to objectively review the literature in an effort to determine an upper anabolic threshold for per-meal protein intake; 2) draw relevant conclusions based on the current data so as to elucidate guidelines for per-meal daily protein distribution to optimize lean tissue accretion. Both acute and long-term studies on the topic were evaluated and their findings placed into context with respect to per-meal utilization of protein and the associated implications to distribution of protein feedings across the course of a day. The preponderance of data indicate that while consumption of higher protein doses (> 20 g) results in greater AA oxidation, this is not the fate for all the additional ingested AAs as some are utilized for tissue-building purposes. Based on the current evidence, we conclude that to maximize anabolism one should consume protein at a target intake of 0.4 g/kg/meal across a minimum of four meals in order to reach a minimum of 1.6 g/kg/day. Using the upper daily intake of 2.2 g/kg/day reported in the literature spread out over the same four meals would necessitate a maximum of 0.55 g/kg/meal.

TI Carbon materials derived from polymerization of bio-oil as a catalyst
   for the reduction of nitrobenzene
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Bio-oil is a condensable liquid obtained from pyrolysis of biomass, which is the feedstock not only for the production of biofuels, but also for the production of functional carbon materials. In this study, carbon materials derived from the polymerization of bio-oil and furfural were treated with varied methods and were used as catalysts for the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline with hydrazine hydrate as a reductant. The results showed that the oxidation of carbon materials with HNO3 formed more C  O and C  N functionalities, and created some defects, while the doping with urea led to the elimination of the carbonyl functionalities. The presence of N species in the carbon materials changed the electronic state of the carbon atom and induced the skeleton expansion of the graphite structure in the carbon materials, creating remarkably more defect sites than from the oxidation with HNO3. These defective structures were essential for endowing the carbon materials with superior catalytic activity and stability for the selective reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline.

TI Nitrogen doped magnetic porous carbon derived from starch of oatmeal for
   efficient activation peroxymonosulfate to degradation sulfadiazine
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Nitrogen doped magnetic porous carbon catalyst based on starch of oatmeal was obtained by mixing and pyrolysis process, and its catalytic activity of peroxymonosulfate activation for sulfadiazine degradation was evaluated. When ratio of oatmeal/urea/iron was 1: 2: 0.1, CN@Fe-10 had the best catalytic activity to degrade sulfadiazine. Around 97.8 % removal of 20 mg L-1 sulfadiazine was achieved under incorporating of 0.05 g L-1 catalyst and 0.20 g L-1 peroxymonosulfate. Good adaptability, stability and universality of CN@Fe-10 were verified under different conditions. Electron paramagnetic resonance and radical quenching test suggested that surface-bound reactive oxides species and singlet oxygen were the main reactive oxides species in this reaction. Electrochemical analysis indicated that CN@Fe-10 had a good electrical conductivity and electron transferred did occur among CN@Fe-10 surface, peroxymonosulfate and sulfadiazine. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that Fe-0, Fe3C, pyridine nitrogen and graphite nitrogen were the potential active sites for peroxymonosulfate activation. Therefore, the work provided a practical approach for recycling biomass.

TI Whole-body net protein balance plateaus in response to increasing
   protein intakes during post-exercise recovery in adults and adolescents
SO NUTRITION & METABOLISM
AB Background: Muscle protein synthesis and muscle net balance plateau after moderate protein ingestion in adults. However, it has been suggested that there is no practical limit to the anabolic response of whole-body net balance to dietary protein. Moreover, limited research has addressed the anabolic response to dietary protein in adolescents. The present study determined whether whole-body net balance plateaued in response to increasing protein intakes during post-exercise recovery and whether there were age- and/or sex-related dimorphisms in the anabolic response.
   Methods: Thirteen adults [7 males (M), 6 females (F)] and 14 adolescents [7 males (AM), 7 females (AF) within similar to 0.4 y from peak height velocity] performed similar to 1 h variable intensity exercise (i.e., Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test) prior to ingesting hourly mixed meals that provided a variable amount of protein (0.02-0.25 g.kg(-1).h(-1)) as crystalline amino acids modeled after egg protein. Steady-state protein kinetics were modeled noninvasively with oral L-[1-C-13]phenylalanine. Breath and urine samples were taken at plateau to determine phenylalanine oxidation and flux (estimate of protein breakdown), respectively. Whole-body net balance was determined by the difference between protein synthesis (flux - oxidation) and protein breakdown. Total amino acid oxidation was estimated from the ratio of urinary urea/creatinine.
   Results: Mixed model biphasic linear regression explained a greater proportion of net balance variance than linear regression (all, r(2) >= 0.56; P < 0.01), indicating an anabolic plateau. Net balance was maximized at similar to 0.15, 0.12, 0.12, and 0.11 g protein.kg(-1).h(-1) in M, F, AM, and AF, respectively. When collapsed across age, the y-intercept (net balance at very low protein intake) was greater (overlapping CI did not contain zero) in adolescents vs. adults. Urea/creatinine excretion increased linearly (all, r >= 0.76; P < 0.01) across the range of protein intakes. At plateau, net balance was greater (P < 0.05) in AM vs. M.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest there is a practical limit to the anabolic response to protein ingestion within a mixed meal and that higher intakes lead to deamination and oxidation of excess amino acids. Consistent with a need to support lean mass growth, adolescents appear to have greater anabolic sensitivity and a greater capacity to assimilate dietary amino acids than adults.

TI Amorphous conversion in pyrolytic symmetric trinuclear nickel clusters
   trigger trifunctional electrocatalysts
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The pursuit of multifunctional electrocatalysts holds significant importance due to their comprehension of material chemistry. Amorphous materials are particularly appealing, yet they pose challenges in terms of rational design due to their structural disorder and thermal instability. Herein, we propose a strategy that entails the tandem (low-temperature/250-350 degrees C) pyrolysis of molecular clusters, enabling preservation of the local short-range structures of the precursor Schiff base nickel (Ni3[2(C21H24N3Ni1.5O6)]). The temperature-dependent residuals demonstrate exceptional activity and stability for at least three distinct electrocatalytic processes, including the oxygen evolution reaction (eta 10 = 197 mV), urea oxidation reaction (eta 10 = 1.339 V), and methanol oxidation reaction (1358 mA cm-2 at 0.56 V). Three distinct nickel atom motifs are discovered for three efficient electrocatalytic reactions (Ni1 and Ni1 ' are preferred for UOR/MOR, while Ni2 is preferred for OER). Our discoveries pave the way for the potential development of multifunctional electrocatalysts through disordered engineering in molecular clusters under tandem pyrolysis.
   This work elucidates the structural transformation of trinuclear nickel molecular clusters from crystalline to amorphous phases during pyrolysis, Specifically, Ni2, Ni1, and Ni1 ' sites demonstrate selectively enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

TI Palladium-Catalyzed Carbonylation of Amines with Mo(CO)6 as the Carbonyl
   Source
SO ORGANOMETALLICS
AB Catalytic carbonylation of transition metals is widely used as an effective means to synthesize carbonyl-containing compounds. In this article, we introduce a method for the synthesis of N,N '-diphenyl urea and N-phenyl carbamate by transition -metal-catalyzed carbonylation. Here, we use Mo(CO)6 as a safe and stable carbonyl source to introduce the reaction to produce carbonylation products and achieve the selective formation of N,N '-diphenylurea and N-phenylcarbamate under mild conditions. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the reaction proceeded through sequential amine C-H bond activation, carbonyl insertion, nucleophilic attack, and oxidation of Pd(0) with Cu(OAc)2 to generate N-phenyl carbamate and N,N-diphenyl urea products. Moreover, the indenones obtained with Mo(CO)6 as a CO surrogate can be functionalized to form synthetic useful derivatives via an environmentally friendly way.

TI 4-Phenylbutyric acid promotes plant regeneration as an auxin by being
   converted to phenylacetic acid via an IBR3-independent pathway
SO PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4PBA) is utilized as a drug to treat urea cycle disorders and is also being studied as a potential anticancer drug that acts via its histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor activity. During a search to find small molecules that affect plant regeneration in Arabidopsis, we found that 4PBA treatment promotes this process by mimicking the effect of exogenous auxin. Specifically, plant tissue culture experiments revealed that a medium containing 4PBA enhances callus formation and subsequent shoot regeneration. Analyses with auxin-responsive or cytokinin-responsive marker lines demonstrated that 4PBA specifically enhances AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF)-dependent auxin responses. Our western blot analyses showed that 4PBA treatment does not enhance histone acetylation in Arabidopsis, in contrast to butyric acid and trichostatin A, other chemicals often used as HDAC inhibitors, suggesting this mechanism of action does not explain the observed effect of 4PBA on regeneration. Finally, mass spectroscopic analysis and genetic approaches uncovered that 4PBA in Arabidopsis plants is converted to phenylacetic acid (PAA), a known natural auxin, in a manner independent of peroxisomal IBR3-related beta-oxidation. This study demonstrates that 4PBA application promotes regeneration in explants via its auxin activity and has potential applications to not only plant tissue culture engineering but also research on the plant beta-oxidation pathway.

TI Reducing ammonia volatilization from paddy field with rice straw derived
   biochar
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Ammonia (NH3) volatilization is a major loss of nitrogen fertilizer in paddy fields. The incorporation of straw or biochar has been considered to be the alternative options for soil improvement and agriculture sustainability. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential role of rice straw and rice straw derived biochar in controlling NH3 volatilization according to the conventional nitrogen fertilizer level (urea, 270 kg N ha(-1)) during one rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. Xiushui134) growing season. Four treatments comprised rice straw at the rate of 8 t ha(-1) (RS); rice straw derived biochar at the rate of 2.8 t ha(-1) (RSBL); rice straw derived biochar at the rate of 22.5 t ha(-1) (RSBH) and a control (CK). Compared to straw application, biochar incorporation reduced the cumulative NH3 volatilization (about 20%) from paddy fields significantly (p < 0.05), promoted rice yields and plant N aboveground as well as increased the abundance of ammonia oxidation amoA genes. In contrast with the control, the ratios of NH3-N to total N input for RS, RSBL and RSBH declined significantly 4.15%, 4.40% and 11.12%, respectively (p < 0.05). Reduced NH3 volatilization in RSB treatments were mainly attributed to the decrease of NH4+-N concentration in the surface water, which could resulted from the enhancement of rice growth and the promotion of ammonia oxidation in soil. The increase of soil pH and soil CEC with biochar amendment played important roles in nitrogen retention and nitrogen cycle in soil. These results indicated that the incorporation of rice straw derived biochar instead of rice straw could be a promising approach to controlling NH3 volatilization and improving rice yield.

TI Bioavailable Cu can influence nitrification rate in New Zealand dairy
   farm soils
SO JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB Purpose The ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzyme catalyses the first step of ammonia oxidation into hydroxylamine, and copper (Cu) is the main co-factor in its functioning. We hypothesise that bioavailable Cu in soil is a limiting factor for nitrification. An increase in bioavailable Cu will increase nitrification, while a reduction in bioavailable Cu, induced through the application of Cu complexing compounds, will reduce nitrification. Hence, this study aimed to characterise the relationship between bioavailable Cu concentration and nitrification rate in dairy grazed pasture systems. Methods An incubation study was undertaken using three contrasting soils (Pumice, Pallic and Recent soil) and high molecular weight organic acids (HMWOAs). The three soils were spiked with five levels of Cu (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 3 mg kg(-1)) and incubated for 14 days before amendment with treatments. Four treatments were separately applied to each Cu level: urea only (300 mg N kg(-1)), dicyandiamide (DCD) (10 mg kg(-1)) + urea, calcium lignosulphonate (Ca-lig) (120 mg kg(-1)) + urea, and co-poly acrylic-maleic acid (PA-MA) (10 mg kg(-1)) + urea. After 4 and 8 days of incubation, the soil was extracted and analysed for bioavailable Cu and mineral N (nitrate, ammonia) to establish the effect of bioavailable Cu on nitrification rate. The dose response of nitrification rate to Cu was also calculated. Results The nitrification rates at day-8 significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 35%, 22%, and 33% in the Pumice, Pallic, and Recent soils, respectively when the soil added Cu increased from 0.1 to 3 mg kg(-1). Application of Ca-lig and PA-MA significantly (P 0.05) decreased nitrification rate with the mean reduction being 59% and 56%, 32% and 26%, and 39% and 38% in the Pumice, Pallic, and Recent soil, respectively at day-8 relative to the urea-only treatment. Conclusion These results indicated that increasing bioavailable Cu significantly (P 0.05) increased nitrification rate, and suggested that the application of Cu complexing compounds to soil could potentially mitigate the positive effect of soil Cu on nitrification rate and underpin new advances in the development of nitrification inhibitors.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB The use of electrocatalytic technology to replace traditional harsh thermocatalysis in the process of biomass utilization has undoubtedly been an effective means to achieve green and sustainable development. The use of the environmentally friendly method of synthesizing furoic acid (FA) from the biomass platform compound furfural (FF) by electrooxidation was investigated. The surface of the Ni-Co oxide electrode with a Ni content of 0.48 (Ni0.48Co0.36O0.16) obtained by a simple electrodeposition method was covered by a layer of flower-like porous structure, while NiO, Co2+, and Co3+ coexisted. Moreover, the Ni0.48Co0.36O0.16 electrode exhibited 95.4% FA faraday efficiency and 99.6% selectivity with a substrate concentration of 20 mM at 1.0 V vs. Hg/HgO and 50 degrees C. In addition, a mechanism for electrooxidation of FF into FA over a Ni-Co oxide electrode was proposed.

TI Surface construction of nitrogen-doped chitosan-derived carbon
   nanosheets with hierarchically porous structure for enhanced
   sulfacetamide degradation via peroxymonosulfate activation: Maneuverable
   porosity and active sites
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Nitrogen-doped chitosan-derived carbon nanosheets with hierarchically porous structure were synthesized via a facile pyrolysis treatment of chitosan/urea/NaHCO3 mixture (denoted as CNU). The contents of reactive functionalities, graphitization degree and porous structure of CNU can be effectively tailored by pyrolysis temperature (T-p). The outstanding peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-activation ability of CNU800 (prepared at T-p = 800 degrees C) for sulfacetamide (SAM) degradation related to its high level of C = O/C (23.7%) and graphitic N/C (4.8%), relatively high graphitization degree, and its large specific surface area and hierarchically porous structure. The introduction of urea in the presence of NaHCO3 during chitosan pyrolysis facilitated the formation of the graphene-like carbocatalyst with hierarchically porous structure and an enhanced PMS-activating activity. The effect of catalyst loading, PMS dosage and common matrix species on PMS activation by CNU800 for SAM degradation was investigated. Quenching experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance collectively revealed that non-radical oxidation (e.g., singlet oxygen (O-1(2))) was the dominant PMS-activating pathway in the CNU800/PMS/SAM system. The main SAM degradation pathway was also proposed. The conversion between N bonding configurations partially deactivated CNU800. This study deepens the understanding of biomass-based carbocatalyst for environmental remediation.

TI Metal free S-scheme heterojunction S-doped
   g-C3N4/g-C3N4 for enhanced
   photocatalytic water splitting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Using different precursors (urea, thiourea, and urea-thiourea), the S(step)-scheme hetero system i. e. 2D/2D S-doped g-C3N4/g-C3N4 was synthesised by in-situ calcination. Samples that had been prepared were evaluated for water splitting to produce hydrogen in aqueous CH3OH scavenger under exposure of a 300W Xe light. The system consisting of urea and thiourea (1:1 CN-T + U) has exhibited the highest rate of hydrogen production i. e. 485.51 mu molg(-1)h(-1) with 1.75% apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm light irradiation, which is 1.37 and 1.29 times higher than the CN-U and CN-T systems. The S-type heterojunction formed between S-doped g-C3N4 and g-C3N4, is responsible for the higher rate of hydrogen evolution because the heterojunction is more efficient than the typical type-II heterojunction for spatial charge separation and redox ability of the system's oxidation and reduction sites. The photocatalytic electron transfer mechanism based on advanced analysis techniques (XRD, UV-Vis, SEM, EDX, PLE, ESR, XPS, SPV, etc.) was also suggested for the investigated system.

TI LED visible light assisted photo-oxidation of acetaminophen using
   one-step synthesis of Cu, Fe@g-C3N4 nanosheet - Activated persulfate
   system in aqueous solutions
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB In this work, the synthesis of Iron (Fe) and Copper (Cu) co-doped g-C3N4 was per-formed using the thermal decomposition of urea while iron nitrate and copper nitrate were used as dopant precursors. The fabricated catalyst (Fe-Cu@g-C3N4) was coupled with visible light and used for acetaminophen (APAP) degradation. The synthesized catalyst was characterized via several techniques including XRD, BET, BJH, SEM, TEM, EDX, EDS Dot mapping, DLS, and UV-Vis deflective reflectance spectroscopy. The performed characterization tests confirmed the suc-cessful synthesis of Fe-Cu co-doped g-C3N4 with high purity, nano-sheet structure and high poros-ity (79.93 m2/g). The complete APAP decomposition efficiency was achieved under optimal experimental conditions including pH of 11, catalyst dosage of 10 mg/L, PS dosage of 1 mM, and APAP concentration of 4 mg/L. The scavenging tests confirmed the major contribution of sul-fate radicals and consequently, hydroxyl radicals for APAP removal. In addition, the kinetics of APAP degradation was studied and it revealed the pseudo first-order kinetics with 0.0698 min -1 rate constant. Finally, a plausible and tentative decomposition pathway was proposed for APAP degradation. The results of this study confirmed that the LED/catalyst (Cu, Fe@g-C3N4)/PS process could be an efficient and robust process for antibiotic-containing wastewater including hospital wastewater.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI Effects of nitrogen input on soil bacterial community structure and soil
   nitrogen cycling in the rhizosphere soil of Lycium barbarum L.
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Lycium barbarum L., goji berry, is a precious traditional Chinese medicine and it is homology of medicine and food. Its growth is heavily dependent on nitrogen. The use of chemical fertilizers has significantly promoted the yield of goji berry and the development of the L. barbarum L. industry. However, crop plants are inefficient in the acquisition and utilization of applied nitrogen, it often leads to excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers by producers, which cause negatively impact to the environment ultimately. The exploration of an interaction model which deals with crops, chemical fertilizers, and rhizosphere microbes to improve nitrogen use efficiency, is, therefore, an important research objective to achieve sustainable development of agriculture greatly. In our study, we explored the effects of nitrogen input on soil microbial community structure, soil nitrogen cycling, and the contents of nutrients in L. barbarum fruits. The structure and composition of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere soil of L. barbarum were significantly different under different nitrogen supply conditions, and high nitrogen addition inhibited the diversity and stability of bacterial communities. Low nitrogen input stimulated the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), such as Nitrosospira, catalyzing the first step of the ammonia oxidation process. The results of the GLMM model showed that the level of nitrogen fertilizer (urea) input, the relative abundance of AOB, the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium, and their combinations had significant effects on the soil nitrogen cycling and contents of nutrients in L. barbarum fruits. Therefore, we believe that moderately reducing the use of urea and other nitrogen fertilizers is more conducive to improving soil nitrogen use efficiency and Goji berry fruit quality by increasing the nitrogen cycling potential of soil microorganisms.

TI Outstanding Activity and Durability of Supported
   NiCo2O4 Nanoparticles for Direct Ethanol Fuel
   Cells
SO APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB The rational design of noble metal-free electrocatalysts represents one of the basic stones for fuel cell development. With the exploration of eco-friendly nanomaterials for the investigated alcohol oxidation process, nickel-based electrodes have been recognized as the most auspicious anodes with promoted activity and stability. In this work, a series of NiCo(2)O(4)nanoparticles were deposited onto graphite sheets (NiCo2O4/T) introducing varied proportions of cobalt oxide species. Co-precipitation protocol of the respective metallic hydroxides onto the carbonaceous support was followed with consecutive annealing in an air atmosphere at 400 degrees C. The fabricated mixed metallic oxide nanopowder was physically studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Uniformly arranged nanoparticles were observed on graphite surface as evidenced by SEM and TEM. The cubic lattice structure of formed NiCo2O4 crystals was also confirmed by XRD through the defined peaks of binary metallic oxides clarifying their successful preparation scheme. The electrocatalytic properties of these NiCo2O4/T nanocatalysts were evaluated for oxidizing ethanol molecules in basic solution. Pronounced oxidation current densities were remarkably measured at NiCo2O4/T electrodes in relation to that at NiO/T. Differing the introduced cobalt oxide content into the synthesized nanocatalyst significantly controlled its catalytic performance. NiCo2O4/T-20 exhibited the highest activity and stability among the prepared nanomaterials. Much decreased charge transfer resistances were also recorded at this electrode demonstrating its promoted electron transfer characteristics. This work could provide a reasonable route for the simple synthesis of comparable transition metallic oxides with promising attitudes for energy generation purposes.

TI Investigation of Soil Microbial Communities Involved in N Cycling as
   Affected by the Long-Term Use of the N Stabilizers DMPP and NBPT
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Both, 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) are commonly used as nitrogen (N) stabilizers, and are often used in agriculture to reduce nitrogen (N) loss from soils by inhibiting soil nitrification and by slowing down urea hydrolysis, respectively. The current knowledge gap concerns how soil microbial communities involved in N cycling are affected by the long-term use of DMPP and NBPT. The present field study explored the inter-annual variation of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and the responses of ammonia oxidizers (AOA, AOB encoded by the amoA gene), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB, encoded by the nxrA and nxrB genes), and denitrifier (encoded by the narG and nosZ genes) populations following a long-term (8 years) addition of DMPP and NBPT. The results showed that the reduction in N2O emissions by DMPP and NBPT increased year on year. The AOB population diversity significantly increased (p < 0.05) after a long-term urea application but decreased after DMPP addition. The long-term application of urea increased the potential nitrification rate (PNR) by the enrichment of the genera with a high ammonia oxidation capacity in the AOB population. In contrast, DMPP addition weakened this effect and formed a population with a low ammonia oxidation capacity. Variations in the NOB population were mainly associated with fertilizer-induced changes in substrate NO2-, whereas DMPP and NBPT had minor impacts on the NOB population. Additionally, the change in the denitrification population was indirectly affected by the soil ammonium (NH4+) content with a long-term N stabilizer application. These findings provide a new interpretation related to the response mechanisms of the nitrifier and denitrifier populations for the long-term use of N stabilizers in soils.

TI Use of CO as a Cleaning Tool of Highly Active Surfaces in Contact with
   Ionic Liquids: Ni Deposition on Pt(111) Surfaces in IL
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB This work proposes a pretreatment strategy of a flame annealed Pt(111) single crystal ensuring surface ordering and avoiding water surface contamination for experiments in ionic liquid (IL) media. A room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) and a deep eutectic solvent (DES) representative of two families of ionic liquids were selected as test electrolytes: The RTIL used was the 1-ethyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl)sulfonylimide ([Emmim][Tf2N]), and the DES was based on the eutectic mixture of choline chloride (ChCl) and urea (1ChCl:2urea molar ratio). The electrode was flame-annealed and, instead of the water quenching step, it was cooled down in CO atmosphere until the surface was fully covered by a protective carbon monoxide (CO) layer. Prior to experiments, the removal of CO from the surface was performed by electrochemical oxidation. The CO reactivity on Pt(111) was different depending on the IL nature. While CO is easily oxidized to CO2 in [Emmim][Tf2N], in DES, CO remains adsorbed on the substrate and restructures undergoing an order-disorder transition. For both liquids, the proposed method allows for obtaining neat blank cyclic voltammograms, demonstrating that the adsorption of CO is a useful tool to protect the high catalytic surfaces, such as Pt in contact with ILs. To illustrate the feasibility of the CO treatment in electrochemical work with ILs, the general trends for the modification of Pt(111) single crystal surface with metallic nickel nanostructures on both types of IL was investigated. Nickel electrodeposition on the Pt(111) substrate was explored in both [Emmim] [Tf2N] and DES by using classical electrochemical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry, while the deposits were characterized by FE-SEM, EDS, and XPS.

   and photocatalytic applications
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB The aimed research centered on examination of relative activities for cadmium ferrite nanoparticles (CDF-NPs) synthesized by Bio (Tulasi) and Chemical (Urea)-assisted combustion approach. The structural factors of prepared CDF-NPs were measured from major spectral techniques viz XRD, SEM-EDX, FT-IR, etc. X-ray diffraction investigation displays a spinel-cubic phases with crystalline behavior of CDF-NPs, and its average crystallite sizes for U-CDF and T-CDF routes were found to be 38 and 19.4 nm, respectively. The photocatalysts having energy bandgap (Eg) values of 2.64 & 3.19 eV for Tulasi and Urea-mediated CDF-NPs respectively are recorded by UV-Visible absorbance technique monitored from Kubelka-Monk approach. These characterized samples are well suited for photocatalytic action on Rose Bengal (RB) dye degradation, and its degradation efficiencies were observed to be 86.3 and 97.8% at 90 min of synthesized Urea-CDF and Tulasi-CDF photocatalyst respectively on Rose Bengal (RB) dye (40 ppm) by the impact of UV-light. Electrochemical behavior of achieved samples were effectively examined by cyclic voltammeric and electrochemical impedance methods in 1 M KCl. Further, the excellent sensor performance on lead nitrate and paracetamol drug molecules was examined using a prepared CDF NPs-carbon paste electrode at various concentrations of 1-5 mM in 1 M KCl. Tulasi-CDF electrode shows high current density for additional oxidation potential peak appears at 0.01 V and reduction potential peaks at - 0.425 V than those of Urea-CDF electrode. These analysis were revealed that Tulasi-CDF NPs are effective and promising material than those of Urea-CDF for electrochemical sensor and photocatalytic studies.

TI Experimental and COSMO-RS theoretical exploration of rutin formulations
   in natural deep eutectic solvents: Solubility, stability, antioxidant
   activity, and bioaccessibility
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS
AB The present study aimed to estimate the solubility of rutin in twelve natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) and to compare experimental results with the theoretical prediction by the COSMO-RS program. The mandatory component in all investigated systems was choline chloride (ChCl), and the variable component was hydrogen bond donor (HBD), including organic acids, sugars, alcohols, and urea. The FRAP method tested the antioxidant activity of rutin formulations in NADES systems. It was found that theoretical prediction and experimentally determined solubilities of rutin were in excellent agreement. The highest solubility of rutin was observed in 1,2-propanediol (ChCl:1,2PD), 59.30 mg/mL and urea-based systems (ChCl:Ur), 57.99 mg/mL. These systems were further investigated, including dissolution efficiency study, stability to UV and hydrogen-peroxide degradation, and bioaccessibility of rutin by in vitro digestion model. It was found that ChCl:Ur protected rutin against UV-induced oxidation. It was also found that rutin solubilization in ChCl:Ur and ChCl:1,2PD retained rutin for 78.64% and 76.57% in digestive fluids after in vitro digestion and enhanced bioaccessibility compared to the control for more than 60%.

TI A comparison study of photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 prepared from
   different precursors for the activation of different peroxides
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, g-C3N4 catalysts were prepared from six different precursors including urea, melamine and its hydrochloride, dicyandiamide, thiourea, trithiocyanuric acid to compare their photocatalytic performance and the activation of three commonly seen peroxides, i.e., H2O2, peroxymonosulfate (PMS), and peroxydisulfate (PDS) under visible light irradiation. The structural and photoelectric properties were analyzed systematically. Results showed that the g-C3N4 synthesized from trithiocyanuric acid (TCA-CN) showed the largest SSA (56.59 m2/g), the narrowest band gap (2.621 eV), and lowest carriers' recombination rate, which correspondingly exhibited the best photocatalytic performance for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA). Moreover, the g-C3N4 synthesized by urea (U-CN) demonstrating the strongest photoelectron density, widest band gap (2.790 eV) and the most positive VB potential showed the highest activating efficiencies of all three oxidants. In general, persulfates were more competent to enhance the degradation of BPA than H2O2, and PMS showed the highest activity. The dominant reactive oxidation species (ROS) depended more on the type of peroxides than on the catalyst precursors. The effective activation of PDS by U-CN was primarily resulting from the photoelectrons to produce extra & BULL;OH to enhance compounds degradation, and high yield of 1O2 could be achieved by PMS activation through h+ oxidation, leading to the most significant enhancement of BPA removal. The N-C3 and NHx of U-CN were likely the sites for PMS activation. Moreover, the U-CN/LED/PMS process showed the strong adaptability to the complex water environment. This work may provide new insights into selecting highly efficient g-C3N4-based advanced oxidation processes for water remediation.

TI 3-Hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase involved in isoleucine catabolism
   regulates triacylglycerol accumulation in Phaeodactylum
   tricornutum
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Since methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase appears to be absent in the majority of photosynthetic organisms, including diatoms, (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, the intermediate of isoleucine (Ile) catabolism, cannot be metabolized to (R)methylmalonyl-CoA then to succinyl-CoA. In this study, propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) RNAi silenced strains and 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) overexpression strains were constructed to elucidate the Ile degradation pathway and its influence on lipid accumulation in Phaeodactylum tricornutum based on growth, neutral lipid content and metabolite profile analysis. Knockdown of PCC disturbed the metabolism of Ile through propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, as illustrated by much higher Ile content at day 6. However, Ile decreased to comparable levels to the wild-type at day 10. PCC silencing redirected propionyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA via a modified beta-oxidation pathway, and transcript levels for some branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation-related genes, especially HIBCH, significantly upregulated in the PCC mutant, which enhanced the BCAA degradations and thus resulted in higher triacylglycerol (TAG) content. Overexpression of HIBCH accelerates Ile degradation and results in a lowered Ile content in the overexpression strains, thus enhancing carbon skeletons to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and giving rise to increasing TAG accumulation. Our study provides a good strategy to obtain high-lipid-yield transgenic diatoms by modifying the propionyl-CoA metabolism.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'The peculiar carbon metabolism in diatoms'.

TI A Z-scheme Heterojunctional Photocatalyst Engineered with Spatially
   Separated Dual Redox Sites for Selective CO2 Reduction with
   Water: Insight by In situ μs-transient Absorption Spectra
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Solar-driven CO2 reduction by water with a Z-scheme heterojunction affords an avenue to access energy storage and to alleviate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet the separation of charge carriers and the integrative regulation of water oxidation and CO2 activation sites remain challenging. Here, a BiVO4/g-C3N4 (BVO/CN) Z-scheme heterojunction as such a prototype is constructed by spatially separated dual sites with CoOx clusters and imidazolium ionic liquids (IL) toward CO2 photoreduction. The optimized CoOx-BVO/CN-IL delivers an approximate to 80-fold CO production rate without H-2 evolution compared with urea-C3N4 counterpart, together with nearly stoichiometric O-2 gas produced. Experimental results and DFT calculations unveil the cascade Z-scheme charge transfer and subsequently the prominent redox co-catalysis by CoOx and IL for holes-H2O oxidation and electrons-CO2 reduction, respectively. Moreover, in situ mu s-transient absorption spectra clearly show the function of each cocatalyst and quantitatively reveal that the resulting CoOx-BVO/CN-IL reaches up to the electron transfer efficiency of 36.4% for CO2 reduction, far beyond those for BVO/CN (4.0%) and urea-CN (0.8%), underlining an exceptional synergy of dual reaction sites engineering. This work provides deep insights and guidelines for the rational design of highly efficient Z-scheme heterojunctions with precise redox catalytic sites toward solar fuel production.

TI Facile fabrication 1D/2D/3D Co3O4 nanostructure in
   hydrothermal synthesis for enhanced supercapacitor performance
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Adjusting the microstructure is an available strategy to obtain high-performance electrode materials. Herein, we propose a promising and simple hydrothermal method to prepare Co3O4 with improved electrochemical performance by adjusting its microstructure. Co3O4 with different morphologies in the form of band-like, chrysanthemum-like and feather-like can be easily obtained by adjusting the amount of urea in solutions. After analysis, the band-like and feather-like Co3O4 are dominated by surface-control during the oxidation reaction process, while chrysanthemum-like Co3O4 is dominated by diffusion-control during the oxidation reaction process. The experimental results show that the chrysanthemum-like structure of Co3O4 composed of nanowires can be obtained when urea addition is 7 mmol, and it exhibits exciting specific capacity (122.3 mAh g(-1) at 1 A/g) and higher rate capability (70% at 20 A/g). Surprisingly, the specific capacity is still 100% of the initial value after 3000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with activated carbon as anode and Co3O4 as cathode outputs high specific energy (35.3 Wh/kg at 788.8 W/Kg), good cycle stability (capacity retention rate of 82.6% after 10,000 cycles) and excellent coulombic efficiency. These results fully demonstrate that Co3O4 prepared in this work has great potential as an energy storage electrode material.

TI Elevations of C14:1 and C14:2 Plasma Acylcarnitines in Fasted Children:
   A Diagnostic Dilemma
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB Objectives To test whether follow-up testing for very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency uncovers a diagnosis in patients with elevations of C14:1 and C14:2 plasma acylcarnitines after a controlled fasting study performed for clinically suspected hypoglycemia and to compare the acylcarnitine profiles from fasted patients without VLCAD deficiency vs patients with known VLCAD deficiency to determine whether metabolite testing distinguishes these groups.
   Study design We performed a retrospective chart review and identified 17 patients with elevated C14: 1 and C14: 2 plasma acylcarnitine levels after a controlled fast and with testing for VLCAD deficiency (ACADVL sequencing or fibroblast fatty acid oxidation studies). The follow-up testing in all patients was inconsistent with a diagnosis of VLCAD deficiency. We compared the plasma acylcarnitine profiles from these fasted patients vs patients with VLCAD deficiency.
   Results C14: 1/C12:1 was significantly lower (P < .001) in fasted patients vs patients with VLCAD deficiency. Metabolomics analysis performed in 2 fasted patients and 1 patient with VLCAD deficiency demonstrated evidence for up-regulated lipolysis and beta-oxidation in the fasted state.
   Conclusions Elevations of plasma C14: 1 and C14: 2 acylcarnitines appear to be a physiologic result of lipolysis that occurs with fasting. Both metabolomics analysis and/or C14: 1/C12: 1 may distinguish C14: 1 elevations from physiologic fasting-induced lipolysis vs VLCAD deficiency.

TI Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate-conjugated protein-directed synthesis of
   gold nanoclusters for fluorescent ratiometric sensing of an
   enzyme-substrate system
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB This study describes the synthesis of a dual emission probe for the fluorescent ratiometric sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), enzyme activity, and environmental pH change. Green-emitting fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC) was conjugated to the amino groups of bovine serum albumin (BSA). This FITC-conjugated BSA acted as a template for the synthesis of red-emitting gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) under alkaline conditions. Under single wavelength excitation, FITC/BSA-stabilized AuNCs (FITC/BSA-AuNCs) emitted fluorescence at 525 and 670 nm, which are sensitive to changes in solution pH and H2O2 concentration, respectively. The effective fluorescence quenching of AuNCs by H2O2 enabled FITC/BSA-AuNCs to ratiometrically detect the H2O2 product-related enzyme system and its inhibition, including glucose oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of glucose, acetylcholinesterase/choline oxidase-mediated hydrolysis and oxidation of acetylcholine, and paraoxon-induced inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity. When pH-insensitive AuNCs were used as an internal standard, FITC/BSA-AuNCs offered a sensitive and reversible ratiometric sensing of a 0.1-pH unit change in the pH range 5.0-8.5. The pH-induced change in FITC fluorescence enabled FITC/BSA-AuNCs to detect an ammonia product-related enzyme system. This was exemplified with the determination of urea in plasma by urease-mediated hydrolysis of urea. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Recent Advances in Hybrid Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen Production
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Seawater electrolysis (SWE) is a promising and potentially cost-effective approach to hydrogen production, considering that seawater is vastly abundant and SWE is able to combine with offshore renewables producing green hydrogen. However, SWE has long been suffering from technical challenges including the high energy demand and interference of chlorine chemistry, leading electrolyzers to a low efficiency and short lifespan. In this context, hybrid SWE, operated by replacing the energy-demanding oxygen evolution reaction and interfering chlorine evolution reaction (CER) with a thermodynamically more favorable anodic oxidation reaction (AOR) or by designing innovative electrolyzer cells, has recently emerged as a better alternative, which not only allows SWE to occur in a safe and energy-saving manner without the notorious CER, but also enables co-production of value-added chemicals or elimination of environmental pollutants. This review provides a first account of recent advances in hybrid SWE for hydrogen production. The substitutional AOR of various small molecules or redox mediators, in couple with hydrogen evolution from seawater, is comprehensively summarized. Moreover, how the electrolyzer cell design helps in hybrid SWE is briefly discussed. Last, the current challenges and future outlook about the development of the hybrid SWE technology are outlined.
   Hybrid seawater electrolysis, enabled by the anodic oxidation reaction of small molecules or redox mediators substituting for the energy-demanding oxygen evolution reaction, holds substantial promise for energy-saving and cost-effective hydrogen production from seawater without the notorious interfering chlorine evolution, and meanwhile enables either co-production of value-added chemicals or environmental remediation.image

TI Preparation and characterization on the eco-friendly corn starch based
   adhesive of with salient water resistance, mildew resistance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Starch adhesive is a commonly used bonding glue that is sustainable, formaldehyde-free and biodegradable. However, there are obviously some problems related to its high viscosity, poor water and mildew resistance. Hence, exploring a starch-based adhesive with good properties that satisfies the requirements of wood processing presents the context of the current research. Thus, corn starch was used as raw material to form oxidized starch (OCS) via oxidation using sodium periodate, it was reacted with a synthesis polyurea compound that prepared from hexanediamine-urea (HU) obtained by deamination to yield a oxidized starch-hexanediamine-urea adhesive (denoted hereafter as OCSHU). The oxidation process was optimized in terms of oxidant concentration, reaction time and temperature. Furthermore, the impact of HU addition on the mechanical properties of the adhesive was explored. Results indicate adhesive exhibited outstanding shear strength, when 13 % of NaIO4 was used as an oxidant to treat starch at 55 degrees C for 24 h, and involved in a subsequent reaction with 40 % of HU. The dry shear strength, 24 h cold water strength, 3 h hot water strength and 3 h boiling water strength are 1.84, 1.50, 1.32, and 1.31 MPa. Meantime, OCSHU adhesive solution revealed good storage stability whereas cured resin exhibited mildew resistance. The developed adhesive is a simple and green biomass wood adhesive.

TI Structural and Functional Changes of Reconstituted High-Density
   Lipoprotein (HDL) by Incorporation of α-synuclein: A Potent Antioxidant
   and Anti-Glycation Activity of α-synuclein and apoA-I in HDL at High
   Molar Ratio of α-synuclein
SO MOLECULES
AB alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a major culprit of Parkinson's disease (PD), although lipoprotein metabolism is very important in the pathogenesis of PD. alpha-syn was expressed and purified using the pET30a expression vector from an E. coli expression system to elucidate the physiological effects of alpha-syn on lipoprotein metabolism. The human alpha-syn protein (140 amino acids) with His-tag (8 amino acids) was expressed and purified to at least 95% purity. Isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis showed that the isoelectric point (pI) of alpha-syn and apoA-I were pI = 4.5 and pI = 6.4, respectively. The lipid-free alpha-syn showed almost no phospholipid-binding ability, while apoA-I showed rapid binding ability with a half-time (T-1/2) = 8 & PLUSMN; 0.7 min. The alpha-syn and apoA-I could be incorporated into the reconstituted HDL (rHDL, molar ratio 95:5:1:1, palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC):cholesterol:apoA-I:alpha-syn with the production of larger particles (92 & ANGS;) than apoA-I-rHDL (86 and 78 & ANGS;) and alpha-syn-rHDL (65 & ANGS;). An rHDL containing both apoA-I and alpha-syn showed lower alpha-helicity around 45% with a red shift of the Trp wavelength maximum fluorescence (WMF) from 339 nm, while apoA-I-HDL showed 76% alpha-helicity and 337 nm of WMF. The denaturation by urea addition showed that the incorporation of alpha-syn in rHDL caused a larger increase in the WMF than apoA-I-rHDL, suggesting that the destabilization of the secondary structure of apoA-I by the addition of alpha-syn. On the other hand, the addition of alpha-syn induced two-times higher resistance to rHDL glycation at apoA-I:alpha-syn molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2. Interestingly, low alpha-syn in rHDL concentrations, molar ratio of 1:0.5 (apoA-I:alpha-syn), did not prevent glycation with more multimerization of apoA-I. In the lipid-free and lipid-bound state, alpha-syn showed more potent antioxidant activity than apoA-I against cupric ion-mediated LDL oxidation. On the other hand, microinjection of alpha-syn (final 2 mu M) resulted in 10% less survival of zebrafish embryos than apoA-I. A subcutaneous injection of alpha-syn (final 34 mu M) resulted in less tail fin regeneration than apoA-I. Interestingly, incorporation of alpha-syn at a low molar ratio (apoA-I:alpha-syn, 1:0.5) in rHDL resulted destabilization of the secondary structure and impairment of apoA-I functionality via more oxidation and glycation. However, at a higher molar ratio of alpha-syn in rHDL (apoA-I:alpha-syn = 1:1 or 1:2) exhibited potent antioxidant and anti-glycation activity without aggregation. In conclusion, there might be a critical concentration of alpha-syn and apoA-I in HDL-like complex to prevent the aggregation of apoA-I via structural and functional enhancement.

TI Mechanochemical Synthesis of Ethoxyaminohumic Acids and Surface-Active
   Properties of Their Solutions at Solution-Air Interface
SO COLLOID JOURNAL
AB Ethoxyamine derivatives of humic acids have been obtained by mechanochemical synthesis via the simultaneous interaction of humic acids with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-6000 and PEG-1500) and an aminating reagent (urea, hydroperitum, or cyanoguanidine) in a vibrating apparatus. Reaction products have been characterized by IR spectroscopy, acid-base potentiometric titration, and viscometry. Tensiometric and rheological characteristics of the surface layers of solutions of salts of the synthesized derivatives of humic acids have been studied by the pendant drop and oscillating pendant drop methods. The solutions of the salts of ethoxyaminohumic acids have been found to exhibit a pronounced surface activity at the air-water interface. The experimental dependences of the viscoelastic modulus on the surface pressure and the concentration of the solutions of ethoxyaminohumic acid salts are in satisfactory agreement with the functions calculated in terms of the theoretical model of bimolecular adsorption. The presence of amino groups in the structure of ethoxyaminohumic acids predetermines their high solubility in the acidic pH region. The simultaneous incorporation of ethoxy and amino groups into humic acid macromolecules makes it possible to obtain a novel type of surfactants, which combine three functions, i.e., the functions of anionic, cationic, and nonionic surfactants.

   for the CO-PrOx reaction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this study, we present a method for directly coating monoliths with a CeO2/CuO catalyst using the urea-nitrate combustion method. The catalyst was characterized by means of XRD, SEM/EDX, and EPR measurements. Experimental results are described, when this catalyst was used for the preferential oxidation of CO. The catalytic activity for the CO-PrOx-reaction was measured by recording CO conversion as a function of the reaction temperature in a hydrogen-rich gas mixture in the presence and absence of water vapor. In a long-term test of over 310 h, the catalyst's long-term stability was demonstrated. Direct coating is shown to be a promising approach by which a larger amount of catalyst can be deposited onto the monolith in a single step than would be possible with washcoats.

TI Quantum Chemical Evaluation of Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Extractive
   Desulfurization of Fuel
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Sulfur compounds in fuels are converted to SOx during combustion, poisoning automotive catalytic converters and creating serious environmental concerns (e.g., acid rain). The efficient desulfurization of liquid fuel is thus a critical step toward minimizing SOx emissions and their associated environmental impact. To address this problem, governments worldwide have passed stringent legislation regulating the maximal sulfur levels allowable in fuels. In the petroleum refining industry, the conventional method for removing sulfur from fuel is catalytic hydrodesulfurization which, while highly efficient for removing mercaptans, thioethers, and disulfides, shows limited performance in removing aromatic organosulfur compounds exemplified by dibenzothiophene. To meet these strict environmental targets, innovative strategies beyond hydrodesulfurization for the deep desulfurization of fuel are sought. One key strategy entails the oxidation of refractory organosulfur compounds in liquid fuel, coupled with efficient liquid/liquid extraction of the oxidized sulfur compounds using an immiscible solvent phase (i.e., oxidative desulfurization). In this study, we employ computational chemistry to gain atomistic-level insight into the specific interactions responsible for the extraction of key organosulfur compounds and their oxidation products from fuel using deep eutectic solvents (DESs). Specifically, we perform quantum chemical calculations involving the well-studied DESs reline (1:2 choline chloride:urea) and ethaline (1:2 choline chloride:ethylene glycol) to characterize the intermolecular interactions, charge transfer behavior, and thermodynamics associated with their application for organosulfur extraction. We observe that the model aromatic sulfur compounds (ASCs) benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene interact with choline and the hydrogen bond donor (HBD; i.e., urea or ethylene glycol) of the DES via a plurality of weak noncovalent interactions. However, the chloride ion is essentially noninteractive with the ASC due to retention of the conventional hydrogen bond network existing within the initial DES. Oxidation of the model ASCs to their respective sulfoxide and sulfone products was shown to enhance interactions with the DES components, particularly the HBD species due to its propensity for forming multiple hydrogen bonds. We further demonstrate that, upon oxidation, the ASCs exhibit significant and favorable free energies of solvation, suggesting that oxidation will aid in the partition of these sulfur compounds from liquid fuel to a conventional DES phase.

TI Highly Graphitic, Mesoporous Carbon Materials as Electrocatalysts for
   Vanadium Redox Reactions in All-Vanadium Redox-Flow Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Two new commercially available mesoporous graphitic carbon materials were oxygen-functionalized with 0.2 M potassium permanganate solution, 10 M nitric acid and a mixture of water, nitric and sulfuric acid in a ratio of 1:2:1, respectively. Heat treatment of the oxidized samples in the presence of urea as a nitrogen precursor at 800 degrees C yielded nitrogen-containing surface functional groups. Functionalized samples are compared to the pristine materials with respect to structure and morphology using TGA, Raman spectroscopy, TEM and XPS. The degree of oxygen functionalization depends on the oxidation agent and is different for both materials. There is a weak correlation between the amount of oxygen functional groups and the amount of nitrogen implemented during urea treatment, with thermally more stable C-O oxygen groups leading to enhanced nitrogen incorporation. The samples show a considerable structural inhomogeneity as observed from Raman spectroscopy in a mapping mode collecting 300 spectra. Electrocatalytic activity toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox pair was determined by CV. The electrocatalytic activity of the materials is significantly increased after functionalization, however, surprisingly independent from the degree of functionalization. On the other hand, carbon structural properties seem to have a significant impact on activity. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

TI Pyruvate-Carboxylase-Mediated Anaplerosis Promotes Antioxidant Capacity
   by Sustaining TCA Cycle and Redox Metabolism in Liver
SO CELL METABOLISM
AB The hepatic TCA cycle supports oxidative and biosynthetic metabolism. This dual responsibility requires anaplerotic pathways, such as pyruvate carboxylase (PC), to generate TCA cycle intermediates necessary for biosynthesis without disrupting oxidative metabolism. Liver-specific PC knockout (LPCKO) mice were created to test the role of anaplerotic flux in liver metabolism. LPCKO mice have impaired hepatic anaplerosis, diminution of TCA cycle intermediates, suppressed gluconeogenesis, reduced TCA cycle flux, and a compensatory increase in ketogenesis and renal gluconeogenesis. Loss of PC depleted aspartate and compromised urea cycle function, causing elevated urea cycle intermediates and hyperammonemia. Loss of PC prevented diet-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance but depleted NADPH and glutathione, which exacerbated oxidative stress and correlated with elevated liver inflammation. Thus, despite catalyzing the synthesis of intermediates also produced by other anaplerotic pathways, PC is specifically necessary for maintaining oxidation, biosynthesis, and pathways distal to the TCA cycle, such as antioxidant defenses.

TI Photocatalytic oxidation of diuron using nickel organic xerogel under
   simulated solar irradiation
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In this study, a nickel organic xerogel (X-Ni) was used as semiconductor photocatalyst for the degradation of the herbicide diuron (DRN) in aqueous solution. The main objective of this work was to analyze and compare the effectiveness of solar irradiation to remove DRN from water both by direct photolysis and photocatalytic degradation. We examined the influence of the initial concentration of the herbicide, the solution pH, the presence of different ions in the medium, the chemical composition of the water, and the presence of a photocatalyst, after 240 min of irradiation. Direct photolysis achieved a low percentage of DRN degradation but was favored: i) by a reduction in the initial concentration of the herbicide (from 35.6% to 79.0% for 0.150 x 10(-3) mol/L and 0.021 x 10(-3) mol/L of DRN, respectively) and ii) at solution pHs at which diuron is positively charged (78.6% for pH 2 and 50.4% for pH 7), as suggested by DFT calculations carried out for DRN and its protonated form (DRN-H+). The corresponding mono-demethylated DRN derivative, 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methylurea (DCPU), was identified as a DRN degradation by product. In addition, the presence of certain anions in the medium significantly affected the overall degradation process by direct photolysis, due to the additional generation of HO center dot radicals. We highlight that the presence of X-Ni considerably improved the photodegradation process under solar irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation rate constant was directly proportional to the xerogel concentration, because an increase in catalyst dose produced an increase in surface active sites for the photodegradation of DRN, enhancing the overall efficiency of the process. Thus, when 4167 mg/g of X-Ni was added, the DRN removal rate was 3-fold higher and both percentage of degradation and mineralization increased 88.5% with respect to the results obtained by direct photolysis.

TI Simultaneous soot combustion and NOx reduction over a
   vanadia-based selective catalytic reduction catalyst
SO COMPTES RENDUS CHIMIE
AB Simultaneous NOx reduction and soot combustion over a commercial vanadia-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst were investigated. Carbon black was used as model soot. The impact of the contact intensity between carbon and catalyst was studied. The experiments appeared as promising results for the utilization of vanadia-based SCR catalysts in SCR on filter system as, in the SCR operating temperature range (250-400 degrees C), no significant impact of the presence of carbon black on NOx reduction was observed. However, a decrease in the specific carbon oxidation rate was highlighted. This latter increases with the contact between carbon and catalyst and is attributed to a lack of NO2, consumed by the fast SCR reaction. At temperatures greater than 400 degrees C, the contact between carbon particles and the SCR catalyst partially inhibits the NOx reduction, whereas it exhibits a catalytic effect on the carbon oxidation rate. The tighter the contact between the two materials, the more significant is this behavior. A redox mechanism, which competes with the redox cycle of the SCR mechanism, was proposed. The impregnation of a V-based SCR catalyst with 2 wt % of calcium was also performed. A drastic loss of DeNO(x) activity was observed, whereas the effect of the contact between carbon and catalyst was reduced. (C) 2017 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI New insights about the effect of the synthesis method on the
   CuO-CeO2 redox properties and catalytic performance towards
   CO-PROX reaction for fuel cell applications
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The preferential oxidation of CO (CO-PROX) is promoted at the interface between CuO and CeO2. For this reason, different synthesis methods of CuO/CeO2 catalysts have been investigated in order to maximize this interface. However, the understanding of the effect of CuO/CeO2 catalysts preparation method on the redox properties and CO-PROX reaction performance is still unclear. In the present work, 2 wt% CuO/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by four synthesis methods, namely co-precipitation with ammonium hydroxide (CP), deposition precipitation with ammonium hydroxide (DA) or urea (DU), and impregnation (IM). The materials were characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, H-2-TPR, REDOX cycles, N2O passivation and applied to the CO-PROX reaction. The catalytic performance of the investigated materials was evaluated by the TOF values of CO oxidation. CuCe (CP) and CuCe (DU) catalysts were the most stable in terms of redox properties and the most active in the CO-PROX reaction. On the other hand, the CuCe (DA) catalyst presented the least stable behaviour during the redox cycles and the worst performance in CO-PROX reaction, These results clearly show that the stability of the CuO/CeO2 interface, submitted to successive redox cycles, plays a significant role towards the CO-PROX reaction and that this stability depends on the employed synthesis method.

TI Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework- Derived Core- Shell- Structured CoS2/
   CoS2- N- C Supported on Electrochemically Exfoliated Graphene Foil for
   Efficient Oxygen Evolution
SO BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS
AB Developing earth- abundant transition- metal based materials to efficiently catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an urgent demand for electrochemical water splitting and rechargeable metal- air batteries. Here, we developed a novel 3D hybrid electrocatalyst consisting of core- shell structured CoS2/ CoS2 embedded into N- doped carbon supported on electrochemically exfoliated graphene foil (EG/ CoS2/ CoS2- NC) by sulfurization treatment of EG/ Co(OH) 2/ zeolitic imidazolate framework- 67 (ZIF- 67) as precursor. The thickness of the CoS2- NC shell derived from ZIF- 67 is 10 nm and the CoS2 core generated from Co(OH) 2 nanosheet arrays has a particle size of 20 nm. Benefiting from the unique 3D core- shell structure and synergistic effects, the EG/ CoS2/ CoS2- NC hybrid enormously promotes electrocatalytic OER activity with a low overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm 2 and a small Tafel slope of 61.9 mVdec 1. These values are far superior compared to the commercial Ir/ C catalyst, and even better than other reported state- of- the- art CoS2- based materials. In- situ Raman spectroscopy together with ex- situ XRD patterns reveal that the active centers of EG/ CoS2/ CoS2- NC hybrid are proven to be Co- OOH species that are derived from Co S groups during the OER process. The superb catalytic performance is also reflected in boosting electrochemical urea oxidation and hydrazine oxidation, where the accelerated oxidation reaction could be observed.

TI Deep eutectic solvent for curing of phthalonitrile resin: Lower the
   curing temperature but improve the properties of thermosetting
SO HIGH PERFORMANCE POLYMERS
AB Long curing duration and high curing temperature are commonly known to restrict the application of the phthalonitrile resin. In this study, a deep eutectic solvent (DES) containing ZnCl2 and urea has been developed to improve the curing process of the resorcinol-based phthalonitrile resin (DPPh) without sacrificing the useful properties of the resin. For the molar ratio of ZnCl2 and urea as 1:1 (ZnCl2-urea (1-1)), the initial curing temperature and apparent activation energy of the system were recorded as 179.5 degrees C and 90.1 kJ/mol, respectively, indicating a reduction of 31.2% and 39.0% as compared to the pristine ZnCl2 system. More importantly, with curing time of 6 h and post-curing temperature of 300 degrees C, the temperature at 5% weight loss as well as glass transition temperature of the resin with DES as the curing agent were 523.1 degrees C and 370.2 degrees C, respectively, demonstrating a significant improvement as compared to the resin cured with ZnCl2. In addition, the satisfactory long-term oxidation stability of the resin could also be obtained by employing the new curing agent. The findings from this study open a functional pathway for facile preparation of the high-performance curing agent for the phthalonitrile resin.

TI Long-term fertilization regimes change soil nitrification potential by
   impacting active autotrophic ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers as
   assessed by DNA stable isotope probing
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizers and nitrite-oxidizers are responsible for a significant amount of soil nitrate production. The identity and composition of these active nitrifiers in soils under different long-term fertilization regimes remain largely under-investigated. Based on that soil nitrification potential significantly decreased in soils with chemical fertilization (CF) and increased in soils with organic fertilization (OF), a microcosm experiment with DNA stable isotope probing was further conducted to clarify the active nitrifiers. Both ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) were found to actively respond to urea addition in soils with OF and no fertilizer (CK), whereas only AOB were detected in soils with CF. Around 98% of active AOB were Nitrosospira cluster 3a.1 in all tested soils, and more than 90% of active AOA were Nitrososphaera subcluster 1.1 in unfertilized and organically fertilized soils. Nitrite oxidation was performed only by Nitrospira-like bacteria in all soils. The relative abundances of Nitrospira lineage I and VI were 32% and 61%, respectively, in unfertilized soils, and that of Nitrospira lineage II was 97% in fertilized soils, indicating long-term fertilization shifted the composition of active Nitrospira-like bacteria in response to urea. This finding indicates that different fertilizer regimes impact the composition of active nitrifiers, thus, impacting soil nitrification potential.

   inside Quartz Nanopipettes
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Carbon nanopipettes (CNPs) have attracted much attention in nanoscale electrochemical applications recently, while the carbon structure and surface oxygen-containing groups limit its applications. Herein, we grow the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) inside the quartz nanopipet via the chemical vapor deposition method, and the fabricated carbon nanotube nanopipettes (CNT-NPs) exhibit better electrochemical responses toward biomolecules such as glutathione and ascorbic acid, compared to the conventional CNPs. In addition, the carbon nanopipette can also be easily doped by a chemical reaction with urea, to display positive surface charges and high electrochemical activity for H2O2 oxidation/reduction. This work provides an easy way to tailor the surface structure and charges of the deposited carbon inside the pipettes and thus would further promote its broader usage in electrochemical sensing applications in biological fields.

TI Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as an efficient
   metal-free Fenton-like catalyst for degrading organic pollutants: the
   overlooked non-photocatalytic activity
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted a large amount of research, mainly being used as a photocatalyst, but its Fenton-like catalytic performance has been overlooked. In this paper, the dark Fenton-like catalytic performance of g-C3N4 was evaluated by degrading rhodamine B over a wide pH range. The results showed that the g-C3N4, which was synthesized by conventional urea pyrolysis without any modification, was an efficient metal-free heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst. The highest activity occurred under a weakly alkaline condition of about pH 10. The experiment of catalyst recycling indicated that g-C3N4 had long-term stability. The reactive oxidizing species of HO center dot, generated by the g-C3N4 activating H2O2, was identified by EPR and further supported by a scavenging experiment of HO center dot using isopropanol as the scavenger. The HNO3 oxidation of g-C3N4 resulted in catalytic deactivation, implying the catalytic activity originated from the surface reduced groups of g-C3N4. The structure of synthesized g-C3N4 before and after the HNO3 oxidation was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a possible catalytic mechanism was proposed.

TI Monocationic Cinchoninium Catalyzed Asymmetric Oxohydroxylation of
   Enoates
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB Asymmetric dihydroxylation and epoxidation are well-developed and widely used approaches to introduce chiral oxygenated functional groups with an alkene substrate. However, oxohydroxylation of an alkene, furnishing adjacent oxo and hydroxy groups, is less explored. In this paper, asymmetric oxohydroxylation of alpha-alkyl enoates with potassium permanganate catalyzed by monocationic quaternary ammonium salts derived from cinchona alkaloid is reported. A series of alpha-hydroxy-beta-keto esters were obtained in up to 96% yield and 98% ee under user-friendly conditions. Synthetic application of oxohydroxylation was demonstrated in the synthesis of key chiral building blocks for thapsigargin and camptothecin synthesis. Control experiments indicated that, compared with tetrabutylammonium, monocationic chiral cinchoninium has a dramatic rate acceleration effect on catalytic permanganate oxidation.

TI Catalytic Behaviour of CuO-CeO2 Systems Prepared by Different
   Synthetic Methodologies in the CO-PROX Reaction under
   CO2-H2O Feed Stream
SO CATALYSTS
AB CuO-CeO2 catalysts, with 6 wt % of Cu, have been synthesised by different preparation methods (calcination of nitrate precursors, thermal urea-nitrate combustion, freeze-drying method, using polymethyl metacrylate PMMA microspheres as template and precipitation using NaOH or the decomposition of urea as precipitating agents). The obtained materials have been characterised by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption at -196 degrees C, H-2 thermoprogrammed reduction (H-2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalysts displayed high dispersion of copper oxide, obtaining CO conversion values of 90-100% at 115 degrees C in the CO preferential oxidation in excess of hydrogen (CO-PROX) and maintaining this activity even after 48 h of time on stream. The incorporation of CO2 and H2O in the feed stream (simulating a PROX unit) caused a decrease in the CO conversion, except for the catalyst synthesised using PMMA microspheres as a template which maintained a CO conversion of 95% at 115 degrees C. This catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic performance, also under real operating conditions, thanks to many and concomitant factors, such as the very small CeO2 particle size (5.6 nm), the surface being rich in copper (atomic ratio Cu/Ce = 0.35) that is easily reducible, and the peculiar morphology and porosity of the material.

TI Enantioselective Synthesis of (R)-Sitagliptin via Phase-Transfer
   Catalytic aza-Michael Addition
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The highly enantioselective synthesis of (R)-sitagliptin has been achieved through a series of key steps, including the aza-Michael addition and Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. The enantioselective aza-Michael addition involved the reaction of tert-butyl beta-naphthylmethoxycarbamate with (E)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)but-2-en-1-one, utilizing a quinine-derived C(9)-urea ammonium catalyst under phase-transfer catalytic conditions. The aza-Michael addition successfully introduced chirality to the amine in (R)-sitagliptin with 96% ee. The subsequent Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of the aza-Michael adduct led to the formation of 4-methoxyphenyl ester. Hydrolysis and amide coupling were then employed to construct the amide moiety. Further deprotections were performed to complete the synthesis of (R)-sitagliptin (7 steps, 41%, 96% ee).

TI Efficient catalytic removal of COS and H2S over graphitized 2D
   micro-meso-macroporous carbons endowed with ample nitrogen sites
   synthesized via mechanochemical carbonization
SO GREEN ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT
AB Developing a suitable catalyst for the elimination of highly toxic carbonyl sulfide (COS) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is of great significance in terms of industrial safety and environmental protection. We demonstrate here the facile synthesis of graphitized 2D micro-meso-macroporous carbons by one-step carbonization of a mixture of urea and glucose at 700-900 degrees C. The as-synthesized graphitized catalysts, designated as 2DNHPC-x (x = urea/glucose mass ratio), are endowed with an ultra-high concentration (12.9-20.2 wt%) of stable and versatile nitrogen sites (e.g. pyrrole and pyridine) which are anchored on the surface via stable covalent bonding. As a result, the 2D-NHPC-x are active in catalytic hydrolysis of COS on pyrrolic N to H2S, and the H2S can be subsequently captured on pyridinic N and converted to elemental sulfur at ambient conditions over the same materials. Among the prepared catalysts, 2D-NHPC-x can catalytically hydrolysize 91% of COS to H2S at 30 degrees C, whereas the conversion ratio over the common catalysts g-C3N4 and Fe2O3 are below 6.0%. Furthermore, these catalysts also exhibit H2S conversion and sulfur selectivity of nearly 100% at 180 degrees C with long-time durability, which is higher than those of the most reported carbonbased catalysts. In contrast, the H2S capacities of activated carbon, ordered mesoporous carbons (OMC) and N-doped OMC are 3.9, 1.5 and 2.39 mmol g-1, respectively. Both the experimental and theoretical results are disclosed that 2D-NHPC-x are superior to the nitrogen-doped porous materials ever applied in simultaneous catalytic elimination of both COS and H2S.

TI Enhancing catalytic performance of Ag-CeO2 catalysts for
   catalytic CO combustion: Ag-CeO2 interface interaction and
   Na-promoting action
SO FUEL
AB Ag-CeO2 catalysts were prepared via urea-and activated carbon-assisted pyrolysis to study an improvement strategy for their catalytic performance in catalytic CO combustion. Different synthetic methods induced the change of Ag-CeO2 interface interaction by tuning the surface chemical state of Ag nanoparticles and CeO2 nanoparticles. However, it was completely different to arouse the change degree in the structure and perfor-mance of these Ag-CeO2 catalysts. Fabrication of Ag-CeO2 catalysts using a urea pyrolysis induced to create an Ag-CeO2 interface with more metallic Ag species, which improved the reductivity of CeO2 surface and enhanced the Ag-CeO2 catalyst performance. Fabrication of Ag-CeO2 catalysts using an activated carbon pyrolysis method induced to form an Ag-CeO2 interface with more positively charged Ag+ ions and required higher temperature of CO conversion. For the Ag-CeO2 catalysts with more positively charged Ag+ species, the participation of sodium salts could alleviate Ag nanoparticle oxidation and promoted the transformation of Ag-CeO2 interface with more positively charged Ag+ ions into Ag-CeO2 interface with more metallic Ag species, which caused the formation of more Ce3+ cations and the production of more reducible surface oxygen and enhanced the catalyst performance in catalytic CO combustion.

TI Electrochemical degradation of antivirus drug lamivudine formulation:
   photoelectrocoagulation, peroxi-electrocoagulation, and
   peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation processes
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB This study evaluates the performance of photoelectrocoagulation, peroxi-electrocoagulation, and peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation for the removal of the antiviral drug lamivudine formulation from wastewater by a stainless-steel electrode. To investigate matrix effects for this oxidation process, the influence of substrates such as urea and simulated wastewater (SWW) was studied. Moreover, degradation kinetics and energy efficiency are also discussed. Results indicate that the removal efficiency was in the order of peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation > peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation (in the presence of urea) > peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation (in the presence of SWW) > peroxi-electrocoagulation > photoelectrocoagulation. In peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation, the 96% degradation of lamivudine formulation indicates a nearly complete degradation of lamivudine. In this process, the presence of urea and SWW resulted in a substantial reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) decay. Kinetic studies using linear pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics showed that the pseudo-first-order equation effectively described the removal of lamivudine formulation. The highest energy consumption per kgCOD decay (i.e., kWh kgCOD(- 1)) was obtained for the photoelectrocoagulation process, while the lowest energy consumption was obtained for peroxi-electrocoagulation, for all electrolysis times. The peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation process was shown to be an effective and energy-efficient technique for removing the antiviral drug lamivudine formulation from wastewater.

TI In-situ expressions of comammox Nitrospira along the
   Yangtze River
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The recent discovery of comammox Nitrospira as complete nitrifiers has significantly enriched our under-standing on the nitrogen cycle, yet little is known about their metabolic transcripts in natural aquatic ecosystems. Using the genome-centric metatranscriptomics, we provided the first in-situ expression pat-terns of comammox Nitrospira along the Yangtze River. Our study confirmed widespread expressions of comammox Nitrospira, with the highest transcription accounting for 33.3% and 63.8% of amoA and nxrAB genes expressed in ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes (AOPs) and Nitrospira sublineages I/II, respectively. Moreover, comammox two clades differed in nitrification, with clade A acting as the dominator to am-monia oxidation in comammox, and clade B contributing more transcripts to nitrite oxidation than to ammonia oxidation. Compared to canonical Nitrospira, comammox community had lower expressions of ammonia/nitrite transporters and nitrogen assimilatory genes, but far higher expressions in urea trans-port and hydrolysis, facilitating to derivation of ammonia and energy mainly through intracellular ure-olytic metabolism. This suggests no need for "reciprocal-feeding" between canonical Nitrospira and AOPs in a natural river. Aerobic mixotrophy of comammox bacteria was suggested by expressions of genes coding for respiratory complexes I-V, oxidative/reductive TCA cycle, oxygen stress defenses, and trans-port/catabolism of simple carbohydrates and low-biosynthetic-cost amino acids. Intriguingly, significant positive correlations among expressions of ammonia monooxygenases, hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and copper-dependent nitrite reductase indicated that comammox Nitrospira had the potential of converting nitrite to nitric oxide accompanied by ammonia oxidation under low-C/N and aerobic conditions, while gene expressions in this pathway were significantly and positively associated with pH. Overall, this study illustrated novel transcriptional characteristics of comammox Nitrospira, and highlighted the necessity of reassessing their contributions to biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycling with perspective of in-situ meta-omics as well as culture experiments.

TI Protective effects of Avena sativa against oxidative
   stress-induced kidney damage resulting from an estrogen deficiency in
   ovariectomized Swiss mice model
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of Avena sativa and to confirm its protective effects on estrogen deficiency in ovariectomized mice (OVX) model. Animals were treated during 21 and 60 days as follows: negative control, positive control treated with oat, ovariectomized, and ovariectomized receiving hormonal or oat treatments, respectively. 21 days post-surgery, our results showed that ovariectomy increases weight gain and urea level in plasma. After 60 days of treatment, OVX showed a gain in weight, high increases in relative kidney weight, plasmatic creatinine, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, and protein oxidation as shown by elevated protein carbonyl (PCO) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels. On the other side, a decrease was detected in catalase activity. Meanwhile, no significant changes in urea level, lipid peroxidation, SOD and GSH activity were detected. Conversely, supplementation with oat reduced weight gain, as well as oxidative stress and oxidation protein in the kidney of OVX mice.
   Practical applications In our study, we removed the two ovaries of adult female mice in order to eliminate the essential source of steroid hormones. Deficiency in these sexual hormones, especially estrogen, leads to several physiological and morphological disturbances that are found in post-menopausal women. The gain in weight and oxidative kidney damages were the main health problems detected in ovariectomized animals. This work explored for the first time the use of oat grains as a safe natural remedy to treat all previous health problems and to avoid carcinogenic effects of the menopausal hormone therapy. Owing to its health benefits, this cereal species has recently gained attention as an important source of antioxidants and fibers. Thanks to these two components, it can be able to restore all indicated disturbances. Therefore, this cereal can be very useful in the prevention of obesity and kidney oxidative damage occurring during menopause.

TI Aminocoumaranones as Chemiluminescence Indicators of the Urease Activity
   and Hydrogen Peroxide
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Objective: The phenomenon of chemiluminescence - the emission of light by a substance after oxidation - has been known for a very long time. Substances capable of chemiluminescence are actively used for the detection and quantitative determination of a wide variety of analytes. In this work, we studied the possibility of using 3-amino-coumaranones for the detection of hydrogen peroxide and urease activity study. Methods: In this work, we synthesized a series of 3-amino-coumaran-2-one derivatives, which can be divided into two groups: amide derivatives and urea derivatives. The optical and chemiluminescent properties of all the obtained compounds were studied under various conditions. Results and Discussion: In this work, a series of 3-amino-coumaranones was synthesized. It has been found that amide derivatives and derivatives of asymmetrically substituted ureas have significant chemiluminescence under various conditions. The introduction of the electron-donor groups in the coumaranone moiety and increasing of the conjugated pi-system of coumaranones allow to shift 30-40 nm of the chemiluminescence maxima to the long-wavelength region. For N,N-disubstituted unsymmetrical urea derivatives it is shown that the luminescence intensity can be different under various conditions. It has been shown that derivatives of N,N-disubstituted unsymmetrical ureas can be used for the determination of hydrogen peroxide, and some compounds, due to their bright luminescence in the presence of urease, can be used as indicators of its enzymatic activity. Conclusions: We showed that some 3-amino-coumaranones can be used for detecting the urease and hydrogen peroxide.

TI Nitrate increases the capacity of an aerobic moving-bed biofilm reactor
   (MBBR) for winery wastewater treatment
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We used bench-scale tests and mathematical modeling to explore chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates in a moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) for winery wastewater treatment, using either urea or nitrate as a nitrogen source. With urea addition, the COD removal fluxes ranged from 34 to 45 gCOD/m(2)-d. However, when nitrate was added, fluxes increased up to 65 gCOD/m(2)-d, twice the amount reported for aerobic biofilms for winery wastewater treatment. A one-dimensional biofilm model, calibrated with data from respirometric tests, accurately captured the experimental results. Both experimental and modelling results suggest that nitrate significantly increased MBBR capacity by stimulating COD oxidation in the deeper, oxygen-limited regions of the biofilm. Our research suggests that the addition of nitrate, or other energetic and broadly used electron acceptors, may provide a cost-effective means of covering peak COD loads in biofilm processes for winery or another industrial wastewater treatment.

TI Advances in the molecular mechanisms of statins in regulating
   endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability: Interlocking biology between
   eNOS activity and L-arginine metabolism
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A, are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia. In addition, statins have been suggested to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events owing to their pleiotropic effects on the vascular system, including vasodilation, anti-inflammation, anti-coagulation, anti-oxidation, and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. The major beneficial effect of statins in maintaining vascular homeostasis is the induction of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability by activating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in endothelial cells. The mechanisms underlying the increased NO bioavailability and eNOS activation by statins have been well-established in various fields, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, kinasedependent phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. However, the mechanism by which statins affect the metabolism of L-arginine, a precursor of NO biosynthesis, has rarely been discussed. Autophagy, which is crucial for energy homeostasis, regulates endothelial functions, including NO production and angiogenesis, and is a potential therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases. In this review, in addition to summarizing the molecular mechanisms underlying increased NO bioavailability and eNOS activation by statins, we also discuss the effects of statins on the metabolism of L-arginine.

TI The effect of Fe(iii) ions on oxygen-vacancy-rich BiVO4 on
   the photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Achieving efficient separation and transfer of the photogenerated carriers is significant in improving photocatalytic water oxidation activity over BiVO4. This is strongly related to the particle structure and surface chemistry. Here, a BiVO4 photocatalyst is synthesized by a co-precipitation method, in which urea is used as a pH modifier and bubble template growth agent. The synthesized BiVO4 particles show abundant oxygen vacancies and a higher {110} to {010} facet ratio than the case without a urea agent. The optimized BiVO4 samples exhibit very high catalytic activity, with the oxygen evolution rates of 680 mu mol h(-1) and 176 mu mol h(-1) with the sacrificial agents AgNO3 and Fe(NO3)(3), respectively, corresponding to the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 77.8% and 19.6% under 420 nm light irradiation. Interestingly, both results exceeded the theoretical oxygen evolution values which calculated from the reduction number of metal cations (Fe3+ -> Fe2+, Ag+ -> Ag). Based on a series of comparative experiments, we speculated that a new reaction might occur on the surface of BiVO4 in the solution during the photocatalytic oxygen evolution. It is expected that the proposed strategy and reaction mechanism could be extended to other photocatalysts' designs and applications.

TI Poorly crystallized nickel hydroxide carbonate loading with
   Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> ions as improved electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Oxygen evolution reaction is a critical process involved in various energy-related devices. In this study, nickel hydroxide carbonate nanosheets obtained through a urea assisted route were loaded with iron species by immersing nickel hydroxide carbonate in aqueous Fe3+ solution. The different K w values of nickel hydroxide and iron hydroxide induce the formation of Fe species on nickel hydroxide carbonate nanosheet surface with the releasing of Ni2+ ions. Owing to the loading of island-like Fe species on nickel based nanosheets, the thus designed and prepared composites show amounts of exposed heterointerfaces with strong interactions between the species, and so present excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution. At a lower overpotential of 277 mV, the optimized catalyst can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with higher stability. This study provides a new avenue for the development of OER electrocatalysts; that is, direct immersing with ion adsorption is effective.

Light exposure led to the reduction of S- and N-containing groups by photogenerated electrons and to oxidation of some carbon atoms by photogenerated holes and chemisorbed oxygen. A photocurrent generation was tested on the samples impregnated with Methylene Blue to explore how the carbon textiles' surface features affect the integrity of a dye. A marked blockage of the porosity and a surface alteration resulted in a decrease in photosensitivity. Among all samples, the one modified with urea showed the highest photoactivity, indicating the important role of a surface nitrogen environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of co-exposure to imidacloprid and gibberellic acid on redox
   status, kidney variables and histopathology in adult rats
SO ARCHIVES OF PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Data on the individual nephrotoxic effects of imidacloprid (IMI) and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) are scarce. Moreover, there is a lack of information about their combined effects on the renal tissue. Our study investigated the effects of IMI and GA(3) separately or together on rats kidney. IMI (64 mg/kg bw) was given for 3 weeks by gavage either individually or in combination with GA(3) (200 mg/L) via drinking water. IMI associated or no with GA(3) increased the levels of kidney malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products, protein carbonyls and metallothionein, plasma creatinine, urea, blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase activity. A decline of kidney uric acid level and antioxidant status was also observed. All these changes were supported by histopathological observations. Our results highlighted the role of IMI and/or GA(3)-induced nephrotoxicity. Co-exposure to IMI and GA(3) exhibited synergism in biochemical kidney variables and histopathology and antagonism in physical and morphological parameters.

TI The oxidative thermal exfoliation-dependent microstructure and
   photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 nanosheets
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB The preparation of ultrathin nanosheets is conducive to increasing the material's specific surface area and introducing suitable defect sites. This facilitates the enhancement of the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and improves the adsorption and degradation efficiency toward pollutants. Various nitrogen-rich precursors were employed for the synthesis of bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) and its ultrathin nanosheets, with a focus on investigating their photocatalytic performance. The degree of polymerization of g-C3N4 influenced its hydrogen bonding and C/N ratio, affecting the ultrathin nanosheet microstructure. Oxidation disrupted the tri-s-triazine rings in the ultrathin nanosheets of g-C3N4 prepared via dicyandiamide. However, g-C3N4 prepared from urea and melamine as precursors retained its primary characteristics after thermal oxidative exfoliation, attributed to interlayer hydrogen bonds, small lateral size at low polymerization degrees, and increased vacancy defects. In the photocatalytic degradation system, two-dimensional nanosheets of g-C3N4 synthesized from urea exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency.

TI Energy-efficient electrolytic H2 production and high-value
   added H2-acid-base co-electrosynthesis modes enabled by a
   Ni2P catalyst in a diaphragm cell
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB Reducing the energy consumption and increasing the additional value of water electrolysis to produce H-2 is currently a hot research topic. In this work, we introduce two kinds of promising water electrolysis modes in a diaphragm electrolytic cell for H-2 production. When considering the energy consumption, a urea-assisted amphoteric water splitting system was built. This system just needs an ultralow voltage of 0.88 V to attain the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with high durability, which leads to a large decrease of energy consumption of 48.55% compared to alkaline water splitting system by the introduction of electrochemical neutralization energy and thermodynamically-favorable urea oxidation reaction. When considering the additional value, a H2-acid -base co-electrosynthesis system was proposed inspired by the chlor-alkali and electrochemical seawater desali-nation processes. In this system, only K2SO4 electrolytes are needed, and acid-base chemicals and H-2 could be generated at a voltage of 2.32 V (10 mA cm(-2)).

TI Facile synthesis of NiCo2S4@Ni3Se2
   nanocomposites for supercapacitor and electrocatalytic
   H2 production
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In this work, NiCo2S4@Ni3Se2 nanocomposites were fabricated with facile hydrothermal + electrodeposition method on Ni foam and the performances of energy storage and hydrogen evolution reaction were systematically investigated. As the electrode material for supercapacitor, NiCo2S4@Ni3Se2 demonstrated a specific capacitance of 9.82F cm-2 at 3 mA cm-2. The corresponding asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited the specific capacitance of 5.18F cm-2 at 3 mA cm-2 and retained 66.6% with current density increasing to 20 mA cm-2. Moreover, NiCo2S4@Ni3Se2-1.0-5 exhibited an outstanding electrocatalytic activation with low potential of 1.396 V for urea electrooxidation reaction (UOR) and 1.415 V for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) at current density of 10 mA cm-2 and the corresponding two-electrode overall water splitting potential reached at 1.566 V in 1 M KOH + 0.1 M urea. Thus, this study demonstrates the promising practical applications of NiCo2S4@Ni3Se2 nanocomposites for energy storage and hydrogen evolution reaction.

TI Closed-Loop Recyclable and Extrusion Reprocessable Thermosets Enabled by
   Guanylthiourea Structure
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Plastic recycling is a critical step toward improving waste management and achieving economic recycling. Here, a thermoset crosslinked by guanythiourea structure (GTUH network) is reported, that addresses the recycling issue of thermosets by serial hybridization of thiourea and guanidine urea. The dual dissociative dynamic exchange reaction of guanamine urea and thiourea, combined with non-covalent hydrogen bonding interactions, endows the network with rapid relaxation ability. GTUH networks, in particular, can be recycled through continuous extrusion processing due to multiple reversible mechanisms, as opposed to hot pressing alone. Even if reprocessed by hot pressing, only 5 min at 140 degrees C and 10 MPa are required. The oxidation enhancement mechanism of thiourea contributes to maintaining or even improving the mechanical properties of the recycled network. Moreover, the dynamic reactions of guanythiourea structure allow for closed-loop chemical recycling of the network. Research into recyclable carbon fiber-reinforced composites indicates promising potential applications for this material in the circular economy and resources.

TI A "Superaerophobic" Se-Doped CoS2 Porous Nanowires Array for
   Cost-Saving Hydrogen Evolution
SO CATALYSTS
AB The pursuit of low-cost and high-efficiency catalyst is imperative for the development and utilization of hydrogen energy. Heteroatomic doping which is conducive to the redistribution of electric density is one of the promising strategies to improve catalytic activity. Herein, the Se-doped CoS2 porous nanowires array with a superaerophobic surface was constructed on carbon fiber. Due to the electronic modulation and the unique superaerophobic structure, it showed improved hydrogen evolution activity and stability in urea-containing electrolyte. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotentials are 188 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 1.46 V for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). When it was set as a cell, the voltage is low as 1.44 V. Meanwhile, the current densities of HER and UOR, as well as of cell remained basically unchanged after a continuous operation for 48 h. This work opens up a new idea for designing of cost-saving hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts.

TI Co3O4 with Different Morphologies: Synthesis and
   Performances in Activating Peroxymonosulfate for Methylene Blue
   Degradation
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Three methods (urea hydrothermal-calcination, chemical bath deposition-calcination, and oxalate pyrolysis) were used to prepare CO3O4 powder materials with different morphologies, which were named CO3O4-A, CO3O4-B, and CO3O4-C, respectively. All of them were taken as catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the degradation of methylene blue (MB). It is found that these CO3O4 materials were quite different in their catalytic performance. Under the assistance of CO3O4-A, CO3O4-B, and CO3O4-C, the PMS decomposition reaction rate constants were measured as 0.047 1, 0.217 4, and 0.003 7 min(-1), while the degradation ratios of MB were 91.25% (reaction time: 50 min), 100.00% (reaction time: 25 min), and 31.55% (reaction time: 50 min), respectively. That is, CO3O4-B had the best catalytic performance. To make clear the difference in the catalytic ability of CO3O4 a series of characterizations were carried out. It is discovered that these CO3O4 materials are different in many ways such as crystallinity, microstructure, specific surface area, surface oxygen vacancy concentration, and surface hydroxyl density. And it is confirmed that the primary factor influencing the catalytic performance of CO3O4 is the surface hydroxyl density. In addition, the optimized parameters for MB degradation in the CO3O4-B/PMS reaction system were determined as follows: reaction temperature 25 degrees C, catalyst dosage 0.02 g.L-1, and PMS dosage 0.6 mmol.L-1, where the MB degradation ratio was as high as 98.33%. Moreover, the reactive oxygen species center dot SO4-, center dot OH, center dot O-2(-) and O-1 were all detected in the CO3O4-B/PMS system according to the quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance tests, and sulfate radicals were identified as the primary reactive oxygen species.

TI Novel peroxymonosulfate activation system based on catalyst prepared
   from solid waste
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The recycling of solid waste is of increasing economic and environmental significance. Herein, a low-cost and environmentally friendly catalyst was prepared by simple pyrolysis using warm paste residue as raw material and urea as nitrogen source. The prepared WPR-N-700 catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) by activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The removal of 99% BPA in 20 mg L-1 solution was achieved within 30 min in WPR-N-700/PMS system by adding 0.3 g L-1 catalyst and 0.2 g L-1 PMS. The systematic experiments showed that the catalyst exhibited good catalytic versatility and adaptability in many types of refractory organic pollutants and coexisting inorganic ionic systems. The catalyst still had good magnetic properties and could be easily separated under the external magnetic field. The free radical quenching test and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) test revealed that sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-), radicals (center dot OH), superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)) and singlet oxygen (1O2) were the primary reactive oxygen species for the degradation of BPA in the WPR-N-700/PMS system. Thus, this study provides an economical and effective method for the recycling of solid waste, and innovatively proposes a new idea of using solid waste to prepare catalysts.

TI Underpotential deposition of silver on gold from deep eutectic
   electrolytes
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The electrochemical behavior of Ag(I) in choline chloride-urea medium (ChCl-U) has been investigated at a gold electrode using cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammograms revealed a diffusion limited reduction wave coupled on the reverse sweep with an oxidation wave that corresponds to the dissolution of a bulk deposit. Beside these main peaks, we have highlighted other peaks at potentials more positive than the thermodynamic potential of silver bulk deposition. Experiments at various potential scan rates have indicated that, contrary to the main reduction peak, these peaks are indicative of a surface process that corresponds to an underpotential deposition (upd) of silver. The absence of upd at glassy carbon or platinum electrodes in ChCl-U has ruled out the influence of silver speciation on the existence of the upd process. The occurrence of silver upd on gold is moreover not linked to the nature of the H-bond donor (urea, ethylene glycol or oxalic acid) of the choline choride DES. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Electrodegradation of cyclophosphamide in artificial urine by combined
   methods
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB The degradation of the chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide in artificial urine was evaluated by Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Processes (EAOP). The system consisted of an electrochemical flow reactor with a commercial DSA(R) electrode (nominal composition Ti / Ru0,3Ti0,7O2) and Ti-mesh cathode. In order to assess the best parameters, the effect of current density, time and flow rate were analyzed using an initial 2(3) factorial design. The chosen response variable was the energy efficiency to produce free chlorine species (HClO/ClO-). After obtaining the most significant factors, the Central Composite Design (CCD) was performed, where the optimum conditions were determined for the current density range (11.714 mA cm(-2) and 66.57 mA cm(-2)), flow rate (31.33 mL min(-1)) and time range (19 and 37 min). Under an optimized condition, the efficiency of other combined methods (photo-assisted electrochemical, photochemical, sonoelectrochemical and photo-assisted sonoelectrochemical) was evaluated. The efficiency of degradation processes was determined by removal of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), creatinine and urea. Analysis by HPLC demonstrates that the cyclophosphamide was substantially removed during the treatment process of similar to 77%. Based on these results, it can be observed that the coupling between electrochemical and photochemical processes is a promising alternative for the treatment of this effluent, as a marked reduction of organic matter is observed (63, 94% of creatinine, 29.62% of urea, 39.1% of TOC) and a low treatment cost ratio.

TI Composition Tuned Electron Rearrangement of Transition-Metal-Based
   Compounds Promotes Hydrogen Generation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts are criticallyimportantfor sustainable generation of green hydrogen. Though many advancedtransition-metal-based catalysts have been well developed, the composition-structure-performancerelationship is still arguable. Herein, we comprehensively investigatedthe catalytic performance of transition-metal-based compounds withtuned chemical compositions but similar atomic and microstructuresto disentangle the roles of chemical composition from the structuraleffects. Based on a series of characterizations, we found that theengineering of transition metal cations would lead to electron rearrangementand then improve the catalytic activity of the formed transition metaloxides (TMO) toward water oxidation. The intake of anions on the TMOsurface resulted in the change of surface charge, making them multifunctionalcatalysts for both urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions.By using the prepared TMO and derived heterostructured a-TMO/c-TMSin the two-electrode system, the constructed TMO & PAR;a-TMO/c-TMSexhibited a much decreased potential for alkali hydrogen generationthan that of the noble-metal-based system (IrO2 & PAR;Pt).This work reveals the roles of cations and anions in transition-metal-basedmaterials for energy conversion reactions, which would shed lighton the design of novel and efficient catalysts by chemical compositiontuning.

TI Enhancing stability and immobilization techniques for graphitic carbon
   nitride in photocatalytic applications
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS
AB Emerging contaminants from urban and industrial sources require effective water treatment and photocatalysis using graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) is emerging as a promising solution. This graphitic polymer, devoid of metals in its structure, exhibits properties similar to titanium oxide, the quintessential traditional photocatalyst. This work aims to optimize the application of GCN as photocatalysts, emphasizing its role in photocatalytic processes by improving its properties for the visible light-assisted photodegradation process and assessing the removal of a selected pollutant, Rhodamine B. Initially, the role of the catalyst precursor (urea, melamine and a ratio 1:1 of them) in the synthesis was evaluated. GCN obtained from urea as precursor yielded to better properties and higher purity of the catalyst. In addition, through acid treatment, slight improvements in the material properties were verified, such as an increase of the crystallinity and active sites. This acid modified catalyst enhanced the photocatalytic process, achieving complete removal of Rhodamine B in 30 min. A significant improvement in the chemical stability of the material was also observed, maintaining nearly its entire removal efficacy after 10 cycles. However, several operational problems were observed due to the powder form of the GCN, and, thus, requesting the development of efficient immobilized catalysts. Therefore, three techniques (encapsulation, electrospinning, and composite) were evaluated and the variations in GCN distribution and their influence on the photocatalysis process ascertained. From this evaluation, it can be concluded that the electrospinning technique, using polyacrylonitrile polymer (PAN) to form fibres, generated a highly porous, hydrophilic material with excellent floatability. This allowed maximizing radiation exposure during the process, achieving an 85 % reduction of Rhodamine B concentration in 90 min. Among other remarkable properties, GCN exhibits high reusability when incorporated into PAN fibres, as it remained chemically and physically stable, retaining more than 85 % of its dye removal efficiency after 4 cycles.

TI Thiol surface functionalization via continuous phase plasma
   polymerization of allyl mercaptan, with subsequent maleimide-linked
   conjugation of collagen
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A
AB Thiol groups can undergo a large variety of chemical reactions and are used in solution phase to conjugate many bioactive molecules. Previous research on solid substrates with continuous phase glow discharge polymerization of thiol-containing monomers may have been compromised by oxidation. Thiol surface functionalization via glow discharge polymerization has been reported as requiring pulsing. Herein, continuous phase glow discharge polymerization of allyl mercaptan (2-propene-1-thiol) was used to generate significant densities of thiol groups on a mixed macrodiol polyurethane and tantalum. Three general classes of chemistry are used to conjugate proteins to thiol groups, with maleimide linkers being used most commonly. Here the pH specificity of maleimide reactions was used effectively to conjugate surface-bound thiol groups to amine groups in collagen. XPS demonstrated surface-bound thiol groups without evidence of oxidation, along with the subsequent presence of maleimide and collagen. Glow discharge reactor parameters were optimized by testing the resistance of bound collagen to degradation by 8 M urea. The nature of the chemical bonding of collagen to surface thiol groups was effectively assessed by colorimetric assay (ELISA) of residual collagen after incubation in 8 M urea over 8days and after incubation with keratinocytes over 15days. The facile creation of useable solid-supported thiol groups via continuous phase glow discharge polymerization of allyl mercaptan opens a route for attaching a vast array of bioactive molecules.

TI Coumarin glycosides from Hydrangea paniculata slow down the
   progression of diabetic nephropathy by targeting Nrf2 anti-oxidation and
   smad2/3-mediated profibrosis
SO PHYTOMEDICINE
AB Background: Water extract of Hydrangea paniculata (HP) stem, rich in coumarin glycosides, has been demonstrated to have renal protective effect in several experimental kidney injury animal models. Currently, it is under pre-clinical development as a class 5 herbal drug against membranous nephropathy. However, whether it also benefits diabetic nephropathy (DN) is not clear.
   Purpose: This study was performed to investigate the protective effect of HP on streptozotocin-induced experimental DN, and further understand its molecular mechanisms.
   Methods: In the present study, type 1 diabetes rat model was established by the intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. HP was orally administered every day for three months. Biochemical analysis and histopathological staining were conducted to evaluate the renal functions. In vivo pharmacokinetic study was conducted to analyse the metabolites of HP with high blood drug concentration. In vitro assay using these metabolites was performed to analyse their ability to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced under high glucose (HG) condition by flow cytometry. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was conducted to analyse the mRNA level of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and IL6 and western blot was performed to analyse the phosphorylation status of smad 2/3 in HK2 cells under TGF beta 1 stimulation.
   Results: The treatment with HP significantly reduced the blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine content, and urine albumin excretion in diabetic rats, and increased the creatinine clearance rate. Periodic acid-schiff and methenamine staining and immunohistochemistry revealed that HP also ameliorated glomerulosclerosis and tubular vacuolar degeneration, as well as the deposition of fibronectin and collagen IV in the glomeruli. Pharmacokinetic study results revealed that the major coumarin compounds from HP were metabolised into umbelliferone and esculetin. By in vitro assay, umbelliferone and esculetin were found to significantly decrease ROS production induced by HG content, as well as increase the mRNA level of Nrf2. HP and its metabolites also can down-regulate fibronectin secretion in HK2 cells stimulated by TGF beta 1 and inhibit smad2/3 phosphorylation.
   Conclusion: HP has beneficial effect on DN by increasing Nrf2 expression and inhibiting TGF-smad signal activation. Further, it can be a novel herbal drug against DN.

CT Annual Meeting of the Pediatric-Academic-Societies (PAS)
CY MAY 05-08, 2018
CL Toronto, CANADA
SP Pediat Acad Soc
AB Background Children with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are at risk for metabolic crises triggered by acute illnesses. Crises are identified through laboratory evaluations. Objectives Our objective was to determine national adherence to minimum laboratory evaluations for patients with IEM in emergency departments (EDs), as well as factors associated with laboratory evaluation adherence. Methods Using the Pediatric Health Information System, we identified visits to 48 EDs from 2012 to 2017 by children with IEM. We analyzed visits for catabolic conditions (dehydration, gastroenteritis, or vomiting) and determined variation in minimum laboratory evaluation adherence. Multivariable models were created to determine predictors of adherence. Results Among the visits by children with disorders of the urea cycle, organic acid metabolism, and fatty acid oxidation, 1457 (76.3%) of 1909 adhered to the minimum laboratory evaluation. Median ED-level adherence was 78.2% (interquartile range, 67.4-92.5). Factors associated with adherence were disorder [fatty acid oxidation vs urea cycle disorder; adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 9.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.07-21.47], annual ED volume of patients with IEM (quartile 4 vs 1; aOR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.51-8.49), and presence of a biochemical genetics fellowship (aOR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.14-0.62). Conclusions Patients with IEM frequently did not receive minimum laboratory evaluations for catabolic conditions. Measures to improve laboratory use in children with IEM should be undertaken.

TI Morphology and electronic structure modulation induced by fluorine
   doping in nickel-based heterostructures for robust bifunctional
   electrocatalysis
SO NANOSCALE
AB Fabrication of advanced electrocatalysts with high activity and durability is urgently needed to achieve energy conversion and pollution treatment at the same time. Herein, we highlight a fluorine-doped nickel-based heterostructure, in which fluorine doping displays a dual effect in Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets/Ni3S2 heteronanorods. On the one hand, fluorine doping can facilitate the formation of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets/Ni3S2 heteronanorods through one-step in situ growth on nickel foams. The unique heterostructure enables good exposure of abundant active sites and highly active heterointerfaces. On the other hand, the uniform incorporation of fluorine can effectively modulate the electron density at the Fermi level of Ni3S2, contributing to the improved electrical conductivity and charge transfer efficiency, further improving the electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The optimal heterostructure presents a low overpotential of 360 mV to reach the OER current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Finally, this heterostructure also displays a superior UOR anodic peak current of about 322.9 mA cm(-2), almost the highest value at the anodic peak compared to the literature.

TI A moist-electric generator based on oxidized and aminated regenerated
   cellulose
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Moist-electric generation has been more focused in recent years, which is an emerging sustainable energy harvesting technology. Moist-electric generator (MEG) is a prospective energy harvesting device that collects energy only from humidity. While the existed researches focused on the ionic wood, cellulose nanofibril and cellulose acetate, this work pays attention to the oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) and aminated regenerated cellulose (ARC) prepared by urea/NaOH/water system from pulp, which has excellent hydrophilicity and abundant active sites attributing to the abundant functional groups and three-dimension porous structure. Its asymmetric active electrode and asymmetric ORC and ARC structure cause a humidity gradient between the two electrodes as exposed in a humidity environment, which produce potential difference under the ion concentration gradient for the directional transport of protons derived from the ionization effect, thus generating an electric current in external circuit. Of which, 12-ORC-MEG can generate an open-circuit voltage of 1.07 V at 85%RH humidity. 5ARC-MEG can produce the output voltage as high as 4.20 V for the brought more isoelectric points by grafting amino, which is about 4 times than that of 12-ORC-MEG. The MEG as a sensor and generator can generate a certain output voltage in contact with sweaty fingers or intermittent fog. Just one 5-ARC-MEG can power microelectronic devices, such as LED lamp and watch. This work develops a simple, inexpensive, and green MEG with renewable cellulose material that can generate sustainable moist-electric conversion from ambient humidity. It has great potential in green energy and opens up new possibilities for portable electronic products.

TI Modulation of active surface sites on Ni-Fe-S by the dynamic hydrogen
   bubble template method for energy-saving hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB A 3-D porous structure of Ni-Fe-S nanosheets was created using a dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT), which promotes active site exposure, on a nickel foam substrate as an efficient electrode for production of hydrogen through electrochemical splitting assisted by the urea oxidation reaction. In a DHBT, high applied current densities result in the reduction of H+ ions alongside the Ni-Fe-S, forming H2. These H2 bubbles block the surface and force the remaining ions to electrodeposit between the bubbles, resulting in a porous structure. The electrocatalyst exhibited remarkable performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The parameters investigated in this study included applied current density, duration time, and FeSO4 concentration. The electrocatalyst synthesized at 5 A cm-2, 10 s, and 0.1 M FeSO4 demonstrated the highest catalytic activity, resulting in values of 85 and 173 mV vs. RHE for the HER and 1.26 and 1.30 V vs. RHE for the UOR to reach 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. In the two electrode system of Ni-Fe-S//Ni-Fe-S, it only requires a low voltage of 1.337 V vs. RHE to launch a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The enhanced activity is thought to stem from charge separation between the negatively charged S and the positively charged Ni and Fe, as well as the larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and increased porosity. An insignificant shift in the potential was observed over a duration of 50 h at 100 mA cm-2, indicating exceptional electrocatalytic stability for both the HER and UOR. This study presents the impact of the utilization of the UOR on enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of hydrogen production.
   A porous structure was electrosynthesized via a DHBT with interconnected nanosheets. The fabricated electrode demonstrated great activity for the UOR and HER.

TI Peroxidase activity of cytochrome c in its compact state depends
   on dynamics of the heme region
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-PROTEINS AND PROTEOMICS
AB Cytochrome c (cyt c) is a small globular hemoprotein with the main function as an electron carrier in mitochondrial respiratory chain. Cyt c possesses also peroxidase-like activity in the native state despite its six coordinated heme iron. In this work, we studied the effect of increasing urea concentration in the range from 0 M to 6 M at p1-17 (pH value of the bulk solvent) and pH 5 (pH value close to negatively charged membrane) on peroxidase-like activity of cyt c. We show that peroxidase-like activity, measured by guaiacol oxidation and the ferrous oxidation in xylenol orange methods, correlates with the accessibility of the heme iron, which was assessed from the association rate constant of cyanide binding to cyt c. Cyt c peroxidase-like activity linearly increases in the pre-denaturational urea concentrations (0-4 M) at both studied pHs without an apparent formation of penta-coordinated state of the heme iron. Our results suggest that dynamic equilibrium among the denaturant-induced non-native coordination states of cyt c, very likely due to reversible unfolding of the least stable foldons, is pre-requisite for enhanced peroxidase-like activity of cyt c in its compact state. Dynamic re Placement of the native sixth coordination bond of methionine-80 by lysines (72, 73, and 79) and partially also by histidines (26 and 33) provides an efficient way how to increase peroxidase-like activity of cyt c without significant conformational change at physiological conditions.

TI Manganese oxide catalyzed synthesis of anti-HIV N-substituted

SO CATALYSIS COMMUNICATIONS
AB 1, 2-Disubstituted benzimidazoles are drug discovery targets and play an important role in many areas. Herein, non-noble-metal alpha-MnO2 prepared using urea as the additive was found to be an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of antiviral 1,2-disubstituted benzimidazoles via one-pot multistep reactions using dimethyl carbonate and air as green solvent and oxidant, respectively. The catalytic system could tolerate 1, 2-diol or alcohols as raw via cascade oxidation/cyclization/alkylation to realize the desired products in moderate to good yields. The catalyst was characterized by ICP-AES, XRD, BET, SEM, TEM and XPS, which indicates that the surface oxygen species seriously affected the catalytic performance. And the leaching of Na/K ions in tunnels of the catalyst caused loss of catalytic activity of retrieved alpha-MnO2.

TI Four components of the conjugated redox system in organisms: Carbon,
   nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen
SO BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW
AB C1 compounds participate in various metabolic processes and regulations including DNA methylation. Formaldehyde (FA), a product of methyl group oxidation, is highly cytotoxic. In the cell, there are two pathways of its utilization: assimilation and oxidation. Formaldehyde displays cytotoxicity, and therefore its oxidation is considered as detoxification. The sensitivity to the threshold concentration of FA we regard as an indication of its major role in biosystem functioning. A model of a three-component conjugated redox system is proposed in which the methyl group oxidation pathway is an archaic and conservative donor of protons and electrons, the reduction of O-2 serves as an acceptor, and the arginine amino group is used for production of both urea and nitric oxide (the donor and acceptor, respectively). The fourth component of the redox system is glutathione, which maintains redox balance. The three-level system of proton donors includes the oxidation of a methyl group (first level), the oxidation of acetate in mitochondria (second level), and glucose catabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway (third level). The whole redox system is united by the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines, glutathione, thioredoxin, and alpha-lipoic acid. The central regulatory role in this redox system belongs to glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, which controls FA binding with tetrahydrofolic acid, arginine methylation, and denitrosation of sulfhydryl groups. The conjugated redox system was formed during evolution as a union of separate redox cycles of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen.

TI The effect of graphitic carbon nitride precursors on the photocatalytic
   dye degradation of water-dispersible graphitic carbon nitride
   photocatalysts
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB In this study, water-dispersible graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesized through chemical oxidation of bulk g-C3N4 produced from different starting nitrogen-rich organic precursors such as dicyandiamide, melamine, urea, and thiourea by thermal treatment. The effects of g-C3N4 precursors on water-dispersible g-C3N4 photo catalysts were investigated using several characterization tools and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB). Exfoliation of bulk g-C3N4 by chemical oxidation gave rise to the characteristic properties of water-dispersible g-C3N4 such as a high surface area, thin-layered morphology, an increase in band gap, and significant reduction in the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which improved the photocatalytic activity of water-dispersible g-C3N4 for MB photodegradation. The photocatalytic activities of water-dispersible g-C3N4 photocatalysts were also strongly influenced by N-rich g-C3N4 precursors for bulk g-C3N4. The presence of foreign atoms (sulfur, S) in thiourea induced the formation of sulfur-containing nanoporous water-dispersible g-C3N4. The highest MB adsorption ability and charge separation efficiency of the S-containing nanoporous water-dispersible g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibited a synergistic effect on MB photodegradation, resulting in the highest photocatalytic activity.

   Device with In-Line NMR Monitoring
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB The fast and effective neutralization of the mustardgas simulant 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) using a simple and portable continuous flow device is reported. Neutralization takes place through a fully selective sulfoxidation by a stable source of hydrogen peroxide (alcoholic solution of urea-H2O2 adduct/MeSO3H freshly prepared). The reaction progress can be monitored with an in-line benchtop NMR spectrometer, allowing a real-time adjustment of reaction conditions. Inherent features of millireactors, that is, perfect control of mixing, heat and reaction time, allowed the neutralization of 25 g of pure CEES within 46 minutes in a 21.5 mL millireactor (t(R) = 3.9 minutes). This device, which relies on affordable and nontoxic reagents, fits into a suitcase, and can be deployed by police/military forces directly on the attack site.

TI Direct methylation of N-methylaniline with
   CO2/H2 catalyzed by gold nanoparticles supported
   on alumina
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Small gold nanoparticles (similar to 3 nm) loaded onto various supports have been prepared by a deposition-precipitation method and studied for direct methylation of N-methylaniline with CO2/H-2. Among the catalysts examined, an acid-base bifunctional support gamma-alumina supported gold catalyst (Au/g-Al2O3) exhibits the best catalytic performance. Au/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts with controlled mean Au particle sizes (1.8-8.3 nm) have also been successfully prepared by regulating the concentration of HAuCl4 in solution, aging time, aging temperature and mole ratio of urea to gold in the process of deposition-precipitation with urea. The turnover frequency (TOF) values for direct methylation of N-methylaniline with CO2/H-2 increase on decreasing the mean size of Au nanoparticles (from 8.3 to 1.8 nm), showing that methylation of N-methylaniline with CO2/H-2 is a structure-sensitive reaction. A fast increase in TOF occurs when the mean Au particle size becomes smaller than 3 nm. Through TEM (transmission electron microscope), gold L-3-edge XAFS (X-ray absorption fine structure) and CO2- and NH3-TPD (temperature programmed desorption) analysis, we can conclude the Au particle sizes, oxidation state of the gold species and acid-base properties of the supports are responsible for the high catalytic activity of direct methylation of N-methylaniline with CO2/H-2.

TI Enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of N-doped TiO2
   nanograss array films by low-temperature sulfur doping
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB Moderate in-situ chemical oxidation of Ti meshes was used to prepare nitrogen-doped (N-doped) anatase TiO2 nano-grass array films with urea as the nitrogen source. Further sulfur doping through immersion of the films in a thiourea solution at a relatively low temperature of 353 K was subsequently performed to enhance the visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of the films. SEM images confirmed that the loose microstructure of the nanograss arrays became compact after N-doping or N, S co-doping. N-doping and N, S co-doping decreased the band gap values of the TiO2 films and increased the effective visible light utilization. XPS analysis revealed that nitrogen mainly existed in interstitial form. Subsequent sulfur ions appeared as S6+, S4+, and S2-, with S6+ and S4+ replacing Ti4+, and S2- replacing O2-, respectively. With an increase in the urea treatment time, the sulfur ions were oxidized, achieving higher valence states. S6+ substitution resulted in a charge imbalance, which could only be neutralized by hydroxide ions. The imbalance made it easier for water that had settled on the TiO2 films to chemically dissociate, and thereby generating hydroxyl radicals. OH center dot radicals as well as O-2(center dot-) radicals played a significant role in the degradation of RhB dye. The RhB decolorization activity achieved by the N, S co-doped samples was 48 times that of the undoped samples.

TI Synthesis of N-Acylsulfenamides from Amides and
   N-Thiosuccinimides
SO SYNTHESIS-STUTTGART
AB Herein is reported a robust and general method for the preparation of N-acylsulfenamides, important functionalities that have recently been utilized as central inputs for the asymmetric synthesis of high oxidation state sulfur compounds. This straightforward transformation proceeds by reaction of primary amides, carbamates, sulfonamides, sulfinamides, and ureas with stable N-thiosuccinimides or N- thiophthalimides, which in turn are prepared in a single step from commercial thiols. The use of stable N-thiosuccinimide and N-thiophthalim-ide reactants is desirable because it obviates the use of highly reactive sulfenyl chlorides.

TI Combustion Synthesis of CuO Nanomaterials: Effect of Different Fuels on
   the Structural, Thermal, and Optical Properties
SO ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The wet chemical combustion synthesis and the effect of different (aniline, citric acid monohydrate, dextrose, glycine, hexamine, oleic acid, sucrose, and urea) fuels on the combustion products of CuO nanomaterials are reported for the first time as a comparative study. The pure nano-sized CuO phase combustion products were produced from hexamine, urea, and glycine as fuels, whereas fuel-like sucrose yielded nearly a single phase of the CuO combustion product. The quality of the combustion products revealed mixed phases of CuO and Cu2O for aniline, dextrose, citric acid monohydrate, and oleic acid as fuels. The pure combustion products crystallized in a monoclinic structure with a space group, C12/c1 (15). For the mixed phases of combustion products, weight gain (102.5%-109%) is noted >400 degrees C in the TG curves owing to the oxidation of the Cu2O phase into the CuO phase. The bandgap of the different CuO powder was in the range of 2.1-2.6 eV. From the NIR spectra, we conclude that the nanocrystallinty of the CuO phase plays a major role in the enhancement (similar to 35%) of NIR reflectance owing to the difference in the fuels used. The observed Raman modes confirm the characteristics of the CuO phase. Different morphologies are observed for the different CuO combustion products obtained from hexamine, urea, and glycine as fuels.

TI Particle size primarily shifts chemical composition of organic matter
   under long-term fertilization in paddy soil
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB The chemistry of soil organic matter (SOM) is critical for soil functions. However, the chemical composition and oxidation state of physical SOM fractions under long-term mineral and organic amendments in paddy soils are still unclear. Here, we investigated this issue using three particle size classes of SOM sampled from five long-term (37-years) fertilisation regimes in a subtropical paddy soil which were analysed using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM, >250 mu m), fine particulate organic matter (fPOM, 53-250 mu m) and mineral-associated organic matter (MOM, <53 mu m) were isolated. The five fertilisation regimes were (1) unfertilised (control), (2) nitrogen (N, urea), (3) nitrogen + phosphorus + potassium (NPK, urea + Ca(H2PO4)(2) + KCl), (4) NPK + straw (NPKS) and (5) NPK + Astragalus sinicus L. + pig manure (NPKM). After 37-years, the SOM content of the control, N, NPK, NPKS and NPKM treatments had increased by 16.3%, 12.3%, 31.6%, 41.7% and 59.8% compared with the initial level, respectively. The pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N (TN), as well as the C/N ratio in the soil matrix, were localised by particle size, with the majority in the mineral-associated organic matter (MOM). Particle size, not fertilisation regime, primarily associated with shifts in the chemical composition of SOM, with selective preservation of lignin and polysaccharides in the particulate organic matter (POM) and enrichments of lipids and N-containing compounds in the MOM. The origin (plant- and microbial-derived) and oxidation state of SOM were also regulated by particle size (especially the coarse particles) but not fertilisation treatment. Despite long-term persistence, the MOM had a lower C oxidation state (implying higher vulnerability to microbial utilisation) than the coarse POM (cPOM) and fine POM (fPOM). In conclusion, fertilisation regime regulated the bulk SOM (SOC and TN) pool, whereas physical particle size generated a divergence trend in the chemical composition and oxidation state of SOM in the subropical paddy soil, indicating the greater role of physical arrangement in SOM chemistry than the quality of amendments. Highlights Particle size, not fertilisation regime, regulated chemical composition and oxidation state of SOM. POM is enriched in lignin and polysaccharides while MOM is enriched in lipids and N-containing compounds. Physical arrangement plays a greater role in SOM chemistry than the quality of amendments.

TI The structure of agricultural microplastics (PT, PU and UF) and their
   sorption capacities for PAHs and PHE derivates under various salinity
   and oxidation treatments
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Microplastic (MP) pollution and its potential to concentrate and transport organic contaminants in environments have recently gained widespread attention. Compared to traditional nonpolar plastics such as polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), study about the environmental behavior of polyurethane (PT), polyuria (PU) and urea-formaldehyde resin (UF), which are typically used as shell materials for pesticide microcapsules and have polar structure is scarce. In the present study, we investigated the sorption capacities and binding mechanisms of FT, PU and UF for three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, naphthalene, phenanthrene (PHE), and pyrene) and two PHE derivates (ethylphenanthrene-2-carboxylate (2-CPHE) and 2-methylphenathrene (2-MPHE)) selected as the model compounds, and the effects of salinity and UV and/or H2O2 aging treatments on PHE sorption to MPs. The results showed that PT, PU and UF had negative surface charges, micron-scaled sizes and abundant polar functional groups containing 0 and N elements. Fr, PU and UF could sorb PAHs efficiently with sorption coefficients (K-d) being in the range of 8.11 x 10(3)-9.53 x 10(5) (L/Kg) and partitioning was the main sorption mechanism with polar interactions (H-boning and p/pi-pi EDA interactions) also contributing. The sorption capacity of the three MPs changed mainly depending on their glass transition temperatures (T-g). Furthermore, high salinity decreased the surface zeta-potential of the MPs and enhanced PHE sorption to MPs. In addition, aging treatments with UV and/or H2O2 markedly decreased the T-g of PT and enhanced its sorption capacity for PHE, while opposite results were obtained for PU. The findings on the sorption mechanisms of PAHs to agricultural MPs are useful for predicting the transport, fate and persistence of the co-existing HOCs in agricultural ecosystems and provide a scientific basis for the comprehensive risk assessment of agricultural MPs.

TI Enabling Al-metal anodes for aqueous electrochemical cells by using
   low-cost eutectic mixtures as artificial protective interphase
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Elemental aluminum is an exciting battery anode material due to its high abundance and volumetric capacity (8040 mAh cm(-3)). However, it tends to form a stubborn surface oxide layer that blocks ion transport through the electrode-electrolyte interphase and stops battery cyclability. To circumvent this problem, here we engineer an artificial protective barrier layer on metallic Al by using AlCl3 + urea and AlCl3 + triethylamine hydrochloride eutectic coating formulations. We find both coatings provide significantly facile ion migration kinetics at the anode/electrolyte interface, enabling a drastic reduction in anodic electroplating/stripping overpotentials, but AlCl3 + urea is superior. Using depth-profiling XPS spectroscopy and impedance studies, we find that the AlCl3 + urea derived artificial interphase is also stable in ambient air, affording extended protection for metallic Al anodes from air-oxidation in the form of a battery electrode SEI. We demo the eutectic-treated Al anode (UTAl) based on a FeHCF | 2 m AlTFS | UTAl full cell chemistry and obtain a stable battery performance of -60 Wh kg(-1) over 100 cycles. Our study promotes the strategic viability of using facile, inexpensive reagent treatments to enable the application of water-based electrolytes for rechargeable Al-ion batteries, and specifically encourages systematic exploration of analogue coating formulations using our anode enhancement protocol for similar high-capacity metal/alloy battery chemistries.

TI Prebiotic Syntheses of Organophosphorus Compounds from Reduced Source of
   Phosphorus in Non-Aqueous Solvents
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB Reduced-oxidation-state phosphorus (reduced P, hereafter) compounds were likely available on the early Earth via meteorites or through various geologic processes. Due to their reactivity and high solubility, these compounds could have played a significant role in the origin of various organophosphorus compounds of biochemical significance. In the present work, we study the reactions between reduced P compounds and their oxidation products, with the three nucleosides (uridine, adenosine, and cytidine), with organic alcohols (glycerol and ethanolamine), and with the tertiary ammonium organic compound, choline chloride. These reactions were studied in the non-aqueous solvent formamide and in a semi-aqueous solvent comprised of urea: ammonium formate: water (UAFW, hereafter) at temperatures of 55-68 degrees C. The inorganic P compounds generated through Fenton chemistry readily dissolve in the non-aqueous and semi-aqueous solvents and react with organics to form organophosphites and organophosphates, including those which are identified as phosphate diesters. This dual approach (1) use of non-aqueous and semi-aqueous solvents and (2) use of a reactive inorganic P source to promote phosphorylation and phosphonylation reactions of organics readily promoted anhydrous chemistry and condensation reactions, without requiring any additive, catalyst, or other promoting agent under mild heating conditions. We also present a comparative study of the release of P from various prebiotically relevant phosphate minerals and phosphite salts (e.g., vivianite, apatite, and phosphites of iron and calcium) into formamide and UAFW. These results have direct implications for the origin of biological P compounds from non-aqueous solvents of prebiotic provenance.

TI Efficient and stable photocatalytic NO removal on C self-doped
   g-C3N4: electronic structure and reaction
   mechanism
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Although graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, CN) has been widely studied for its photocatalytic applications in environmental remediation and solar energy conversion, the electronic structure of CN has not been optimized in terms of reactant activation and ROS generation. In this work, C self-doped g-C3N4 (CN-C) was prepared by co-pyrolysis of urea and saccharose and showed highly enhanced photocatalytic NO removal efficiency in comparison with the pristine CN. Theoretical and experimental methods were highly combined to illustrate the geometric structures of CN-C and reveal the promotion mechanisms in terms of enhanced optical and electron transfer properties. The unique electronic structure of CN-C allows NO and O-2 to be more easily activated for the production of reactive radicals to participate in the photocatalytic redox reaction. The enhanced production of reactive radicals and the boosted separation rate of photogenerated carriers could promote the photocatalysis efficiency, leading to efficient and stable photocatalytic oxidation of NO over C self-doped g-C3N4. Importantly, the conversion pathways of photocatalytic NO oxidation over CN and CN-C have been elucidated based on the results of DFT calculations, ESR spectra and in situ DRIFTS spectra. A new absorption band at 2175 cm(-1) associated with the NO+ intermediate is discovered for CN-C. The present work could offer new insights into the understanding of the electronic structure and photocatalytic NO oxidation mechanism on typical photocatalysts.

TI Sandwich template derived porous ZnO@gCN heterostructure nanocomposites
   and the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency in oxidative coupling of

SO OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB The construction of heterostructure composites is an efficient way to widen the spectral response range and reduce the photogenerated electrons-holes recombination, but it is still a challenge to realize the maximizing the photocatalytic performance of different photoresponsive material, especially at low temperature. In this work, we construct a series of ZnO@gCN-UA/MA composites by first designing a series of UA@ZIF-8@MA sandwich templates and then calcining these sandwich templates at high temperature. During the pyrolysis process, ZIF-8 and melamine precursors would convert into ZnO and gCN structure so as to form the ZnO@gCN composite at high temperature, while urea molecular would decompose to release ammonia molecules which rush out from the interior of ZIF-8 to make the ZnO@gCN-UA/MA composites become fluffy and porous. Detailed character-ization results reveal that the ZnO@gCN-UA/MA composites exhibit enhanced spectral response range and the lower charge-carrier recombination rates. When being used in photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amines at low temperature under air condition, the optimal ZnO(0.1)@gCN-UA/MA catalyst exhibits excellent activity, affording the imine product with 96% yield. Moreover, the catalysts also exhibit a wide substrate compatibility and recyclability.

AB Nanosized inorganic metal oxides, such as TiO2, ZnO, gamma-Al2O3, are proposed as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidative degradation of chemical warfare agents (CWA), particularly of organosulfur toxic agents, into oxidised products with reduced toxicity. The morphology, structural and textural properties of the catalysts were investigated. Furthermore, their catalytic properties were evaluated in the oxidative abatement of (2-chloroethyl)ethylsulfide, CEES, a simulant of sulfur mustard (blistering CWA). Their performance was also compared to a conventional decontamination powder and a commercial Nb2O5 sample. The metal oxides powders were then employed in the active oxidative decontamination of CEES from a cotton textile substrate, mimicking a real contamination occurrence. Remarkable results in terms of abatement and degradation into desired products were recorded, achieving good conversions and decontamination efficiency with Nb2O5, TiO2 and gamma-Al2O3, under very mild conditions, with hydrogen peroxide (as aqueous solution or as urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct), at room temperature and ambient pressure. In the aim of a real on-field use, the potential environmental impact of these solids was also evaluated by bioluminescence toxicity tests on reference bacteria (Photobacterium leiognathi Sh1), showing a negligible negative impact for TiO2, gamma-Al2O3, and Nb2O5. A major biotoxic effect was only found for ZnO. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
