TI Synergistic doping and tailoring: Realizing in depth modulation on
   valence state of CoFe spinel oxide for high-efficiency water oxidation
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Modifying the valence of metal active center to the favorable configuration offers a promising strategy to promote the electrocatalytic performance of water splitting. For example, Co2+ is reported to show better performance of water oxidation than Co3+ in the Co-based spinel oxide, but its adjustment degree is small due to the geometrical occupation and the uniform synthetic environment. In this work, on the basis of chemical tailoring for the Ni-doped CoFe Prussia blue precursor, we demonstrate an inverse spinel NiCoFe oxide with dominant Co2+ (NiCoII(5)Fe-ONC). Interestingly, the introduction of Ni can promote the valence modulation in depth, which suggests the superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the well-balanced and Co2+-rich CoFe oxide. Electrochemical measurements show that NiCoII(5)Fe-ONC can afford a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of only 220 mV in alkali, which is much better than that of RuO2. The robust catalytic performance results from the increased active sites, facile electron transfer and favorable adsorption/ desorption of intermediate products. The synergistic effect of Ni-doping and chemical tailoring on valence configuration has been studied in detail. This work provides a potential method to develop high-efficiency electrocatalysts and expands researchers' access to the 3d transition-metal catalysts in favor of valence engineering.

TI Internal Doping and Surface Coating: Mn/La-HCF @ Fe-HCF Composites as
   High-Performance Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO NANO
AB Manganese-based Prussian blue analogue (Mn-HCF) has outstanding advantages such as a high discharge platform, high discharge capacity and high energy density compared with other PB and PBAs, which is a very valuable cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, the rapid decrease in capacity in the cycle process by the Jahn-Teller effect caused by Mn3+ is the main obstacle to the commercialization of Mn-HCF. In this work, Mn/La-HCF @ Fe-HCF was synthesized by doping La element into the Mn-HCF phase to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn ions and coating the Fe-HCF phase outside to protect the Mn-HCF phase from electrolyte corrosion. Benefiting from the inhibition of the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ by the abundant electronic energy level structure of La element and the protection of Fe-HCF phase relative to Mn-HCF phase, the initial discharge capacity of Mn/La-HCF @ Fe-HCF can reach 135.6 mAh g(-1) at current density of 0.1 C, and it still has a high discharge capacity of 112.2mAh g(-1) at current density of 5 C. After 300 cycles at a current density of 2 C, the reversible capacity of 117.6mAh g(-1) is maintained (capacity retention rate is 86.1%). The results show that this method of internal doping and outsourcing can greatly improve the electrochemical performance of Mn-HCF, and provide feasible ideas for the commercialization of Mn-HCF.

TI The electrochemical activity of the nitrosyl ligand in copper
   nitroprusside: a new possible redox mechanism for lithium battery
   electrode materials?
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The unconventional redox mechanism of copper nitroprusside in the electrochemical reaction with lithium is studied by a wide range of techniques. After a simple and reproducible synthesis, pristine copper nitroprusside is characterized using a wide range of techniques. The material is formulated and electrochemically tested in coin cells to explore its electrochemical signature and cyclability. Multiple redox processes involving both Fe and Cu centres are identified at an early stage and further investigated by operando XAFS. Moreover, operando FTIR unveils the unexpected participation of the nitrosyl ligand in the electrochemical reaction. A gradual and irreversible transformation of the material, also reported by operando Mossbauer spectroscopy, occurs in the first cycles. Then, the material is able to withstand several electrochemical cycles without efficiency loss, even though no optimization on formulation has been carried out. Altogether, the nitrosyl group is electrochemically active beyond metals' centres, giving as result a remarkable increase in capacity compared to other analogue compounds. We thus believe this study may open the way to further research on other electroactive nitrosyl-containing materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Lattice Compensation to Jahn-Teller Distortion in Na-Rich Manganese
   Hexacyanoferrate for Li-Ion Storage: An Operando Study
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) has received increasing attention as a positive electrode for either lithium- or sodium-ion storage owing to its high specific capacity among the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). During ion release, the material undergoes the Jahn-Teller distortion arising from the oxidation of manganese to its trivalent state. Typically, the Jahn-Teller distortion is reported to destabilize the host structure of electrode materials based on layered and spinel manganese oxides, resulting in volume changes in the order of 10-20%, which deteriorate the cycle performance. Herein, the effect of such a distortion on MnHCF via operando, synchrotron powder diffraction is reported. Surprisingly, only a minor volume change (about 2%) is recorded upon cycling the electrode material against lithium, highlighting the major role of the PBA framework in stabilizing the PBAs' structures.

TI Novel Dual-Signal SiO2-COOH@MIPs Electrochemical Sensor for
   Highly Sensitive Detection of Chloramphenicol in Milk
SO SENSORS
AB In view of the great threat of chloramphenicol (CAP) to human health and the fact that a few producers have illegally used CAP in the food production process to seek economic benefits in disregard of laws and regulations and consumer health, we urgently need a detection method with convenient operation, rapid response, and high sensitivity capabilities to detect CAP in food to ensure people's health. Herein, a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensor based on a dual-signal strategy was designed for the highly sensitive analysis of CAP in milk. The NiFe Prussian blue analog (NiFe-PBA) and SnS2 nanoflowers were modified successively on the electrode surface to obtain dual signals from [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) at 0.2 V and NiFe-PBA at 0.5 V. SiO2-COOH@MIPs that could specifically recognize CAP were synthesized via thermal polymerization using carboxylated silica microspheres (SiO2-COOH) as carriers. When the CAP was adsorbed by SiO2-COOH@MIPs, the above two oxidation peak currents decreased at the same time, allowing the double-signal analysis. The SiO2-COOH@MIPs/SnS2/NiFe-PBA/GCE sensor used for determining CAP was successfully prepared. The sensor utilized the interactions of various nanomaterials to achieve high-sensitivity dual-signal detection, which had certain innovative significance. At the same time, the MIPs were synthesized using a surface molecular imprinting technology, which could omit the time of polymerization and elution and met the requirements for rapid detection. After optimizing the experimental conditions, the detection range of the sensor was 10(-8) g/L-10(-2) g/L and the limit of detection reached 3.3 x 10(-9) g/L (S/N = 3). The sensor had satisfactory specificity, reproducibility, and stability, and was successfully applied to the detection of real milk samples.

SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Traditional chemiluminescence (CL) imaging immunoassays usually rely on natural enzymes as catalytic probes, which has hampered their extensive application due to the susceptibility to inactivation of natural enzymes. In response, a gold brocade coated CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe PBA@Au brocade) with enhanced peroxidase-like activity was synthesized and utilized as a powerful label probe for constructing a highly sensitive CL imaging immunosensor targeting disease biomarkers with excellent performance. This research offers a universal strategy for enhancing the sensitivity of CL imaging immunoassays and further expands the application of PBA nanozymes.

TI A strategy for designing low-cost, environment-friendly, high energy and
   power density sodium-ion full cells: Effect of extrinsic
   pseudocapacitance
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In this work, we demonstrate the advantage of introducing extrinsic pseudocapacitance behavior in the active material for designing low-cost, high energy, and power density sodium-ion full cells. Here, tin and antimony based alloy nanopowder is synthesized via microwave assisted hydrothermal process (MAHP) for use as a negative electrode. Ex-situ x-ray diffraction studies reveal that the alloy nanopowder stores Na+ via a diffusion-controlled alloying mechanism. Extrinsic pseudocapacitance behavior is subsequently introduced by sandwiching the alloy nanopowder between nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets via MAHP. When coupled with a diffusion-controlled positive electrode comprising of an iron-based prussian blue analog, the resulting full cell demonstrates a high energy density of 262.5 Wh kg(-1) at 1C rate with 85.7% capacity retention at the end of 100 cycles. Detailed cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance studies provide insight into the effect of extrinsic pseudocapacitance in improving the electrochemical performance of the full cell.

TI Medium- and high-entropy materials as positive electrodes for sodium-ion
   batteries: Quo Vadis?
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Medium- and High-entropy materials (MEMs/HEMs) have garnered growing global research attention due to their distinctive structural characteristics and the correlated opportunities for customizing functional properties, which hold the potential to drive advancements in various energy conversion and storage technologies. Such a new class of materials breaks through the traditional design concept of low entropy-based materials. Recently, the library of MEMs and HEMs was further expanded, encompassing positive electrode materials for sodium -ion batteries (SIBs) such as layered transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds (NASICON-type, Alluaudite polyphosphates, fluorophosphates, mixed phosphates, etc.) and Prussian blue analogues. Taking into account such significant progress, herein, the recently developed MEMs and HEMs for SIBs, including synthesis methods and their performances as cathode materials are reviewed. In addition, the effective strategies and promising trends for rationally designing MEMs and HEMs, as well as the roles of multielement and their synergistic effects on the electrochemical performance are discussed. Finally, the challenges, prospects, and Quo Vadis? in designing MEMs and HEMs provide guidance for the development of new and improved cathode materials to pave the way for future energy storage advancements.

TI Synergistic multiple active species for catalytic self-cleaning membrane
   degradation of persistent pollutants by activating peroxymonosulfate
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Recently, the development of dual functional catalytic membrane for the synergistic degradation and filtration of persistent pollutants has attracted considerable attention in environmental remediation. Herein, novel CoFe alloy and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped microtube composites (CoFe-NMTs) were firstly fabricated through in-situ pyrolysis of simple-source Prussian blue analogues (PBA). As expected, this unique structure not only inhibited the nanoparticles agglomeration, but also provided a "highway" that accelerated the Co3+/Co2+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycles. Therefore, CoFe-NMT-800 (0.1 g/L, pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C) achieved over 90% tetracycline (TC, 30 mg/L, 0.1821 min(-1)) removal after 30 min at a wide pH (2.55-9.55) by coupling with peroxymonosulfate (PMS, 0.3 g/L), which dramatically outperformed the majority of the reported catalysts (such as Co3O4, CoFe alloy, CoFe2O4 and N-doped carbon nanotubes, etc.). Additionally, CoFe-NMTs-800 also exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the existence of inorganic anions (Cl-, HCO3 and H2PO4-) and natural organic matters (humic acid (HA)). Subsequently, CoFe-NMTs-800 was immobilized into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane as catalytic self-cleaning membrane via applying phase-inversion technology. It was found that CoFe-NMTs-800/PVDF membrane not only maintained high removal efficiency for TC degradation (over 90%) in TC/HA coexistence system, but also effectively eliminated the adverse effect of membrane fouling. Besides, the fabricated membrane also showed desirable reusability and neglectable metal leaching (0.003 mg/L Fe and 0.015 mg/L) with almost constant flux after five cycles. The quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results clearly indicated that sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-), hydroxyl radicals (.OH and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) were responsible for TC degradation and SO4 center dot- was a major contributor. Significantly, this work was very meaningful to construct novel catalytic self-cleaning membrane for water purification. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB Three different metal hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (M-HCF-NPs, M = In3+, Fe3+, and Mn2+) were characterized by XRD, SEM, elemental analyses, IR and isotherm measurements. The obtained M-HCF-NPs prepared by a simple mixing procedure have a Prussian blue-type cubic crystal structure and sizes of around 20 nm. The chemical compositions measured by the elemental analyses are In-HCF = K0.039In[Fe(CN)(6)](0.75)center dot Cl-0.032 center dot 3.8H(2)O, Fe-HCF (PB) = K0.18Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.80)center dot 3.8H(2)O, and Mn-HCF = K1.3Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.84)center dot 1.3H(2)O. Ammonia gas iso-therms under vacuum revealed that the ammonia adsorption capacity of the M-HCF-NPs is in order of Mn < In " Fe; however, the ammonia gas adsorption of In-HCF-NPs is faster than those of the Fe-HCF and MnHCF-NPs. This difference is considered to be caused by individual M-HCF structures, such as the vacancies in the HCF crystals, and by the interaction of individual M-HCF toward water molecules, which promote the conversion of NH3 species into stable NH4+ cations in M-HCF.

TI Electrospun MOF-Based FeCo Nanoparticles Embedded in Nitrogen-Doped
   Mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers as an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for
   Oxygen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Zinc-Air Batteries
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Low-price, high-performance and strong-stability electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly significant in the application of clean energy devices like rechargeable zinc-air batteries and renewable fuel cells. In this paper, a Prussian blue analogue Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2).nH(2)O (Co-Fe PBA), as a well-known member of the metal-organic framework family, was electrospun into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers to obtain composite Co-Fe PBA@PAN nanofibers. Nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers encapsulated FeCo alloy nanoparticles (FeCo-NCNFs-Ts, T = 700, 800, 900 degrees C) were synthesized by pyrolysizing Co-Fe PBA@PAN precursor at different temperatures under an argon atmosphere. The effects of different calcination temperatures and mass ratios between Co-Fe PBA and PAN on ORR/OER catalytic activity were explored. Among FeCo-NCNFs-Ts, FeCo-NCNFs-800 had the highest bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with a lower reversible overvoltage of 0.869 V between ORR (E-1/2) and OER (E-j = 10 mA cm(-2)), excellent stability and methanol durability, which even exceeded those of Pt/C and RuO2. The superb bifunctional activity for FeCo-NCNFs-800 was comparable to that of non noble electrocatalysts reported in recent literatures. Moreover, the zinc-air battery based on the FeCo-NCNFs-800 air-cathode catalyst had a high power density of 74 mW cm(-2) and strong cycling stability (125 cycles for 42 h), which can be comparable to a Pt/C-RuO2 zinc-air battery. The impressive bifunctional activity on ORR and OER for the FeCo-NCNFs-800 catalyst in the zinc-air battery can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the one-dimensional fibrous structure, FeCo alloy nanoparticles, Co-N (pyridinic-N) active sites, and numerous mesopores.

AB Membrane separation technology is widely recognized as an efficient method for treating organically polluted wastewater in virtue of high performance and straightforward operation. However, the practical application of membranes is inevitably confronted with contamination issues, presenting a major challenge in terms of fouling resistance. To address this issue, a defensive-offensive dual-defense strategy based on wettability and catalytic ability control is proposed. With this concept, a novel nanofibrous membrane with a unique structure was successfully prepared through polyacrylonitrile (PAN) electrospinning, pre-oxidation, CoFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) and polypyrrole (PPy) modification, and calcination processes. For the passive defense mode, the as-prepared membrane has shown good underwater-superoleophobicity for various types of oils, good separation capability for corresponding oil-water emulsions with retention ratios of above 99 % and fluxes ranging from 231.5 to 1524.2 L center dot m-- 2 center dot h- 1 center dot bar- 1 , as well as organic solvent (dimethylformamide, DMF) resistance. For the offensive defense mode, this membrane exhibits well catalytic degradation performance for refractory pollutants with the assistance of peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which is due to the membrane being decorated with catalytic nanoparticles that contain abundant encapsulated ultra-small Fe doped Co3O4 3 O 4 ( 2.28 nm), and that is much smaller than the size of the pristine PBA ( 33.8 nm). Notably, the surfactants present in oil-in-water emulsions are found to be the main cause of membrane fouling, where the cationic surfactants exhibit the most significant fouling effect, while the introduction of photo-Fenton-like catalysis can endow the membrane with excellent antifouling performance and extended service life, and nearly a fully recover of emulsion separation performance was achieved. Overall, this work paves pathways to the design of advanced membranes for sustainable wastewater treatment.

TI Multicomponent nanohybrids of nickel ferric oxides and nickel cobaltate
   spinel derived from the MOF-on-MOF nanostructure as efficient scaffolds
   for sensitively determining insulin
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Multicomponent nanohybrids of nickel/ferric oxides and nickel cobaltate spinel (denoted as NiO/Fe2O3/NiCo2O4) have been prepared through pyrolyzing the hierarchical nanostructure of MOF-on-MOF and explored as efficient scaffolds for sensitively determining insulin. As for the MOF-on-MOF preparation, the ultra-thin bimetallic CoNi-zeolitic imidazolate framework (CoNi-ZIF) nanosheets were grown tightly around the bimetallic CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe PBA) nanocube (denoted as CoNi-ZIF@CoFePBA). Basic characterizations revealed the original core-shell structure shape was still maintained in the NiO/Fe2O3/NiCo2O4 pyrolyzed at 300 degrees C, which was composed of multi-metal oxides and NiCo2O4 spinel, along with low crystallinity. Conversely, the NiO/Fe2O3/NiCo2O4 nanohybrid calcined at 600 degrees C consisted of large amounts of nanoparticles, while the nanohyrbid obtained at 900 degrees C demonstrated aggregated NiO and Fe2O3 nanoparticles coexisted with the NiCo2O4 phase. Owing to the porous nanostructure, the synergistic effect among different components, excellently electrochemical conductivity, and good biocompatibility of the NiO/Fe2O3/NiCo2O4 nanohybrid obtained at 600 degrees C, the relevant aptasensor displayed superior sensing performance for the determination of insulin. It gave an ultra-low detection limit of 9.1 fg mL(-1) (0.16 fM) within a wide linear insulin concentration ranging from 0.01 pg mL(-1) (0.172 fM) to 100 ng mL(-1) (1.72 nM) determined by the electrochemical technique. The constructed aptasensor also had high selectivity, good stability, excellent reproducibility, and acceptable applicability in human serum. By integrating the advantages of aptasensors and electrochemical approach with features of multi-metallic metal-organic frameworks, this work widely broadens the applications of MOF-driven nanohybrids in biosensing fields.

TI Impact of Nano-sized Inorganic Fillers on PEO-based Electrolytes for
   Potassium Batteries
SO BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS
AB The low melting points of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) based on the KTFSI electrolyte salt allow comparatively low operation temperatures (below 50 degrees C) for K-ion batteries, unlike their Li or Na counterparts. Unfortunately, for this reason the electrolyte is also rendered mechanically unsuitable in its function to act as a cell separator. Therefore, in this work the use of inorganic nanofillers (Al2O3 and SiO2) is explored with the aim to improve rheological, thermal and cation transport properties of the resulting polymer composite electrolytes. Their electrochemical properties were further examined in K-metal symmetrical cells and K-metal/SPE/K2Fe[Fe(CN)6] cells and compared to corresponding liquid electrolyte systems. As a result of particle-polymer interactions, filler-containing SPEs showed higher degrees of crystallinity combined with filler polymer interaction and thus improved mechanical integrity in the relevant temperature range of 25-55 degrees C, while maintaining similar ionic conductivities than a filler-free sample above the melting temperature. Although plating-stripping experiments in symmetrical cell setups suggested high cell resistances for various compositions and in some cases even rapid cell failure, Al2O3-based SPEs generally displayed high capacity retention when cycled against a positive electrode (here Prussian blue analogue K2Fe[Fe(CN)6]) over 100-160 cycles and possibly beyond.
   Fillers: This work studies the impact of inorganic fillers on the mechanical, thermal and ionic transport properties of PEO:KTFSI polymer electrolytes for potassium-ion batteries. Compared to their filler-free congeners, PEO:KTFSI composite electrolytes exhibited higher capacity retention and longer cycle life in K/SPE/K2Fe[Fe(CN)6] cell configurations.image

TI Review of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries
SO PROGRESS IN SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB With the increasing maturity of lithium-ion battery (LIB) research and large-scale commercial application, the shortage of lithium resources has gradually emerged. Sodium-ion batteries (SIB) have become a potential choice for secondary battery energy storage systems due to their abundant resources, high efficiency, and ease of use. The cathode materials of sodium-ion batteries affect the key performance of batteries, such as energy density, cycling performance, and rate characteristics. At present, transition metal oxides, polyanion compounds, and Prussian blue compounds have been reported as cathode materials. This paper summarizes the classification, performance characteristics, and research progress of main cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, and prospects the potential research directions.

TI Interfacial Mn Vacancy for Li-Rich Mn-Based Oxide Cathodes
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Apart from the O releasing at a low rate, large polarization at a high rate is also a big challenge for Li-rich Mn-based oxide (LMO). Prussian blue (PB) with a specific redox potential is regarded as a suitable coating layer to overcome these drawbacks, while its stability is easily destroyed by the intrinsic Jahn-Teller effect after a long run. Herein, Mn vacancy (M-v) is introduced into the PB coating layer to enhance its stability. Consequently, such an electrode (M-v-PB@LMO) presents a prolonged lifespan compared to the electrode with a PB coating layer only. Furthermore, it is found that the electrode with Mn vacancy in LMO (M-v@LMO) shows superior reversibility, which displays a boosted activity of LMO. This research exhibits the advanced merits of Mn vacancy for LMO, and further work may pay more attention to strengthening of the stability of M-v@LMO.

TI Aqueous cerium ion battery: A novel aqueous rechargeable battery
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs) are a potential energy storage system with lowcost aqueous electrolyte and high safety. Multivalent host carriers in electrolyte can offer a wider variety of valence states and redox properties leading to high capacity. In this work, an aqueous cerium ion aqueous (ACIBs) battery has been reported with a satisfactory electrochemical performance for the first time. By utilizing the advantages of stable structure and three-dimensional (3D) open framework of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), the problem of cerium ions insertion/de-insertion into host materials due to high charge and large size can been successfully solved. Herein, the copper hexacyanoferrate (CuPBA) is prepared through a facile coprecipitation strategy as cathode material of ACIBs. The CuPBA cathode deliver a satisfactory capacity (79 mAh g- 1 at 50 mA g- 1) and an excellent cycling stability after long-time cycles (86.8 % capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1000 mA g- 1). As a result, the cathode material in ACIBs system displays excellent rate capability and cycling performance. The successful assemble of the full battery also verifies the feasibility of ACIBs. In addition, the energy storage mechanism of Ce3+ ion insertion/de-insertion process is explained by ex situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. This work opens up a new direction and provides a foundation for development of novel ARBs.

TI Magnetism tuned by intercalation of various metal ions in coordination
   polymer
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB Incorporation of guest ions into porous frameworks changed magnetism of the host materials significantly. However, in most cases, the guest ions were monovalent due to lack of reliable method to insert divalent and trivalent guest ions. In this work, we demonstrated that divalent and trivalent metal ions could be inserted into frameworks of a coordinate polymer, Cu-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), through electrochemical intercalation. The magnetism of the host frameworks was changed among paramagnetic, superparamagnetic, and ferromagnetic as demonstrated by physical property measurement system (PPMS). Furthermore, the magnetization of the frameworks under low temperatures correlated to the guest ions significantly. The ionic radius and net charge of the guest ions influenced the intercalation amount of the guest ions, therefore affected the valence change of Fe3+ ions in the host frameworks, finally leading to variation of the magnetism of the host materials.

TI Copper-iron ternary metal fluorides from multi-metallic template
   fluorination and their first use as cathode in solid state Li-batteries
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB Conversion cathodes such as metal fluorides are particularly interesting for their theoretical capacities up to 711 mAh/g when used in Li-ion batteries. However, they generally suffer from high hysteresis and/or poor cyclability. To overcome these problems, ternary metal fluorides are being explored to improve electrochemical properties compared to the usual binary fluorides: a polymer electrolyte membrane is also used to avoid undesirable cathode-electrolyte reactions and to assess the compatibility of such cathode materials with All Solid State Bat-teries (ASSB). Among the multi-metallic models, copper hexacyanoferrate Cu-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O from the Prussian blue analogue family (PBA), is fluorinated under pure fluorine gas at selected temperatures according to pre-liminary thermogravimetric mass spectrometry analyses. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and diffraction, an inverse perovskite structure [Cu(H2O)(4)](3 center dot)(FeF6)(2) is identified at a fluorination temperature of 140 degrees C and an intimate mixture of CuF2 and FeF3 is formed at 350 degrees C. The cyclic voltammogram of the latter compared to that of a ball-milled sample of similar composition CuF2/FeF3 highlights the advantages of MMTF multi-metallic template fluorination for electrochemical properties, interpreted by the high level of homogeneous dispersion of the redox centers obtained with this method compared to the mechanical milling reference evaluated by SEM. The fluorides are also found to be compatible with the commercial solid polymer electrolyte membrane PEO-LiTFSI (Poly Ethylene Oxide impregnated with Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), underlining the suit-ability of the MMTF-prepared cathodes for use in the ASSB.

TI A moisture-controlled Prussian white/CNT composite high energy cathode
   for next-generation sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB In this study, we present a Prussian white (Na2MnFe(CN)6)-carbon nanotube (PW-CNT) composite material with a carbon conductive network as a promising high energy cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). This cathode, which is prepared by a chelating-agent-assisted precipitation method to regulate defect crystallization, is showcased as a promising solution to the bottlenecks of high lattice defects, irreversible phase transitions, the resulting structural instability and hence unstable cycling usually present in the PW cathode for SIBs. Precisely, the PW-CNT composite formation highlights the effectively controlled moisture content achieved through the strategic integration of CNTs and a chelating agent during the material synthesis. Moreover, the electrochemical behavior and performance of PW-CNT composites, particularly in sodium-ion batteries, are explored within the context of controlled moisture environments. The intricate interplay between PW, CNTs, and the chelating agent, as well as their synergistic influence on moisture management and subsequent electrochemical performance, is thoroughly examined. At an extreme rate of 10C, the PW-CNT composite cathode exhibited a high reversible capacity of 133 mA h g-1, very close to the theoretical value (similar to 140 mA h g-1), and almost 30% higher than that of the PW (similar to 103 mA h g-1) and 1.2 times greater than that of a conventional Prussian blue (PB) cathode (similar to 58 mA h g-1), respectively. A coin-type full-cell configuration with a hard carbon (HC) anode exhibited similar to 58% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 1C thereby underscoring the potential of the PW-CNT composite cathode to advance the real-time applications for energy storage applications including SIBs.

TI Enhancing the durability of Prussian white based sodium batteries
   through the lithium salt-mediated electrode interface
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Prussian white (PW) shows potential as a cathode material for high-energy sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its advantages such as high operating voltage, high specific capacity, and cost-effectiveness. However, their practical applications are hampered by insufficient cyclic stability challenges resulting from structural collapse due to electrolyte erosion and irreversible phase transitions. Compared to the cumbersome PW modification and coating processes, we have found that the introduction of lithium salt (LiDFOB) can efficiently mediate the electrode interface. Theoretical simulations and experimental analysis results indicate that LiDFOB can not only alleviate dendritic growth issues in sodium metal anodes but also generate a low impedance interface layer rich in LiF and B-O at the cathode, mitigating problems such as electrolyte erosion, metal ion dissolution, and irreversible phase transitions. The addition of this additive significantly improves the cycle retention rate of PW from 44.92% to 71.33% over 200 cycles, while also enhancing its rate capability. These exceptional electrochemical characteristics demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating lithium salt additives into the electrolytes of SIBs, which will greatly advance the development and application of Mn-based Prussian blue analog (PBA) materials.
   LiDFOB mitigates dendritic growth in Na||PW batteries and forms a low impedance LiF and B-O rich interface at the cathode, combating electrolyte erosion, metal ion dissolution, and irreversible phase transitions.

TI Synthesis of Alkali Transition Metal Oxides Derived from Prussian Blue
   Analogues Toward Low Cationic Disorder for Li-Ion Battery Cathodes
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) cathode materials are technologically important for high energy density Li-ion batteries. However, critical issues on Li+/Ni2+ cation disorder and poor Li-ion kinetics remain challenging, hampering the commercialization. Here, we report a new synthetic method of LiNixCoyMnzO2 derived from (Na0.25K0.15)Ni2.6-xMnx[Co(CN)(6)](2) (PBA) and appealing physicochemical aspects for advanced Li-ion batteries. A chemical lithiation process is developed for an efficient phase transition of the PBA to the layered structure NCM at a relatively low calcination temperature. As-prepared NCM possesses a LiO2 slab space of 2.637 A close to an ideal value of 2.64 angstrom due to similar to 1 atom % of an extremely suppressed Li+/Ni2+ disorder, leading to enhanced reversibility of a and c lattice constant changes upon cycling. Besides, a chemical densification process is invented to obtain a well-defined cubic structure at a high calcination temperature over 700 degrees C. Resultant NCM microcubes show superior cyclability and rate capability in a wide potential window of 2.7-4.5 V versus Li/Li+. Our results demonstrate the importance of suppressing the Li-Ni cation disorder in LiNixCoyMnzO2 for the development of high energy density Li-ion batteries.

In this work, a seawater battery with ultra-high power density and ultra-stable cycling performance in seawater from 0 degrees C to 40 degrees C has been realized by using a metal as the anode and nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) as the cathode. The electrode made from NiHCF increases the output voltage of the seawater battery and shows almost no capacity fading at high current density during cycling. As a result, the seawater battery presents a high power density of over 160 mW cm(-2) and can work stably in seawater in a wide temperature range (0-40 degrees C). Experiments have proved that the seawater battery system could drive the target electric boat in an actual marine environment. This result proved that the seawater battery could potentially be applied to marine equipment.

TI The effect of 3d-electron configuration entropy on the temperature
   coefficient of redox potential in
   Co1-zMnz Prussian blue analogues
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Recently, it was reported that a thermocell can convert temperature into electrical energy by using the difference in the thermal coefficient (alpha = dV/dT) of the redox potential (V) between the cathode and anode materials. Here, we systematically investigated alpha of NaxCo1-zMnz[Fe(CN)(6)](y) (Co1-zMnz-PBA) against Mn concentration (z). The z-dependence of alpha is interpreted in terms of the 3d-electron configuration entropy (Delta S-3d) of the redox site. Utilization of S-3d is a strategy effective for the design of high-|alpha| materials for energy harvesting thermocells.

   over K2Mn[Fe(CN)6]
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB The Fenton reaction is a powerful process that can degrade pollutants in wastewater. The reaction can be enhanced by UV/visible light irradiation. Herein, a photo-Fenton catalyst, K2Mn[Fe(CN)6], was synthesized by a grinding-washing method. The photo-Fenton activity of the synthesized catalyst was evaluated through the degradation of rhodamine B, reactive orange 16, and tetracycline HCl. In the presence of H2O2, the degradation efficiency of K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] was very poor in darkness but the degradation rates for pollutant models were significantly improved by visible light irradiation. Operating parameters such as catalyst loading and concentration of H2O2 also affected the degradation rate of the pollutant models. A trapping experiment confirmed center dot OH as the dominant reactive species in the respective photo-Fenton processes. The degradation of pollutant models was investigated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Based on the experimental results, K2Mn[Fe (CN)6] could be used in water treatment initiatives in industrial areas.

TI Pseudomorphic Transformation of Interpenetrated Prussian Blue Analogs
   into Defective Nickel Iron Selenides for Enhanced Electrochemical and
   Photo-Electrochemical Water Splitting
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB A significant methodology gap remains in the construction of advanced electrocatalysts, which has collaborative defective functionalities and structural coherence that maximizes electrochemical redox activity, electrical conductivity, and mass transport characteristics. Here, a coordinative self-templated pseudomorphic transformation of an interpenetrated metal organic compound network is conceptualized into a defect-rich porous framework that delivers highly reactive and durable photo(electro)chemical energy conversion functionalities. The coordinative-template approach enables previously inaccessible synthesis routes to rationally accomplish an interconnected porous conductive network at the microscopic level, while exposing copious unsaturated reactive sites at the atomic level without electronic or structural integrity trade-offs. Consequently, porous framework, interconnected motifs, and engineered defects endow remarkable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activity due to intrinsically improved turnover frequency, electrochemical surface area, and charge transfer. Moreover, when the hybrid is coupled with a silicon photocathode for solar-driven water splitting, it enables photon assisted redox reactions, improved charge separation, and enhanced carrier transport via the built-in heterojunction and additive co-catalyst functionality, leading to a promising photo(electro)chemical hydrogen generation performance. This work signifies a viable and generic approach to prepare other functional interconnected metal organic coordinated compounds, which can be exploited for diverse energy storage, conversion, or environmental applications.

The contrast ratio at 700 nm reaches 80. The cycle stability exceeds 200 cycles. H-2 with low concentration (4%-H-2) and air can drive the change of colour between blue and colourless. We also reveal via X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy, and investigation of the redox potential of a series of metal-substituted Prussian blue analogues, that bleaching results from the reduction of Prussian blue nanoparticles by protons generated using platinum nanoparticles.

TI Tumor-Microenvironment-Triggered Ion Exchange of a Metal-Organic
   Framework Hybrid for Multimodal Imaging and Synergistic Therapy of
   Tumors
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Nanotheranostic agents (NTAs) that integrate diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic functions have great potential for personalized medicine, yet poor tumor specificity severely restricts further clinical applications of NTAs. Here, a pro-NTA (precursor of nanotheranostic agent) activation strategy is reported for in situ NTA synthesis at tumor tissues to enhance the specificity of tumor therapy. This pro-NTA, also called PBAM, is composed of an MIL-100 (Fe)-coated Prussian blue (PB) analogue (K2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)]) with negligible absorption in the near-infrared region and spatial confinement of Mn2+ ions. In a mildly acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), PBAM can be specifically activated to synthesize the photothermal agent PB nanoparticles, with release of free Mn2+ ions due to the internal fast ion exchange, resulting in the "ON" state of both T-1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and photoacoustic signals. In addition, the combined Mn2+-mediated chemodynamic therapy in the TME and PB-mediated photothermal therapy guarantee a more efficient therapeutic performance compared to monotherapy. In vivo data further show that the pro-NTA activation strategy could selectively brighten solid tumors and detect invisible lymph node metastases with high specificity.

AB We report on improved electroactivity of redox probes onto chloromethyl- and azidomethyl-substituted poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) in terms of up to a 2000-fold increased electron transfer rate. Modification of screen-printed carbon with the polymers provides a reversible electrochemical behavior of both cationic and anionic redox couples. The consequent increase in voltammetric response toward [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) couple in a neutral medium stipulates 200 times enhanced sensitivity to its structural analog Prussian blue-based nanozymes "artificial peroxidase". We believe, the combination of azide functionality enabling a versatile click chemistry with advanced electroactivity onto elaborated interfaces demonstrated in this paper is revolutionary for electrochemical (bio)sensing.

TI Research Progresses on Iron-Based Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The issues of climate change and fossil fuel depletion will promote the development and use of new green energy sources. Therefore, the energy storage system with high efficiency, low cost and safety has received more and more attention and research. Among various types of energy storage systems, secondary batteries are the best choice for storing electric energy and powering electronic devices. Currently, lithium. ion batteries (LIBs) are the most widely used. However, due to the high cost caused by the shortage and uneven distribution of lithium resources on earth, research and development of other high-performance new secondary batteries are urgently needed. Sodium element has the advantages of abundant reserves in the crust, uniformity and similar chemical properties with lithium, so sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is one of the most promising alternative secondary batteries to replace LIBs. However, problems such as larger volume of sodium ions, slower ion conduction kinetics and worse conductivity limit the realization of high performance of SIBs, which is the difficulty and focus of current research. In addition, iron is rich in reserves and environmentally friendly, and its application in SIBs has attracted extensive attention from researchers in the field of batteries. Therefore, finding good iron-based cathode materials has become an important research direction for the development of high. performance electrode materials of SIBs. This review summarizes the recent progress in the research of iron. based cathode materials for SIBs, and systematically describes and analyzes the classification of polyanionic compounds, transition metal oxides, Prussian blue and its analogues, and fluorides.

TI Modulating the pore and electronic structure for targeted recovery of
   platinum: Accelerated kinetic and reinforced coordination
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Adsorption for recovery of low-concentration platinum (Pt) from the complex composition of acidic digestates was challenging because of slow kinetic and poor affinity. It was expected to be overcome by the improvement of pore size distribution and adsorption site activity. Herein, a series of Prussian blue etchings (PBE) with porosityrich and activity-high cyano (CN) was synthesized to recover low-concentration Pt. The N2 isotherm results showed that the pore structure evolved from mesoporous to microporous. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations results revealed that the modulation of electronic structure converted FeII to FeIII in [FeII(CN)6]4-. The coexistence of micro- and meso-pore structures provided channels to accelerate adsorption and ensured PtII enrichment. The regulation of Fe valence state activated CN, which reinforced the strength of coordination interaction between Pt and Fe-CN- at N -atom. The adsorption rate and maximum capacity of PBE1 were 4.4 and 2.5 times higher than those of PB, respectively, due to the dual efficacy of accelerated kinetic and reinforced coordination. This study systematically analyzes the pivotal role of pore and electronic structure modulation in adsorption kinetic and affinity, which provides a novel strategy for PtII targeted recovery.

TI A new strategy for constructing ZIF-67@PBA core-shell 3D
   cross-heterostructures for improving fire safety of TPU at ultra-low
   addition amount
SO POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY
AB Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) has an extensive application in many different industries. However, serious fire hazards and smoke toxicity have been the main reason limiting its wide application. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to perform flame retardant and smoke suppression treatment for TPU. In recent years, metal-organic framework compounds (MOFs) have very promising application prospects in the fields of flame-retardant polymer composites. However, there is a problem of low flame-retardant efficiency for the original MOFs alone in polymer composites. It is reported the multi-level and multi-structured flame-retardant system has better flame-retardant efficiency than the traditional structures. So, the dual MOF core-shell heterostructure may have more effective heat reduction and smoke suppression than any single component. In this paper, a core-shell 3D cross-heterostructures nanohybrid (ZIF-67H@PBA) was prepared using ZIF-67H as the host MOF and Prussian blue nanocubes (PBA) as the guest MOF. It has been found that TPU/ZIF-67H@PBA composites with ultra-low additions have excellent fire safety. Compared with those of pure TPU, the peak heat release rate (PHRR), total smoke release (TSP), and smoke factor (SF) of the samples with 0.5wt% ZIF-67H@PBA were reduced by 33.6 %, 47 %, and 61 %, respectively. At the same time, a cone calorimeter (CCT), a homemade soot sampling device and a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupling with each other were constructed and used to demonstrate the most realistic effects of flame retardants in terms of smoke suppression and toxicity reduction. This work provides a new strategy to design TPU flame retardants.

TI Enhanced electrochemical performance of MnFe@NiFe Prussian blue analogue
   benefited from the inhibition of Mn ions dissolution for sodium-ion
   batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (PBM) is one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity, high voltage, and low cost. However, its cycling performance is limited by serious Mn ions dissolution during Na+ insertion/extraction. In this work, a facile in situ ion-exchange strategy is developed to synthesize sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate coated by sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate (PBM@PBN). The as-prepared PBM@PBN showed superior cyclic stability and enhanced rate capability. PBM@PBN exhibited a high reversible capacity of 126.9 mAh g(-1) (1 C), with a capacity retention of 74.3% after 800 cycles. ICP results proved that superior cyclic stability was attributed to the inhibition of Mn ions dissolution by PBN coating. Besides, PBM@PBN also exhibited enhanced rate capability, and it delivered a high capacity of 87.2 mAh g(-1) at 10 C. Ex-situ XRD proved that the PBM@PBN undergoes a reversible structural change (monoclinic <-> cubic/tetragonal) during the whole cycle. PBN coating inhibited the PBM from suffering serious Mn ions dissolution during Na+ insertion/extraction, thus ensured the framework stability of PBM during long-term cycling and contributed to the excellent electrochemical performance. The simple preparation of PBM@PBN makes it accessible for large-scale applications.

TI In situ synthesis of flower-like ZnO/ZnHCF composites for cesium removal
   from water
SO JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY
AB In this research, composites of ZnO in the form of flowers with ZnFe Prussian blue analogues were prepared by in situ synthesis, and found the synthesis conditions with maximum removal efficiency. The flower-like ZnO enhances the dispersion of the ZnHCF nanoparticles, which means that the Prussian blue analogue has higher adsorption utilisation. In addition, various adsorption experiments revealed that the adsorbent has the best adsorption capacity under neutral aqueous solution conditions and is capable of high removal rate adsorption in multi-ion aqueous solution systems. Apart from this, the adsorption process satisfies a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that chemisorption dominates, and the Langermuir adsorption model suggests that adsorption occurs on a monolayer and is favourable, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 322.4 mg/g, while adsorption is a spontaneous, heat-absorbing process. Finally, a comparison with other Prussian blue analogues revealed the potential of flower-like ZnO/ZnHCF for efficient removal of Cs+ from water.

SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB In this work, engineering a heterostructural interface into a CoP/CePO4 hybrid has been achieved from a pre-designed Co-PBA/CePO4 precursor. The new CePO4 engaged interface can regulate the electronic structure of the active CoP as well as enhance the intrinsic activity. As a result, the porous CoP/CePO4 material shows a superior electrocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a lower overpotential of 162 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 48.7 mV dec(-1). This research could widen the way of engineering heterostructural interfaces with a facile method and promote the exploration of MOF-derived heterostructural electrocatalysts.

TI Unique adsorption and desorption behaviour of ammonia gas at heating
   temperature using the Prussian blue analogue
   Zn3[Co(CN)6]2
SO INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Nanoparticles (NPs) of Zinc hexacynanocobaltate (ZnHCCo) were synthesised and characterized by analytical measurements. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed great thermal stability of the ZnHCCo NPs up to similar to 350 degrees C, even under ambient air conditions including water and oxygen. Ammonia (NH3) adsorption isotherms revealed that the ZnHCCo NPs exhibited a great adsorption capacity at room temperature. This was maintained at the heating temperatures 100-250 degrees C, in which the isotherm displayed special hysteresis curves in the adsorption/desorption processes. Based on these results, the ZnHCCo NPs were applied to NH3 gas adsorption/desorption in pressure (PSA) and temperature (TSA) swing adsorption processes by using a gas cell of FTIR, to confirm that both processes are possible. Characterisation before/after NH3 exposure, by in-situ FTIR and X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) spectroscopy under dry or humid conditions, provided an understanding of the unique NH3 adsorption/desorption behaviour. The PXRD measurements suggested a crystal structure change of the ZnHCCo NPs after NH3 adsorption. Obtained results suggested a strong NH3 affinity of ZnHCCo, even though the structure was altered by the process. Owing to its high and unique ability, usage of non-rare metals, and cost-effectiveness of zinc, ZnHCCo shows a possibility as an adsorbent for NH3 in practical applications.

TI Prussian blue analogue/KB-derived Ni/Co/KB composite as a superior
   adsorption-catalysis separator modification material for Li-S batteries
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) are gradually replacing conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), credited to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and non-toxicity. Nevertheless, the substantial capacity degradation caused by the polysulfide shuttling during charging and discharging has seriously hindered the commercialization of LSBs. Separator modification with functionalized carbon materials has been found to catalyze the breakdown of polysulfides, thereby improving the efficiency of LSBs. Herein, we synthesized Ni/Co-PBAs with KB structures to subsequently derive Ni/Co/KB composites by a carbonization process, which were later used as a modifier layer on the barrier in LSBs in order to effectively alleviate the shuttle problem. The capacity of the Ni/Co/KB composite decorated separator is found to be 1032 mAh/g at 0.5 C with a coulombic efficiency closer to 100%. In the long-term cycling capability evaluation, the initial cycle is approximately 802.9 mAh/g at 1 C, while capacity retention after 400 cycles is also 678.8 mAh/g, with a high-capacity retention rate of 84.5%. The potential of these composites as modifying materials for superior LSBs separators is verified by experimental and theoretical methods. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Facile one-step synthesis of NIR-Responsive siRNA-Inorganic hybrid
   nanoplatform for imaging-guided photothermal and gene synergistic
   therapy
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Diagnosis-guided synergistic treatment based on innovative nanomaterials is of great significance for the development of anti-cancer therapies. However, the low delivery efficiency of therapeutic gene and the inability to trigger release on demand are still major obstacles impeding its wide application. Herein, we report an ultrafast one-step method within 2 min to prepare a smart carrier, liposome-coated Prussian blue @ gold nano-flower, which is named LPAR after linking with tumor-targeting peptide. The versatile LPAR not only can respond to near-infrared (NIR) light, achieve the selective delivery and the controlled release of siRNA targeting the mutant gene of Kras at its codon-12 from Glycine (G) to Aspartic acid (D) (named as G12D mutant gene) in the malignant pancreatic tumors, but also efficiently convert the absorbed NIR light into the heat to realize gene-photothermal synergistic therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Theoretical simulation results reveal that the outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency of LPAR is mainly due to its higher electric field intensity and power density distributions. Furthermore, the LPAR possesses the capabilities for triple-modal imaging. Therefore, the developed NIR light-responsive LPAR has the potential to be served as a tumor-targeted nano-delivery system for imaging-guided synergistic therapy of cancers.

TI Three-Dimensional (3D) Ordered Macroporous Bimetallic (Mn,Fe)
   Selenide/Carbon Composite with Heterojunction Interface for
   High-Performance Sodium Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Transition-metal selenides have captured significantresearch attentionas anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to their hightheoretical specific capacities and excellent electronic conductivity.However, volumetric expansion and inferior cycle life still hindertheir practical application. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) orderedmacroporous bimetallic (Mn,Fe) selenide modified by a carbon layer(denoted as 3DOM-MnFeSe x @C) compositecontaining a heterojunction interface is fabricated through selenizinga 3D ordered macroporous Mn-based Prussian Blue analogue single crystal.The 3DOM-MnFeSe x @C exhibits hierarchicallyporous architecture with enhanced mass-transfer efficiency; MnSe andFeSe(2) particles are encapsulated into macroporous carbonframework, which can significantly promote the electronic conductivityand maintain the structural integrity. The density functional theorycalculation indicates that the heterojunction interface between MnSeand FeSe2 has been successfully engineered so that Na+ can be readily adsorbed and rapidly converted, thus promotingthe reaction kinetics and extending the cyclic life. As expected,the 3DOM-MnFeSe x @C composite deliversexcellent rate performance (277.6 mA h g(-1) at 10A g(-1)), and prolonged cycling life (191.6 mA h g(-1) even after 1000 cycles at 2 A g(-1)) as a sodium storage anode. The sodium storage mechanism of thecomposite was further investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction andex situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy characterizationtechniques.

TI Monovalent manganese based anodes and co-solvent electrolyte for stable
   low-cost high-rate sodium-ion batteries
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The demand of sustainable power supply requires high-performance cost-effective energy storage technologies. Here we report a high-rate long-life low-cost sodium-ion battery full-cell system by innovating both the anode and the electrolyte. The redox couple of manganese (I/II) in Prussian blue analogs enables a high-rate and stable anode. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering provide direct evidence suggesting the existence of monovalent manganese in the charged anode. There is a strong hybridization between cyano ligands and manganese-3d states, which benefits the electronic property for improving rate performance. Additionally, we employ an organic-aqueous cosolvent electrolyte to solve the long-standing solubility issue of Prussian blue analogs. A full-cell sodiumion battery with low-cost Prussian blue analogs in both electrodes and co-solvent electrolyte retains 95% of its initial discharge capacity after 1000 cycles at 1C and 95% depth of discharge. The revealed manganese(I/II) redox couple inspires conceptual innovations of batteries based on atypical oxidation states.

TI Alleviating mechanical degradation of hexacyanoferrate via strain
   locking during Na<SUP>+</SUP> insertion/extraction for full sodium ion
   battery
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Generation of large strains upon Na+ intercalation is one of the prime concerns of the mechanical degradation of Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs. Structural construction from the atomic level is imperative to maintain structural stability and ameliorate the long-term stability of PB. Herein, an inter nickel hexacyanoferrate (NNiFCN) is successfully introduced at the out layer of iron hexacyanoferrate (NFFCN) through ion exchange to improve structural stability through compressive stress locking by forming NNiFCN shell. Furthermore, the kinetics of sodium ion diffusion is enhanced through the built-in electric pathway. The electrochemical performance is therefore significantly improved with a remarkable long-term cycling stability over 3,000 cycles at 500 mA.g(-1) in the full sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with a maximum energy density of 91.94 Wh.g(-1), indicating that the core-shell structured NNiFCN/NFFCN could be the low-cost and high-performance cathode for full SIBs in large-scale EES applications.

TI Facile fabrication of Ni, Fe-doped δ-MnO2 derived from
   Prussian blue analogues as an efficient catalyst for stable
   Li-CO2 batteries
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Rechargeable Li-CO2 batteries are regarded as an ideal new-generation energy storage system, owing to their high energy density and extraordinary CO2 capture capability. Developing a suitable cathode to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-CO2 batteries has always been a research hotspot. Herein, Ni-Fe-delta-MnO2 nano-flower composites are designed and synthesized by in situ etching a Ni-Fe PBA precursor as the cathode for Li-CO2 batteries. Ni-Fe-delta-MnO2 nanoflowers composed of ultra-thin nanosheets possess considerable surface spaces, which can not only provide abundant catalytic active sites, but also facilitate the nucleation of discharge products and promote the CO2 reduction reaction. On the one hand, the introduction of Ni and Fe elements can improve the electrical conductivity of delta-MnO2. On the other hand, the synergistic catalytic effect between Ni, Fe elements and delta-MnO2 will greatly enhance the cycling performance and reduce the overpotential of Li-CO2 batteries. Consequently, the Li-CO2 battery based on the Ni-Fe-delta-MnO2 cathode shows a high discharge capacity of 8287 mA h g(-1) and can stabilize over 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). The work offers a promising guideline to design efficient manganese-based catalysts for Li-CO2 batteries.

TI Tailored design of high-stability
   CoMn1.5Ox@TiO2 double-wall nanocages
   derived from Prussian blue analogue for catalytic combustion of
   o-dichlorobenzene
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Double-wall nanocages of CoMn1.5Ox@TiO2 were constructed via annealing Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O@TiO2 core-shell structure, which were evaluated for the catalytic combustion reaction of o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The size of Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O nanocubes was adjusted by controlling the amount of PVP and the thickness of TiO2 shell was regulated by the Ti content. The specific surface area, acid and redox properties, catalytic activity and stability of CoMn oxide catalysts were greatly improved by establishing chainmail catalyst of CoMn1.5Ox@TiO2 double-wall nanocages. The CoMn600@0.5Ti exhibited the optimum destruction activity of o-DCB with T-50 of 341 degrees C and T-90 of 392.= degrees C because of the thickness effect of TiO2 shell and synergistic effect between CoMn1.5Ox and TiO2. CoMn600@1.0Ti with 79 nm thickness of TiO2 shell exhibited durable stability in 1500 min due to the chainmail protective role of TiO2 shell on CoMn1.5Ox core. A possible reaction mechanism involving MvK and L-H model was proposed according to the active oxygen source based on TPSR-MS, in-situ FTIR, and catalytic performance studies.

TI Nitrogen-doped carbon nanoboxes as high rate capability and long-life
   anode materials for high-performance Li-ion capacitors
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Lithium ion capacitors (LICs), lately evolved energy storage devices which integrate the merits of both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) for high energy and power densities, have attracted substantial research attention in recent years. Here, a Prussian blue analogue nanocube templating process was developed to produce N-doped carbon nanoboxes (N-CNB) as high performance anode materials for lithium ion based energy storage. The N-CNB exhibited high specific capacities and excellent rate capability and cycling performances as an anode. If paired with glucose derived carbon nanospheres (GCNS) cathodes, the N-CNB//GCNS LIC delivered a high energy density of 77.5 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 311.3 W kg(-1) and maintained a decent energy density of 40.4 Wh kg(-1) at a high power density of 112 kW kg(-1). Its cycling performances were outstanding, reaching an ultrahigh, over 100%, capacity retention of 138% after a 40,000 cycle operation at 10 A g(-1), attributable to the continuous electrochemical activation of the electrode materials. The success of the present LIC can be attributed to the advantageous nanobox structure in serving as nano-reservoirs for Li-ion to enable local, fast lithiation/delithiation and in buffering the volume expansion/shrinkage during lithiation/delithiation cycles.

TI Cubic MnS-FeS2 Composites Derived from a Prussian Blue
   Analogue as Anode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries with Long-Term
   Cycle Stability
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Cubic N,S codoped carbon coating MnS-FeS2 composites (MnS-FeS2@NSC) with a hollow structure were prepared and used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. MnS-FeS2@NSC exhibits excellent cycle performance and high rate capability and delivered a reversible capacity of 501.0 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1) with a capacity retention of 81%. More importantly, the MnS-FeS2@NSC anode holds long-term cycle stability; the capacity can remain 134.0 mAh g(-1) after 14 500 cycles at 4 A g(-1). Kinetic analysis demonstrated that Na+ storage follows a pseudocapacitive dominating process, which is ascribed to the origin of the outstanding rate performance of the MnS-FeS2@NSC material. The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the hollow structure and the N,S codoped carbon coating structure, which can reduce the diffusion distance for sodium ions and electrons, alleviate volume expansion during sodium-ion insertion/extraction, and retain the structural integrity effectively. Furthermore, a two-step sodiation processes with FeS2 sodiation prior to MnS was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra might indicate that the accumulation of the metallic elements in the preconversion reaction can accelerate the transfer of electrons and ions in the further conversion process.

TI The tremendous challenge of suitable KPF 6-based electrolytes for 4
   V-class K-metal cells
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The high reactivity of potassium metal leads to the degradation of electrolytes based on KPF6 dissolved in carbonates in K-metal cells, inducing poor electrochemical performances when a high potential positive electrode material (beyond 4 V vs. K+/K) is investigated. In this study, we use a Prussian White (PW) K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode material to compare the performances of KPF6-based electrolytes without additive or in presence of DTD (1,3,2-DioxaThiolane 2,2-Dioxide), FEC (FluoroEthylene Carbonate) or VC (Vinylene Carbonate). Focusing on 0.7 M KPF6 in EC:DEC (1:1), we show that the formation and oxidation of EGEC (Ethylene Glycol bis-(Ethyl Carbonate)) can explain the high initial irreversible capacity and low Coulombic efficiency observed upon cycling. No improvement is obtained in presence of DTD, while FEC addition addresses the high initial irreversible capacity by suppressing initial EGEC formation. However, electrolyte and potassium metal electrode ageing still occurs in presence of FEC, leading to bad capacity retention and still low Coulombic efficiency. Finally, we find that VC permits both good capacity retention and high Coulombic efficiency of PW|K cells: it suppresses efficiently EGEC formation upon cycling by forming a resistive but stable passivation layer at the surface of potassium metal, hence limiting electrolyte and potassium electrode ageing.

TI Voltammetry study of CuHCF electrode in brine solutions
SO DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
AB It is a challenge that extracting rubidium directly from the salt lakes by electrochemical method, because of the low content of rubidium ions and other complex co-existing ions in the salt lakes. Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) with good electrochemical performance in desalination and aqueous batteries, may be used as the electrode material of electrochemical extracting rubidium. In this paper, CuHCF is synthesized by one-step precipitation method by adding copper ions in K3Fe(CN)6 solution. Cyclic voltammetry is studied with the CuHCF electrode sheets in alkali metal ions and simulated brine electrolytes. The alkali metal ions insertion and de-insertion in the electrodes are mainly controlled by diffusion process with cyclic stability. The diffusion rate of K+ is the largest, Li+ the smallest. The insertion and de-insertion process are reversible in Na+, K+ and Rb+ ionic solutions. The cyclic voltammetry current of the CuHCF electrode sheet in Na+ ionic solution shows two pairs of redox peaks. The cyclic voltammetry currents of CuHCF electrode sheet in simulated brine mainly show is the peak current of that in Na+ and K+ ionic solutions.

TI Ruthenium-doped cobalt sulphide electrocatalyst derived from a
   ruthenium-cobalt Prussian blue analogue (RuCo-PBA) for an enhanced
   hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The designing of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation is essential for the practical application of water-splitting devices. With numerous electrochemical advantages, transition metal sulphides are regarded as the most promising candidates for catalysing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. In the present study, Ru-doped cobalt sulphide nanosheets, termed Co9S8/Ru@t (t = 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h), were obtained by varying the reaction time from 24 h to 72 h from a RuCo-PBA precursor. The role of the time period for the synthesis of Co9S8/Ru@48h is vital in increasing the number of electroactive sites and optimising the hydrogen adsorption-desorption phenomena leading to an increment in the HER activity. The electrochemical outcomes demonstrate that the optimized Co9S8/Ru@48h requires a low overpotential of just 94 mV to produce 10 mA cm-2 current density, and also exhibits a lower Tafel slope value of 84 mV dec-1 defining its faster reaction kinetics. The as-synthesized Co9S8/Ru@48h was stable for up to 20 h of constant electrolysis signifying its outstanding durability. The optimized synthetic approach and impressive electrochemical results make Co9S8/Ru@48h a suitable alternative to noble-metal-based electrocatalysts for the HER.
   RuCo-PBA-derived Ru-doped Co9S8 nanosheets, i.e. Co9S8/Ru@48h, serve as excellent electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), requiring only a small overpotential of 94 mV to deliver the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm-2.

TI Organic electrolyte-based rechargeable zinc-ion batteries using
   potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate as a cathode material
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB This study demonstrates an organic electrolyte-based rechargeable zinc-ion battery (ZIB) using Prussian blue (PB) analogue potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate K0.86Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.954)(H2O)(0.766) (KNF-086) as the cathode material. KNF-086 is prepared via electrochemical extraction of potassium ions from K1.51Ni [Fe(CN)(6)](0.954)(H2O)(0.766) (KNF-151). The cell is composed of a KNF-086 cathode, a zinc metal anode, and a 0.5 M Zn(ClO4)(2) acetonitrile electrolyte. This cell shows a reversible discharge capacity of 55.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C rate with the discharge voltage at 1.19 V (vs. Zn2+/Zn). As evidenced by Fourier electron density analysis with powder XRD data, the zinc-inserted phase is confirmed as Zn0.32K0.86Ni [Fe(CN)(6)](0.954)(H2O)(0.766) (ZKNF-086), and the position of the zinc ion in ZKNF-086 is revealed as the center of the large interstitial cavities of the cubic PB. Compared to KNF-086, ZKNF-086 exhibits a decreased unit cell parameter (0.9%) and volume (2.8%) while the interatomic distance of d(Fe-C) increased (from 1.84 to 1.98 angstrom), and the oxidation state of iron decreases from 3 to 2.23. The organic electrolyte system provides higher zinc cycling efficiency (>99.9%) than the aqueous system (ca. 80%). This result demonstrates an organic electrolyte-based ZIB, and offers a crucial basis for understanding the electrochemical intercalation chemistry of zinc ions in organic electrolytes.

TI In Situ Fe-Substituted Hexacyanoferrate for High-Performance Aqueous
   Potassium Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB The eco-friendliness, safety, and affordability of aqueous potassium batteries (AKIBs) have made them popular for large-scale energy storage devices. However, the cycling and rate performance of research materials, particularly cobalt hexacyanoferrate, have yet to meet satisfactory standards. Herein, a room-temperature drafted K1.66Fe0.25Co0.75[Fe(CN)(6)] center dot 0.83H(2O) (KFCHCF) sample is reported using an in situ substitution strategy. A higher concentration of ferrocyanide ions decreases the water content and increases the potassium content, while citric acid works as a chelating agent and is responsible for Fe-substitution in the KFCHCF sample. The resultant KFCHCF sample exhibits good rate performance, and about 97% and 90.6% of discharge capacity are conserved after 400 and 1000 cycles at 100 and 200 mA g(-1), respectively. The full cell using the KFCHCF cathode and 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride-derived polyimide (PNTCDA) anode maintains approximate to 74.93% and 74.35% of discharge capacity at 200 mA g(-1) and 1000 mA g(-1) for 1000 and >10,000 cycles, respectively. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations demonstrate the high reversibility of K-ions and structural stability during the charge-discharge process. Such high performance is attributed to the fast K-ion migration and crystal structure stabilization caused by in situ Fe-substitution in the KFCHCF sample. Other hexacyanoferrates can be synthesized using this method and used in grid-scale storage systems.

TI Nonmetal (S or Se)-Bridged Core Shell Electrodes for Promoting
   Electrochemical Performance
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB To meet strategic applications, rational design of advanced electrochemical materials would solve the poor electrochemical performance of core-shell electrodes caused by the weak interfacial interaction between core and shell. Herein, two novel core-shell electrodes LCCH-S@PBAs and LCCH-Se@PBAs are fabricated with a nonmetal (S or Se) bridging the core and shell. Electrochemical tests show that the as-synthesized electrodes, especially LCCH-S@PBAs, present higher mass-specific capacitance with 10.1 C cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2), which is much better than that of PBA-based homologs. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show that the bridging S or Se in the interface, not only tune electronic nature of the d-states of metal ions in core and shell, but also form ionic bonds (M-1(LCCH)-S-M-2(PBAs) and M-1(LCCH)-Se-M-2(PBAs)) which facilitates the transmission of electrons, thus making a substantial enhancement of electrochemical performance via a dynamically more favorable pathway. The comparison with LCCH-C@PBAs, in which the rGO is connected with core and shell by Van der Waals' forces, also suggests the outstanding role of ionic bonds for electrochemical performance. This work proves that nonmetal bridging structures make a great contribution for enhanced electrochemical performance and demonstrates the large space to modulate the nonmetal bridging status for core-shell structures in electrochemical materials.

TI Aging and Charge Compensation Effects of the Rechargeable Aqueous
   Zinc/Copper Hexacyanoferrate Battery Elucidated Using In Situ X-ray
   Techniques
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The zinc/copper hexacyanoferrate (Zn/CuHCF) cell has gained attention as an aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion battery (ZIB) owing to its open framework, excellent rate capability, and high safety. However, both the Zn anode and the CuHCF cathode show unavoidable signs of aging during cycling, though the underlying mechanisms have remained somewhat ambiguous. Here, we present an in-depth study of the CuHCF cathode by employing various X-ray spectroscopic techniques. This allows us to distinguish between structure-related aging effects and charge compensation processes associated with electroactive metal centers upon Zn2+ ion insertion/deinsertion. By combining high-an annular dark-field-scanning electron transmission microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and elemental analysis, we reconstruct the picture of both the bulk and the surface. First, we identify a set of previously debated X-ray diffraction peaks appearing at early stages of cycling (below 200 cycles) in CuHCF. Our data suggest that these peaks are unrelated to hypothetical ZnxCu1-xHCF phases or to oxidic phases, but are caused by partial intercalation of ZnSO4 into graphitic carbon. We further conclude that Cu is the unstable species during aging, whose dissolution is significant at the surface of the CuHCF particles. This triggers Zn2+ ions to enter newly formed Cu vacancies, in addition to native Fe vacancies already present in the bulk, which causes a reduction of nearby metal sites. This is distinct from the charge compensation process where both the Cu2+/Cu+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couples participate throughout the bulk. By tracking the K-edge fluorescence using operando XAS coupled with cyclic voltammetry, we successfully link the aging effect to the activation of the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple as a consequence of Cu dissolution. This explains the progressive increase in the voltage of the charge/discharge plateaus upon repeated cycling. We also find that SO42- anions reversibly insert into CuHCF during charge. Our work clarifies several intriguing structural and redox-mediated aging mechanisms in the CuHCF cathode and pinpoints parameters that correlate with the performance, which will hold importance for the development of future Prussian blue analogue-type cathodes for aqueous rechargeable ZIBs.

TI Ligand-Promoted Cooperative Electrochemical Oxidation of Bio-Alcohol on
   Distorted Cobalt Hydroxides for Bio-Hydrogen Extraction
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Hydrogen is increasingly viewed as a game-changer in the clean energy sector. Renewable hydrogen production from water is industrialized by integrating water electrolysis and renewable electricity, but the current cost of water-born hydrogen remains high though. An ideal scenario would be to produce value-added chemicals along with hydrogen so the cost can be partially offset. Herein, facilitated bio-hydrogen extraction and biomass-derived chemical formation from sugar-derived 5-hydroxymethyfurfural (HMF) were achieved via the in-situ transformation of cobalt-bound electrocatalysts. The cyanide-bound cobalt hydroxide exhibited a low voltage at 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for bio-hydrogen production, compared with an iridium catalyst (1.75 V). The interaction between the biomass intermediate and the cyanide ligand is suggested to be responsible for the improved activity.

TI Low Defect FeFe(CN)6 Framework as Stable Host Material for
   High Performance Li-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Low cost and high performance Li-ion batteries have been extensively pursued for grid-scale energy storage applications; however, their development has been impeded fora long time due to the lack of qualified cathode materials with not only decent electrochemical performance but also resource abundance and low price. In this paper, we report Prussian-blue type FeFe(CN)(6) nanocrystals with well-controlled lattice defects and perfect nanocubic morphology, which can exhibit a high Li-storage capacity of 160 mAh g(-1), a strong rate performance at 24 C, and a superior cycle stability with 90% capacity retention over 300 cycles. This low defect lattice and its excellent Li-insertion performance might provide a new insight into the design of advanced Li-ion battery materials and also a competitive alternative to the presently developed Li+ insertion cathodes to develop low cost and high performance Li-ion batteries for grid-scale energy storage, applications.

TI Preparation of hollow Fe-Al binary metal oxyhydroxide for efficient
   aqueous fluoride removal
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Fluoride contamination of drinking water, which causes fluorosis and neurological damage, is an exigent worldwide problem. Adsorption by metal oxyhydroxides is an attractive technology for water defluorination, although the removal efficiency is restricted by protonation of the oxygen binding sites (M-OH and M-O-M) for F-. Herein, hollow Fe-Al binary metal oxyhydroxide micro-boxes (FeAl-OOH MB) were prepared by annealing derivatives of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). XRD and Al-27 MAS NMR analyses showed that the hollow structures were composed of Al oxyhydroxides (Al(O)(6), Al(O)(4)) and Al incorporated ferrihydrite. The surface oxygen was easily protonated in the presence of Al oxyhydroxides; with the introduction of Al into the lattice, the extent of protonation on the surface of the ferrihydrite was intensified via weakening the electronegativity of Fe sites. Therefore the limitation on adsorption efficiency was alleviated through tuning the surface charge. Together with large specific surface area (242 m(2) g(-1)) and good mass diffusion, hollow FeAl-OOH MB exhibited outstanding maximum F-adsorption capacity (146.59 mg g(-1)) and adsorption rate (20 min was needed to reach equilibrium for initial F concentration of 10 mg L-1), outperforming comparable metal oxyhydroxide/oxide adsorbents. Meanwhile, except for PO43-, co-existing anions (NO3-, SO42- and HCO3-) showed negligible influence on the adsorption of F- on FeAl-OOH MB. Furthermore, the F- adsorbed on FeAl-OOH MB could be effectively desorbed using 0.1 M NaOH, and the desorption efficiency for reuse was 94.38%. The results illustrate the potential utility of hollow FeAl-OOH MB as an effective adsorbent for practical defluorination in drinking water treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Improving the onset potential and Tafel slope determination of
   earth-abundant water oxidation electrocatalysts
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB To date, a plethora of electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) have been proposed. For evaluating their electrocatalytic behavior the determination of the onset potential in each studied electrolyte is a key parameter. Nevertheless, this evaluation becomes particularly problematic for first transition metal catalysts as well as by the use of electroactive collectors (e.g. Ni foams) whose redox peaks overlap the onset potential. A usual solution to detect the onset potential requires the availability of in-situ mass spectrometric determination of the generated oxygen. In this work, we present fast and easier available cyclic voltammetry and coulovoltammetric responses to determine the onset potentials of three benchmark electrocatalysts: a layered double hydroxide, a Prussian blue analogue and a beta-Layered hydroxide. Cyclic coulovoltammetric responses allow, as we demonstrate here, a quantitative separation in the same potential range of the charge consumed by reversible (redox) reactions and the charge consumed by the irreversible reaction: the oxygen release. Quantifying the irreversible charges (that correspond to the OER) for different anodic potential limits permits the unambiguous determination of both, the onset potential and the Tafel slope values without the catalyst redox contributions. As far as we know, this is the first time that this fast, available and cheap methodology has been applied for the OER determination. Thus, coulovoltammetry arises as a friendly and powerful tool for the investigation of electrocatalytic performances. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI A 3-V high-voltage and long-life magnesium-potassium hybrid ion battery
SO IONICS
AB Magnesium-ion batteries are promising candidates for the next-generation energy storage systems. However, their development is restricted by the shortage of advanced insertion-type positive electrodes. Hybrid-ion batteries, which combine the facile alkali metal ions extraction/insertion of the cathode with the low-cost and high-safety magnesium metal anode, can harness the individual benefits of both electrodes and achieve satisfactory electrochemical performance. We present a high-performance magnesium-potassium hybrid ion battery utilizing a magnesium-potassium hybrid ion electrolyte, a magnesium metal anode, and a Prussian blue analogue cathode. The battery exhibits a discharge voltage of up to 3.0 V and delivers a reversible specific capacity of 120 mAh/g, resulting in an impressive energy density of 360 Wh/kg (based on the cathode mass only). Moreover, the battery demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, maintaining a capacity retention rate of 96% after 500 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 50 mA/g. The reaction mechanism and energy storage mechanism of the hybrid ion battery were studied using various electrochemical testing methods and X-ray diffraction analysis. This work may provide new ideas and inspire the effort for the advancement of superior magnesium hybrid ion batteries.

SO SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES
AB A tertiary battery, which is charged by temperature change, has two performance indexes: the thermally induced voltage (V-cell) and discharge capacity (Q(cell)). Among them, Qcell is determined by the electrode parameters such as charge coefficient [ss(+) (ss_)] of redox potential (V) and weight [m+ (m(+)(m(-))] of the active material in the cathode (anode). In this report, we optimized electrode parameters to maximize Q(cell) of NaxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](0.88)/NaxCd[Fe (CN)(6)](0.99) tertiary battery. By this optimization, Qcell reaches 4.9 mAh/g between 293 K and 312 K.

TI From lithium to potassium: Comparison of cations in poly(ethylene
   oxide)-based block copolymer electrolytes for solid-state alkali metal
   batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Liquid electrolytes (LEs) commonly show severe side reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface, especially with alkali metal anodes, leading to rapid capacity fade of metal-ion batteries. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), however, contribute to the suppression of side reactions due to their inherent inertness and high mechanical strength, providing long-term stable battery operation. Herein, we investigated physical and electrochemical properties of SPEs based on our previously reported microphase-separated poly(vinyl benzyl methoxy poly (ethylene oxide) ether)-block-polystyrene block copolymer (PVBmPEO-b-PS) with different alkali metal ions (A+ = Li+, Na+ or K+) and their use in the respective metal batteries, showing the potential for the transition from lithium to post-lithium batteries. Rheological and thermal properties as well as ion transport in the SPEs with different bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) salts concentrations revealed similar shear storage moduli (G') for the investigated SPEs, while the lowest glass transition temperatures (Tg) were found for KTFSI-based films. By contrast, the highest total ionic conductivity was found for the LiTFSI-based SPEs. To quantify the A+ transference numbers (TA+), the Bruce-Vincent method and pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR were conducted, revealing significant challenges for TA+ determination of post-Li systems. Further, the examination of the interfacial stability of SPE/A interfaces by conducting plating/stripping experiments revealed significantly higher resistances for sodium- and potassium-based systems in comparison to their lithium-based counterpart. Nonetheless, A-metal/SPE/cathode cells with PVBmPEO-b-PS-based Na- and K-SPEs with the Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs, Na2-xFe[Fe(CN)6] and K2-xFe[Fe(CN)6]) positive electrodes and the respective alkali metal negative electrodes enabled cycling at elevated temperature of 55 degrees C. Herein, both sodium and potassium metal batteries exhibited stable cycling with capacity retentions of 73% over 100 cycles for the Na-cell, and 94% over the same cycle number for the K-cell, (and a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98% at the 100th cycle).

TI Synthesis, characterization, and photo-Fenton activity of
   Bi[Fe(CN)6]•4H2O
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB The Fenton reaction has been widely used in wastewater treatment processes, and the reaction rate is improved by irradiation with light. In this work, Bi[Fe(CN)6]center dot 4H2O was synthesized as a photo -Fenton catalyst by precipitation at room temperature without any stabilizer or capping agent. Two synthesis routes were used and compared; one using K3[FeIII(CN)6] solution and the other using K4[FeII(CN)6]. When Bi(NO3)3 solution was mixed with K3[FeIII(CN)6] solution, the Bi[Fe(CN)6]center dot 4H2O was obtained. However, the KBi(H2O)2[Fe(CN)6]center dot H2O was first precipitated by the reaction of Bi3+ with [FeII(CN)6]4-, and this intermediate was transformed into Bi[Fe (CN)6]center dot 4H2O. Compared with Bi[Fe(CN)6]center dot 4H2O prepared with K3[FeIII(CN)6], the photo -Fenton degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) with Bi[Fe(CN)6]center dot 4H2O prepared with K4[FeII(CN)6] exhibited a higher activity. It attributed to a smaller particles size of Bi[Fe(CN)6]center dot 4H2O prepared with K4[FeII(CN)6]. Although Bi[Fe(CN)6]center dot 4H2O could degrade RhB in darkness, its activity increased under visible light irradiation. The prepared catalyst also degraded reactive orange 16 (RO) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) under visible light irradiation. The degradations of RhB, RO, and TC were confirmed by mass spectrometry. From experimental results, the Bi[Fe (CN)6]center dot 4H2O prepared with K4[FeII(CN)6] showed high activity and promise as a catalyst for wastewater treatment.

TI Prussian blue analogues derived magnetic FeCo@GC material as
   high-performance metallic peroxymonosulfate activators to degrade
   tetrabromobisphenol A over a wide pH range
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Metal-organic frame (MOF) materials can effectively degrade organic pollutants, whereas the MOF is rapidly hydrolysed in water and has poor stability and low reusability. However, in the current advanced oxidation process (AOP) system, the removal effect of pollutants under alkaline condition is not ideal. In this study, a magnetic composite material derived from MOF was synthesised and used as a new catalyst for rapid degradation of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). Compared to precarbonisation, FeCo@ GC formed a conductive graphite carbon skeleton, retained the complete rhombododecahedron structure, had a larger specific surface area and provided more active sites for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The target pollutant TBBPA (20 mg/L) was completely degraded within 30 min, and the mineralisation rate reached 40.98% in the FeCo@ GC (150 mg/L) and PMS (1 mM) systems, owing to the synergistic interaction between Fe, Co and graphite carbon. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the reaction were determined to be SO4 center dot-, center dot OH, O-1(2) and O-2(center dot-) by electron paramagnetic resonance and free radical scavenging experiments, and the O-1(2) played a dominant role. Based on the results of LC-MS analysis results, the main degradation pathways of TBBPA involve three mechanisms: the debromination reaction, hydroxylation and cleavage of the benzene ring. In addition, compared with previous AOP systems, FeCo@ GC/PMS overcomes the disadvantage of poor degradation effect of TBPPA under alkaline conditions, has a wide range pH (3-11) application and has the best effect on TBBPA degradation under alkaline conditions. FeCo@GC has an excellent cycle performance, with a removal rate of re-calcined material of 88.52% after five cycles. Therefore, FeCo@GC can be used as a promising and efficient catalyst for removing environmental organic pollutants.

The reversible redox couples of Fe and Ti could provide 136.7mAhg(-1) at 50mAg(-1) and 113mAhg(-1) at lOOmAg(-1) in the first discharge. Considering that this material is easy to synthesize, with low cost and good electrochemical performance, our results suggest the possible development of KIBs as cathodes and future research into rechargeable KIBs.

TI A novel molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor based on Prussian
   blue analogue generated by iron metal organic frameworks for highly
   sensitive detection of melamine
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB A novel electrochemical sensor based on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and iron metal-organic frameworks was fabricated for highly sensitive detection of melamine (MEL) in this work. MIL-53(Fe), a kind of iron metal-organic frameworks, was prepared by a simple solvothermal method. The molecularly imprinted polymer films with specific recognition sites were synthesized by electropolymerization using methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomers interacted with MEL as templates. MIL-53(Fe) was characterized by XRD and FT-IR. The morphology of the MIP modified electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Under the optimal conditions, the molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor (MIECS) shows a wide linear range of 10(-11) M to 10(-6) M for MEL with a detection limit (3 sigma) as low as 8.21 x 10(-12) M. Moreover, the MIP sensor shows high selectivity for melamine, good reproducibility and stability. The MIECS has been applied to the real detection of melamine in liquid milk samples with satisfying results. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Hierarchical Fe Doped Co Oxide/Hydroxide Nanosheet Arrays as Highly
   Efficient Oxygen Evolution Catalysts Prepared by Hydrothermal Etching of
   FeCo Prussian Blue Analogue
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Earth-abundant metal oxides/hydroxides have recently been identified as promising catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, while the overall efficiency is still limited by the sluggish kinetics. Therefore, searching for facile and effective method to prepare composition and morphology tunable catalyst, as well as understanding its reactivity are urgent tasks. Here, we report a hydrothermal etching strategy for the synthesis of Fe doped Co oxides/hydroxide hybrid catalyst with hierarchical nanosheet array architecture. The as-obtained catalyst shows an overpotential of 219 mV without iR compensation at 10 mA/cm(2) and a low Tafel slope of 46.4 mV/dec, surpassing the other control catalysts in this work and most similar catalysts in literature. Comprehensive studies confirm that both composition and morphology can be rationally tuned by adjusting the hydrothermal etching parameters, and the improvement of activity is attributed to the highly active Fe doped Co oxides/hydroxide species together with the unique 3D hierarchical structure.

TI Historical Pigment Exhibiting Ammonia Gas Capture beyond Standard
   Adsorbents with Adsorption Sites of Two Kinds
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Prussian blue is a historical pigment synthesized for the first time at the beginning of 18th century. Here we demonstrate that the historical pigment exhibits surprising adsorption properties of gaseous ammonia. Prussian blue shows 12.5 mmol/g of ammonia capacity at 0.1 MPa, whereas standard ammonia adsorbents show only 5.08-11.3 mmol/g. Dense adsorption was also observed for trace contamination in atmosphere. Results also show higher adsorption by Prussian blue analogues with the optimization of chemical composition. The respective capacities of cobalt hexacyanocobaltate (CoHCC) and copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) were raised to 21.9 and 20.2 mmol/g, the highest value among the recyclable adsorbents. Also, CoHCC showed repeated adsorption in vacuum. CuHCF showed regeneration by acid washing. The chemical state of the adsorbed ammonia depends on the presence of the water in atmosphere: NH3, which was stored as in the dehydrated case, was converted into NH4+ in the hydrated case.

TI The synthesis of cubic Fe2O3<middle
   dot>TiO2 material and its application in heterogeneous
   photo-Fenton degradation of dyes under visible light
SO JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH
AB In the present study, the synthesis of metal organic framework (MOF) template-derived materials is reported. Cubic Fe2O3<middle dot>TiO2 material was synthesized by using Prussian blue as the sacrificed template and aqueous soluble TiOSO4 as a TiO2 precursor. The obtained material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. The characterization confirmed the existence of cubic alpha-Fe2O3 core and anatase TiO2 shell in the composite. Furthermore, the appearance of TiO2 shell has significantly enhanced the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area yet still retained small bandgap energy of around 2.0 eV. This material was employed to degrade chosen organic dyes, including cationic dyes and anionic dye, in a heterogeneous photo-Fenton like system. The experimental results showed that this material exhibited higher adsorption and degradation capacity toward cationic dyes than anionic dye. The fitting of experimental data into two kinetic models revealed that the removal of the dyes can be better described by Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The recyclability of the catalyst was also examined.

TI A high-selective and stable melamine form with economic and simple
   decoration for purification of thallium (I)-contaminated water
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB In natural freshwater and wastewater environments, thallium (Tl) is an infrequent yet exceptionally toxic heavy metal, presenting a formidable peril to human health. The arsenal of substances accessible for Tl(I) adsorption encompasses biochar, activated carbon, metal oxides, and diverse materials. The adsorption capabilities of activated carbon and biochar are limited, while metal oxide materials are expensive and challenging to regenerate. Developing cost-effective materials with high selectivity for Tl(I) removal poses an ongoing challenge in material technology. In this investigation, a novel composite denoted as PB@PDA/PEI-MF has been successfully synthesized, comprising Melamine Foam (MF) co-supported with Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) via the incorporation of polydopamine (PDA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI). The PB@PDA/PEI-MF material demonstrates remarkable efficacy in the efficient sequestration of Tl(I) across a broad pH spectrum, ranging from 6 to 10. Moreover, even in the incidence of various coexisting metal ions (e.g., Na+, K+, or Ca2+), the Tl(I) removal rate by PB@PDA/PEIMF remains consistently high, exceeding or equal to 90%. Its high selectivity, anti-ion interference ability, and ease of recycling address the most prominent shortcomings of previous materials. Leveraging these advantages, the PB@PDA/PEI-MF material demonstrates exceptional proficiency in the remediation of real-world Tl(I)-contaminated Pearl River water, aligning with the stringent industrial wastewater standards. The conclusive outcomes affirm that PB@PDA/PEIMF presents a viable technological solution for the effective removal of Tl(I) in intricate environmental contexts.

   Reaction
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The construction of highly active and durable non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an ongoing challenge. Here, we report the development of a hybrid nanostructure of PBA cubes wrapped with mixed W-Co oxysulfides in a hair-like structure through sulfurization of polyoxometalate ((CoW12)-W-III POM) as a bimetallic precursor. These unique heterostructures of PBA@Co-W-O-S grafted on carbon cloth afford abundant active sites and improved charge transfer kinetics that synergistically enhance the OER activity (overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). The synthetic approach used in this report can be extended for developing inexpensive, durable and efficient catalysts with diverse structures.

TI Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Performance of a CdS-Based Photocatalyst: In
   Situ Transition from Type I to Type II Heterojunction during
   Photocatalysis
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB The heterojunction in photocatalysis establishes an internal electric field between the semiconductors, which is one of the effective methods for enhancing the separation of photo-generated carriers of semiconductors. Herein, a strategy is rationally proposed, which is performed in situ to transform the hybrid photocatalyst composed of the Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) and CdS (CP) into another more active hybrid photocatalyst consisting of NiS and CdS (CN) during photo-catalysis in the sulfur sacrificial reagent. The coupled component on the n-type CdS is converted from an n-type Ni-Co PBA to another p-type NiS during the process, thus constructing a p-n heterojunction and achieving a good photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Moreover, the carrier transfer mechanism is also an in situ transition from type I in CP to type II in CN during the HER process, which is supported by surface photovoltage and transient absorption spectroscopy. The CP-2 photocatalyst in the sulfur sacrificial reagent has a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution amount of 176.6 mu mol, which is 13.9 times higher than that of pure CdS. Overall, this work develops an in situ carrier transfer mechanism conversion strategy for expanding the HER photocatalysts and enhancing their photocatalytic HER performance.

TI Direct Observation of Short-Range Structural Coherence During a Charge
   Transfer Induced Spin Transition in a CoFe Prussian Blue Analogue by
   Transmission Electron Microscopy
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The local structure within the CoFe atomic array of the photoswitchable coordination polymer magnet, K0.3Co[Fe(CN)(6)](0.77)center dot nH(2)O, is directly observed during charge transfer induced spin transition (CTIST), a solidsolid phase change, using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Along with the low-spin (LS) or thermally quenched high-spin (HS) states normally observed in CTIST solids at low temperature, slow cooling of K0.3Co[Fe(CN)(6)](0.77)center dot nH(2)O results in an intermediate phase containing both HS and LS domains with short coherence length. By mapping individual metalmetal distances, the nanometer-scale HS domains are directly visualized within the LS array. Temperature-dependent analyses allow monitoring of HS domain coarsening along the warming branch of the CTIST, providing direct visualization of the elastic process and insight into the mechanism of phase propagation. Normally sensitive to electron beam damage, the low-temperature TEM measurements of the porous coordination polymer are enabled by using appropriate ionic liquids instead of usual conductive thin-film coatings, an approach that should find general utility in related classes of materials.

TI Ultrathin Cobalt-Based Prussian Blue Analogue Nanosheet-Assembled
   Nanoboxes Interpenetrated with Carbon Nanotubes as a Fast
   Electron/Potassium-Ion Conductor for Superior Potassium Storage
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Rechargeable potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are regarded as potential substitutes for industrial lithium-ion batteries in large scale energy storage systems due to the world's abundant potassium supplies. Althogh cobalt hexacyanocobaltate (CoHCC) exhibits broad potential as a PIB anode material, its performance is currently unsatisfactory. Herein, novel 5 nm scale ultrathin CoHCC nanosheet-assembled nanoboxes with interspersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs/CoHCC nanoboxes) are fabricated to realize a highly reactive PIB anode. The ultrathin CoHCC layers substantially accelerate electron conduction and provide numerous active sites, while the connected CNTs provide fast axial electron transport. Consequently, the optimized anode exhibits a remarkable discharge capacity of 580.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and long-term stability with 71.3% retention over 1000 cycles. In situ and ex situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations are further employed to elucidate the K+ storage process and the reason for the enhanced performance of the CNTs/CoHCC nanoboxes.

TI On the Scope of XPS as Sensor in Coordination Chemistry of Transition
   Metal Hexacyanometallates
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB This study reports an evaluation on the scope of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to obtain information for the coordination chemistry of transition metal (T-n) hexacyanometallates, T(x)A(z)[M-m(CN)(6)](y) where nx +z = y(6 - m), A is an alkaline charge-compensating cation, and M-m is a transition metal with a maximum of 6 electrons in its nd orbitals. XPS provides an elegant picture on the role of the CN -back bonding effect to determine the charge density on the N atom and, from this fact, on its coordination to transition metal ions to form coordination polymers. XPS appears to be able to discriminate between octahedral and tetrahedral coordination for the outer metal (T) to the N end of CN ligands, particularly when the XPS peak and the Auger lines are combined. A similar performance was observed when this spectroscopic technique is used to identify when the CN ligand is found with linear and bifurcated coordination mode to the metal linked at its N end. These last two structural features are relevant in the coordination of metal hexacyanometallates and determine their physical and functional properties. The results obtained from XPS data were correlated with the a priori information from IR spectra and the reported crystal structures for all the samples under study.

TI Structure and adsorption properties of a porous cooper hexacyanoferrate
   polymorph
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS
AB The key questions addressed here were: the structure elucidation and the investigation of the adsorption space and framework expansion effect of a Cu(II) hexacyanoferrate (III) polymorph (labeled Cu-PBA-I). The structural analysis was performed with a broad set of characterization methods. Additionally, a low and high pressure carbon dioxide adsorption investigation was performed, assuming, to comprehend the adsorption experiments, that the adsorbent plus the adsorbed phase were a solid solution. We concluded: that the Cu-PBA-I presented the following composition, K1/4Cu(II)[Fe(III)(CN)(6)](3/4)circle(1/4)nH(2)O, exhibited an antiferromagnetic behavior and displayed a thermally stable I4m2 space group lattice in the degassed state. Moreover, the low pressure adsorption study allowed the calculation of the micropore volume, W=0.09 cm(3)/g and the isosteric heat of adsorption, q(iso)=19 kJ/mol; further, the high pressure adsorption data revealed an extremely high adsorption capacity owing to a framework expansion effect. Finally, the DRIFTS spectrum of adsorbed CO2 displayed peaks corresponding to carbon dioxide physically adsorbed and interacting with electron accepting Lewis acid sites. Hence, was produced an excellent adsorbent which combine porosity and anti-ferromagnetism, antagonist properties rarely found together. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with fast-charge capability and long lifespan could be applied in various sustainable energy storage systems, from personal devices to grid storage. Inspired by the disordered Rubik's cube, here, we report that the high-entropy (HE) concept can lead to a very substantial improvement in the sodium storage properties of hexacyanoferrate (HCF). An example of HE-HCF has been synthesized as a proof of concept, which has achieved impressive cycling stability over 50 000 cycles and an outstanding fast-charging capability up to 75 C. Remarkable air stability and all-climate performance are observed. Its quasi-zero-strain reaction mechanism and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been measured and analyzed by multiple in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations. This strategy provides new insights into the development of advanced electrodes and provides the opportunity to tune electrochemical performance by tailoring the atomic composition.

   nickel hexamyanocobaltate for high-performance asymmetric hybrid
   supercapacitor
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, a mild chemical precipitation method and simple hydrothermal treatment of the nickel hexamyanocobaltate precursor strategy are developed to prepare a sea urchin-like CoNi2S4 compound with remarkable specific capacity and excellent cycling stability. The prepared CoNi2S4 has an outstanding specific capacity of 149.1 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and an initial capacity of 83.1% after 3000 cycles at 10 A g(-1). Moreover, the porous carbon nanospheres (PCNs) with exhibit cycling stability (94.7% of initial specific capacity after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g(-1)) are selected as negative electrode to match CoNi2S4 positive electrode for assembly of CoNi2S4//PCNs asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). Satisfactorily, the as-assembled CoNi2S4//PCNs ASC exhibits an impressive energy density of 41.6 Wh kg(-1) at 797 W kg(-1), as well as the suitable capacity retention of 82.8% after 10 000 cycles. The superior properties of the device demonstrated that the as-prepared material is potential energy storage material.

TI Highly Efficient Solar-Light-Driven Photodegradation of Metronidazole by
   Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Nanocubes Showing Enhanced Catalytic
   Performances
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Environmental pollution is a complex problem that threatens the health and life of animal and plant ecosystems on the planet. In this respect, the scientific community faces increasingly challenging tasks in designing novel materials with beneficial properties to address this issue. This study describes a simple yet effective synthetic protocol to obtain nickel hexacyanoferrate (Ni-HCF) nanocubes as a suitable photocatalyst, which can enable an efficient photodegradation of hazardous anthropogenic organic contaminants in water, such as antibiotics. Ni-HCF nanocubes are fully characterized and their optical and electrochemical properties are investigated. Preliminary tests are also carried out to photocatalytically remove metronidazole (MDZ), an antibiotic that is difficult to degrade and has become a common contaminant as it is widely used to treat infections caused by anaerobic microorganisms. Under simulated solar light, Ni-HCF displays substantial photocatalytic activity, degrading 94.3% of MDZ in 6 h. The remarkable performance of Ni-HCF nanocubes is attributeto a higher ability to separate charge carriers and to a lower resistance toward charge transfer, as confirmed by the electrochemical characterization. These achievements highlight the possibility of combining the performance of earth-abundant catalysts with a renewable energy source for environmental remediation, thus meeting the requirements for sustainable development.
   Water pollution is a threat to health and ecosystems. Nickel-hexacyanoferrate (Ni-HCF) nanocubes provide a step forward in addressing such issue, as they show excellent photocatalytic activity toward degradation of up to approximate to 94% of the antibiotic metronidazole under simulated solar light in 6 h. Superior charge carrier separation and low resistance make Ni-HCF promising for sustainable and effective environmental remediation. image

TI A High-Voltage and Cycle Stable Aqueous Rechargeable Na-Ion Battery
   Based on Na2Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2
   NaTi2(PO4)3 Intercalation Chemistry
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Aqueous rechargeable Na-ion batteries (ARNBs) hold great promise for grid-scale electric energy storage because of their outstanding merits of low cost and resource abundance; however, their low energy density and poor cycling stability limit practical application. In this work, we reported a Prussian Blue (PB) analogue Na-2,Zn-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) as a high-voltage aqueous cathode for ARNBs and achieved its stable cycling at a high operation potential of 1.13 V (vs SHE) by using of a highly concentrated NaClO4 electrolyte. Raman spectroscopy, in situ XRD, and DFT calculations have been utilized to study the underlying mechanism of electrode performance as a function of electrolyte concentration. It was revealed that in the concentrated 17 m NaClO4 electrolyte almost all the water molecules are coordinated with Na+ ions, and the solvation energy of PB materials increases considerably with increasing salt concentrations, which broadens the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte and greatly alleviates the dissolution of the materials. An aqueous rechargeable Na-ion battery was constructed by using a Na2Zn3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) cathode, a NaTi2(PO4)(3) anode, and 17 m NaClO4 electrolyte. This full cell demonstrates a high-voltage output of 1.6 V and an energy density of 55 Wh kg(-1) (based on the total mass of the electrode-active materials), offering a viable alternative to commercial aqueous batteries for large-scale EES applications.

TI A 4 V Class Potassium Metal Battery with Extremely Low Overpotential
SO ACS NANO
AB K metal anodes usually have a low Coulombic efficiency and poor safety owing to their large volume variation and high chemical reactivity. In this study, a three-dimensional K (3D-K) anode is formed by plating metallic K into hollow N-doped C polyhedrons/ graphene (HNCP/G). Then a Sn-based solid electrolyte interphase layer is conformably coated onto the surface of 3D-K to construct Snp3D-K. Compared with the typical K-foil anode, the Sn@3D-K anode can significantly reduce the interfacial resistance, improve the 1C+ ion transport mobility, reduce parasitic reactions, and suppress the formation of K dendrites. Meanwhile, HNCP/G serves as a chemically stable, conductive host to accommodate the volume expansion/shrinkage of Sn@3D-K. Owing to these merits, the symmetric Sn@3D-K cell exhibits low voltage hysteresis (9 mV at 0.2 mA cm(-2) after 500 h; 31 mV at 1 mA cm(-2) after 100 h). When paired with a Prussian blue (PB)/graphene cathode, the K1.56Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](1.08)/G parallel to Sn@3D-K battery delivers an average discharge plateau of 4.02 V, an ultralow overpotential of 0.01 V, and a high specific capacity of 147.2 mAh g(-1), approaching the theoretical value of K2MnFe(CN)(6) (156 mAh g(-1)). A 4 V class K metal battery that exhibits extremely low overpotential and high specific capacity, which are the best among previously reported PB-based K batteries, is proposed.

TI Effect of Particle Size and Anion Vacancy on Electrochemical Potassium
   Ion Insertion into Potassium Manganese Hexacyanoferrates
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMnHCF) can be used as a positive electrode for potassium-ion batteries because of its high energy density. The effect of particle size and [Fe(CN)(6)](n-) vacancies on the electrochemical potassium insertion of KMnHCFs was examined through experimental data and theoretical calculations. When nearly stoichiometric KMnHCF was synthesized and tested, smaller particle sizes were found to be important for achieving superior electrochemical performance in terms of capacity and rate capability. However, even in the case of larger particles, introducing a suitable number of anion vacancies enabled KMnHCF to exhibit comparable electrode performance. Electrochemical tests and density functional theory calculations indicated that anion vacancies contribute to the enhancement of K+ ion diffusion, which realizes good electrochemical performance. Structural design, including crystal vacancies and particle size, is the key to their high performance as a positive electrode.

TI Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to
   2,5-furandicarboxylic acid with Fe-Ni3S2@NiFe-PBA nanocubes
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) represents a promising avenue for generating value-added products derived from biomass. Nevertheless, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for HMF electrooxidation (HMFOR) remains an ongoing challenge. In this study, we present a novel approach wherein Fe-doped Ni3S2@NiFe-PBA nanocubes are synthesized directly on threedimensional nickel foam (NF) substrates using a straightforward hydrothermal reaction and subsequent impregnation. This composite Fe-Ni3S2@NiFe-PBA/NF catalyst showcases exceptional performance in HMFOR (a faraday efficiency of 97.4 %), characterized by both its remarkable conversion (100 %) and impressive FDCA yield (97.1 %), coupled with its robust stability over ten cycles. The heightened HMFOR activity exhibited by the Fe-Ni3S2@NiFe-PBA/NF catalyst can be contributed to the introduction of Fe into the Ni3S2 matrix. This deliberate doping strategy engenders accelerated charge transfer kinetics, an increased abundance of accessible surface-active sites, and improved conductivity, thereby enhancing the overall HMFOR performance. By establishing these outcomes, this investigation lays a foundation for the prospective design of electrocatalysts with applications in biomass utilization and energy conversion.

TI Coordination engineering for iron-based hexacyanoferrate as a
   high-stability cathode for sodium-ion batteries
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Iron- based hexacyanoferrate (Fe-HCF) are promising cathode materials for sodium- ion batteries (SIBs) due to their unique open- channel structure that facilitates fast ion transport and framework stability. However, practical implementation of SIBs has been hindered by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), poor rate performance, and short lifespan. Herein, we report a coordination engineering to synthesize sodium- rich Fe-HCF as cathodes for SIBs through a uniquely designed 10- kg- scale chemical reactor. Our study systematically investigated the relationship between coordination surroundings and the electrochemical behavior. Building on this understanding, the cathode delivered a reversible capacity of 99.3 mAh g -1 at 5 C (1 C = 100 mA g-1), exceptional rate capability (51 mAh g -1 even at 100 C), long lifespan (over 15,000 times at 50 C), and a high ICE of 92.7%. A full cell comprising the Fe-HCF cathode and hard carbon (HC) anode exhibited an impressive cyclic stability with a high- capacity retention rate of 98.3% over 1,000 cycles. Meanwhile, this material can be readily scaled to the practical levels of yield. The findings underscore the potential of Fe-HCF as cathodes for SIBs and highlight the significance of controlling nucleation and morphology through coordination engineering for a sustainable energy storage system.

TI Potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate/graphene as a high-performance
   cathode for potassium-ion batteries
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Although Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) show promising applications as cathodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), it remains a challenge to synthesize high-performance PBAs enabling fast/reversible K-ion diffusion. Herein, we report the synthesis of a high-performance potassium manganese Prussian blue/graphene (KPB/G) nanocomposite obtained via a facile ball-milling method. It was found that after ball milling with graphene, the KPB particles were broken into small grains that were homogeneously loaded onto the few-layered graphene. The nanocomposite demonstrates a high initial discharge capacity (131.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C), a high average working potential (similar to 4 V at 0.1C), superior rate capability (108.8 mA h g(-1) at 5C and 100.2 mA h g(-1) at 10C) and long cycle life (96.9% after 120 cycles at 0.5C, 89.3% after 500 cycles at 5C, and 82.4% after 300 cycles at 10C). The excellent electrochemical performance of KPB/G is due to the small size of KPB and the conductive and protective effects of graphene. This work provides a facile method to synthesize Mn-based Prussian blue for high-performance potassium-ion batteries.

TI Removal of surface cesium ion contamination by peelable composite
   coating with a highly effective magnetic adsorbent
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Conventional methods used during nuclear facility decommissioning to remove radioactive contamination from equipment surfaces produced a lot of trash and could result in secondary contamination. Peelable coatings, on the other hand, have been frequently employed for surface decontamination because of their great efficacy, peelability, flexibility, and compatibility with various substrates. Herein, we developed a novel efficient magnetic cesium ion adsorbent (Qmax = 249 mg/g) and combined it with polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to design a peelable composite coating. The composite coating can be used to decontaminate a variety of surfaces, including aluminum, plexiglas, marble, and stainless steel, with a combined decontamination efficiency of more than 95%, especially when applied to stainless steel surfaces with a decontamination rate of 98.69%. The coating also possesses excellent mechanical properties and recyclability, allowing easy recovery of the film-forming material and magnetic adsorbent recovery at the end of the decontamination process.

AB We report on the existence of cluster spin-glass behavior and magnetocaloric properties of potassium-ion -intercalated copper hexacyanoferrate open framework material K2x /3Cu[Fe(CN)6]2/3 & BULL; nH2O (x = 0 and 0.3) synthesized using a coprecipitate method. The structural properties are investigated using room-temperature powder x-ray and neutron diffraction measurements. The results derived from the fitted x-ray and neutron diffrac-tion data using the Rietveld refinement method reveal that both compounds are in pure single-nanocrystalline phase with face-centered cubic crystal structure of space group Fm-3m. The room-temperature Mossbauer spectroscopy reveals the presence of a low-spin (LS) state of FeIII for compound x = 0, whereas for compound x = 0.3, LS states of FeII and FeIII are evident. The chemical and Mossbauer studies reveal stoichiometries of compounds as CuII[FeIII(CN)6]2/3 & BULL; 3.75 H2O (x = 0) compound (1) and K0.2CuII[FeII 0.3FeIII 0.7(CN)6]2/3 & BULL; H2O (x = 0.3). The dc magnetization measurement shows a magnetic phase transition from a paramagnetic to a ferromagneticlike state below the magnetic ordering temperatures of & SIM;18.6 and & SIM;16.3 K for the compounds (1) and (2), respectively. The positive value of Curie constants obtained from the fitting of the Curie-Weiss law in the paramagnetic region confirms the presence of ferromagnetic interaction in both compounds. The spin-only effec-tive paramagnetic moments are found to be & SIM;2.3 and & SIM;1.9 & mu;B/f.u. for compounds (1), and (2), respectively. The analysis of ac susceptibility measurements as a function of frequency shows that the spin dynamics follows the Vogel-Fulcher and the power law. The best fitted values of & tau;o = 4.037 x 10-7 s and 3.5 x 10-6 s for compounds (1) and (2), respectively, confirm a cluster spin-glass behavior of both compounds. A neutron depolarization study further validates the cluster spin-glass nature of both compounds. The magnetocaloric effect for both the compounds is further investigated and found to be higher for compound (1) than compound (2). The maximum magnetic entropy change-SM under a magnetic field of 50 kOe is found to be & SIM;6.61 and 2.95 J kg-1 K-1 for compounds (1) and (2), respectively. The relative cooling power is found to be 78.3 J kg-1 for compound (1) and 40 J kg-1 for compound (2).

TI Vacancy and Composition Engineering of Manganese Hexacyanoferrate for
   Sodium-Ion Storage
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) with an open framework is suitable for accommodating sodium ions. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay caused by the large structural deformation resulting advantage of the strong chelation between EDTA and Mn ions, a strategy employing Mn vacancies (VMn) in combination with the introduction of Ni is proposed to suppress the J-T distortion of MnHCF. A Ni-doped MnHCF with VMn and a low crystal water content (K1.95Na0.05Ni0.02Mn0.93[Fe(CN)6] ???0.05middot0.41H2O) is prepared, which delivered an improved capacity retention of 80% at 0.5C after 100 cycles. This work provides a combined vacancy and composition engineering strategy for effective suppression of J-T distortion in the MnHCF framework toward high-performance sodium-ion batteries.

TI Tungsten-doped cobalt-iron bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles for
   enhanced oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Background: Hydrogen obtained from electrochemical water splitting is an efficient method for hydrogen production, which is urgent to develop high efficiency electrocatalyst and commercialize the process. Methods: In our work, we used coprecipitation, doping and phosphating strategies to report the trimetallic Prussian blue analogue precursors (W-CoFe PBA) were prepared by doping sodium tungstate into cobalt-ironPrussian blue analogues (CoFe PBA), and then by a low temperature phosphating treatment to obtain tungsten doped cobalt-iron phosphide (W-CoP/FeP) heterostructures. This strategy of doping and then phosphating can allow the charge distribution is adjusted, the conductivity is increased, the electron transport to the surface is accelerated, and the synergistic effect between CoP and FeP is enhanced. Significant findings: The experimental results show that the mass ratio of tungsten source to CoFe-PBA is 0.5 (0.5W-CoP/FeP), which shows outstanding activity with overpotentials of 282 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 29.14 mV dec-1. Simultaneously, it also exhibits excellent stability for 24 h in the chronopotentiometry test. This work provides a simple improvement for the application of Prussian blue analogues in the electrochemical water splitting.

TI Manganese hexacyanoferrate reinforced by PEDOT coating towards high-rate
   and long-life sodium-ion battery cathode
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogues hold great promise as cathodes in sodium ion batteries. Among Prussian blue analogues, manganese hexacyanoferrate is desirable because of its high working voltage, as well as its high specific capacity and low cost. However, poor cycling stability and unsatisfactory rate capability of manganese hexacyanoferrate, which are mainly caused by poor intrinsic conductivity, phase transition, side reactions, and transition metal dissolution, extremely limit its practical application. In this work, we demonstrate a high-rate and long-life MnHCF@PEDOT sodium ion battery cathode through a facile in situ polymerization method. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of the inhibited Mn/Fe dissolution, suppressed phase transition, and improved capacitive storage, the composite electrode exhibits a high capacity of 147.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, 95.2 mA h g(-1) at a high rate of 10C, and 78.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, even at a low temperature of -10 degrees C, MnHCF@PEDOT still delivers a high capacity of 87.0 mA h g(-1) and maintains 71.5 mA h g(-1) (82.2%) after 500 cycles.

TI Electrochemical synthesis of Co-, Ni- and NiCo-based hexacyanocobaltates
   as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation studies
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB The performance of electrocatalysts for the oxidation of water is a crucial factor in the advancement of future technologies for energy conversion such as nonsegregated solar water-splitting systems and water electrolyzers. Previous research demonstrates indisputably that PBAs' catalytic activity can vary significantly depending on their altered structural makeup and fabrication techniques. In the current study electrodeposition, a binder-free perspective has been applied to synthesize Co-, Ni-, and a rare example of trimetallic NiCo-hexacyanocobaltates as electrocatalysts on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. The synthesized materials have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spec-troscopy (XPS). The water oxidation activity of synthesized materials has been examined in 1 M KOH by measuring their overpotential, Tafel slope, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), and charge transfer resistance (Rct) values. Results have shown that trimetallic NiCo-hexacyanocobaltate exhibited good electro-catalytic activity for water oxidation reaction with an overpotential of 331 mV versus RHE at 10 mA cm-2 current density, 48 mV/dec Tafel slope, and 75 cm2 ECSA.

TI Degradation of sunscreen agent 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid
   using monopersulfate activated by MOF-derived cobalt sulfide nanoplates
SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB As 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid (PBSA) represents most-extensively used UV absorber, release of PBSA into the aquatic environment has posed huge risks to the ecology because PBSA is an endocrine disruptor and highly soluble in water. For developing effective approaches to eliminate PBSA from water, this study develops cobalt sulfide for the first time as a heterogeneous catalyst to activate monopersulfate (MP) for producing sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) to degrade PBSA. In particular, a cubic bundle of cobalt sulfide nanoplates (CoSNP) is created from a convenient sulfurization of cobaltic metal organic framework (CoMOF) to convert this CoMOF to CoSNP. This resultant CoSNP can show much higher catalytic activities than the pristine CoMOF, and the reference catalyst, Co3O4 nanoparticle, for activating MP to degrade PBSA. With very low dosages of CoSNP = 25 mg/L and MP = 100 mg/L, 5 mg/L of PBSA can be completely removed in 45 min, proving that CoSNP is a promising catalyst for activating MP to PBSA. The activation mechanism and degradation pathway of PBSA degradation by CoSNP + MP is investigated here by electron paramagnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry to offer useful insights into degradation behaviors for developing sulfate-radical-based processes of PBSA degradation using cobalt sulfide catalysts.

SO CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN CHINESE UNIVERSITIES
AB In this study, we report that Berlin Green (FeFe-BG) framework exhibits superior performance in the catalytic coupling of carbon disulfide (CS2) and propylene oxide (PO) to generate a random copolymer containing thioether, propylene monothiocarbonate and ether units. Oxygen and sulfur atom exchange was detected in polymeric and cyclic thiocarbonate byproducts and utilized to modulate the copolymerization of CS2 and propylene oxide. The coupling of PO and CS2 was selective for copolymer formation under various reaction conditions. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy determined two distinct polymer linkages and two cyclic byproducts. Copolymer number average molecular weights ranged from 6.4 kg/mol to 10.5 kg/mol, with a comparatively low polydispersity of 1.3-1.7. The CS2/PO molar feed ratio had a significant impact on the O/S exchange process; the ratio of cyclic thiocarbonate byproducts could be efficiently regulated by tuning the CS2 molar feed ratio.

TI Rapid synthesis of sodium-rich Prussian white for Sodium-ion battery via
   a bottom-up approach
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this work, combining homogeneous rapid precipitation in microreactor and following thermal aging treatment, we proposed a bottom-up approach to afford rapid and productive preparation of NaxMn[Fe(CN)(6)](y) with the low defect and high sodium content. It was revealed that the key to a successful bottom-up synthesis was to enhance the aggregation-mediated growth of building blocks. Homogeneous rapid precipitation in microreactor decouples the nucleation and growth under high supersaturation and thus overwhelmingly obtain uniform building blocks. Thus, the Ostwald ripening growth is seriously weakened due to narrow size distribution and these building blocks are more prone to fusion growth due to similar crystal properties and lower aggregation barrier. The as-prepared MnHCF with high crystallinity delivers a high capacity (162.4 mAhg(-1) at 15 mAg-1), an excellent rate performance (144.8 mAhg(-1) at 150 mAg(-1), 109.2 mAhg(-1) at 750 mAg(-1)) and satisfied cyclic retention (with a capacity retention of 76% for 100 cycles at the current density of 150 mAg(-1)).

TI Ultrafast Aqueous Potassium-Ion Batteries Cathode for Stable
   Intermittent Grid-Scale Energy Storage
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The inherent short-term transience of solar and wind sources cause significant challenges for the electricity grid. Energy storage systems that can simultaneously provide high power, long cycle life, and high energy efficiency are required to accommodate the fast-changing output fluctuations. Here, an ultrafast aqueous K-ion battery based on the potassium-rich mesoporous nickel ferrocyanide (II) (K2NiFe(CN)(6)center dot 1.2H(2)O) is developed. This battery achieves an unprecedented rate capability up to 500 C (8214 W kg(-1)), which only takes 4.1 s for one charge or discharge. The open-framework structure of K2NiFe(CN)(6)center dot 1.2H(2)O with small volume variation supports the capacity retention of 98.6% after 5000 cycles, and a superior round-trip energy efficiency of 95.6% at a 5 C rate. Beyond monovalent ion storage, K2NiFe(CN)(6)center dot 1.2H(2)O can also function as a versatile high-rate cathode for divalent-ion batteries (Mg2+), trivalent-ion batteries (Al3+), and hybrid full-cells applications. These properties represent a significant step forward in the exploitation of ultrafast metal ions storage, and accelerate the development of intermittent grid-scale energy storage technologies.

AB Selective ion separation via capacitive deionization (CDI) is of relevance because of its environmental and in-dustrial applications in water purification and softening, heavy metal removal, and resource recovery. Conventionally, carbon electrodes and ion-selective membranes have been used for selective removal of anions and cations. In this study, we engineered a CDI cell with two identical NiHCF electrodes, separated by an anion-exchange membrane coated with a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM), for simultaneous and selective separation of monovalent over divalent anions and cations. The modified membrane rejects divalent over monovalent anions while the NiHCF electrodes selectively adsorb monovalent over divalent ions. A separation factor (beta) of 7 < beta < 14 was obtained for Cl- over SO42-, while an average beta of & AP; 17 was obtained for Na+ over Mg2+, reflecting the preference of the modified membrane and the electrodes, respectively. Moreover, this preference was preserved at low concentrations of monovalent ions as well. This tandem use of intercalation electrodes and a PEM membrane provides a new and facile method for simultaneous cation and anion selectivity in CDI, opening new avenues for enhanced and tunable separations from complex ion mixtures

TI Fe-substituted Mn-based Prussian white as cathode for high-performance
   potassium-ion battery
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Prussian white (PW) has a stable three-dimensional frame structure and large ion migration channels, which has been widely studied as the cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries (PIB) in recent years. The multi-composition in PWs has a great impact on the electrochemical performance as cathode materials. In this work, we investigated the relationship between Fe substitution content and electrochemical properties. The sample of PW with 10%Fe substitution shows the overall optimum electrochemical performance, which delivers a high reversible capacity of 124.3 mAh g(-1) and capacity retention of 70.0% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g(-1), as well as 77.5 mAh g(-1) at a large current density of 500 mA g(-1). Actually, partial Fe substitution could effectively stabilize the lattice structure and improve electrochemical properties. This work provides a practical strategy to synthesize PWs with stable crystal structure and preferable performance, which could serve as a reference for the electrochemical improvement of electrode materials.

TI Theoretical evaluation of electrochemical cell architectures using
   cation intercalation electrodes for desalination
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Water scarcity is a dilemma facing much of the global population. Cation intercalation desalination (CID) cells, which use intercalation host compounds (IHCs) in combination with ion-exchange Membranes (IEMs), could aid in addressing this challenge by treating saline water sources. Originally, the performance of such cells was predicted utilizing continuous flow of saline water through porous IHC electrodes. Here, we use two-dimensional porous-electrode theory with concentrated solution transport to evaluate the performance of various cell architectures where flow occurs through open flow channels (OFCs) when two IHC electrodes comprised of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) are used to store Na* ions. We show that, when two OFCs are used, cation exchange membranes (CEMs) are adjoined at flowchannel/electrode interfaces, and an anion exchange membrane (AEM) is arranged between flow channels, salt removal increases relative to the original design with flow -through (FT) electrodes. The IEM stacking sequence within such a membrane flow -by (MFB) cell is the fundamental repeat unit for electrodialysis (ED) stacks using many IEMs (CEM/AEM/ /CEM/AEM/CEM) with Many diluate streams. Accordingly, we simulate the performance of such ED stacks rising NiHCF IHCs, and we predict that salt adsorption capacity (per unit NiHCF mass) is amplified by twenty -fold relative to MFB and FT cells, while simultaneously decreasing 0.7 M NaCI feed water to 0.2-0.3 M within diluate streams. The generality of these findings is further supported by simulations using Na0.44MnO2 IHC instead of NiHCF. Thus, we propose the use of cation IHCs as alternatives to the gas -evolution reactions used in conventional ED. (C)2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Aging Mechanism of Mn-Based Prussian Blue Cathode Material by
   Synchrotron 2D X-ray Fluorescence
SO BATTERIES-BASEL
AB The aging mechanism of 10% and 30% nickel-substituted manganese hexacyanoferrate cathode material in aqueous zinc-ion batteries has been explored through the advanced synchrotron-based two-dimensional X-ray fluorescence technique. Thanks to the two-dimension modality, not only were the metal concentration dynamics throughout the entire electrodes followed during the aging process, but their spatial distribution was also revealed, suggesting the route of the material transformation. The dissolution of Mn and Ni, as well as the penetration of Zn inside the framework were detected, while the Mn aggregations were found outside the hexacyanoferrate framework. Additionally, the possibility of conducting X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on the regions of interest made it possible to explore the chemical state of each metal, and furthermore, synchrotron-based powder X-ray diffraction demonstrated the gradual structural modification in 30% Ni-containing sample series in terms of the different phase formation.

TI The Effect of the Surrounding Matrix on Spin Transition Nanoparticles:
   How Shell Characteristics Alter Core Elastic Properties in Core-Shell
   Particles
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB A surrounding matrix is known to alter nanoparticle spin transitions, the solid state structural phase changes associated with transitions between high spin (HS) and low spin(LS) states. To better quantify how the spin transition solid and surrounding matrix interact, several series of core-shell particles were prepared based on RbxCo[Fe(CN)6]z & sdot; nH2O, RbCoFe-PBA, as spin transition core with isostructural shells of different compositions and thicknesses. Synchrotron PXRD through the thermal high HS to LS, the LS to photoexcited high spin (PXHS), and thermal PXHS to LS transitions, show the activation energy is lowered as shells become thicker and stiffer. Calorimetry data coupled with transition state theory analysis indicate the core stiffens in the core-shell particles relative to the uncoated particles. The conclusion is supported by microstrain analysis that shows stiffer shells limit the extent to which the core distorts as individual sites transition, leading to the lower activation energy. Finally, differences in lattice mismatch with different shell materials are shown to alter the mechanism by which the transition progresses.

TI Effect of water molecules on the diffusion of alkali metal ions in CuHCF
   cathodes
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Prussian blue analogues have shown promise as cathode materials competing with sodium ion batteries, while the presence of water molecules severely affects their performance in batteries. Based on density functional theory, the effect of water molecules on the diffusion of alkali ions is revealed by employing CuHCF (copper hexacyanoferrate) as a cathode. The diffusions of alkali ions in CuHCF with or without inserted water molecules are investigated. It was found that Li+/Na+ forms hydrated ions with water molecules in the interstitial voids, while K+ cannot form hydrated ions due to spatial constraints. It would lead to a dramatic increase of diffusion barriers when Li+/Na+ ions carrying water molecules diffuse. The number of inserted water molecules significantly impacts the diffusion of Li+/Na+ ions.

TI Increase in the Magnetic Ordering Temperature (Tc) as
   a Function of the Applied Pressure for
   A2Mn[Mn(CN)6] (A = K, Rb, Cs) Prussian Blue
   Analogues
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Magnetization measurements under pressure reveal that the external hydrostatic pressure significantly increases in the ferrimagnetic transition temperature, T-c, for A(2)Mn[Mn(CN)(6)] (A = K, Rb, Cs). In the case of monoclinic A = K and Rb, dT(c)/dp values are 21.2 and 14.6 K GPa(-1), respectively, and T-c increases by 53 and 39%, respectively, from ambient pressure to 1.0 GPa. The cubic A = Cs compound also shows a monotonous increase with an initial rate of 4.22 K GPa(-1) and about 11.4 K GPa(-1) above 0.6 GPa, and an overall T-c increase by 26% at 1.0 GPa. The increase in T-c is attributed to deformation of the structure such that the Mn-II-N equivalent to C angle decreases with increasing pressure. The smaller the alkali cation, the greater the decrease in the Mn-II-N equivalent to C angle induced by pressure and the larger the increase of dT(c)/dp. This is in accordance with the ambient-pressure structures for A(2)Mn[Mn(CN)(6)] (A = K, Rb, Cs), which have decreasing Mn-II-N equivalent to C angles that correlate to the observed increasing T(c)s as K > Rb > Cs. The large increase in T-c for the A = K compound is the highest class among several cyano-bridged metal complexes. The tuning of the transition temperature by such a weak pressure may lead to additional applications such as switching devices.

Structure model-building and Rietveld refinement of high-resolution synchrotron powder diffraction data revealed a cubic [a=24.0093 angstrom (1), 23.8804 angstrom (2)] 3D extended structural motif with adjacent tetrahedral and octahedral Mn(II)sites in a 3:2 ratio. Each tetrahedral Mn(II)site is surrounded by four low-spin octahedral Mn(II)sites, and each octahedral Mn(II)site is surrounded by six high-spin tetrahedral Mn(II)sites; adjacent sites are antiferromagnetically coupled in 3D. Compensation does not occur, and magnetic ordering as a ferrimagnet is observed atT(c)=13 K for2based on the temperature at which remnant magnetization,M-r(T)-> 0. The hysteresis has an unusual constricted shape with inflection points around 50 and 1.2 kOe with a 5 K coercivity of 16 Oe and remnant magnetization,M-r, of 2050 emuOe mol(-1). The unusual structure and stoichiometry are attributed to the very ionic nature of the high-spin N-bonded Mn(II)ion, which enables the maximization of the attractive van der Waals interactions through minimization of void space via a reduced angle MnNC. This results in an additional example of the A(x)Mn(y)(II)(CN)(x+2y)(x=0,y=1;x=1,y=3;x=2,y=1;x=2,y=2;x=2,y=3;x=3,y=5; andx=4,y=1) family of compounds possessing an unprecedented stoichiometry and lattice motif that are cation adaptive structured materials.

TI New Insight into the Mechanism of Simultaneous Determination of Ascorbic
   Acid, Dopamine, and Uric Acid with Graphene Encapsulated CoFe Alloys
   Electrochemical Sensor
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Herein, a novel electrochemical biosensor is simply constructed by using graphene encapsulated CoFe alloy nanocomposite (CoFe@G) as the electrode modifier for highly sensitive and simultaneous detection of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA). Cyclic voltammetry tests show well-separated peaks for AA at -7 mV, DA at 186 mV, and UA at 325 mV. CoFe@G modifier improves the differentiation of oxidative potential gap between AA and DA, realizing selective detection of these biomolecules. The mechanism of selective detection ability is studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) analysis. It is demonstrated that modifying CoFe@G on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) can effectively lower the oxidation potential of AA other modifiers such as GCE and Au, avoiding potential overlapping with DA and UA and realizing well-resolved signals. QCM reveals that CoFe@G shows great improvement in adsorption of AA, which adsorbs on the graphene out layer in CoFe@G through C-H and C-O chemical bonding indicated by in situ ATR-SEIRAS analysis. It is experimentally demonstrated that both electron transfer and adsorption ability determine the external applied potential to trigger oxidation reaction, but adsorption ability is dominative.

TI Fluorometry detection for trypsin via inner filter effect between
   cytochrome C and in-situ formed fluorescent thiochrome
SO TALANTA
AB A fluorometry assay for trypsin sensitive determination has been presented. The fluorescence of the system at 370/445 nm is derived from thiochrome obtained by in-situ oxidation of thiamine. Based on the inner filter effect, cytochrome C (Cyt C) can quench the fluorescence at 445 nm effectively. Cyt C is specifically hydrolyzed by trypsin through an enzymatic reaction, giving rise to the enhancement of the fluorescence intensity. The change value of fluorescence intensity is proportional to trypsin concentration, which is successfully used for trypsin quantitative detection. This method exhibits good repeatability and selectivity with a detection limit of 0.15 mu g mL(-1) and a quantification limit of 0.50 mu g mL(-1) for trypsin sensing. Moreover, it is applied to detect trypsin in practical serum and urine samples with accurate results. The proposed assay is not only a promising candidate for trypsin determination in practical application but also a potentially valuable tool in urine comprehensive analysis and disease diagnosis.

TI Enabling long-cycling aqueous sodium-ion batteries via Mn dissolution
   inhibition using sodium ferrocyanide electrolyte additive
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Mn-based Prussian blue is an ideal positive electrode material for aqueous sodium-ion batteries but still suffers from Mn dissolution. Here, the authors introduce an Mn-ion trapping agent as an electrolyte additive to produce a 94 Wh kg-1 Na-ion aqueous battery with a long lifespan.
   Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (AIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage due to their safe operational properties and low cost. However, AIBs have low specific energy (i.e., <80 Wh kg(-1)) and limited lifespans (e.g., hundreds of cycles). Mn-Fe Prussian blue analogues are considered ideal positive electrode materials for AIBs, but they show rapid capacity decay due to Jahn-Teller distortions. To circumvent these issues, here, we propose a cation-trapping method that involves the introduction of sodium ferrocyanide (Na4Fe(CN)(6)) as a supporting salt in a highly concentrated NaClO4-based aqueous electrolyte solution to fill the surface Mn vacancies formed in Fe-substituted Prussian blue Na1.58Fe0.07Mn0.97Fe(CN)(6) & BULL; 2.65H(2)O (NaFeMnF) positive electrode materials during cycling. When the engineered aqueous electrolyte solution and the NaFeMnF-based positive electrode are tested in combination with a 3, 4, 9, 10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide-based negative electrode in a coin cell configuration, a specific energy of 94 Wh kg(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) (specific energy based on the active material mass of both electrodes) and a specific discharge capacity retention of 73.4% after 15000 cycles at 2 A g(-1) are achieved.

AB The kinetics for the reaction between potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)(6)) and cobalt chloride (CoCl2) in aqueous solution and water/bis(2-ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccianate (AOT)/isooctane microemulsions were studied by three-wavelength spectrophotometry at 298.2 K. The second-order rate constants (k(2)) were calculated from the time dependence of the concentration of reactant K3Fe(CN)(6). The result showed that the reaction rates in water/AOT/isooctane microemulsions were slower than that in the aqueous solution, and k(2) decreased with molar ratio (omega) of water to AOT in microemulsions, which was interpreted by the transition state theory and confirmed that the reaction took place at the interfaces of the microemulsion water pools.

AB Na-ion batteries have gradually begun to be commercialized due to their advantages of lower cost and wide source of raw materials, but more excellent electrochemical performance is required to compete with lithium-ion batteries. In this work, sodium vanadium hexacyanoferrate (NaVHCF) was designed and synthesized as a Na-ion cathode material to exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. The results show that the capacity retention rate of 1000 cycles at 2.5C rate is 72 %, the Coulombic efficiency is 100 %, and the capacity retention rate of 5000 cycles at 25C high rate is 65 %. After activating at a low current density of 2.5C, it still has a capacity of 42 mAh g(-1) after 2000 cycles at a high rate of 25C, and the capacity retention rate is 92 %. The analysis shows that the excellent rate and long cycling ability are related to the three-dimensional open structure and microporous structure of NaVHCF. During the long cycle, the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions gradually increases and the charge transfer resistance gradually decreases, which improves the battery lifespan. These results suggest that sodium-ion batteries are one step closer to commercial application.

TI Rational engineering of metal-organic coordination networks into
   facet-controlled phosphides for overall water splitting
SO ECOMAT
AB Although transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts display unique electronic structure that serves as functional centers for hydrogen evolution reaction, the synthesis of this class of materials for oxygen evolution remains a challenge due to the complex multielectron transfer pathways and sluggish reaction kinetics. This study details an in-situ modification and transformation of cyanide-bridged nickel-iron (CN-NiFe) organometallic hybrid into the preferential Fe2P phase with prevailing exposed {120(sic)} faceted active centers by leveraging on the facile coordinate cleavage dynamics and compound reactivity of labile metal organic coordination frameworks. The resultant transition metal phosphide attains high electrochemical surface area, low Tafel slope, and low overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction, while also demonstrating bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting. Comprehensive experimental studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that the exceptional catalytic activity originates from the transformation of framework metallic sites into preferential active sites allows an optimal adsorption of oxygen evolution reaction intermediates.

TI Ligand Effects of Penta- and Hexacyanidoferrate-Derived Water Oxidation
   Catalysts on BiVO4 Photoanodes
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The design of an efficient, robust, and cost-competitive photoanode is often considered to be the bottleneck step to an industrial implementation of artificial photosynthesis. To overcome its drawbacks and to improve photoelectrochemical performance, water oxidation co-catalysts can be deposited on the photoanode. Coordination polymers based on Prussian blue, that is, cobalt cyanidoferrates, have emerged as promising water oxidation catalysts because of their low cost and tunable composition, while maintaining high efficiency and stability in a wide range of pH. They present an excellent alternative to typically used metal oxides, which show limited efficiency improvement. Indeed, the hexacyanidoferrate analog KxCoy[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot nH(2)O appears to be an outstanding co-catalyst for decorating bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes, by enabling fast and irreversible hole transfer, combined with high catalytic efficiency. Because intrinsic catalytic activity can be modulated and enhanced by the introduction of pentacyanidoferrate precursors, we compared the effect of different pentacyanidoferrate derivatives on bismuth vanadate photoanodes for light-driven water oxidation. Our results indicate that the coordination polymers prepared using [Fe(CN)(5)(NH3)](3-) as a precursor lead to higher photocurrents and lower onset potential shifts. It is suggested that the relation between catalytic activity and ligand substitution is a combination of electronic effects imposed by the nature of the ligand and morphological effects, which regulate the number of active sites exposed and charge transport across the catalyst layer.

TI Revealing the alkali ions effects in potential shift and Zn dendrites
   suppression via electrolyte concentration regulation in aqueous zinc ion
   batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The energy density of aqueous reachable batteries (ARBs) is limited by the output voltage in the aqueous electrolyte. Herein, low-cost aqueous hybrid electrolytes composed of ZnSO4 and K2SO4 dual salts effectively improve the output voltage and suppress the zinc dendrites. The aqueous full cells assembled with potassium zinc hexacyanoferrate (KZnHCF) cathodes and zinc foil anodes reach an output voltage of 1.92 V and an energy density of 107.6 Wh kg(-1). It is demonstrated the reversible insertion/extraction of K+ at the cathodes and uniform zinc deposition/striping at the anode in hybrid electrolyte via a series in-situ and ex-situ investigation. The dual salt electrolyte can not only satisfy the reversible capacitive dominated process at the cathodes but also suppress the zinc dendrite. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates the K+ preferential intercalation mechanism of KZnHCF in hybrid electrolyte and the inhibition effect of K+ insertion on Zn2+ insertion. This strategy presents a promising approach for development of high performance and low-cost aqueous electrolyte.

TI Printing Air-Stable High-Tc Molecular Magnet with
   Tunable Magnetic Interaction
SO NANO LETTERS
AB High-T-c molecular magnets have amassed much promise; however, the long-standing obstacle for its practical applications is the inaccessibility of high-temperature molecular magnets showing dynamic and nonvolatile magnetization control. In addition, its functional durability is prone to degradation in oxygen and heat. Here, we introduce a rapid prototyping and stabilizing strategy for high T-c (360 K) molecular magnets with precise spatial control in geometry. The printed molecular magnets are thermally stable up to 400 K and air-stable for over 300 days, a significant improvement in its lifetime and durability. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and computational modeling reveal the water ligands controlling magnetic exchange interaction of molecular magnets. The molecular magnets also show dynamical and reversible tunability of magnetic exchange interactions, enabling a colossal working temperature window of 86 K (from 258 to 344 K). This study provides a pathway to flexible, lightweight, and durable molecular magnetic devices through additive manufacturing.

TI Synthesis of Fe-doped Mn-based Prussian blue hierarchical architecture
   for high-performance sodium ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrates (MnHCFs) have great potential as cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their large specific capacity, low cost, ecofriendly synthesis and high working voltage. Nevertheless, their cycling stability is limited by Jahn-Teller effect (JT-effect) of Mn3+, phase transitions and Mn2+ dissolution during the charging and discharging processes. Herein, an unconventional solid-liquid two-phase route is developed to fabricate a novel hierarchical nanostructure Na1.02Mn0.57Fe0.43[Fe(CN)6]0.63 center dot 1.39H2O in view of different solubility of raw material Na4Fe(CN)6.10H2O in the mixed solvent of ethanol and water. Benefiting from unique porous hierarchical architecture, good structural stability, high electrical conductivity and fast capacitive behavior, such Fe-doped MnHCF cathode has an outstanding rate capability with large discharging capacity of 127 mAh g-1 at 25 mA g-1 and 71 mAh g-1 at 1200 mA g-1, and an excellent cyclability with 120 mAh g-1 of specific capacity at 100 mA g-1 and 86% of capacity retention over 200 cycles. In particular, the facile and controllable synthesis process of Fe-doped MnHCFs make it accessible for large-scale applications.

TI Double-Shelled Ni-Fe-P/N-Doped Carbon Nanobox Derived from a Prussian
   Blue Analogue as an Electrode Material for K-Ion Batteries and Li-S
   Batteries
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Rational design, convenient fabrication, and application of double-shelled hollow architectures with well-defined morphology and multicompositions as electrodes for rechargeable batteries still remain great challenges. Herein, double-shelled Ni-Fe P/N-doped carbon nanoboxes (defined as Ni-Fe-P/NC) were synthesized and then applied as electrode materials for potassium ion batteries (KIBs) and Li-S batteries, first. The unique architectures could not only alleviate volume changes and prevent aggregation of Ni-Fe-P/NC during cycling but could also provide efficient surface areas for infiltration of electrolyte. Additionally, nitrogen-doped carbon could improve the conductivity of the electrode. Hence, when these Ni-Fe-P/NC nanoboxes were applied as anode materials for KIBs, they delivered enhanced cycling stability (172.9 mA h g(-1) after 1600 cycles at 500 mA g(-1) and 115 mA h g(-1) after 2600 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1)). Meanwhile, the Ni-Fe-P/NC could also be used as the sulfur host material for Li-S batteries; benefiting from its unique hollow structure, it can accommodate high sulfur loading and have strong chemical adsorption ability to polysulfides.

TI Cr dopant regulating d-orbital electronic configuration of NiFe spinel
   oxide to improve oxygen evolution reaction in Zn-air battery
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Significant advancements towards enhancing the catalytic activity of spinel ferrites in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been achieved, however, further studies are required on this regard. In this study, Cr-doped spinel ferrite (NiFe2O4) embedded in N-doped C (Cr-NiFe2O4@NC) was synthesized via a high-temperature treatment using an NiFe Prussian blue analog as a precursor and K2Cr2O7 as a Cr source. Owing to the strong octahedral site preference energy, Cr3+ ions were successfully doped into octahedral sites and tailored the electronic configuration of NiFe2O4, as confirmed by XPS. The Cr-substituted Cr-NiFe2O4@NC exhibited the overpotential of 241 mV at 10 mA cm- 2, which was smaller than that of NiFe2O4@NC (266 mV) at the same current density. Meanwhile, the Tafel slope of Cr-NiFe2O4@NC (65.32 mV dec-1) was also lower than that of NiFe2O4@NC (86.96 mV dec-1). Therefore, the Cr substitution can improve the electrocatalytic OER performance of NiFe2O4@NC. In particular, an assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery using Cr-NiFe2O4@NC as the cathode catalyst afforded a high power density (61.1 mA cm- 2) together with a high specific capacity (740 mA g- 1). Amazingly, it could power light-emitting diodes, demonstrating its real-world application. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Cr ion doping led to electron transfer in NiFe2O4, resulting in a density of electronic states close to the Fermi level, which probably regulated the adsorption/desorption behaviors of oxygenate intermediates (*O and *OOH), thus promoting the reaction kinetics of the OER. This study provides a helpful basis for the development of spinel oxides with high electrocatalytic OER activity and durability via cation doping.

TI Synthesis of cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles and its hydrogen
   storage properties
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB In the present paper, we report hydrogen storage properties of cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles as a function of temperature. Cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles were synthesized by facile chemical precipitation method. The resulted compound forms FCC structure analogous to Prussian blue and is found to be stable up to 550 K. Presence of characteristic absorption bands in the range of 2000-2300 cm(-1) in IR spectra corresponds to the CN stretching frequency of Fe(III)-C=N-Co(II) sequence and this confirms the formation of Prussian blue analogues. Hydrogen adsorption studies were performed at variable temperatures. The effect of precursor concentration on hydrogen storage property has been investigated and interestingly, with increase in cobalt precursor concentration, hydrogen storage capacity is found to decrease. This correlates well with openness of the crystal structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on hydrogen storage properties of cobalt hexacyanoferrate.

TI Charge Transfer, Change of the Spin Value, and Driving of Magnetic Order
   by Pressure in Bimetallic Molecular Complexes
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB The magnetic bimetallic molecular-based compounds attract considerable attention because of their unique characteristics which are very different from those of traditional magnets. We demonstrate the effects of charge transfer as well as spin and magnetic order changes induced by high hydrostatic pressure applied to the two bimetallic multifunctional Prussian blue analogues, K0.1Co4[Fe-(CN)(6)](2.7)18H(2)O and K0.5Mn3[Fe(CN)(6)](2.14)6H(2)O. Two opposite directions of change in their properties under pressure are revealed: (i) the magnetization reduction and magnetic order disappearing for the K0.1Co4[Fe(CN)(6)](2.7)18H(2)O compound and (ii) an increase of the magnetization and change of the sign of exchange coupling for the K0.5Mn3[Fe(CN)(6)](2.14)6H(2)O compound. It is a first observation of both the magnetic moment increase and transformation from ferrimagnetic order to ferromagnetic order that appear under pressure in Prussian blue analogues. The latter is explained by the charge transfer between the metallic ions resulting in the corresponding spin transitions.

TI Ultra-stable Cu-ion-exchanged cobalt hexacyanoferrate(<sc>ii</sc>) in
   aqueous copper-ion storage
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Since Prussian blue analogues possess large vacant sites and available diffusion channels, they can accommodate and release a variety of cations. In this work, CuCoFe(CN)(6) as a member of the Prussian blue analogues is used as an electrode material in aqueous copper-ion batteries. It is prepared by coprecipitation and ion-exchange and is composed of small flaky particles with sizes varying from 30 to 800 nm. The CuCoFe(CN)(6) electrode exhibits high initial discharge capacity (61.0 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C), long-term cycling life (a capacity retention of 97.2% after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and a capacity retention of 86.5% after 1000 cycles at 15 C), and excellent rate performance. The Cu-storage mechanism is systematically investigated. The results reveal that CuCoFe(CN)(6) exhibits a stable structure and possesses good reversibility during the extraction/insertion of Cu2+ from/into its lattice. Furthermore, a full cell with a Zn anode and a CuCoFe(CN)(6) cathode exhibits stable cycling performance and a high operating voltage of 1.85 V, showing its practicability. Overall, this work reports an applicable electrode material for high-performance aqueous copper-ion batteries, which greatly promises the evolution of aqueous metal-ion batteries.

TI Performance and lifetime of intercalative water deionization cells for
   mono- and divalent ion removal
SO DESALINATION
AB Intercalative deionization (IDI) uses two cation intercalation electrodes separated by an anion exchange membrane in a symmetric cell design that has the potential to deliver electrochemically desalinated water in an energy-and water-efficient way. Here, we define and measure metrics to describe the performance and lifetime of IDI cells and compare them for NaCl and CaCl2 feed solutions. With 20 mM NaCl, NiHCF/AEM/NiHCF flow cells achieve 10 mM average concentration change at a productivity of 20 l/h/m(2) and 5 mM average concentration change at 130 l/h/m(2). In both cases the cells are operated at a 3C current rate and consume similar to 30 Wh/m(3) of energy. With 10 mM CaCl2, the specific capacity and salt removal of IDI flow cells is similar to 4 times lower. NiHCF/ NiHCF beaker cells with CaCl2 electrolyte suffer from strong capacity fade, while the same cells with NaCl electrolyte achieve 500 cycles without any capacity fade. Our post-mortem analysis using X-ray diffraction, secondary electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy and micro X-ray fluorescence mapping reveals that NiHCF dissolves upon repeated intercalation with Ca2+, releasing residual K+, Ni2+ andFe(CN)(6)(3), which precipitates as a crystalline decomposition product on the electrodes. This side reaction deprives the active material NiHCF of charge compensating Fe, and thus accounts for the observed capacity fade.

AB Recently, Prussian blue and its analogues (PBs) have been widely investigated as cathode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but have rarely been reported as anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we develop a novel and facile method to prepare highly crystalline and low-defect Prussian blue (PB) materials with a unique concave hierarchical structure, which significantly improves the stability of the materials and increases the active sites. The single crystal-like electron diffraction behavior observed in the SAED pattern and XPS data demonstrates their mesocrystalline nature and modified surface structure, respectively. More importantly, compared with iron ferricyanide previously reported, their discharge capacity has grown by 70% after the same number of cycles (100 cycles) at 1C, and the Li-storage performance is generally better than that of other PBs. As a novel material, the formation mechanism of the unique structure is investigated intensively and the effect of the structure on electrochemical performance is also explained.

TI Air Plasma Activation of Catalytic Sites in a Metal-Cyanide Framework
   for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Targeted activation of highly ordered and distributed metal sites in nanoporous frameworks is a generic strategy to develop high-performance catalysts. The key challenge is to achieve such activation without damaging the frameworks. Here it is demonstrated that atmospheric-pressure low-temperature plasma generated in air improve catalytic properties of an Fe/Co bimetallic cyanide framework through the specific soft incorporation of reactive oxygen species without affecting the framework structure. The bonding and oxidative states of the high-density catalytic metal sites in the framework are modified while the nanoporous nature of the framework is retained, which leads to superior catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction at high current densities close to the operation conditions of commercial alkaline electrolyzers.

TI Multi-array wax paper-based platform for the pre-concentration and
   determination of silver ions in drinking water
SO TALANTA
AB In this work, a wax-patterned chromatographic paper has been utilized as a holistic platform to 1) synthesize Prussian Blue Nanoparticles (sensing species), 2) load the reagents for the assay, 3) concentrate the sample through multistep, and 4) visualize the determination of silver ions. Waters are continuously affected by changes in the composition, thus the utilization of reagent-free analytical tools is of huge interest for smart drinking water monitoring. Herein, we report the characterization and application of a multi-array paper-based platform for the colorimetric determination of silver ions based on the conversion from Prussian Blue to its silver-based analogue, namely Ag-4[Fe(CN)(6)]. In particular, the platform highlights the increase of sensitivity due to paper pre-concentration of sample, that can be easily adapted to the analytical necessities. Within the proposed experimental setup, Ag+ is visualized down to a detection limit of 0.9 mu M, with high repeatability and satisfactory recoveries in the range comprised between 90 and 113%.

TI Polyaniline-Cobalt Hexacyanoferrate Composites as High-Performance
   Cathodes for Zn-Ion Hybrid Supercapacitor
SO ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
AB Zn-based hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) have received increasing attention in recent research, due to their high electrochemical performance and low cost. Herein, a composite cathode is developed based on polyaniline (PANI) and cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF), exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance. The results showed that PANI is coated on CoHCF, thereby enhancing the electrical conductivity and Zn2+ transport kinetics. As a result, the as-prepared materials demonstrate remarkable specific capacitance (741.7 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1)), good cycling durability (86.15% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles at 10 A g(-1)), high peak energy density (312 Wh kg(-1) at 500 W kg(-1)), and superior power density (75 294 W kg(-1) at 25 Wh kg(-1)). The excellent electrochemical performance confirms that PANI-CoHCF composites are promising cathode candidates for ZHSCs in practical applications.

TI Radiation effects, zero thermal expansion, and pressure-induced phase
   transition in CsMnCo(CN)6
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The Prussian blue analogue CsMnCo(CN)(6) is studied using powder X-ray and neutron diffraction under variable temperature, pressure, and X-ray exposure. It retains cubic F43m symmetry in the range 85-500 K with minimal thermal expansion, whereas a phase transition to P4n2 occurs at similar to 2 GPa, driven by octahedral tilting. A small lattice contraction occurs upon increased X-ray dose. Comparisons with related systems indicate that the Cs-I ions decrease the thermal expansion and suppress the likelihood of phase transformations. The results improve the understanding of the stimuli-responsive behaviour of coordination polymers.

TI Amorphous quaternary alloy phosphide hierarchical nanoarrays with
   pagoda-like structure grown on Ni foam as pH-universal electrocatalyst
   for hydrogen evolution reaction
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Alloy phosphides as one of the most prospect materials are used in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of their adjustable composition, electronic structure and optimized activation energy for the electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, amorphous quaternary alloy phosphide NiCoFeP@NiCoP/NF with pagoda-like hierarchical nanoarrays structure grown on Ni foam is synthesized. The synergy effect between alloy components, the superior hierarchical nanoarrays structure and superaerophobic characteristic enables NiCoFeP@NiCoP/NF to be a pH-Universal electrocatalyst with high electrocatalytic performance toward HER and simulated seawater. To achieve 10 mA cm(-2), this catalyst just required overpotential of 77, 136 and 184 mV in alkaline, acidic and neutral aqueous solution. The NiCo2O4@Ni [Fe (CN)(6)]/NF has stable HER performance (over 10 h) and a Faradic efficiency of 90.5% in simulated seawater. This work is expected to open up a new road for the construction of amorphous alloy phosphides with hierarchical nanoarrays structure for energy storage and conversion.

TI The finding of nickel extraction material: How nickel ferrocyanide offer
   excess capacity
SO NANO TODAY
AB In alkali metal ion batteries, insoluble ferrocyanide with few alkali metal ions can provide excess initial charge capacity which is much higher than the contribution from the extraction of alkali metal ions. Why? This commonly encountered fatal problem about Prussian blue analogues is solved in this work. When nickel ferrocyanide cycled in sodium ion half cell, an unexpected side product is formed. On the basis of this fact, we propose nickel ferrocyanide as a new nickel extraction material. According to a systematic spectroscopy investigation, this material has stable structure, small lattice variation and reversible redox couple of C-coordinated Fe3+/Fe2+, resulting in its excellent electrochemical performance. The electrode thereby provides 83.6% of initial discharge capacity after 300 cycles. The abnormal lattice expansion upon charging is also elaborated. Additionally, we also construct a full nickel-ion cell in configuration of nickel ferrocyanide/NiCl2 aqueous electrolyte/Ni as a proof of concept. It shows a higher operating voltage than Daniell cell and good cycling performance. This work proposes a new finding for aqueous Ni batteries via uncoupling the excess capacity phenomenon, which will benefit and inspire the development of Prussian blue analogues and aqueous Ni batteries.

TI Integration of Cobalt Metal-Organic Frameworks into an Interpenetrated
   Prussian Blue Analogue to Derive Dual Metal-Organic Framework-Assisted
   Cobalt Iron Derivatives for Enhancing Electrochemical Total Water
   Splitting
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB It is important to design a highly efficient, cost-effective, and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for the overall water splitting process to produce both oxygen and hydrogen, which is considered as one of the most promising methods for alternative renewable sources. In this study, a highly porous dual metal-organic framework (MOF) based bimetallic cobalt-iron phosphide and oxide nanoarrays were developed on nickel foam by a two-step liquid phase deposition process followed by calcination and phosphatization. As-synthesized MOF bimetallic derivatives act as effective bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is interesting to note that the optimized electrochemical efficiency for OER and HER was achieved by MOF CoFeP nanoarrays with an overpotential of 310 mV and 200 mV offering a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2). In addition, an integrated water electrolyzer is developed using MOF CoFeP as an anode and cathode, requiring a cell voltage of 1.78 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. Our findings suggest that the ligand exchange conversion of the interpenetrated MOF network into an abundant porous structure could have a powerful synergistic effect on the overall water splitting reaction in an alkaline medium.

TI A salt-free aqueous battery system: Insights into proton dynamics and
   electrochemical mechanisms
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB In this study, we developed a novel aqueous secondary battery system that utilizes a salt-free electrolyte composed solely of water, eliminating the need for conventional salts. Using copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) as the electrode material, we conducted electrochemical tests that confirmed the effective operation of the battery, demonstrating typical charge/discharge behavior in the salt-free electrolyte. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance revealed changes in 1H chemical shifts during the charge/discharge processes, providing evidence of proton insertion and deinsertion within the CuHCF structure. These findings were further supported by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which elucidated the role of protons in the electrolytes of electrochemical redox reactions. The protons generated by the self-ionization of water appeared to serve as charge carriers, enabling efficient battery operation without adding salt. The salt-free electrolyte system may offer significant cost advantages and potential environmental benefits, suggesting its potential as a next- generation energy storage solution.

SO ENERGIES
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrate (Mn-PBA) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion secondary battery (SIB) with high average voltage (=3.4 V) against Na. Here, we find that the thermal decomposition of glucose modifies the surface state of Mn-PBA, without affecting the bulk crystal structure. The glucose treatment significantly improves the rate properties of Mn-PBA in SIB. The critical discharge rate increases from 1 C (as-grown) to 15 C (glucose-treated). Our observation suggests that thermal treatment is quite effective for insulating coordination polymers.

TI Giant Negative Thermal Expansion in Ultralight NaB(CN)4
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Negative thermal expansion (NTE) is crucial for controlling the thermomechanical properties of functional materials, albeit being relatively rare. This study reports a giant NTE (alpha(V)similar to-9.2 & sdot; 10(-5) K-1, 100-200 K; alpha(V)similar to-3.7 & sdot; 10(-5) K-1, 200-650 K) observed in NaB(CN)(4), showcasing interesting ultralight properties. A comprehensive investigation involving synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations has been conducted to explore the thermal expansion mechanism. The findings indicate that the low-frequency phonon modes play a primary role in NTE, and non-rigid vibration modes with most negative Gr & uuml;neisen parameters are the key contributing factor to the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)(4). This work presents a new material with giant NTE and ultralight mass density, providing insights for the understanding and design of novel NTE materials.

AB Metal organic polymers (MOPs), including metal coordination polymers (CPs, one-dimensional), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, two-/three-dimensional), Prussian blue (PB) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), have recently emerged as promising electrochemically active materials for energy storage and conversion systems. Due to the tunability of their composition and the structural versatility, diverse electrochemical behaviors for multi-electron reactions, fast-ion diffusion, and small volume change of electrodes could be achieved upon charging and discharging. Because of these superiorities, MOPs are considered as effective substitutes for future advanced energy storage systems. Here, we summarize the recent progress in pristine MOPs as electrode candidates for rechargeable lithium and sodium ion batteries. The working mechanisms and strategies for enhancing the electrochemical performance in related advanced electrochemical energy storage (EES) applications are also highlighted in this review.

TI Sodium-rich iron hexacyanoferrate with nickel doping as a high

SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Na-rich NaxFeFe(CN)(6) (NFF) in terms of low cost and high theoretical capacity has been considered to be a potential cathode material for aqueous sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, low sodium content, poor Columbic efficiency (CE) and rapid capacity degradation impede their practical application. Herein, the effect of low-level Ni doping in NFF as cathode materials in 1 M NaNO3 electrolyte has been investigated, which were synthesized via a citrate-assisted co-precipitation route. NFF substituted with 23% Ni2+ exhibited the best electrochemical behaviors, which delivers a discharge capacity of 105.9 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) and 73.1% capacity retention over 1000 cycles with an average CE of 99.8% at 1000 mA g(-1). A reversible capacity of 55.5 mAh g(-1) can be obtained even at a high current density of 2000 mA g(-1). The Ni substitution strategy was evidenced to be a scalable method to prepare promising cathode materials with excellent cycling stability for high-performance aqueous SIBs.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) junctions based on n-Si have proven to be effective electrodes in terms of electrocatalysis activity and durability for performing photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Here, we show that the modification of n-Si MIS systems with CoFe Prussian blue (CoFePB) and NiRu Prussian blue (NiRuPB) analogues can modify their properties and allow a direct probing of the interfacial energetics through their redox feature. Our investigations demonstrate the importance of the preparation route and attribute the large upward photovoltage variation found in n-Si/SiOx/Ni/NiRuPB to the increasing inhomogeneity of the metal thin film. Finally, the optimal photoanode was tested for oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions. Our findings provide important insights on MIS photoanodes for future development in the field of solar fuel production.

TI Heat treatment-induced Co<SUP>3+</SUP> enrichment in CoFePBA to enhance
   OER electrocatalytic performance
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB Increasing active metal sites is a valid approach to improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Co3+ is the main active metal site of Co-based catalysts. In this research work, through the partial transformation of CoFePBA (CFP) via low-temperature heat treatment, the effective control of the Co3+/Co2+ ratio has been achieved. The partial transformation strategy of low-temperature heat treatment can not only maintain the original framework structure of CFP, but also increase more active sites. The characterization results show that the CFP-200 sample obtained via heat treatment at 200 degrees C for 2 h under N-2 atmosphere has the highest Co3+/Co2+ ratio. As an oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, CFP-200 shows the best electrocatalytic activity among all samples. In 1.0 mol/L KOH electrolyte, the overpotential is 312 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Therefore, low-temperature heat treatment provides an effective method for preparing low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts.

TI Zinc ferro- and ferri-cyanides catalyst structures from point of colloid
   chemistry view
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB The aim of this research was to comprehensively analyze zinc ferro- and ferri-cyanides for rationally choose or modify hexacyanoferrates in a range of application focused on catalysing the ring-opening copolymerization of epoxides and CO2 to reduce the environmental toll. Scripts of the synthesis of 14 samples with variable morphology are given. Thermogravimetry, FT-IR, and XRD indicates the formation of two predominant types of bridging cyanide groups with different coordination environment, which accounts for a lack crystallinity aggregate with an amorphous part. Involving dynamic light scattering and laser Doppler electrophoresis as distinguishing features the formation of colloidal fractions is demonstrated and characterized. The switch from a negative surface rich in Lewis basic sites (Me-C---N-) to a surface rich in open-metal sites is either jump and stepwise successfully completed. The proposed structures of micelles of the catalysts allow great attention to be paid to every small detail of their catalytic activity.

TI Graphene oxide/chitosan/potassium copper hexacyanoferrate(II) composite
   aerogel for efficient removal of cesium
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Efficient removal of 137Cs from various radioactive wastewater and contaminated environment is much meaningful for nuclear energy sustainable development and public health. Herein we used chitosan (CS) to induce the self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO) into a hydrogel (GO/CS) possessing a three-dimensional macroporous structure and produced a type of ternary composite hydrogel/aerogel named GO/CS/Cu-PBA by in situ growing potassium copper hexacyanoferrate(II) (Cu-PBA) nanoparticles onto the GO/CS via simple leaching. The adsorption behaviors of Cs+ by GO, Cu-PBA, and GO/CS/Cu-PBA in various matrice was systematically studied and compared. It was found that the GO/CS/Cu-PBA exhibited satisfactory sorption capacity for Cs+ (64.7 mg/g) and ultrafast kinetics. In addition, a fixed-bed column system could be employed for the cleanup of Cs+ from contaminated groundwater. Further FT-IR, XRD, XPS, and EXAFS analyses clarified the interaction mechanism between Cs+ and GO/CS/Cu-PBA. Highly selective fixation of Cs+ by Cu-PBA was accompanied by the release of K+/Cu2+ and a crystalline phase transition. The adsorption of Cs+ by GO was mainly correlated with the electrostatic attraction by -COO- and C-OH groups. The confinement of Cu-PBA by GO/CS aerogel is of much potential for the practical treatment of cesium-containing radioactive wastewater.

TI Surface Lattice Modulation Stabilizes
   K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] Cathode for High-Energy K-Ion
   Batteries
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are considered as competitive candidates for energy storage applications due to their abundant resources and low cost. K2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] (KMnF) is an ideal cathode for PIBs because of its high theoretical specific energy (approximate to 600 Wh kg(-1)). However, it suffers from severe Mn dissolution and complex phase transitions caused by Jahn-Teller distortion, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Here, a simple, controllable and universal "transition metal (TM2+) ion exchange" strategy is proposed to modulate the surface lattice of KMnF, not only stabilizing the structure but also maintaining its inherent high capacity. The surface Mn2+ is substituted by TM2+, including Fe2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, or Co2+, forming heterogeneous protection layer. Especially when the surface Mn2+ is modified by redox-active Fe2+, it exhibits a capacity as high as 144 mAh g(-1) and considerable energy density of 560 Wh kg(-1) and a remarkable capacity retention (86% after 1,000 cycles at 50 mA g(-1), and 71% after 5,000 cycles at 1,000 mA g(-1), respectively). The surface-modified KMnF cathode proved to be effective in stabilizing the structure by preventing the Mn dissolution and formation of tetragonal phase caused by Jahn-Teller distortion. This work provides a simple and universal strategy for stabilizing high-energy Mn-based cathode.

TI Casting and recycling of insoluble, labile single-crystal coordination
   polymer through reversible solid-liquid-solid transition
SO MATTER
AB Reversible solid-liquid-solid transition controlled by temperature or solvent plays a vital role in manufacturing and recycling many impor-tant materials. However, this kind of transition is hard to be realized for insoluble and labile materials, for instance coordination polymers. In this work, we introduce a volatile dissociating agent to realize reversible liquification and solidification of a kind of coordination poly-mer, Prussian blue. The Prussian blue powders are disassociated into electrolytic solution by hydrochloride acid (the volatile dissociating agent) and transformed back to solids via volatilization of the hydro-chloride vapor. Using this solid-liquid-solid transition, Prussian blue powders are cast into single crystals with various shapes (i.e., inverse opal, mesoporous) or single-crystal matrix composites with functional networks encapsulated (i.e., carbon, silicon, TiO2). Significant improve-ments of the performance of Prussian blue in secondary battery, seawater battery, water treatment, etc., are observed after casting. Moreover, all of the cast Prussian blue materials can be recycled.

TI Engineering heterostructured Co0.7Fe0.3@Co doped
   leaf-like carbon nanoplates from dual metal-organic frameworks for
   high-efficiency oxygen reduction reaction in microbial fuel cell
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Microbial fuel cell (MFC) satisfies the needs of power generation and pollutants removal but still requires active electrocatalysts to accelerate cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Metal-nitrogen-carbon materials (M NCs) derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), known for low cost and high yield, fail with satisfactory surface structure and their intrinsic activity requires to be further improved. Here, a MOF@MOF precursor (CoZIF-L@CoFe PBA-1, MOF: metal-Organic framework) is skillfully fabricated by utilizing two-dimensional (2D) leaf-like cobalt-based zeolitic-imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF-L) as the mother MOF to give birth to cobalt iron Prussian blue analogue (CoFe PBA) by adjusting reaction time and solvents with a ligand exchange method. After carbonization, Co-ZIF-L@CoFe PBA-1 transforms into a leaf-shaped carbon nanoplate with heterostructured CoFe alloy and Co (Co0.7Fe0.3@Co-NC-1), which exhibits outstanding ORR activity and high MFC performance (2486 +/- 56 mW m(-2)) compared with Co-NC and Co0.7Fe0.3-NC derived from Co-ZIF-L and leaf-like CoFe PBA, respectively. The interfacial Co0.7Fe0.3@Co efficiently optimizes electronic structure for fast electrons transfer and the porous carbon matrix provides desirable surface structure for oxygen transfer, synergistically triggering a high ORR activity. Our work offers new insights for controllable preparation of PBAs-based dual-MOFs precursors and provides a feasible avenue for enhancing the activity of PBAs-based M NCs catalysts.

TI Understanding the role of guest ions in the control of thermal expansion
   of FeFe(CN)6
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Understanding the role of guest species in framework materials is important to successfully achieve the control of thermal expansion. In this work, the thermal expansion of the Prussian blue analogue FeFe(CN)6 has been effectively tailored from negative, to zero to positive through the insertion of Na+ ions. To shed light on the role of Na+ ions on thermal expansion behavior, a joint study was conducted by means of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction, EXAFS spectroscopy and lattice dynamics calculations. It has been found out that the insertion of Na+ ions reduces the structural flexibility of the CN linkages and affects the low-energy phonons, thus allowing the tuning of the overall thermal expansion. This work demonstrates the possibility of precisely controlling the thermal expansion of open-framework materials by inserting guest ions and clarifies the physical mechanism underlying this control.

TI Preparation of Ni-Co PBA-derived beaded NiSe2/CoSe2/CNT for high-
   performance supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Electrochemical energy storage is a growing field, highly conductive metallic selenium has emerged as an electrode material that shows great promise. In this study, tandem NiSe2/CoSe2 nanocubes with carbon nanotubes (CNT) as their structural backbone were created by employing the easy chemical precipitation and heat treatment selenization approach. Controlling the CNT inclusion during the chemical precipitation process allowed researchers to examine the effects of variations in CNT content on the electrochemical characteristics of NiSe2/CoSe2/CNT. The findings demonstrated that metal selenides made with CNT out-performed those without CNT. At a current density of 1 A g-1, NiSe2/CoSe2/CNT-20 with 20 mg CNT mass exhibited an electrochemical properties of 848 F g-1. Additionally, the combination NiSe2/CoSe2/CNT-20/AC asymmetric supercapacitor also displayed an energy density of 50 Wh kg-1 when at power density of 800.0 W kg-1, and it has good cycling stability (Cycle stability reached a high of 62% after 1000 cycles), demonstrating that NiSe2/CoSe2/CNT-20 is a viable electrode material for storing energy and has further research potential.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Synthesis of Fe3O4 nanocubes anchored in
   MgCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays for flexible
   all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The design of novel heterostructure with multifunctional characteristics is of great technical significance for the development of new energy storage devices. However, the lower conductivity of metal oxides and the accumulation caused by irreversible phase transition after multiple cycles are the main reasons for the low specific capacitance and cycle life. Herein, we synthesized bimetallic oxide MgCo2O4 nanoneedles with a spinel structure, and firmly anchored Fe3O4 nanocubes on MgCo2O4 nanoneedles by ion-exchange strategy. Thanks to the constructed heterostructure of nanoneedles/nanocubes, the introduction of Fe3O4 effectively improves the electron transport path in MgCo2O4 during repeated charging and discharging, and increases the effective activation sites involved in electron transfer. As a result, a higher specific capacitance of 1648 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and an ultra-long cycle life of 78.6% capacitance retention after 6000 continuous charge/discharge cycles are obtained. A flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapcitor assembled with MgCo2O4-Fe3O4 as positive electrode and AC as negative electrode can deliver an ultra-high energy density of 78 Wh kg(-1) and maximum power density of 1.2 kW kg(-1), as well as extraordinary capacitive retention of 75.2% after 10,000 cycles. These excellent properties reveal the potential and application value of MgCo2O4-Fe3O4 in the development of high-performance supercapacitors. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI Magnetic order in a metal thiocyanate perovskite-analogue
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB Metal thiocyanate perovskite-analogues are a growing class of materials, but although they contain paramagnetic cations there have been no reports of their magnetic properties. Due to the large separations between the paramagnetic cations, with a shortest through-bond distance of 15.1 angstrom, these materials might be expected to be good examples of paramagnets. In this communication we investigate the magnetic properties of a metal thiocyanate framework Cr[Bi(SCN)(6)]center dot xH(2)O. We find that Cr[Bi(SCN)(6)]center dot xH(2)O undergoes long-range magnetic order at T-N = 4.0(2) K. We use neutron powder diffraction to determine that Cr[Bi(SCN)(6)]center dot xH(2)O has a MnO-type {111}(cubic)-ordering as its ground state, consistent with frustrated nearest- and next-nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions. This suggests that appropriate design of metal thiocyanate perovskite-analogue structures may reveal a rich vein of frustrated magnetism.

TI Dehydration Conditions and Ultrafast Rehydration of Prussian White:
   Phase Transition Dynamics and Implications for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Prussian White (PW) is a strategic cathode material for sodium-ion batteries, offering a high theoretical capacity and voltage. However, the crystalline structure and the electrochemical performance of PW strongly depend on the hydration level, which is difficult to control, leading to discrepancies in the results and interpretations presented in the literature. This work aims to provide a deeper insight into the dehydration process of PW materials and a better understanding of the impact of their fast rehydration, upon exposure to moisture, on their characterization. For this purpose, a Na1.87Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.99<middle dot>1.99H2O sample was synthesized by a coprecipitation method and subsequently dehydrated to remove water. After thorough characterization, our findings show that drying parameters, such as temperature and pressure, strongly influence the post-drying result. Moreover, the dehydrated samples rehydrate within minutes of exposure to air, which may explain some discrepancies observed in the literature and highlights the necessity to work under fully air-tight conditions.

TI Framework materials for supercapacitors
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY REVIEWS
AB Framework materials, including metal-organic framework materials (MOFs), Prussian blue/Prussian blue analogs (PB/PBAs), and covalent framework materials (COFs), are promising candidates for fabricating electrodes for use in electrochemical devices, especially supercapacitors. Supercapacitors have been widely investigated over the past decade. Active materials as electrode materials are vital to the development of the next generation of supercapacitors. Therefore, designing and fabricating novel electrode materials endowed with superior specific capacitance, perfect cycling stabilities, and distinguished power/energy density are crucial. In this review, we focus on framework materials - MOFs, PB/PBAs, and COFs - and report electrode materials based on their pristine forms, derivatives, and composites for supercapacitors. Recent advances and potential applications of framework materials in supercapacitors are also discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for the future direction of supercapacitors based on framework materials.

The nanocomposite presented well distributed similar to 89 nm particles entrenched in wrinkled graphene sheets. The electrochemical behavior of RTD on the nanocomposite surface was examined by cyclic voltammetry, and its mass transport process was evaluated by scan rate test. The parameters of the amperometry with batch-injection analysis (BIA) system for RTD determination were optimized, and the calibration curve presented high linearity (R-2= 0.999) from5.0 to 100.0 mu mol L-1, good sensitivity of 0.216 mu AL mu mol(-1), and a limit of detection (LD) of 274.4 nmol L-1. RTD from pharmacological samples was successfully determined, with approximately 95% of recovery.

TI Coupling Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes with reduced graphene oxide for
   high-rate and long-cycle-life potassium storage
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB As one of prussian blue analogues, Co3[Co(CN)6]2 has been explored as a promising anode material for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) owing to its high potassium storage capacity. Unfortunately, Co3[Co (CN)6]2 possesses low electronic conductivity and its structure collapses easily during potassiation and depotassiation, resulting in poor rate performance and cyclic stability. To solve these problems, we develop a facile multi-step method to successfully combine uniform Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes with rGO by C-O-Co bonds. As expected, these chemcial bonds shorten the distance between Co3[Co (CN)6]2 and rGO to the angstrom meter level, which significantly improve the electronic conductivity of Co3[Co(CN)6]2. Besides, the complete encapsulation of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes by rGO endows the structure of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 with high stability, thus withstanding repeated insertion/extraction of potassium-ions without visible morphological and structural changes. Benefiting from the abovementioned structural advantages, the Co3[Co(CN)6]2/rGO nanocomposite exhibits a high reversible capacity of 400.8 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, an exceptional rate capability of 115.5 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1, and an ultralong cycle life of 231.9 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Additionally, the effects of different amounts of rGO and different sizes of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes on the potassium storage performance are also studied. This work offers an ideal route to significantly enhance the electrochemical properties of prussian blue analogues. ? 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI Sandwich-like superstructure of in-situ self-assembled
   hetero-structured carbon nanocomposite for improving electrocatalytic
   oxygen reduction
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Developing efficient and highly low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly desirable and challenging for renewable energy devices. In this work, a novel sandwich-like heterostructured nanocomposite was facilely constructed via incorporation of Co9S8 nanoclusters/Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanocubes in N,S-doped carbon multilayers (Co9S8/Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)/N,S-CMLs) by a one-pot coordination-modulated pyrolysis of a mixture containing dicyandiamide, Co(NO3)(2 a)nd Evans blue at 800 & DEG;C. The control tests demonstrated critical roles of the pyrolysis temperature played on the final morphology and shape, and discussed the formation mechanism in detail. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited appealing electrocatalytic performance for ORR with a more positive onset potential (E-onset = 0.96 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.87 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, far outperforming other home-made catalysts and commercial Pt/C. This work opens a new avenue to prepare efficient, costeffectiveness and stable electrocatalysts in sustainable energy storage and conversion devices.(C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Composites based on nitroprusside cyano-bridged coordination polymer
   particles and chitosan for NO delivery
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB We report the design of new composite films {Fe[Fe(CN)(5)(NO)]}(0.55)@C6H11NO4 and {Ag-2[Fe(CN)(5)(NO)]}(0.28)@C6H11NO4 based on cyano-bridged coordination polymers Fe-II[Fe-II(CN)(5)(NO)] or Ag-2(I)[Fe-II(CN)(5)(NO)] grown into a chitosan matrix that are able to provide a slow NO radical release under white light irradiation. The characterisation methods such as X-ray diffraction, TGA, SEM-EDX, IR and UV-vis spectroscopies show that these composites are made of ca. 50 wt% of the cyano-bridged coordination polymer as microcrystalline particles embedded into chitosan films. Irradiation for 7 days by using white light results in initiating a 6.5 and 10.6% NO radical delivery for {Fe[Fe(CN)(5)(NO)]}(0.55)@C6H11NO4 and {Ag-2[Fe(CN)(5)(NO)]}(0.28)@C6H11NO4, respectively. The rearrangement of the cyano-bridged coordination compounds after the NO departure leads to the formation of Prussian blue or silver Prussian blue analogues, which limits the unwanted release of cyanide as a side effect.

TI Selective Pseudocapacitive Deionization of Calcium Ions in Copper
   Hexacyanoferrate
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB In recent years, the capacitive deionization (CDI) technology has gradually become a promising technology for hard water treatment. Up to now, most of the work for water softening in CDI was severely limited by the inferior selectivity and electrosorption performances of carbon-based electrodes in spite of combining Ca2+-selective ion-exchange resin or membranes. Pseudocapacitive electrode materials that selectively interact with specific ions by Faradic redox reactions or ion (de)intercalation offer an alternative strategy for highly selective electrosorption of Ca2+ from water because of brilliant ion adsorption capacity. Here, we first used copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) as a pseudocapacitive electrode to methodically study the selective pseudocapacitive deionization of Ca2+ over Na+ and Mg2+. Using the hybrid CDI cell consisting of a CuHCF cathode and an activated carbon anode without any ion-exchange membrane, the outstanding Ca2+ electrosorption capacity of 42.8 mg.g(-1) and superior selectivity &(Ca2+/Na+) of 3.05 at a molar ratio of 10:1 were obtained at 1.4 V, surpassing those of the reported carbon-based electrodes. Finally, electrochemical measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided an in-depth understanding of the selective pseudocapacitive deionization of Ca2+ ions in a CuHCF electrode. Our study would be helpful for developing high-efficiency selective electrosorption of target charged ions by intrinsic properties of pseudocapacitive materials.

   matrix: effects of the metal ions and synthesis pathway on the
   microstructure and magnetic properties
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB The magnetic properties of nanoparticle assemblies strongly depend on the structural and morphological characteristics of the individual nanoparticles as well as on their organization within the assembly. Here, we present the synthesis of cobalt and/or iron oxide nanoparticles within the ordered mesoporosity of a silica monolith by two different synthesis pathways (using either Prussian blue analogues or nitrate salts as a precursor). We describe the influence of the nature of the metal ion and of the synthesis pathway on the morphology of the nanoparticles. With respect to these observations, we present and discuss the temperature-dependent magnetic behaviors of the final nanocomposites.

TI A Ni-doping-induced phase transition and electron evolution in cobalt
   hexacyanoferrate as a stable cathode for sodium-ion batteries
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Prussian blue analogues are potential competitive energy storage materials due to their diverse metal combinations and wide three-dimensional ion channels. Here, we prepared a new highly crystalline monoclinic nickel-doped cobalt hexacyanoferrate via a feasible and simple one-step co-precipitation method. In the process of sodium-ion de-intercalation, three stable charge and discharge platforms, which are consistent with the cyclic voltammetry performance, are seen for the first time, showing the function of nickel ions in Prussian blue. Furthermore, the charge transfer and structural evolution caused by the transmission of sodium ions were well revealed via ex situ XRD, ex situ XPS, and in situ EIS studies. Simulation calculations are performed relating to the energy band structure and the highest-occupied bonding orbitals of the system in different charge states, revealing the charge and discharge mechanism of the nickel-doped material and the reason for the emergence of the new platform at low voltages. In addition, NaNi0.17Co0.83Fe(CN)(6) also delivers a striking capacity of 146 mA h g(-1) and superior cyclability, with 93% capacity retention over 100 cycles; it can be considered as a promising alternative cathode material for use in sodium-ion batteries.

   3D reduced graphene aerogel with enhanced sodium ion batteries
   performance
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Developing advanced electrode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) to meet the urgent need of high per-formance is still challenging. In this study, a novel SIBs negative electrode composite material (N/(Ni, Co)Se2 NFCs@RGOA) was prepared by loading N-doped bimetal derived nano-framework cubes (N/(Ni, Co)Se2 NFCs) on reduced graphene oxide aerogel (RGOA). The nano-size and hollow cage structure of N/(Ni, Co)Se2 NFCs cooperate with the layered branched carbon skeleton and porous structure of RGOA to accelerate the reaction kinetics, therefore alleviate the structure collapse caused by volume expansion, and boost the conductivity of the material. The characterization and electrochemical testing results show that the electrode material has remarkable electrochemical performance (reversible capacity of 497 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), capacity stability (395 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles) and excellent rate performance (389 mA h g-1 at the current density of 2 A g-1). The as designed electrode material will play a significant role to benefit the development of SIBs and advanced electrical storage applications.

TI Growth of magnetic cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles onto bacterial
   cellulose nanofibers
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB Natural polymers templates capable to maneuver the growth and spatial distribution of functional nanoparticles have been furthering the development of a new generation of sustainable and versatile materials. Pure cellulose nanofibrils, biosynthesized by bacteria, naturally deliver a 3D interconnected network of lightweight, foldable and sustainable matrices. Cellulose membrane is an exceptional biodegradable and biocompatible and high mechanical strength substrate with a native fibrous structure that can be easily applied as a structure-directing host to produce nanosized materials with optical, electrical or magnetic properties. In this work, we investigated the preparation of magnetic membranes by using bacterial cellulose nanofibers to control the growth of molecule-based magnetic nanoparticles such as Prussian Blue analogs. Magnetic Cobalt-Prussian Blue (CoHCEFe) nanoparticles were synthesized in situ by hydrothermal method through a diffusion-limited precipitation process onto a bacterial cellulose nanofiber network. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy clearly unveiled a homogeneous distribution of immobilized COHCEFe crystalline nanoparticles whose size ranges from 94 to 70 nm as a function of nanoparticle content (up 28 wt%). Magnetic force microscopy showed that these nanometric COHCEFe crystalline nanoparticles well dispersed in BC fibers network respond to the magnetic field applied to the MFM-tip. This nano/nano association approach can provide functionally advanced materials for application in catalysis, adsorption of radionuclides, energy generation, data storage, biosensing, optical and magnetic devices.

TI Zinc hexacyanoferrate with open framework for efficient aqueous cobalt
   ions storage
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this work, we report a high-performance aqueous Co-ion battery with zinc hexacyanoferrate as Co2+ storage material. Owing to the open framework, zinc hexacyanoferrate exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible capacity of zinc hexacyanoferrate is up to 62.4 mAh g- 1 at 5C with ultralow capacity decay (0.0084 % per cycle) within 500 cycles. Even cycled at a higher rate of 10C, zinc hexacyanoferrate still can remain a high capacity retention of 98.8 % after 700 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the rapid kinetics behavior of Co2+ in the open and stable framework structure. Besides, a joint analysis of in-situ X-ray diffraction, ex-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy verifies the highly reversible structural change of zinc hexacyanoferrate during charge/ discharge process. All these evidences suggest that zinc hexacyanoferrate may be a promising host material for Co2+ storage in aqueous rechargeable batteries.

TI Comprehensive study of
   Na2-xMnFe(CN)6•yH2O cathodes with cube
   morphology: Structure, valence state and electrochemical properties
SO SOLID STATE IONICS
AB In this paper, we have synthesized cube-like Na2-xMnFe(CN)(6)center dot yH(2)O cathodes (C-Na2-xMnHFC) by controlling the nucleation rate during precipitation reaction. Meantime, we have systematically studied structure, chemical composition, and valence state of cube sample, as well as its electrochemical performances. Compared with rapidly crystallized Na2-xMnFe(CN)(6)center dot yH(2)O (R-Na2-xMnHFC), the C-Na2-xMnHFC exhibits a lower contents of Fe (CN)(6) defects and crystal water, higher crystalline and Na+ content. Besides, it delivers better electrochemical properties, which could obtain a high specific capacity of 133 mAh g(-1) and capacity retention rate of 80% after 100 cycles at 150 mA g(-1). And even when the current density increases to 300 mA g(-1), the capacity retention rate can still remain at 80%. Moreover, the discharge capacity reaches about 92% when the current density returns back to 15 mA g(-1) from 750 mA g(-1), revealing its better stability at various rates. These improvements in electrochemical performance are attributed to the positive influences of the cube-like structure, which could stabilize the structure upon cycling, increase the contact area between the electrodes and electrolytes, and enhances the Na+ ions diffusion coefficient.

TI Prussian White/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composite as Cathode Material to
   Enhance the Electrochemical Performance of Sodium-Ion Battery
SO LANGMUIR
AB Prussian white (PW) is considered a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, challenges, such as lattice defects and poor conductivity limit its application. Herein, the composite materials of manganese-iron based Prussian white and reduced graphene oxide (PW/rGO) were synthesized via a one-step in situ synthesis method with sodium citrate, which was employed both as a chelating agent to control the reaction rate during the coprecipitation process of PW synthesis and as a reducing agent for GO. The low precipitation speed helps minimize lattice defects, while rGO enhances electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the one-step in situ synthesis method is simpler and more efficient than the traditional synthesis method. Compared with pure PW, the PW/rGO composites exhibit significantly improved electrochemical properties. Cycling performance tests indicated that the PW/rGO-10 sample exhibited the highest initial discharge capacity and the best cyclic stability. The PW/rGO-10 has an initial discharge capacity of 128 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C = 170 mA g(-1)), and retains 49.53% capacity retention after 100 cycles, while the PW only delivers 112 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 17.79% after 100 cycles. Moreover, PW/rGO-10 also shows better rate performance and higher sodium ion diffusion coefficient (D-Na(+)) than the PW sample. Therefore, the incorporation of rGO not only enhances the electrical conductivity but also promotes the rapid diffusion of sodium ions, effectively improving the electrochemical performance of the composite as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.

   Electrocatalyst as an Oxygen Electrode in a Water Electrolyzer
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The oxygen electrode plays a vital role in the successful commercialization of renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells and water electrolyzers. In this study, the Prussian blue analogue-derived nitrogen-doped nanocarbon (NC) layer-trapped, cobalt-rich, core-shell nanostructured electrocatalysts (core-shell Co@NC) are reported. The electrode exhibits an improved oxygen evolution activity and stability compared to that of the commercial noble electrodes. The core-shell Co@ NC-loaded nickel foam exhibits a lower overpotential of 330 mV than that of IrO2 on nickel foam at 10 mA cm(-2) and has a durability of over 400 h. The commercial Pt/C cathode-assisted, core-shell Co@ NC-anode water electrolyzer delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.59 V, which is 70 mV lower than that of the IrO2-anode water electrolyzer. Over the long-term chronopotentiometry durability testing, the IrO2-anode water electrolyzer shows a cell voltage loss of 230 mV (14%) at 95 h, but the loss of the core-shell Co@ NC-anode electrolyzer is only 60 mV (4%) even after 350 h cell-operation. The findings indicate that the Prussian blue analogue is a class of inorganic nanoporous materials that can be used to derive metal-rich, core-shell electrocatalysts with enriched active centers.

AB A successful solar energy storage is accomplished in a 5 V/5 mAh rated Na-ion battery, which is customized by series connection of three 1.8 V unit cells. The unit cell is constructed with open framework structured Na2Co0.5Ni0.5Fe(CN)(6) positive and Natrium Super Ionic CONductor (NaSICON) type NaTi2(PO4)(3) negative electrodes in 1 M Na2SO4-SiO2 hydrogel electrolyte. Both positive and negative active materials demonstrate Faradaic charge storage mechanism with appreciable diffusion coefficients, such as 5.17 x 10(-15 )and 1.13 x 10(-15), respectively. The Na2Co0.5Ni0.5Fe(CN)(6)//NaTi2(PO4)(3) full cell depicts a specific capacity of 48 mAh g(-1) (@ 100 mA g(-1)), an energy density of 95.68 Wh kg(-1) (@ 259.96 W kg(-1)) and a power density of 779.75 W kg(-1) (@ 54.36 Wh kg(-1)). The cell also exhibits an excellent durability, i.e., 93% capacity retention with 99% Columbic efficiency at 200 mA g(-1) upon 1000 cycles. However, the 5 V battery is performance tested under solar-charging cum constant-load-discharging experiment for one-month, and the device describes 85% capacity retention over the period. The good power capability and cycle life with moderate energy density make this battery chemistry suitable for solar energy storage applications.

TI Cobalt hexacyanoferrate enhanced by common ion effect for aqueous
   potassium-ion batteries
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Aqueous potassium-ion batteries (APIBs) are emerging as candidates for large-scale energy storage in virtue of their cost-efficiency, environmental friendliness and intrinsic security. Nevertheless, the shortage of high-capacity and long-cycle K+ hosts imposes restrictions on developing advanced APIBs. Herein, KCo[Fe(CN)(6)] (K-CoHCF) is synthesized through simple co-precipitation and applied as a novel cathode material for storage of K+ in APIBs. For building a strong host, Co(NO3)(2) is introduced into the electrolyte to suppress the dissolution of Co ions and consolidate the lattice structure on account of "common ion effect". Thus, benefitting from its firm open structure as well as two active redox couples, K-CoHCF exhibits desirable capacity of 89.2 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), excellent rate performance and superior cycling stability with 87.0% capacity retention upon 1400 cycles. In addition, the highly reversible structural evolution and single-phase reaction mechanism of K-CoHCF are unraveled by a series of ex-situ tests during K+ insertion/extraction. Thus, this work establishes a feasible battery system with K-CoHCF as cathode and sheds light on further development of advanced APIBs for practical utilization.

SO FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Emerging sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) devices hold the promise to leapfrog over existing lithium-ion batteries technologies with respect to desirable power/energy densities and the abundant sodium sources on the earth. To this end, the discoveries on novel cathode materials with outstanding rate capabilities are being given high priority in the quest to achieve high power density SIBs devices, and the multi-dimensional Na+ migration pathways with low diffusion energy barriers are crucial. In light of this, the recent development of Prussian blue analogs and sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type materials with 3D Na+ diffusion pathways for building high power density NIBs are provided in this perspective. Ultimately, the future research directions to realize them for real applications are also discussed.

TI Facile synthesis and cycling performance maintenance of iron
   hexacyanoferrate cathode for sodium-ion battery
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB In this work, sodium-rich iron hexacyanoferrate Na1.74Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.90.2.07H2O (NaFeHCF) with a cubic structure is firstly prepared via a bottom-up approach. The electrochemical reaction mechanism and cycling performance maintenance of as-prepared NaFeHCF are carefully investigated. It is found that there exists some irreversible transformation of sodium positions in iron hexacyanoferrate during electrochemical cycling. Due to the highly itinerant electron state between high spin FeHS and low spin FeLS during redox reaction, the electron transfer in the FeLS3+/FeLS2+ at above 4 V gradually shift to that in the FeHS3+/FeHS2+ at about 3.35 V. However, such a dynamic transformation is not favorable for cycling stability, as more sodium content left in the 24d positions of cubic structure helps stabilize the framework and alleviate the capacity fading. The effects of the cutoff potential, the activated rate at 1st cycle, and the temperature are carefully investigated to find an operating window with insignificant transformation, where the sodium-rich iron hexacyanoferrate presents high cycling stability at 25 degrees C (with a capacity retention of 84.1% for 500 cycles at the current density of 600 mAg-1).

SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Point-of-care diagnostics (POC), often known as on-site testing has evolved as a quick and accurate methodology for analyzing and therapeutic monitoring of drugs. The aim of this study is to provide cost-effective, simple, portable, reliable, and ecofriendly methodology for determination of Tinidazole (TD); potentiometric sensors are found to be an ideal fit for achieving these goals. An advanced microfabricated ion selective electrode is provided employing two-steps procedure. The first is selecting the most selective ionophore for TD determination while the second is to improve the stability and detection limit upon doping the nanoparticles as ion to electron transducer layer between the microfabricated copper electrode and the ion selective media as it can decrease potential drift from 8.0 to similar to 1.0 mV h-1. Nernstian potentiometric results were obtained for TD in range of concentration 1.0 x 10-3 to 1.0 x 10-8 M, its slope was -57.43 mV/decade with lower detection limits 2.55 x 10-9 M. Essential values of the adopted sensor are fast and stable response time (9 +/- 2 s). The provided potentiometric approach succeeds to asses TD in its pure and pharmaceutical forms, furthermore in different biological fluids with satisfactory results.

TI Concave Ni(OH)2 Nanocube Synthesis and Its Application in

SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The controlled synthesis of hollow structure transition metal compounds has long been a very interesting and significant research topic in the energy storage and conversion fields. Herein, an ultrasound-assisted chemical etching strategy is proposed for fabricating concave Ni(OH)(2) nanocubes. The morphology and composition evolution of the concave Ni(OH)(2) nanocubes suggest a possible formation mechanism. The as-synthesized Ni(OH)(2) nanostructures used as supercapacitor electrode materials exhibit high specific capacitance (1624 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)) and excellent cycling stability (77% retention after 4000 cycles) due to their large specific surface area and open pathway. In addition, the corresponding hybrid capacitor (Ni(OH)(2)//graphene) demonstrates high energy density (42.9 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1)) and long cycle life (78% retention after 4000 cycles at 5 A g(-1)). This work offers a simple and economic approach for obtaining concave Ni(OH)(2) nanocubes for energy storage and conversion.

SO MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have recently attracted extensive interests as a new class of cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. Copper hexacyanoferrate, a typical Prussian blue analogue with the chemical formula Cu-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), has been synthesized by solution precipitation method and investigated as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. The galvanostatic cycling tests show a specific capacity of 44 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 20 mA g(-1) and the capacity retention can be 57.1% after 50 cycles, The material can also deliver a specific capacity of 37 mA h g(-1) and 25 mA h g(-1) at a rate of 50 mA g(-1) and 100 mA g(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the material exhibits a high reduction peak at 3.32 V vs. Na+/Na, which brings more power to sodium-ion batteries. The data indicate the as-prepared material is capable of realizing the single electron redox capacity due to the reduction of Fe3+/Fe2+. All of the findings suggest a possible use of Cu-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) nanoparticles as environmental friendly and cost-effective cathode material, which also open new perspectives to develop cathode materials for sodium-ion batteris.

TI Challenges and Prospects of Sodium-Ion and Potassium-Ion Batteries for
   Mass Production
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The exponential growth of the lithium-ion (LIB) market is causing a significant disparity between the supply chain and demand for its resources. In this regard, sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries are promising alternatives to LIBs due to their low cost. However, the larger sizes of Na+ and K+ ions create challenges that prevent them from achieving energy densities comparable to LIBs while maintaining an acceptable cycle life. In this perspective, the aim is to evaluate the status of Na-ion and K-ion batteries and the challenges associated with them on both fundamental and commercial levels. The focus is on the structural instability arising from phase transitions during cycling, intricate chemical degradation processes, and potential avenues for enhancing their performance with a specific goal of improving their viability for grid-scale energy storage. Materials production and abundance limitations for the chemistries of the state-of-the-art materials and account for critical parameters from both the perspective of researchers and investors are analyzed. This analysis aims to provide insights into the strategic trade-offs required to effectively implement the technology in real-world applications, such as grid-scale storage and other areas. Furthermore, the utilization of metals with low or no supply-chain problems as an important aspect of these trade-offs is considered.
   The challenges that must be overcome for the ubiquitous adoption of sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries are discussed, with grid-scale energy storage in mind, including structural and interfacial stability of cathodes, electrolyte stability window, and cost-effectiveness in producing the materials at the necessary scale.image

TI Ultrafine Core-Shell Nanostructured Iron Cobalt Ferrocyanide with
   Excellent Electrocatalytic Activity toward Overall Water Splitting
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB The development and production of non-noble metal electrocatalysts with exceptional activity and stability for water electrolysis was essential for energy conversion and storage. An optimized working electrode of core-shell nanosphere Fe2Co8HCF on nickel foam exhibits a small overpotential of 241 mV (63 mV/dec) for OER and 158 mV (92 mV/dec) for HER at 10 mA/cm(2) (without iR correction) in 1.0 M KOH. Fe2Co8HCF shows ultra-stability (150 h) with loss of 2.9 % and 3.1 % for OER and HER, respectively. The interaction between Fe, Co and HCF that resulted in the formation of core-shell nanostructure was highly beneficial for reaction kinetics. The active bifunctional Fe2Co8HCF/NF electrode pair aids in the development of a water electrolyzer that provides 10 mA/cm(2) at 1.63 V. The Fe2Co8HCF/NF//Fe2Co8HCF/NF displays great durability (over 150 h) with loss of 4.2 %. The solar-driven water electrolysis at 1.63 V demonstrates the enhanced efficiency of an optimized electrocatalyst. These results imply that Fe2Co8HCF/NF//Fe2Co8HCF/NF can be utilized to generate a huge amount of hydrogen at low cost.

TI Nickel-Substituted Copper Hexacyanoferrate as a Superior Cathode for
   Aqueous Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Copper-based hexacyanoferrates have received important interest as cathode candidates for aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), owing to the room-temperature synthesis route, fast reaction kinetics, and high working potential. However, they suffer from insufficient cycling performance in medium aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a nickel-substituted copper hexacyanoferrate (Na2Cu0.6Ni0.4[Fe(CN)(6)]) is reported as a superior cathode for aqueous SIBs, which is developed by studying the effect of Ni substitution on the electrochemical properties of Na2Cu1-xNix[Fe(CN)(6)] (0x1) series. It exhibits a reversible capacity of 62mAhg(-1) and an average working potential of 0.62V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a current rate of 0.5 C. Even though being cycled at a high current rate of 10 C, it can achieve a discharge capacity of 56mAhg(-1) and render a capacity retention of 96% after 1000 cycles. Relative to most previously reported cathode materials, the material shows superior overall performance including improved specific energy, outstanding high-rate capability, and excellent cycling performance. This indicates that Na2Cu0.6Ni0.4[Fe(CN)(6)] is a promising cathode candidate for aqueous SIBs.

TI A battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage device that directly uses
   seawater or saltwater lake water
SO MATERIALS TODAY ADVANCES
AB Rechargeable seawater batteries (RSWBs) are highly attractive for grid storages, because seawater is free of charge, eco-friendly, and sustainable. A common route to achieve a balanced comprehensive performance for electrochemical energy storages is to combine the battery-supercapacitor behaviors, which has not been tried for RSWBs. Herein, we propose a seawater battery-supercapacitor hybrid device, which is constructed by a pseudocapacitive amorphous MoOx anode and an intercalation-type Prussian blue analogue cathode, to achieve high overall performances. Both the anode and cathode demonstrate high specific capacities, excellent rate performances, and high reversibility, due to pseudocapacitive characteristic of the anode and the open framework crystallographic structure of the cathode. The hybrid device displays a high specific energy of 41.2 Wh/kg at a high specific power of 519 W/kg and a high energy efficiency up to 76.8 %. By using directly salt- lake water (Qinghai Lake and Yuncheng Salt Lake) as electrolyte, the hybrid device also displays excellent electrochemical performances. This work provides a new avenue for developing high-performance sustainable energy storage devices.

TI Vacancy-PBA derived nanoparticle containing defect-rich crystal
   structure and P, S dual-doping as an outstanding oxygen evolution
   electrocatalyst
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Herein, a uniquely-designed electrocatalyst containing a defect-rich crystal structure and P, S dual dopant (designated v-NiFe-PS) is synthesized for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The [Fe(CN)6] vacancy-PBA (v-PBA) precursor is simply synthesized via mixing and post-oxidation. The defect-rich crystal structure is provided by the v-PBA precursor, and the P, S dual doping provides a tailored electronic distribution around the metal active sites, thereby reducing the energy barrier for the OER. This is confirmed by comparison of the v-NiFe-PS with single-doped v-NiFe-P and v-NiFe-S, and with NiFe-PS derived from non-vacancy PBA. As a result, the v-NiFe-PS exhibits the lowest overpotential (263 mV) and Tafel slope (41 mA dec-1) com-pared to the comparison groups and the benchmark (RuO2). Furthermore, the v-NiFe-PS exhibits a robust stability during 100 charge/discharge cycles, and a low voltage gap of 0.93 V at 1.0 mA cm-2.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Reduced Graphene Oxide/Ruthenium Oxide Hexacyanoferrate Nanocomposite
   for Electrochemical Determination of Ethanol in Commercial Samples
SO JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Reduced graphene oxide/ruthenium oxide hexacyanoferrate (rGO/RuOHCF) modified electrode showed synergic activity between the materials attested by the increase of electrochemical current and stability. The preparation of the nanocomposite was made by a simple two-step electrochemical approach. The material structure was characterized by spectroscopic techniques (Raman, infrared and energy-dispersive X-ray) as well as its morphology by scanning electron microscopy and compared to the analogously prepared reduced graphene oxide ( rGO) and ruthenium oxide hexacyanoferrate (RuOHCF) thin films spectra and images. The results suggest that the improvement of the nanocomposite electrochemical activity is generated by the well-distributed RuOHCF nanometric particles over high-surfaced graphene sheets. Ethanol electrochemical oxidation in the rGO/RuOHCF modified electrode was performed in 0.1 mol L-1 NaCl (pH = 1.5) solution and it showed an anodic current peak starting at 0.9 V.Scan rate tests exhibited a diffusioncontrolled process not followed by any coupled chemical reaction. The determination of ethanol by amperometry coupled with batch injection analysis (BIA) system resulted in a wide linear range (20-400 mmol L-1) and good sensitivity (0.150 mu A L mmol(-1)). The nanocomposite also showed application as an electrochemical sensor of ethanol in commercial samples mainly because of its easy preparation comparing to biosensors.

TI Investigating the role of interstitial water molecules in copper
   hexacyanoferrate for sodium-ion battery cathodes
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium (Na)-ion batteries owing to their large channel size and stability in aqueous and organic electrolytes. However, the impact of interstitial water molecules within PBA channels has not yet been adequately investigated. Herein, by comparing the electrochemical performance of PBAs in aqueous and organic electrolytes, we demonstrate that water molecules depending on their number can inhibit the insertion of hydrated Na+ ions. As a result, CuHCFe-1.4H(2)O with fewer interstitial water molecules possesses a higher specific capacity in an aqueous electrolyte compared to CuHCFe-1.8H(2)O, which has a higher number of interstitial water molecules. In addition, we found that interstitial water molecules can obstruct Na+ ion diffusion, leading to poor kinetic properties. We believe that the newly found roles of interstitial water molecules could shed light on the design of high-performance PBAs for Na+-ion battery cathodes.

TI P-doped Co3S4/NiS2 heterostructures
   embedded in N-doped carbon nanoboxes: Synergistical electronic structure
   regulation for overall water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Water splitting using transition metal sulfides as electrocatalysts has gained considerable attention in the field of renewable energy. However, their electrocatalytic activity is often hindered by unfavorable free energies of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates. Herein, phosphorus (P)-doped Co3S4/NiS2 hetero-structures embedded in N-doped carbon nanoboxes were rationally synthesized via a pyrolysis-sulfidation-phosphorization strategy. The hollow structure of the carbon matrix and the nanoparticles contained within it not only result in a high specific surface area, but also protects them from corrosion and acts as a conductive pathway for efficient electron transfer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the intro-duction of P dopants improves the conductivity of NiS2 and Co3S4, promotes the charge transfer process, and creates new electrocatalytic sites. Additionally, the NiS2-Co3S4 heterojunctions can enhance the adsorption efficiency of hydrogen intermediates (H*) and lower the energy barrier of water splitting via a synergistic effect with P-doping. These characteristics collectively enable the titled catalyst to exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for water splitting in alkaline medium, requiring only small overpotentials of 150 and 257 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. This work sheds light on the design and optimization of efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting, with potential implications for renewable energy production.

TI A novel hollow CuMn-PBA@NiCo-LDH nanobox for efficient detection of
   glucose in food
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB Designing a rapid and sensitive glucose detection method is of great significance to public health. Herein, hollow CuMn-PBA@NiCo-LDH nanoboxes (CuMn-PBA@NiCo-LDH NBs) were prepared using acid etching, cation ex-change, and reflux method. The modified electrode exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance for glucose oxidation due to the unique hollow nanostructure and synergistic effects. The CuMn-PBA@NiCo-LDH NBs electrode displayed excellent electrocatalytic oxidation activity for glucose in an alkaline solution. Under optimal conditions, the electrode achieved a wide linear range (0.0005-1 mmol L-1, and 1-7 mmol L-1) and high sensitivity (10,300 mu A L/mmol cm-2 and 5310 mu A L/mmol cm-2), with a limit of detection (LOD) of 19 nmol L-1. The feasibility of the sensor applied to the detection of glucose was verified in real food samples through spiked recovery experiments. This electrode material offers an alternative method for the non-enzymatic glucose sensors.

TI Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Electrodes for Continuous Cation Intercalation
   Desalination of Brackish Water
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Using porous electrodes containing redox-active nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) nanoparticles, we construct and test a device for capacitive deionization in a two flow-channel device where the intercalation electrodes are in direct contact with an anion-exchange membrane. Upon reduction of NiHCF, cations intercalate into it and the water in its vicinity is desalinated; at the same time water in the opposing electrode becomes more saline upon oxidation of NiHCF in that electrode. In a cyclic process of charge and discharge, fresh water is continuously produced, alternating between the two channels in sync with the direction of applied current. We present proof-of-principle experiments of this technology for single salt solutions, where we analyze various levels of current and cycle durations. We analyze salt removal rate and energy consumption. In desalination experiments with salt mixtures we find a threefold enhancement for K+ over Na+-adsorption, which shows the potential of NiHCF intercalation electrodes for selective ion separation from mixed ionic solutions.

TI Porous Two-dimensional Iron-Cyano Nanosheets for High-rate
   Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction
SO ACS NANO
AB Ammonia (NH3) is an essential ingredient in agriculture and a promising source of clean energy as a hydrogen carrier. The current major method for ammonia production, however, is the Haber-Bosch process that leads to massive energy consumption and severe environmental issues. Compared with nitrogen (N-2) reduction, electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), with a higher NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency, holds promise for efficient NH3 production under ambient conditions. To achieve efficient NO3RR, electrocatalysts should exhibit high selectivity and Faradaic efficiency with a high NH3 yield rate. In this work, we developed twodimensional (2D) iron-based cyano-coordination polymer nanosheets (Fe-cyano NSs) following in situ electrochemical treatment for high-rate NO3RR. Owing to the strong adsorption of nitrate on Fe-0 active sites generated via topotactic conversion and in situ electroreduction, 2D Fe-cyano electrocatalyst exhibits high catalytic activity with a yield rate of 42.1 mg h- 1 mgcat(-1) and a Faradaic efficiency of over 90% toward NH3 production at -0.5 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Further electrochemical characterizations revealed that superhydrophilic surface and enhanced electrochemical surface area of the 2D porous nanostructures also contributed to the high-rate NO3RR activity. An electrolyzer toward NO3RR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a two-electrode configuration is constructed based on 2D Fe-cyano, achieving an energy efficiency of 26.2%. This work provides an alternative methodology toward topotactic conversion of transition metal nanosheets for NO3RR and reveals the often-overlooked contribution of hydrophilicity of the catalysts for high-rate electrocatalysis.

SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The growth of renewable energy generation has necessitated electric energy storage (EES) systems. Batteries are the most promising small-scale EES system, given their portability, quick response time, and high compatibility with electrical devices. We present a thermally assisted K/Zn ion hybrid battery for high roundtrip efficiency. The battery contains a copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCFe) cathode and a zinc metal anode with a discharging voltage of 1.75 V in a K/Zn ion hybrid aqueous electrolyte. The battery's roundtrip efficiency improved by 2.1-4.5% when cycled between 10 and 30 degrees C. Its discharging voltage and temperature coefficient improved dramatically when the K ion was replaced with a Rb ion. The proposed thermally assisted battery cycle can be used with various conventional batteries to reduce EES energy loss during charge/discharge cycles.

SO TRENDS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Potassium-ion batteries have recently attracted considerable attention as cost-effective alternatives to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage. However, a major obstacle to the practical application of this emerging technology is the lack of suitable cathode materials that are capable of delivering high gravimetric/volumetric energy, stable cycle life, and high rate capability. In this review article, we review the recent progress in cathodes development for potassium-ion batteries. These materials are categorized into four types: layered oxides, Prussian blue analogs, poly-anion, and organic compounds. Based on our critical review of the reported literature, we identify poly-anion compounds as a class of promising candidates among all types and provide suggestions for future optimization.

TI Potassium barium hexacyanoferrate - A potential cathode material for
   rechargeable calcium ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Potassium barium hexacyanoferrate (K2BaFe(CN)(6)) was investigated as a cathode material for reversible Ca2+ ion insertion/extraction type rechargeable battery using non-aqueous electrolytes. The electrochemical performance of K2BaFe(CN)(6)was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and galvanic cycling at ambient temperature. It is shown that addition of water led to significant enhancement in intercalation and de-intercalation of Ca2+ ions, leading to improved charge/ discharge capacity. The enhancement in performance is attributed to formation of solvation spheres around the intercalating Ca2+ ions which provide screening from the electrostatic charges of the BaFe(CN)(6) lattice. A reversible capacity of 55.8 mA hr g(-1) and a coulombic efficiency of 93.8% was demonstrated at the end of 30 charge/discharge cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB A series of nickel-zinc hexacyanoferrate (NixZnyHCF) was synthesized through a conventional co-precipitation method, and their potassium-ion storage performances were tested in a 30% KOH solution. Among these samples, Ni3Zn1HCF obtained the highest capacity (96.7 mA h g(-1)). After introducing the chelating agent in the synthetic procedure, the obtained Ni3Zn1HCF-10 sample displayed high crystallinity with reduced crystal water and improved cyclic stability (99.0% capacity retention after 350 cycles) over the sample prepared without involving the chelating agent (56.2% capacity retention after 250 cycles). Finally, a K+/H+ hybrid-ion aqueous alkaline battery was built with a Ni3Zn1HCF-10 cathode and an active carbon anode. The constructed full cell delivered a capacity of 44.8 mA h g(-1) at a 1.6 V operational voltage. Further, it had excellent rate capability and low self-discharge along with good stability (99.6% capacity retention after 500 cycles). This study provides a great strategy for fabricating efficient rechargeable aqueous alkaline batteries.

TI Vanadium Hexacyanoferrate Derived V-Fe-K Mixed Oxides as Anode Materials
   for Lithium-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB A new facile solvothermal method has been designed to fabricate a cyanide-metal framework compound of vanadium hexacyanoferrate@rGO, which was then thermally converted into a three-dimensional cubic structure of C/Fe2O3/K3V5O14. In this work, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) provides strength via a rich network structure for particles, enabling changes to the microstructure after calcination. The beneficial features of this nanostructure enhance its structural integrity to limit structural collapse during Li+ insertion/extraction. This has allowed the electrochemical performance of the C/Fe2O3/K3V5O14 electrode to be significantly improved. The electrode shows a reversible capacity of 322.6 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 500 mA g(-1) and high, unprecedented rate capabilities, delivering average capacities of 570, 456, and 343 mAh g(-1) at 100, 200, and 500 mA g(-1), respectively. These results indicate that these newly developed compounds can be promising anode materials for high-performance LIBs.

TI Uniform manganese hexacyanoferrate hydrate nanocubes featuring superior
   performance for low-cost supercapacitors and nonenzymatic
   electrochemical sensors
SO NANOSCALE
AB Uniform manganese hexacyanoferrate hydrate nanocubes are prepared via a simple chemical precipitation method at room temperature. Due to both micro/mesopores of the Prussian blue analogue and nanocubic structures, the manganese hexacyanoferrate hydrate nanocubes allow the efficient charge transfer and mass transport for electrolyte solution and chemical species. Thus, the manganese hexacyanoferrate hydrate nanocube electrode shows a good rate capability and cycling stability for electrochemical capacitors. Furthermore, electrodes modified with manganese hexacyanoferrate hydrate nanocubes demonstrate a sensitive electrochemical response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in buffer solutions with a high selectivity.

TI Effects of Lattice Misfit on the Growth of Coordination Polymer
   Heterostructures
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB The heterogeneous growth of a series of Prussian blue analogues on nickel hexacyanocobaltate seeds to produce coordination polymer heterostructues was investigated to determine the influence of lattice misfit over the growth mode. For small lattice misfits, the observation of a core-shell morphology indicates the growth of a pseudomorphic layer while larger lattice misfits result in the growth of islands. A structural study suggests an efficient mechanical coupling of the substrate and overlayer materials. The difference in lattice constants between the heterostructure components induces anisotropic strain that is relieved by switching to a different growth mode.

TI Boosting oxygen evolution reaction activity and durability of phosphate
   doped Ni(OH)2/FeOOH hierarchical microtubes by morphology
   engineering and reconstruction strategy
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Developing electrocatalysts with remarkable activity and durability is significant for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we designed phosphate doped Ni(OH)2/FeOOH hierarchical microtubes (denoted as POx-Ni(OH)2/FeOOH HMTs), obtained by phosphate doped NiFe Prussian blue analogue hierarchical microtubes (denoted as P-NF-PBA HMTs) completely reconstructing in OER process. POxNi(OH)2/FeOOH HMTs possess an extremely low overpotential of 237 mV at 30 mA cm-2 in alkaline electrolyte with the Tafel slope of 35 mV dec-1, and the catalysts can maintain excellent durability for 100 h at 30 mA cm-2. The remarkable electrochemical catalytic activity comes from the advantages of the hierarchical hollow structure, the modulation of electronic structure caused by phosphate doping, and the synergistic effect of Ni(OH)2 and FeOOH species produced by catalyst complete reconstruction in the OER process. This work may provide an effective strategy to develop highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts towards OER.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Novel Cerium Hexacyanoferrate(II) as Cathode Material for Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Owing to the demand for large-scale energy storage applications and the Li resource shortage, over the past few decades, various novel materials have been investigated as Li+-ion hosts. However, very few candidates have been found as Na+/K+-ion host due to their much larger ionic radius than that of Li+-ion. Herein, a cerium hexacyanoferrate (CeHCF) has been successfully synthesized by a facile coprecipitation method for Li+/Na+/K+-ion storage. As a cathode material, CeHCF delivers a specific capacity of similar to 60 mAh/g at 0.25 C and similar to 80% capacity retention at 8.3 C in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and similar to 55 mAh/g at 0.25 C with similar to 55% capacity retention at 8.3 C in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), respectively. Owing to its open 3D framework and highly stable crystal structure, CeHCF presents as a "zero-strain" insertion cathode material for a reversible insertion/extraction of Li+/Na+/K+-ion. Through multiple characterization techniques, including in situ XRD and ex situ Raman, alkali ion intercalation of CeHCF has been investigated. Our studies not only deliver a novel candidate as a universal host for alkali ion but also deduce the alkali ion storage mechanism in the framework and the structure evolution in the electrochemical process.

Here, the potassium cobalt hexacyanoferrate (K2CoFe(CN)(6)) with a nanocubic assembled structure was successfully synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method and low-temperature calcination operation; this material is employed as the working electrode for aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AIBs).

SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB In this work, a highly efficient multifunctional non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor is successfully fabricated based on a facile two-step synthetic strategy. It resolves two important challenges of poor stability and low reproducibility compared to conventional electrochemical enzyme -based sensors. Herein, a metal-organic framework (UiO-66) is selected as a sacrificial template to construct the corresponding Prussian blue analogue (PBA) target to improve its stability and conductivity, namely, PBA/UiO-66/NF. Target PBA/UiO-66/NF exhibits excellent electrochemical sensing performance as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and glucose sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity of up to 1903 mu A mM-1 cm-2 for H2O2 and 22,800 mu A mM-1 cm-2 for glucose, as well as a very low detection limit of 0.02 mu M (S/ N = 3) for H2O2 and 0.28 mu M for glucose. Especially, extremely high stability can be observed, which will be beneficial for practical application.

AB Because of the high safety and environmental friendliness,aqueouszinc-ion batteries have gained a lot of attention in recent years.Prussian blue and its analogues are regarded as a promising cathodematerial of zinc-ion batteries. Manganese hexacyanoferrate is appropriateamong them due to its high operating voltage, large capacity, andcheap price. However, the poor cycling stability of manganese hexacyanoferrate,mainly caused by transition metal dissolution, side reaction, andphase transition, greatly restricts its practical application. Inthis work, gelatin is used to limit the content of free water in theelectrolyte, thus reducing the dissolution effect of transition metalmanganese. The introduction of gelatin improves the durability ofthe Zn anode as well. The optimized MnHCF/gel-0.3/Zn battery displaysa high reversible capacity (120 mAh center dot g(-1) at0.1 A center dot g(-1)), an excellent rate performance (42.7mAh center dot g(-1) at 2 A center dot g(-1)),and a good capacity retention (65% at 0.5 A center dot g(-1) after 1000 cycles).

TI Application of a conversion electrode based on decomposition derivatives

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The lack of stable electrode materials for water-based electrolytes due to the intercalation and conversion reaction mechanisms encourage scientists to design new or renovate existing materials with better cyclability, capacity, and cost-effectiveness. Ag-4[Fe(CN)(6)] is a material belonging to the Prussian blue family that can be used, as its other family members, as an electrode material with the intercalation/deintercalation reaction or conversion-type mechanism through Ag oxidation/reduction. However, due to the instability of this material in its dry state, it decomposes to AgCN and a Prussian blue residual complex. A possible reason for Ag-4[Fe(CN)(6)] decomposition is discussed. Nevertheless, it is shown that the decomposition products of Ag-4[Fe(CN)(6)] have electrochemical activity due to the reversible oxidation/reduction of Ag atoms in water-based electrolytes.

TI Core-bishell NiFe@NC@MoS2 for boosting electrocatalytic
   activity towards ultra-efficient oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Designing and developing suitable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity and stability remain challenging in electrolytic water splitting. Hence, NiFe@NC@MoS2 core-bishell composites wrapped by molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and nitrogen-doped graphene (NC) were prepared using hydrothermal synthesis in this research. NiFe@NC@MoS2 composite exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 288 mV and a Tafel slope of 53.2 mV center dot dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, which is superior to commercial RuO2. NC and MoS2 bishells create profuse edge active sites that enhance the adsorption ability of OOH* while lowering the overall overpotential of the product and improving its oxygen precipitation performance. The density function theory(DFT) analysis confirms that the layered MoS2 in NiFe@NC@MoS2 provides additional edge active sites and enhances electron transfer, thus increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity. This research paves a novel way for developing OER electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic performance.

TI Vanadium Hexacyanoferrate as a High-Capacity and High-Voltage Cathode
   for Aqueous Rechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are widely used as electrode materials for secondary batteries because of their cheapness, ease of synthesis, and unique structural properties. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory capacity and cyclic stability of PBAs are seriously preventing their practical applications. Here, vanadium hexacyanoferrate (VHCF) is successfully prepared and used as a cathode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). When using 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)(2) as the electrolyte, a high capacity of similar to 230 mA h g(-1) and a high voltage of similar to 1.2 V can be achieved. The XRD result and XPS analysis indicate that the outstanding Zn2+ storage capability is due to the presence of dual electrochemical redox centers in VHCF (Fe2+ reversible arrow Fe3+ and V5+ reversible arrow V4+ reversible arrow V3+). However, the battery shows a short cycle life (7.1% remaining capacity after 1000 cycles) due to the dissolution of VHCF. To elongate the cycle life of the battery, a high-concentration hybrid electrolyte is used to reduce the activity of water molecules. The improved battery exhibits an impressive capacity of 235.8 mA h g(-1) and good capacity retention (92.9%) after 1000 cycles.

TI Fabrication of MoS2-Decorated Nickel-Cobalt Bimetal Phosphide
   Nanocubes as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB Nickel-cobalt bimetal phosphides were prepared via the phosphidation treatment of NiCo-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA). Subsequently, the core-shell structures of NiCoP@MoS2 were successfully assembled through a solvothermal reaction, where the NiCoP substrates were uniformly and randomly covered by MoS2 nanosheets. The resulting hybrids exhibited significantly superior catalytic activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 to bare MoS2. The optimal catalyst afforded the best HER performance with a low overpotential of 138 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 78.1 mV dec(-1), together with high stability and durability. The excellent HER properties of hybrids mainly originated from the unique core-shell architecture and the intrinsic natures of MoS2 and PBA-derived bimetal phosphides.

TI In-situ coupling of N-doped carbon dots with manganese hexacyanoferrate
   as a cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion batteries
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are a competitive class of aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) cathode materials with an ideal three-dimensional open structure for rapid insertion and removal of Zn2+. Meanwhile, PBAs have the advantages of high working voltage and a simple synthesis process. However, these materials are inherently poor in electrical conductivity and are susceptible to structural collapse during cycling. These defects affect the performance of zinc storage in this type of material. Here, the integration of zero-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) and in-situ grown manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) affords the MnHCF/NCDs cathode materials, which are applied to AZIBs. The introduction of NCDs modifies the active component of MnHCF effectively. Meanwhile, NCDs significantly enhance the overall electrical conductivity and structural stability of the composites and also provide abundant active sites for electrochemical reactions. Benefiting from these merits, the MnHCF/NCDs composite exhibits an excellent electrochemical zinc storage performance. It has a high discharge-specific capacity of 131.2 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and has outstanding cycling stability of 91% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The electrochemical performance of PBAs-based cathodes for AZIBs may be improved using the straightforward and efficient method presented in this work.

TI Nanosized nickel hexacyanoferrate modified screen-printed electrodes as
   flexible supercabattery platforms: Influence of annealing temperatures
   and supporting electrolytes
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Water-insoluble nickel hexacyanoferrate Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2).nH(2)O (NiHCF) nanoparticles were synthesized via a facile precipitation method in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and sodium citrate (SC). Large-scale production of cubic NiHCF crystals with an average diameter of 35 nm and a specific surface area (SBET) of 452.9 m(2)/g was shown to be possible. The NiHCF nanoparticles were drop-cast upon screen-printed graphite macroelectrode surfaces (SPEs) allowing a flexible energy storage device to be realised. The tunable pore size and dual functional reactive sites offered superior specific capacitances of 197.5, 139.35, 356.25, and 406.25 F/g in 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M KOH, respectively at a current density of 5 A/g. The highest capacitance was found using 0.1 M KOH supporting electrolyte due to the combination of surface (intercalation/de-intercalation of A(+)) and faradaic processes (M2+/M3+) as supercabattery platforms. The thermal treatment of the NiHCF samples at 100, 200, 300 degrees C were performed within oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres and the specific capacitances were measured in 0.1 M KOH. Interestingly, the specific capacitance increases up to 546 F/g for NiHCF annealed at 100 degrees C in oxygen and reduces to 342 F/g if NiHCF when annealed at 200 degrees C in nitrogen atmospheres due to the likely introduction of diverse vacancies. Furthermore, the NiHCF/SPEs were investigated in an as-symmetric two-electrode system, which revealed a specific capacitance of 570 F/g at 5 A/g. The NiHCF/SPE exhibited high capability rate, capacitive retention and excellent cycling stabilities particularly if NiHCF was annealed within a nitrogen atmosphere. Thus, the NiHCF supercabattery platforms can be used for developing new flexible energy storage devices.

TI Advancements and Challenges in Potassium Ion Batteries: A Comprehensive
   Review
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Demand for energy in day to day life is increasing exponentially. However, existing energy storage technologies like lithium ion batteries cannot stand alone to fulfill future needs. In this regard, potassium ion batteries (KIBs) that utilize K ions in their charge storage mechanism have attracted considerable attention due to their unique properties and are therefore established as one of the future battery systems of interest among the scientific community. Nevertheless, the development and identification of appropriate electrode materials is very essential for practical applications. This review features the current development in KIBs electrode and electrolyte materials, the present challenges facing this technology (in the commercial aspect), and future aspects to develop fully functional KIBs. The potassium storage mechanisms, evolution of the KIBs, and the advantages and disadvantages of each category of materials are included. Additionally, various approaches to enhance the electrochemical performances of KIBs are also discussed. This review is not only an amalgamation of different viewpoints in literature, but also contains concise perspectives and strategies. Moreover, the potential emergence of a novel class of K-based dual ion batteries is also analyzed for the first time.

TI A non-enzymatic electrochemical biosensor based on
   Au@PBA(Ni-Fe):MoS2 nanocubes for stable and sensitive
   detection of hydrogen peroxide released from living cells
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the main product of enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in biological processes. The detection of H2O2 inside organisms or cells is critical. Here, we report a nickel-iron Prussian blue analogue nanocube doped with molybdenum disulfide and Au nanoparticles (Au@PBA(Ni-Fe):MoS2) as an electrochemical sensing material for the stable detection of H2O2 in neutral solutions for a long time. First, the Prussian blue analogue (PBA(Ni-Fe)) is synthesized by a simple charge-assembly technology, and then etched into PBA(Ni-Fe):MoS2 hollow nanocubes by a high-temperature hydrothermal reaction. Finally, Au nanoparticles are reduced inside the PBA(Ni-Fe):MoS(2)in situ to generate Au@PBA(Ni-Fe):MoS2 nanocubes. Ni-doping enhances the nanocube's stability in neutral solutions; as a result, the sensor can maintain a stable current response towards H2O2 reduction for more than 1 h. The sensing material can meet the needs of a long-time test. The introduction of Au enhances the electron transfer efficiency, which endows the sensor with good reduction ability for H2O2 at 0 V over a wide linear range (0.5-200 mu M and 210-3000 mu M) and with a low detection limit (0.23 mu M (S/N = 3)), which fulfills the requirements for the detection of H2O2 in a biological system. The sensor can sense H2O2 released from cells stimulated by ascorbic acid. Au@PBA(Ni-Fe):MoS2 provides good guidance for the future development of efficient biosensors to be applied in cell biology.

TI Thermal power generation during heat cycle near room temperature
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate that a sodium-ion secondary battery (SIB)-type thermocell consisting of two types of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with different electrochemical thermoelectric coefficients (S-EC equivalent to partial derivative V/partial derivative T; V and T are the redox potential and temperature, respectively) produces electrical energy during heat cycles. The device produces an electrical energy of 2.3 meV/PBA per heat cycle between 295 K (=T-L) and 323K (=T-H). The ideal thermal efficiency (eta = 1.0%), which is evaluated using the heat capacity (C = 4.16 meV/K) of ideal Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)], reaches 11% of the Carnot efficiency (eta(th) = 8.7%).

TI Water-in-Salt Gel Biopolymer Electrolytes for Flexible and Wearable
   Zn/Alkali Metal Dual-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Zn/alkali metal dual-ion batteries (ZM DIBs) with highly concentrated water-in-salt (WiS) electrolytes are promising next-generation energy storage systems. This enhanced design of Zn-ion rechargeable batteries offers intrinsic safety, high operating voltage, satisfactory capacity, and outstanding cyclic stability. Herein, taking the concept of highly concentrated electrolytes one step further, we introduce water-in-salt gel biopolymer electrolytes (WiS-GBEs) by encapsulating Zn/Li or Zn/Na bisalt compositions in a cellulose membrane. WiS-GBEs inherit the electrochemical merits of highly concentrated electrolytes (i.e., wide voltage window, high ionic conductivity, etc.) and excellent durability of gel biopolymer structures. Both types of WiS-GBEs apply to coin- and pouch-cell compartments of ZM DIBs, offering a high plateau voltage (>1.8 V vs. Zn2+/Zn), good and reversible capacity (118 and 57 mAh g(-1) for Zn/Li and Zn/Na cells, respectively), and outstanding cycling stability (more than 90% after 1,000 cycles). Essentially, the pouch cells with WiS-GBEs present superior durability, flexibility, and capacity endurance under various bending stress conditions (90% capacity retention under 0-180 degrees bending modes), indicating their potential capability to power wearable electronics. The practical powering ability of Li- and Na-based pouch systems is demonstrated by the example of a wearable digital timer.

TI Jadeite original stone inspired PBA core-shell architecture endowed
   fire-safe and mechanic-robust EP composites with low toxicity
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Epoxy resin (EP) has been favored in extensive fields. Nevertheless, the notorious issue of high fire hazard has been a nonnegligible bottleneck for its extended application. Here, a Jadeite original stone inspired PBA coreshell architecture (Co-Fe-Co PBA) is constructed towards fire retardation and toxicity elimination of EP. This architecture holds high strengths in physically blocking and chemically catalyzing towards released volatiles, leading to markedly impaired fire hazard. By using 2.0 wt% Co-Fe-Co PBA, the peak heat release rate and total heat release values are decreased by 40.2% and 33.8% whilst the peak smoke production rate and total smoke production are reduced by 43.7% and 35.2%. Also, the inhibited emissions of toxic gases including CO, NO and HCN, are discovered. Of note, the promotion in impact strength can be acquired. In brief, this work may be encouraging for the construction of PBA based hierarchical architecture, as cornerstones for fire-safe polymer composites with low toxicity.

TI Isotropic negative thermal expansion and its mechanism in

SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The control of thermal expansion is essential in applications where thermal stability is required from fiber optics coatings, high performance fuel cell cathodes to tooth fillings. Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, although rare, are fundamental for this purpose. This work focuses on studying tetracyanidoborate salt CuB(CN)(4), an interesting cubic-structure material that displays large isotropic NTE. A joint study of synchrotron x-ray diffraction, temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and lattice dynamics calculations was conducted, showing that not only low-frequency optical modes (transverse thermal vibrations of N and C atoms) but also the acoustic modes (the vibrations of Cu atoms as a collective torsion of the neighboring atoms), contribute to NTE. As a result, new insights were gained into the NTE mechanism of CuB(CN)(4) and related framework materials.

TI Development of KPF6/KFSA Binary-Salt Solutions for Long-Life
   and High-Voltage K-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB A series of binary-salt electrolytes of KPF6/KN-(SO2F)(2) (KFSA) in carbonate ester solvents have been developed for high-voltage K-ion batteries by clarifying the effect of salt ratio and different solvents on the physical properties of the electrolyte solutions and electrochemical performance of K-ion batteries. The KPF6/KFSA carbonate ester solutions, such as KPF6/KFSA ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC), exhibit higher ionic conductivity than single-salt KPF6 one, and higher KFSA content results in higher ionic conductivity. The KPF6-rich binarysalt electrolytes with KPF6/KFSA ratios of >= 3 (mol/mol) provide enough oxidation stability and passivation against Al corrosion at 4.6 V over 100 h, ensuring reversible operation of a 4 V class positive electrode, K2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] in half-cell. Graphite negative electrodes exhibit higher Coulombic efficiency and better rate performance in 0.75 mol kg(-1) K(PF6)(0.9) (FSA)(0.1)/EC/DEC and 1 mol kg(-1) K(PF6)(0.75)(FSA)(0.25)/EC/DEC electrolytes than those in the KPF6 one. Surface analysis by hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the decomposition product of N(SO2F)(2)(-) anion contributes to stabilizing solid electrolyte interphase on a graphite electrode. From comparing different solvents of EC/DEC, EC/ethyl methyl carbonate, and EC/propylene carbonate (PC), the K2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] electrode demonstrates the highest Coulombic efficiency in the EC/PC binary electrolyte, while graphite electrodes exhibit no significant difference. Based on the half-cell tests, we successfully achieve the 3.6 V class full cell of graphite vertical bar K(PF6)(0.75)(FSA)(0.23)/EC/PC vertical bar K2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] showing excellent cyclability over 500 cycles, which is far superior to that of the conventional KPF6/EC/DEC electrolyte cell.

Since the electro-chemical properties are closely related to the morphology, the monodisperse copper hexacyanoferrate nano flakes with highly crystalline are synthesized by a glycol-assisted coprecipitation method and a tentative synthetic mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of nanostructures. The structure and electrochemical properties are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FTIR spectra and galvanostatic cycle tests, respectively. Due to the novel architecture of copper hexacyanoferrate, a high electrochemical activity is obtained, resulting a high initial coulombic efficiency of 93%, a capacity retention of 73% at 1 degrees C after 300 cycles and 51 mAh g(-1) is maintained at high rate of 15 degrees C at 25 degrees C.

TI Introducing Ce into the interface of NiCo LDH@PBAs to build multi
   core-shell electrode with superior stability of supercapacitor
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Core -shell electrodes have been used in many fields, however, the poor conductivity caused by the weak interfacial interaction limits the practical application of the composites. Herein, a novel multi core-shell material (NiCo-Ce@PBAs) used as electrode in supercapacitor is prepared using Ce as bridge to connect the core (NiCo LDH) and shell (NiCo PBAs). Benefiting from the gradient orbital coupling of 2p -4f -lc derived from O-Ce-C equivalent to N unit sites in NiCo-Ce@PBAs, the composite shows enhanced covalency and determines to delocalize the electronic expansion in the interaction. Besides, the redox pair of Ce 3+ -Ce 4+ also makes great contribution to expedite the charge transfer as well as enhancing the binding energies of metals in core and shell. Overall, the optimized core-shell electrodes show excellent electrochemical performance with high area -specific capacitance of 1847 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 , which is much higher than that of LDH-based electrodes ever reported. In addition, the electrode is found better cyclic performance than the others (95.7 % even after 10,000 cycles), which is due to the fact that the special 4f empty orbits can store partial electrons, thus decreasing the polarization phenomenon. It also shows great practical application when using commercial activated carbon as cathode. This work illustrates a new strategy to construct core-shell electrodes with strong interfacial interaction as well as revealing the important role of orbital theory in the design of multi core-shell electrodes.

TI Pre-Protonated Vanadium Hexacyanoferrate for High Energy-Power and
   Anti-Freezing Proton Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Proton batteries have been considered as an innovative energy storage technology owing to their high safety and cost-effectiveness. However, the development of fast-charging proton batteries with high energy/power density is greatly limited by feasible material selection. Here, the pre-protonated vanadium hexacyanoferrate (H-VHCF) is developed as a proton cathode material to alleviate the capacity loss of proton-free electrode materials during electrochemical tests. The pre-protonation process realizes fast and long-distance transport of protons by shortening diffusion path and reducing migration barriers. Benefitting from the enhanced hydrogen bonding network combined with dual redox reactions of V and Fe in protonated H-VHCF cathode, a high energy density of 74 Wh kg(-1) at 1.1 kW kg(-1), and a maximum power density of 54 kW kg(-1) at 65 Wh kg(-1) is achieved for the asymmetric proton batteries coupling with MoO3/MXene anode. Proton transport and double oxidation-reduction center are verified by theoretical calculations and ex situ experimental measurements. Considering the anti-freezing availability of proton batteries, 82.5% of its initial capacity is maintained after 10000 cycles under -40 degrees C at 0.5 A g(-1). As a proof-of-concept, flexible device fabricated by optimized electrodes and hydrogel electrolytes can power up a light-emitting diode even under a bent state.

TI Understanding electrochemical and structural properties of copper
   hexacyanoferrate: Application in hydrogen peroxide analysis
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) exhibits great electrocatalytic activity towards H2O2 reduction, making it a suitable electrode material for H2O2 sensors and H2O2-based energy storage devices. In this work, the crystal structures, electronic structures, and electrochemical properties of CuHCF were investigated in detail by both experiments and simulation. Several different samples of CuHCF were synthesized and tested. The effects of Fe oxidation states and the Cu-to-Fe ratios on the electroactivities of CuHCF were evaluated. In-depth voltammetric and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) studies revealed the underlying redox chemistry which contribute to the voltammetric responses of CuHCF. High electroactivity of CuHCF, high cycling stability, and high electrocatalytic activity towards H2O2 reduction were observed for the porous K0.09Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](0.6) center dot 2.56 H2O particles synthesized at room temperature from chemical co-precipitation of CuSO4 and K3Fe(CN)(6) at a 2:1 molar ratio. DFT calculation revealed favorable adsorption of H2O2 on Fe sites. The presence of Cu lowered the local charge on Fe, assisting the adsorption of electron-donating H2O2 molecule on the neighboring Fe atom. The excellent analytical performance of CuHCF towards H2O2 detection was further demonstrated, giving the linear range of 0.0 - 10.0 mM, the sensitivity of 10.6 mu A mM(-1), and the limit of detection (3sB/m) of 0.033 mM.

TI Recent Advances in Sodium-Ion Batteries: Cathode Materials
SO MATERIALS
AB Emerging energy storage systems have received significant attention along with the development of renewable energy, thereby creating a green energy platform for humans. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are commonly used, such as in smartphones, tablets, earphones, and electric vehicles. However, lithium has certain limitations including safety, cost-effectiveness, and environmental issues. Sodium is believed to be an ideal replacement for lithium owing to its infinite abundance, safety, low cost, environmental friendliness, and energy storage behavior similar to that of lithium. Inhered in the achievement in the development of LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have rapidly evolved to be commercialized. Among the cathode, anode, and electrolyte, the cathode remains a significant challenge for achieving a stable, high-rate, and high-capacity device. In this review, recent advances in the development and optimization of cathode materials, including inorganic, organometallic, and organic materials, are discussed for SIBs. In addition, the challenges and strategies for enhancing the stability and performance of SIBs are highlighted.

TI Battery resistance and its effects on performance of laminate film-type
   Co-PBA/Ni-PBA tertiary battery
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A tertiary battery (TB) can be charged by heating or cooling via the difference in the electrochemical Seebeck coefficient alpha between the cathode and anode. Here, we investigated the battery resistance R and its effect on the performance of a laminate film-type Na1.48Co[Fe(CN)6]0.87 (Co-PBA)/Na1.76Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.94 (Ni-PBA) TB. We found that the charge-transfer resistance R ct and diffusion resistance R dif are the dominant components of R, while the solution resistance R s has a minor role. Regardless of the solute type, R varied inversely proportional to the Na+ concentration M. In a high-R TB, the thermal voltage V TB and discharge capacity Q TB per unit weight of the total active material are significantly suppressed, which is quantitatively explained in terms of the voltage drop (IR, where I is current) during the discharge process.

TI Construction of multiple active sites by solution-free self-generating
   dual-template strategy: Boosting the ORR performance of NiFe/N-doped 3D
   porous carbon nanosheets
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that occurs at the cathode of fuel cells has vital influence on the overall performance of the related electrochemical energy conversion devices. Metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalysts are expected to take the place of traditional expensive commercial Pt-C as a new generation of ORR electrocatalyst. In this paper, a self-generating dual-template strategy was used to efficiently synthesize NiFe/N-doped 3D porous carbon nanosheets. In the specific synthesis process, the precursor of PBA (Ni3[Fe (CN)6]2) and the protective nitrogen-containing carbon source can be used as a primary pore-forming agent for in-situ forming of pore for the catalyst. The KCl and FeNi alloy produced in the synthesis process can also be used as an in-situ secondary template for pore forming of the electrocatalyst. The self-generating dualtemplate can not only produce porous structure to provide more interfaces and improve mass transfer, but also fabricate more active sites provided by N-doping and bimetal. The obtained NiFe/N-doped 3D porous carbon nanosheet (NFCN-MP400 0) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic methanol tolerance and durability in alkaline electrolytes. Its ORR activity was comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), and showed a limiting current density superior to that of Pt/C (6.10 mA cm-2). This work provides a strategy for the construction of electrocatalytic materials with high performance for methanol tolerance and durability. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of the reactants concentration on the synthesis and cycle life of
   copper hexacyanoferrate for aqueous Zn-ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) is a promising Zn2+ insertion material as positive electrode in mild aqueous Zn-ion batteries for power grid applications, due to its excellent power capability, non-toxicity, low cost and easy synthesis route. Here, the effect of the reactants? concentration and ratio during the synthesis of the CuHCF on the performance of the resulting material has been investigated through morphological, crystallographic and compositional analysis. Despite the different reaction?s conditions, the synthesised CuHCF powders did not show any significant change in their average particle size and morphology. Nevertheless, different structural and compositional characteristics have been observed for the different samples. In particular, different amounts of potassium have been found in the crystal structure of the investigated CuHCF materials. Subsequent electrochemical analysis demonstrated that the CuHCF with higher initial potassium content showed higher stability and therefore achieved longer cycle life.

TI Interface Engineering of a Sandwich Flexible Electrode PAn@CoHCF Rooted
   in Carbon Cloth for Enhanced Sodium-Ion Storage
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB With the growth of demand for flexible devices, the development of flexible electrodes used in energy storage devices has attracted much attention of researchers. In this work, a thin flexible cathode of Prussian blue analogue@polyaniline rooted in carbon cloth has been fabricated. The Prussian blue analogue (PBA) is an electrochemically active material grafted on flexible carbon cloth substrates, which had been precoated with polyaniline. Polyaniline as an intermediate layer can not only improve the overall electronic conductivity of the electrode but also enhance the adhesion and load of the PBAs. The electrochemical properties of the flexible cathode with a "sandwich" structure were determined in half-cells, with a superior capacity of 151 mA h.g(-1) and a striking cyclability with 96% capacity retention over 100 cycles at 100 mA h.g(-1). This work proposes a novel perspective for the structural construction and material synthesis of flexible positive electrodes and gives new options for the practical application of flexible batteries.

TI Enhancement in Desalination Performance of Battery Electrodes via
   Improved Mass Transport Using a Multichannel Flow System
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Desalination technologies have heavily been investigated to utilize the abundant salt water on Earth due to the global freshwater shortage. During recent years, the desalination battery (DB) has attracted attention for its low-cost, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient characteristics. However, the current DB system is subject to inevitable performance degradation because of the mass-transfer limitation at the electrode-electrolyte interface, particularly when the system is used to treat brackish water. Here, we present a novel strategy to overcome the intrinsic mass-transfer limitation of DB in brackish water using an effective cell design based on a multichannel flow system. Compared to the conventional DB that consists of one feed channel, the multichannel desalination battery (MC-DB) is configured using two side channels introducing a highly concentrated solution to the electrodes and one middle feed channel for water desalination. The MC-DB showed a desalination capacity of 52.9 mg g(-1) and a maximum salt removal rate of 0.0576 mg g(-1) s(-1) (production rate of 42.3 g m(-2) h(-1)) when a salinity gradient between the feed streams in the middle (10 mM NaCl) and side (1000 mM NaCl) channels was present, which were 3-fold higher than those in the case with no salinity gradient. In addition, the high concentration solution in the side channel significantly enhanced the rate capability of MC-DB, allowing the system to operate under a high current density of 40 A m(-2) with a desalination capacity of 34.1 mg g(-1). Considering the effect of electrolyte concentration on the battery electrode performance through electrochemical characterization, the highly saline medium at the side channel in the MC-DB creates an optimal environment for the battery electrode to fully capitalize the high desalination capacity, salt removal rate, and capacity retention of the battery electrodes.

TI An ultra-stable Mn-based Prussian blue compound effectively suppresses
   Jahn-Teller distortion as a superior cathode material for sodium-ion
   batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Among the potential cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMHCF) has attracted great interest because of its open 3D framework, cost-effectiveness, and high voltage properties. However, NaMHCF synthesized by the conventional coprecipitation method has the disadvantages of high crystal water and high defects. Herein, through an effective regulation strategy, the strong chelation between organic complex manganese salt and Na4Fe(CN)6 can greatly slow down the nucleation rate of the coprecipitation reaction and prepare low defect, low water content, high crystallization cubic phase NaMHCF. In situ XRD analysis shows that the cubic phase NaMHCF has no phase transformation during repeated charge and discharge, which greatly reduced the deterioration of the cathode caused by Jahn-Teller (J-T) distortion of Mn3+. Moreover, ex situ XPS and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) verified that the cubic phase NaMHCF crystal structure has low water content and lattice defects, and shows superior cycle stability with a capacity retention rate of about 90% at 350 mA g-1 over 300 cycles and impressive rate performance, and can still work normally even in low temperature environments (-20 degrees C). This work has great potential in the research of high-performance cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.
   By regulating the nucleation rate of the coprecipitation reaction, cubic NaMHCF was successfully prepared, which can effectively inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and can work normally as the cathode of SIB even in low-temperature environments.

TI Toward Paper-Based Sensors: Turning Electrical Signals into an Optical
   Readout System
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Paper-based sensors are gaining increasing attention for their potential applications in resource-limited settings and for point-of-care analysis. However, chemical analysis of paper-based electronic sensors is frequently interpreted using complex software and electronic displays which compromise the advantages of using paper. In this work, we present two semiquantitative paper-based readout systems that can visually measure a change in resistance of a resistive-based sensor. The readout systems use electrochromic Prussian blue/polyaniline as an electrochromic indicator on a resistive gold nanopartide film that is fabricated on paper. When the readout system is integrated with a resistive sensor in an electrical circuit, and a voltage is applied, the voltage drop along the readout system varies depending on the sensor's resistance. Due to the voltage gradient formed along the gold nanopartide film, the overlaying Prussian blue/polyaniline will change color at voltages greater than its reduction voltage (green/blue for oxidized state and transparent for reduced state). Thus, the changes in resistances of a sensor can be semiquantified through color visualization by either measuring the length of the transparent film (analog readout system) or by counting the number of transparent segments (digital readout system). The work presented herein can potentially serve as an alternative paper-based display system for resistive sensors in instances where cost and weight is a premium.

AB In CoFe Prussian Blue Analogs (PBAs), a small difference in the number of alkali cation per unit cell can lead to drastic differences in the properties of the PBA. We investigate the origin of this effect in order to be able to control it and design new functional materials for data storage devices. Here we characterize the Cs0.7Co4[Fe(CN)(6)](2.8)center dot 17 H2O and Cs2Co4[Fe(CN)(6)](3.3) center dot 11H(2)O PBAs by Co K-edge in situ XAS.

In the case of the Cs-0.7 PBA, the relaxation from the (CoFeIII)-Fe-II PI state towards the (CoFeII)-Fe-III ground state is monitored and quantified. All the results, fully consistent with previous magnetometry and Co L-3-edge XAS studies, are discussed with respect to the electronic structure of the Co ions in the different involved states.

TI Theoretical Study of the Structural Evolution of a
   Na2FeMn(CN)6 Cathode upon Na Intercalation
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB The Prussian Blue analog, NaxFeMn(CN)(6), is a potential new cathode material for Na-ion batteries. During Na intercalation, the dehydrated material exhibits a monoclinic to rhombohedral phase transition, while the hydrated material remains in the monoclinic phase. With density functional theory calculations, the phase transition is explained in terms of a competition between Coulomb attraction, Pauli repulsion, and d-pi covalent bonding. The interstitial Na cations have a strong Coulomb attraction to the N anions in the host material, which tend to bend the Mn-N bonds and reduce the volume of the structure. The presence of lattice H2O enhances the Pauli repulsion so that the volume reduction is suppressed. The calculated volume change, as it depends upon the presence of lattice H2O, is consistent with experimental measurements. Additionally, a new LiFeMn(CN)(6) phase is predicted where MnN6 octahedra decompose into LiN4 and MnN4 edge-sharing tetrahedra.

AB In the current study, we synthesized Prussian blue analogues, KxFe[Fe(CN)(6)] (KFeHCF) having different [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies, potassium contents (x), and crystal system, and investigated the effect of the difference on ion-sensor performance by using the KFeHCF as the solid-contact layer of all-solid-state ion-selective elec-trodes (ASS-ISEs). Cubic-KFeHCF shows slopy potential curve during galvanostatic K+ extraction/insertion because the reaction proceeds in single-phase regime, which deteriorates the long-term potential stability as internal reference electrode of ASS-ISEs. On the other hand, monoclinic-KFeHCF exhibits flat potential plateau during galvanostatic K+ extraction/insertion through two-phase reaction, providing superior potential stability. While the potential of an ISE is primarily determined by the membrane potential of the ion-sensitive membrane, it is discovered that the different crystal structure of the KFeHCF introduced into the solid-contact layer affects the long-term stability of ISE.

TI Reduction-Induced Topological Phase Transition to Construct
   K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] Superstructures for High-Performance
   Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO LANGMUIR
AB Potassium manganese-based Prussian blue analogs (KMn-HCF) hold great potential as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the rapid synthesis process often results in excessively small particle sizes, increasing surface area and thereby intensifying side reactions with the electrolyte, which can damage the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) and diminish cycling stability. Herein, we designed a topological phase transition strategy to assemble small KMn-HCF particles into a 600 nm cubic superstructure. Structurally, the assembled structure in KMn-HCF significantly improves the cycling stability and durability of KMn-HCF as a SIB cathode by reducing defects, enhancing the uniformity and stability of the CEI layer, minimizing contact with the electrolyte, and reinforcing structural integrity. From a compositional perspective, KMn-HCF exhibits lower Jahn-Teller distortion, reducing overall lattice distortion while allowing larger K+ to act as pillars, supporting the Mn-HCF framework and preventing capacity degradation caused by structural deterioration. The robust CEI layer formed in the KMn-HCF cubic superstructure delivered stable charge-discharge voltage profiles and reversible plateaus, achieving a capacity retention of 88.4%/89.1% after 1000 cycles at current densities of 0.1 and 0.5 A g-1, respectively.

TI Structure Remodeling Strategy for Open-Cage NiFe@Fe-bis-PBA with
   Enhanced Peroxidase-like Activity To Monitor Tumor Markers
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The inherent metal elements and structures of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanozymes have restricted their enzyme-mimicking activity. Therefore, the rational regulation of PBA nanozymes to improve their catalytic activity is highly desirable for biosensing applications. Herein, we propose a structure remodeling strategy to construct an open-cage Fe PBA-anchored NiFePBA (NiFe@Fe bis-PBA) nanozyme with significantly enhanced enzyme-mimicking activity. The formation process and mechanism for this bis-PBA nanozyme were studied in detail. Specifically, a cubic NiFePBA precursor was first synthesized and modified with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). With the aid of hydrochloric acid, the added potassium ferricyanide was reduced by PVP and re-coordinated on the surface of NiFePBA to form the NiFe@Fe bis-PBA nanozyme with a special open-cage core-shell structure. The resultant NiFe@Fe bis-PBA nanozyme was further exploited to immobilize secondary antibodies, serving as a novel signal probe for developing highly sensitive electrochemical immunosensors for monitoring tumor markers. The constructed electrochemical immunosensor possesses a very wide linear range of 0.005-100 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 0.89 pg/mL for alpha-fetoprotein with high specificity and acceptable reproducibility and stability. This work offers a general and promising strategy for remodeling PBA nanozymes with a very favorable structure and metal element distribution, which enhances their enzyme-mimicking properties for applications in different fields.

TI A vacancy-free sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate as cathode for
   sodium-ion battery by high-salt-concentration preparation
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnPBA) is attracting wide attention as an ideal low-cost cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of high specific capacity, three-dimensional open framework, and low cost. However, some issues, including high [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) vacancy concentration, a large amount of structural water in lattice, and nano-scale particles, hinder the practical application. Here, the effects of coprecipitation process under high-salt-concentration solution were systematically investigated to prepare a vacancy-free MnPBA with micro-spherical particle morphology. The sample (PBAT-80), prepared at ageing temperature of 80 degrees C for ageing time of 20 h, achieved high yield of 100 g L-1 (w/v = weight of production / liter of solution) and theoretical reversible capacity of 170 mAh g(-1). Moreover, the relationship between crystallinity and thermal stability of MnPBAs was further investigated and the different storage mechanisms of distinct water molecules were identified. These results will be attractive for commercial applications of SIBs in large-scale energy storage systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Structural regulated nickel hexacyanoferrate with superior sodium
   storage performance by K-doping
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue analogs with unique open frame structure have aroused great concern because of their low cost, environmental friendliness and relatively easy synthesis. Especially, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) attracts great attention due to its outstanding cycling stability. Herein, we regulate the structure of NiHCF by K-doping at Na-site and investigate the sodium storage performance by combining experiments with density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal that K-doping induces the transformation of NiHCF from cubic to monoclinic and provides more sodium storage sites. In addition, K+ ions can play a role of pillar in stabling the structure. More importantly, K-doping can improve the transport ability of sodium ions and electrons. As a result, the K-doped NiHCF electrode delivers an extremely high initial discharge capacity of 87.1 mAh g-1 at 10 mA g-1 with a very low capacity fading ratio of 0.016% per cycle at 800 mA g-1 over 1000 cycles. Such K-doped NiHCF composite shows its potential application prospects in the field of sodium-ion batteries.

TI Cubic KNiFe(CN)6/C loaded on nickel foam for rechargeable
   liquid/flexible Zn-air batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB KNiFe(CN)(6)/C/NF catalyst is prepared by a simple hydrothermal reaction. In this catalyst, the cubic structure of KNiFe(CN)(6) grows on the surface of the nickel foam (NF) to form a three-dimensional network structure. The formation of KNiFe(CN)(6) is based on the substitution of K+ by Ni2+ in K-3 [Fe(CN)(6)]. During this substitution process, some K+ vacancies will be formed in KNiFe(CN)(6), so that the catalytic activity can be improved. The KNiFe(CN)(6)/C/NF catalyst shows exhibited efficient electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, requiring low overpotentials of 69 and 231 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) current densities in 1.0 M KOH solution. When it is used as a catalyst for ZABs, KNiFe(CN)(6)/C/NF shows excellent high stability within 1000 cycles with a charge-discharge overpotential gap of 0.85 V at 5 mA cm(-2). The flexible battery assembled based on the KNiFe(CN)(6)/C/NF catalyst also has excellent performance, which can maintain stable charge and discharge within 50 cycles at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2).

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB A new Prussian blue analogue, hierarchical mesoporous octahedral K2Mn1-xCoxFe(CN)(6) (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2), has been successfully synthesized for the first time via a simple magnetically stirred process. K2Mn1-xCoxFe(CN)(6) (x-0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2) was selected as a cathode material for sodium ion batteries to increase their lattice parameters, along with the large available tunnels for Na+ diffusion. We also introduce cobalt into the framework to stabilize the crystal structure and improve the electronic conductivity of the KMHFC particles. These composites are characterized via powder X-ray diffractometry, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Among the samples, K2Mn0.9Co0.1Fe(CN)(6) exhibits the best electrochemical performance as a cathode material for sodium ion batteries, with a discharge capacity of 116 mA h g(-1) after 150 cycles at 10 mA g(-1). This superior electrochemical property could be ascribed to its unique hierarchical architecture, improved electronic conductivity, and robust structure.

TI Metal-organic Framework-driven Porous Cobalt Disulfide Nanoparticles
   Fabricated by Gaseous Sulfurization as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for
   Overall Water Splitting
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Both high activity and mass production potential are important for bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Catalytic activity enhancement was demonstrated through the formation of CoS2 nanoparticles with mono-phase and extremely porous structures. To fabricate porous structures at the nanometer scale, Co-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), namely a cobalt Prussian blue analogue (Co-PBA, Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)), was used as a porous template for the CoS2. Then, controlled sulfurization annealing converted the Co-PBA to mono-phase CoS2 nanoparticles with similar to 4 nm pores, resulting in a large surface area of 915.6 m(2) g(-1). The electrocatalysts had high activity for overall water splitting, and the overpotentials of the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction under the operating conditions were 298 mV and -196 mV, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2).

   Coordination Polymer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The mechanism that governs the conversion of the Co-Prussian blue analogue (PBA) to Co2C was investigated and observed to exhibit lag phase growth behavior that can be fit to the autocatalytic kinetic model. The energetics and activation energies were extracted from the temperature-dependent data. The experimental results provide insight into how to control the size and crystallinity of Co2C, where shorter lag times and smaller sizes occur at higher reaction temperatures and longer times and larger sizes at lower temperatures. Investigation of temperature-dependent growth revealed an R-2 relationship, supporting a surface mediated growth model. In addition, low temperatures lead to higher polycrystallinity in the nanocrystal that grows within the PBA framework.

TI Algae-inspired multifunctional ocean solar-energy conversion chain
   enabled by coordination polymers
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Ocean solar energy is important for underwater devices. However, the intermittent irradiation and the requirements of many accompanying functional parts make the related devices huge and expensive. It is still a challenge to realize an all-in-one solar-energy conversion platform that can provide a continuous power supply, seawater sensing, and environment restoration simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate an algae-inspired strategy to achieve a multiple-function, ocean solar-energy conversion chain. Specifically, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) of coordination polymers serve as a robust transshipment depot to connect a photon-driven oxygen-evolution part, with other components enabling the underwater system to produce electricity and oxygen for low-oxygen-zone restoration, to supply continuous day and night electricity, and to sense seawater in authentic seawater. The stability of the system is demonstrated for more than 100 day-night cycles. The concept presented here highlights the prospect of using ocean solar energy to achieve multiple tasks with an all-in-one platform.

TI Structural Phase Transition Triggered by Na Ordering in
   Na1.96Cd[Fe(CN)6]0.99
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are nanoporous materials that consist of a cyano-bridged three-dimensional (3D) metal framework, i.e., -M-NC-Fe-CN-M- (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Cd), and a guest alkali metal and H2O. Among the various PBAs, a Cd compound has a large framework with a side of similar to 5.4 angstrom. We found that Na1.96Cd[Fe(CN)(6)](0.99) shows a phase transition from a cubic (Fm (3) over barm; Z = 4) to a monoclinic ( I12=m1; Z = 2) structure at 400K with a decrease in temperature. During the cubic phase, Na+ is located at the octahedral (48g) site. Based on structural analysis, we ascribed the transition into a monoclinic phase to the Na ordering at the stable site among the octahedral sites.

TI Mitigating Jahn-Teller Effects by Fast Electrode Kinetics Inducing
   Charge Redistribution
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Manganese hexacyanomanganates have attracted significant attention as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries owing to the high theoretical capacity and low cost of Mn resources. Because of the strong Jahn-Teller effect, causing unstable local phase transition and distortion, the redox reactions of the high-spin state of Mn(III) are considered to be a conundrum. Herein, it is reported that the charge-redistribution mechanism of low-spin Mn-III + high-spin Mn-III -> low-spin Mn-II + high-spin Mn-IV in manganese hexacyanomanganates can decrease unstable high-spin Mn-III, leading to the mitigation of Jahn-Teller distortion. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggest that the fast reaction rate activates charge redistribution. Moreover, different crystal structures, reported using post-mortem synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis, confirm a large orthorhombic structure, thus verifying the presence of charge redistribution based on the superexchange rule. These results demonstrate that manganese hexacyanomanganate in an aqueous electrolyte can achieve long-term cyclability, thus paving the way for high-performance batteries.

TI Morphology adjustable CoxN with 3D mesoporous structure and
   amorphous N-doped carbon for overall water splitting
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB In order to improve the efficiency of the water splitting system, many researchers have focused on controlling the nanostructure of the catalysts, which could reduce the overpotential value of the overall water splitting process. Herein, we report the characteristics of the overall water splitting of cobalt nitrides synthesized in the same way but differing only in the temperature of nitridation. Hierarchical phases (Co3N, Co3N/Co4N, and Co4N) and structures (mesoporous nanocubes, porous nanocubes, and aggregated particles) of CoxN with different thickness of amorphous N-doped carbon allowed CoxN to have different overpotential values (419 mV, 557 mV, and 606 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2)), which is in contrast to known theoretical electrical properties. Our research about the comparison of hierarchical structure of CoxN offers the potential as advanced electro-catalysts for many materials that have not yet been morphologically controlled.

TI A S-Scheme MOF-on-MOF Heterostructure
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Constructing MOF-on-MOF heterojunction with elaborate charge transfer mechanism and interface is a promising strategy for improving the photocatalytic properties of MOFs. Herein, a Step-scheme (S-scheme) MIL-125-NH2@CoFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) heterojunction is reported for the first time. The MOF-on-MOF heterostructure exhibits a sandwich-like morphology with hollow CoFe PBA nanocages selectively assembled on the top-down surfaces of MIL-125-NH2 nanocakes. Experimental findings and theoretical simulation results reveal the formation of internal electric field via interfacial Ti-O-Co bonds at the heterojunction, providing driving force and atomic transportation highway for accelerating the S-scheme charge transfer and enhancing the redox performance. Contributed further by the hollow sandwich-like structures with increased active site exposure, the designed MOF-on-MOF heterojunction exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for degradation of various organic pollutants. This study provides insights toward the rational design of semiconducting MOF-based heterojunctions with improved properties.

TI Copper hexacyanoferrate as a long-life cathode for aqueous aluminum ion
   batteries
SO MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY
AB Aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) have emerged as promising low-cost and energy-dense alternatives to conventional lithium-ion batteries. However, AAIBs exhibit a poor rate capability and limited cycle life owing to the rapid degradation. In this study, a copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCFe) electrode was introduced into AAIBs with an aluminum trifluoromethanesulfonate aqueous electrolyte. Common aluminum electrolytes were compared to highlight the effects of anions and pure acid solutions were examined to eliminate the concerns on proton. A reversible capacity of 69.35 mAh/g was obtained at 70 mA/g, with 73% capacity maintained at 50 C, exhibiting excellent rate performance. Furthermore, the types of anions played an important role in the electrochemical performance. With triflate anions, the CuHCFe electrode exhibited remarkable cycling stability with a neglectable capacity loss in 3000 cycles (eight months of continuous testing) at 70 mA/g and 70% retention after 2300 cycles at 350 mA/g. Ex situ characterization revealed that both transition metals in CuHCFe were simultaneously involved in the redox reaction with minimal lattice change upon ion insertion/extraction. The results demonstrate the compatibility and potential of CuHCFe cathodes and aluminum triflate electrolytes for AAIBs, which can promote the development of such batteries for electrochemical energy storage.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Core-Shell CoS2@MoS2 with Hollow Heterostructure
   as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO MOLECULES
AB It is imperative to develop an efficient catalyst to reduce the energy barrier of electrochemical water decomposition. In this study, a well-designed electrocatalyst featuring a core-shell structure was synthesized with cobalt sulfides as the core and molybdenum disulfide nanosheets as the shell. The core-shell structure can prevent the agglomeration of MoS2, expose more active sites, and facilitate electrolyte ion diffusion. A CoS2/MoS2 heterostructure is formed between CoS2 and MoS2 through the chemical interaction, and the surface chemistry is adjusted. Due to the morphological merits and the formation of the CoS2/MoS2 heterostructure, CoS2@MoS2 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process in an alkaline electrolyte. To reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2, only 254 mV of overpotential is required for CoS2@MoS2, which is smaller than that of pristine CoS2 and MoS2. Meanwhile, the small Tafel slope (86.9 mV dec-1) and low charge transfer resistance (47 Omega) imply the fast dynamic mechanism of CoS2@MoS2. As further confirmed by cyclic voltammetry curves for 1000 cycles and the CA test for 10 h, CoS2@MoS2 shows exceptional catalytic stability.

TI Development of a Highly Sensitive Imprinted Electrochemical Sensor for
   the Detection of Hydrocortisone in Wastewater
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The existence of hydrocortisone in water resources is a serious threat to human health. However, the rapid and sensitive detection methods for hydrocortisone in wastewater are still lacking. Meanwhile, due to the weak redox activity of hydrocortisone, electrochemical technique cannot be used to detect hydrocortisone directly. Therefore, molecularly imprinted technique combined with prussian blue nanoparticles was synthesized for detecting HC indirectly in this work. We fabricated a novel and highly sensitive molecularly imprinted sensor based on the polydopamine/electro-reduced graphene oxide, which was used for the specific recognition of hydrocortisone in water samples. The prussian blue nanoparticles were introduced as probes to reflect the concentration of the target. The morphology of the prepared sensors was characterized by the scanning electron microscopy. And the feature of the imprinted electrode was performed by the cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the relative current signal of prussian blue decreased linearly with the increase of hydrocortisone concentration with a limit of detection 0.006 nM. Moreover, the imprinted sensor had a much higher affinity towards hydrocortisone than other analogues. Then, this system was successfully applied to determine hydrocortisone in real wastewater samples with workable results.

SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB As concerns about the safety of lithium-ions batteries (LIBs) increases, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) with a lower cost, higher safety, and higher co-efficiency have attracted more and more interest. However, finding suitable cathode materials is still an urgent problem in ZIBs. In recent years, a lot of significant works have been reported, including manganese-based cathodes, vanadium-based cathodes, Prussian blue analog-based materials, and sustainable quinone cathodes. In this review, some typical cathode materials are introduced. The detailed storage mechanisms and methods for improving the reaction kinetics of the zinc ions are summarized. Finally, the issues, challenges, and the research directions are provided.

TI LaFeO3 porous hollow micro-spindles for NO2
   sensing
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB LaFeO3 micro-spindles with intriguing structural characteristics were synthesized using cyano-bridged coordination polymers as sacrificial templates. Within a longitudinal dimension of less than 5 mu m, each micro-spindle features a hollow center contained in a mesoporous shell with hexagonal cross section. Conductometric gas sensors developed from these micro-spindles demonstrate a comprehensively improved NO2-sensing performance over other-reported LaFeO3 devices, including lower operating temperature (155 degrees C), higher sensitivity (response of 81.4% under 5 ppm) and expedited response and recovery (40 s/329 s). Such performance is enabled by a semiconducting mechanism governed by the formation and catalytic dissociation of nitrite species during NO2 adsorption on LaFeO3, facilitated by the special hierarchical structure of the micro-spindle.

TI Preparation of a Ni-Fe-based transition metal phosphide as an efficient
   electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB It is incredibly essential to generate catalysts that both have abundant reserves and are highly active for the oxygen evolution process (OER) in electrocatalytic water-splitting technology. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) offer enormous potential in the field of the OER due to their programmable metal centers, controllable electron density and customizable structure. The active components of the Ni-Fe PBA nanocubes were deposited on the Ni(OH)(2) nanoflower structures to create distinct morphologies. After phosphidation at 375 degrees C with CN group decomposition in Ni-Fe PBA, the obtained bimetallic phosphide demonstrated excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline solutions, reaching current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm(-2) with overpotentials of only 222 and 242 mV, respectively. The Tafel slope is only 40.9 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the Ni2P-Fe2P/NF catalyst shows long-term stability without noticeable deterioration after 100 hours. Our research identifies a highly effective technique for creating enhanced electrode materials for OER electrocatalysts.

TI Electronic Structure and Electron-Transport Properties of Three Metal
   Hexacyanoferrates
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Metal hexacyanometallates, or Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), are active materials in important electrochemical technologies, including next-generation sodium- and potassium-ion batteries. They have tunable properties, including reduction potential, ionic conductivity, and color. However, little is known about their electronic conductivities. In this work, we use density-functional theory to model the electronic structure and to explore the likely electron-conduction mechanism in three promising cathodes (manganese, iron, and cobalt hexacyanoferrate) in each of three oxidation states. First, we demonstrate that hybrid functionals reliably reproduce experimentally observed spin configurations and geometric phase changes. We confirm these materials are semiconductors or insulators with band gaps ranging from 1.90 eV up to 4.94 eV. We further identify that for most of the compounds, the electronic band edges originate from carbon-coordinated iron orbitals, suggesting that doping at the carbon-coordinated site may strongly affect carrier conductivity. Finally, we calculate charge-carrier effective masses, which we find are very heavy. This study is an important foundation for making electronic conductivity a tunable PBA material property.

TI CoFeP hollow cube as advanced electrocatalyst for water oxidation
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Electrocatalysts with hollow structure and appropriate components are favorable for the water splitting application. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have recently been utilized to synthesize the corresponding derivatives with various functions because of their diverse geometries and tunable constituents. Herein, novel CoFeP nanocages are obtained from CoFe-PBA nanocube precursor via a facile phosphorization route. The porous hollow structure and unique multivoid interior provide exposed active sites and large surface area. For the CoFeP catalyst, both Co and Fe serve as active sites, and the synergism between them induces optimized electronic structure. The resulting CoFeP nanocages act as advanced OER catalyst in alkaline medium, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low overpotential of 180 mV, a small turnover frequency of 0.93 s(-1) at the overpotential of 270 mV, and superior stability.

TI Origin of enhanced capacity retention of aqueous potassium-ion batteries
   using monohydrate-melt electrolyte
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB A potassium salt monohydrate melt was prepared as an electrolyte for aqueous K-ion batteries by mixing potassium salts of bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (FSA(-)) and triflate (OTf-) in a 6:4 molar ratio, and the physicochemical properties and electrode reactions in the hydrate melt electrolyte were compared with those of KFSA center dot 1.8H(2)O and KOTf center dot 2.8H(2)O. Since the K(FSA)(0.6)(OTf)(0.4)center dot 1.0H(2)O has a wider potential window of 2.56 V than the endmembers, the monohydrate melt electrolyte realizes highly reversible charge-discharge cycles of an aqueous K-ion battery of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) parallel to K2Fe0.5Mn0.5[Fe(CN)(6)]. The K2Fe0.5Mn0.5[Fe(CN)(6)] electrode exhibited less degradation of the electrode and crystal structures in the monohydrate melt than in the endmembers. Further, the reversible charge-discharge reaction of PTCDI in the monohydrate melt electrolyte is attributed to the lower solubility of PTCDI and the formation of solid electrolyte interphase consisting of FSA(-) decomposed products such as KF.

TI Quantifying the trade-offs between energy consumption and salt removal
   rate in membrane-free cation intercalation desalination
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Electrochemical desalination devices that use redox-active cation intercalation electrodes show promise for desalination of salt-rich water resources with high water recovery and low energy consumption. While previous modeling and experiments used ion-exchange membranes to maximize charge efficiency, here a membrane-free alternative is evaluated to reduce capital cost by using a porous diaphragm to separate Na1+xNiFe(CN)(6) electrodes. Two-dimensional porous-electrode modeling shows that, while charge efficiency losses are inherent to a diaphragm-based architecture, charge efficiency values approaching the anion transference number (61% for NaCl) are achievable for diaphragms with sufficiently low salt conductance. Closed-form equations are thereby derived that relate charge efficiency to the non-dimensional Peclet and Damkohler numbers that enable the selection of current and flow velocity to produce a desired degree-of-desalination. Simulations using these conditions are used to quantify the tradeoffs between energy consumption and salt removal rate for diaphragm-based cells operated at a range of currents. The simulated distributions of reactions are shown to result from the local salt concentration variations within electrodes using diffusion-potential theory. We also simulate the cycling dynamics of various flow configurations and show that flow-through electrodes exceed the degree-of-desalination compared with flow-by and flow-behind configurations due to solution stagnation within electrodes.

TI Self-template and in-situ synthesis strategy to construct
   MnO2/Mn3O4@Ni-Co/GC nanocubes for
   efficient microwave absorption properties
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The combination of magnetic nanoparticles and transition metal oxides has attracted much attention in microwave absorption applications. Herein, the MnO2/Mn3O4@Ni-Co/graphite carbon (GC) nanocubes with porous structure and ultrathin nanosheets was constructed by self-template strategy and in-situ synthesis. The composites not only synergize the magnetic loss of magnetic Ni-Co nanoparticles with the dielectric losses of GC and MnO2/Mn3O4 , but also enhance the multiple interface polarization and improve impedance matching. As a result, the MnO2/Mn3O4 @Ni-Co/GC nanocubes present outstanding electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption performances, in which a RLmin of -26 dB at 6.4 GHz with a thickness of 4 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth covering from 5.3 GHz to 6.4 GHz are achieved. Meanwhile, the widest effective absorption bandwidth with the value of 3.7 GHz can be achieved at a matching thickness of 2.0 mm. More importantly, this work provides a new strategy for the synthesis of EMW absorbing materials. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Investigation of alkali-ion (Li, Na and K) intercalation in manganese
   hexacyanoferrate KxMnFe(CN)6 as cathode material
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB KxMnFe(CN)(6) are attractive cathode candidates for alkali-ion batteries due to the resource abundance and open three-dimensional framework. In this work, electrochemical characterizations combined with theoretical calculations are carried out to study the intercalation properties of Li+, Na+, K+ in MnFe(CN)(6) framework. It achieves reversible capacities of 120.9, 117.1 and 104.8 mAh g(-1) for Li, Na, and K storage, respectively, with average voltage of 3.7 V versus Li/Li+, 3.5 V versus Na/Na+ and 3.8 V versus K/K+. DFT calculations reveal the occupy sites, diffusion pathways and working potentials for the Li+, Na+ and K+-(de)intercalation in the MnFe (CN) 6 framework. It is demonstrated for the first time that the migration energy barriers of Na+ is lower than that of Li+ and K+, thus resulting in the best rate performances for Na+-storage. The higher potential for K+ intercalation could be attributed to the high binding energy of K+ and MnFe(CN) 6 framework. Electrochemical mechanisms suggest that the MnHCF undergoes reversible orthorhombic-cubic phase transition upon Li+/K+ insertion/extraction, while is irreversible during the repeated Na+ insertion/extraction. In addition, novel K-ion batteries based on all-PBA electrodes (KxMnFe(CN)(6) and Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)) are constructed, delivering reversible capacity of 84.9 mAh g(-1) with high average voltage of 2.8 V. This work provides theoretical guidance for the development of high performance and sustainable PBA materials for alkali-ion batteries.

TI A cookbook for the investigation of coordination polymers by transition
   metal K-edge XMCD
SO JOURNAL OF SYNCHROTRON RADIATION
AB In order to disentangle the physical effects at the origin of transition metal Kedge X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) in coordination polymers and quantify small structural distortions from the intensity of these signals, a systematic investigation of Prussian blue analogs as model compounds is being conducted. Here the effects of the temperature and of the external magnetic field are tackled; none of these external parameters modify the shape of the XMCD signal but they both critically modify its intensity. The optimized experimental conditions, as well as a reliable and robust normalization procedure, could thus be determined for the study of the intrinsic parameters. Through an extended discussion on measurements on other XMCD-dedicated beamlines and for other coordination compounds, we finally provide new transition metal K-edge XMCD users with useful information to initiate and successfully carry out their projects.

TI In-situ generation of In2O3 nanoparticles inside
   In[Co(CN)6] quasi-metal-organic-framework nanocubes for
   efficient electroreduction of CO2 to formate
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Three-dimensional (3D) network structure of metal-organic framework (MOF) can accommodate outstanding electrocatalysis performances, but always collapse during the conversion to active materials or applications process. How to maintain the 3D network when producing active species is of great importance for full application of MOF. Herein, a new MOF material, In[Co(CN)(6)] (In-Co PBA) nanocubes, are firstly synthesized. Through a controlled low-temperature deligandation process, the In-Co PBA nanocubes are transformed to a novel In2O3@In-Co PBA quasi-MOF nanocubes, which basically retain the 3D porous structure of PBA but with in situ generated In2O3 nanoparticles inside. When used as CO2RR electrocatalyst, such a novel cubic composite structure exhibits excellent performances with faradaic efficiency of 85% for formate at a potential of -0.96 V and with current density of 31.5 mA.cm(-2) at -1.32 V, surpassing most of the reported indium-based catalysts. The excellent performance can be attributed to the special composite structure, which provides not only active sites by In2O3 nanoparticles to catalyze CO2RR, but also the 3D porous framework by quasi-MOF to accelerate gaseous exchange and electrolyte permeation and prevent the electrode choking. This work offers a new strategy for the design of post-transition metal catalysts and the structure design of quasi-MOF. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Potassium Selenocyanate (KSeCN) Additive Enabled Stable Cathode
   Electrolyte Interphase and Iron Dissolution Inhibition toward
   Long-Cycling Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are promising energy storage devices owing to the close redox potential of potassium (K) to lithium and rich abundance of K resource, thus promoting the exploration of efficient cathode materials for K-ions storage. Fe-based Prussian blue analogues (KFeHCF) are promising cathode materials for KIBs due to their combined advantages in low cost and high energy density. However, the rapid capacity decay induced by unstable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and dissolution of transition metal ions leads to limited lifespans (e.g., hundreds of cycles) of K parallel to KFeHCF batteries. Incorporating additives into electrolytes is an economical and effective way to construct robust CEI for high-performance KIBs. Herein, a multifunctional electrolyte additive, potassium selenocyanate (KSeCN), is introduced to effectively construct stable, homogeneous and conductive CEI films, which leads to the inhibition of Fe dissolution and stabilization of KFeHCF structure during cycling. With 0.5 wt% of KSeCN in conventional carbonated electrolyte, the K parallel to KFeHCF battery exhibits promoted cycling performance with a capacity retention rate of 87% after 500 cycles at 4.5 V cutoff voltage. This finding provides a new paradigm for developing and designing potassium-ion battery electrolytes.
   An electrolyte additive modification strategy to manipulate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) properties on Prussian blue analogs surface. The potassium selenocyanate is introduced to construct stable and conductive CEI films, which leads to the inhibition of Fe dissolution and stabilization of cathode structure. This facile/efficient strategy will provide extensive inspiration to the researchers in potassium-ion batteries field.image

TI Mechanisms of Degradation of Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6]
   Functional Electrodes in Aqueous Media: A Combined Theoretical and
   Experimental Study
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are versatile functional materials with numerous applications ranging from electrocatalysis and batteries to sensors and electrochromic devices. stability strongly depends on the electrolyte composition. In this work, we use density functional theory calculations and experiments to elucidate the mechanisms of degradation of model Na2Ni[Fe(CN)(6)] functional electrodes in aqueous electrolytes. Next to the solution pH and cation concentration, we identify anion adsorption as a major driving force for electrode dissolution. Notably, the nature of adsorbed anions can control the mass and charge transfer mechanisms during metal cation intercalation as well as the electrode degradation rate. We find that weakly adsorbing anions, such as NO3-, impede the degradation, while strongly adsorbing anions, such as SO42-, accelerate it. The results of this study provide practical guidelines for electrolyte optimization and can likely be extrapolated to the whole family of PBAs operating in aqueous media.

TI Nanoframes of Co3O4-Mo2N
   Heterointerfaces Enable High-Performance Bifunctionality toward Both
   Electrocatalytic HER and OER
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Interfacial engineering of heterostructured catalysts has attracted great interest in enabling both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), by fine tuning of the interfacial geometry and electronic structures. However, they are not well structured for high-performing bifunctionalities, largely due to the confined single particle morphologies, where the exposed surfaces and interfaces are limited. Herein, a hollow nanoframing strategy is purposely devised for interconnected Co3O4-Mo2N heterostructures that are designed with interfacial charge transfer from Mo2N to Co3O4, as rationalized by theoretical calculations and confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. It is shown that by the controllable pyrolysis of bimetallic Mo-Co Prussian blue analogue nanoframes (NFs) with an optimal Mo/Co ratio, the desired nanoframes of Co3O4-Mo2N heterostructure are successfully formed. The as-synthesized Co3O4-Mo2N NFs not only inherit the functionalities of individual components and the electrolyte-accessible nanoframe structure, and they also give an ideal heterointerface with strong electron interaction and favorable H2O/H* adsorption energies, leading to a remarkable enhancement in bifunctional catalytic activities (i.e., 12.9-fold and 20-fold higher current density under the 300 mV overpotential, as compared to the single-phased Co3O4 NFs alone toward HER and OER, respectively), while remaining a robust stability.

TI Study of Incorporating Cesium into Copper Hexacyanoferrate by Density
   Functional Theory Calculations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu-HCF), a Prussian blue analogue, has the ability to incorporate Cs+ ions into its structure; it is thus a candidate to selectively extract radioactive Cs+ from water and to sequester it. We use density functional theory calculations to probe the incorporation of Cs+, K+, and Na+ ions into Cu-HCF. Specifically, we determine their incorporation energies, energies for the exchange of alkali ions, lattice stabilities, and the strengths of the bonds between the transition metal and CN ligand. We find that all of these are more favorable for Cs+ than for either Na+ or K+. In addition, we analyze the electronic structure to explain the favorability of Cs+ incorporation. Cu-HCF is found to switch from a ferromagnetic structure to an antiferromagnetic structure as the number of incorporated alkali ions increases.

TI Ammonia Concentrator for Repeatable Adsorption/Desorption Using Nickel
   Hexacyanoferrate as Adsorbent and Production of Solid Ammonium
   Bicarbonate
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Ammonia serves as both a valuable substance and an environmental pollutant. Its recovery and reuse offer a promising approach to mitigate environmental impacts while reducing costs for treatment, production, and CO2 emissions. In this article, we present a flow system to develop efficient methods for the recovery and reuse of ammonia. In this system, adsorption and desorption were subsequently conducted without relocating the adsorbent column. In the experiment, the adsorbent was composed of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) granules, the inlet gas contained approximately 19,000 ppm of NH3 in the air, and the washing liquid for the desorption was NH4HCO3 solution. The outlet NH3 concentration decreased to 3 vol % of the inlet at first and then gradually increased. During desorption, ammonium concentration in the washing liquid increased, and the pH was kept around 8 due to CO2 introduction. After the adsorption and desorption cycles, the washing liquid was cooled to 5 degrees C, and a NH4HCO3 solid was precipitated. Moreover, NH4HCO3 solid was obtained inasmuch as the adsorbed amount after repeating the adsorption and desorption several times. This study demonstrates the continuous operation of adsorption and desorption cycles and that NiHCF granules can adsorb and desorb NH3 repeatedly.

TI Open-framework aluminum hexacyanoferrate as a cathode material for high
   voltage aqueous zinc-ion batteries: effect of Al<SUP>3+</SUP> cations on
   three-phase transition of AlFe(CN)6
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered promising energy storage devices for future large-scale energy storage systems due to their high safety, low production cost, and non-combustibility. However, low operating voltage and energy output are still drawbacks in their practical applications. Herein, we develop a cubic aluminum hexacyanoferrate/graphene high-voltage cathode material for rechargeable AZIBs, and it exhibits an activation process and can deliver a high output voltage of 1.8 V (vs. Zn/Zn2+) with a specific energy density of 125.56 W h kg(-1). The voltage is increased by stretching the Fe-C bonds in the Fe-C=N-Al covalent structure. The reversible phase transformation between cubic AlFe(CN)(6) and cubic-orthorhombic-monoclinic Zn0.5AlFe(CN)(6) occurs with the intercalation/extraction of zinc ions, and the coordination environment of Al plays a decisive role in this key process. This work will provide a feasible reference for the structural design of high-voltage Prussian blue analog cathode materials.

TI CeO2 nanoparticles-decorated CoP nanocubes for accelerating alkaline
   electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction
SO PARTICUOLOGY
AB Constructing heterojunction interface as an active catalyst is an effective strategy to boost electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report an interfacial CoP/CeO2 heterostructure catalyst constructed by interface engineering and selective phosphorization procedure. X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests that coupling CeO2 nanoparticles on the surface of CoP will generate interfacial interaction at the two-phase interface, resulting in electron transfer between CoP and CeO2 components at the interface. Benefitting from the interfacial interaction, large exposed inter-face area, and luxuriant mesopores structure, CoP/CeO2 shows fascinating alkaline OER performance. At the current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm-2, the optimal CoP/CeO2 heterojunction exhibits lower overpotential (257 and 298 mV) than either CoP (288 and 354 mV) or RuO2 (305 and 409 mV). This work provides a facile synthetic protocol for constructing heterostructure interfaces to improve OER performance.(c) 2023 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI Deciphering ligand-controlled charge transfer from a metal-organic
   framework to cadmium sulfide for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen
   evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The suitable choice of a cocatalyst plays an important role in charge separation and transport and hence the hydrogen evolution activity of the photocatalyst. Herein, we have demonstrated the cocatalytic activities of two different metal-organic frameworks: CoFe-Prussian blue analog (CoFe-PBA) and CoFe-nitroprusside (CoFe-NP) loaded on CdS nanorods. The replacement of a -CN group of PBA with a strong & pi;-acidic ligand, -NO, produces NP with a significant difference in the electronic structure. The introduction of -NO results in an increased positive charge density on the metal centers of CoFe-NP, making it more susceptible to charge carrier transport from CdS through strong back donation than CoFe-PBA. Under the best reaction conditions, NP-CdS-2 produces hydrogen at a rate of 1735 & mu;mol g(-1) h(-1), significantly higher than those of bare CdS and PBA-CdS. Moreover, transient absorption spectroscopy has revealed a long-lived charge separated state in NP-CdS-2 to enhance the photocatalytic activity.

TI Cell voltage control on ion selectivity of carbon nanotube-copper
   hexacyanoferrate with enhanced electrochemical deionization performance
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB This study utilizes a simple co-precipitation method to synthesize copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) composites reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (denoted as CuHCF@CNTs) serving as superior electrode materials for the electrochemical deionization (ECDI) application, a versatile method for brackish water deionization, water softening, and heavy metal removal. The enhanced performance of CuHCF, one of the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with typical Faradaic cation-capturing capability, is attributed to the increased charge transfer and a large surface area provided by multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for the promoting the utilization of CuHCF units within the composites. The ion selectivity of electrode materials is investigated using both batch and microfluidic reactors, revealing a selectivity sequence of K+ > Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+. Additionally, this study introduces a novel approach for controlling the ion selectivity of CuHCF@CNT from the operating voltage. By varying the cell voltage, the selectivity factor, beta(K/Mg), can be increased from 1.7 at 1.2 V to 4.5 at 0.6 V. Our research offers a new perspective on the ion-capturing selectivity of ECDI systems using Faradaic materials in deionization and ion-concentrating applications.

TI Promising Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries from Lab to

SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB Sodium-ion batteries ( SIBs) are seen as an emerging force for future large-scale energy storage due to their cost-effective nature and high safety. Compared with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the energy density of SIBs is insufficient at present. Thus, the development of high-energy SIBs for realizing large-scale energy storage is extremely vital. The key factor determining the energy density in SIBs is the selection of cathodic materials, and the mainstream cathodic materials nowadays include transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds, and Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). The cathodic materials would greatly improve after targeted modulations that eliminate their shortcomings and step from the laboratory to practical applications. Before that, some remaining challenges in the application of cathode materials for large-scale energy storage SIBs need to be addressed, which are summarized at the end of this Outlook.

TI Effect of Static Jahn-Teller Distortion on the Li<SUP>+</SUP> Transport
   in a Copper Hexacyanoferrate Framework
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) are potential cathode-active materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Although a body of research has assessed the performances of various PB/PBA cathodes with an eye to practical use, the underlying Li+-transport mechanism is still unclear. Focusing on copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF), a PBA that exhibits static Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion, we theoretically investigate how the framework's distortion affects the pathways and energetics of the Li+ transport. Density functional theory calculations of a local structure model of CuHCF reveal that the static JT distortion makes the favorable Li+-transport pathways quasi-two-dimensional, contrary to an intuitive picture of isotropic Li+ diffusion within the regular jungle-gym framework. The pathways are mutually interconnected, thereby creating an almost barrierless transport network. To better understand the distortion-induced transport anisotropy, we visually analyze the framework's electronic structure and noncovalent Li+-framework interactions. This study helps deepen the fundamental understanding of intrinsic Li+-transport properties of a distorted porous framework.

TI Building Robust Manganese Hexacyanoferrate Cathode for Long-Cycle-Life
   Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Manganese Hexacyanoferrate (Mn & horbar;HCF) is a preferred cathode material for sodium-ion batteries used in large-scale energy storage. However, the inherent vacancies and the presence of H2O within the imperfect crystal structure of Mn & horbar;HCF lead to material failure and interface failure when used as a cathode. Addressing the challenge of constructing a stable cathode is an urgent scientific problem that needs to be solved to enhance the performance and lifespan of these batteries. In this review, the crystal structure of Mn & horbar;HCF is first introduced, explaining the formation mechanism of vacancies and exploring the various ways in which H2O molecules can be present within the crystal structure. Then comprehensively summarize the mechanisms of material and interfacial failure in Mn & horbar;HCF, highlighting the key factors contributing to these issues. Additionally, eight modification strategies designed to address these failure mechanisms are encapsulated, including vacancy regulation, transition metal substitution, high entropy, the pillar effect, interstitial H2O removal, surface coating, surface vacancy repair, and cathode electrolyte interphase reinforcement. This comprehensive review of the current research advances on Mn & horbar;HCF aims to provide valuable guidance and direction for addressing the existing challenges in their application within SIBs.

TI Structural water enhanced intercalation of magnesium ions in copper
   hexacyanoferrate nonaqueous batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB In this article we investigate copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) as a nonaqueous magnesium ion battery (MIB) cathode, and the positive influence of structural water on its Mg2+ storage properties. The hydrated and dehydrated forms of CuHCF (H- and D-CuHCF) each displayed excellent rate capabilities and extended lifetimes with zero capacity loss. However, H-CuHCF delivers a specific capacity 25% higher than that of D-CuHCF. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge reveal a redox reaction present only in the hydrated CuHCF, which accounts for 25% of its total reversible capacity (63 mAh g(-1) at 25 mA g(-1)). Furthermore, ex-situ FTIR reveals that the structural water of H-CuHCF remains in the lattice during charging/discharging. We propose that water provides partial electrostatic screening between the CuHCF lattice and Mg ions, while allowing an additional redox transition to become thermodynamically accessible.

TI Charge-Transfer Phase Transition of a Cyanide-Bridged
   Fe<SUP>II</SUP>/Fe<SUP>III</SUP> Coordination Polymer
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Heterometallic Prussian blue analogues are known to exhibit thermally induced charge transfer, resulting in switching of optical and magnetic properties. However, charge-transfer phase transitions have not been reported for the simplest FeFe cyanide-bridged systems. A mixed-valence Fe-II/Fe-III cyanide-bridged coordination polymer, {[Fe(Tp)(CN)(3)](2)Fe(bpe)5H(2)O}(n), which demonstrates a thermally induced charge-transfer phase transition, is described. As a result of the charge transfer during this phase transition, the high-spin state of the whole system does not change to a low-spin state. This result is in contrast to FeCo cyanide-bridged systems that exhibit charge-transfer-induced spin transitions.

TI Initiating an efficient electrocatalyst for water splitting via
   valence configuration of cobalt-iron oxide
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Engineering valence state of active center in non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts is of prime importance to enhance the performance for different catalytic reactions. However, studies on optimized valence configuration with extremely high activity remains a great challenge because of scanty chemical approaches. Herein, a kind of CoFe-oxide nanocubes with tunable valence composition was rationally designed for boosting water splitting electrocatalysis by partially chemical tailoring Prussian blue analogue. The resulting Co2+-rich CoFe-oxide nanocube ((CoFe)-Fe-II-ONC) exhibited higher OER and HER catalytic performance than the well-balanced CoFe-oxide. It demanded overpotentials of only 289 mV and 284 mV to drive a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The DFT calculations revealed that Co Fe-ONC is more favorable for OER and HER since the higher capacity of water adsorption, optimized route for electrons transferring, and lower energy barrier for water dissociation by the active valance configuration.

TI Preparation of K2Fe[Fe(CN)6] nanoparticles by
   improved electrostatic spray assisted precipitation technology as
   potassium-ion battery cathodes
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Prussian blue analogues, which have a stable structural framework and larger ion migration channels, are currently one of the most potential cathodes for potassium ion batteries. However, Prussian blue-based materials are susceptible to preparation conditions, resulting in vacancy defects and crystal water in structures, which seriously restricts the exertion of electrochemical properties. Herein, a novel preparation technology-an electrostatic spray assisted coprecipitation way protected by inert atmosphere is proposed and applied to the synthesis of K2Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] materials. The effects of preparation process on the crystallinity, microstructure and potassium storage performances of K2Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] are systematically discussed. The results prove that K2Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] synthesized by the new preparation process has good crystallinity (K1.56Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.89.square 11.1.86) H2O), small particle size (similar to 20 nm) and high specific surface area (104.31 m(2) g(-1)), and finally exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, including an superb cycling stability of 89 mAh g(-1) after 503 cycles at 0.5 C and rate capability of 82 mAh g(-1) at 10 C. In addition, this preparation technology also provides a new strategy for the microstructure and performance optimization of other Prussian blue-based materials. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Small size porous NiO/NiFe2O4 nanocubes derived from Ni-Fe bimetallic
   metal-organic frameworks for fast volatile organic compounds detection
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Despite the vital role of heterojunction construction in optimizing the performance of the MOS-based gas sensor, the one-step synthesis of uniformly dispersed miniaturized heterostructures remains a challenge. In this study, bimetallic MOFs Ni-Fe PBA of small size (about 75 nm) was prepared by a simple coprecipitation method. Taking it as the self-sacrificial model, we obtained NiO/NiFe2O4 nanocubes with porous, small-sized, uniform distributed heterostructure (about 56 nm). The gas-sensitive test results show that the NiO/NiFe2O4 materials exhibit ptype gas-sensitive behavior and have good gas-sensitive property to a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) gases (acetone, ethyl acetate, aniline, triethylamine, ethanol, formaldehyde, toluene, and trimethylamine). In particular, the NiO/NiFe2O4 sensor has fast response/recovery characteristics to 100 ppm VOCs gases at low operating temperature (170 celcius), and the response/recovery times of several representative VOCs such as acetone, ethyl acetate, triethylamine and toluene were 12.8 s/15.6 s, 26 s/15.8 s, 11.2 s/14.4 s, 19.6 s/31.8 s, respectively. The superior response of porous NiO/NiFe2O4 nanocubes towards VOCs is attributed to the large specific surface area of the porosity and the uniformly dispersed heterostructure, which facilitate gas transport and exposure of active sites.

TI Tunable phosphorization degree of
   CoxPy@N,P-doped carbon as a
   highly-active bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air
   batteries
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The commercial development of rechargeable metal-air batteries urgently requires us to investigate low-cost, durable and highly effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, bifunctional electrocatalysts require different active sites, which inevitably increase the complexity of electrocatalyst construction. In this study, bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts are prepared using CoxPy (x = 1 or 2, y = 0 or 1, i.e., Co, CoP and Co2P) nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on a N,P-doped porous carbon framework (CoxPy@NPPC) through carbonizing the mixture of a melamine-phytic acid supermolecular aggregate (MPSA) and a CoCo-Prussian blue analogue (CoCo-PBA) after grinding in one step. By controlling the proportion of CoCo-PBA and MPSA, the stoichiometric proportion of CoxPy nanoparticles can be reasonably designed to achieve controllable preparation. The prepared cobalt-based nanocatalysts with different degrees of phosphorization (DoP) can be used for the OER and ORR. It is found that the as-synthesized Co2P@NPPC exhibits the most excellent ORR/OER bifunctional activity among the CoxPy@NPPC analogues, with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V and an overpotential of 320 mV for the ORR and OER at 10 mA cm(-2). The reversible oxygen electrode index (Delta E = E-j10 - E-1/2) can reach similar to 0.70 V. The assembled zinc-air battery based on Co2P@NPPC delivers a wonderful charge-discharge stability with a recharge voltage of similar to 2.05 V and a discharge voltage of similar to 1.09 V for 160 h at 10 mA cm(-2) and a peak power density of 226 mW cm(-2), which is superior to Pt/C + RuO2 and most of the CoxPy-based electrodes that have been reported. At the same time, this study provides an alternative and simple phosphating strategy for improving the catalytic activity of bifunctional electrocatalysts.

TI Low defects potassium cobalt hexacyanoferrate as a superior cathode for
   aqueous potassium ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Aqueous alkali ion batteries attract increasing attention due to their merits of being safety, eco-friendly and low cost. Nevertheless, their development is hindered by the lack of suitable electrode materials with high capacity and cycling stability. As promising candidates, Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) are particularly attractive cathode materials in the energy storage field for their excellent electrochemical properties. Co-based PBAs (CoHCF) have relatively high discharge plateau, high theoretical capacity and good cycle performance. The potassium storage mechanism of CoHCF is still unclear and lacks study. Herein, a novel low-defect CoHCF was synthesized by a feasible coprecipitation method. When applied in aqueous potassium ion batteries (AKIBs), the two-electron-transfer process is observed clearly. The CoHCF electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 83.6 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 20 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles. In addition, excellent rate performance and long cycling stability at 600 mA g(-1) were obtained. The structural evolution and reaction mechanism of CoHCF upon K+ extraction/insertion were visibly characterized by ex situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. The results demonstrate a new strategy for the development of AKIB cathodes with excellent electrochemical performance.

TI CoFe2O4 nanoparticles@N-doped carbon coupled with

SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Developing high-performance nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for efficient water splitting. Therefore, the reasonable design principle of catalyst, leading to high activity catalytic center and improving the accessibility of active sites, is undoubtedly crucial. Here, we used a kind of Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) nanoparticles to anchor the nitrogen-carbon doped CoFe2O4 (CoFe2O4@NC) species to reduced graphene oxide aerogels as OER catalysts. The strong interaction between nanosized CoFe2O4@NC and the graphitic carbon shell led to synergistic effects in the OER, and the protection of the carbon shell guaranteed stability of the catalyst. As a result, the aerogel electrocatalyst exhibits more excellent activity and stability than the most advanced RuO2 catalyst in OER under the same mass load in alkaline medium. It shows smaller overpotential of 250 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a continuous working time of more than 70 hours.

TI Selective removal of ammonium ions with transition metal
   hexacyanoferrate (MHCF) electrodes
SO DESALINATION
AB This study investigated the potential of using transition metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCF) to selectively capture NH4+ over Na+ in brine for nutrient recovery from wastewater. The electrochemical characteristics of five different MHCF (M is Ni, Cu, Fe, Co or Zn), known as Prussian blue analogues (PBA), was investigated using a hybrid capacitive deionization device, and their desalting capacity, stability and energy consumption were evaluated. By adjusting the mass ratio of electrodes, applied voltage, and ion concentration, the relationship between NH4+ removal and selectivity was explored. Results showed that all five MHCF electrodes exhibited high selectivity (> 4) for NH4+ over Na+, but the selectivity is not stable due to comprehensive factors (such as the structural stability of electrode, solution composition, and current density, etc.). Among them, the NiHCF electrode showing the best performance in terms of specific desalination capacity (similar to 1.23 mmol/g), charge efficiency (>80%), and stability (82.5% capacity retention after 50 cycles). This study demonstrates that PBA has promising potential as NH4+ selective electrodes for nutrient removal and recovery in wastewater.

TI Shape control of core-shell MOF@MOF and derived MOF nanocages via
   ion modulation in a one-pot strategy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Core-shell MOF@MOF structures are good candidates for the design of diverse multifunctional materials with intriguing properties. Conventional seed-induced growth procedures to create MOF@MOF usually suffer from limitations including the unavoidable nucleation/growth of the shell MOF in solution and the inevitable agglomeration of seeds. For the first time, an ion-modulation (Fe3+ as the indicator) strategy is demonstrated to realize one-pot synthesis of monodisperse MOF@MOF composed of two distinct Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). It utilized a finite amount of Fe3+ to induce a partial phase transition and generate new PBA nanoparticles epitaxially growing on the original PBA core. The as-prepared PBA@PBA with a distinct morphology, readily tunable by controlling the dose of dopant ions, can serve as a template for the creation of PBA nanocages with uncommon and tunable shapes for efficient phenol scavenging. The findings here pave the way for the rational design of MOFs with high complexity, good structural flexibility, and desirable activity.

TI Le Chatelier's principle enables stable and sustainable aqueous
   sodium/magnesium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogue (PBA) based aqueous batteries assembled with organic materials are an up-and-coming and promising technology for less demanding applications. By avoiding scarce, costly, and toxic transition metals (e.g. Ni/Co/Cu), the technology may become low-cost, more environmentally benign, and also safer than today's alternatives. Here we rely on a PBA using the FeII/III redox pair together with aqueous low-to-medium concentrated fluorine/perchlorate-free electrolytes and organic materials to create long-term performant cells. The performance in terms of capacity, coulombic efficiency, cell voltage, and energy density are all comparable with previously reported aqueous PBA-based batteries, while the cycling performance is substantially improved by practically implementing Le Chatelier's principle. Additionally, we investigate the redox process(es) and find no proof for any proton storage, but that both Na+ and Mg2+ likely are active, why we classify it as an aqueous Na/Mg-ion battery.
   We present a new Prussian blue analogue based aqueous battery that by three salts in low-to-medium concentrations in the electrolyte substantially enhances the cycling performance and give promise for low-cost and sustainable energy storage.

To this end, an efficient approach to enhance rate and cycling performance by introducing an ordered bicontinuous porous structure into cathode materials of SIBs is demonstrated. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are selected because they are recognized as a type of most promising SIB cathode materials. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ ions diffusion as well as the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBAs exhibit excellent rate capability (80 mAh g(-1) at 2.5 A g(-1)) and ultralong cycling life (>3000 circulations at 0.5 A g(-1)), reaching the top performance of the reported PBA-based cathode materials. This study opens a new avenue for boosting sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in electrodes of rechargeable batteries and also provides a new paradigm for solving the dilemma that electrodes' failure due to high-stress concentration upon ion storage.

TI Paving the Way toward Highly Efficient, High-Energy Potassium-Ion
   Batteries with Ionic Liquid Electrolytes
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Potassium-ion batteries (KIB) are a promising complementary technology to lithium-ion batteries because of the comparative abundance and affordability of potassium. Currently, the most promising KIB chemistry consists of a potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMF) cathode, a Prussian blue analog, and a graphite anode (723 W h l(-1) and 359 W h kg(-1) at 3.6 V). No electrolyte has yet been formulated that is concurrently stable at the high operating potential of KMF (4.02 V vs K+/K) and compatible with K+ intercalation into graphite, currently the most critical hurdle to adoption. Here, we combine a KMF cathode and a graphite anode with a KFSI in Pyr(1,3)FSI ionic liquid electrolyte for the first time and show unprecedented performance. We use high-throughput techniques to optimize the KMF morphology for operation in this electrolyte system, achieving 119 mA h g(-1) at 4 V vs K+/K and a Coulombic efficiency of >99.3%. In the same ionic liquid electrolyte, graphite shows excellent electrochemical performance and we demonstrate reversible cycling by operando X-ray diffraction. These results are a significant and essential step forward toward viable potassium-ion batteries.

TI Redox Targeting-Based Vanadium Redox-Flow Battery
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB The low energy density and narrow operating temperature window besides the relatively high cost of the vanadium redox-flow battery (VRB) severely hinder its commercial deployment. Herein, in conjunction with low-concentration VO2+/VO2+ catholyte, we introduce a redox targeting-based VRB (RT-VRB) system in which a Prussian blue analogue (PBA), (VO)(6)[Fe(CN)(6)](3), is employed as a capacity booster to address the above issues. The charges are reversibly stored in the PBA loaded in the cathodic tank via a redox-targeting reaction with the VO2+/VO2+. Therefore, the concentration of catholyte has been reduced to 0.6 M without sacrificing the capacity. This provides ample room to broaden the operating temperature window of a RT-VRB relative to a conventional VRB. The theoretical volumetric capacity of the PBA could reach 135 Ah/L, which is more than 3 times that of VRB. We anticipate that the RT-VRB system demonstrated here would give credible impetus for VRB chemistry for robust and high-density energy storage applications.

   for Confined Soft Chemistry
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Mesoporous silica monoliths with various ordered nanostructures containing transition metal M2+ cations in variable amounts were elaborated and studied. A phase diagram depicting the different phases as a function of the M2+ salt/tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and surfactant P123/TMOS ratios was established. Thermal treatment resulted in mesoporous monoliths containing isolated, accessible M2+ species or condensed metal oxides, hydroxides, and salts, depending on the strength of the interactions between the metal species and the ethylene oxide units of P123. The ordered mesoporosity of the monoliths containing accessible M2+ ions was used as a nanoreactor for the elaboration of various transition metal compounds (Prussian blue analogues, Hofmann compounds, metal-organic frameworks), and this opens the way to the elaboration of a large range of nanoparticles of multifunctional materials.

TI High-Voltage Potassium Hexacyanoferrate Cathode via High-Entropy and
   Potassium Incorporation for Stable Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS NANO
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) used as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathodes are usually the focus of attention due to their three-dimensional open frame and high theoretical capacity. Nonetheless, the disadvantages of a low working voltage and inferior structural stability of PBAs prevent their further applications. Herein, we propose constructing the K-x(MnFeCoNiCu)[Fe(CN)(6)] (HE-K-PBA) cathode by high-entropy and potassium incorporation strategy to simultaneously realize high working voltage and cycling stability. The reaction mechanism of metal cations in HE-K-PBA are revealed by synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ Raman spectra. We also investigate the entropy stabilization mechanism via finite element simulation, demonstrating that HE-K-PBA with small von Mises stress and weak structure strain can significantly mitigate the structural distortion. Benefit from the stable structure and everlasting K+ (de)intercalation, the HE-K-PBA delivers high output voltage (3.46 V), good reversible capacity (120.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.01 A g(-1)), and capacity retention of 90.4% after 1700 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1). Moreover, the assembled full cell and all-solid-state batteries with a stable median voltage of 3.29 V over 3000 cycles further demonstrate the application prospects of the HE-K-PBA cathode.

TI Electrochemical Li-Ion Intercalation in Octacyanotungstate-Bridged
   Coordination Polymer with Evidence of Three Magnetic Regimes
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Discovery of novel compounds capable of electrochemical ion intercalation is a primary step toward development of advanced electrochemical devices such as batteries. Although cyano-bridged coordination polymers including Prussian blue analogues have been intensively investigated as ion intercalation materials, the solid-state electrochemistry of the octacyanotungstate-bridged coordination polymer has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that an octacyanotungstate-bridged coordination polymer Tb(H2O)(5)[W(CN)(8)] operates as a Li+-ion intercalation electrode material. The detailed magnetic measurements reveal that the tunable amount of intercalated Li+ ion in the solid-state redox reaction between paramagnetic [W-V(CN)(8)](3-) and diamagnetic [W-IV(CN)(8)](4-) in the framework enables the electrochemical control of different magnetic regimes. While the initial ferromagnetic long-range ordering is irreversibly lost upon lithium insertion, electrochemical switching between paramagnetic and short-range ordering regimes can be achieved.

TI Dual-strategy of Cu-doping and O3 biphasic structure enables Fe/Mn-based
   layered oxide for high-performance sodium-ion batteries cathode
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB O3-type Fe/Mn-based layered oxides are considered as the competitive cathode materials for sodium-ion bat-teries because of environmental friendly metal elements and low cost. However, a lower capacity, poor cycling stability and irreversible phase transitions hinder their commercial application. Herein, the Cu-doped O3 biphasic Na[Mn0.6Fe0.4](1-x)CuxO2 (NFMCu-x) layered oxides are successfully synthesized by high temperature calcination using Fe/Mn-based Prussian blue analogues as precursor. The results indicate that the different stoichiometric of Cu2+ substitution in P2 NaMn0.6Fe0.4O2 can cause the transformation of P2 phase to O3 monophase or O3 biphase. The NFMCu-x samples exhibit O3 monophase at x = 0.1, 0.15, while O3 biphase coexists in the compound at x = 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of Cu-doping and O3 biphasic structure, the optimized O3 biphasic NaMn0.48Fe0.32Cu0.2O2 exhibits a high Na + diffusion coefficient and an excellent sodium storage performance with a high discharge specific capacity of 103.76 mAh g-1 at 24 mA g-1 and good capacity retention of 82.9% after 100 cycles. Moreover, Cu-doped O3 biphasic NaMn0.48-Fe0.32Cu0.2O2 features an excellent air stability. Thus, this work proposes a strategy in development of O3 Fe/Mn-based layered oxide as high-performance cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.

TI Photo-controlled exchange bias in CoO@Co-Fe PBA core-shell
   heterostructures
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Regulating the exchange bias (EB) effect via an external field allows one to effectively tailor the properties of spin-valve-based spintronic devices. However, as a reliable way to manipulate the magnetic properties of materials, there have been few reports on the effect of light irradiation on the EB effect so far. In this work, a non-volatile light-tunable EB effect is achieved in a well-designed CoO and CoFe Prussian blue analogue core-shell structure (CoO@Co-Fe PBA), where the antiferromagnetic CoO has a large anisotropy, and the molecular magnet Co-Fe PBA is photosensitive. The EB field of this hybrid can be reduced by similar to 50% after irradiation for 20 minutes, and the photo-induced change can be further increased by extending the irradiation time. In addition, the switching of the two EB effect states can be successfully implemented by switching red and blue light irradiation. Herein, this interesting photo-controlled EB effect is attributed to the change in the magnetization of the photosensitive Co-Fe PBA shell after light radiation, and the change is achieved by manipulating the number of Fe-III-Co-II magnetic pairs in the shell by incident light. Apparently, this striking light-controlled EB effect opens up new prospects for the design of new-generation optoelectronic devices.

TI Diffusion-free Grotthuss topochemistry for high-rate and long-life
   proton batteries
SO NATURE ENERGY
AB The design of Faradaic battery electrodes that exhibit high rate capability and long cycle life equivalent to those of the electrodes of electrical double-layer capacitors is a big challenge. Here we report a strategy to fill this performance gap using the concept of Grotthuss proton conduction, in which proton transfer takes place by means of concerted cleavage and formation of O-H bonds in a hydrogen-bonding network. We show that in a hydrated Prussian blue analogue (Turnbull's blue) the abundant lattice water molecules with a contiguous hydrogen-bonding network facilitate Grotthuss proton conduction during redox reactions. When using it as a battery electrode, we find high-rate behaviours at 4,000 C (380 Ag-1, 508 mA cm(-2)), and a long cycling life of 0.73 million cycles. These results for diffusion-free Grotthuss topochemistry of protons, in contrast to orthodox battery electrochemistry, which requires ion diffusion inside electrodes, indicate a potential direction to revolutionize electrochemical energy storage for high-power applications.

AB Cyano-bridged coordination polymers have attracted wide interest owing to their promise in various applications such as molecular magnets, information storage, bio-sensing, electrochromism, nanomedicine, catalysis, water treatment, and energy storage and conversion. Inspired by the great success of nanoengineering in noble metals and semiconductors, nanoarchitectonics of these cyano-bridged coordination polymers has been actively explored for hunting new properties or functions with significant progress in understanding their crystallization habit and chemical stability. Although comprehensive information about the nanoarchitectonics of cyano-bridged coordination polymers remains poorly elucidated, a systematic overview of recent advances in this area is strongly needed in order to make further progress on the basis of current developments. In this review, we intend to summarize the wet-chemical manipulation strategies based on controlled crystallization and etching for nanostructuration of cyano-bridged coordination polymers. Some examples of the relationship between the nanoarchitecture and the properties of the cyano-bridged coordination polymers will be given.

However, their adoption is significantly hampered by several issues, especially in terms of sluggish kinetics and capacity retention during cycling. Herein, flexible Prussian blue analogue FeFe(CN)(6)/carbon cloth composites are synthesized using low temperature strategies and utilized as a potential host for sodium ion insertion.

Most significantly, this low-cost, scalable and low-temperature synthesis provides guidance for the design of other flexible materials that could have applications in wearable electronics, energy storage and conversion devices.

TI Defect-rich bimetallic yolk-shell metal-cyanide frameworks as efficient

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The rational design and construction of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts with high activity and robust durability for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) have aroused immense interest in the past decades, but challenges remain. Herein, a reduction-induced dissolution-recrystallization (RIDR) strategy was developed to fabricate a defect-rich yolk-shell Prussian-blue analogue (YS-PBA) by a solvothermal process in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The experimental result indicated that the defect-rich YS-PBA was formed via phase transformation from Co-3[Fe-III(CN)(6)](2) to Co2FeII(CN)(6) induced by the reduction potential of the IPA-PVP couple. The newly synthesized YS-PBA exhibited outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 293 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term durability (120 h) in alkaline media. Both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results unveiled that the defects formed in YS-PBA cause a dramatic positive effect on the improvement of the OER activity.

TI Understanding the Structural Evolution and Lattice Water Movement for
   Rhombohedral Nickel Hexacyanoferrate upon Sodium Migration
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been regarded as prospective cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to tunable chemical composition and structure. Herein, a high-performance rhombohedral nickel hexacyanoferrate is synthesized via a controllable low-temperature reaction process. It can deliver impressive capacity retention of 87.8% after 10 000 cycles at 10C and high rate discharge capacity of 53 mAh g(-1) at 40C. According to the structural evolution and lattice water movement, superior electrochemical performance is ascribed to small lattice alteration and high reversibility of rhombohedral-cubic transition upon Na+ insertion/extraction. The environment information of local- and long-range structure evolution is revealed by ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). Importantly, lattice water movement during cycling by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements offers an experimental validation about Na+ nonlinear migration path, as well as the accumulative lattice distortion effect from large-size Na(OH2)(+) unit. The revealed mechanism points out the modified path for PBAs.

TI A low-strain metal organic framework for ultra-stable and long-life
   sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB As sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) attract more attention, various host materials allowing Na-ions insertion/extraction are being developed. Among them, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), as typical metal organic frameworks, are regarded as promising cathodes for SIBs because of their open frame structure and simple synthesis process. However, the presence of [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies and crystal water in PBA framework usually induce poor electrochemical performance. Herein, high quality Na-rich monoclinic nickel hexacyanoferrate Na1.95Ni[Fe (CN)(6)](0.89)center dot 2.87H(2)O with nanocubes morphology (NiHCF-NCs) has been prepared through a simple diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid disodium (Na(2)DTPA)-assisted coprecipitation strategy. Benefiting from inhibiting defects and low-strain sodium storage mechanism, as-obtained NiHCF-NCs exhibits superior electrochemical properties in terms of high capacity (81.3 mAh g(-1)), excellent rate capability (64.5 mAh g(-1) at 4000 mA g(-1)), and outstanding cycle performance (97.1% capacity retention over 2000 cycles). Moreover, full-cell assembled with NiHCF-NCs cathode and NaTi2(PO4)(3)@C anode presents competitive behaviors of good rate capability and ultra-long cycle lifespan over 5000 cycles, greatly promoting the development of SIBs in practical application.

TI Effects of interstitial water and alkali cations on the expansion,
   intercalation potential, and orbital coupling of nickel hexacyanoferrate
   from first principles
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are an important material class for aqueous electrochemical separations and energy storage owing to their ability to reversibly intercalate monovalent cations. However, incorporating interstitial H2O molecules in the ab initio study of PBAs is technically challenging, though essential to understanding the interactions between interstitial water, interstitial cations, and the framework lattice that affect intercalation potential and cation intercalation selectivity. Accordingly, we introduce and use a method that combines the efficiency of machine-learning models with the accuracy of ab initio calculations to elucidate mechanisms of (1) lattice expansion upon intercalation of cations of different sizes, (2) selectivity bias toward intercalating hydrophobic cations of large size, and (3) semiconductor-conductor transitions from anhydrous to hydrated lattices. We analyze the PBA nickel hexacyanoferrate [NiFe(CN)(6)] due to its structural stability and electrochemical activity in aqueous electrolytes. Here, grand potential analysis is used to determine the equilibrium degree of hydration for a given intercalated cation (Na+, K+, or Cs+) and NiFe(CN)(6) oxidation state based on pressure-equilibrated structures determined with the aid of machine learning and simulated annealing. The results imply new directions for the rational design of future cation-intercalation electrode materials that optimize performance in various electrochemical applications, and they demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate calculation framework to predict the properties of PBA lattices accurately.

TI Garnet-Type Zinc Hexacyanoferrates as Lithium, Sodium, and Potassium
   Solid Electrolytes
SO BATTERIES-BASEL
AB Sodium-ion batteries offer an attractive alternative to lithium-based chemistries due to the lower cost and abundance of sodium compared to lithium. Using solid electrolytes instead of liquid ones in such batteries may help improve safety and energy density, but they need to combine easy processing with high stability toward the electrodes. Herein, we describe a new class of solid electrolytes that are accessible by room-temperature, aqueous synthesis. The materials exhibit a garnet-type zinc hexacyanoferrate framework with large diffusion channels for alkaline ions. Specifically, they show superionic behavior and allow for facile processing into pellets. We compare the structure, stability, and transport properties of lithium-, sodium-, and potassium-containing zinc hexacyanoferrates and find that Na2Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 achieves the highest ionic conductivity of up to 0.21 mS/cm at room temperature. In addition, the electrochemical performance and stability of the latter solid electrolyte are examined in solid-state sodium-ion batteries.

TI In Situ Exfoliation Growth Strategy Realizing Controlled Synthesis of 3D
   to 2D MOF Materials as High-Performance Electrochemical Biosensors
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with large surface area, ultrathin thickness, and highly accessible active sites have attracted great research attention. Developing efficient approaches to realize the controllable synthesis of well-defined 2D MOFs with a specific composition and morphology is critical. However, it is still a significant challenge to construct thin and uniform 2D MOF nanosheets and resolve the reagglomeration as well as poor stability of target 2D MOF products. Here, an "in situ exfoliation growth" strategy is proposed, where a one-step synthetic process can realize the successful fabrication of PBA/MIL-53(NiFe)/NF nanosheets on the surface of nickel foam (NF) via in situ conversion and exfoliation growth strategies. The PBA/MIL-53(NiFe)/NF nanosheets combine the individual advantages of MOFs, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), and 2D materials. As expected, the resulting PBA/MIL-53(NiFe)/NF as a glucose electrode exhibits an extremely high sensitivity of 25.74 mA mM(-1) cm(-2) in a very wide concentration range of 180 nM to 4.8 mu M. The present exciting work provides a simple and effective strategy for the construction of high-performance nonenzymatic glucose electrochemical biosensors.

TI Valence switching of bismuth in ferricyanide as cathode materials for
   sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, and the key to their widespread use lies in finding efficient and cost-effective cathode materials. Ferricyanides have emerged as promising candidates for SIBs cathodes due to their low cost and open channel structure allowing for favorable ion and electron transport. However, traditional ferricyanides such as Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs (PBAs) have a limited two-electron transfer capacity, which hampers their practical application. Bi-based ferricyanide materials with multiple valence states, low toxicity and abundant resources are attractive for electrochemical reactions and enable multiple electron transfers to develop high-capacity cathode materials. In this study, we synthesized a rod-like BiHCF center dot 4H(2)O sample using a simple coprecipitation method. After dehydration, the rodlike BiHCF compounds with a robust framework and reduced lattice water defects demonstrated good electrochemical performance in SIBs. The rod-like BiHCF electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 221 mAh g(-1) at 20 mA g(-1) based on a three-electron transfer of Bi3+/Bi-0. A full SIBs composed of a BiHCF cathode and Bi anode demonstrated acceptable performance, indicating potential for practical applications. This work provides valuable insights into the development of redox-active site substitution strategies for high performance positive electrode materials in SIBs.

TI Fabrication of a novel non-enzymatic glucose sensor based on ruthenium
   supported by a combination of PBA nanocubes and MOF nanosheets
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB The development of novel catalysts with high catalytic activity is of high importance of electrochemical non-enzymatic glucose sensing. Herein, a sensitive non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor (Ru@NiCo-MOF/NiFePBA) has been synthesized using a fast, simple and eco-friendly method. The high stability of PBA and the large specific surface area (two-dimensional nanosheet structure) of MOF support the excellent electrochemical performance, while the incorporation of the highly active metal Ru enhances the electrochemical activity even more. The results reveal that the sensitivities of the sensor are 1070.77 and 487.62 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), corresponding to linear ranges of 0.01-0.67 mM and 0.67-5.07 mM, respectively. Meanwhile, the sensor has a low detection limit (0.446 mu M) and a short response time (2 s), making it a strong candidate for non-enzymatic glucose sensors. The successful detection of glucose in saliva further demonstrates its potential for practical applications. Therefore, Ru@NiCo-MOF/NiFe-PBA will make an impact in the field of glucose monitoring and detection.

TI Coordination-assisted synthesis of iron-incorporated cobalt oxide
   nanoplates for enhanced oxygen evolution
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a vital role in green technologies including water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction. As promising alternatives of noble metals-based OER electrocatalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2, the OER performance of nanostructured Co-based materials is far from satisfactory. In this report, a coordination-assisted etching strategy is proposed to incorporate iron into cobalt oxide porous nanoplates, producing composite nanostructures with optimized Co:Fe ratio that manifest significantly enhanced OER performance (an overpotential of 304 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) as well as a low Tafel slope of 38 mV/dec). The enhancement can be attributed to the modulated electronic structure of cobalt, favorable absorption energy of OER intermediates, and the formation of more oxygen vacancies. This work highlights the importance of rational integration of iron with cobalt for optimal electrocatalytic performance enabled by the coordination-assisted etching strategy, providing more opportunities for the design and synthesis of mixed metal electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.

TI Self-template synthesis of PBA/MOF hollow nanocubes for aqueous battery
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Hollow nanostructures possess low density, high specific surface area and short mass and charge transport lengths, which offer promising potential for advanced energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, a facile self-templating method is presented for the synthesis of hollow nanocube composites consisting of Prussian blue analogue and metal-organic framework (PBA/MOF HNCs). The growth process of the PBA/MOF HNCs was studied and indicated that the in-situ formation of MOF shell on the surface of pristine PBA by coordination effect of 2, 5-hydroxyterephthalic acid, while the inner structure was gradually consumed to generate void spaces. Benefits to its unique hierarchical pore features and large surface area that provide abundant interfacial contact with electrolyte and facilitate the exposure of active sites and ions transport, the PBA/MOF HNCs exhibit superior performance compared to pristine PBA nanocube when used as the cathode material for an aqueous battery. Specifically, the assembled NiCoFe-PBA/MOF HNCs // Zn battery showed a maximum energy density reached 0.22 mWh cm-(- 2 )(88 Wh kg-( 1) ) and the peak power density of 32.68 mW cm(- 2) (13.07 kW kg-( 1) ), and excellent stability over 1000 cycles in aqueous electrolytes. This work provides new insights into the design of metal-organic hybrid hollow nanomaterials for efficient electrochemical devices.

TI Highly Resolved Mn Kβ Emission: A Potential Probe in Laboratory
   for Analysis of Ligand Coordination around Mn Atoms in Gels and
   Solutions
SO ANALYTICAL SCIENCES
AB Mn K beta spectra of Mn, MnO, MnSO4 center dot H2O, KMnO4, 0.50 M MnSO4 aqueous solution, and the precipitation bands of MnFe-based Prussian blue analogs formed in 2.4 wt.% agarose gel ("Gel") were measured using a laboratory-use X-ray setup with similar to 2.6 eV instrumental resolution, which comprises a cylindrically bent Si (400) crystal monochromator and a spherically bent Ge (440) crystal analyzer. The oxidation-state dependent shift of the Mn K beta(1,3) peak (similar to 1 eV) was clearly observed for Mn, MnO, and KMnO4, confirming that the employed setup can acquire the key features of Mn K beta spectra. The Mn K beta spectra of MnSO4 center dot H2O, the 0.50 M solution, and Gel exhibited small but distinguishable differences, whereas the spectra acquired at two positions in Gel were almost the same. These results suggest that highly resolved Mn K beta spectra can be helpful for assessing ligand coordination around Mn atoms in gels and solutions.

TI Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Gel Electrocatalyst for Stable Acidic Water
   Oxidation
SO ACS NANO
AB Water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) are essential to electrochemical hydrogen production, but (electro)chemical instability remains a critical issue for WOCs especially under acidic conditions. Here we present a hybrid organic-inorganic polymeric dual network gel (DN gel) electrocatalyst based on earth-abundant elements via in situ oxidative polymerization of polypyrrole and simultaneous cyano-polymerization for efficient acidic water oxidation. X-ray absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectra reveal a synergistic interplay between the inorganic polymer and the organic conductive polymer in producing a favorable local coordination environment, further supported by the DFT calculation. The DN gel electrocatalyst exhibits highly active and stable catalytic activity for oxygen evolution in the pH = 0 electrolyte, with no noticeable degradation after more than 3000 cycles. This work presents an alternative insight into developing highly active and robust WOCs as promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts in strong acids.

TI CoP Nanoframes as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall
   Water Splitting
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB Transition-metal phosphides have been shown to be promising electrocatalysts in water for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To maximize reactivity toward both entails limiting the catalyst size while maintaining reactivity and avoiding aggregation. Frame-like hollow nanostructures (nanoframes) provide the required open structure with sufficient channels into the interior volume. We demonstrate here the design and synthesis of CoP nanoframes (CoP NFs) by a strategy involving precipitation, chemical etching, and low-temperature phosphidation steps. It results in impressive bifunctional catalytic activities for both HER and OER and consequently enables a highly efficient water electrolyzer with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) driven by a cell voltage of only 1.65 V. The strategy has been generalized for the preparation of nanoframe Co dichalcogenides CoX2 NFs, with X = S, Se, and Te. The results of electrochemical measurements, supported by density functional theory calculations, show that HER catalytic activities for the series follow the sequence: CoP NFs > CoSe2 NFs > CoS2 NFs > CoTe2 NFs.

TI Fe<SUP>HS</SUP> vacancies in a Prussian white cathode leads to enhanced
   Fe<SUP>LS</SUP> activity and electrode kinetics for boosted
   K<SUP>+</SUP> storage
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Fe-based Prussian white (PW) is considered a superior cathode material for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) because of its three-dimensional open framework structure, high potassium content, and low cost; however, a dramatic distortion of low-spin (LS) Fe-C octahedra typically occurs upon the extraction of second K+, leading to a deteriorated structure as well as poor rate and cycling performance, thus limiting their practical applications. In this work, Fe-HS vacancies were successfully incorporated into the lattice structure of PW by simply controlling synthesis temperatures in the presence of the chelating agent potassium citrate, which was confirmed by a series of structural characterizations. A low reaction temperature is found to suppress the incorporation of Fe into the PW structure and therefore leads to the formation of more Fe-HS vacancies. As a result, a sample synthesized at the lowest temperature (0 degrees C) exhibits a more prominent charge-discharge plateau at a high potential region that corresponds to the enhanced activity of Fe-LS and best K+ storage properties, including a reversible capacity of 117.2 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 30 mA g(-1), 80.7% capacity retention at 10C after 1000 cycles, and excellent rate capability. Kinetic analysis and impedance spectroscopy clearly revealed enhanced charge transfer/ion diffusion and a stable host structure upon cycling for the samples synthesized at lower temperatures, further demonstrating the critical role of Fe-HS vacancies for efficient K+ storage. In general, this work provides an efficient and simple strategy to create cation vacancies in the PW cathode, which enables the development of high-performance potassium-ion batteries and can be extended to other related energy storage systems.

TI Hierarchical porous hollow FeFe(CN)6 nanospheres wrapped with
   I-doped graphene as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Hierarchical porous hollow FeFe(CN)(6) nanospheres were synthesized via a facile anisotropic chemical etching route at different temperatures. Herein, we integrated these FeFe(CN)(6) nanospheres and conductive iodine-doped graphene (IG) into a lithium-ion battery (LIB) system, FeFe(CN)(6)@IG. The hollow Prussian-blue type FeFe(CN)(6) nanospheres with an average particle size of 230 nm are uniformly and tightly encapsulated by IG sheets. As an anode material for LIBs, the fabricated FeFe(CN)(6)@IG exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate properties, and superior cycling stability. A reversible capacity can be maintained at 709 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1). Even at a current rate of 2000 mA g(-1), the capacity could reach 473 mA h g(-1). This facile fabrication strategy may pave the way for constructing high performance Prussian blue-based anode materials for potential application in advanced lithium-ion batteries.

TI CoSe2@ carbon composite with open, superlarge voids for improved
   supercapacitor performance
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB The presence of open, superlarge voids and abundant pore structure has been shown to have positive effects on the performance of supercapacitors. In this study, Co-Co-PBA was used as the skeleton material, and F127/P123 was self-supported on its surface using a double-template method. Subsequently, the material was carbonized in a controlled manner to obtain a carbon coating on the CoSe2 core. The resulting material possessed open, superlarge voids, micropore, and a specific surface area of 3193 m2 g � 1. In electrochemical performance tests, the fabricated composite material demonstrated favourable characteristics, facilitating electrolyte penetration and providing abundant active sites. By optimizing the surface morphology of the carbon shell, we successfully enhanced the electrochemical properties of the material, offering potential opportunities for its application in the field of supercapacitors as well as for optimizing derivatives of other framework materials.

TI Rechargeable aqueous aluminum-FeFe(CN)6 battery with
   artificial interphase through deep eutectic solution
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB The application needs of small electronic devices and large-scale power grid storage continuously promote the development of a new battery energy system. Rechargeable metal batteries based on aluminum (Al) are of enormous potential due to the abundant Al reserves, the trivalent charge carrier, high theoretical specific capacity (2980 mAh/g), and volumetric energy density (8046 mAh/cm(3)). However, the passivating oxide layer on the surface of the Al anode blocks the migration of electrons and ions, resulting in the operation difficulty and irreversibility of aluminum-based batteries. Herein we treated Al anode with a deep eutectic solution (DES) and constructed stable solid interface interphase on its surface, which can effectively prevent surface passivation, improve the chemical properties of the interface, promote ion transfer, and enable aqueous Al batteries with superior electrochemical performance. The assembled symmetric cells with treat Al (TAl) can cycle for more than 300 h with a low overpotential (similar to 0.2 V). The TAl anode coupling with the FPB cathode material to assemble the full cells based on the aqueous electrolyte system can deliver a high discharge capacity of 85 mAh/g and exhibit capacity retention of 58 mAh/g after 150 cycles and an average coulombic efficiency of 97.1% at a current density of 100 mA/g. This work provides a novel surface modification strategy of Al metal anode and demonstrates high stability and cost-effective aqueous Al metal battery system, which suggest the significance for the commercialization of Al-metal batteries and their applications in large-scale energy store.

TI An electrochemical biosensor based on CuFe PBA/MoS2 nanocomposites for
   stable and sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide and carcinoembryonic
   antigen
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB An increasing number of electrochemical biosensors have been constructed to detect single bioactive sub-stances with high sensitivity, but not multiple bioactive substances with different properties. Therefore, we incorporated Cu and Fe elements into Prussian blue to form Prussian blue analogues (PBA) to improve the elec-trochemical catalytic activity of Prussian blue. At the same time, MoS2 is used as the material substrate to increase the electrochemical active site of the composite. We have constructed a universal electrochemical sensing platform using composite materials (CuFe PBA/MoS2) as electrode modification materials for detecting two different types of representative cancer biomarkers, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and carcinoembryonic anti-gen (CEA). The universal electrochemical biosensor showed a significant linear response to both H2O2 and CEA with the lowest detection limits of 0.23 & mu;M and 0.01 ng mL-1, respectively, and it had high selectivity, repro-ducibility, and stability. The universal electrochemical biosensor is successfully applied to detect H2O2 released from human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells and CEA expressed on the surface of human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. The developed biosensor has potential in the dynamic detection of the flux of H2O2 and the expression level of CEA from living cells. The high sensitivity of this universal sensor provides a novel strategy for simul-taneously detecting multiple cancer biomarkers.

TI Bimetallic CuCo@Nitrogen/Carbon Nanoparticles as a Cathode Catalyst for
   Magnesium-Air Batteries
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Mg-air batteries are regarded as one of the most promising electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices. Developing high-performance, low-cost and durable non-noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at cathode is extremely critical for promoting the practical applications of Mg-air batteries. The bimetallic M-N-C catalysts possess the superior ORR activity and stability due to the synergetic effect of metal atoms. Herein, prussian blue analogues (PBA) were employed as precursors to prepare bimetallic M-N-C electrocatalysts. The CuCo@N/C and Co@N/C were derived from CuCo-PBA and CoCo-PBA calcined under different temperatures. The bimetallic CuCo@N/C nanoparticles pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C (CuCo@N/C-800) displays superior ORR performances and outstanding stability in alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The primary Mg-air batteries assembled with the CuCo@N/C-800 as the cathode catalyst displays better discharge performances than that of Co@N/C-800. This work provides an effective strategy to synthesize bimetallic and non-noble ORR catalysts for Mg-air batteries.

TI Synthesis of truncated octahedral zinc-doped manganese hexacyanoferrates
   and low-temperature calcination activation for lithium-ion battery
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Owing to their open three-dimensional framework structure, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted increasing interest as anode materials for future lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, some disadvantages, such as inferior stability and short cycle life, hinder its utilization significantly. Hence, we develop a simple method to prepare a unique truncated octahedral ZnMnFe-PBA with exposed {111} crystal facets. The doping of Zn into Mn-based PBA enhances structural stability and improves the electronic conductivity. Meanwhile, low-temperature calcination not only improves the electrochemical activity but also preserves the porosity to enable mass transfer. When the ratio of Mn:Zn is 90:10 and the calcination temperature is 100 degrees C, sample Z10-100 displays high capacity and excellent cycle life (similar to 510.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) , 168.9 mA h g(-1) after 5000 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1) with 99.9% capacity retention). The significant improvements in cycle stability and cycle life are attributable to transition metal ion doping and effective low-temperature calcination activation, which provide a facile approach for the synthesis of low-cost and efficient electrode materials.

TI A simple postsynthetic in-situ cation exchange strategy to construct
   Fe-doped Ni3Se4 nanoarray for enhanced oxygen
   evolution reaction
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB For industrial high-purity green hydrogen production, it is necessary to develop efficient, economical and stable non-precious metal-based alkaline media oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. In this study, a simple stepwise synthesis strategy was proposed to construct a hierarchical MOF-based Prussian blue analogue by Ni-BPDC and derived from it to grow Fe-doped Ni3Se4 in situ on nickel foam (Fe-Ni3Se4/NF) as an efficient and stable alkaline OER electrocatalyst. Fe doping enables better modulation of the electronic structure of Ni(3)Se(4)and increases the number of active sites and electrochemical surface area to improve the OER activity. Fe- Ni3Se4/ NF exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance in 1 M KOH with low overpotential (211 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and small Tafel slope (34.44 mV dec(- 1)), which is superior to that of commercial RuO2 catalysts. Its electrochemical characteristics are stable at 10 mA cm-2 for more than 24 h, making it a viable non-precious metal-based electrocatalyst for alkaline OER. This synthetic approach could open up new possibilities for the fabrication of MOF-based hierarchical Prussian blue analogs as well as derivatives to be oriented for applications in various fields.

TI Spatially controlled positioning of coordination polymer nanoparticles
   onto heterogeneous nanostructured surfaces
SO NANOSCALE
AB Prussian Blue Analog (PBA) nanoparticles were formed on a heterogeneous nanostructured surface made of an ordered nanoperforated titanium oxide thin film deposited on a gold layer. The study of the nanocomposite film by grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy shows that the PBA particles are precisely positioned within all the perforations of the oxide film over very large surface areas. Further investigation on the formation of the PBA particles demonstrates a decisive role of a heterogeneous nucleation of the coordination polymer driven by well-adjusted surfaces energies and reactant concentrations in the spatial positioning of the PBA particles. Thanks to the well-controlled positioning of the particles within the ordered nanoperforations, the latter were successfully used as nano crucibles for the local transformation of PBA into the corresponding metal alloy by heat treatment. The thin film heterostructure thus obtained, made of ferromagnetic islands isolated by diamagnetic walls, opens interesting perspectives for the design of magnetic storage devices.

TI Three-dimensional porous graphene/nickel cobalt mixed oxide composites
   for high-performance hybrid supercapacitor
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Transition metallic mixed oxides have gained great interest for hybrid supercapacitor because of their extremely low cost and excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, we report a novel approach of overabundant metallic-ions- induced combination and space confined Ostwald ripening strategy to synthesize three-dimension graphene (3DG)/metal organic framework composite which could be transformed into 3DG/NixCo1-xO aerogel with NixCo1-xO nanoparticles well dispersed on graphene framework. The hierarchical structure provides highly interconnected porous conductive network and enhances contact between NixCo1-xO nanoparticle and graphene greatly. Electrochemical measurement indicates that the 3DG/NixCo1-xO electrode delivers a specific capacitance of 697.8 F g(-1), remarkable rate performance with 89% capacitance retention at current density of 20 A g(-1), and outstanding cycle stability with 81% specific capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. An optimized hybrid supercapacitor adopting 3DG/NixCo1-xO composite as the cathode and 3DG as the anode is constructed, which shows a superior energy density of 27.2 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 725 W kg(-1) and satisfactory cycle stability of 86% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g(-1).

TI Rational Fabrication of

   Tandem Heterojunction toward Optimized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution
SO SOLAR RRL
AB Graphdiyne (GDY) is a novel two-dimensional material composed of sp and sp(2) hybridized carbon atoms. Herein, GDY nanosheets are prepared from tribromobenzene by a simple ball-milling-assisted reduction-elimination method and is introduced into Fe3O4 colloidal spheres and Co3O4 cubes by low-temperature mixing to efficiently synthesize Fe3O4/Co3O4/GDY tandem heterojunction photocatalysts. The hydrogen evolution activity of the optimized catalyst is 4.02 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light (? = 420 nm), which is 100.05, 10.05, and 3.65 times higher than that of Fe3O4 (0.04 mmol g(-1) h(-1)), Co3O4 (0.40 mmol g(-1) h(-1)), and GDY (1.10 mmol g(-1) h(-1)), respectively. In addition, the Prussian blue analog (PBA)-derived Co3O4 improves the light-harvesting efficiency and reaction kinetics. More importantly, the establishment of tandem heterojunctions prompts energy-level alignment and optimizes charge multichannel transfer, which is the dominant factor for enhanced photocatalytic activity. Combined with time-resolved photoluminescence spectra, valence band X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the possible mechanism of Fe3O4/Co3O4/GDY series heterojunction is proposed and elucidated. This work provides a new idea for the construction of tandem heterojunctions based on graphdiyne and PBA derivatives.

TI Graphene Aerogel Supported Fe-Co Selenide Nanocubes as Binder-Free
   Anodes for Lithium-Ion Batteries
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANORGANISCHE UND ALLGEMEINE CHEMIE
AB Metal selenides as anode materials of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has received considerable attention recently. In order to boost the electronic conductivity and alleviate the volume change of electrode materials upon the cycles, a facile strategy is employed in this work, where Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes are encapsulated into three-dimensional (3D) network of graphene aerogel (GA), followed by a high-temperature selenization treatment to isolate the composite of FeCoSe2@GA. The composite can be directly employed as free-standing anode materials of LIBs. Studies reveal that the FeCoSe2@GA electrode demonstrates an intriguing cycle stability and rate capability with a specific capacity of similar to 500 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles. The outstanding lithium-storage properties can be attributed to the 3D porous feature as well as the strong confinement effect of GA for FeCoSe2 particles, which provides a large number of ion-exchange channels, and prevents the severe agglomeration and large volume expansion of active particles during the charge/discharge process.

TI Shape stable poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels with immobilized metal
   hexacyanoferrates for cesium removal from waters
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The metal hexacyanoferrates with transition metal ions to replace ferric ions in the face center cubic structure of Prussian blue (PB) crystals are candidate adsorbents for radioactive cesium ions in waters. This study for the first time synthesized the shape stable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels with immobilized metal hexacynoferrate (PB analogue) that can be stored at dry and can efficiently adsorb cesium ions from waters after rewetting. A total of eight PB analogue particles in two families M-3[Fe(III)(CN)(6)](2) (MFe(III)) or M-4[Fe(II)(CN)(6)](2) (MFe(II)) with M=Zn, Ni, Cu, or Co were synthesized and were immobilized in the PVA hydrogels following boric acid and sulfate crosslinking. The produced PVA-PB analogue hydrogels are all stable in shape after dry and rewet, and the rewet hydrogels can adsorb cesium ions from waters at much higher rates. As predicted by the diffusion-reaction model, the apparent reaction constants for cesium ion adsorption are 4.2x10(-4) 1/s, 3.4x10(-4) 1/s, 3.9x10(-4) 1/s, 4.1x10(-4) 1/s, 4.1x10(-4) 1/s, 3.8x10(-4) 1/s, 1.1x10(-3) 1/s, and 9.6x10(-4) 1/s, for ZnFe(III), ZnFe(II), NiFe(III), NiFe(II), CuFe(III), CuFe(II), CoFe(III), and CoFe(II), respectively. The corresponding maximum adsorption capacities based on Langmuir isotherm model at 25 degrees C are 232.6 mg/g, 389.0 mg/g, 193.9 mg/g, 256.8 mg/g, 388.2 mg/g, 395.1 mg/g, 297.3 mg/g, and 391.2 mg/g, respectively. The use of PVA-CoFe(III) is the candidate for enhanced Cs removal from waters comparing the use of other PB analogues as adsorbent.

TI Preparation of Nx-Fe/Fe3C/KVO3
   composites by heat treatment for high-performance electrocatalytic
   oxygen evolution
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB Cementite (Fe3C) as a special iron-carbon alloy has excellent electrical conductivity, while its electron-rich iron-carbon bonds provide potential electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance. In this work, novel N-x Fe/Fe3C/KVO3 composites were obtained by simple heat treatment using K V Fe Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) nanocubes as precursors. The residual nitrogen after heat treatment using Prussian blue can introduce new C N active sites, which can further improve the OER performance of these composites. The KVO3 can also synergize with N-x-Fe/Fe3C, thus requiring an overpotential of 359.9 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA . cm(-2) at a sweep rate of 2 mV- s(-1). Moreover, the Tafel slope of these electrocatalysts is only 32.9 mV . dec(-1), indicating its high-speed OER reaction kinetic process. This work provides a new idea for constructing Fe,C composite with other materials and will promote the development of non-noble metal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution.

TI The Role of Carrier Ion-Ligand Interaction on Intercalation Potentials
   and Phase Evolution of Berlin Green Cathodes in Rechargeable Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Intercalation and deintercalation are fundamental processes in battery electrodes that involve the reversible addition and extraction of carrier ions such as lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) into a host framework made of transition metal (TM) ions and ligands. Although TM-ligand interactions are known to primarily determine intercalation potentials, a comprehensive understanding of their interactions involving the carrier ions still remains elusive. This study investigates the complex interactions between carrier ions (Li and Na) and the ligand in Berlin green (BG, Fe3+[Fe3+(CN)6]) cathodes to elucidate their effects on intercalation potentials and phase evolution. Comprehensive X-ray characterizations and electrochemical analyses reveal that the strong carrier ion-ligand interaction, influenced by the type and concentration of carrier ions, can modify the electronic structure of Fe ions and affect the intercalated structure of BG cathodes, thereby tuning the intercalation potentials. Specifically, the enhanced covalent interaction of the Na-CN units compared with that of the Li-CN units induces rhombohedral distortion in the fully sodiated state and increases the working potential of high-spin Fe ions. The findings highlight the critical role of carrier ion-ligand interactions in tuning the electrochemical properties of battery electrodes for the design of advanced battery systems.
   The intercalation potentials and dynamic phase evolution of Berlin green (BG) cathode are investigated in Li/Na-ion batteries. The carrier ion-cyanide anion interactions affect the intercalation potentials and the phase evolution, depending on the type and occupancy of carrier ions. The strong covalency Na-CN unit elevates the intercalation potentials and results in the cubic-to-rhombohedral distortion of the BG framework. image

TI Electrochemical and Cycle Analysis of Water-in-Salt K-Acetate
   Electrolyte Zn-Ion Batteries Under Commercially-Relevant Conditions
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Water-in-salt electrolyte (WiSE) promises high-voltage battery technology with low fire risk. Here we assess potassium acetate (KAc) WiSE for Zn ion batteries under commercially relevant conditions. Rotating disc electrode analysis of WiSE degradation and Zn plating/deplating suggest a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer dominates. Butler-Volmer kinetics and Koutecky-Levich mass-transfer are of secondary importance. Measurements of chemical potential reveal that bulk solvation of H2O (in KAc WiSE or lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) WiSE) is an insignificant process compared to SEI blocking. Zinc cycling in KAc WiSE with practical rates (similar to 0.3 to 8.0 mA cm-2) and areal capacities (>20 mAh cm-2) shows dendrites are less prominent than in KOH, but the SEI layer suppresses the electrochemical reaction too much for commercial feasibility. Dilution or convection of the WiSE alleviates the SEI blocking effects. Cu substrate shows good Zn adhesion, but Ti, Sn, and Ni show poor adhesion. Cathodes made with Chevrel (Mo6S8) reversibly intercalate Zn2+ to form a novel battery technology when paired with Zn foil, but yield <1.0 V cell voltage. Cathodes made with zinc-containing Prussian blue analogues (ZnHCF or ZnMnHCF) yield a voltage near 2.0 V but don't cycle in the present KAc WiSE formulation. Future research directions for KAc WiSE are proposed, focussing on SEI dynamics and Prussian blue compatibility.

TI Origin of the Material Dependence of the Temperature Coefficient of the
   Redox Potential in Coordination Polymers
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB The thermal coefficient alpha (= dV/dT) of the redox potential (V) is an important physical parameter for thermal energy harvesting. We systematically investigated alpha of six Prussian blue analogues (M-PBAs; M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Cd) and Na2Zn3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) (Zn-HCF) in aqueous solution of 17 mol/kg NaClO4. We found that alpha shows significant material dependence and ranges from -1.18 mV/K in Cd-PBA to 0.57 mV/K in Co-PBA. We further found that (I) alpha >= 0 (alpha <= 0) if the redox site is M ([Fe(CN)(6)]), and (II) vertical bar alpha vertical bar increases with the Na site number (N) of the Na site around the central position of the nanopore. We interpreted the observations in terms of the variation (Delta S-Na) of the Na configuration entropy (S-Na) in the vicinity of the redox site.

Here, we explore the core/shell-type materials of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) by heteroepitaxial growth and demonstrate how one phase structurally dominates the other. The volumetric ratio between the shell and core crystals determine the final structure of the hybrids. The outermost dominated the Na+ ion insertion/extraction, illustrating how the hybridization can adjust the function of PBAs.

TI Disruptive Strategy To Fabricate Three-Dimensional Ultrawide Interlayer
   Porous Carbon Framework-Supported Prussian Blue Nanocubes: A Carrier for
   NiFe-Layered Double-Hydroxide toward Oxygen Evolution
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB We, for the first time, offer a unique and disruptive strategy to prepare N-doped three-dimensional porous carbon framework-supported well-defined Fe4[Fe-(CN)6]3 nanocubes (indicated as PB@N-PCFs). The carbon frameworks hold an ultrawide interlayer spacing of 0.385-0.402 nm for the (002) planes of graphite and ultrahigh graphitization. Furthermore, PB@N-PCFs are used as a carrier to grow NiFe-layered-double-hydroxide nanosheet arrays (denoted as NiFe-LDH/PB@N-PCFs) in situ, where the interlayer spacing for the (002) planes of graphite can be expanded as high as 0.457 nm in the carbon frameworks. Moreover, NiFe-LDH/PB@N-PCFs shows excellent electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen evolution in terms of activity, kinetics, and durability, elegantly rivaling the state-of-the-art RuO2. More profoundly, after 3000 cycle cyclic voltammetry scans, NiFe-LDH/PB@N-PCFs still display far more desirable activity with respect to initial NiFe-LDH/PB@N-PCFs. We believe that the PB@N-PCFs and PB@N-PCFs-based composites with ultrahighly graphitized and large interlayer spacing N-PCFs can find more places in electrochemistry-related applications such as Na/K-ion batteries, electrocatalysis, and electrochemical sensors.

TI 2D Network overtakes 3D for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB 3-Dimensional (3D) cyanide coordination polymers, typically known as Prussian blue Analogues (PBAs), have received great attention in catalysis due to their stability, easily tuned metal sites, and porosity. However, their high crystallinities and relatively low number of surface-active sites significantly hamper their intrinsic catalytic activities. Herein, we report the utilization of a 2-dimensional (2D) layered cobalt tetracyanonickelate, [Co-Ni], for the reduction of protons to H-2. Relying on its exposed facets, layered morphology, and abundant surface-active sites, [Co-Ni] can efficiently convert water and sunlight to H-2 in the presence of a ruthenium photosensitizer (Ru PS) with an optimal evolution rate of 30 029 +/- 590 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), greatly exceeding that of 3D Co-Fe PBA [Co-Fe] and Co-Co PBA [Co-Co]. Furthermore, [Co-Ni] retains its structural integrity throughout a 6 hour photocatalytic cycle, which is confirmed by XPS, PXRD, and Infrared analysis. This recent work reveals the excellent morphologic properties that promote [Co-Ni] as an attractive catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

TI Ultra-fast and high-stable near-pseudocapacitance intercalation cathode
   for aqueous potassium-ion storage
SO NANO ENERGY
AB The intrinsically limited rate capability of batteries by the diffusion-controlled ionic storage mechanism is still existing, and long-service batteries are always required for low-cost grid-scale energy storage. Herein, we design and construct a series of NixZnyHCF (x + y = 3, x = 1, 1.5 or 2) bimetallic Prussian blue analogues as cathode materials for aqueous potassium-ion batteries. On the basis of electrochemical and structural analysis, a synergistic effect between stable Ni2+ and high-voltage Zn2+ in Ni2Zn1HCF is demonstrated, which simultaneously promises ultrafast near-pseudocapacitance intercalation and super-stable potassium storage. As presented, Ni2Zn1HCF cathode shows an extraordinary high-rate capability of 1000C with a capacity retention of 66% and a high capacity recovery of 95.3%, which derives from the large sufeace area and fast near-pseudocapacitive intercalation mechanism. When cycled at 1000C for 80,000 times, a negligible capacity decay of 0.000385% per cycle further proves this cathode to be high-rate and ultra-stable. In addition, the highly reversible solid-solution K+ intercalation/extraction mechanism in the Ni2Zn1HCF cathode is illustrated by the in-situ X-ray diffraction. This work presents a promising cathode for building ultrafast and long-service aqueous potassium-ion batteries.

TI Recent Progress and Future Advances on Aqueous Monovalent-Ion Batteries
   towards Safe and High-Power Energy Storage
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Aqueous monovalent-ion batteries have been rapidly developed recently as promising energy storage devices in large-scale energy storage systems owing to their fast charging capability and high power densities. In recent years, Prussian blue analogues, polyanion-type compounds, and layered oxides have been widely developed as cathodes for aqueous monovalent-ion batteries because of their low cost and high theoretical capacity. Furthermore, many design strategies have been proposed to expand their electrochemical stability window by reducing the amount of free water molecules and introducing an electrolyte addictive. This review highlights the advantages and drawbacks of cathode and anode materials, and summarizes the correlations between the various strategies and the electrochemical performance in terms of structural engineering, morphology control, elemental compositions, and interfacial design. Finally, this review can offer rational principles and potential future directions in the design of aqueous monovalent-ion batteries.

TI Ultrafine CoFe nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon sheets
   boost oxygen electrocatalysis for Zn-air batteries
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Efficient, durable and inexpensive electrocatalysts are urgently needed to mediate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, ultrafine CoFe alloyed nanoparticles (NPs) homogeneously decorated on N-doped carbon nanosheets (CoFe@NCS) are syn-thesized by annealing the precursor of NCS supported CoFe-based Prussian-blue-analogues. The optimal CoFe@NCS delivers prominent electrocatalytic behaviors for both the ORR (0.88 V of half-wave potential) and OER (340 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm-2) in an alkaline electrolyte. The outstanding bifunctional elec-trocatalytic activities are ascribed to the synergistic interplay of structural and compositional advantages, including the hierarchically porous structure as well as the strong coupling of ultrafine CoFe species and NCS. Simultaneously, the assembled flow ZAB with CoFe@NCS as the air-cathode catalyst manifests a superior battery performance to the device catalyzed by the noble-metal benchmark (Pt/C + RuO2). This work may pave an avenue for developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts and promoting the practical application of ZABs.

TI Techno-economic analysis of capacitive and intercalative water
   deionization
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB We conduct a techno-economic analysis of electrochemical water deionization technologies. The objective of the analysis is to compare cost, volume, and energy consumption of membrane capacitive deionization (mCDI) to intercalative deionization techniques. Here, we first explore the concept of hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI),i.e., a cation intercalation electrode paired with an activated carbon capacitive electrode. Then we explore in detail a novel device concept, fully intercalative water deionization (IDI), which relies entirely on the cation intercalation principle. The intercalation host materials in our study are Prussian blue analogs (PBAs),e.g., NiFe(CN)(6)or CuFe(CN)(6), that offer similar to 3-5x higher gravimetric salt removal capacities than typical activated carbon. Our analysis shows that IDI should be superior to mCDI in module cost, volume, and energy efficiency, despite a more complex module architecture. Making careful assumptions on material costs, we provide a cost breakdown for mCDI, HCDI, and IDI modules and show that IDI is the only concept that is not dominated by ion exchange membrane costs. The environmental impact of electrochemical water deionization is illustrated by estimating the carbon footprint of currently installed reverse osmosis capacity in different world regions and comparing it to the respective carbon footprint of mCDI, HCDI, and IDI at similar capacity.

AB Multi-shelled hollow metal-organic frameworks (MH-MOFs) are highly promising as electrode materials due to their impressive surface area and efficient mass transfer capabilities. However, the fabrication of MH-MOFs has remained a formidable challenge. In this study, two types of double-shelled open hollow Prussian blue analogues, one with divalent iron (DHPBA-Fe(II)) and the other with trivalent iron (DHPBA-Fe(III)), through an innovative inner-outer growth strategy are successfully developed. The growth mechanism is found to involve lattice matching growth and ligand exchange processes. Subsequently, DHPBA-Fe(II) and DHPBA-Fe(III) are employed as cathodes in aqueous Zn-ion batteries. Significantly, DHPBA-Fe(II) demonstrated exceptional performance, exhibiting a capacity of 92.5 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1, and maintaining remarkable stability over an astounding 10 000 cycles. This research is poised to catalyze further exploration into the fabrication techniques of MH-MOFs and offer fresh insights into the intricate interplay between electronic structure and battery performance.

TI FeCo/N-co-doped 3D carbon nanofibers as efficient bifunctional oxygen

SO NANOSCALE
AB Flexible zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are expected to become a promising candidate in energy storage equipment for wearable electronic devices. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have impeded the development of ZABs. Herein, an FeCo- and N-codoped bifunctional electrocatalyst (FeCoNCF) is fabricated by simple one-pot and pyrolysis strategies. Concretely, the bacterial cellulose (BC) and Prussian blue analogue (PBA) derived transition metal and nitrogen doped carbon (M-N-C) composites provide ORR and OER active sites. FeCoNCF exhibits outstanding ORR and OER activities. It displays a favorable high half-wave potential (0.81 V) and a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (341 mV), which are on a par with commercial Pt/C and RuO2, and shows outstanding stability. The sandwich-type flexible zinc-air battery containing FeCoNCF shows a favorable power density (49.29 mW cm(-2)) and superior cycling stability.

TI Zeolite-Templated Carbon as a Stable, High Power Magnesium -Ion Cathode
   Material
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB One strategy to overcome the slow kinetics associated with electrochemical magnesium ion storage is to employ a permanently porous, capacitive cathode material together with magnesium metal as the anode. This strategy has begun to be employed, for example, using framework solids like Prussian blue analogues or porous carbons derived from metal organic frameworks, but the cycling stability of an ordered, bottom-up synthesized, three-dimensional carbon framework toward magnesiation and demagnesiation in a shuttle -type battery remains unexplored. Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) are a class of ordered porous carbonaceous framework materials with numerous superlative properties relevant to electrochemical energy storage. Herein, we report that ZTCs can serve as high-power cathode materials for magnesium-ion hybrid capacitors (MHCs), exhibiting high specific capacities (e.g., 113 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles) with an average discharge voltage of 1.44 V and exceptional capacity retention (e.g., 76% after 200 cycles). ZTC-based MHCs meet or exceed the gravimetric energy densities of stateof-the-art batteries functioning on the Mg2+ shuttle, while simultaneously displaying far superior rate capabilities (e.g., 834 W kg-1 at 600 mA g-1).

TI Conceptualizing Surface-Like Diffusion for Ultrafast Ionic Conduction in
   Solid-State Materials
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Surface-like diffusion is a recently proposed concept to explain the mechanism of ultrafast ionic conduction in high-rate oxide (e. g., niobium oxides and their alloys with TiO2 and WO3) and framework materials (e. g., Prussian blue analogs). This perspective seeks to illustrate the structural origin, theoretical foundation, and experimental evidences of surface-like diffusion. Unlike classical lattice diffusion, which typically involves ionic hopping between adjacent interstitial sites in solids, surface-like diffusion occurs when ions-that are significantly smaller than the interstitials-migrate along the off-center path in the diffusion channel. This mechanism results in an exceptionally low activation energy (Ea) down to 0.2 eV, which is crucial for achieving high-rate performance in electrochemical devices such as lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. This concept review also discusses the criteria to identify materials with potential surface-like diffusion and outlines theoretical and experimental tools to capture such phenomenon. Several candidates for further investigation are proposed based on the current understanding of the mechanism.

TI Periodic Stratification of Colloids in a Liquid Phase Produced by a
   Precipitation Reaction and Gel Swelling
SO LANGMUIR
AB Pattern formation is a frequent phenomenon occurring in animate and inanimate systems. The interplay between the mass transport of the chemical species and the underlying chemical reaction networks generates most patterns in chemical systems. Periodic precipitation is an emblematic example of reaction-diffusion patterns, in which the process generates a spatial periodic structure in porous media. Here, we use the dormant reagent method to produce colloidal particles of Prussian blue (PB) and PB analogues at the liquid-gel interface. The generated particles produced a stable periodic stratification pattern in time in the liquid phase placed on top of the solid hydrogel. The phenomenon is governed by periodic swelling of the gel driven by the osmotic stress and stability of the formed particles. To illustrate the phenomenon, we developed an extended reaction-diffusion model, which incorporated the gel swelling and sedimentation effect of the formed colloids and could qualitatively reproduce the pattern formation in the liquid phase.

TI Preintercalated Copper Hexacyanoferrate as a Long-Time Cycle Cathode
   Material for Aqueous Aluminum-Ion Batteries
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have emerged as a promising electrode material for aqueous aluminum-ion batteries (AAIBs) due to their three-dimensional (3D) open-framework structure. However, the problems of brief cycling life and poor rate capability are still to be solved urgently in application. In this article, copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) is synthesized by a simple coprecipitation method, and the preintercalation of CuHCF is successfully regulated at different temperatures as a cathode material for the AAIBs. Different preintercalation temperatures have a significant effect on the electrochemical performances for the resulting CuHCF. With the contribution of Al3+ ions preintercalated inside CuHCF, stability and conductivity could be greatly enhanced during the electrochemical tests. Al3+ ions preintercalated in CuHCF support the crystal structure, expand the interlayer space, and reduce structural changes in the process of charge and discharge, with open channels improving ionic conductivity. The optimized CuHCF preintercalated at 40 degrees C (CuHCF-P40) shows the greatest capacity and best cycling properties. The CuHCF-P40 delivers a discharge capacity of 83.1 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, which is about 1.6 times higher than that of the original CuHCF. The CuHCF-P40 has long-time stability, the specific capacity can still be maintained at 54.5 mA h g-1, and its capacity retention is 80.3% after 5000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. This strategy of improving PBA materials through preintercalation provides a new idea for further application of PBA materials in AAIBs.

TI Hydrogen Bond-Assisted Ultra-Stable and Fast Aqueous
   NH4<SUP>+</SUP> Storage
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB Aqueous ammonium ion batteries are regarded as eco-friendly and sustainable energy storage systems. And applicable host for NH4+ in aqueous solution is alwasy in the process solution is always in the p of development. On the basis of density functional theory calculations, the excellent performance of NH4+ insertion in Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) is proposed, especially for copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF). In this work, we prove the outstanding cycling and rate performance of CuHCF via electrochemical analyses, delivering no capacity fading during ultra-long cycles of 3000 times and high capacity retention of 93.6% at 50 C. One of main contributions to superior performance from highly reversible redox reaction and structural change is verified during the ammoniation/de-ammoniation progresses. More importantly, we propose the NH4+ diffusion mechanism in CuHCF based on continuous formation and fracture of hydrogen bonds from a joint theoretical and experimental study, which is another essential reason for rapid charge transfer and superior NH4+ storage. Lastly, a full cell by coupling CuHCF cathode and polyaniline anode is constructed to explore the practical application of CuHCF. In brief, the outstanding aqueous NH4+ storage in cubic PBAs creates a blueprint for fast and sustainable energy storage.

TI Additive-Free, In Situ Rapid Repair of Vacancies in
   Fe[Fe(CN)6] Electrodes for Efficient Capacitive Deionization
SO LANGMUIR
AB Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] (FeHCF) is considered a promising material for capacitive deionization-desalination of saline wastewater due to its excellent structure. However, additives are usually introduced during the synthesis of FeHCF in order to avoid [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) vacancy defects filled by ligand water, which can result in the appearance of harmful byproducts and additional water treatment costs. In this study, an additive-free in situ vacancy repair strategy is proposed for the rapid synthesis of high-quality FeHCF in a saturated K3Fe(CN)(6) solution. During the process of synthesizing FeHCF in solution, a high concentration of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) is found to facilitate the binding of Fe3+ to [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) and hinder the hydrolysis and coordination reaction of Fe3+. After undergoing repair, FeHCF4 demonstrates an increased capacity and highly reversible electrochemical performance due to the robust structure. When utilized as Faraday cathodes in hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI) systems, FeHCF4 exhibits a higher salt removal capacity (65.67 mg g(-1)) and lower energy consumption (0.68 kWh kg(-1)-NaCl) compared to unrepaired FeHCF1, while still maintaining excellent cycling performance. This environmentally friendly approach of repairing vacancies serves as a source of inspiration for the advancement of high-performance Prussian Blue analogues as capacitive sodium-removing materials.

TI Common ion effect enhanced cobalt hexacyanoferrate for aqueous Na-ion
   battery
SO COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING
AB Given the merits of rich reserves, high ion conductivity and non-combustion property, aqueous sodium ion batteries (SIBs) were once considered as high-quality substitutes for organic lithium ion batteries. However, due to the large radius of carrier sodium ion and unstable structure of electrode materials, the practical implementation of aqueous SIBs is seriously impeded. In this work, a reliable aqueous SIB is constructed by employing Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)] as cathode, which is synthesized by co-precipitation assisted electrochemical synthesis. As a Prussian blue analogue (PBA), Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)] inherits open framework structure, ion insertion stability and electrochemical tunability. Benefitting from common ion effect, Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)] can maintain stable host structure in the SIBs with CoSO4 as an additive of electrolyte, and exhibits an exceptional cycling stability without capacity decay over 2000 cycles and outstanding rate performance. By further exploring the changes in crystal structure, elemental valence states and ion storage kinetics, it fully explains the structural and electrochemical stability of Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)] as the cathode for aqueous SIBs and the mechanism of Na+ insertion/extraction during cycling process. This work provides a pathway to settle the problems of large carrier ion and structural instability in aqueous SIBs, and greatly broadens the path of its research and development.

TI A confinement approach to fabricate hybrid PBAs-derived FeCo@NC
   yolk-shell nanoreactors for bisphenol A degradation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this study, a FeCo alloy@N-doped carbon yolk-shell nanoreactors (ANCYNs) was synthesized through the confinement pyrolysis of the polydopamine (PDA)-coated Fe/Co Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). The PDA-derived carbon shell formed preferentially via pyrolysis is of relevance to (i) protecting the framework structure from collapsing, (ii) increasing the specific surface areas and pore volumes, (iii) facilitating the adsorption of pollutants, and (iv) solving the metal leaching problem. The resulting ANCYNs exhibits good peroxomonosulfate (PMS) activation to degrade bisphenol A (BPA) (removing 98% of BPA in 5 mins), which is significantly better in catalytic performance and stability than those of the single-metal@NC or Nano-alloy catalysts. First-principles calculations indicate that the charge density redistribution becomes much more pronounced when adsorbed on nitrogen-doped graphene with the compressive strain, which leads to a higher density of active sites exposed. The radicals and non-radical processes were confirmed to be simultaneously responsible for BPA degradation.

TI Recent Progress on High-Performance Cathode Materials for Zinc-Ion

SO SMALL STRUCTURES
AB Rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have emerged as a contender in the area of electrochemical energy storage applications due to their low cost and inherent safety. To optimize the battery performances, ZIBs cathode materials with high capacity and cyclability have been intensively studied, with most attention focused on traditional manganese- and vanadium-based materials. Recently, other novel cathode materials including Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), polyanions, metal sulfides, and organic compounds have begun to gain recognition as promising alternatives. These materials exhibit distinct strength such as high operating voltage, additional capacity by new redox chemistry activation, and/or highly reversible cycling process that are particularly desirable for ZIBs applications. To provide the highlight they deserve, this review focuses on introducing the recent progresses of these ZIBs cathodes and demonstrating common strategies adopted for material modification and optimization. Finally, systematic comparisons among the cathode materials are analyzed, along with challenges and perspectives on each category of the cathodes.

TI Advances in Understanding the Electrocatalytic Reconstruction Chemistry

SO SMALL
AB Coordination compounds including mainstream metal-organic frameworks and Prussian blue analogues receive extensive researches when they directly serve as electrocatalysts. Their reconstruction phenomena, that are closely associated with actual contributions and intrinsic catalytic mechanisms, are expected to be well summarized. Here, the recent advances in understanding reconstruction chemistry of coordination compounds are reviewed, including their main classifications and structural properties, reconstruction phenomena in electrocatalysis (e.g., oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction), influence factors of reconstruction parameters (e.g., reconstruction rate and reconstruction degree), and reconstruction-performance correlation. It is outlined that the reconstruction processes are influenced by electronic structure of coordination compounds, pH and temperature of testing solution, and applied potentials. The characterization techniques reflecting the evolution information before and after catalysis are also introduced for reconstruction-related mechanistic study. Finally, some challenges and outlooks on reconstruction investigations of coordination compounds are proposed, and the necessity of studying and understanding of these themes under actual working conditions of devices is highlighted.

Non-precious metal based catalysts have emerged as the most promising materials for the replacement of state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts. However, more progress is still needed to improve the activity and stability of these catalysts. Herein, we synthesized Co3ZnC/Co nanojunctions encapsulated in highly nitrogen doped graphene layers by one-step annealing of Prussian blue analogues (PBA). The catalyst shows a low overpotential of only 366 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to state-of-the-art commercial RuO2 catalysts. Besides, it exhibits a better performance compared with similar metallic carbide-based catalysts towards ORR with an onset potential and cathodic peak potential at 0.912 V and 0.814 V, respectively.

TI Origin of the High Specific Capacity in Sodium Manganese
   Hexacyanomanganate
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanomanganate, NaxMn[Mn(CN)6], is anelectrochemically active Prussian blue analogue (PBA) that has been studiedexperimentally as an electrode material in rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. It hasa reversible specific capacity of 209 mA h g-1, which is substantially higher than thetheoretical specific capacity of 172 mA h g-1expected for two reduction eventsconventional in PBAs. It has been suggested that the high specific capacityoriginates from this compound's unique ability to insert a third sodium ion performula unit. However, the plausibility of this mechanism has remainedambiguous. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) with a hybridfunctional to calculate the formation energies of various oxidation states andmagnetic phases of the NaxMn[Mn(CN)6] system. We confirm that the compound Na3MnII[MnI(CN)6]is,indeed,thermodynamically stable. It contains manganese(I), and the sodium ions occupy the interfacial position of the lattice subcubes.We also provide strong evidence that the phase of the fully oxidized Mn[Mn(CN)6] compound is charge-disproportionated,containing manganese(II) and manganese(IV). We proceed to show that the presence of crystalline water increases the reductionpotential of the system and that the hydrated compounds have theoretical crystal geometries and reduction potentials that closelymatch the experiment. This work clarifies the charge-storage mechanism in a well-known but less-understood PBA

TI Small-angle neutron scattering study of the short-range organization of

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Prussian blue analogues magnetic nanoparticles (of radius R-0 = 2.4-8.6 nm) embedded in PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) or CTA(+) (cetyltrimethylammonium) matrices have been studied using neutron diffraction and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) at several concentrations. For the most diluted particles in neutral PVP, the SANS signal is fully accounted for by a "single-particle" spherical form factor with no structural correlations between the nanoparticles and with radii comparable to those inferred from neutron diffraction. For higher concentration in PVP, structural correlations modify the SANS signal with the appearance of a structure factor peak, which is described using an effective "mean-field" model. A new length scale R* approximate to 3R(0), corresponding to an effective repulsive interaction radius, is evidenced in PVP samples. In CTA(+), electrostatic interactions play a crucial role and lead to a dense layer of CTA(+) around the nanoparticles, which considerably alter the SANS patterns as compared to PVP. The SANS data of nanoparticles in CTA(+) are best described by a core-shell model without visible inter-particle structure factor. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

TI ZIFs-Derived Hollow Nanostructures via a Strong/Weak Coetching Strategy
   for Long-Life Rechargeable Zn-Air Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Recently, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) composites have emerged as promising precursors for synthesizing hollow-structured N-doped carbon-based noble-metal materials with diverse structures and compositions. Here, a strong/weak competitive coordination strategy is presented for synthesizing high-performance electrocatalysts with hollow features. During the competitive coordination process, the cubic zeolitic-imidazole framework-8 (Cube-8)@ZIF-67 with core-shell structures are transformed into Cube-8@ZIF-67@PF/POM with yolk-shell nanostructures employing phosphomolybdic acid (POM) and potassium ferricyanide (PF) as the strong chelator and the weak chelator, respectively. After calcination, the hollow Mo/Fe/Co@NC catalyst exhibits superior performance in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Interestingly, the Mo/Fe/Co@NC catalyst exhibits efficient electrocatalytic performance for Zn-air batteries (ZABs), with a high power density (approximate to 150 mW cm-2) and superior cycling life (approximate to 500 h) compared to commercial platinum/carbon (Pt/C) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) mixture benchmarks catalysts. In addition, the density functional theory further proves that after the introduction of Mo and Fe atoms, the adsorption energy with the adsorption intermediates is weakened by adjusting the d-band center, thus weakening the reaction barrier and promoting the reaction kinetics of OER. Undoubtedly, this study presents novel insights into the fabrication of ZIFs-derived hollow structure bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for clean-energy diverse applications.
   Herein, controlled structural transitions of metal-organic frameworks through a strong/weak competitive coordination strategy for long-life rechargeable Zn-air batteries are reported. Specifically, the as-constructed catalysts exhibit excellent bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity in the alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, when assembled into aZn-air battery, the catalyst demonstrates a large peak power density and outstanding stability as demonstrated by long-term charge-discharge cycling measurements. image

SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB New nanometer scale heterostructure particles of the two-dimensional Hofmann-like Fe(II) spin-cross-over network, Fe(phpy)(2)[Ni(CN)(4)]center dot 0.5H(2)O {phpy = 4-phenylpyridine}, and the Prussian blue analogue K0.4Ni1.0[Cr(CN)(6)](0.8)center dot nH(2)O (NiCr-PBA) have been developed, exhibiting synergistic photomagnetic effects, whereby the LIESST (light-induced electron spin-state trapping) effect in the Hofmann-like material induces a magnetization change in the NiCr-PBA. A variety of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques demonstrate the heterogeneous growth of the NiCr-PBA on the Hofmann seed particles and show the Hofmann compound retains its thermal and photoinduced spin transition properties in the heterostructure. The photoinduced magnetization change in the NiCr-PBA network arises from coupling of the two lattices despite dissimilar structure types. Isothermal magnetization minor hysteresis loop studies at 5 K show light absorption leads to changes in the local anisotropy of NiCr-PBA magnetic domains, providing direct evidence for a general magnetomechanical mechanism of light-switchable magnetism in coordination polymer heterostructures combining a photoactive material with a magnet.

TI A copper hexacyanocobaltate nanocubes based dopamine sensor in the
   presence of ascorbic acid
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB A novel copper hexacyanocobaltate based sensor was developed and its electrocatalytic behavior towards the oxidation of dopamine (DA) was demonstrated. Among the Prussian blue analogues, copper hexacyanocobaltate (CuHCC) exhibits unique electrochemical responses due to its bimetallic combination of copper and cobalt. As-prepared CuHCC shows a well-defined cubic structure with an average size of around 252 nm, which was confirmed by XRD and FE-SEM. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the coordination behavior of both the metal and ligand in CuHCC, which existed as Co-III-CN-Cu-II and Co-II-CN-Cu-III. The as-prepared CuHCC was used for the first time in DA detection and provided a better platform as a DA sensor. The electrocatalytic activity of CuHCC towards dopamine was examined by cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry. The CuHCC fabricated sensor shows a wide linear range from 0.1 to 350 mu mol L-1 and low detection limit of 19 mu mol L-1. The sensor reported herein displays excellent sensitivity, high stability and appreciable reproducibility for DA oxidation.

With 330 mAh g(-1) of reversible specific capacity, the battery has a stability of up to 1450 cycles thanks to the stability of Fe (CN)(6)(4-).

TI Nitrogen vacancy defects in single-particle nanodiamonds sense
   paramagnetic transition metal spin noise from nanoparticles on a
   transmission electron microscopy grid
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Spin-active nanomaterials play a vital role in current and upcoming quantum technologies, such as spintronics, data storage and computing. To advance the design and application of these materials, methods to link size, shape, structure, and chemical composition with functional magnetic properties at the nanoscale level are needed. In this work, we combine the power of two local probes, namely, Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) spin-active defects in diamond and an electron beam, within experimental platforms used in electron microscopy. Negatively charged NVs within fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) particles are used to sense the local paramagnetic environment of Rb0.5Co1.3[Fe(CN)(6)]& BULL;3.7H(2)O nanoparticles (NPs), a Prussian blue analogue (PBA), as a function of FND-PBA distance (order of 10 nm) and local PBA concentration. We demonstrate perturbation of NV spins by proximal electron spins of transition metals within NPs, as detected by changes in the photoluminescence (PL) of NVs. Workflows are reported and demonstrated that employ a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) finder grid to spatially correlate functional and structural features of the same unique NP studied using NV sensing, based on a combination of Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) and Magnetic Modulation (MM) of NV PL, within TEM imaging modalities. Significantly, spin-spin dipole interactions were detected between NVs in a single FND and paramagnetic metal centre spin fluctuations in NPs through a carbon film barrier of 13 nm thickness, evidenced by TEM tilt series imaging and Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS), opening new avenues to sense magnetic materials encapsulated in or between thin-layered nanostructures. The measurement strategies reported herein provide a pathway towards solid-state quantitative NV sensing with atomic-scale theoretical spatial resolution, critical to the development of quantum technologies, such as memory storage and molecular switching nanodevices.

TI An outlook on sodium-ion battery technology toward practical application
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The growing concerns over the environmental impact and resource limitations of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have driven the exploration of alternative energy storage technologies. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising candidate due to their reliance on earth-abundant materials, lower cost, and compatibility with existing LIB manufacturing infrastructure. This review explores the recent SIB cathode and anode materials advancements, highlighting the electrochemical properties, structural stability, and potential for large-scale applications. Key cathode materials, such as layered transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds, and Prussian blue analogs, are analyzed for capacity, stability, and improvement strategies. Challenges in anode development, particularly with hard carbon and alloy-based materials, are also discussed, as well as their performance in electric vehicles and grid storage. Overall, the findings underscore SIBs' potential as a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to LIBs, positioning them as a viable solution to meet the growing energy demands while mitigating environmental impact.

TI Enhancing the bifunctional activity of CoSe2 nanocubes by
   surface decoration of CeO2 for advanced zinc-air batteries
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The coupling of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) plays a key role in rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). However, both OER and ORR still suffer from sluggish kinetics, even when using the mainstream precious metal-based catalysts. Herein, oxygen vacancies-rich CeO2 decorated CoSe2 nanocubes are proposed as a novel air electrode to drive OER and ORR for ZABs. The resultant CeO2 coupled CoSe2 nanocubes (CeO2@CoSe2-NCs) catalyst exhibits a significantly enhanced bifunctional activity relative to the pristine CoSe2-NCs and the pristine CeO2. Moreover, an assembled ZABs using this CeO2@CoSe2-NCs electrode delivers a high output power density of 153 mW cm(-2) and a long-life stability over 400 cycles, superior to the benchmark Pt/C-IrO2 electrode. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electronic interaction and oxygen vacancies in CeO2@CoSe2-NCs contribute to efficient oxygen electrocatalysis. This protocol provides a promising approach of constructing oxygen vacancies in hybrid catalysts for energy conversion and storage devices. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Isolated Cu Sites in CdS Hollow Nanocubes with Doping-Location-Dependent
   Performance for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB Doping engineering has enabled the construction of homogeneous and abundant atomic-level catalytic sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with improved selectivity for the target product. However, little is known about the effect of the spatial position of the heteroatoms on the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductors toward CO2 reduction. Herein, uniform Cu doping into the bulk phase of hollow CdS cubes (HCC) and Cu doping onto the surface of HCC, denoted as Cu/HCC and HCC@Cu, respectively, are prepared by tuning the introduction order of Cu sources. Experimental analysis shows that the introduction of Cu by both methods can promote the separation and migration of photoinduced charge carriers in CdS. Notably, Cu doping onto the surface of CdS in HCC@Cu leads to much better proton reduction to H-2 production performance but lower CO2 reduction efficiency as compared to bare CdS. In sharp contrast, Cu doping into the bulk phase of CdS enhances the CO2-to-CO conversion while mitigating H-2 evolution. This should be ascribed to the smaller overpotential of Cu/HCC in the CO2 saturated system than that in the Ar system. In addition, doping Cu atoms into the bulk phase of CdS shifts the d band center of Cu/HCC upward to near the Fermi energy level, which promotes the adsorption and activation of CO2 on CdS. These results indicate that the photoelectrons with a prolonged lifetime in Cu/HCC preferably reduce CO2 molecules rather than protons. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show that the introduction of Cu heteroatoms can promote the desorption of CO*, and the adaptable sulfur vacancies (Vs) produced by in situ doping techniques can stimulate the formation of CO* intermediates, resulting in the high performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. This work reveals the effect of different heteroatom doping locations on the catalytic activity and will provide a reference for the design of efficient photocatalysts with atomic-level fine structure.

TI Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived selenidation strategy to prepare
   porous (Zn, Cu)CoSex micro/nanostructures for
   sodium-ion batteries
SO RARE METALS
AB Owning to the wide distribution, low cost, and similar chemical-electrochemical properties with lithium, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted much attention during recent years and may have the potential to replace the commercial lithium-ion batteries. Herein, facile and simple bottom-up approach has been rationally applied to fabricate carbon-encapsulated ZnSe@CoSe2 microspheres and Cu2Se@CoSe2 nanocubes. The as-prepared ZnSe@CoSe2 microspheres and Cu2Se@CoSe2 nanocubes composites inherited the original structure of ZnCo-MOF and CuCo-MOF, respectively. Herein, both ZnSe@CoSe2 microspheres and Cu2Se@CoSe2 nanocubes delivered excellent electrochemical performance when presented as anode materials for SIBs. Both ZnSe@CoSe2 microspheres and Cu2Se@CoSe2 nanocubes electrode could display a long-term cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 525 and 423 mAh.g(-1) at the current density of 1 A.g(-1) after 500 cycles, respectively. Furthermore, even at a high current density of 5 A.g(-1), ZnSe@CoSe2 microsphere could still maintain 520 mAh.g(-1) after 500 cycles, demonstrating remarkable capacity and excellent cycling performance. Those high performances were beneficial from the unique hollow and porous structure of ZnSe@CoSe2 microspheres and Cu2Se@CoSe2 nanocubes derived from the precursor which facilitate the transport of sodium ions, contributing to high capacity, improved excellent cycle stability and rate capability.

SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We present herein the first in situ site-selective XAS experiment performed on a proof-of-principle transformation of a mixed-valence compound: the calcination of the K0.1Co4II[Co-III(CN)(6)](2.7)center dot 20H(2)O Prussian Blue analogue (containing Co2+ and Co3+ ions in two different O-h sites) into Co3O4 (containing Co2+ ions in a T-d site and Co3+ in an O-h site). By recording the Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra using a spectrometer aligned at the Co K beta(1,3) emission line, the evolution of each species was singly monitored from 20 degrees C up to the oxide formation. The experimental spectrum of the Co2+(T-d) and Co3+ (O-h) species in Co3O4 is reported for the first time. Our results demonstrate the possibilities offered by site-selective XAS for the investigation of chemical transformations and the study of materials under working conditions whenever the chemical element of interest is present in several states and/or sites.

TI MOF-Derived Porous Ternary Nickel Iron Nitride Nanocube as a Functional
   Catalyst toward Water Splitting Hydrogen Evolution for Solar to Chemical
   Energy Conversion
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived porous ternary metallic nitride (Ni3FeN) has been successfully prepared through a simple two-step oxidation-rapid n itr ida ti on process and used for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The porous structure of the Ni3FeN nanocube contributes to the adsorption of the Eosin-Y photosensitizer, while also ensuring sufficient exposed active sites. This aids in improved reaction kinetics of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the superior conductivity of ternary Ni3FeN promotes the transfer of charge carriers excited from Eosin-Y, which also promotes the photocatalytic performances of Ni3FeN/Eosin-Y systems. When used with Eosin-Y as a dye photosensitizer, the porous ternary Ni3FeN nanocube exhibits superior performance, which is more than 3.45, 3.83, and 1.31 times higher than that of the PBA, NiFeOx, and Prussian blue-derived Fe3N samples. The Ni3FeN catalyst exhibits an optimal H-2 production rate of 16.96 mmol g(-1) h(-1), with an apparent quantum efficiency of similar to 3.03% at 520 nm excitation wavelength.

TI Reverse microemulsion synthesis of nickel-cobalt
   hexacyanoferrate/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites for
   high-performance supercapacitors and sodium ion batteries
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue analogues with tunable open channels are of fundamental and technological importance for energy storage systems. Herein, a novel facile synthesis of nickel-cobalt hexacyanoferrate/reduced graphene oxide (denoted as Ni-CoHCF/rGO) nanocomposite is realized by a reverse microemulsion method. The very fine Ni-CoHCF nanoparticles (10-20 nm) are homogeneously anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide by electrostatic adsorption and reduced graphene oxide is well-separated by Ni-CoHCF particles. Benefiting from the combined advantages of this structure, the Ni-. It CoHCF/rGO nanocomposite can be used as electrodes for both supercapacitors and sodium ion batteries exhibits excellent pseudocapacitve performance in terms of high specific capacitance of 466 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and 350 F g(-1) at 10 A g(-1), along with high cycling stabilities. As a cathode material for sodium ion batteries, it also demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 118 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), good rate capability, and superior cycling stability. These results suggest its potential as an efficient electrode for high-performance energy storage and renewable delivery devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of the variation of metal substitution and electrolyte on the
   electrochemical reaction of metal hexacyanoferrates
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs), also called Prussian blue analogs, are known as electrochemical electrodes and are ion-adsorbent. To investigate the effect of the ionic radius of the adsorbate (cations adsorbed upon reduction) and the pore size of the adsorbent (porous electrode that stores cations upon reduction), we investigated the electrochemical reactions with various alkali cations and by changing the metal sites of the MHCFs. First, we succeeded in controlling the pore sizes of the MHCFs, where the lattice constant a could be estimated as a = 0.98D(sum) + 7.21, where D-sum represented the sum of the ionic diameters of the metal M and Fe. Concerning the electrochemical reaction, the redox potential increased when the hydration energy of the adsorbate decreased, implying that the hydration energy of the adsorbate affected the stability of the reduced state. With cadmium hexacyanoferrate, which has a large pore size, the variation of the redox potential was suppressed in comparison to that with copper hexacyanoferrate, which has a small pore size. With Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) analysis before and after the redox reactions, Na+ insertion accompanied by H2O was presumed in the reduced state.

TI Contemporaneous inverse manipulation of the valence configuration to

   electrocatalysis
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Valence configurations of active sites are essential for modulating the electronic structure of the non-noble metal electrocatalysts in water splitting. However, synchronously engineering the valence states of different elements to inverse ones has been a key challenge in the integrated synthesis environment. Herein, for the first time, a novel superstructure of inverse spinel NiCoFe oxide nanocubes with contemporaneous valence regulation to preferred Co2+ and Ni3+ ((NiCoFe)-Co-III-Fe-II-O@NF, NF stands for nickel foam), has been developed by in situ topotactic chemical transformation. (NiCoII)-Co-III Fe-O@NF can attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.455 V in 1 M KOH when used as bifunctional catalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the favorable Co2+ and Ni3+ act synergistically to lower down Delta G(H)* for HER and the OER overpotential in an optimal pathway. Our study probes the construction and understanding of the heterogeneous valence configuration in a single phase.

TI Hierarchical polyhedron K2CoFe(CN)6 as promising
   cathode for rechargeable batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The electrochemical performance of Prussian blue and its analogues is affected by their structure and thus it is necessary to search for appropriate synthetic strategies to decrease the vacancies in the framework. A low-defect and high-crystal K2CoFe(CN)(6) with hierarchically polyhedral structure has been successfully synthesized by a facile coprecipitation method with controlling the nucleation rate. It has a well-defined structure, which can provide large channels for ion insertion/extraction. Benefiting from the kinetics optimization, the polyhedral K2CoFe(CN)(6) delivers a discharge capability of 102 mAh g(-1) at 20 mA g(-1) over 200 cycles and even remains 86 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles with capacity retention as high as 93% for Na-ion batteries. Moreover, this material as cathode is extended to Li-ion batteries and aqueous Na-ion batteries and also exhibits superior electrochemical performance. It capably keeps 92% and 85% retention after 200 cycles at 20 mA g(-1), respectively. Thus, this green material with superior electrochemical performance could be extended to more widespread storage applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Electronic and vacancy engineering of ruthenium doped hollow-structured
   NiO/Co3O4 nanoreactors for low-barrier electrochemical urea-assisted
   energy-saving hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Discovering a valid approach to achieve a novel and efficient water splitting catalyst is essential for the development of hydrogen energy technology. Herein, unique hollow-structured ruthenium (Ru)-doped nickel-cobalt oxide (Ru-NiO/Co3O4/NF) nanocube arrays are fabricated as high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/urea oxidation reaction (UOR) through combined electronic and vacancy engineering. The structural characterization and experimental results indicate that the doping of Ru can not only effectively modulate the electronic structure of Ru-NiO/Co3O4/NF, but also increase the content of oxygen vacancies in the structure of Ru-NiO/Co3O4/NF to stabilize the existence of oxygen vacancies during the catalytic process. This can optimize the adsorption and desorption of the reactive intermediates on the surface of Ru-NiO/ Co3O4/NF and dramatically accelerate the HER and UOR kinetics. As a result, the Ru-NiO/Co3O4/NF hollow structure nanocube arrays exhibit overpotentials of 21 and 60 mV for HER, as well as potentials of 1.36 and 1.42 V for UOR at 10 and 100 mA cm- 2, respectively. Furthermore, the coupled HER and UOR system requires only 1.59 V of cell voltage to drive a current density of 100 mA cm- 2, which is approximately 240 mV lower than conventional water electrolysis. This work provides a tremendous promise for the development of novel and high-activity electrocatalysts in future energy conversion applications.

TI Interface engineered NiFe2O4-x/NiMoO4
   nanowire arrays for electrochemical oxygen evolution
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Designing highly active and stable electmcatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key to success in sustainable water splitting reaction, a sustainable route towards high purity hydrogen production. Interface engineering is one of the most effective strategies for modulating the local electronic structure of active sites to enhance catalytic activity. Herein, NiFe2O4-x nanoparticles were integrated to NiMoO4 nanowires (NiFe2O4-x/NMO) grown on nickel foam to construct an extended interface with strong electronic interactions. The NiFe2O4-x/NMO demonstrates high OER activities as manifested by a low overpotential of 326 mV at a high current density of 600 mA cm(-2) and good long-term stability. The intimate interface between NiFe2O4-x and NiMoO4 is responsible for the Fe-facilitated phase transition to active gamma-NiOOH phase as revealed by in situ Raman spectmelectrochemical studies. This study outlines how the interface design of integrated nanostructures can optimize the formation of active phase for enhanced catalytic activity.

TI Co-precipitation synthesis of nickel cobalt hexacyanoferrate for
   binder-free high-performance supercapacitor electrodes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Prussian blue analogue with a typical metal-organic framework has been widely used as an electrode material in supercapacitor. In this work, nickel cobalt hexacyanoferrate (Ni2CoHCF) was grown on nickel foam directly using a simple co-precipitation method. The as-prepared Ni2CoHCF was tested by transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and X-ray electron energy spectrum. The results showed that Ni2CoHCF has a unique open face-centered cubic structure. The Ni2CoHCF was used to set an asymmetric supercapacitor directly. A series of electrochemical tests showed that Ni2CoHCF had an excellent electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor was 585 C g(-1) (1300.0 F g(-1), 162.5 mAh g(-1)) at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1). After 2000 cycles, it still maintained 85.57% of its initial specific capacitance at the current density of 10 A g(-1). The energy density was 30.59 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 378.7 W kg(-1). The results show that the supercapacitor constructed by Ni2CoHCF as an electrode material has high-current charge-discharge capacity, high energy density and long cycle life.

TI High-Performance Aqueous Rechargeable K/Zn Hybrid Batteries Based on
   Berlin Green Cathode Materials
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Aqueous rechargeable zinc-based batteries with the advantages of sustainability, safety, and low cost, are suitable for large-scale electrochemical energy storage applications. In this work, aqueous zinc-based batteries with low defect Berlin green (FeHCF) cathode, a hybrid zinc triflate and potassium triflate electrolyte, and zinc anodes are developed. In the hybrid electrolyte, the K+ ions with the weak solvation effect and small electrostatic interaction are the dominant intercalation species in the FeHCF, resulting in the fast charge transfer process and rapid diffusion kinetics. The Zn2+ ions stay at the surface rather than penetrate into the bulk phase. Thus, the hybrid batteries deliver a high specific capacity of 169.2 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), excellent rate performance with 45.7 mAh g(-1) at 6 A g(-1), and good long-term cyclability with a capacity retention of 57 % over 1000 cycles at 1 A g(-1). The results suggest using aqueous K/Zn hybrid electrolytes can improve the electrochemical performance of FeHCF.

TI Indicator-catalyst displacement assay for tandem detection and signal
   amplification of dimethoate organophosphate pesticide
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB This paper describes the chemosensing and catalytic amplification properties of [MnIII(TPP)(NCS)]-[PdII(DMSO) Cl2] (1, TPP = 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine) for detecting the organophosphate pesticide dimethoate. Complex 1 selectively detects dimethoate, resulting in a visual color change from yellowish-brown to green with a UV-vis spectroscopic method detection limit (MDL) of 22.7 mu M. This selectivity is attributed to the formation of a more stable PdII(dimethoate)2Cl2 adduct, resulting in the release of the colored MnIII(TPP) (NCS) unit from complex 1. Interestingly, the free PdII(dimethoate)2Cl2 released acts as a catalyst for the Heck coupling reaction of 5-diethylamino-2-iodo-phenyl ester (2), producing the highly fluorescent 7-diethylaminocoumarin (3). This catalytic process results in significant signal amplification, enhancing the original sensitivity by 25 times, with a spectrofluorimetric MDL of 0.9 mu M. The proposed indicator-catalyst displacement assay successfully quantifies dimethoate concentrations in natural water samples, exhibiting good recoveries (92.5-108.1%) and low relative standard deviations (1.2-6.2%).

TI Phosphorus modified hollow, porous Nickel-Cobalt oxides nanocubes with
   heterostructure for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The development of efficient non-noble-metal based catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is the crucial issue to promote electrolytic water technology. Herein, an effective phosphorus-modified hollow porous Nickel-Cobalt oxides nanocube was prepared by thermal oxidation and partial phosphorization processes. The optimal P-NiO/NiCo2O4 nanocube disclosed remarkable electrochemical activity for OER in 1.0 M KOH with a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 49.6 mV dec-1, and good long-life stability for 20 h. Based on the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the introduction of P was proved to be the key to the excellent electrochemical activity for OER. P doping could optimize the ad-sorption of the intermediates, decrease the energy barrier and change the rate-determining step. Meanwhile, the P-dopant could modulate the electronic structure and enhance the conductivity of NiO/ NiCo2O4. In addition, hollow, porous hybrid structure and oxygen vacancies could increase the number of active sites exposed, and facilitate the ion transport. The present work provides a valuable strategy to design transition-metal oxide based electrocatalysts with enhanced electrocatalytic performances by controlling partial P doping.

TI Hollow nanopompoms engineered via a weak-strong coetching strategy for
   high-performance electrocatalysts
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The rational structure and composition design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) is crucial for rechargeable metal-air batteries. Here, we report controlled structural transitions of metal-organic frameworks through a weak-strong competitive coordination strategy for high-performance electrocatalysts. Upon the introduction of potassium ferricyanide (PF) and/or phosphomolybdic acid (POM), cubic zeolitic-imidazole framework-67 (Cube-67) undergoes both chemical and macroscopic morphology changes, i.e., from nanocubes to hollow nanopompoms, where PF and POM act as the weak chelator (i.e., for finer structures) and the strong chelator (i.e., shape-directing agent), respectively. After calcination, the hierarchically structured nanopompoms display tunable and high-performance OER and ORR catalytic activities suitable for Zn-air batteries that display a long-term charge-discharge cycling stability. This work not only holds promise for clean-energy applications but provides a design principle for engineering advanced electrocatalysts by effectively tuning their structural and chemical properties.

SO CARBON
AB Broadband microwave absorbing (MA) materials have important applications in reducing electromagnetic radiation pollution and realizing low scattering characteristics. However, current MA materials with single-layer structure generally cannot meet this requirement due to the difficulty in achieving good impedance matching. Here, we design a multilayer-structured MA material, which consists of a wave transmitting layer, a carbon-magnetic material composite absorbing layer, a strong magnetic absorbing layer and a reflector layer. Hollow Co/CoFe@C composite particles prepared using CoCoPBA as templates are used as fillers to design carbon-magnetic material composite absorbing layer. The Co/CoFe bimagnetic phases enhance permeability while the hollow structure optimizes permittivity, which endows this absorbing layer with strong microwave absorption ability with a reflection loss of -47.18 dB. The introduction of a strong magnetic absorbing layer that combines FeSiAl with high permeability and SmFeB with high coercivity further significantly improves the overall impedance matching of the material. Benefitting from the multi-scale structural design, the obtained multilayer MA material achieves strong microwave absorption in both low and high frequency ranges, and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 12.85 GHz, far superior to the traditional single-layer MA material.

TI Highly crystalline nickel hexacyanoferrate as a long-life cathode
   material for sodium-ion batteries
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are attractive cathode candidates for high energy density, including long life-cycle rechargeable batteries, due to their non-toxicity, facile synthesis techniques and low cost. Nevertheless, traditionally synthesized PBAs tend to have a flawed crystal structure with a large amount of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-)openings and the presence of crystal water in the framework; therefore the specific capacity achieved has continuously been low with poor cycling stability. Herein, we demonstrate low-defect and sodium-enriched nickel hexacyanoferrate nanocrystals synthesized by a facile low-speed co-precipitation technique assisted by a chelating agent to overcome these problems. As a consequence, the prepared high-quality nickel hexacyanoferrate (HQ-NiHCF) exhibited a high specific capacity of 80 mA h g(-1)at 15 mA g(-1)(with a theoretical capacity of similar to 85 mA h g(-1)), maintaining a notable cycling stability (78 mA h g(-1)at 170 mA g(-1)current density) without noticeable fading in capacity retention after 1200 cycles. This low-speed synthesis strategy for PBA-based electrode materials could be also extended to other energy storage materials to fabricate high-performance rechargeable batteries.

TI Design of 2D Nanocrystalline Fe2Ni2N Coated onto
   Graphene Nanohybrid Sheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen
   Evolution
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB We report successfully synthesizing two-dimensional (2D) and nanocrystalline (NC) Fe2Ni2N/rGO nanohybrid sheets (NHSs) via ammonolysis of as-prepared 2D Ni2.25Fe0.75[Fe(CN)(6)](2)/rGO precursors. We compared the electrochemical properties of the 2D-NC Fe2Ni2N/rGO NHSs as non-precious-metal nitride and graphene nanohybrid electrocatalysts for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with those of NiFe-based composition. The overpotential and Tafel plot of the 2D-NC Fe2Ni2N/rGO NHSs had their lowest values of 290 and 49.1 mV dec(-1), respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (0.1 M, KOH). The 2D-NC Fe2Ni2N/rGO NHS catalyst was stable under OER conditions, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed the stability of the catalysts after electrochemical testing (24 h). The synergistic interactions between the transition-metal nitride and graphene represent unique 2D nanostructured, metallic properties, and graphene sheets with nanocrystalline Fe2Ni2N on them are significantly more efficient and active electrocatalysts. The presented strategy of transition-metal nitride/graphene hybrid nanostructures provides potential for more efficient and outstanding OER electrocatalysts.

Herein, porous Mo-doped CoFeP/nitrogen doped carbon (NC) nanocubes were constructed via phosphiding Mo-doped CoFe-Prussian blue analogue. As-obtained Mo-doped CoFeP/NC exhibits excellent HER activity, which requires an overpotential of 145 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 and exhibits a small Tafel slope of 68 mVmiddotdec-1, indicating that doping of the Mo could suitably modulate the electronic structure of CoFeP/NC nanocubes.

TI In-Situ Construction of Fe-Doped NiOOH on the 3D Ni(OH)2
   Hierarchical Nanosheet Array for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen
   Evolution Reaction
SO MATERIALS
AB Accessible and superior electrocatalysts to overcome the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are pivotal for sustainable and low-cost hydrogen production through electrocatalytic water splitting. The iron and nickel oxohydroxide complexes are regarded as the most promising OER electrocatalyst attributed to their inexpensive costs, easy preparation, and robust stability. In particular, the Fe-doped NiOOH is widely deemed to be superior constituents for OER in an alkaline environment. However, the facile construction of robust Fe-doped NiOOH electrocatalysts is still a great challenge. Herein, we report the facile construction of Fe-doped NiOOH on Ni(OH)(2) hierarchical nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam (FeNi@NiA) as efficient OER electrocatalysts through a facile in-situ electrochemical activation of FeNi-based Prussian blue analogues (PBA) derived from Ni(OH)(2). The resultant FeNi@NiA heterostructure shows high intrinsic activity for OER due to the modulation of the overall electronic energy state and the electrical conductivity. Importantly, the electrochemical measurement revealed that FeNi@NiA exhibits a low overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) with a small Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming the commercial RuO2 electrocatalysts for OER.

TI Effects of chelating agent on the nanostructure of nickel
   hexacyanoferrate and its performance in seawater battery application
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB With the increasing demand for cost-effective and safe energy storage systems, seawater batteries (SWBs) are establishing themselves in the field of rechargeable batteries. In particular, cathode materials based on the intercalation mechanism have received considerable attention owing to their low overpotential and high energy efficiency. In this study, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) is used as an intercalation cathode material for SWB. NiHCF, a type of Prussian blue analog, has the advantages of a large interstitial volume to insert Na-ions and stability into seawater; however, it is often fabricated in a defect-rich structure. Therefore, the chelating effect of NiHCF is studied, and its structural and electrochemical properties are investigated. After introducing a chelating agent, defect-less NiHCF can be fabricated, and the well-constructed structure affects the electrochemical properties of the NiHCF. The structural behavior of NiHCF based on the insertion/extraction of Na-ions in the SWB full-cell is studied, and the chelated NiHCF cathode shows reversible cycling ability up to 2000 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.8%. This study offers a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical properties of NiHCF and the operating mechanisms of intercalation cathode materials in SWB systems.

TI Morphology-Dependent Electrochemical Performance of Zinc
   Hexacyanoferrate Cathode for Zinc-Ion Battery
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) which is a dimorphic (cubic or rhombohedral) Prussian blue analogue and can be intercalated by both monovalent and divalent ions, is a promising cathode material for rechargeable aqueous metal-ion batteries. In this paper, a simple co-precipitation method is developed to tune the particle morphology of ZnHCF by adjusting the dropping speed at room temperature. Three polyhedral ZnHCF particles, with cubooctahedral, truncated octahedral or octahedral shapes, are obtained at room temperature. Structural transformation from cubic phase of as-prepared ZnHCF to rhombohedral phase is observed by further dehydration of the sample at 70 degrees C, whereas the dehydrated ZnHCF crystals still hold the identical polyhedral shape as that of the cubic phase particles. Then the influence of shape and facets on electrochemical performance is studied for polyhedral ZnHCF with rhombohedral structure (RZnHCF). RZnHCF sample with cubooctahedral shape possesses the best rate capability and cyclic stability comparing with RZnHCF particles having truncated octahedral or octahedral shapes. Furthermore, the structure of cuboctahedron RZnHCF particles during electrochemical cycling has been monitored with ex situ X-ray diffraction to demonstrate the reversible zinc-ion intercalation mechanism.

TI Spherical Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx Magic
   Cube with Ultrahigh Water/Seawater Oxidation Efficiency
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The rational construction of earth-abundant and advanced electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extremely desired and significant to seawater electrolysis. Herein, by directly etching Ni3S2 nanosheets through potassium ferricyanide, a novel self-sacrificing template strategy is proposed to realize the in situ growth of NiFe-based Prussian blue analogs (NiFe PBA) on Ni3S2 in an interfacial redox reaction. The well-designed Ni3S2@NiFe PBA composite as precursor displays a unique spherical magic cube architecture composed of nanocubes, which even maintains after a phosphating treatment to obtain the derived Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx on nickel foam. Specifically, in alkaline seawater, the Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx as OER precatalyst marvelously realizes the ultralow overpotentials of 336 and 351 mV at large current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, with remarkable durability for over 225 h, outperforming most reported advanced OER electrocatalysts. Experimentally, a series of characterization results confirm the reconstruction behavior in the Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx surface, leading to the in situ formation of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni(Fe)OOH with abundant oxygen vacancies and grain boundaries, which constructs the Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx reconstruction system responsible for the remarkable OER catalytic activity. Theoretical calculation results further verify the enhanced OER activity for Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx reconstruction system, and unveil that the Fe-Ni2P/FeOOH as active origin contributes to the central OER activity.

TI Structural distortion-induced monoclinic sodium iron hexacyanoferrate as
   a high-performance electrode for rocking-chair desalination batteries
SO NANOSCALE
AB Sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (NaFeHCF) has been recognized as a promising Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-based electrode for electrochemical desalination; however, its application potential is limited by its unsatisfactory desalination capacity and cycling stability. Herein, the structurally distorted high-quality monoclinic NaFeHCF with fewer defects in the framework was synthesized by a crystal-controlled coprecipitation method via tuning the crystallization reaction conditions and applied to seawater desalination. Physicochemical characterization and desalination experiments show that the NFHFC-2 with minimized defects possesses enhanced electrochemical activity of Fe2+ and electrochemical kinetics, thus achieving higher desalination performance (specific capacity of 75.0 mA h g-1 and capacity retention of 85.3% after 50 cycles). Furthermore, a symmetrical NFHCF-2 RCDB is assembled, and the operation parameters (including various salinities and electrode spacing) are optimized to achieve a remarkable salt removal capacity (SRC) of 108.9 mg g-1 and a salt removal rate (SRR) of 2.22 mg g-1 min-1 with low energy consumption (0.056 kW h kg-1-NaCl) and outstanding cycling stability (almost no capacity attenuation in 150 cycles). Impressively, the RCDB further exhibits favorable technical feasibility in the simultaneous removal of univalent/bivalent ions from the natural seawater. This study inspires the design of high-quality PBA-based electrodes with optimized crystal structures for electrochemical desalination.
   This study reveals that structure distortion induced monoclinic NaFeHCF with minimized defects enables stable, rapid and low energy consumption desalination in rocking-chair desalination battery.

TI Manganese hexacyanoferrate/graphene cathodes for sodium-ion batteries
   with superior rate capability and ultralong cycle life
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Although Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) show promising potential applications as cathodes for sodium ion batteries, great challenges still remain to develop high-performance PBAs. In this work, we report the synthesis of high-performance manganese hexacyanoferrate/graphene (MnHCF/G) nanocomposites using a facile ball-milling route. It was found that after the ball-milling process, the MnHCF nanoparticles were pulverized into smaller grains that were uniformly anchored onto the few-layered graphene nanosheets. The product exhibits high capacity (142.7 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C), high working voltage (approximate to 3.7 V at 0.1C), superior rate capability (115.8 mA h g(-1) at 10C and 89.7 mA h g(-1) at 20C) and long cycle life (90.6% after 500 cycles at 1C, 91.8% after 1700 cycles at 5C, and 86.0% after 2000 cycles at 10C). The excellent electrochemical performance of MnHCF/G is ascribed to the small size of MnHCF and the conductive and protective effects of graphene. This work provides a practical method to synthesize high-performance PBA-based materials for sodium-ion batteries.

TI Understanding rhombohedral iron hexacyanoferrate with three different
   sodium positions for high power and long stability sodium-ion battery
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (NaFeHCF) has been considered as a potential cathode for sodium-ion batteries owing to its low-cost and easily prepared procedure. However, it is still challenging to achieve long cyclic stability and superior rate capability, and the sodium storage mechanism of sodium-rich NaFeHCF is still elusive. Herein, a sodium-rich NaFeHCF with rhombohedral structure is presented with excellent electrochemical performances within 2.0-4.2 V. The specific capacity of similar to 115 mA h g(-1) is obtained by utilizing two plateaus around 2.9 and 4.06 V, respectively. Remarkable rate performance from 10 to 4000 mA g(-1) and 1000 cycles with high capacity retention is achieved as well. Synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and structural refinement reveals that sodium-ions occupy three different sites (interstitial, face and edge) in rhombohedral unit cell, which contribute different capacities on different plateaus during Na+ extractions. Moreover, the rhombohedral structure is wellmaintained after long-term Na+ extractions/insertions and reversible phase transitions with small volume variation are observed through in-situ synchrotron PXRD. The kinetic properties of Na+ in rhombohedral unit cell are identified by ab-initio molecular dynamics method and density functional theory calculations, which indicate that Na+ transport on three-dimensional diffusion paths, thus enabling the outstanding rate performance of NaFeHCF.

The synthesized HEA, characterized by its highly conductive nature and reactive surface, demonstrates exceptional performance in capturing low-level nitrite (NO2-) in an electrolyte, which leads to its efficient conversion into ammonium (NH4+) with a Faradaic efficiency of 79.77% and N selectivity of 61.49% at -0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl. In addition, the HEA exhibits remarkable durability in the continuous nitrite reduction reaction (NO2-RR), converting 79.35% of the initial NO2- into NH4+ with an impressive yield of 1101.48 mu m h-1 cm-2. By employing advanced X-ray absorption and in situ electrochemical Raman techniques, this study provides insights into the indirect NO2-RR, highlighting the versatility and efficacy of HEA in sustainable electrochemical applications.

   Arrays as Cathodes for High-Voltage Flexible Aqueous Rechargeable
   Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Prussian blue analogs exhibit great promise for applications in aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (ARSIBs) due to their unique open framework and well-defined discharge voltage plateau. However, traditional coprecipitation methods cannot prepare self-standing electrodes to meet the needs of wearable energy storage devices. In this work, a water bath method is reported to grow microcube-like K2Zn3(Fe(CN)(6))(2)center dot 9H(2)O on carbon cloth (CC) using Zn nanosheet arrays as the zinc source and reducing agent, directly serving as a self-standing cathode. Benefiting from fast ion diffusion and high conductivity, the cathode delivers a high areal capacity of 0.76 mAh cm(-2) at 0.5 mA cm(-2) and excellent capacity retention of 57.9% as the current density increases to 20 mA cm(-2). By coupling with NaTi2(PO4)(3) grown on CC as an anode, a quasi-solid-state flexible ARSIB with a high output voltage plateau of 1.6 V is successfully assembled, exhibiting a superior areal capacity of 0.56 mAh cm(-2) and energy density of 0.92 mWh cm(-2). In particular, the device shows admirable mechanical flexibility, maintaining 90.3% of initial capacity after 3000 bending cycles. This work is anticipated to open a new avenue for the rational design of self-standing electrodes used in high-voltage flexible ARSIBs.

TI Turning Berlin green frameworks into cubic crystals for cathodes with
   high-rate capability
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been considered as promising host frameworks for charge carriers because of their well-defined diffusion channel along the 100 direction. Among PBA families, Berlin green (BG) would be an ideal cathode platform because the empty carrier ion sites and two redox couples (Fe3+/2+-CN-Fe3+/2+) in the BG framework can deliver high specific capacity during battery operation. Nonetheless, in most solution-based precipitation processes, BG crystals are synthesized in irregular shapes rather than in well-defined cube shapes, thus limiting their capacities at high rate operations. In this work, given the aforementioned challenges, a simple two-step precipitation process to synthesize cubic BG without using any chelating agents and toxic acids was reported. Notably, an intermediate phase was identified as an important stage in converting irregularly shaped BG to cubic BG by releasing crystal water molecules from the framework. Utilizing well-aligned 100 channels in the cubic framework, cubic BG exhibits excellent electrochemical properties as a cathode for lithium-ion batteries, delivering a specific capacity of 107.2 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 500 mA g(-1). A combined study of in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure analyses would provide a comprehensive structure-property relationship of BG cathodes.

TI Compact film fabrication of porous coordination polymer
   Co3[Co(CN)6]2 and its reversible
   vapochromic behavior
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Films of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) were fabricated on porous alpha-alumina, ITO glass, silicon wafer and non-woven fabric substrates via a facile self-assembly method, and were characterized using infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscope techniques. The films composed of truncated cube-shaped PBA particles are highly oriented with a preferred (100) plane on the glossy and smooth surfaces of ITO glass and silicon wafer, but crystallographically isotropic on the rough surface of porous alpha-alumina and non-woven fabric substrates. Compact films were achieved on porous alpha-alumina and surface-functionalized ITO glass. Reversible solvatochromism/vapochromism was discovered and investigated for the powdered and thin-film PBA samples. Such peculiar solvatochromism/vapochromism is related to the process of the adsorbed solvent molecules replacing the coordinated water molecules in octahedral Co2+-(N)(4)(H2O)(2). The change of the Co2+ ion's coordination atmosphere leads to the variation of crystal field strength, as a result, the d-d transitions within the Co2+ ions are altered to give rise to a color change.

TI Optimized photoelectric catalysis with enhanced durability in
   rGO-interconnected nanocarbon-confined cobalt nanoparticles
SO CARBON
AB Rational construction of the electrocatalytic centers is effective yet challenging for designing the highefficient-stable counter electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Herein, the Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived nanocarbon-confined cobalt nanoparticles were successfully interconnected by the reduced graphene oxide network (Co-NC@rGO-60 0), and employed as the CE. In this interconnecting-and-confining scenario, the ambient graphitic carbon-shell and rGO network not only establish a communicating charge transfer bridge, but also greatly hinder the corrosion of the cobalt core in iodine electrolyte, thus endowing the catalyst with fast reaction kinetics and fine durability. Simultaneously, the nanocarbon-concentrated cobalt active core ensures the composite extraordinary catalytic activity towards the triiodide/iodide redox couple. Finally, the DSSC fabricated with Co-NC@rGO-60 0 realized a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE 1/4 8.82%) than that of the commercial Pt-based DSSC (7.79%). These results deliver a new avenue to design the promising carbonaceous CE catalyst with optimized active centers, which may play a vital role in DSSCs and wider energy applications.

TI Crystallization-induced ultrafast Na-ion diffusion in nickel
   hexacyanoferrate for high-performance sodium-ion batteries
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted great interests due to their stable and open framework structures as novel electrode materials in rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, Na+ diffusion within electrode materials not only relates to many confined spaces formed by lattice frameworks for Na-ion storage but also highly involves with Na+ migration channel generated by lattice periodic arrangement. In this work, the correlation between PBAs crystallinity and Na+ insertion/extraction properties were systematically investigated. High-crystallized nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF-h) exhibits a fast Na-ion migration process with a high diffusion coefficient of 8.1 x 10(-)(10) cm(-2) s(-2), and a high capacity retention of 73.7% at 4.25 A g(-1). Even crystal size is six times larger than low-crystallized nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF-1), the high-crystallized NiHCF-h shows a faster Na+ insertion/extraction process. The basic structural characterization and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis show that NiHCF-h has a long-range lattice periodicity, enabling Na ions transfer more easily through migration channels. This demonstrates that the crystallinity of PBAs is an extremely important factor in ionic migration process, even with proved vacancies and H2O molecules in PBAs framework structure.

TI Fabrication of various metal hexacyanoferrates@CNF through
   acid-regulation for high-performance supercapacitor with superior
   stability
SO CARBON
AB Prussian blue analogs, as a pseudo-capacitor electrode materials hold great potential due to their unique framework structure, excellent electrochemical activity and high specific capacity. Herein, a versatile method for the growth of series of metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCF) on carbon nanofiber with high conductivity and flexibility was proposed. By controlling the releasing rate of metal ions through acid modulation of solution, the series of MHCF nanocubes were successfully embedded on the carbon nanofibers with super stability. Different MHCF presented various loading density. Among the MHCFs, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) is the most easily formed with high density and uniform distribution. The obtained self-supporting NiHCF@CNF, as a representative electrode, exhibited high specific capacitance (507 F g(-1), 1 A g(-1)) and remarkable rate performance (67% retention at 10 A g(-1)). Moreover, the NiHCF@CNF-based hybrid supercapacitor cell delivered a high energy density of 60 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 810 W kg(-1). Meanwhile, the capacitor showed extremely high stability due to tight anchoring of NiHCF on CNFs. This work provides a simple and versatile method to produce self-supporting MHCF@CNF composites for constructing high performance supercapacitor. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Electrochemical extraction of rubidium from salt lake by using cupric
   ferrocyanide based on potassium shuttle
SO DESALINATION
AB Extracting rubidium from high reserve salt lakes has been an important measure to cope with the growing demand for rubidium. However, due to the low concentration and high impurity ions in the salt lake, there was no rational method to extract rubidium. Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) with specific functional structures have shown good cycling stability for K+ and Rb+ with large ionic radii in the field of batteries and their special affinity (Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Rb+) for rubidium, which provides a new idea for the extraction of rubidium from salt lakes. In this paper, the cyclic electrochemical performance of synthesized copper ferricyanide (Cu3[Fe (CN)6]2) for rubidium was tested. Furthermore, a new method of rubidium extraction from salt lake was proposed by using potassium as the shuttle ion. The (K2Cu3[Fe (CN)6]2) obtained by intercalating K+ into copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu3[Fe (CN)6]2) with the electrochemical method was used to extract rubidium from simulated brine and the separation coefficients beta Rb: K, beta Rb: Na, beta Rb: Ca and beta Rb: Mg were 63, 1635, 585 and 2543, respectively. After that, rubidium was deintercalated by electrochemical oxidization of Rb2Cu3[Fe (CN)6]2 and the deintercalated efficiency can be reached 98 %. Rubidium enrichment can be achieved by repeating the above process with regenerated materials.

TI Hierarchical microspheres constructed by
   NiCo2O4/NiO@C composite nanorods for lithium-ion
   batteries with enhanced reversible capacity and cycle performance
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB With the progress of society, people have higher and higher requirements for energy battery anode materials. Commercial graphite electrode is limited by its specific capacity and can no longer meet people's needs. As a result, it is urgent to study high-performance anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. In this work, the sea urchin-like Co-Co Prussian blue analogue@Ni-1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylate (Co-Co PBA@Ni-BTC) assembled from one-dimensional nanorods is prepared by a flexible one-step hydrothermal method using Co-Co PBA and Ni-BTC metal-organic frameworks as templates. Hierarchical microspheres constructed by nitrogen-doped carbon layer coated NiCo2O4/NiO composite nanorods (NiCo2O4/NiO@C) are further prepared by two-step calcination. After 200 cycles at a current density of 1 A g(-1), the capacity can be maintained at 1432.8 mAh g(-1) and the coulombic efficiency is up to 98.1%. When the current density reaches 5 A g(-1), its capacity can still be maintained at 894.3 mA h g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance comes from the one-dimensional nanostructure and highly uniform nitrogen-doped carbon coating. This work provides new ideas for the application of metal-organic framework materials in lithium-ion battery anode materials. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hierarchically nitrogen-doped carbon wrapped
   Ni0.6Fe0.4Se2 binary-metal selenide
   nanocubes with extraordinary rate performance and high pseudocapacitive
   contribution for sodium-ion anodes
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Because of their considerable theoretical capacity and intrinsic conductivity, transition metal selenides have been considered as advanced electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, fast capacity fade and inferior rate performance still impede their large-scale application. Herein, a hierarchically nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) wrapped binary transition metal selenide (Ni0.6Fe0.4Se2@NC, termed NFS@NC) nanomaterial derived from polydopamine coated Prussian blue analogs (Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), Ni-F-PBA) was synthesized through a low-energy selenization and carbonization process. The excellent morphology, large surface area, intimate contact of nanoparticles with the carbon matrix and better combination of binary metal selenides can achieve outstanding sodium storage performance through their synergy. Notably, nitrogen-containing compound are efficiently converted to nitrogen-doped carbon with functional Fe-N-C bonds, facilitating the faster transfer of Na+. As a result, the as-obtained NFS@NC showed superior rate performance (449.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and 289.5 mA h g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)) and stable long-term cyclability (372.4 mA h g(-1) after 2000 cycles at 5 A g(-1)) as an anode material for SIBs. Kinetic analysis showed that the excellent Na-storage performance of the NFS@NC anode was mainly due to the large pseudocapacitive contribution resulting from the unique nano-multilevel composite structure.

TI Regulation of low-spin Fe of Mn-iron hexacyanoferrate for boosted
   potassium ion storage performance
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB K2Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] (KFHCF) is promising cathode material for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). However, it suffers from limited capacity, poor cycling, and rate capability during cycling. Here, the low-spin Fe species coordinated with carbon atoms from cyanogen ligands (Fe-LS-C) are regulated and activated by manganese (Mn) substitution. The regulation is systematically investigated through theoretical simulation and experiments. The original electron configuration (t(2)(6)e(0)(g)) of Fe-LS-C is changed with appropriate Mn-substitution (t(2)(3)e(g)(2)), which improves the utilization of Fe-LS-C, accelerates the redox charge transfer and enhances the electrical conductivity of the material. The resultant K2Mn0.1Te0.9[Fe(CN)(6)] (KMFHCF-0.1) delivers an improved reversible capacity of 135 mAh.g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) while the capacity of pure KFHCF is only 118 mAM g(-1). It also demonstrates excellent rate performance (76 mAM g(-1) at 800 mA.g(-1)) and long cycling stability (0.3% capacity degradation per cycle over 200 cycles). Ex-situ measurements verify that the cathode undergoes a highly reversible solid solution process during K-ions insertion/extraction.

TI Enhancing Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides by Hollow Bimetallic
   Oxide-Based Heterostructure Nanocages for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Performance improvement of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is restricted by the dissolution and shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) and their derived nanomaterials are ideal sulfur-fixing materials owing to their abilities to anchor LiPSs, accelerate redox conversion, and smooth Li2S precipitation. Herein, the hollow CoxFe3-xO4 heterostructure nanocages with highly interconnected pore architecture obtained by a PBA-assisted strategy are synthesized to overcome the abovementioned obstructions of LSBs. It is found that the bimetallic oxide-based heterostructure can not only inhibit LiPS diffusion via forming metal-sulfur bonds but also accelerate the LiPS conversion kinetics. Meanwhile, the hollow porous structure contributes to the physical confinement of LiPSs and acts as a buffer for the volume change. Thereby, the rate capability and cycling stability of hollow CoxFe3-xO4@S composite electrodes have been improved significantly. As a result, the hollow CoxFe3-xO4@S cell displays an excellent initial capacity of 1301.6 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). Even at 1 A g(-1), it exhibits an outstanding initial capacity of 898.9 mAh g(-1) with a negligible capacity loss rate, which is only 0.106% per cycle after 500 cycles. This work provides a new perspective for the construction and design of multifunctional hollow heterostructure materials for more efficient and stable LSBs.

TI Recent Progress and Perspective: Na Ion Batteries Used at Low
   Temperatures
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB With the rapid development of electric power, lithium materials, as a rare metal material, will be used up in 50 years. Sodium, in the same main group as lithium in the periodic table, is abundant in earth's surface. However, in the study of sodium-ion batteries, there are still problems with their low-temperature performance. Its influencing factors mainly include three parts: cathode material, anode material, and electrolyte. In the cathode, there are Prussian blue and Prussian blue analogues, layered oxides, and polyanionic-type cathodes in four parts, as this paper discusses. However, in the anode, there is hard carbon, amorphous selenium, metal selenides, and the NaTi2(PO4)(3) anode. Then, we divide the electrolyte into four parts: organic electrolytes; ionic liquid electrolytes; aqueous electrolytes; and solid-state electrolytes. Here, we aim to find electrode materials with a high specific capacity of charge and discharge at lower temperatures. Meanwhile, high-electrical-potential cathode materials and low-potential anode materials are also found. Furthermore, their stability in air and performance degradation in full cells and half-cells are analyzed. As for the electrolyte, despite the aspects mentioned above, its electrical conductivity in low temperatures is also reported.

TI Highly efficient improvement of power generation and waste removal in
   microbial fuel cell by associating activated carbon with a novel porous
   iron-nitrogen-doped carbon nanosphere
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The inefficient activated carbon (AC) air-cathode microbial fuel cell (MFC) is greatly constrained by the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which requires highly active and cost-effective catalysts to expedite the reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose an accessible and scalable method to prepare porous iron-nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (FFC/NG) by utilizing the inexpensive zinc-iron Prussian blue analogue as the precursor. Physicochemical characterization indicates that the evaporation of Zn is helpful to promote the surface area and mesopores volume. The maximum power density for the optimal sample (FFC/NG@AC-3) is 1913 +/- 39 mW m- 2, which is 200.3% higher than that of the bared AC and also outperforms the performance of the commercial Pt/C. The removing rate of chemical oxygen demand (COD) for FFC/NG@AC-3 can reach 80.2% after 72 h, 13.6% higher than that of bared AC. Density functional theory (DFT) confirms that the carbon atoms adjacent to graphitic nitrogen and pyridinic nitrogen on the graphene shell contribute to enhancing the oxygen adsorption energy. It can be well concluded that due to low cost, facile synthesis and remarkable performance, FFC/NG is a promising AC air-cathode modification reagent for MFC.

TI Electrochemical generation of hexacyanoferrate and hexacyanoruthanate
   electroactive films at nickel electrode surfaces: A promising synthetic
   approach for new electrode materials in metal ion batteries and
   supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been recently investigated as promising electrode materials for battery and supercapacitor applications. While most explorations have focused on PBA nanoparticles, very little attention has been focused on PBA films deposited on a metallic support. In this work, we have examined electrogenerating hexacyanoferrate (HCF) and hexacyanoruthenate (HCR) films on nickel surfaces via cyclic voltammetry. We found that the total material deposited was influenced by themetal cation present in the electrolyte solution and that, on average, the rate of deposition of the surface adsorbed/immobilized species was dependent on the species in solution. In particular, films electrogenerated in the presence of Na+ and K+ had the highest deposition rates. The cyclic voltammetric profiles exhibited dramatic differences depending on the cation present in the electrolyte solution. In addition, we found that all films were electrochemically irreversible in the presence of Li+ and Mg2+ containing electrolyte solutions. Further, and as a proof of concept, we modified high surface area nickel electrodes with HCF in sodium-based electrolytes, finding that these electrodes could operate reversibly at equivalent C-rates as high as 1667C.

TI Co3O4@SnO2/graphdiyne type-II
   heterojunction and p-n heterojunction jointly enhance photocatalytic
   hydrogen production: Co-O-Sn bond as a bridge for electron transfer
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Graphdiyne is a new two-dimensional carbon allotrope material with a two-site lattice co-hybridized by sp(2) and sp. Graphdiyne has a single-layer two-dimensional planar structure. Compared with graphene with zero band gap, graphdiyne has a band gap, inherent semiconductor characteristics, and excellent physical and chemical properties. In this study, we used a Prussian blue analogue (CoCo-PBA) as a precursor to form Co3O4 by calcination. Co3O4 containing a SnO2 shell was synthesized by calcining CoCo-PBA adsorbed with Sn4+. A Co-O-Sn bond was formed between the contact surfaces of SnO2 and Co3O4 as a fast transfer channel of photogenerated electrons. The ternary catalyst Co3O4@SnO2/graphdiyne (CSG) was constructed by combining Co3O4 with graphdiyne. Through high temperature calcination, the three components are intimately fused, and the resulting heterojunction enlarges the contact area and active sites, which is beneficial to the faster transfer of photogenerated carriers. The hydrogen production of the composite catalyst was as high as 113.63 mu mol in 5 hours, which was 51.66 times that of GDY and 6 times that of Co3O4. The in situ XPS shows the transfer direction of photogenerated electrons of the composite catalyst under visible light. In this study, a composite catalyst CSG-1.5 was derived from Prussian blue analogues, which maintained the strong redox ability of the photogenerated electron and hole pairs and more effectively promoted the transport of charge. It provides a new idea and possibility for the application of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts in water splitting to produce hydrogen.

TI CoFeP hierarchical nanoarrays supported on nitrogen-doped carbon
   nanofiber as efficient electrocatalyst for water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Developing high-efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts is significant for the overall water splitting. Bimetallic phosphides show great potential for the bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to the excellent catalytic performance. Herein, the CoFeP two-dimensional nanoarrays successfully grown on nitrogen doped electrospun carbon nanofibers (CoFeP NS@NCNF) through template-directed growth and following phosphorization treatment. Benefiting from the hierarchical nanoarrays structure, synergistic effect of high electrical conductivity carbon nanofiber substrate and bimetallic phosphide, the CoFeP NS@NCNF exhibits efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for OER and HER in 1 M KOH with overpotentials of 268 mV (eta(20)) and 113 mV (eta(10)), respectively. Moreover, the CoFeP NS@NCNF coupled two-electrode system needs a low voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. This work provides a promising way for the preparation of transition metal-based electrocatalysts with hierarchical structure derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) for OER and HER.

TI Nanozyme-Cellulose Hydrogel Composites Enabling Cascade Catalysis for
   the Colorimetric Detection of Glucose
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Catalytic cascades obtained from the combination of nanozymes, which are nanomaterials with enzyme-like activity, and natural enzymes have drawn much attention for biosensing and biomedical applications. A key consideration in the development of cascade reaction systems is the integration of nanozymes with enzymes to boost the overall catalytic performance. Here, we report an efficient one-pot approach for the preparation of an enzyme-nanozyme hydrogel composite for cascade catalysis. Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by using mild synthetic conditions in a cellulose-based hydrogel network in the presence of glucose oxidase (GOx), resulting in the simultaneous immobilization of PB NPs and active GOx in the hydrogel. This integrated system not only displays peroxidase-like activity relative to the PB NPs but also reveals an enhanced cascade catalytic performance for the colorimetric detection of glucose due to the proximity effect of the enzyme-nanozyme system within the hydrogel matrix. Compared to the analogue mixture with GOx in solution, the composite hydrogel shows enhanced glucose detection and improved stability. The developed colorimetric assay was successfully applied for the analysis of glucose in human serum samples, demonstrating its potential in clinical diagnosis. The versatility of this one-pot protocol holds promise for the development of different multienzyme systems, leading to efficient cascade catalysis for sensing applications.

TI Reversible Electrochemical Tuning of Ion Sieving in Coordination
   Polymers
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Membrane-based ion separation is environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and easy to integrate, being widely used in water desalination and purification systems. With the existing separation technologies, it is yet difficult to achieve real time, in situ, and reversible control of the separation process. Here, we design and fabricate a Prussian blue (PB) coordination polymer based membrane with uniform and electrochemically size-tunable subnanopores. The ion separation can be significantly and reversibly modulated through the electrochemical conversion between PB and Prussian white (PW). The permeation rates of small hydrated metal ions (Cs+ and K+) obviously increase upon switching from PB to PW, while the permeation rates of large hydrated metal ions (Li+, Na+, Mg2+, and La3+) remain constant. The membrane selectivity of small hydrated ions to large hydrated ions can be increased by more than 2 times during the electrochemical switch, which could be assigned to the slightly larger crystal size (e.g., pore window size) of PW than PB. The present approach provides a new strategy for constructing tunable seawater desalination and ion extraction systems.

TI Electrochemical kinetic energy harvesting mediated by ion solvation
   switching in two-immiscible liquid electrolyte
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Kinetic energy harvesting has significant potential, but current methods, such as friction and deformation-based systems, require high-frequency inputs and highly durable materials. We report an electrochemical system using a two-phase immiscible liquid electrolyte and Prussian blue analogue electrodes for harvesting low-frequency kinetic energy. This system converts translational kinetic energy from the displacement of electrodes between electrolyte phases into electrical energy, achieving a peak power of 6.4 +/- 0.08 mu W cm-2, with a peak voltage of 96 mV and peak current density of 183 mu A cm-2 using a 300 Omega load. This load is several thousand times smaller than those typically employed in conventional methods. The charge density reaches 2.73 mC cm-2, while the energy density is 116 mu J cm-2 during a harvesting cycle. Also, the system provides a continuous current flow of approximately 5 mu A cm-2 at 0.005 Hz for 23 cycles without performance decay. The driving force behind voltage generation is the difference in solvation Gibbs free energy between the two electrolyte phases. Additionally, we demonstrate the system's functionality in a microfluidic harvester, generating a maximum power density of 200 nW cm-2 by converting the kinetic energy to propel the electrolyte through the microfluidic channel into electricity.
   Kinetic energy harvesting often requires high-frequency inputs and durable materials. Here, the authors present an electrochemical system using immiscible liquid electrolytes and Prussian blue analogue electrodes to harvest low-frequency kinetic energy in a microfluidic device.

TI Ion-exchange surface modification enhances cycling stability and
   kinetics of sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate cathode in sodium-ion
   batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnHCF) with low cost and high energy density is a promising cathode in Na-ion batteries (NIBs); however, the Jahn-teller effect of Mn3+ and large amounts of Fe(CN)(6)(4-) defects significantly reduces the cycling life of the battery. Here, we introduce a chemically less soluble and structurally more stable layer to the NaMnHCF surface with a simple ion-exchange method to mitigate the irreversible structural change and side reactions associated with both the low-spin Fe-II(-)/Fe-III and the high-spin Mn-II/Mn(III )redox. The NaMnHCF cathode treated in Cu2+ solution shows much better cycling stability (80 vs. 30 mA h(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1 C) and rate performance than the unmodified NaMnHCF. The as-proposed chemical ion-exchange is a well-compatible and low-cost technology to realize surface modification of NaMnHCF and other hexacyanoferrates, which is of great significance for the development of high-performance NIB cathodes.

TI A Novel Asymmetric Diffusion Path for Superior Ion Dynamic in
   High-Voltage Mg-Based Hybrid Batteries
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Magnesium-based batteries have garnered significant attention due to their high energy density, excellent intrinsic safety, and low cost. However, the application process has been hindered by the high Mg2+ ions diffusion barrier in solid-state structures and solid-liquid interphase. To address this issue, a hybrid battery technology based on Mg anode and Fe-based Prussian Blue Analogue cathode doped with functional transition metal ions and N & boxH;O bonds is proposed. Combined multiscale experimental characterizations with theoretical calculations, the subtle lattice distortion can create an asymmetric diffusion path for the active ions, which enables reversible extraction with significantly reduced diffusion barriers achieved by synergistic doping. The optimized cathode exhibits a working potential of 2.3 V and an initial discharge capacity of 152 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1. With the preferred electrolyte combined with equivalent concentration [Mg2(mu -Cl)2(DME)4][AlCl4]2 and NaTFSI salt solution, the hybrid system demonstrates superior cycling performance over 200 cycles at a high current density of 200 mA g-1, maintaining approximate to 100% coulombic efficiency with superior ion dynamic. The findings are expected to be marked an important step in the further application of high-voltage cathodes for Mg-based hybrid batteries.
   To obtain a Mg-base hybrid battery with good dynamic performance, TFSI- ions are used as electrolyte additives to improve the electrochemical window and shorten the activation process. Meanwhile, an asymmetric diffusion path is created in the cathode structure by codoping of cations and N & boxH;O bond to achieve the superior Mg/Na ion storage electrochemical performance. image

TI Facile Fabrication of Melamine/MXene/FeNi-PBA Composite Derived
   Multi-Interface Magnetic Carbon Foam for High-Efficiency Microwave
   Absorption
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB The development of novel materials with high-efficiency microwave absorption is crucial for mitigating the adverse impacts of electromagnetic pollution. In this study, MXene and FeNi Prussian blue analogs (PBA) are assembled onto a melamine foam using self-assembly and in situ growth technique. Subsequently, magnetic carbon foam, comprising FeNi alloys, TiN and carbon with various morphologies, is synthesized via carbothermal reduction reaction. The surface morphology electromagnetic properties are significantly influenced by the pyrolysis temperature. The results revealed that the magnetic carbon foam composite demonstrated an effective microwave absorption bandwidth of 4.72 GHz at a thickness of only 1.5 mm, with a minimum reflection loss of -24.83 dB at 1.3 mm. The outstanding microwave absorption performance can be attributed to the 3D conductive network formed by N-doped carbon, as well as the contributions from polarization loss, magnetic loss, and suitable impedance matching. Furthermore, the corresponding absorber coating demonstrated a maximum reduction value of radar cross-section (RCS) by 13.16 dB m2. This research offers novel insights for the development of lightweight and efficient low-filled electromagnetic composite for broadband microwave absorption.
   Multi-interface magnetic carbon foams for high-efficiency microwave absorption are fabricated by carbothermal reduction utilizing melamine foam, MXene and FeNi-PBA as precursors. The excellent microwave absorption properties are attribute to the synergistic effect of the magnetic loss, dielectric loss and impedance matching. image

TI Inorganic cathode materials for potassium ion batteries
SO MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY
AB Potassium ion batteries have attracted much attention in the field of large-scale electrochemical energy storage due to their abundant resources, low cost, performance safety, and environmental non-toxicity. However, drawbacks such as large atomic weight and radius of potassium ion and short cycle life limit its practical application. The performance of cathode materials is a critical factor of the potassium ion battery, which directly affects the battery energy density, cycle life, and safety. Nevertheless, inorganic cathode materials play an important role in the research of potassium ion battery cathode materials. Herein, we review the current development of inorganic cathode materials targeting for the exploration and development of high-performance potassium ion batteries on introducing (i) inorganic cathode materials including Prussian blue and its analogs, layered metal oxides, and polyanionic inorganic materials, (ii) the crystal structure, storage mechanism and modification of electrode materials, (iii) the intrinsic relationship between material composition, structure and electrochemical performance. This review not only is an amalgamation of different viewpoints in reference works but also contains concise perspectives and strategies.

TI Combined Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Emissions for High-Throughput
   Optical Labels on Micrometer-Scale Objects
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB High-throughput optical labeling technologies have become increasingly important with the growing demands for molecular detection, disease diagnosis, and drug discovery. In this thought, a series of CN-bridged coordination polymer encapsulated gold nanoparticles have been developed as a universal and interference-free optical label through a facile and auxiliary agent-free self-assembly route. Moreover, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) emissions of CN-bridge can be tuned flexibly by simple replacement of Fe2+/Fe3+ with other metal ions relying on the synthesis of three Prussian blue analogues encapsulated gold nanoparticles (Au@PBA NPs). Thus, three distinct Raman frequencies have been acquired, which merely replaced the metal irons. On the basis of the potential supermultiplex optical label, space-confined surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) emissions have been realized. Relying on "Abbe theorem", the focused laser allows the pure and single triple bond-coded SERS emissions to be combined into a unique and independent output, so-called "combined SERS emission" (c-SERS), if the Au@PBA NPs were confined into one micrometer-scale object. This study demonstrated c-SERS may simultaneously provide 2(n) - 1 optical labels only using n single emissions in the Raman-silent region for micrometer-size objects.

TI Ultrafast Spin Crossover in a Room-Temperature Ferrimagnet:
   Element-Specific Spin Dynamics in Photoexcited Cobalt Ferrite
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Transition metal complexes capable of photoinduced spin crossover have been widely investigated because of their potential to enable ultrafast optical control of information processing. However, any real application of photoswitchable molecules requires that spin crossover be paired with additional functionality such as long-range magnetic order. Important advances combining these functions are notably reported for a number of bimetallic Prussian Blue analogues; however, to date, PBA-based magnetic photoswitches can only operate below 150 K due to loss of magnetic order. In contrast, cobalt ferrite is a ferrimagnetic semiconductor with a Curie temperature of 790 K and extremely favorable magnetic properties by comparison to state-of-the-art PBAs. The mixed valence electronic structure of cobalt ferrite is reminiscent of cobalt-iron PBA, which is a well-known photoswitch. To investigate the potential for photoswitching in this material, we employ transient XUV spectroscopy to probe charge and spin dynamics with element-specific resolution on the femtosecond time scale. Results show that 400 nm light excites a metal-to-metal charge transfer transition, which drives the crossover of high-spin Co2+ to low-spin Co3+ with a time constant of 405 +/- 29 fs and an internal quantum efficiency of unity. This result establishes the existence of efficient photoswitching in a new class of robust ferrimagnetic spinel ferrites.

TI Influence of the Thermal Treatment on the Structure and Cycle Life of
   Copper Hexacyanoferrate for Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries
SO BATTERIES-BASEL
AB Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) has become an attractive Zn2+ insertion material as a positive electrode in aqueous zinc-ion batteries thanks to its high reversibility towards Zn2+ (de-)insertion, its simple, inexpensive and easily scalable synthesis route, its low toxicity, and its high working potential. It is known that the physiochemical properties of CuHCF can be modified by manipulating its synthesis parameters. However, the effect of these parameters on the material's electrochemical performance and cycle life needs further investigation. Here, the structure and composition of CuHCF treated at different temperatures are studied through crystallographic, compositional, and thermogravimetric analyses. The resulting CuHCF powders were galvanostatically cycled to assess their electrochemical performance in relation to their annealing temperature. The results showed that the annealed CuHCF electrodes exhibited longer cycle life while maintaining a coulombic efficiency >= 99.5%. The longest cycle life was achieved by annealing the CuHCF electrodes at 100 degrees C.

TI Stimulus induced strain in spin transition heterostructures
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Strain is often used to alter material properties in applications ranging from bandgap tuning for semiconductor electronics to performing work through mechanical actuation. Spin transitions are accompanied by volume changes in the solid state and are being explored in actuation as a source of mechanical strain inducible by the many controllable stimuli known to trigger spin state changes. There is still much to understand, especially at small length scales, about how strain is transmitted from one material to another across a mechanically coupled interface. Theoretical efforts modeling spin-transition particles in a matrix provide significant insights, but this remains an area where systematic experimental studies are limited. This Perspective highlights the progress using cobalt hexacyanoferrate network solids, or Prussian blue analogues (CoFe-PBA), as a framework for investigating spin transition induced strain in nanometer scale and mesoscale heterostructures. Using a family of isostructural cyanometallate networks to form heterostructures with well-defined interfaces, measurements of the altered properties in response to strain generated by the thermally or optically induced spin state change of the CoFe-PBA provide the chance to experimentally interrogate factors that control interface transmitted strain.

TI Open-Framework Structure Based Cathode Materials Coupled with Metallic
   Anodes for Rechargeable Multivalent Ion Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent chemistry represent a promising avenue in grid-scale and portable energy storage devices, especially when multivalent metal with high energy density is used as the anode. Owing to the unique advantages of large 3D diffusion channels, multiple oxidation states of metal ions, and the ability to modulate the size of the intercalation channels for multivalent ions (Zn2+, Mg2+, Al2+, Ca2+) intercalation/deintercalation, open framework materials are regarded as ideal cathodes. Herein, this review firstly provides an introduction of recent open-framework structure based cathode materials including Prussian blue and its analogs (PB/PBAs), NASICONs, Zinc vanadate (zinc pyrovanadate, e.g., Zn3V2O7(OH)(2)2H(2)O and alpha-Zn2V2O7, zinc n-vanadate, e.g., Zn(OH)VO4), and Molybdenum-vanadium oxide (Mo2.5+yVO9+z) along with a presentation of their energy storage mechanisms. Afterwards, representative examples of such intercalated materials applied to multivalent ion batteries are considered. Some strategies to further improve the electrochemical performances of open-framework structure based cathode materials are also presented. Finally, the challenges and development directions of these materials in rechargeable multivalent ion battery systems are discussed.

TI Concentration gradient effect in liquid thermoelectric device composed

   K4[Fe(CN)6]/K3[Fe(CN)6]
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A liquid thermoelectric conversion device (LTE), which has a simple device structure composed of low-cost materials, is attracting attention. Here, we investigated the additive effect of methanol (MeOH), acetone, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) on an LTE composed of a K-4[Fe(CN)(6)]/K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] aqueous solution. We ascribed to the enhancement of the thermal voltage V and electrochemical Seebeck coefficient alpha to precipitation of K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] and resultant concentration gradient of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) between the hot and cold electrodes. The enhancement of V and alpha is quantitatively reproduced by the concentration gradient model incorporating experimentally-obtained solubility s(T) of K-4[Fe(CN)(6)]. We further demonstrated that precipitation enhances the maximum power by as much as 152% in a MeOH-added LTE composed of 0.35 M K-4[Fe(CN)(6)]/K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] aqueous solution at Delta T = 10 K.

TI Graphene aerogel encapsulated Co3O4 open-ended
   microcage anode with enhanced performance for lithium-ion batteries
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue analogues are receiving a great deal of attention on the field of energy storage materials. They can provide abundant active sites for the diffusion of various ions and their stable framework structure brings excellent cycling stability to the electrode. Despite this, their worse capacity retention and cycle life and the complexity of their electrochemical reaction mechanisms restrict their practical applications as the anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) seriously. In this work, graphene aerogel encapsulated Co3O4 open-ended microcage (Co3O4 microcages@GA) is synthesized via simply etching and hydrothermal methods. While applied as the anode for LIBs, the reversible capacity remained at 1439 mAh/g after 200 cycles (1 A/g), furthermore, even at a high current density of 10 A/g, the samples still reached a great capacity of 575.2 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance may be attributed to the enhancing conductivity of the material by the addition of graphene aerogel. Moreover, the enlarged surface area provided by the hollow cage structure also increases the reactive active sites, which is conducive to improving the reaction kinetics of the material so as to speed up the reaction and make the reaction more complete. The simple preparation method and the synergistic effect of reduced graphene oxide(rGO) and open-ended microcage structure give the material an ultra-high capacity retention rate and stability. Thus, Co3O4 microcages@GA has the potential as a promising anode material for LIBs.

TI Electron structure modulation and bicarbonate surrounding enhance
   Fenton-like reactions performance of Co-Co PBA
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Although several strategies have been developed to improve the efficiency of heterogeneous Fenton-like reactions, investigating the relationship among the electronic properties of the catalyst surface, the complex water matrix and catalytic activity remains challenges. Herein, the electron density of the active site Co(II) in Co Prussian blue analogs (Co-PBAs) is proved to be modulated by the anion source method. The elevated electron density of Co(II) and the higher metallicity of the catalyst lead to an increase in electron transport efficiency as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, the negative shift of the D-band center of Co(II) can effectively release intermediates to avoid catalyst poisoning. Bicarbonate has been demonstrated to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by weakening the peroxide bond. Its activation mechanism involves free radical mechanism and non-radical mechanism: the first step is the generation of HCO4-, then it is further hydrolyzed to generate center dot OH and( 1)O(2), and the other is HCO4- interact with Co(III) to form Co(IV)=O. In addition, the degradation pathways of target contaminants p-nitrophenol and toxicity verification of intermediate products have been investigated. This study provides guidance for the research of Fenton-like reactions.

TI Redox mediator enabling fast reaction kinetics and high utilization of
   iodine in aqueous iodine redox flow battery
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Aqueous iodine redox flow batteries (AIRFBs) have been identified as a promising technology for large-scale energy storage. However, practical capacity of AIRFBs is limited by the relatively low utilization of iodine caused by the low reaction kinetics. Here, we report an electrode modified by cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF), which supports a redox-mediating process developing alternative redox reaction pathways of iodine with reduced redox activation energies. Contributed by the strong adsorption of iodine by CoHCF, redox reaction kinetics of iodine species is accelerated, and the utilization of iodine in batteries is increased. Applying the CoHCF modified carbon felt as cathode electrode, the constructed zinc-iodine redox flow battery exhibits a high iodine utilization reaching 95.59% of the theoretical capacity at a current density of 20 mA cm- 2, which enhances 139.89% comparing to the battery without electrode modification. The redox mediator-based electrode enabling fast reaction kinetics and high utilization of iodine species offers a promising strategy enhancing the battery performance thereby advancing the development of AIRFBs.

TI Cubic core-shell structure of NiCoSx/CoS2
   as a high-efficiency tri-functional catalyst for Zn-air battery and
   overall water splitting
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB Cubic core-shell NiCoSx/CoS2 composite catalyst was successfully prepared on the basis of K-3[Co(CN)(6)]. First, Ni2+ is substituted for K+ in K-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) to prepare the binary metal ion precursor of Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2). Afterward, coating Co(OH)(2) on the surface of Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) could not only maintain the cubic structure of Prussian blue analogue but also build a composite interface between two phases. After the Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)/Co(OH)(2) precursor is sulfided, a porous NiCoSx/CoS2 composite catalyst material with a cubic structure is obtained. NiCoSx/CoS2 catalysts showed excellent oxygen evolution reactions and oxygen reduction reactions. The overpotential was only 310 mV to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and the half-wave potential can reach 0.80 V. During the exploration of the hydrogen evolution reaction, the catalyst exhibited 253 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2). When this catalyst was used in Zn-air batteries as the cathode, it showed excellent cycle stability (210 h) and small voltage gap (0.80 V) at 5 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, soft-pack flexible batteries assembled with NiCoSx/CoS2 can be charged and discharged stably at any bending angle.

TI Old Materials for New Functions: Recent Progress on Metal Cyanide Based

AB Cyanide is the simplest ligand with strong basicity to construct open frameworks including some of the oldest compounds reported in the history of coordination chemistry. Cyanide can form numerous cyanometallates with different transition metal ions showing diverse geometries. Rational design of robust extended networks is enabled by the strong bonding nature and high directionality of cyanide ligand. By virtue of a combination of cyanometallates and/or organic linkers, multifunctional framework materials can be targeted and readily synthesized for various applications, ranging from molecular adsorptions/separations to energy conversion and storage, and spin-crossover materials. External guest- and stimuli-responsive behaviors in cyanide-based materials are also highlighted for the development of the next-generation smart materials. In this review, an overview of the recent progress of cyanide-based multifunctional materials is presented to demonstrate the great potential of cyanide ligands in the development of modern coordination chemistry and material science.

TI Cobalt hexacyanoferrate supported on Sb-doped SnO2 as a
   non-noble catalyst for oxygen evolution in acidic medium
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB This study investigates the activity and stability of a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as an inexpensive anode catalyst for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE). While some PBAs have recently been reported to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolytes, the present study focuses on their integration in a PEMWE device. Cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles were interfaced with an electrically conductive support that withstands the PEMWE anodic conditions, namely Sb-doped SnO2. The OER activity of the composite materials was first verified in liquid electrolytes and then in PEMWE. A promising current density of 50-100 mA cm(-2) was reached at 2 V cell voltage. The PBA/Sb-SnO2 anode was stable up to 1.9 V, but showed more and more instability at higher potentials. Increasing leaching rates of Sn and Sb observed above 1.9 V suggest that the material instability above 1.9 V can mainly be assigned to Sb-doped SnO2 conductive support. These results are overall promising for the use of PBAs as catalytic sites at the anode of PEMWE. The study also identifies the need for more active PBAs in order to reach a higher current density at a cell voltage of 1.6-1.9 V, a potential range necessary for an acceptable energy efficiency of the PEMWE.

TI Sodium storage in Na-rich NaxFeFe (CN)6
   nanocubes
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Na-rich prussian blue analogues (PBS) with high coulombic efficiency are of fundamental and technological importance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here we report high-quality NaxFeFe(CN)(6) nanocubes as cathode materials for SIBs and investigate their sodium storage mechanism. Among them, Na-rich Na1.70FeFe(CN)(6) shows highly reversible electrochemical reactions, delivering a capacity as high as 120.7 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1); even at 1200 mA g(-1), the capacity still retains up to 73.6 mA h g (1). The first-cycle coulombic efficiency strongly depends on the sodium content in NxFeFe(CN)(6). Experimental results and first-principle calculations demonstrate that sodium cations in the large cavities of PBs have a priority to occupy the 8c site, while in the Na-rich samples, Na ions can be pushed into other 24d site. We believe that our findings can provide new insights into sodium storage mechanism for the PBs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Large negative thermal expansion in GdFe(CN)6 driven by unusual
   low-frequency modes
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB Understanding the negative thermal expansion (NTE) mechanism is of great importance. In this work, we consider the new NTE compound GdFe(CN)6 (alpha v = -34.2 x10-6 K-1) as a case study to investigate the NTE mechanism from the perspective of the lattice vibrational dynamics. The atomic mean-square displace-ments suggest that the NTE of GdFe(CN)6 comes from the strong tension effect induced by the transverse vibrations of the atomic -Fe-C equivalent to N-Gd- linkages, with the largest contribution given by N atoms. Lattice dynamics calculations show that three low-frequency optical modes at about 50 cm-1 show the largest negative Gruneisen parameters thus providing the largest contribution to the NTE. The existence of these unusual low-frequency vibrational modes can be ascribed to the presence of GdN6 trigonal prisms in the framework structure of GdFe(CN)6.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

TI Study on the Desalination and Regeneration Performance of PBA/AC
   Electrode Enhanced by MCDI
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY
AB The research focuses on desalting and regenerating wastewater using membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) systems with Prussian blue analog and activated carbon electrodes in batch experiments. The experimental results show that the optimized operational parameters for achieving superior deionization regeneration performance in membrane capacitors comprise a voltage magnitude of -1.6 V, a desorption flow rate of 30 mL min-1, and an electrode regeneration duration of 25 min. The MCDI system achieves a desorption amount of 45.87 mg g-1, a remarkable regeneration rate of 99.23 % under the optimized operating conditions. The MCDI system demonstrates a desorption amount and regeneration rate that are 22.56 mg g-1 and 17.47 % higher, respectively, compared to the traditional capacitive deionization system.
   In present manuscripts, the desalination and regeneration performance of membrane capacitive deionization systems with Prussian blue analog/activated carbon (PBA/AC) electrode were studied. The optimum operating conditions for achieving the highest desalination efficiency in the MCDI system were determined. At a voltage of 1.6 V, a flow rate of 30 mL min-1, and an electrode regeneration duration of 25 min, the MCDI system exhibited the highest desalination efficiency. The impact of capacitive deionization on adsorption-desorption efficiency under optimal desorption conditions in the MCDI desalination system was investigated. The adsorption behavior and regeneration effect of three CDI methods were compared. The adsorption capacity and desalination rate of MCDI surpass those of traditional CDI, with substantial enhancements of 17.71 mg g-1 and 14.17 %, respectively. image

TI High efficiency removal of Cs+ by Fe-Co framework PBAs from radioactive
   wastewater
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The widespread application of nuclear energy has increased the risk of contamination by radionuclide 137 Cs. Prussian blue analogues are considered to be excellent materials for the removal of 137 Cs from wastewater due to their unique structure. In this work, Cs+ + adsorbent for PBAs with Fe-Co framework, potassium iron hexacyanocobaltate (PBAFe), Fe ), was synthesized by room temperature precipitation method. Systematic structural characterization and performance results of PBAFe Fe showed that it has a specific surface area of 452.8 m2/g 2 /g and an average pore size of 8.6 nm, providing more active sites for Cs+. + . The adsorption of Cs+ + on PBAFe Fe exhibited fast reaction kinetics (within 10 min) and high adsorption capacity (82.90 mg/g), and the removal rate of Cs+ + reached 98.57 %. The efficient removal of Cs+ + by PBAFe Fe in various real water environments showed its excellent selectivity and potential for practical application. In addition, adsorption mechanism studies showed that the adsorption of Cs+ + was achieved by ion exchange with K+ + in the PBAFe Fe lattice. PBAFe Fe has the advantages of simple synthesis and good selectivity, and has potential application in the harmless treatment of Cs+ + in radioactive wastewater.

SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB The narrow voltage window of aqueous electrolytes hinders the energy density of aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a thermally and electrochemically stable hybrid electrolyte is developed with NaCF3SO3, 1,3-dioxolane (DOL), urea and H2O. The intermolecular interactions between DOL, urea and H2O regulate the hydrogen-bond network. Furthermore, the formation of an interfacial layer between the electrode and the electrolyte enables stable cycling of the manganese-based Prussian blue analogs (NaFeMnPBAs). As a result, a NaFeMnPBAs & Vert;NaTi2(PO4)3 full cell is constructed and it exhibits high energy density and superior stability in the hybrid electrolyte.

TI 3D Spatial Combination of CN Vacancy-Mediated NiFe-PBA with N-Doped
   Carbon Nanofibers Network Toward Free-Standing Bifunctional Electrode
   for Zn-Air Batteries
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Constructing flexible free-standing electrodes with efficient bifunctional performance is significant for improving the performance of flexible Zinc-air batteries. Herein, a flexible free-standing bifunctional electrode (N-2-NiFe-PBA/NCF/CC-60) is constructed by the 3D spatial combination of CN vacancy-mediated NiFe Prussian Blue Analogue (NiFe-PBA) and N-doped carbon nanofibers (NCF) rooted on carbon cloth (CC). The in situ formed CN vacancies by N-2-plasma activation tune the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Ni-Fe active sites in NiFe-PBA, thus improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic intrinsic activity, and restraining the loss of Fe element during OER process. The combination of NiFe-PBA and NCF presents a 3D interworking network structure, which exhibits a large specific surface and excellent electrical conductivity, thus guaranteeing sufficient, stable, and efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/OER active sites. Therefore, the N-2-NiFe-PBA/NCF/CC-60 electrode delivers high-efficiency OER activity with a low overpotential (270 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)) and excellent ORR performance with a positive potential of 0.89 V at 5 mA cm(-2). The N-2-NiFe-PBA/NCF/CC-60 based Zn-air batteries display outstanding discharge/charge stability for 2000 cycles. Meanwhile, the corresponding flexible Zn-air batteries with satisfactory mechanical properties exhibit a low voltage gap of 0.52 V at 1.0 mA cm(-2).

TI Fully Optical Control of Polarization Current Direction in a
   Cyanide-Bridged Trinuclear Complex
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB As a remote and non-contact stimulus, light offers the potential for manipulating the polarization of ferroelectric materials without physical contact. However, in current research, the non-contact write-read (erase) process lacks direct observation through the stable current as output signal. To address this limitation, we investigated the photoinduced polarization switching capabilities of the cyanide-bridged compound [Fe2Co] using visible light, leading to the achievement of rewritable polarization. By subjecting [Fe2Co] crystals to alternating irradiation with 785 nm and 532 nm light, the polarization changes exhibited a distinct square wave pattern, confirming the reliability of the writing and erasing processes. Initialization involved exposing specific crystal units to 532 nm light for storing "1" or "0" information, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785 nm light, resulting in brief current pulses for "1" states and no current signal for "0" states. This research unveils new possibilities for optical storage systems, paving the way for efficient and rewritable data storage and retrieval technologies, such as the next-generation memories.
   The polarization switching of the [Fe2Co] with photocurrent output was realized via reversible light-induced ETCST. Routing the photocurrent through an integrator yields a stable square wave signal, effectively mimicking the switching of a ferroelectric memory from "0" to "1". Specific crystal cells are exposed to 532 nm light for writing process, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785 nm light. image

TI Novel One-Pot Solvothermal Synthesis of High-Performance Copper
   Hexacyanoferrate for Cs<SUP>+</SUP> Removal from Wastewater
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Efficient removal of radioactive cesium from complex wastewater is a challenge. Unlike traditional precipitation and hydrothermal synthesis, a novel vast specific surface area adsorbent of copper hexacyanoferrates named EA-CuHCF was synthesized using a one-pot solvothermal method under the moderate ethanol media characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS, BET, and FTIR. It was found that the maximum adsorption capacity towards Cs+ was 452.5 mg/g, which is far higher than most of the reported Prussian blue analogues so far. Moreover, EA-CuHCF could effectively adsorb Cs+ at a wide pH range and low concentration of Cs+ in geothermal water within 30 minutes, and the removal rate of Cs+ was 92.1%. Finally, the separation factors between Cs+ and other competitive ions were higher than 553, and the distribution coefficient of Cs+ reached up to 2.343 x 10(4) mL/g. These properties suggest that EA-CuHCF synthesized by the solvothermal method has high capacity and selectivity and can be used as a candidate for Cs+ removal from wastewater.

TI Liquid Phase-Induced Solid Solution Phase Mechanisms for Highly Stable
   and Ultrafast Energy Storage
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Phase transitions induce large changes of the lattice parameters, and thus have negative effects on the electrochemical energy storage of electrode materials. In contrast, solid solution phase energy storage mechanisms can ensure smaller shrinkage/expansion of the structure, and therefore better cyclability and fast reaction kinetics of the electrode materials. In this work, the liquid phase is found to control the energy storage mechanisms of K2.55Zn3.08[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot 0.28H(2)O (KZnHCF). Via in situ characterization techniques, phase-transition and a solid solution phase hybrid mechanism with large chemical structural decay are observed in electrolytes with low K+ concentration, while only a solid solution phase type with a highly stable structure occurs in 5.0 m KCF3SO3 and 3.0 m KCF3SO3+2.0 m Zn(CF3SO3)(2) electrolytes. Consequently, the solid solution phase ionic storage mechanism ensures a high rate capability at 20 A g(-1) (capacity retention of 66.6%) and a long cyclability of 10 000 cycles (capacity retention of 93.7%) of the KZnHCF cathode.

TI Bidirectional Interface Protection of a Concentrated Electrolyte,
   Enabling High-Voltage and Long-Life Aqueous Zn Hybrid-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as a promising high-voltage cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are usually subjected to an ephemeral lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency due to the irreversible phase change and high Zn2+ insertion potential. Besides, Zn dendrites, H-2 evolution reaction, and corrosion derived from a Zn anode interface remain huge challenges. Given this, a highly stable zinc hexacyanoferrate (KZnHCF) cathode together with a mixed concentrated electrolyte is prepared to realize a high-voltage and long-life aqueous ZIB, in which the mixed concentrated electrolyte consisting of 30 m KFSI + 1 m Zn(CF3SO3)(2) possesses a unique Zn2+ solvation sheath (Zn(CF3SO3)(0.3)(FSI)(3.1)(H2O)(2.6)) that can not only stabilize the cathode interface and improve the Coulombic efficiency but also fundamentally solve the Zn anode interface issues. As a result, the aqueous KZnHCF/Zn battery achieves an ultralong life over 3000 cycles without any capacity decay even under a high discharge voltage of 1.78 V (vs Zn2+/Zn). Such extraordinary performance represents significant progress in aqueous PBA-based ZIBs. This work shares guidance to improve the performance of aqueous ZIBs through optimizing the electrolyte in tuning the stable operation of the cathode and the zinc anode.

TI Metal organic framework-based cathode materials for aqueous zinc-ion
   batteries: Recent advances and perspectives
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB With the widespread use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in recent decades, lithium resources are at risk of depletion. Electrochemical energy storage using LIBs cannot keep pace with socioeconomic development. Therefore, it is necessary to develop electrochemical systems capable of storing large amounts of energy in the future to replace LIBs. As a result of their environmental friendliness, low cost, and high safety, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) are potential replacements for LIBs. Several challenges remain for the commercialization of AZIBs, however, such as the development of high-performance cathodes. In recent years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related materials have evolved into potential cathode materials for AZIBs due to their high porosities, tunable structures, and multifunctionality. Hence, this review summarizes the latest progress in MOFbased cathode materials for AZIBs. We present and discuss different types of MOF-based electrode materials (vanadium/manganese-based MOFs and their derivatives, Prussian blue and its analogs, and other MOFs and their derivatives), focusing on the impacts of the structures and morphologies of MOF materials on AZIBs performance as well as investigating how zinc ions are stored. Finally, future developments of MOF-based materials for AZIBs are proposed. Our work is expected to spur innovative research into new MOF-based electrode materials for AZIBs and provide guidance for storing and converting energy in the future.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has received extensive attention because it is the key reaction for various electrochemical energy conversions, such as electrochemical water splitting. Transition -metal phosphides (TMPs) have been identified as potential OER electrocatalysts. However, it is a challenge to design and optimize the structure of TMPs to achieve high catalytic performance. Herein, the unique "nanonecklaces" electrocatalyst (NiFe-NiFeP@NC-NiFeP/CNT) comprised of carbon nanotube (CNT), NiFe-NiFeP particles with N-doped carbon layer coating, and NiFeP nanoparticles was successfully constructed. The experiment results demonstrate that the unique "nanonecklaces" structure provides excellent charge transfer channel, and the heterostructure adjusts the electronic structure of the catalyst, resulting in outstanding electrocatalytic activity. Additionally, the NC protective layer effectively prevents active site from corrosion and enhances the catalyst stability. Furthermore, the NiFeP adsorbed regulates the surface properties, which provides abundant surficial active sites, thus significantly improves the catalytic activity. Benefiting from these advantages, the optimized catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen evolution capability, reaching 10 (100) mA cm -2 at low overpotential of 214 (288) mV, and can electrolyze continuously for 120 h. This work presents a promising method for manipulating the component and nanostructure to design highly active and stable catalytic for OER.

TI Graphene encapsulated FexCoy
   nanocages derived from metal-organic frameworks as efficient activators
   for peroxymonosulfate
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A series of nitrogen-doped graphene encapsulated FexCoy bimetallic (FexCoy@C) nanocages were newly fabricated via a one-step thermal decomposition of Prussian blue analogue FeyCo1-y[Co(CN)(6)](0.67)center dot nH(2)O nanospheres at different temperatures. The as-synthesized FexCoy@C nanocages were systematically characterized and applied as effective catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA). The catalytic activity of Fe3Co7@C-650 obtained at 650 degrees C was found to be the highest and also much higher than that of metallic cobalt, cobalt oxide and cobalt-iron spinels. The nitrogen-doped graphene shells were demonstrated to be effective in preventing the release of metal ions, thus resulting in a better stability. Furthermore, the BPA degradation pathway was proposed based on GC-MS and LC-MS results. The involved radicals were identified through electron paramagnetic resonance and radical scavenger experiments. Based on the systematic characterization of the catalyst before and after the catalytic oxidation reaction, the overall mechanism of PMS activation over FexCoy@C nanocages was proposed. Results indicate that FexCoy@C nanocages are available to serve as promising materials for environmental remediation by activation of PMS.

TI Review and New Perspectives on Non-Layered Manganese Compounds as
   Electrode Material for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO MATERIALS
AB After more than 30 years of delay compared to lithium-ion batteries, sodium analogs are now emerging in the market. This is a result of the concerns regarding sustainability and production costs of the former, as well as issues related to safety and toxicity. Electrode materials for the new sodium-ion batteries may contain available and sustainable elements such as sodium itself, as well as iron or manganese, while eliminating the common cobalt cathode compounds and copper anode current collectors for lithium-ion batteries. The multiple oxidation states, abundance, and availability of manganese favor its use, as it was shown early on for primary batteries. Regarding structural considerations, an extraordinarily successful group of cathode materials are layered oxides of sodium, and transition metals, with manganese being the major component. However, other technologies point towards Prussian blue analogs, NASICON-related phosphates, and fluorophosphates. The role of manganese in these structural families and other oxide or halide compounds has until now not been fully explored. In this direction, the present review paper deals with the different Mn-containing solids with a non-layered structure already evaluated. The study aims to systematize the current knowledge on this topic and highlight new possibilities for further study, such as the concept of entatic state applied to electrodes.

TI Dual-signal readout aptasensor for electrochemical and colorimetric
   assay using a bifunctional Ni-Fe PBA probe
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB We report a dual-readout, electrochemical (EC) and colorimetric aptasensor for accurate assay of disease biomarkers, based on the Ni-Fe prussian blue analogue (Ni-Fe PBA) as a bifunctional signal probe. Specifically, the redox of plural metal ions in Ni-Fe PBA endows it with excellent redox-activity, providing an obviously welldefined redox current for EC detection. Meanwhile, the peroxidase-like activity of Ni-Fe PBA can catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 and oxidation of chromogenic substrate (TMB), which is beneficial for colorimetric analysis. Based on the excellent redox-activity and peroxidase-like activity of the bifunctional Ni-Fe PBA, we realized dual-readout EC and colorimetric detection of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB). This single probe (Ni-Fe PBA) acting as bifunctional roles depends on two different mechanisms and relatively independent signal transduction, which avoids fussy assembly of diverse probes and decreases the uncontrollable factor in different batches. As a result, an EC-colorimetric dual-readout aptasensor shows two linear responses in the range of 0.0001-5 nM and 0.01-50 nM for PDGF-BB, providing more accurate and reliable results compared with the traditional single-signal readout method. The as-designed dual-readout aptasensor is easy to fabricate, highly accurate and reliable, having promising applications in bioanalysis.

TI Recent advances on Fe- and Mn-based cathode materials for lithium and
   sodium ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH
AB The ever-growing market of electrochemical energy storage impels the advances on cost-effective and environmentally friendly battery chemistries. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the most critical energy storage devices for a variety of applications, while sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to complement LIBs in large-scale applications. In respect to their constituent components, the cathode part is the most significant sector regarding weight fraction and cost. Therefore, the development of cathode materials based on Earth's abundant elements (Fe and Mn) largely determines the prospects of the batteries. Herein, we offer a comprehensive review of the up-to-date advances on Fe-and Mn-based cathode materials for LIBs and SIBs, highlighting some promising candidates, such as Li- and Mn-rich layered oxides, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, LiFe1-xMnxPO4, NaxFeyMn1-yO2, Na-4 MnFe2(PO4)(P2O7), and Prussian blue analogs. Also, challenges and prospects are discussed to direct the possible development of cost-effective and high-performance cathode materials for future rechargeable batteries.

   materials using a mean-field approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Understanding and manipulating the relationship between intentionally introduced disorder and material properties necessitates efficient characterization techniques. For example, single crystal diffuse scattering experiments provide insights into the driving forces behind local order phenomena. In this work, we present a time- and resource-efficient approach based on mean field theory that quantifies effective local interaction energies but, unlike other techniques, does not require computationally expensive supercell models. The method is employed to quantify competing driving forces in functionally disordered crystalline materials such as disordered rock salt cathode materials and Prussian blue analogs that share an underlying face-centered lattice.

TI Bimetallic Fe, Ni-PBA on hollow graphite tube for capacitive
   deionization with exceptional stability
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Faradic materials become more and more attractive for capacitive deionization (CDI) due to their high ion adsorption capacity. However, it is still a great challenge to design a stable and high charge-transfer rate material for high-performance desalination. Herein, we report a bimetallic Fe, Ni-doped Prussian blue analogue (PBA)packed hollow graphite tube (FeNiHCF@HGT) electrode for boosting the CDI performance. The high conductivity of HGT and the tight adhesion of PBA crystals on HGT endow the FeNiHCF@HGT electrode with fast charge-transfer, excellent redox activity and high stability through buffering the crystal deformation of PBAs in the ion-intercalation/deintercalation process. In addition, the bimetallic Fe, Ni-doping in PBA at the high-spin (HS) sites enhances the redox activity of FeIIC6/ FeIIIC6 in FeNiHCF with Ni substitution for partial HS Fe. Under the optimal Ni-doping condition, the obtained Fe1Ni1HCF@HGT delivers a high specific capacity and superior rate performance (364F g-1 at 1 A g-1, 88.2% retention at 20 A g-1), with an ultra-high surface capacitance contribution (92.3% at 20 mV s-1). The CDI results demonstrate its outstanding salt adsorption capacity (60.2 mg g-1 in 100 mM NaCl) and exceptional cycle stability (106.6% retention after 100 cycles). This new strategy with the synergy of conductive tube matrix and Ni substitution at PBA lattice sites fully achieves the high-performance CDI.

TI Illuminating the negative thermal expansion mechanism of YFe(CN)6 via
   electronic structure and unusual phonon modes
SO JOURNAL OF RARE EARTHS
AB Understanding the negative thermal expansion (NTE) mechanism remains an important and challenging thing. In this work, we selected the case of YFe(CN)6 to investigate the structure-mechanism relation on the base of crystal structure, electronic structure and lattice dynamics. We expanded the NTE of YFe(CN)6 to 150 K, and the temperature dependence of volume and lattice constants was determined by temperature-variable synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. A large NTE was found in the system. Our theoretical calculations indicate that the Y-N bond exhibits a strong ionic feature through the calculated electron localization function (ELF), which has a strong influence on the anisotropic vibration of the N atom. The detailed lattice dynamics simulations suggest that the NTE of YFe(CN)6 may be related to the presence of the unusual low-frequency modes of the YN6 triangular prism (tri-prism) units. The optical branches with low frequencies are mainly related to the distortion and twisting modes of the YN6 tri-prism units, which contribute most to the NTE effect in the crystal.& COPY; 2022 Chinese Society of Rare Earths.

TI Layered metal-organic framework based on tetracyanonickelate as a
   cathode material for in situ Li-ion storage
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) formed with hexacyanide linkers have been studied for decades. The framework crystal structure of PBAs mainly benefits from the six-fold coordinated cyano functional groups. In this study, in-plane tetracyanonickelate was utilized to engineer an organic linker and design a family of four-fold coordinated PBAs (FF-PBAs; Fe2+Ni(CN)(4), MnNi(CN)(4), Fe3+Ni(CN)(4), CuNi(CN)(4), CoNi(CN)(4), ZnNi(CN)(4), and NiNi(CN)(4)), which showed an interesting two-dimensional (2D) crystal structure. It was found that these FF-PBAs could be utilized as cathode materials of Li-ion batteries, and the Ni/Fe2+ system exhibited superior electrochemical properties compared to the others with a capacity of 137.9 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). Furthermore, after a 5000-cycle long-term repeated charge/discharge measurement, the Ni/Fe2+ system displayed a capacity of 60.3 mA h g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency of 98.8% at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1). In addition, the capacity of 86.1% was preserved at 1000 mA g(-1) as compared with that at 100 mA g(-1), implying a good rate capability. These potential capacities can be ascribed to an in situ reduction of Li+ in the interlayer of Ni/Fe2+ instead of the formation of other compounds with the host material according to ex situ XRD characterization. These specially designed FF-PBAs are expected to inspire new concepts in electrochemistry and other applications requiring 2D materials.

   Combustion of Toluene
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Three 1D hollow tubelike catalysts with different morphologies were prepared via the technology of electron-spinning and pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Based on the different growth position of MOFs, three samples were named as In-PBA/PAN, Out-PBA/PAN, and Mixed-PBA/PAN. After a process of calcination, the well-dispersed In-CoMnOx/MnOy, the cube-stacked Out-CoMnOx/MnOy, and the particle-agglomerated Mixed-CoMnOx/MnOy catalysts were obtained, respectively. For the catalytic combustion of toluene, In- CoMnOx/MnOy, catalyst showed the best catalytic performance (T-90 = 200 degrees C). It had no significant loss of performance within a 40 h thermal stability run. Simultaneously, it also had a relatively good cycling stability and moisture resistance. The catalytic combustion activity was analyzed through a series of characterizations. It was found that the 1D bead chainlike In-CoMnOx/MnOy catalyst could lead to a stronger bimetal synergy effect, more oxygen vacancies, and more weak acid sites compared with the other two samples.

TI Hydrated Electrocatalysis: To Boost the Selectivity for the Oxygen
   Evolution Reaction in Seawater Electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The increase in the production of renewable electricity offers the opportunity to transition from the usage of fossil-based hydrogen to green hydrogen. While mass production of green hydrogen by water electrolysis demands substantial freshwater resources, the abundant availability of seawater provides a promising opportunity to directly use it as an electrolyte in a water electrolyzer. However, a major challenge in seawater electrolysis is the low selectivity for oxygen evolution compared to the chlorine evolution at the anode. To address this, we proposed a strategy to boost the selectivity for oxygen evolution by hydrated electrocatalysis, in which water is itself part of the catalyst. Water molecules that are coordinately bonded to the active catalytic sites play a significant role in enhancing oxygen evolution selectivity. This approach was demonstrated with Prussian blue analogue electrocatalysts in acidified simulated seawater electrolyte using rotating ring disk electrode voltammetry. Microkinetic modeling was employed to correlate the coverage by the reactants (H2O and Cl-) with selectivity. Notably, the crystal water coverage on hydrated electrocatalysts emerged as the partial descriptor for the selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction. To gain insights for coverage by crystal water and Cl-, the thermogravimetric analysis combined with Rietveld refinement and microkinetic Tafel analysis was performed. In a nutshell, we explored the question: if the reactant molecule (H2O) is an integral part of the catalyst, can it promote the corresponding electrochemical oxidation reaction (O2 evolution) over its competitor (Cl2 evolution)?

TI Enhancing Cobalt-Oxygen Bond to Stabilize Defective Co2MnO4 in Acidic
   Oxygen Evolution
SO ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA
AB Co -based oxides have shown promise as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as evidenced by experimental and theoretical studies. However, these common Co -based catalysts suffer from poor stability in acidic environments, making them susceptible to corrosion in acid electrolytes. Consequently, developing OER catalysts that can maintain both activity and stability under strongly acidic conditions is a challenging task for large-scale industrial hydrogen production applications. To address this challenge, the incorporation of manganese (Mn) into the spinel lattice of Co3O4 (CoMn1O) has been proposed, resulting in a defectrich catalyst with improved lifetime in acidic electrolytes. The crystalline phase structures and chemical valence states were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high -resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental maps. The introduction of Mn led to the generation of a significant number of defects due to changes in the local crystal structure. Additionally, as the amount of Mn atoms increased, a red shift was observed in the Co 2p spectrum, indicating an increase in the overall valence of Co and the formation of more stable Co -O bonds. Moreover, when the Mn-to-Co ratio reached 1 (CoMn1O), the resulting catalyst exhibited promising OER activity, with overpotentials of 415 and 552 mV at 10 and 50 mA<middle dot>cm-2, respectively. Detailed physical characterization and electrochemical tests demonstrated that CoMn1O exhibited over four times the stability of Mn-free Co3O4 (CoMn0O). This enhanced stability can be attributed to the introduction of Mn, which promotes electron density bias of Co towards O, resulting in the formation of more stable Co -O bonds. Mn also facilitates acidic oxygen evolution by delaying the oxidation rate of the Co active sites, thereby enhancing stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further employed to analyze the electronic structures of CoMn1O and CoMn0O. The d -band center of Co 3d (epsilon d) in CoMn1O shifted closer to the Fermi level (EF) compared to that of CoMn0O, indicating a reduced reaction energy barrier for CoMn1O and enhanced bonding interaction with OER intermediates. Overall, this work presents a promising strategy for achieving highly efficient and stable acidic oxygen evolution using noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.

TI Bionic octopus tentacle structure-inspired engineering of HPP@PBA
   nanotubes: Towards mechanically reinforced epoxy nanocomposites with
   outstanding flame retardancy and smoke suppression
SO EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL
AB Developing high-performance epoxy (EP) nanocomposites that balance flame retardancy and mechanical properties has been a significant challenge. In this work, a novel hierarchical hybrid flame retardant HPP@PBA with a bionic octopus tentacle structure was successfully constructed. The organic coating composed of phytic acid (PA) and polyaniline (PANI), and CoFe-Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles (CoFe-PBA), effectively enhances the interfacial interaction between halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) and the EP matrix, promoting the formation of a mechanical interlocking structure. By introducing 5 wt% HPP@PBA, the tensile strength and impact strength of the composites increase by 62.4 % and 38.7 %, respectively. EP/HPP@PBA also exhibits excellent flame retardancy and smoke suppression properties. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) of the EP composites reached 33.0 %, achieving the UL-94 V0 rating. Cone calorimetry test (CCT) shows that, compared with pure EP, the peak of heat release rate (pHRR), total heat release (THR), peak of smoke production rate (pSPR), total smoke production (TSP), and peak of carbon monoxide production (COP) of EP/HPP@PBA are reduced by 40.7 %, 34.0 %, 47.2 %, 42.5 %, and 36.6 %, respectively. Additionally, the flame retardant and mechanical enhancement mechanisms of hybrids in EP composites are systematically investigated. This work provides a feasible approach for preparing multifunctional high-performance EP nanocomposites.

TI Identification of catalytic activity descriptors for selective
   5-hydroxymethyl furfural electrooxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Several transition metal oxides and hydroxides have been reported as active electrocatalysts towards the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), an important biomass-derived compound for downstream sustainable chemical and transport fuel production. However, few studies have investigated the activity descriptors influencing the reactivity and selectivity of these materials towards HMF electrooxidation (HMFOR). Herein, Co, Ni and Cu-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA) electrocatalysts were systematically investigated to identify the intrinsic electronic contributions of these redox species towards HMF electrooxidation activity. Cu-phase PBAs exhibited the highest faradaic efficiency of 97.4%, followed by Co-phase (90.5%) and Ni-phase (82.6%) PBAs towards generating 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) at 1.42 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M KOH. This activity trend is found to be influenced by the amount of nucleophilic OH* species expressed on the electrocatalyst's surface. A higher expression of these surface species results in a lower activation energy barrier for the rate limiting step, leading to increased selectivity towards FDCA. Analysis of the bulk electronic properties shows that a strong M-O bond covalency and high d-orbital occupancy contribute to this high expression of electrophilic sites. These findings establish a basis for rationalising the origins of FDCA selectivity in HMFOR catalysts, which importantly eschews using catalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as a prerequisite for high HMFOR performance.

TI Interpretation on a Nonclassical Crystallization Route of Prussian White
   Nanocrystal Preparation
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB In this work, we focused on the interpretation on a nonclassical crystallization route of NaxMn[Fe(CN)(6)](y)center dot nH(2)O (0 < x < 2, 0 < y < 1, MnHCF) nanocrystal preparation via a bottom-up approach. Combining explosive homogeneous nucleation in the microreactor and subsequent crystal growth in the microtube, we carefully studied the dynamic behaviors of MnHCF crystallization under a high time resolution and found that in the early growth stage, it went through a rapid transition of morphology and crystal structure with the enrichment of the sodium content and the decrease of Fe(CN)(6) defect and lattice water. Meanwhile, reducing the primary particle size, increasing the particle concentration, or adjusting the sodium ion concentration could accelerate the transition process, and the sodium ion also played an important role in the anisotropic aggregation-mediated growth. Based on these cognitions, we proposed the growth mechanism of the nonclassical crystallization process from the interplay of free-energy landscapes and particle reaction dynamics. In addition, the crystal architecture laws of MnHCF via a bottom-up approach were summarized to afford rapid and flexible regulation on morphologies and crystal composites.

TI Trade-Off of Metal Sites in Fe-Ni Bimetal Metal-Organic Frameworks for
   Efficient CO2 Photoreduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB This work disclosed the trade-off effect of two metal sites, which display distinct, key functionalities in naturally occurring and artificial catalysts for developing an advanced CO2 reduction system. To exploit the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as advanced catalysts, we prepared a series of Prussian blue analogues (FeNix PBAs) of tunable Ni/Fe molar ratio without changing the oxidation state of Fe and Ni for use as a photocatalyst in the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR). The FeNi0.66 PBA gives a superior CO yield rate (14.28 mmol center dot g-1 center dot h-1) with nearly 100% CO selectivity, but the PBA would be basically CRR-inactive without either Ni or Fe. Experimental and calculation studies demonstrate that Fe and Ni display distinct functionalities. Specifically, Fe is an efficient mediator that boosts the electron transfer both from the photosensitizer to FeNix PBA and from FeNix PBA to CO2, and Ni serves as the active site for CO2 adsorption and reduction. Intriguingly, when there is already sufficient Ni in the catalyst, further increase of the Ni content gives marginal gains in the CO2 adsorption affinity that cannot offset the weakened electron transfer due to the Ni excess. The findings can help advance the design of bimetallic MOF catalysts that mimic naturally occurring bimetallic catalysts.

TI In Situ Growth of Sodium Manganese Hexacyanoferrate on Carbon Nanotubes
   for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO MOLECULES
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnHCF) has emerged as a research hotspot among Prussian blue analogs for sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to its advantages of high voltage, high specific capacity, and abundant raw materials. However, its practical application is limited by its poor electronic conductivity. In this study, we aim to solve this problem through the in situ growth of NaMnHCF on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a simple coprecipitation method. The results show that the overall electronic conductivity of NaMnHCF is significantly improved after the introduction of CNTs. The NaMnHCF@10%CNT sample presents a specific capacity of 90 mA h g-1, even at a current density of 20 C (2400 mA g-1). The study shows that the optimized composite exhibits a superior electrochemical performance at different mass loadings (from low to high), which is attributed to the enhanced electron transport and shortened electron pathway. Surprisingly, the cycling performance of the composites was also improved, resulting from decreased polarization and the subsequent reduction in the side reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, we revealed the evolution of potential plateau roots from the extraction of crystal water during the charge-discharge process of NaMnHCF based on the experimental results. This study is instructive not only for the practical application of NaMnHCF materials but also for advancing our scientific understanding of the behavior of crystal water during the charge-discharge process.

TI NiS2/FeS2 binary nanoparticles confined in interconnected carbon
   framework with regulated pore structure enabled by citric acid for
   enhanced sodium storage properties
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Recently, pyrite iron disulfide (FeS2) has emerged as a promising anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity, affordability, non-toxicity and abundant resource in nature. However, the utilization of FeS2 still confronts the challenges of inferior rate capability and cycling instability for sodium storage, stemming from its low electronic conductivity and substantial volume changes during cycling. Herein, to address these obstacles, NiS2/FeS2 binary nanoparticles encapsulated within a network of interconnected Ndoped porous carbon framework (NiS2/FeS2@NPC) are prepared by a successive solid-state ball milling, carbonization and sulfurization strategy with coordination complex of nickel iron Prussian blue analogue (NiFePBA) as precursor. The introduction of citric acid plays a critical role for the formation of interconnected carbon framework with regulated internal porous structure, thereby achieving heterostructured NiS2/FeS2@NPC with modulated specific surface area and pore volume. The rational design of interconnected N-doped porous carbon framework and heterogeneous structure guarantees rapid ion/electron transport kinetics, alleviated mechanical stress, and enhanced structural integrity. Benefitting from these advantages, the optimal NiS2/FeS2@NPC-1 electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity (545 mAh/g at 1 A/g), superior rate capability (267 mAh/g at 5 A/ g) and ultrastable long-term cycling performance (98.5 % retention over 1000 cycles at 5 A/g). This study presents a novel and efficient design approach for creating durable and high-rate anode materials based on metal sulfides for SIBs.

TI Nickel hexacyanocobaltate quantum dots embedded in N-doped carbon for
   aqueous alkaline batteries with ultrahigh durability
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Nickel-cobalt Prussian blue analogues (Ni-Co PBAs) suffer from structural instability in neural and alkaline electrolytes due to the dissolution of metal cations and cyanide anions caused by external H2O attack, resulting in capacity degradation and restricted life span. Herein, in this work, Ni-Co PBA quantum dots embedded in N-doped carbon (CC-Ni-Co PBA) were synthesized via a facile coprecipitation method and in situ polymerization followed by calcination under a nitrogen atmosphere. The obtained electrode provided a high specific capacity of 333.7 C g(-1) and still retained 188.8 C g(-1) when the current density increased by 40 times. Remarkably, it exhibited outstanding cycling stability with 82% retention of capacity after 10 000 cycles in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte, which benefited from the inner Ni-Co PBA quantum dots that provided a surrounding space and significantly accommodated the volume change during the repeated charge-discharge process, and the outer carbon layer that served as a protective barrier to hinder the Ni-Co PBA from dissolving into the electrolyte, thus realizing the durability of the electrode. Furthermore, an asymmetric alkaline battery device was assembled which achieved a maximum energy density of 33.2 W h kg(-1) and a power density of 3.1 kW kg(-1). Our work contributed to the development of PBA-based electrode materials with improved cycling stability as battery-type electrodes in aqueous electrolytes.

TI Continuous thermally regenerative electrochemical systems for directly
   converting low-grade heat to electricity
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) system, which converts heat to electricity by charging at a lower voltage and discharging at a higher voltage, is a promising technology with high energy conversion efficiency for low-grade heat recovery. However, its charging process consumes additional energy and breaks the continuity of power generation. Herein, we present a continuously operated TREC system for direct heat-toelectricity conversion. In this system, two identical electrochemical cells operating at different temperatures are combined in a unit; thus, electricity can be generated continuously by periodically alternating between two temperatures. This concept is mainly demonstrated with a copper hexacyanoferrate cathode and a Cu/Cu2+ anode, with this system achieving an energy conversion efficiency of 1.76% (14.19% of Carnot efficiency) when operated between 10 and 50 degrees C without heat recuperation effects. Even at an ultralow temperature difference of 10 degrees C vs room temperature, its efficiency is 0.98%. The proposed system allows great freedom in electrode material selection as proven by another system with nickel hexacyanoferrate cathode and Ag/AgCl anode, thereby improving the flexibility and practicability of TREC systems in low-grade heat harvesting.

TI Thin-carbon-layer-enveloped cobalt-iron oxide nanocages as a
   high-efficiency sulfur container for Li-S batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems due to their advantages of its high specific capacity and low material cost. Regrettably, the electrical insulation nature of sulfur, the volume expansion during lithiation, and the internal shuttle effect aroused by the polysulfides dissolution are the central issues for sulfur cathodes. Here, CoFe2O4@C nanocages derived from Prussian blue analogues and polydopamine were utilized as a sulfur host to address these problems. The polar Co-Fe oxide afforded chemical adsorption sites for anchoring polysulfides to reduce the shuttling effect. The hollow core structure of the nanocages could withstand the large volume change during lithiation and delithiation processes. The conductive carbon layer on the nanocages could ameliorate the extremely low electrical conductivity of S and Li2S. The S/CoFe2O4@C cathode demonstrated high capacity and excellent cyclability (821 mA h g(-1)after 100 cycles at 0.5C). More importantly, the combinational strategies of good conductivity, physical space encapsulation, and chemical adsorption provide a means of resolving the current cathode issues in Li-S batteries.

TI Achieving High-Voltage and High-Capacity Aqueous Rechargeable Zinc Ion
   Battery by Incorporating Two-Species Redox Reaction
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Herein, a two-species redox reaction of Co(II)/Co(III) and Fe(II)/Fe(III) incorporated in cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoFe(CN)6) is proposed as a breakthrough to achieve jointly high-capacity and high-voltage aqueous Zn-ion battery. The Zn/CoFe(CN)6 battery provides a highly operational voltage plateau of 1.75 V (vs metallic Zn) and a high capacity of 173.4 mAh g(-1) at current density of 0.3 A g(-1), taking advantage of the two-species redox reaction of Co(II)/Co(III) and Fe(II)/Fe(III) couples. Even under extremely fast charge/discharge rate of 6 A g(-1), the battery delivers a sufficiently high discharge capacity of 109.5 mAh g(-1) with its 3D opened structure framework. This is the highest capacity delivered among all the batteries using Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) cathode up to now. Furthermore, Zn/CoFe(CN)6 battery achieves an excellent cycling performance of 2200 cycles without any capacity decay at coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. One further step, a sol-gel transition strategy for hydrogel electrolyte is developed to construct high-performance flexible cable-type battery. With the strategy, the active materials can adequately contact with electrolyte, resulting in improved electrochemical performance (approximate to 18.73% capacity increase) and mechanical robustness of the solid-state device. It is believed that this study optimizes electrodes by incorporating multi redox reaction species for high-voltage and high-capacity batteries.

TI In vitro galactose-targeted study of RSPP050-loaded micelles
   against liver hepatocellular carcinoma
SO PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Andrographolide is a group of diterpenoid lactone isolated from Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F.) NEES. One of the analogues is 19-O-triphenylmethylandrographolide (RSPP050) which possesses anticancer activity. In seeking to capitalise on the last property, we have investigated the in vitro tumour targeting capabilities and MRI imaging for hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we have designed galactose-targeted and non-targeted micelles comprised of poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactide) that enveloped RSPP050 as an anticancer agent and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) as a contrast agent. The targeting abilities were endeavored by examining the cellular uptake with MTT assay, fluorescence microscopy, Prussian blue staining, and in vitro MRI. Targeted SPIO micelles as a T2* contrast agent decreased the relative T2* MRI intensity at 3 h. Results revealed that galactose micelles displayed 10.91 +/- 0.19% drug loading content, -37.17 +/- 0.63 mV zeta potential, and these micelles at the concentration of 0.5 mu g/ml exhibited higher cytotoxicity than non-targeted micelles and free RSPP050 after incubation for 24 h. Fluorescence microscopy and Prussian blue staining at 3 h demonstrated significant cellular uptake by HepG2 cells. Thus, anticancer activity of RSPP050 could be improved using galactose as a targeting ligand and theranostic function was achieved using SPIO.

TI Three-Dimensional Hierarchical Porous Nanotubes Derived from
   Metal-Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Overall Water Splitting
SO ISCIENCE
AB Effective design of bifunctional catalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important but remains challenging. Herein, we report a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure composed of homogeneously distributed Ni-Fe-P nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbons on nickel foams (denoted as Ni-Fe-P@NC/NF) as an excellent bifunctional catalyst. This catalyst was fabricated by an anion exchange method and a low-temperature phosphidation of nanotubular Prussian blue analogue (PBA). The Ni-Fe-P@NC/NF displayed exceptional catalytic activity toward both HER and OER and delivered an ultralow cell voltage of 1.47 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) with extremely excellent durability for 100 h when assembled as a practical electrolyser. The extraordinary performance of Ni-Fe-P@NC/NF is attributed to the abundance of unsaturated active sites, the well-defined hierarchical porous structure, and the synergistic effect between multiple components. Our work will inspire more rational designs of highly active non-noble electrocatalysts for industrial energy applications.

TI Synthesis, Structure, and Actual Applications of Double Metal Cyanide
   Catalysts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Double metal cyanide (DMC) complexes represent a unique family of materials with an open framework structure. The main current application of these complexes in chemical industry is their use as catalysts (DMCCs) of the ring-opening polymerization of propylene oxide (PO), yielding branched polyols, highly demanded in production of polyurethanes and surfactants. The actual problem of chemical fixing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere gave new impetus to the development of DMCCs, which turned out to be effective in oxirane/CO2 copolymerization. In recent years, new types and formulations of DMCCs were created, so that greater understanding of the reaction mechanisms was achieved and new fields of catalytic applications were found. In the present review, we summarized background and actual information about the synthesis, structure, and mechanisms of the action of DMCCs, as well as their application in the development of new materials and fine chemicals.

TI Elucidation of Active Sites on S, N Codoped Carbon Cubes Embedding Co-Fe
   Carbides toward Reversible Oxygen Conversion in High-Performance
   Zinc-Air Batteries
SO SMALL
AB The development of high-performance but low-cost catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of central importance for realizing the prevailing application of metal-air batteries. Herein a facile route is devised to synthesize S, N codoped carbon cubes embedding Co-Fe carbides by pyrolyzing the Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues (PBA) coated with methionine. Via the strong metal-sulfur interaction, the methionine coating provides a robust sheath to restrain the cubic morphology of PBA upon pyrolysis, which is proved highly beneficial for promoting the specific surface area and active sites exposure, leading to remarkable bifunctionality of ORR and OER comparable to the benchmarks of Pt/C and RuO2. Further elaborative investigations on the activity origin and postelectrolytic composition unravel that for ORR the high activity is mainly contributed by the S, N codoped carbon shell with the inactive carbide phase converting into carbonate hydroxides. For OER, the embedded Co-Fe carbides transform in situ into layered (hydr)oxides, serving as the actual active sites for promoting water oxidation. Zn-air batteries employing the developed hollow structure as the air cathode catalyst demonstrate superb rechargeability, energy efficiency, as well as portability.

TI Porous NiFe-Oxide Nanocubes as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for
   Efficient Water-Splitting
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Electrocatalytic water-splitting, a combination of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER), is highly attractive in clean energy technologies, especially for high-purity hydrogen production, whereas developing stable, earth-abundant, bifunctional catalysts has continued to pose major challenges. Herein, a mesoporous NiFe-oxide nanocube (NiFe-NC) system is developed from a NiFe Prussian blue analog metal-organic framework as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall water-splitting. The NiFe-NCs with similar to 200 nm side length have a Ni/Fe molar ratio of 3:2 and is a composite of NiO and alpha/gamma-Fe2O3. The NCs demonstrate overpotentials of 271 and 197 mV for OER and HER, respectively, in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2), which outperform those of 339 and 347 mV for the spherical NiFe-oxide nanoparticles having a similar composition. The electrolyzer constructed using NiFe-NCs requires an impressive cell voltage of 1.67 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Along with a mesoporous structure with a broad pore size distribution, the NiFe-NCs demonstrate the qualities of a desired corrosion-resistant water-splitting catalyst with long-term stability. The exposure of active sites at the edges and vertices of the NCs was validated to play a crucial role in their overall catalytic performance.

AB In this work, manganese ferrite nanocubes were synthesized by thermal calcination of Prussian blue analogues. The obtained products inherited the high porous structure of the metal-organic frameworks and were employed to construct an efficient non-enzymatic hydrogen peroxide sensor. The electrochemical sensor showed fast and reliable response towards the hydrogen peroxide with the sensitivity of 53.7 mu A/mM cm(2). The linear range was from 1 mu M to 24 mM and the detection limit was 0.3 mu M. The results revealed the high electrocatalytic activity of the manganese ferrite nanocubes owing to the metal-organic framework structure. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The composite electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (801 F g(-1)), rate stability (68.5 %), and cycle stability.

TI One-dimensional core-shell CoC@CoFe/C@PPy composites for high-efficiency
   microwave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB In recent years, electromagnetic pollution has become more and more serious, and there is an urgent need for microwave absorbing materials with superior performance. Prussian blue analogue (PBA) is a metal organic framework material with the advantages of diverse morphology and tunable composition. Therefore, PBA has attracted a lot of attention in the field of microwave absorption. In this work, PBA was coated on the surface of carbon composites by hydrothermal method, and then PPy was compounded on its surface after carbonization treatment to construct hierarchical core-shell CoC@CoFe/C@PPy fibers. The fibers have Co-doped C composites as the core and CoFe/C decorated with PPy as the shell. This unique hierarchical structure and various microwave absorption mechanisms are described in detail. The microwave absorption performance is optimized by adjusting the filling of the sample. The best microwave absorption performances are achieved at 25 wt% filling of CoC@CoFe/C@PPy. At a thickness of just 1.69 mm, CoC@CoFe/C@PPy fiebrs have a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of -64.32 dB. When the thickness is 1.88 mm, CoC@CoFe/C@PPy achieves a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EABmax) of 5.38 GHz. The results indicate that the CoC@CoFe/C@PPy composite fibers have a great potential in the field of microwave absorption.

TI Advances in aqueous zinc-ion battery systems: Cathode materials and
   chemistry
SO PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Renewable energy has been extensively developed to curb the greenhouse effect and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Nevertheless, their applications are greatly limited due to the intermittence and instability nature. Therefore, reasonably store and distribution of new energy have become a widespread concern. Among various energy storage technologies, lithium-ion battery technology has achieved great success, but the scarcity of lithium resources and the use of toxic and flammable organic electrolytes have limited its further development. Oppositely, aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) have advantages of safety, abundant resources, low cost, and the potential to store energy at the power plant level. However, the low capacity, poor cycle stability, and low voltage of cathode materials have become one of the limiting factors for the application of AZIBs. Herein, we systematically summarize and discuss the reported cathode materials, including manganese-based oxides, vanadium-based compounds, Prussian blue analogues, organics, MXenes, transition metal chalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, and others. Their developments, challenges, and feasible modification strategies are thoroughly analyzed. In addition, we also summarize and compare the proposed energy storage mechanisms of cathode materials. Finally, we propose potential research directions in the future for cathode materials, and provide essential guidance for the development of high-performance AZIBs.

   lithium storage
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB In this study, porous CoFe2O4/carbon composite nanofibers with metal-organic framework (MOF) structures were prepared by electrospinning and in situ growth followed by annealing. CoFe2O4 particles derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) were firmly anchored onto highly conductive carbon nanofibers by tuning the growth time, generating the sturdy construction and prominent conductivity of CFO@C-24 with a large specific surface area, stable fibrous morphology and MOF structure integrity. Owing to these structural merits, more active sites are provided with accelerated electron/Li-ion transport when the nanofiber is applied as an anode in lithium-ion batteries. A high initial discharge/charge capacity of 1400/1328 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), a considerable reversible discharge/charge capacity of 623/598 mA h g(-1)after 400 cycles at 1 A g(-1) and an excellent rate performance of 585 mA h g(-1) at 1.5 A g(-1) are presented. Specific capacities of 1166, 1059, 861, 742 and 585 mA h g(-1) of CFO@C-24 are achieved at multiple current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 1.5 A g(-1), respectively, and the discharge specific capacity is able to resume to 1035 mA h g(-1) when returned to 0.1 A g(-1). Upon assembling into full cells, considerable capacitance and rate performance are delivered and a series of LED bulbs can be lit to demonstrate its potential in real applications.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB Potassium-ion battery (KIB) represents an emerging battery technology. Here in this review, we highlight the research progress of cathode materials for KIBs in recent 2 years. Statuses of four typical cathodes, layered metal oxides, polyanion compounds, Prussian blue analogs, and organic cathodes are discussed. Electrochemical performances of the cathode materials are improved through tailoring of the composition, microstructure, and surface modification of the electrodes. Regulating electrode-electrolyte interface also brings about prominent improvement in the rate capability and cycling stability of the cathodes. In particular, we speculate that both layered metal oxides and polyanion compounds should be of great application potential as cathodes for the future KIB full cells.

TI Sea urchin-like Ni-Fe sulfide architectures as efficient
   electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Exploring highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is becoming increasingly important in the field of sustainable energy systems. In this work, a three dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous nickel and iron based sulfide (Ni-Fe-S) with a sea urchin-like morphology is synthesized by a facile sulfurization of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursors with a hydrothermal reaction and post-calcination treatment. The mass ratio of PBA and sulfur sources, the hydrothermal temperature and time, and the presence of hydrazine hydrate are found to be important factors for the formation of the unique sea urchin-like materials with the porous carbon layer and mixed phases of Fe5Ni4S8 and NiS, which are conducive to fast mass and charge transfer along various directions, endow the materials with mixed valences, improve the electronic conductivity and prevent the agglomeration of nanostructured sulfides. Benefiting from these fascinating advantages, the optimal Ni-Fe-S catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities with an overpotential as low as 200 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good stability toward the OER. This work not only offers a facile strategy to prepare efficient transition metal based sulfides with excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER but also extends the synthesis and application of PBA-derived nanostructured materials.

   systems
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been powering portable electronic devices and electric vehicles for over three decades. However, growing concerns regarding the limited availability of lithium resources and the subsequent surge in costs have prompted the exploration of alternative energy storage systems beyond LIBs. Among these alternatives, sodium-based batteries, with their similar intercalation chemistry, have emerged as the most promising alternative due to their cost-effectiveness and the abundance of sodium reserves in nature. Developing sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) that possess high energy density, long lifespan, and high-rate capability necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms, especially the intricate chemistry involved in cathode materials. In this review, we delve into the reaction mechanisms of the most commonly used cathode materials for SIBs, which include layered transition-metal oxides, polyanionic compounds, Prussian blue analogues, etc. We also highlight the specific physicochemical properties that have been uncovered through the application of advanced operando characterization techniques. Building upon the insights gained from this comprehensive review, we put forth future perspectives on the development of novel cathode materials for SIBs.

TI Strategies to increase the stability and energy density of NVPF
SO FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Although the lithium-ion battery has dominated the sustainable energy field for many years, environmentally friendly and inexpensive sodium (Na) is a great contender to reduce the use of limited lithium resources. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have a big catalog of cathode materials grouped into four main types: the Prussian blue analogs, organic-based materials, layered metal oxides, and polyanions, whereas the latter is characterized by sodium superionic conductors (NASICON) with its chemical formula such as Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3 (NVPF) gaining prevalence. Therefore, this review focuses on the most recent studies to promote the long-term stability, capacity, and energy density of NASICON's high-potential NVPF.

TI Defect-free-induced Na<SUP>+</SUP> disordering in electrode materials
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB For reaching high-performance of electrode materials, it is generally believed that understanding the structure evolution and heterogeneous alignment effect is the key. Presently, a very simple and universally applicable self-healing method is investigated to prepare defect-free Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) that reach their theoretical capacity as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). For direct imaging of the local structure and the dynamic process at the atomic scale, we deliver a fast ion-conductive nickel-based PBA that enables rapid Na+ extraction/insertion within 3 minutes and a capacity retention of nearly 100% over 4000 cycles. This guest-ion disordered and quasi-zero-strain nonequilibrium solid-solution reaction mechanism provides an effective guarantee for realizing long-cycle life and high-rate capability electrode materials that operate via reversible two-phase transition reaction. Unconventional materials and mechanisms that enable reversible insertion/extraction of ions in low-cost metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) within minutes have implications for fast-charging devices, grid-scale energy storage applications, material discovery, and tailored modification.

TI A review on hexacyanoferrate-based materials for energy storage and
   smart windows: challenges and perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Well-known since the 18th century and widely used in painting and later in photography, hexacyanoferrate, or "Prussian blue", is currently getting its "second life" as a promising material in several of the most advanced fields of the present technological sectors. This is mostly due to the rapid development of the energy storage market, which requires advanced, reliable, but also cost-effective materials for large-scale applications in load-levelling of renewable energy power sources. Non-Li technologies are considered as one of the most fertile R&D directions in this field, and Prussian blue demonstrates extremely promising characteristics for this kind of application. The unique features of this material are due to peculiarities of its atomic structure and ionic and electronic properties. In this article we review and discuss current research efforts in this field employing different hexacyanoferrate-based compounds as potential electrochemical storage and electrochromic devices. After a brief review of its history, we analyze the peculiarities of the atomic structure of these types of systems. We further summarize and analyze the most important and interesting experimental electrochemical data in this field, linking the particular atomic structure of the studied compounds with their observed electrochemical behaviour. This provides us with a snapshot of the current experimental state in this field and allows us to make certain predictions for its future development.

TI Growth of Metal Organic Frameworks on the Surface of Individual
   Cellulose Nanocrystals
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB Composites of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are appealing for constructing new materials with applications in catalysts, photonics, gas separation, and environmental remediation. In this paper, the growth of various MOFs on individual CNCs was investigated by varying the growth conditions to obtain a hybrid material, MOF@CNCs. While ZIF-8 and UiO-66 uniformly grew on the surface of CNCs, other common MOFs (e.g., MIL-96, MOF-808, HKUST-1, and MOF-5) exhibited irregular growth patterns. The morphology of the MOF@CNCs materials obtained depended on the metals and ligand used. Furthermore, we investigated the growth of Prussian blue (PB) on CNCs, but we were unable to realize well-defined composites with the framework attached to the surface of CNCs. These investigations are important to realize CNC@MOF composite materials where individual CNCs are functionalized with MOFs.

TI Ultrafast and Ultrastable Heteroarchitectured Porous Nanocube Anode
   Composed of CuS/FeS2 Embedded in Nitrogen-Doped Carbon for
   Use in Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB The enhancement of the structural stability of conversion-based metal sulfides at high current densities remains a major challenge in realizing the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The instability of metal sulfides is caused by the large volume variation and sluggish reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation. To overcome this, herein, a heterostructured nanocube anode composed of CuS/FeS2 embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (CuS/FeS2@NC) is synthesized. Size- and shape-controlled porous carbon nanocubes containing metallic nanoparticles are synthesized by the two-step pyrolysis of a bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor. The simple sulfurization-induced formation of highly conductive CuS along with FeS2 facilitates sodium-ion diffusion and enhances the redox reversibility upon cycling. The mesoporous carbon structure provides excellent electrolyte impregnation, efficient charge transport pathways, and good volume expansion buffering. The CuS/FeS2@NC nanocube anode exhibits excellent sodium storage characteristics including high desodiation capacity (608 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)), remarkable long-term cycle life (99.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 A g(-1)), and good rate capability up to 5 A g(-1). The simple, facile synthetic route combined with the rational design of bimetallic PBA nanostructures can be widely utilized in the development of conversion-based metal sulfides and other high-capacity anode materials for high-performance SIBs.

TI Wireless wearable potentiometric sensor for simultaneous determination
   of pH, sodium and potassium in human sweat
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper reports on the development of a flexible-wearable potentiometric sensor for real-time monitoring of sodium ion (Na+), potassium ion (K+), and pH in human sweat. Na0.44MnO2, polyaniline, and K2Co[Fe(CN)6] were used as sensing materials for Na+, H+ and K+ monitoring, respectively. The simultaneous potentiometric Na+, K+, and pH sensing were carried out by the developed sensor, which enables signal collection and transmission in real-time to the smartphone via a Wi-Fi access point. Then, the potentiometric responses were evaluated by a designed android application. Na+, K+, and pH sensors illustrated high sensitivity (59.7 +/- 0.8 mV/decade for Na+, 57.8 +/- 0.9 mV/decade for K+, and 54.7 +/- 0.6 mV/pH for pH), excellent stability, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility. The results of on-body experiments demonstrated that the proposed platform is capable of real-time monitoring of the investigated ions.

TI Functional phase bistability in a nanocrystalline
   RbMn[Fe(CN)6] thin film fabricated by matrix-assisted laser
   evaporation
SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB One of the main barriers hindering applications of Prussian blue metal assemblies is their poor processability, which makes the fabrication of intact thin films very difficult. In this work, a nanocrystalline RbMn[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot xH(2)O film on silicon substrate was obtained for the first time via laser-stimulated deposition and investigated. Temperature-induced phase transition and bistability within broad hysteresis loop (120 K), along with transition temperatures up to 317 K, which is the highest in the RbMnFe series, were observed using variable-temperature Raman spectroscopy. This study thus proposes a reliable deposition approach for preparing a functional magnetic materials that operate at room temperature. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Uniaxial negative thermal expansion behavior of β-CuSCN
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Negative thermal expansion (NTE) as an interesting physical behavior is promising for thermal expansion control engineering. beta-CuSCN consists of linear chain units with NTE along the c-axis. The NTE mechanism of beta-CuSCN is investigated by variable temperature x-ray diffraction, temperature- and pressure-dependent Raman spectra, and first-principles calculations. It is found that the quasi rigid unit modes associated with the rotations of S-C equivalent to N-Cu chains driven by Cu and S antiphase transverse vibrations and longitudinal acoustic and transverse acoustic modes involving the collective motions of atoms have large negative Gruneisen parameters, contributing significantly to the NTE of c-axis. Translational and librational motions of C equivalent to N units, in which C and N atoms vibrate in the same and opposite directions have much smaller negative Gruneisen parameters, contribute only a minor part to the NTE, which is different from the known NTE mechanism of cyanides and Prussian blue analogous.

TI Electrolyte Design Enables Stable and Energy-Dense Potassium-Ion
   Batteries
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Free from strategically important elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper, potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are heralded as promising low-cost and sustainable electrochemical energy storage systems that complement the existing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the reported electrochemical performance of PIBs is still suboptimal, especially under practically relevant battery manufacturing conditions. The primary challenge stems from the lack of electrolytes capable of concurrently supporting both the low-voltage anode and high-voltage cathode with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. Herein, we report a promising electrolyte that facilitates the commercially mature graphite anode (>3 mAh cm(-2)) to achieve an initial CE of 91.14 % (with an average cycling CE around 99.94 %), fast redox kinetics, and negligible capacity fading for hundreds of cycles. Meanwhile, the electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with the 4.4 V (vs. K+/K) high-voltage K2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] (KMF) cathode. Consequently, the KMF||graphite full-cell without precycling treatment of both electrodes can provide an average discharge voltage of 3.61 V with a specific energy of 316.5 Wh kg(-1)-(KMF+graphite), comparable to the LiFePO4||graphite LIBs, and maintain 71.01 % capacity retention after 2000 cycles.

TI Gel biopolymer electrolyte for high-voltage, durable, and flexible Zn/K

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Zinc-ion rechargeable battery (ZIRB) is a promising candidate for future energy storage systems due to its costeffectiveness, operational safety, and environmental friendliness. However, the commercial-scale application of ZIRB is hindered by its insufficient energy efficiency, poor rate capability, and inferior cycling stability. Here, we introduce a gel biopolymer electrolyte (GBE) empowered Zn/K dual-ion battery with exceptional cycling and rate performance. Calling for sustainability, this cellulose-encapsulated bisalt electrolyte presents strong mechanical robustness that inhibits Zn dendrite growth and promotes anodic plating/stripping reversibility. Sandwiching the GBE between a potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMnHCF) cathode and a Zn anode, the coin-cell configuration of KMnHCF GBE Zn demonstrates a high voltage discharge plateau of 1.80 V, an initial capacity of up to 65 mAh g,-1 and excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 92 % after 1,000 cycles. Furthermore, the superior durability, flexibility, safety, and endurance with extreme conditions (e.g., bending, puncturing, and cutting) demonstrated by KMnHCF GBE Zn pouch-cell enables its future application in wearable electronics.

AB Control of the thermomechanical properties of functional materials is of great fundamental and technological significance, with the achievement of zero or negative thermal expansion behavior being a key goal for various applications. A dynamic, reversible mode of control is demonstrated for the first time in two Prussian blue derivative frameworks whose coefficients of thermal expansion are tuned continuously from negative to positive values by varying the concentration of adsorbed CO2. A simple empirical model that captures site-specific guest contributions to the framework expansion is derived, and displays excellent agreement with the observed lattice behaviour.

TI Integration of CoFe Alloys and Fe/Fe3C Nanoparticles into

SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB The development of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts of air electrodes is very important for the commercial application of metal-air batteries. Herein, this work demonstrates the integration of CoFe alloys and Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles into N-doped carbon nanosheets as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst in Zn-air batteries. Thanks to the independent active sites for oxygen evolution and reduction reaction, the fabricated aqueous Zn-air battery exhibits a desirable operation stability of up to 350 h without significant performance deterioration. The promising power density (154.1 mW.cm(-2)) and specific capacity (803 mA h/g(Zn)) make this hybrid catalyst an ideal substitute for precious metal catalysts. Moreover, the solid-state flexible Zn-air battery has a large power density of 108.4 mW.cm(-2), which is enough to drive 35 diode lights. It is believed that this novel bifunctional catalyst may provide an interesting insight into the design of durable oxygen electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries.

TI Metal-Organic Frameworks with d-f Cyanide Bridges: Structural Diversity,
   Bonding Regime, and Magnetism
SO LANTHANIDE METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS
SE Structure and Bonding
AB We present a selection of metal-organic frameworks based on d-f and f-f linkages, discussing their structural features and properties from experimental and theoretical viewpoints. We give an overview of our own synthetic and modeling methodologies, highlighting the complexity of the interdisciplinary approach developed. Significant experimental and computational strategies of other researchers are also reviewed. The bonding regime of lanthanide units in MOFs is similar to those encountered in mono-or polynuclear f-type coordination compounds. However, the steric demands of constructing a three-dimensional network determine specific ligand composition and topologies at the local f nodes. Due to weak interaction propensity of the inner shell f orbitals, the electronic structure treatments of lanthanide units require certain conceptual and technical subtleties. With proper handling, multiconfiguration wave function approaches as well as density functional theory (DFT) treatments can be analyzed in terms of meaningful ligand field (LF) modeling. The interplay of LF and spin-orbit (SO) effects in determining the magnetic anisotropy is illustrated, after reviewing the experimental magnetic behavior of several d-f cyanide-bridged systems.

TI A High Rate and Stable Hybrid Li/Na-Ion Battery Based on a Hydrated
   Molten Inorganic Salt Electrolyte
SO SMALL
AB Taking into the consideration safety, environmental impact, and economic issue, the construction of aqueous batteries based on aqueous electrolyte has become an indispensable technical option for large-scale electrical energy storage. The narrow electrochemical window is the main problem of conventional aqueous electrolyte. Here, an economical room-temperature inorganic hydrated molten salt (RTMS) electrolyte with a large electrochemical stability window of 3.1 V is proposed. Compared with organic fluorinated molten salts, RTMS is composed of lithium nitrate hydrate and sodium nitrate with much lower cost. Based on the RTMS electrolyte, a hybrid Li/Na-ion full battery is fabricated from cobalt hexacyanoferrate cathode (NaCoHCF) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) anode. The full cell with the RTMS electrolyte exhibits a fantastic performance with high capacity of 139 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, 90 mAh g(-1) at 20 C, and capacity retention of 94.7% over 500 cycles at 3 C. The excellent performances are contributed to the unique properties of RTMS with a large electrochemical window, solvated H2O free and high mobility of Li+, which exhibits excellent Li-ions insertion and extraction capacity of NaCoHCF. This RTMS cell provides a new economic choice for large-scale energy storage.

TI Green synthesized zinc derived nanocomposites with enhanced
   photocatalytic activity: An updated review on structural modification,
   scientific assessment and environmental applications
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recently, zinc-derived nanocomposites (Zn-DN) are gaining much scientific interest due to their intense prop-erties such as variable energy band structures, permit a larger variety of wavelengths, and less recombination capability of charge carriers. The adsorption and photocatalysis behavior of zinc materials could be improved with different non-metals (N, S, C, F, and Cl), metals (transition metals, alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals), polymers, and Prussian blue analogues. This review thoroughly introduced the preparation methods of Zn-DN and analyzes how doping impacts the optical properties, making them active in the visible region. Numerous shapes, including spherical, rod-like, cube-like, triangular, hexagonal, and many others, have been examined. Additionally, the creations of Zn-DN have applications in a wide variety of systems, substrates, and dispersion media for wastewater treatment. The effects of doping on environmental applications with the proposed mechanism are also summarized. Reactive oxygen species are generated on visible light irradiation for photo-catalytic degradation of toxic organic pollutants. Given that the most commonly ZnO and ZnO-derived nano-composites were synthesized in previous research and highlighted. This research aims to provide a basis for the design of semiconducting nanoparticle architectures for next-generation applications in addition to a compre-hensive assessment of existing zinc-derived nanocomposites. The prospected review also includes the difficulties and potential developments in Zn-DN nanocomposites.

TI Improving the cycling stability and rate performance of an aqueous
   sodium-ion supercapattery via mitigating metal dissolution and
   boosting conductivity by anchoring FePBA on rGO
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB To fulfill the research goal of deriving high energy and high specific power in a sustainable, safe, and cost-effective manner, Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA)-based Na+ ion hybrid capacitors have drawn great interest. However, inherent poor conductivity and metal dissolution problems limit their full-scale exploration as a cathode material. This work attempts to address the above two challenges by compositing a Fe-PBA (NaxFe[Fe(CN)6]<middle dot>nH2O) (FPBA) with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The highly conductive nature of rGO boosts the overall conductivity of the FPBA/rGO composite, rendering improved rate performance. At the same time, the surface and edge functional groups (epoxy, hydroxy and carboxylate) on rGO provide firm anchorage to surface Fe ions of FPBA through coordination and thus suppress the metal dissolution, eventually leading to longer cyclability. Due to the synergistic effect of rGO and FPBA, the FPBA/rGO composite also shows significantly enhanced charge storage capacity (437 C g-1 at 1 A g-1) compared to FPBA (204 C g-1 at 1 A g-1). The detailed mechanistic and kinetic studies reveal that, besides faradaic-type charge storage, FPBA/rGO also involves a significant portion of electrical double layer charging due to the presence of rGO. The hybrid charge storage mechanism in FPBA/rGO enables the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor device (FPBA/rGO//FPBA/rGO) to exhibit high specific energy as well as specific power (maxE = 62.32 W h kg-1 @ 0.9 kW kg-1; maxP = 9.0 kW kg-1 @ 31.92 W h kg-1). Moreover, owing to suppressed metal dissolution, the symmetrical device having the FPBA/rGO composite electrodes shows excellent capacitive retention of 91% after 10 000 cycles compared to that with the FPBA-based device (75%).

TI Solid-state synthesis of diminutively granular and highly crystalline
   manganese hexacyanoferrate for a supercapacitor electrode
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB Supercapacitors are considered as promising energy storage devices due to their high power density, fast charging/discharging process and long cycle life. The synthesis of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) by the traditional co-precipitation method faces the problems of wastewater treatment, poor material reusability and low space utilization rate. Herein, an efficient and simple solid-state synthesis protocol is used to prepare diminutively granular and highly crystalline manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF). MnHCF exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with the specific capacitance of 202.8 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in a neutral electrolyte. At the same time, MnHCF has good cycle stability, which could maintain 95.63% after 8000 charge-discharge cycles. The maximum energy density of the two-electrode system with MnHCF as a positive electrode and YP-50F as a negative electrode is 18.89 W h kg-1 at 981.25 W kg-1 and a maximum power density of 7184.73 W kg-1 at 7.52 W h kg-1. The outstanding electrochemical properties can be attributed to smaller particle size and higher crystallinity to achieve faster ion diffusion and greater diffusion depth. Therefore, adopting a solid-state synthesis protocol is a promising approach to achieve low-cost and large-scale production of PBAs.
   A solid-state synthesis protocol enables the fabrication of diminutively granular and highly crystalline manganese hexacyanoferrate in a limited reaction region without additives and solvent.

TI Redox-targeted catalysis for vanadium redox-flow batteries
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Vanadium redox-flow battery (VRB) as a promising electrochemical power source for large-scale energy storage, suffers from various polarization losses despite that it has been extensively studied in the past decades. Among these losses, the sluggish interfacial charge transfer of the vanadium species on the respective electrode renders large overpotentials giving rise to inevitable hydrogen and oxygen evolutions during the charging process. In this study, we report an unprecedented method based on the redox targeting concept to tackle the above issues. Prussian blue (PB) and a Prussian blue analogues (PBA) with identical redox potentials to VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ are grafted on cathode and anode, respectively. Upon operation, the reversible proton-coupled redox targeting reactions between PB and VO2+/VO2+ on cathode, PBA and V2+/V3+ on anode facilitate the interfacial charge transfer of the vanadium species and concomitantly inhibit the hydrogen and oxygen evolutions, which improves the selectivity of the redox reactions and considerably enhances the round-trip energy efficiency and cycling performance of VRB in a wide range of current densities. The above redox-assisted catalytic reactions were scrutinized and the mechanisms are unequivocally manifested with various electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements. We anticipate the surface immobilized redox catalysis approach demonstrated here would generically provide a paradigm for improving the sluggish kinetic processes in a variety of electrochemical devices.

TI Reviving Sodium Tunnel Oxide Cathodes Based on Structural Modulation and
   Sodium Compensation Strategy Toward Practical Sodium-Ion Cylindrical
   Battery
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB As a typical tunnel oxide, Na0.44MnO2 features excellent electrochemical performance and outstanding structural stability, making it a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it suffers from undesirable challenges such as surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity. Herein, an internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is adopted by replacing part of the Mn with Ti to optimize the bulk phase and construct a Ti-containing epitaxial stabilization layer, resulting in reduced surface residual alkali, excellent Na+ transport kinetics and improved water/air stability. Specifically, the Na0.44Mn0.85Ti0.15O2 using water-soluble carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder can realize a capacity retention rate of 94.30% after 1,000 cycles at 2C, and excellent stability is further verified in kilogram large-up applications. In addition, taking advantage of the rich Na content in Prussian blue analog (PBA), PBA-Na0.44Mn1-xTixO2 composites are designed to compensate for the insufficient Na in the tunnel oxide and are matched with hard carbon to achieve the preparation of coin full cell and 18650 cylindrical battery with satisfactory electrochemical performance. This work enables the application of tunnel oxides cathode for SIBs in 18650 cylindrical batteries for the first time and promotes the commercialization of SIBs.
   An internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is proposed to slove the problems of surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity in the tunnel oxide cathode material (Na0.44MnO2). In addition, Prussian blue analog (PBA)-Na0.44Mn1-xTixO2 composites are designed to construct practical sodium-ion cylindrical battery with hard carbon anodes for the first time, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and promotes the commercialization of SIBs. image

TI Activation of Molecular Oxygen and Peroxodisulfate for Removal of
   Water-Soluble Antibiotics Using Metal-Organic Framework-Derived
   CoNx@NC Catalyst
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Advanced oxidation process using reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be efficiently utilized to remove soluble contaminants from water. Herein, we have reported a facile method for the activation of molecular oxygen to produce ROS using Prussian blue analog (PBA)-derived catalyst CoNx@NC. The two-electron reduction of O-2 by CoNx@NC produces H2O2, which is further dissociated into & sdot;OH radicals and decomposes water-soluble organic dye (methylene blue) and antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin). CoNx@NC is capable of removing 98 % of ciprofloxacin in a short period of time (65 minutes) in the presence of oxygen. Further, CoNx@NC can activate peroxodisulfate in the aqueous medium to produce ROS (SO4 & sdot;(-), and & sdot;OH) and catalyzes the decomposition of the antibiotics and organic dye. The efficiency of the degradation of antibiotics and dye is improved when peroxodisulfate is used for the formation ROS. The higher oxidation potential and longer life-time of SO4 & sdot;(-) than & sdot;OH improves the rate oxidation with peroxodisulfate. The Co-N coordination in CoNx@NC stabilizes the system against leaching and shows excellent stability for recycling (for five cycles) during the removal of contaminants.

TI Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate as Zn ion host toward aqueous energy
   storage
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs), a new green energy storage system, have enormous development potential among various aqueous batteries due to the superiorities of good environmental friendliness, low production costs, high operational safety, high theoretical capacity, and excellent rate performance. Compared with traditional cathode materials like manganese oxides and vanadium oxides, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with a firm 3D framework and large ion channels aremore suitable for zinc ions insertion/extraction. Here, environmentally friendly sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnHCF) is applied to aqueous ZIBs, and its excellent electrochemical performance is characterized by varieties of analytical techniques. The charge/discharge profiles display a rather flat operating platform with extremely small redox polarization (less than 0.05 V). Under the current density of 50 mA g(-1), NaMnHCF can attain an initial charged specific capacity of 55.3 mAh g(-1). Meanwhile, it also exhibits a superior electrochemical rate performance. Furthermore, the mechanism of zinc ions insertion/extraction in the NaMnHCF frameworks is revealed through a deep exploration of the relationship between element states, storage kinetics, crystal structure, and electrochemical properties. From a practical standpoint, the environmentally friendly NaMnHCF exhibits favorable rate capability and cycling stability, which makes it be a perfect choice for aqueous ZIBs of the application in the green new energy industry.

SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB We report herein a novel method for the synthesis of nickel-iron hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles involving the participation of tetrahydrofuran and hydrogen peroxide. It has been found that desired ratio of potassium ferricyanide and nickel sulphate is converted into nickel-iron hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles in the presence of tetrahydrofuran and hydrogen peroxide within 30 min at 60 degrees C. The as synthesized nickel-iron hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles have been characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and cyclic voltammetry. The average sizes of nanoparticles are found in the order of 31 nm. The nickel-iron molar ratio significantly influences the electrochemical behaviour of as synthesized nanoparticles modified electrode. Electrochemical sensing of hydrazine has been examined on mixed metal hexacyanoferrate modified electrode with analytical sensitivity in the order of 135.76 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and lowest detection limit of 50 nM. Apart from its use in electrochemical sensing, mix metal nanoparticles are soluble in aqueous media and show excellent peroxidase mimetic activity with the Michaelis-Menten constant and V-max in the order of 1.5 mM and 3.06 x 10(-7) m s(-1) respectively for H2O2 mediated oxidation of o-dianisidine thus representing novel material for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

AB Designing an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that combines high activity with exceptional stability is a pivotal advancement in sustainable water splitting technology, heralding a novel approach to produce clean, high-purity hydrogen. This paper introduces an innovative strategy centered on the construction of a three-dimensional heterostructure supported on carbon cloth, specifically Fe-CoS2/Co(OH)2/CC. This meticulous strategy begins with the meticulous treatment of Co(OH)2 nanosheets, cleverly inducing the formation of Prussian blue-like compounds through in-situ etching techniques. Subsequently, a direct sulfuration treatment is employed, resulting in a delicate reconstruction of the Co(OH)2 nanosheet surface, ultimately yielding a unique Fe-CoS2/Co(OH)2/CC heterostructure. This composite material exhibits remarkable low overpotential performance, achieving an impressive 235 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is comparable to that of established catalysts such as Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2). The exceptional catalytic activity of Fe-CoS2/Co(OH)2/CC is primarily attributed to its unique 3D structure, crafted through the in-situ growth of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). This structure not only ensures uniform iron doping but also significantly enhances the material's stability and reactivity. Furthermore, the high conductivity of the self-supported carbon cloth electrode facilitates rapid electron transport, further augmenting the overall catalytic efficiency.

TI Magnetically Controlled Photothermal, Colorimetric, and Fluorescence
   Trimode Assay for Gastric Cancer Exosomes Based on Acid-Induced
   Decomposition of CP/Mn-PBA DSNBs
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The accurate quantification of cancer-derived exosomes, which are emerging as promising noninvasive biomarkers for liquid biopsies in the early diagnosis of cancer, is becoming increasingly imperative. In our work, we developed a magnetically controlled photothermal, colorimetric, and fluorescence trimode aptasensor for human gastric cancer cell (SGC-7901)-derived exosomes. This sensor relied on CP/Mn-PBA DSNBs nanocomposites, created by decorating copper peroxide (CP) nanodots on polyethyleneimine-modified manganese-containing Prussian blue analogues double-shelled nanoboxes (PEI-Mn-PBA DSNBs). Through self-assembly, we attached CD63 aptamer-labeled CP/Mn-PBA DSNBs (Apt-CP/Mn-PBA DSNBs) to complementary DNA-labeled magnetic beads (cDNA-MB). During exosome incubation, these aptamers preferentially formed complexes with exosomes, and we efficiently removed the released CP/Mn-PBA DSNBs by using magnetic separation. The CP/Mn-PBA DSNBs exhibited high photoreactivity and photothermal conversion efficiency under near-infrared (NIR) light, leading to temperature variations under 808 nm irradiation, correlating with different exosome concentrations. Additionally, colorimetric detection was achieved by monitoring the color change in a 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) system, facilitated by PEI modification, NIR-enhanced peroxidase-like activity of CP/Mn-PBA DSNBs and their capacity to generate Cu2+ and H2O2 under acidic conditions. Moreover, in the presence of Cu2+ and ascorbic acid (AA), DNA sequences could form dsDNA-templated copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), which emitted strong fluorescence at around 575 nm. Increasing exosome concentrations correlated with decreases in temperature, absorbance, and fluorescence intensity. This trimode biosensor demonstrated satisfactory ability in differentiating gastric cancer patients from healthy individuals using human serum samples.

TI Hierarchical FeCo/C@Ni(OH)2 heterostructures for enhanced
   oxygen evolution activity
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Layered Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are considered as one of the most promising oxide evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to its excellent oxidation and reduction reaction performance which has been extensively studied. However, there is a big gap between the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets and noble metal catalysts in terms of the OER activity which is difficult to meet the request of application. Here, a strategy was developed to deposit Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets on FeCo/C nanocubes surface to create a hierarchical heterostructure as a new type of non-noble metal catalyst. The initial overpotential of the prepared FeCo/C@Ni(OH)(2) catalyst is as low as 212 mV and the Tafel slope is smaller compared with the precursor materials. The composite materials revealed enhanced cycle stability which can maintain more than 90% of initial current density after running for 10 h under 100 mV overpotential. The improvement of OER activity is ascribed to the FeCo/C nanocubes, which can not only improve the charge transport of the material, but also prevent the agglomeration of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. The exciting features of FeCo/C@Ni(OH)(2) nanocomposite open up the possibilities of preparing efficient and stable non-noble metal catalysts for OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effect of Water and Alkali-Ion Content on the Structure of Manganese(II)
   Hexacyanoferrate(II) by a Joint Operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
   and Chemometric Approach
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) is made of earth-abundant elements by a safe and easy synthesis. The material features a higher specific capacity at a higher potential than other Prussian blue analogs. However, the effect of hydration is critical to determine the electrochemical performance as both the electrochemical behavior and the reaction dynamics are affected by interstitial/structural water and adsorbed water. In this study, the electrochemical activity of MnHCF is investigated by varying the interstitial ion content through a joint operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and chemometric approach, with the intent to assess the structural and electronic modifications that occur during Na release and Li insertion, as well as the overall dynamic evolution of the system. In MnHCF, both the Fe and Mn centers are electrochemically active and undergo reversible oxidation during the interstitial ion extraction (Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+). The adsorption of water results in irreversible capacity during charge but only on the Fe site, which is suggested by our chemometric analysis. The local environment of Mn experiences a substantial yet reversible Jahn-Teller effect upon interstitial ion removal because of the formation of trivalent Mn, which is associated with a decrease of the equatorial Mn-N bond lengths by 10 %.

TI In-situ Raman spectroscopic insight into charge
   delocalization-improved electrical conductivity in metal-cyanide
   frameworks
SO NANOSCALE
AB Porous crystalline materials (PCMs) have attracted widespread attention due to their high porosity and chemical tunability. To solve the problem of the low electrical conductivity of traditional PCMs, a guest-promoted approach has been developed to impart electrical conductivity, whereas microscopic understanding of this process from experiments is largely lacking. Here we use in-situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SERS) to investigate the microscopic mechanism of the enhanced electrical conductivity in metal-cyanide frameworks, in Prussian Blue (PB), induced by alkali metal ions. The EC-SERS result demonstrates that the charge is localized around the iron atom in PB and becomes delocalized on the CN bond after insertion of the alkali metal ions, verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The enhanced electrical conductivity of PCMs promoted by the guest via the through-bond mechanism instead of the through-space hopping mechanism in pristine PB, offers a new approach to develop conductive PCMs.

TI Size-Dependent Synthesis of Hollow Co3O4 Nanocubes
   Derived from Co-Fe PBA as Battery-Type Electrode Materials for Hybrid
   Supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Hollow nanostructures with enlarged surface areas are highly attractive electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this work, the size-dependent synthesis of hollow Co3O4 nanocubes via a facile ionic exchange reaction between Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and alkali solution is reported. By adjusting the concentration of sodium citrate to control the reaction kinetics during nucleation and growth, four different sizes of Co-Fe PBAs were synthesized. It was also found that a Co-Fe PBA of about 140 nm can be easily converted into a well-defined internal hollow structure, while Co-Fe PBAs with smaller or larger sizes are challenged in generating a hollow structure. Benefitting from the inner voids and thin shell architecture, the derived hollow Co3O4 nanocubes exhibit a high specific capacity of 296.6C cm(-2) at 2 mA cm(-2), and a rate capability of 64.5% when the current density is increased to 60 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was fabricated with hollow Co3O4 nanocubes as the cathode and activated carbon as the anode, respectively. The HSC provided a maximum energy density of 14.1 Wh kg(-1) at 464.7 W kg(-1). Moreover, it retained the excellent cycling stability of 85.7% of the original capacity over 5000 continuous charging and discharging processes.

TI Direct Observation of Charge Transfer and Magnetism in

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB We have studied the zero-dimensional wcubane molecular correspondent of a Prussian blue analogue Cs-Fe4Co4 at low temperature and high magnetic field by means of L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. We probe the magnetic and electronic structures of Fe and Co separately upon light irradiation, which allows us to observe directly the electron transfer coupled to a spin transition phenomenon within the molecular cubes and to investigate the nature of the metastable photoexcited state. The magnetic moments in the photoexcited state are found to be M = 1.3 mu(B) (Mspin = 0.59 mu(B) with large orbital moment, M-orbit = 0.74 mu(B)) for low-spin Fe-III and M = 1.5 mu(B) (M-spin = 1.08 mu(B) with orbital moment, M-orbit = 0.41 mu(B)) for high-spin Coll at 2 K and 6.8 T. From our results, we evidence that a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the metal ions can be ruled out.

TI Photoacoustic image-guided biomimetic nanoparticles targeting rheumatoid
   arthritis
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) microenvironment (RAM) and its persistent inflammatory nature can promote damage to joints, bones, and the synovium. Targeting strategies that integrate effective RAM regulation with imaging-based monitoring could lead to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of RA. Here, we report the combined use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAsT/I) and Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) to silence the expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNFa/IL-6 and scavenge the ROS associated with RAM. To enhance the in vitro and in vivo biological stability, biocompatibility, and targeting capability of the siRNAsT/I and PBNPs, macrophage membrane vesicles were used to prepare biomimetic nanoparticles, M@PsiRNAsT/I. The resulting constructs were found to suppress tumor necrosis factor-a/ interleukin-6 expression and overcome the hypoxic nature of RAM, thus alleviating RA-induced joint damage in a mouse model. The M@P-siRNAsT/I of this study could be monitored via near-infrared photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Moreover, multispectral PA imaging without the need for labeling permitted the real-time evaluation of M@PsiRNAsT/I as a putative RA treatment. Clinical microcomputed tomography and histological analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the treatment. We thus suggest that macrophage-biomimetic M@P-siRNAsT/I and their analogs assisted by PA imaging could provide a new strategy for RA diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring.

AB Single-phase MxCs (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) were prepared by solvothermal conversion of Prussian blue single source precursors. The single source precursor is prepared in water, and the conversion process is carried out in alkylamines at reaction temperatures above 200 degrees C. The reaction is scalable using a commercial source of Fe-PB. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction confirm that carbides have thin oxide termination but lack graphitic surfaces. Electrocatalytic activity reveals that Fe3C and Co2C are oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts, while Ni3C is a bifunctional [OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)] electrocatalyst.

TI Bimetallic Co<SUP>2+</SUP> and Mn<SUP>2+</SUP> Hexacyanoferrate for
   Hydrogen Peroxide Electrooxidation and Its Application in a Highly
   Sensitive Cholesterol Biosensor
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of a bimetallic Prussian blue analogue containing Co and Mn as outer-sphere metals (CoMnHCF). The material was a solid solution and its characterization revealed a chemical composition of Co2.05Mn0.95[Fe(CN)(6)](2)12H(2)O. The electrochemistry of this novel material showed the existence of two redox waves displaying quasi-reversible kinetics, as expressed by the larger peak-to-peak separation upon increasing the potential sweep rate. Interestingly, the CoMnHCF solid exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide, thus representing an appealing scaffold for the construction of biosensors. As a proof of concept, cholesterol oxidase was immobilized at the electrode surface by using a sol-gel method, and the cyclic voltammograms were recorded at increasing concentrations of cholesterol. The biosensor showed a detection limit of 30 mu M and two linear ranges with excellent sensitivity of 385 mAcm(-2) M-1 between 50 and 150 mu M, and an adequate sensitivity of 80 mAcm(-2) M-1 between 150 and 1mM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first biosensor application of a pre-synthesized bimetallic hexacyanometallate, thus exploiting its potential as an H2O2 electrooxidation catalyst.

TI Ordered colloidal clusters constructed by nanocrystals with valence for
   efficient CO2 photoreduction
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The ability to construct discrete colloidal clusters (CCs) as complex as molecular clusters is limited due to the lack of available colloidal building blocks and specific directional bonds. Here, we explore a strategy to organize anisotropic Prussian blue analog nanocrystals (NCs) toward CCs with open and highly ordered structures, experimentally realizing colloidal analogs to zeolitic clathrate structures. The directional interactions are derived from either crystal-lographic or morphological anisotropy of the NCs and achieved by the interplay of epitaxial growth, oriented attachment, and local packing. We attribute these interparticle interactions to enthalpic and entropic valences that imitate hybridized atomic orbitals of sp(3)d(2) octahedron and sp(3)d(3)f cube. Benefiting from the ordered multilevel porous structures, the obtained CCs exhibit greatly enhanced catalytic activity for CO2 photoreduction. Our work offers some fundamental insights into directional bonding among NCs and opens an avenue that promises access to unique CCs with unprecedented structures and applications.

TI A novel K-ion battery: hexacyanoferrate(II)/graphite cell
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Recently, research on novel and low cost batteries has been widely conducted to realize large-scale energy storage systems. However, few of the battery systems have delivered performance equal to that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, we propose non-aqueous K-ion batteries by developing hexacyanoferrate(II) compounds (so-called Prussian blue analogues), K1.75Mn[FeII(CN)(6)] (0.93)center dot 0.16H(2)O and K1.64Fe[FeII(CN)(6)](0.89)center dot 0.15H(2)O, as affordable positive electrode materials. In particular, K1.75Mn [FeII(CN)(6)](0.93)center dot 0.16H(2)O prepared by a simple precipitation process delivers a high capacity of 141 mA h g(-1) at 3.8 V as the average operating potential, resulting in a comparable energy density to that of LiCoO2, with excellent cyclability and rate performance in K halfcells. Operando X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that the excellent electrochemical performance of this material is attributed to its open and flexible framework, which can realize fully reversible K+ extraction/insertion and a structural change from monoclinic to tetragonal via cubic phases. For the first time, we demonstrate an inexpensive high-voltage K-ion full cell with a K1.75Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.93)center dot 0.16H(2)O/graphite configuration to prove its feasibility as a new promising battery system for an environmentally friendly future.

TI Crafting Spin-State Switchable Strain Profiles within
   Rbx
   Co[Fe(CN)6]y@KjNi[Cr(CN)<
   sub>6]k Heterostructures
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Spin-transition heterostructures have shown promise for inducing large switchable stresses at the nanoscale with a volumetric work density similar to piezoelectrics, but before practical applications are feasible, how heterostructure interfaces and geometry influence the transmission of stress and, in return, how they affect the spin-transition actuator itself, must be better understood. Here, four series of cubic spin-transition Prussian blue analogue (PBA) core-shell heterostructures were developed in order to probe the scaling behavior of the strain induced in the shell by the spin transition of the core. Cubic RbxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](y)center dot nH(2)O (RbCoFe-PBA) particles ranging 100-600 nm were used to prepare separate series of RbxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](y)center dot nH(2)O@KjNi[Cr(CN)(6)](k)center dot mH(2)O (RbCoFe@KNiCr-PBA) core-shell particles with magnetic KNiCr-PBA shells ranging from 15 to 130 nm. A model fit to the strain-modified magnetization extracts the "strained volume" of the shell, and the results are compared with structural changes observed with powder X-ray diffraction. A linear relationship is found between the strained volume of the shell and the volume of the core for thicker shells, where the magnetic KNiCr-PBA shell is influenced to depths greater than 100 nm in response to the spin transition of the RbCoFe-PBA core. For thin shells, the relationship is more complicated, as the volume change in the actuating core and the strain it induces in the shell become interdependent and a function of shell thickness.

TI Pyrolyzed cobalt hexacyanocobaltate dispersed on reduced-graphene-oxide
   as an electrocatalyst of the oxygen reduction reaction in an alkaline
   medium
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Described is the development of a unique electrocatalytic material prepared by heat-treating a composite of a Prussian blue analogue, cobalt hexacyanocobaltate, and immobilizing it on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The pyrolysis process, heating at 500 degrees C, forms a material with catalytic cobalt centers that are active toward the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media. Physicochemical properties of this material containing cobalt in different oxidation states have been elucidated using transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and various electrochemical diagnostic techniques. Experimental results have shown that this material displayed comparable electrocatalytic activity (e.g., onset potential) toward the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media to that of Vulcan-supported platinum nanoparticles. Formation of undesirable peroxide species, as demonstrated by monitoring ring currents during rotating ring-disk electrode measurements, was somewhat higher at the pyrolyzed cobalt hexacyanocobaltate on rGO than with platinum nanoparticles on a carbon black support; however, even in the worst case, these values were below 15%, which demonstrates a high activity of cyanide-bridged cobalt sites. This thermally prepared electrocatalytic material exhibits high stability and tolerance to alcohols such as methanol.

TI Cubic Manganese Potassium Hexacyanoferrate Regulated by Controlling of
   the Water and Defects as a High-Capacity and Stable Cathode Material for
   Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Aqueous zinc ion batteries (A-ZIBs) have been used as new alternative batteries for grid-scale electrochemical energy storage because of their low cost and environmental protection. Finding a suitable and economical cathode material, which is needed to achieve high energy density and long cycle stability, is one of the most important and arduous challenges at the present stage. Potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) is a kind of Prussian blue analogue. It has the advantages of a large 3D frame structure that can accommodate the insertion/extraction of zinc ions, and is nontoxic, safe, and easy to prepare. However, regularly synthesized KMHCF has higher water and crystal defects, which reduce the possibility of zinc ions' insertion/extraction, and subsequently the discharge capacity and cycling stability. In this work, a KMHCF material with less water and low defects was obtained by adding polyvinylpyrrolidone during the synthesis process to control the reaction process. The KMHCF serves as the cathode of A-ZIBs and exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance providing a specific capacity of 140 mA h g(-1) for the initial cycle at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) (1 C). In particular, it can maintain a reversible capacity of 85 mA h g(-1), even after 400 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, unlike the traditional zinc storage mechanism of A-ZIBs, we found that the KMHCF electrode undergoes a phase transition process when the KMHCF electrode was activated by a small current density, which is attributed to part of the Mn on the lattice site being replaced by Zn, thus forming a new stable phase to participate in the subsequent electrochemical reaction.

TI Understanding High-Voltage Behavior of Sodium-Ion Battery Cathode
   Materials Using Synchrotron X-ray and Neutron Techniques: A Review
SO BATTERIES-BASEL
AB Despite substantial research efforts in developing high-voltage sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as high-energy-density alternatives to complement lithium-ion-based energy storage technologies, the lifetime of high-voltage SIBs is still associated with many fundamental scientific questions. In particular, the structure phase transition, oxygen loss, and cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) decay are intensely discussed in the field. Synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering characterization techniques offer unique capabilities for investigating the complex structure and dynamics of high-voltage cathode behavior. In this review, to accelerate the development of stable high-voltage SIBs, we provide a comprehensive and thorough overview of the use of synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering in studying SIB cathode materials with an emphasis on high-voltage layered transition metal oxide cathodes. We then discuss these characterizations in relation to polyanion-type cathodes, Prussian blue analogues, and organic cathode materials. Finally, future directions of these techniques in high-voltage SIB research are proposed, including CEI studies for polyanion-type cathodes and the extension of neutron scattering techniques, as well as the integration of morphology and phase characterizations.

TI A colorimetric biosensor based on enzyme-catalysis-induced production of
   inorganic nanoparticles for sensitive detection of glucose in white
   grape wine
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Sensitive and selective colorimetric sensors have come into a high demand due to their simplicity, rapidity, precision and use of common laboratory instruments. In this study, as a new colorimetric nanoprobe, enzyme-catalysis-induced production of Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) was employed to develop a colorimetric biosensor which was simple and inexpensive for the rapid detection of glucose in wine. Briefly, glucose as the detection target was added into a solution of glucose oxidase (GOx), FeCl3 and K3Fe(CN)(6), which turned the solution color from light-yellow to blue within 10 min. Thus, it could be probed by UV-vis spectroscopy. Unlike common colorimetric methods based on a sole color change mechanism, this method has two paths to generate PBNPs. Because both K3Fe(CN)(6) and O-2 are involved in the turnover of GOx catalysis, they generate K4Fe(CN)(6) and H2O2 that reduces Fe3+, respectively, and both paths finally produce PBNPs. This dual-path method enhances the yield of PBNPs and the detection performance. Under optimized conditions, the method presented a linear detection range of 4 mu M to 0.5 mM (r(2) = 0.998) and a limit of detection of 3.29 mu M, which is comparable to or better than analogues, as well as excellent selectivity. This method also worked well in white grape wine samples with detection results varying within 1% to those obtained by the standard HPLC method. The proposed biosensing method is rapid, simple, low-cost, sensitive and selective, therefore, it is a promising method for daily detection of glucose in food in households and markets.

TI Bimetallic Ni-Co@hexacyano nano-frameworks anchored on carbon nanotubes
   for highly efficient overall water splitting and urea decontamination
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, particularly those employing the earth-abundant metals for their overall water-splitting and urea oxidation abilities, are crucial for energy conversion and storage. To this end, the present work demonstrates a facile synthetic route towards self-standing nanocubiods consisting of nickel-cobalt hexacyano frameworks, commonly known as Prussian blue (NC-PB)-analogue, anchored on carbon nanotubes (NC-PB@CNT) via an ion-exchange strategy. The overall water splitting performance of the NC-PB@CNT films was systematically investigated in an alkaline KOH electrolyte. The optimized NC-PB@CNT film is shown to provide an outstanding overall-water splitting performance with a low cell voltage of 1.66 Vat a rate of 50 mAcm(-2), along with an excellent long-term cell durability of more than 100 h. Furthermore, the addition of urea to the alkaline electrolyte is ascertained to decrease the cell voltage to 1.37 Vwith oxidation of urea at a rate of 50 mAcm(-2). The enhanced overall water splitting and urea oxidation (UOR) performance of the optimized NCPB@CNT electrode are assumed to arise from a synergistic effect between the carbon nanotubes and the framework structures, which enhances the catalytic active sites and provides a facile charge transport pathway between them.

TI Size-progressively-reduced FeCoNi@C nanoparticles spatially confined
   within polypyrrole-derived hollow carbon nanoboxes against
   electromagnetic contamination
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Pyrolytic prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are usually faced with serious agglomeration problem, which restrains their application in the field of microwave absorption to some extent. Given that polymer-based encapsulating layer is propitious for resolving the above issue, herein, with the assistance of polypyrrole (Ppy), a series of carbon-coated FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles (FeCoNi@C) spatially confined within hollow carbon nanoboxes (HCNB) are successfully fabricated using FeCoNi PBAs@Ppy with core-shell structure as the precursors. By quantitatively manipulating the thickness of Ppy encapsulating layer, it is found that there exists a competitive correlation between two kinds of forces with opposite directions under high-temperature inert atmosphere, eventually resulting in distinguishable differences in the configurations of derivatives. Specifically, if the thermal-induced inward contraction (FC) of the inner FeCoNi PBAs core is stronger than the heterointerface interaction (FI) provided by interfacial carbon layer derived from the outer Ppy shell, the derivative will exhibit yolk-shell microstructure, and otherwise, the architecture with hollow configuration can be created. When the thickness of Ppy encapsulating layer is optimized, the resultant yolk-shell sample with moderate Ppy-derived carbon content (ca. 32.6 wt%) delivers a broad maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) value of 5.8 GHz and a desirable minimum reflection loss (RL) intensity of - 52.4 dB, which mainly benefit from its eligible impedance matching characteristic and the synergistic effect of dielectric and magnetic losses. It is believed that this work will enrich the pertinent researches about microwave absorbing materials (MAMs) with outstanding performance derived from polymer-encapsulated PBAs.

TI Nickel-Iron nitrides and alloy heterojunction with amorphous N-doped
   carbon Shell: High-efficiency synergistic electrocatalysts for oxygen
   evolution reaction
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Transition metal nitrides have received a great deal of attention as highly efficient OER catalysts due to their excellent electrical conductivity, which grants them lower overpotential values than precious metal oxide catalysts (RuO2, IrO2, etc.). Herein, we report the characteristics of Nickel-Iron nitrides, alloy heterogeneous nanostructures (Ni2Fe2N, Ni2Fe2N/Ni3Fe, Ni3Fe/Ni2Fe2N), and amorphous N-doped carbon shells differing only in nitridation temperature. Heterogeneous Nickel-Iron nitrides and alloy with amorphous N-doped carbon shells showed superior OER performance such as a low overpotential value of 251 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm2, Tafel slope of 35.0 mV/dec, and great stability even after 24 h. Additionally, this study accurately identified that the heterogeneous nanostructure and amorphous N-doped carbon shell improve the catalytic properties and durability of the Nickel-Iron nitrides and alloy nanoparticles. The morphological control strategy used to produce the heterogeneous nanostructure and amorphous N-doped carbon shell can be applied to improve electrochemical properties or encapsulation in strong alkaline solution.

TI Catalytic reduction of bromate by Co-embedded N-doped carbon as a
   magnetic Non-Noble metal hydrogenation catalyst
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB While catalytic hydrogenation of bromate represents a useful technique for eliminating carcinogenic bromate, expensive noble-metal catalysts and excessive H2 gas are usually required, impeding large-scale implementation of this technique. As borohydride is an alternative source for releasing H2 in a more controllable way and nonnoble metal catalysts (e.g., Co) can catalyze hydrolysis of borohydride to generate H2, it is promising to employ Co and borohydride for hydrogenation of bromate. Moreover, it is even more practical to develop heterogeneous catalysts with magnetism for easier handle and recovery of catalysts. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop such a magnetic heterogeneous catalyst for bromate reduction by using borohydride. Herein, a special Co-based catalyst is fabricated by transforming Co-substituted prussian blue analogue into Co-embedded Ndoped carbon (Co@NC) composite through carbonization. Co@NC also exhibits a higher catalytic activity for reducing bromate than the commercial Co3O4 as Co@NC could accelerate hydrolysis of NaBH4 to generate H2 gas much faster. The activation energy (Ea) of bromate reduction by Co@NC is also much lower than the reported Ea. Co@NC could still completely remove bromate and reduce it to bromide under alkaline conditions, and Co@NC also exhibit a very high selectivity towards bromate reduction in the presence of other anions. Moreover, Co@NC could be also reused for multiple-cycles to continuously reduce bromate to bromide. These features demonstrate that Co@NC is certainly an advantageous and convenient heterogeneous catalyst for reducing bromate in water.

TI Self-Templated Synthesis of Porous Ni(OH)2 Nanocube and Its
   High Electrochemical Performance for Supercapacitor
SO LANGMUIR
AB Porous Ni(OH)(2) nanocubes were successfully fabricated by a simple self sacrificial -template protocol using Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as precursor. When treated with NaOH, the simultaneous corrosion of Ni-Co PBA precursor and formation of amorphous Ni(OH)(2) resulted in porous Ni(OH)(2) nanocubes with uniform size of about 100 nm. Due to the large specific surface area and unique regular porous structure, the as-prepared materials showed large specific capacitance, relatively stable rate capability and long cycle stability when used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. With the voltage between 0.00 and 0.45 V versus Ag/AgCl, the specific capacitance can achieve 1842 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g.

TI Metal-Organic Framework Hybrid-Assisted Formation of
   Co3O4/Co-Fe Oxide Double-Shelled Nanoboxes for
   Enhanced Oxygen Evolution
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Rational design of complex metal-organic framework (MOF) hybrid precursors offers a great opportunity to construct various functional nanostructures. Here, a novel MOF-hybrid-assisted strategy to synthesize Co3O4/Co-Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes is reported. In the first step, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67, a Co-based MOF)/Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) yolk-shell nanocubes are formed via a facile anion-exchange reaction between ZIF-67 nanocube precursors and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions at room temperature. Subsequently, an annealing treatment is applied to prepare Co3O4/Co-Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes. Owing to the structural and compositional benefits, the as-derived Co3O4/Co-Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution.

TI Structural Evolution, Redox Mechanism, and Ionic Diffusion in
   Rhombohedral Na2FeFe(CN)6 for Sodium-Ion
   Batteries: First-Principles Calculations
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Prussian blue analogs (Na2FeFe(CN)(6)) have been regarded as potential cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low-cost iron resources and open framework. Herein, the detailed first-principles calculations have been performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of Na x FeFe(CN)(6) during Na ion extraction. The material undergoes a phase transition from a dense rhombohedral to open cubic structure upon half-desodiation, which is resulted from competition of the Na-N Coulomb attraction and d-pi covalent bonding of Fe-N. The analyses on the density of states, magnetic moments and Bader charges of Na x FeFe(CN)(6) reveal that there involve in the successive redox reactions of high-spin Fe2+/Fe3+ and low-spin Fe2+/Fe3+ couples during desodiation. Moreover, the facile three-dimensional diffusion channels for Na+ ions exhibit low diffusion barriers of 0.4 eV similar to 0.44 eV, which ensures a rapid Na+ transport in the Na x FeFe(CN)(6) framework, contributing to high rate performance of the battery. This study gives a deeper understanding of the electrochemical mechanisms of Na x FeFe(CN)(6) during Na+ extraction, which is beneficial for the rational design of superior PBA cathodes for SIBs.

TI Enhanced Photocatalytic Oxidation of Nitric Oxide to MOF-derived Hollow
   Bimetallic Oxide Microcubes Supported on g-C3N4
   Nanosheets via p-n Heterojunction
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB A unique Prussian blue analog-derived three-dimensional (3D) hollow Ni-Co bimetal oxide compound supported on two-dimensional (2D) g-C3N4 nanosheets was successfully prepared using a low-temperature annealing method. A spatial conductive frame was formed owing to formation of a p-n heterojunction between the Ni-Co bimetallic oxide and g-C3N4, which accelerated photogenerated carrier migration and inhibited recombination. The hollow Ni-Co bimetallic oxide had pores that allowed facile gas circulation. After g-C3N4 recombination, the synergistic effect of the two catalysts degraded NO (600 ppb) under visible light with an extremely high conversion rate of up to 59.1%. Cycling experiments and X-ray diffraction results confirmed the stability of the composite catalyst, which has broad application prospects in environmental science.

As advanced batteries need positive electrode materials capable of larger capacity, higher voltage, and lower cost, it is important to search for novel electrode materials. Among various inorganic/organic materials, cyanido-bridged coordination compounds are promising candidates for battery electrodes due to their ability to undergo solid-state redox reaction associated with ion (de)intercalation. In this review, recent results about the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the solid-state electrochemistry of cyanido-bridged coordination compounds are summarized, providing a fundamental basis toward developing cyanide electrodes for advanced batteries.

TI A Compartmentalized Nanoreactor Formed by Interfacial Hydrogelation for
   Cascade Enzyme Catalytic Therapy
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Some cellular enzymatic pathways are located within a single organelle, while most others involve enzymes that are located within multiple compartmentalized cellular organelles to realize the efficient multi-step enzymatic process. Herein, bioinspired by enzyme-mediated biosynthesis and biochemical defense, a compartmented nanoreactor (Burr-NCs@Gl(SOD)) was constructed through a self-confined catalysis strategy with burr defect-engineered molybdenum disulfide/Prussian blue analogues (MoS2/PBA) and an interfacial diffusion-controlled hydrogel network. The specific catalytic mechanism of the laccase-like superactivity induced hydrogelation and cascade enzyme catalytic therapy were explored. The confined hydrogelation strategy introduces a versatile means for nanointerface functionalization and provides insight into biological construction of simulated enzymes with comparable activity and also the specificity to natural enzymes.

TI Progress of nanostructured metal oxides derived from metal-organic
   frameworks as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are the newly crystalline porous materials with outstanding structural, compositional, and morphological features, which have garnered much attention in all dimensions of major scientific and engineering fields, including energy storage and conversion. Various pristine MOFs and their derivatives have been developed and used as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this review, we specifically focused on MOFs-derived nanostructured metal oxides with diverse structural and compositional features that exhibit exceptional lithium storage capacity. These intriguing nanostructures inherit the multidimensional structure of MOF and the advantage of even distribution of metallic species after thermal decomposition, which facilitates fast reaction kinetics of lithium transportation and ultimately improves the battery performance. Herein, we review and categorise the synthetic strategies to achieve various transitional metal oxide nanostructures/composites obtained from BDC/BTC-based MOFs (H2BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), Prussian blue and Prussian blue analogues (PB and FBAs), and other unusual porous crystalline MOF materials. In addition, we will also compare the electrochemical performances of various metal oxides (MOs) nanostructures obtained via heteroatom doping in the pristine MOF precursor or by tuning their structure. Finally, our discussion will focus on the advantages and future developments in design and fabrication of new MOF-derived metal oxide electrode materials with high energy efficiencies in relation with the next generation rechargeable battery applications.

TI Compositing redox-rich Co-Co@Ni-Fe PBA nanocubes into cauliflower-like
   conducting polypyrrole as an electrode material in supercapacitors
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Supercapacitors (SCs) coupled with redox materials have been extensively investigated to maximize the energy density of SCs. Common metal-organic frameworks explicitly used for this purpose are Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). However, their low conductivity and number of external electroactive sites hinder their capacitance and reaction rate. Our work focuses on a material-level optimization strategy, including morphology modification and superstructure fabrication of PBA. We report the synthesis of Co-Co@Ni-Fe trimetallic core-shell PBA nanocubes containing an Fe-II/III redox couple in the Ni-Fe PBA shell over the conductive Co-Co PBA core. This complex underwent a reversible redox reaction and was further encapsulated in a polypyrrole (PPy) network as a redox additive to prepare a novel polymer-encapsulated double-PBA nanocube composite (Co-Co@Ni-Fe PBA-PPy). The composite exhibited a faradaic non-capacitive diffusion-dominated charge storage ability. It yielded an improved specific capacity of 318.1 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) with a capacity retention of 90% over 2000 cycles @15 A g(-1). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor based on Co-Co@Ni-Fe PBA-PPy and activated carbon electrodes delivered a maximum energy density of 20 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 808.9 W kg(-1) within a 1.6 V voltage window. The electrochemical analysis demonstrated a considerable improvement in the charge-storage performance due to an increase in electron transfer, electrolyte diffusion, and electroactive area via strong electronic coupling between the Co-Co@Ni-Fe core-shell PBA and the PPy. Furthermore, this work helps to differentiate the composite's current contributions from the PBA and PPy. The detailed electrochemical characterization steps of these methods concerning redox additives integrated into conducting polymers are provided in this work.

TI Irreversible Structural Changes of Copper Hexacyanoferrate Used as a
   Cathode in Zn-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB The structural changes of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF), a Prussian blue analogue, which occur when used as a cathode in an aqueous Zn-ion battery, are investigated using electron microscopy techniques. The evolution of ZnxCu1-xHCF phases possessing wire and cubic morphologies from initial CuHCF nanoparticles are monitored after hundreds of cycles. Irreversible introduction of Zn ions to CuHCF is revealed locally using scanning transmission electron microscopy. A substitution mechanism is proposed to explain the increasing Zn content within the cathode material while simultaneously the Cu content is lowered during Zn-ion battery cycling. The present study demonstrates that the irreversible introduction of Zn ions is responsible for the decreasing Zn ion capacity of the CuHCF cathode in high electrolyte concentration.

TI Hybrid high-performance aqueous batteries with potassium-based
   cathodelizinc metal anode
SO SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS
AB Aqueous potassium-based batteries (APBs) have been widely studied for their high safety and environmentally friendly properties. However, given the limitation of the electrode material and working mechanism, the APBs need further improvement in terms of the rate performance and energy density to meet the development requirements. To address the above issues, we successfully designed and assembled APBs, for the first time using Zn metal as the anode, K1.92Cu0.62Mn0.38[Fe(CN)(6)](0.968).square(0.032).0.35H(2)O as the cathode, and 2 mol L-1 Zn(SO3CF3)(2) + 12 mol L-1 KSO3CF3 as the electrolyte. This hybrid-ion-battery (HIB) design offers benefits including the following: (i) improvement of the working potential of APBs by selecting Zn metal as the anode, (ii) shortened ion transport path due to the dual-cation storage mechanism, and (iii) inhibition of the growth of zinc dendrite through the electrostatic shielding effect enabled by IC, which originated from the dual-cation electrolyte. As a result, the as-assembled full battery had a high working potential of 1.75 V and excellent rate performance (83.3% of original capacity was maintained at the current density of 10,000 mA g (-1)). Furthermore, the in-situ electrostatic shielding effect, which can significantly inhibit the dendrite growth of the Zn anode and improve the stability of the full battery, was fully revealed by theoretical phase-field simulation and comprehensive characterizations. The fascinating structure design of HIBs sheds light on the development of high-performance APBs.

The experimental evidence for Al3+ intercalation in transition metal oxides, chalcogenides, MXene, and Prussian blue analogues in both chloroaluminate ionic liquids and aqueous electrolytes is analyzed to identify the true reaction mechanisms. Chevrel phase molybdenum sulfide (Mo6S8) is the only proven intercalation material for RABs with unambiguous evidence, different understandings of the Al3+ intercalation mechanism in Mo6S8 are discussed. For conversion-type cathode materials, the discussion is focused on the conversion mechanism of metal chalcogenides, and the unique reversible oxidation mechanism of sulfur and selenium enabled by the chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolytes.

In this study, photocatalysts were obtained by the hydrothermal and photodeposition methods. The optimal photocatalytic hydrogen production from water decomposition was 2641 mu mol g-1 h-1. The results showed that compared with traditional composites, a ZnCdS(Two-Step)/Ni photocatalyst synthesized with Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as the precursor shows better photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the introduction of Ni is found to be a feasible strategy to modulate the performance of photocatalysts, providing a reference for the construction of materials with excellent photocatalytic properties.

   batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are attractive electrode material candidates for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and are garnering significant interest due to their tunable pore size and intriguing electrochemical properties. A border-rich iron (Fe3+) hexacyanocobaltate (FeHCCo) MOF is synthesized via a facile and low-cost co-precipitation method and evaluated as a cathode material for LIBs. The MOF delivered reversible capacities corresponding to 136 and 57 mAh g(-1) at 0.63 and 6.25C, respectively. Furthermore, a lithiation capacity of 116 mAh g(-1) at 1.25C was maintained with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. The high electrochemical performance can be attributed to the highly reversible open-framework crystal texture of border-rich FeHCCo, which may provide new insights on the application of MOFs as viable electrode materials in rechargeable LIBs.

TI Progress on Fe-Based Polyanionic Oxide Cathodes Materials toward
   Grid-Scale Energy Storage for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL METHODS
AB The development of large-scale energy storage systems (EESs) is pivotal for applying intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar energy and wind energy. Lithium-ion batteries with LiFePO4 cathode have been explored in the integrated wind and solar power EESs, due to their long cycle life, safety, and low cost of Fe. Considering the penurious reserve and regional distribution of lithium resources, the Fe-based sodium-ion battery cathodes with earth-abundant elements, environmental friendliness, and safety appear to be the better substitutes in impending grid-scale energy storage. Compared to the transition metal oxide and Prussian blue analogs, the Fe-based polyanionic oxide cathodes possess high thermal stability, ultra-long cycle life, and adjustable voltage, which is more commercially viable in the future. This review summarizes the research progress of single Fe-based polyanionic and mixed polyanionic oxide cathodes for the potential sodium-ion batteries EESs candidates. In detail, the synthesized method, crystal structure, electrochemical properties, bottlenecks, and optimization method of Fe-based polyanionic oxide cathodes are discussed systematically. The insights presented in this review may serve as a guideline for designing and optimizing Fe-based polyanionic oxide cathodes for coming commercial sodium-ion batteries EESs.

TI A biomimetic design for efficient petrochemical spill disposal: CoFe-PBA
   modified superhydrophobic melamine sponge with mechanical/chemical
   durability and low fire risk
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Due to frequent petrochemical spills, environmental pollution and the threat of secondary marine fires have arisen, necessitating an urgent need for petrochemical spill treatment strategies with high-performance oil-water separation capabilities. To address the challenges of poor durability, instability in hydrophobic conditions, and difficulty in absorbing high-viscosity crude oil associated with hydrophobic absorbent materials, the authors of this study took inspiration from the unique micro and nanostructures of springtails' water-repellent skin. We engineered a superhydrophobic melamine sponge using interfacial assembly techniques designated as Si@PBA@PDA@MS. This material demonstrated improved mechanical and chemical durability, enhanced photo -thermal performance, and reduced fire risk. The metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived cobalt-iron Prussian blue analog (CoFe-PBA) was firmly anchored to the sponge framework by the chelation of cobalt ions using polydopamine (PDA). The results demonstrated that Si@PBA@PDA@MS demonstrated excellent super -hydrophobicity (WCA=163.5 degrees) and oil absorption capacity (53.4-97.5 g/g), maintaining high durability even after 20 cycles of absorption-squeezing. Additionally, it could still exhibit excellent mechanical properties, hydrophobic stability, and absorption performance across a wide temperature range (0-100 degrees C), pH range (1-14), and high compression strength (& epsilon; = 80%), with excellent mechanical/chemical durability. Furthermore, Si@PBA@PDA@MS demonstrated remarkable photothermal performance and low fire risk, offering efficient, safe, and sustainable practical value for effective petrochemical spill treatment.

TI Structural Effects of Anomalous Current Densities on Manganese
   Hexacyanoferrate for Li-Ion Batteries
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB A battery management system (BMS) plays a pivotal role in providing optimal performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the eventual malfunction of the BMS may lead to safety hazards or reduce the remaining useful life of LIBs. Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) was employed as the positive electrode material in a Li-ion half-cell and subjected to five cycles at high current densities (10 A g(MnHCF)(-1)) and to discharge at 0.1 A g(MnHCF)(-1), instead of classical charge/discharge cycling with initial positive polarization at 0.01 A g(MnHCF)(-1), to simulate a current sensor malfunctioning and to evaluate the electrochemical and structural effects on MnHCF. The operando set of spectra at the Mn and Fe K-edges was further analyzed through multivariate curve resolution analysis with an alternating least squares algorithm (MCR-ALS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy to investigate the structural modifications arising during cycling after the applied electrochemical protocol. The coulombic efficiency in the first cycle was dramatically affected; however, the local structural environment around each photo absorber recovered during charging. The identification of an additional spectral contribution in the electrochemical process was achieved through MCR-ALS analysis, and the Mn-local asymmetry was thoroughly explored via EXAFS analysis.

   Structure as a Host Material for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promisingelectrochemicalenergy storage devices to answer ever-increasing energy storage demands.Its practical applications, however, are impeded by several technicalobstacles, with shuttling of polysulfides as the main cause. A compositeapproach was developed for the design of effective sulfur host materialsto tackle the issue. Here, cobalt sulfide nanoparticles embedded incarved N-doped carbon nanoboxes dispersed in iron single-atom decoratedmultiwalled carbon nanotube porous structure, S-Co@CCNB/SAFe-MWCNT,were developed as an effective sulfur host for LSBs. The sulfur hostcombines the high electrical conductivity and physical polysulfideconfinement capability of MWCNTs, the excellent polysulfides chemisorptioncapability of CoS2, and the high catalytic efficiency ofiron single-atoms toward polysulfide conversion reactions, to achievea high performance LSB. The S-Co@CCNB/SAFe-MWCNT based LSB delivereda high initial specific capacity of 1432 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, with a decent specific capacity of 538 mAh g(-1) maintained at 2 C. For cycling stability, a specific capacity of550 mAh g(-1) was maintained after a 500-cycle operationat 1 C, giving a low average capacity decay rate per cycle of 0.043%.

TI Bimetallic MOF-Based Sensor for Highly Sensitive Detection of Ammonia
   Gases
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The demand for the detection of ultralow concentrations of ammonia gas is growing. A bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF) comprising Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) was used to achieve highly sensitive and stable detection of ammonia gas at room temperature in this study. First, PB was enriched by using ammonia for improved gas sensing properties. Second, a sensitive membrane with more vacancies was formed by partially replacing Fe3+ with Cu2+ through a cation-exchange strategy. Finally, a capacitive sensor was developed for ultralow-concentration ammonia detection using a Cu-Fe PBA sensitive membrane and interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). To investigate the adsorption efficiency of the designed composite sensitive film for ammonia, PBAs nanoparticles were deposited on a quartz microcrystal balance (QCM) via cyclic voltammetry and a hydrothermal method. Approximately 10 ppm of ammonia was adsorbed under 1 atm by the Cu-Fe PBA film prepared using a reaction time of 36 h, and the adsorption efficiency was measured to be 2.2 mmol g(-1) using the QCM frequency response. The Cu-Fe PBAs were also tested using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory. The introduction of Cu2+ ions significantly increased the specific surface area of Cu-Fe PBAs MOF, and the number of adsorption sites for ammonia also increased; however, its skeleton structure remained similar to that of PB. Then, the capacitive sensor based on Cu-Fe PBA sensitive membrane and IDE was fabricated and the gas sensing detection device was established for ammonia detection. Overall, the developed capacitive sensor exhibits a linear response of 75-1000 ppb and a detection limit of 3.8 ppb for ultralow ammonia concentrations, which makes it superior to traditional detection methods and thus allows excellent application prospects.

TI The adsorption kinetics of CO2 on copper hexacyanoferrate
   studied by thermogravimetric analysis
SO MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS
AB The CO2 adsorption and CO2 adsorption kinetics were evaluated by thermogravimetry on two Prussian blue analogues, K2x/3CuII [Fe-x(II) Fe-1-x(III) (CN)(6)](2/3), with nominally K-free x = 0.0 and K-rich x = 1.0. Differential isosteric heats of adsorption were determined from adsorption isotherms using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and integral values by differential scanning calorimetry. The average differential heats of CO2 adsorption are 28 kJ/mol for x = 0.0 and 33 kJ/mol for x = 1.0. Both compositions show small maxima in differential heat at similar to 1 mmol/g. The integral adsorption heats were determined to be 26 kJ/mol for both x = 0.0 and x = 1.0. The kinetic CO(2 )adsorption/desorption curves can be modeled by a double exponential function describing two parallel processes with different rate constants. The activation energies for CO2 adsorption on x = 0.0 were 6 (1) kJ/mol for the faster component and 16 (1) kJ/mol for the slower one, while the corresponding values for x = 1.0 were 9 (1) kJ/mol and 7 (1) kJ/mol, respectively. The maximum CO2 uptake for both compositions was found to be similar to 4.5 mmol/g, 19.8 wt%, at 1 bar and 273 K. The materials exhibited fast adsorption kinetics and stable cyclic performance at room temperature. The kinetics were slower for the samples with x = 1.0 than for x = 0.0 which may be attributed to interactions between CO2 molecules and K+ ions.

TI Double hook-type aptamer-based colorimetric and electrochemical
   biosensor enables rapid and robust analysis of EpCAM expression
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and participates in cell signaling, migration, proliferation, and differentiation, has been utilized as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapeutic prognosis. Here, a dual-signal readout nonenzymatic aptasensor is fabricated for the evaluation of EpCAM at the level of three breast cancer cell lines. The central principle of this enzyme-free aptasensor is the use of double hook-type aptamers (SYL3C and SJ3C2)-functionalized magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) as capture probes and quasi-CoFe prussian blue analogs (QCoFe PBAs) as nonenzymatic signal probes for colorimetric and electrochemical analysis. Following ligand detachment, the CoFe PBA was transformed to QCoFe PBA (calcined at 350 degrees C for 1 h), with its metal active sites exposed by controllable pyrolysis. We found that the enhanced sensitivity was attributed to the resonance effect of QCoFe PBA with the remarkable enzymatic properties. The dual-signal readout nonenzymatic aptasensor exhibited limits of detection for EpCAM as low as 0.89 pg mL- 1 and 0.24 pg mL- 1, within a wide linear range from 0.001 to 100 ng mL- 1, respectively. We successfully employed this nonenzymatic aptasensor for monitoring EpCAM expression in three breast cancer cell lines, which provides an economical and robust alternative to costly and empirical flow cytometry. The dual-signal readout nonenzymatic aptasensor provides rapid, robust, and promising technological support for the accurate management of tumors.

AB Mass interfacial processes have been considered as one of the crucial factors supporting fundamental research. Due to the low cost and conceptual simplicity, significant advancements have been achieved in the development of methodologies based on piezoelectric devices for in situ determination of mass changes on the surfaces of deposited materials under various conditions. The introduction of nanomaterials for designing sensors and monitoring systems becomes essential to create advanced detection systems for selective sensing of toxic analytes for environmental remediation. The integration of materials with predesignated nanostructures into sensor devices, such as surface acoustic wave (SAW), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and QCM with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring, has led to an immense progress in the sensing applications of toxic target analytes at the nanogram range. Here, an overview is introduced of recent advancement in the fabrication of piezoelectric devices for the interfacial mass sensing of targeted chemical vapors and ions through combination with nanoporous materials including mesoporous materials carbon-based nanomaterials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), MOF-derived nanoporous carbons, Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBA), zeolites and related materials.

TI Recent Advances in Cathode Materials with Core-Shell Structures and
   Concentration Gradients for Advanced Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer excellent potential for meeting the urgent need to develop low-cost and durable large-scale electrical energy storage systems. However, the electrochemical performance of currently available SIBs requires substantial improvement to enable their practical deployment. The cathode material is one of the greatest factors impacting SIB performance. The recent development of cathodes with core-shell structures and concentration gradients offers considerable promise for addressing these issues limiting the implementation of SIBs. Therefore, this review presents the primary factors affecting the development of these advanced cathode materials. First, the study discusses recently developed methods for preparing these materials, including precipitation reactions, ion-exchange reactions, and doping induction. The study further summarizes recent advances in developing layered transition-metal oxides, poly-anionic compounds, Prussian blue analogs, organic molecules, and other cathodes with core-shell structures and concentration gradients. Moreover, the state of understanding regarding the Na storage mechanisms of these heterogeneous cathodes is also presented. Finally, the remaining major challenges restricting the development of these cathode structures are discussed and possible solutions are provided. This review also enables the heterogeneous concepts to be expanded to high-capacity anodes employed in alkali metal ion batteries.

Herein, Cu@NiCo-MOF nanocubes were synthesized using Prussian blue analog NiCo-MOF (Ni3[Co (CN)6]2) as substrate, and the Cu loading and dispersion were improved by allantoin as linking agent (Cu@aNiCo-MOF). Cu@a-NiCo-MOF exhibited a high percentage of Cu+&Cu0 (63 %, with the remainder being Cu2+), which showed high catalytic conversion (63.4 %) and selectivity (0.98) during propargylamine synthesis via an A3 coupling reaction, while NiCo-MOF exhibited very low conversion (3.74 %). The propargylamine conversion rate can reach as high as 8.95 mol/h center dot mol-Cu, which is attributed to highly dispersed Cu and significantly higher than values of reference catalysts.

SO COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electrochemical conversion of NO3  -to NH3 via the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3  RR) is a promising approach for ammonia synthesis and "green hydrogen" storage. Constructing self-supporting and flexible composite electrodes is critical for portable devices of electrochemical conversion of NO3  -to NH3. In this study, carbon fiber cloth is used for a three-dimensional flexible electronic collector, and low-crystalline CoOOH nanosheets (LCCoOOH NSs) grown on carbon fiber cloth were synthesized by potential induced self-reconstruction of cobalt Prussian blue analogues. The as-prepared self-supporting composite electrode exhibited improved NH3 yield rate. Further investigation revealed that the higher valence state of Co and the lower crystallinity are beneficial for NO3 -to-NH3 conversion. This work shows an example of efficient flexible composite electrode for NO3 -to-NH3 conversion.

TI Catalytic Pathway of Nanozyme "Artificial Peroxidase" with 100-Fold
   Greater Bimolecular Rate Constants Compared to Those of the Enzyme
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB We report on the kinetic mechanism of the catalytically synthesized Prussian Blue nanoparticles denoted as "artificial peroxidase". In contrast to the enzyme, whose active site first interacts with hydrogen peroxide forming the so-called Compound I, in the case of the nanozymes, H2O2 oxidizes their complex with reducing substrate. Slow release of the product (oxidized form of the latter) from the nanozymes has been registered. The interaction of substrates with the nanozymes is 100 times faster than with enzyme peroxidases, and the rate-limiting constant for the nanozymes is also 2 orders of magnitude greater: for pyrogallol k(2) = 1.3 +/- 0.1 x 10(8) M(-1 )s(-1) and for ferrocyanide k(2) = 1.9 +/- 0.1 x 10(8) M(-1 )s(-1). Thus, the discovered novel advantage of nanozymes over the corresponding enzymes is the 100-fold greater bimolecular rate constants, resulting, most probably, from their uniformly accessible surface, avoiding the effect of rotation on the diffusion-controlled rate.

TI Conductive polymer composites cathodes for rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion
   batteries: A mini-review
SO COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS
AB With the supply of lithium resources beginning to dwindle, rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted research interests as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries. Developing high-performance and cost-effective cathodes can promote the commercialisation process of AZIBs. Transition metal-based materials, including different phases of vanadium oxides, manganese oxides and Prussian blue analogues are promising candidates due to their reasonable crystal structures to host Zn-ions. However, they are suffering from the low electrical conductivity and structural instability. The modification of these materials by conductive polymers and the formation of composites are demonstrated as promising strategies to solve the problem and improve the cathode performance in AZIBs. In this mini review, we summarize representative advancements of conductive polymer composites as cathodes in AZIBs and provide an insight into their future research directions.

TI Composition-Dependent Electrocatalytic Activity of Cobalt Sulfides for
   Triiodide Reduction in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB A new nanoarchitecture of cobalt sulfide (CoSx) is designed by exploiting a Prussian blue analogue. Depending on the sulfidation temperatures, CoSx materials with different compositions and morphologies are obtained. This investigation of the composition-dependent electro-catalytic activity of CoSx for triiodide reduction reaction (IRR) reveals that sulfur-deficient CoSx is more active than sulfur-rich CoSx. When utilized in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), sulfur-deficient CoSx with a hollow nanocube morphology outperforms platinum (Pt), showing great promise as a Pt alternative. This composition dependency on IRR is attributed to different surface characteristics and electrical properties that vary with CoSx composition. This work highlights the importance of understanding the surface properties of sulfide-based electrocatalysts that are intimately dictated by their compositions as part of a new design principle for a highly active electrocatalyst.

TI Strong metal-support interaction in copper hexacyanoferrate nanocube
   decorated functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes for enhanced
   bi-functional oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB The development of an efficient non-precious metal-based bi-functional oxygen electro-catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for various electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) have attracted attention as potential electrocatalyst materials due to their suitable properties including abundant metal centres, a porous 3D framework, a tuneable morphology, ease of synthesis and cost effectiveness. However, poor conductivity and low chemical stability under harsh conditions hinder their practical application as their activity is lower than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. To address these limitations, we have developed 1D/3D hybrid nano-heterostructures of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) decorated functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) by a simple hydrothermal approach. The crafted electrocatalyst exhibits enhanced ORR and OER activity compared to its parent materials. The improved performance is assigned to the synergistic effect between CuHCF and f-MWCNTs, where the catalytic centre of Cu assists the adsorption and mass diffusion of oxygen species, and the interlinked structure of 3D CuHCF with 1D f-MWCNTs helps in effective electron transport to the catalytic centres. It was observed that the formation of a Cu(OH)(2) thin layer on the surface of CuHCF is also a main factor for enhanced electrocatalytic activity. To support the claims, activity comparison with CuHCF/unf. CNT (unfunctionalized CNTs) and Cu(OH)(2)/CNT is performed. This work provides a new insight towards improving the efficiency of non-precious CuHCF based metal-organic framework electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis, an important class of reactions in fuel cell applications.

TI State-of-the-Art Electrode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO MATERIALS
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) were investigated as recently as in the seventies. However, they have been overshadowed for decades, due to the success of lithium-ion batteries that demonstrated higher energy densities and longer cycle lives. Since then, the witness a re-emergence of the SIBs and renewed interest evidenced by an exponential increase of the publications devoted to them (about 9000 publications in 2019, more than 6000 in the first six months this year). This huge effort in research has led and is leading to an important and constant progress in the performance of the SIBs, which have conquered an industrial market and are now commercialized. This progress concerns all the elements of the batteries. We have already recently reviewed the salts and electrolytes, including solid electrolytes to build all-solid-state SIBs. The present review is then devoted to the electrode materials. For anodes, they include carbons, metal chalcogenide-based materials, intercalation-based and conversion reaction compounds (transition metal oxides and sulfides), intermetallic compounds serving as functional alloying elements. For cathodes, layered oxide materials, polyionic compounds, sulfates, pyrophosphates and Prussian blue analogs are reviewed. The electrode structuring is also discussed, as it impacts, importantly, the electrochemical performance. Attention is focused on the progress made in the last five years to report the state-of-the-art in the performance of the SIBs and justify the efforts of research.

TI Magnetoelectric interaction in molecular multiferroic nanocomposites
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Incorporation of magnetic and electric orders in a form of multiferroics is an interesting topic in materials science. Making a molecular heterogeneous composite by incorporating the molecular magnet vanadium-chromium Prussian blue analogue (V-Cr PBA) and a molecular ferroelectric imidazolium chloride C3N2H5-ClO4 (ImClO(4)) provides a pathway towards achieving the room temperature magnetoelectric effect. The change of magnetization of about 6% is shown as a result of applying an electric field (21 kV cm(-1)) to the composite made of the aforementioned molecular crystals at room temperature. In the ferromagnetic resonance measurement (FMR) under the effect of an applied electric field, a shift of the resonance magnetic field is also observed in the nanocomposites. This work provides a pathway towards molecular multiferroic nanocomposites with magnetoelectric coupling interactions at room temperature.

TI Understanding the Design of Cathode Materials for Na-Ion Batteries
SO ACS OMEGA
AB With the escalating demand for sustainable energy sources, the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) appear as a pragmatic option to develop large energy storage grid applications in contrast to existing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to the availability of cheap sodium precursors. Nevertheless, the commercialization of SIBs has not been carried out so far due to the inefficacies of present electrode materials, particularly cathodes. Thus, from a future application perspective, this short review highlights the intrinsic challenges and corresponding strategies for the extensively researched layered transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds, and Prussian blue analogues. In addition, the commercial feasibility of existing materials considering relevant parameters is also discussed. The insights provided in the current review may serve as an aid in designing efficient cathode materials for state-of-the-art SIBs.

TI Hollow Porous Heterometallic Phosphide Nanocubes for Enhanced
   Electrochemical Water Splitting
SO SMALL
AB Highly efficient earth-abundant electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are of great importance for renewable energy conversion systems. Herein, hollow porous heterometallic phosphide nanocubes are developed as a highly active and robust catalyst for electrochemical water splitting via one-step phosphidation of a NiCoFe Prussian blue analogue. Through modulation of the composition of metals in the precursors, the optimal NiCoFeP exhibiting increased electrical conductivity and abundant electrochemically active sites, leading to high electrocatalytic activities and outstanding kinetics for both HER and OER, is successfully obtained. NiCoFeP shows low overpotentials of 273 mV for OER and 131 mV for HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and quite low Tafel slopes of 35 mV dec(-1) for OER and 56 mV dec(-1) for HER.

TI Carbon coated porous nickel phosphides nanoplates for highly efficient
   oxygen evolution reaction
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Electrochemical splitting of water provides an attractive way to produce hydrogen fuel. Unfortunately, the efficient and large-scale H-2 production is still hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side of a water electrolyzer. Starting from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), we demonstrate a template-engaged strategy to transformNi-Ni Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanoplates into porous carbon coated nickel phosphides nanoplates with mixed phases of Ni5P4 and Ni2P. For comparison, NiO and Ni(OH)(2) porous nanoplates with the similar morphology have also been synthesized from the same precursor. Benefitting from their structural merits and the in situ formed catalytically active oxidized nickel species, the as-derived nickel phosphides manifest excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER superior to NiO and Ni(OH)(2).

TI Guest water hinders sodium-ion diffusion in low-defect Berlin green
   cathode material
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Among Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), NaxFe[Fe(CN)(6)](1-y)center dot nH(2)O is a highly attractive cathode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity of similar to 170 mA h g(-1) and inexpensive raw materials. However, concerns remain over its long-term electrochemical performance and structural factors which impact sources of resistance in the material and subsequently rate performance. Refined control of the [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies and water content could help in realizing its market potential. In this context, we have studied a low-defect Berlin green (BG) Na0.30(5)Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.94(2))center dot nH(2)O with varied water content corresponding to 10, 8, 6, and 2 wt%. The impact of water on the electrochemical properties of BG was systematically investigated. The electrodes were cycled within a narrow voltage window of 3.15-3.8 V vs. Na/Na+ to avoid undesired phase transitions and side reactions while preserving the cubic structure. We demonstrate that thermal dehydration leads to a significantly improved cycling stability of over 300 cycles at 15 mA g(-1) with coulombic efficiency of >99.9%. In particular, the electrode with the lowest water content exhibited the fastest Na+-ion insertion/extraction as evidenced by the larger CV peak currents during successive scans compared to hydrated samples. The results provide fundamental insight for designing PBAs as electrode materials with enhanced electrochemical performance in energy storage applications.

TI Mechanistic insights into the electrolyte effects on the electrochemical
   nitrogen reduction reaction using copper hexacyanoferrate/f-MWCNT
   nano-composites
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Developing an efficient, selective, and stable electrocatalysis system for the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) is a promising strategy for the green and sustainable production of ammonia. The activity, selectivity, and stability of various electrocatalysts in different electrolyte solvents, mainly acidic and alkaline electrolytes, are commonly compared in the literature. However, a mechanistic insight into the effect of these electrolytes on ENRR activity is lacking. Herein we demonstrate that the acidity or alkalinity of the electrolyte is a key factor in determining the rate-limiting step and, by extension, the ENRR performance of an electrochemical setup for the electroproduction of ammonia. Our results from ex situ X-ray photoelectron, Raman, and FTIR spectroscopy analysis of the fresh and spent Cu-hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue analogue-decorated functionalized carbon nanotube (CuFe PBA/f-CNT) catalyst reveal that NH4+-species are more strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface during the ENRR in acidic than in alkaline electrolytes. The results of our detailed rotating ring-disc electrode voltammetry studies suggest that the ENRR over CuFe PBA/f-CNT is mostly controlled by surface adsorption in an acidic electrolyte and by mass transport in an alkaline electrolyte. In situ Raman spectroscopy confirms this finding and shows that the leaching of Fe(CN)6 species from the CuFe PBA/f-CNT composite in an alkaline electrolyte greatly affects the ENRR performance. We believe that the work presented herein offers a new insight into the mechanistic aspects of the ENRR in different electrolyte systems and hence can prove very valuable for the development of effective ENRR electrode/electrolyte systems for practical applications.
   Developing an efficient, selective, and stable electrocatalysis system for the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) is a promising strategy for the green and sustainable production of ammonia.

TI Large breathing effect induced by water sorption in a remarkably stable
   nonporous cyanide-bridged coordination polymer
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB While metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are at the forefront of cutting-edge porous materials, extraordinary sorption properties can also be observed in Prussian Blue Analogs (PBAs) and related materials comprising extremely short bridging ligands. Herein, we present a bimetallic nonporous cyanide-bridged coordination polymer (CP) {[Mn(imH)](2)[Mo(CN)(8)]}(n) (1Mn; imH = imidazole) that can efficiently and reversibly capture and release water molecules over tens of cycles without any fatigue despite being based on one of the shortest bridging ligands known - the cyanide. The sorption performance of {[Mn(imH)](2)[Mo(CN)(8)]}(n) matches or even outperforms MOFs that are typically selected for water harvesting applications with perfect sorption reversibility and very low desorption temperatures. Water sorption in 1Mn is possible due to the breathing effect (accompanied by a dramatic cyanide-framework transformation) occurring in three well-defined steps between four different crystal phases studied structurally by X-ray diffraction structural analysis. Moreover, the capture of H2O by 1Mn switches the EPR signal intensity of the Mn-II centres, which has been demonstrated by in situ EPR measurements and enables monitoring of the hydration level of 1Mn by EPR. The sorption of water in 1Mn controls also its photomagnetic behavior at the cryogenic regime, thanks to the presence of the [mo(IV)(CN)(8)](4-) photomagnetic chromophore in the structure. These observations demonstrate the extraordinary sorption potential of cyanide-bridged CPs and the possibility to merge it with the unique physical properties of this class of compounds arising from their bimetallic character (e.g. photomagnetism and long-range magnetic ordering).

TI Probe and analogue: Double roles of thionine for aloe-emodin selective
   and sensitive ratiometric detection
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB Molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) has been employed for electrochemical sensor preparation with good selectivity. However, to restrict the non-specific adsorption, the conductivity of MIP is usually unsatisfying, which limits its sensitivity for template detection. To achieve both of selectivity and sensitivity, a MIP electrochemical sensor was designed and fabricated by the electropolymerization of pyrrole in the presence of aloe-emodin (AE, template molecule) on carbon nanoparticles modified electrode in this work. Thionine (TH), being added in solution in advance, played double roles for AE recognition and detection. As an analogue of AE, TH was adsorbed into imprinted cavities and then was replaced by AE, indicating the good selectivity of the sensor. This replacement of TH by AE was also demonstrated by the result of computational simulation. As an electro-active probe, the peak current of TH decreased and peak current of AE increased based on the replacement of TH by AE. A current ratiometric signal defined as vertical bar Delta i(AE)vertical bar/vertical bar Delta i(TH)vertical bar was used for AE sensitive detection. Thus, the replacements of TH by AE demonstrated that the sensor possessed high sensitivity and good selectivity. A linear range of 1.0 x 10(-7)-1.0 x 10(-4) mol/L for AE detection was obtained with a limit of detection of 7.5 x 10(-8) mol/L. And the sensor has been applied to analyze AE in real samples with satisfactory results. The simple, smart, and effective strategy presented in this work can be further used to prepare electrochemical sensors for other compounds selective recognition and sensitive detection.

TI Coupling NiCoS and CoFeS Frame/Cagelike Hybrid as an Efficient
   Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Engineering earth-rich, high-efficiency, and nonprecious electrocatalysts is an essential demand for water electrolysis to obtain clean and sustainable fuels. In this research, novel hybrid electrocatalysts based on coupling a hierarchical porous NiCo-mixed metal sulfide with a nanosheet structure (denoted as NiCoS) and a novel three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous open-cage/framelike structure of CoFeS are designed for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this regard, the single-step synthesis of a cobalt iron Prussian blue analog (CoFe PBA) frame/cagelike structure was performed without any etching step. Following a comparative study, CoFe PBA precursors were converted and doped with S, Se, and P vapors (CoFeS, CoFeSe, and CoFeP) by annealing the precursors with sulfur, selenium, and sodium hypophosphite powders, respectively. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that CoFe doped with S and Se almost have similar performances for OER and are better than the P-doped one. In the last step, NiCoS nanosheet arrays were electrodeposited as a shell layer on CoFe (S, Se, and P) to examine their effect on the catalytic activity toward OER, and CoFeS@NiCoS showed better catalytic activity than CoFeSe@NiCoS and CoFeP@NiCoS. It can show the lowest overpotential of 293 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 40.6 mV dec(-1) and has pre-eminent long-range catalytic durability in 1.0 M KOH. This performance was comparable to those of noble-metal-free and commercial RuO2 catalysts. Its excellent electrocatalytic activity benefits from the frame/cagelike and nanosheet structures and good synergistic effects between multiple hybrid components (Ni, Co, Fe, and S), which leads to producing highly exposed active sites and accelerating mass and electron transport. This study represents an efficient approach to rationally design and synthesize three-dimensional porous architecture catalysts based on transition metals as highly efficient nonprecious electrocatalysts for the energy-pertinent reaction.

TI Exploring the Failure Mechanisms and Embrittlement of Liquid
   Metal-Coated Zinc Anodes in Aqueous Zn-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Liquid metal coatings are applied to the surfaces of metallic zinc anodes in rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries to promote dendrite-free zinc plating and stripping, enhance electron transport, and improve the overall electrochemical cycling performance. In this study, we utilized a Ga-Sn-Zn eutectic alloy as a surface coating on the Zn anode in a mildly acidic 1 M ZnSO4 electrolyte, both in symmetric and full cells incorporating copper hexacyanoferrate as the cathode. The Ga-Sn-Zn coating exhibited promising performance during the initial stages of cycling, up to 200 cycles at 8C. However, during extended cycling periods up to 1000 cycles at 1C, erratic behavior was observed. Postmortem analyses revealed an inherent instability of the Ga-Sn-Zn alloy, resulting in the rapid loss of its characteristic liquid nature and its transformation into a crystalline solid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed compositional changes in the alloy with depletion of both Ga and Sn from the surface. These changes led to embrittlement of the entire anode, causing it to shatter, even upon light handling during cell disassembly. The cells with the Ga-Sn-Zn alloy displayed severe erratic electrochemical behavior in later stages of cycling, leading to premature failure. These findings underscore the need for a thorough assessment of Ga-based liquid metal alloys as a protective anode coating against dendritic growth in aqueous Zn-ion batteries, as it compromises the overall mechanical stability of Zn electrodes.

TI FeP-CoP Nanocubes In Situ Grown on
   Ti3C2Tx MXene as Efficient
   Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Owing to the tunable structure and component, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and their derivatives have attracted great interest for a variety of applications, especially oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, PBA-derived FeP-CoP nanocubes dispersed on Ti3C2Tx MXene have been fabricated by in situ coprecipitation and subsequent phosphorization process. We found that Ti3C2Tx MXene reduced the size of FeP-CoP nanocubes leading to more active sites, and the strong coupling interaction between FeP-CoP and Ti3C2Tx MXene resulted in higher intrinsic activities and faster charge transfer kinetics. Thus, the optimized FeP-CoP/Ti3C2Tx-5 delivers a low overpotential of 270 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 49.1 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides an efficient strategy to prepare metal phosphides and MXene hybrids with unique structures for electrocatalytic water splitting.

SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB In order to design an efficient advanced oxidation system to improve the inherent limitations in removing refractory organic pollutants, we couple photocatalysis and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation technology to establish a tandem hybrid catalysis system inspired by series hybrid electric vehicles. Among them, Bi2MoO6, as an electric power source, can be driven by fuel (light) to generate continuous power (electron) input into the prussian blue analogues (PBA) through the transmission shaft polyaniline (PANI), allowing it to respond quickly and continuously activate PMS. Therefore, it exhibits excellent catalytic performance to degrade DC increased by 55%, and the catalytic rate constant k increased by 7 times compared with the PMS alone. Continuous flow experiments are explored to reveal the feasibility of engineering applications. This study provides a new strategy of tandem hybrid catalysis system to drive future advanced water treatment technologies.

TI Electrochromic Sensor Augmented with Machine Learning for Enzyme-Free
   Analysis of Antioxidants
SO ACS SENSORS
AB Our study presents an electrochromic sensor that operates without the need for enzymes or multiple oxidant reagents. This sensor is augmented with machine learning algorithms, enabling the identification, classification, and prediction of six different antioxidants with high accuracy. We utilized polyaniline (PANI), Prussian blue (PB), and copper-Prussian blue analogues (Cu-PBA) at their respective oxidation states as electrochromic materials (ECMs). By designing three readout channels with these materials, we were able to achieve visual detection of antioxidants without relying on traditional "lock and key" specific interactions. Our sensing approach is based on the direct electrochemical reactions between oxidized electrochromic materials (ECMsox) as electron acceptors and various antioxidants, which act as electron donors. This interaction generates unique fingerprint patterns by switching the ECMsox to reduced electrochromic materials (ECMsred), causing their colors to change. Through the application of density functional theory (DFT), we demonstrated the molecular-level basis for the distinct multicolor patterns. Additionally, machine learning algorithms were employed to correlate the optical patterns with RGB data, enabling complex data analysis and the prediction of unknown samples. To demonstrate the practical applications of our design, we successfully used the EC sensor to diagnose antioxidants in serum samples, indicating its potential for the on-site monitoring of antioxidant-related diseases. This advancement holds promise for various applications, including the real-time monitoring of antioxidant levels in biological samples, the early diagnosis of antioxidant-related diseases, and personalized medicine. Furthermore, the success of our electrochromic sensor design highlights the potential for exploring similar strategies in the development of sensors for diverse analytes, showcasing the versatility and adaptability of this approach.

TI Low cost & quasi solid state
   Na2Mn0.5Ni0.5Fe(CN)6//NaxFe2O3 hybrid Na-ion batteries for
   solar energy storage
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Herein, we have explored low cost Prussian blue analogues (PBA), namely Na2MnFe(CN)(6) (Mn-PBA) and Na2Mn0.5Ni0.5Fe(CN)(6) (MnNi-PBA), as positive electrodes and iron oxides, namely Fe2O3 and Na-incorporated Fe2O3 (NaxFe2O3), as negative electrodes for quasi solid state Na-ion batteries. The detailed electrochemical characterization reveals the fact that MnNi-PBA shows superior positive electrode performances to Mn-PBA, while NaxFe2O3 depicts improved negative electrode performances with respect to Fe2O3. The comparative electrode performance data are corroborated by bond-valence energy landscape (BVEL) and density of states (DOS) calculations. Moreover, a 1.6 V full cell with MnNi-PBA positive and NaxFe2O3 negative electrodes is assembled in organic-inorganic hybrid hydrogel electrolyte, which demonstrates a specific capacity of 48 mA h g(-1) (@ 50 mA g(-1)), an energy density of 77 W h kg(-1) (@ 118 W kg(-1)), a power density of 803 W kg(-1) (@ 56 W h kg(-1)) and good cycle life (80% capacity retention after 250 cycles at 50 mA g(-1)) in the 0-1.6 V regime. Further, to validate the solar energy storage applications, a 3.2 V prototype device is fabricated by the series connection of two 1.6 V cells, which is capable to illuminate a 3 V/270 mW light-emitting diode (LED) setup, and successfully demonstrates a one week-long solar-charge/LED-discharge cycling module.

TI Complementary performance improved crystalline N-doped carbon
   encapsulated CoFe/mesoporous N-doped graphene foam as bifunctional
   catalyst
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Future energy conversion that will replace fossil energy can be expected from oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) among high-performance bi-functional electrocatalysts. Herein, a hybrid material, CoFe@N-C/MNGF containing an N-doped carbon shell on the surface of CoFe alloy nanoparticles and three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous N-doped graphene foam with exposed active sites as an electron transfer substrate has been successfully synthesized to replace noble-metal catalysts. The electrocatalytic performance of CoFe@N-C/MNGF demonstrates better OER activity in 0.1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte with a remarkably low overpotential of 330 mV and low Tafel plot 130.6 mV.dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). And CoFe@N-C/MNGF has considerable ORR performance in terms of catalyst activity, electron transfer number and stability, which suggests its usefulness as a suitable replacement for ORR catalysts based on noble-metal used for cathode electrode of alkaline fuel cells. In particular, it showed a potential of 0.87 V in 0.1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte and low Tafel plot 71.7 mV.dec(-1) at 5 mA.cm(-2) and the number of electrons (n) transferred was estimated to be 2.1-3.61 at 0.15 to 0.35 V. Based on these results, this study provides new insights into a cost-efficient non-noble metal bi-functional electrocatalyst.

TI One-step prepared cobalt-based nanosheet as an efficient heterogeneous
   catalyst for activating peroxymonosulfate to degrade caffeine in water
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Two-dimensional (2D) planar cobalt-containing materials are promising catalysts for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade contaminants because 2D sheet-like morphology provides large reactive surfaces. However, preparation of these sheet-supported cobaltic materials typically involves multiple steps and complex reagents, making them less practical for PMS activation. In this study, a cobalt based nanosheet (CONS) is particularly developed using a one-step hydrothermal process with a single reagent in water. The resulting CoNS can exhibit a thickness as thin as a few nanometers and 2-D morphology. CoNS is also primarily comprised of cobalt species in a coordinated form of Prussian Blue analogue, which consists of both Co3+ and Co2+. These features make CoNS promising for activating PMS in aqueous systems. As degradation of an emerging contaminant, caffeine, is selected as a representative reaction, CoNS not only successfully activates PMS to fully degrade caffeine in 20 min but also exhibits a much higher catalytic activity than the most common PMS activator, Co3O4. Via studying inhibitive effects of radical scavengers, caffeine degradation by CoNS-activated PMS is primarily attributed to sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals to a lesser extent. The degradation products of caffeine by CoNS-activated PMS are also identified and a potential degradation pathway is proposed. Moreover, CoNS could be also re-used to activate PMS for caffeine degradation without activity loss. These results indicate that CoNS is a conveniently prepared and highly effective and stable 2-D catalyst for aqueous chemical oxidation reactions. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Sodium-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention in the field of sustainable electrochemical energy storage, owing to their abundant resources and cost-effectiveness. However, their practical application is hindered by poor electrochemical performance under low-temperature (LT) environments. The kinetics of electrode reactions of cathode materials are notably hindered at LT, which makes the search for cathode materials with excellent LT performance a research hotspot.

AB Constructing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hollow architectures with structural and compositional complexity and integrating MOFs with other functional materials may result in synergistically enhancing the inherent performance and endow them with novel functionalities. Herein, a MOF-based self-templating strategy was carried out to construct triple-shelled NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH)@CoFe-Prussian blue analogue (PBA)@NiCo-LDH hollow cubes, starting with a two-step ion-exchange reaction of Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) cubes with [Fe(CN)6]3- and Ni2+ ions, followed by the deposition of NiCo-LDH on the surface. Owing to the intrinsic structural advantages, triple-shelled NiCo-LDH@CoFe-PBA@NiCo-LDH hollow cubes exhibited significant adsorption capacity and fast adsorption kinetics of Congo red (CR). The maximum adsorption capacity can reach up to 416 mg/g at 25 degrees C.

TI A Fast and Highly Stable Aqueous Calcium-Ion Battery for Sustainable

SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Aqueous alkali-ion batteries are gaining traction as a low-cost, sustainable alternative to conventional organic lithium-ion batteries. However, the rapid degradation of commonly used electrode materials, such as Prussian Blue Analogs and carbonyl-based organic compounds, continues to challenge the economic viability of these devices. While stability issues can be addressed by employing highly concentrated water-in-salt electrolytes, this approach often requires expensive and, in many cases, fluorinated salts. Here, we show that replacing monovalent K+ ions with divalent Ca2+ ions in the electrolyte significantly enhances the stability of both a copper hexacyanoferrate cathode and a polyimide anode. These findings have direct implications for developing an optimized aqueous Ca-ion battery that demonstrates exceptional fast-charging capabilities and ultra-long cycle life and points toward applying Ca-based batteries for large-scale energy storage.

TI Hierarchical Metal-Organic Framework Hybrids: Perturbation-Assisted
   Nanofusion Synthesis
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB CONSPECTUS: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a new family of microporous materials; however, microporous-mesoporous hierarchical MOF materials have been less investigated because of the lack of simple, reliable methods to introduce mesopores to the crystalline microporous particles. State-of-the-art MOF hierarchical materials have been prepared by ligand extension methods or by using a template, resulting in intrinsic mesopores of longer ligands or replicated pores from template agents, respectively. However, mesoporous MOF materials obtained through ligand extension often collapse in the absence of guest molecules, which dramatically reduces the size of the pore aperture. Although the template-directed strategy allows for the preparation of hierarchical materials with larger mesopores, the latter requires a template removal step, which may result in the collapse of the implemented mesopores. Recently, a general template-free synthesis of hierarchical microporous crystalline frameworks, such as MOFs and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), has been reported. This new method is based on the kinetically controlled precipitation (perturbation), with simultaneous condensation and redissolution of polymorphic nanocrystallites in the mother liquor. This method further eliminates the use of extended organic ligands and the micropores do not collapse upon removal of trapped guest solvent molecules, thus yielding hierarchical MOF materials with intriguing porosity in the gram scale. The hierarchical MOP materials prepared in this way exhibited exceptional properties when tested for the adsorption of large organic dyes over their corresponding microporous frameworks, due to the enhanced pore accessibility and electrolyte diffusion within the mesopores.
   As for PBAs, the pore size distribution of these materials can be tailored by changing the metals substituting Fe cations in the PB lattice. For these, the textural mesopores increased from approximately 10 nm for Cu analogue (mesoCuHCF), to 16 nm in Co substituted compound (mesoCoHCF), and to as large as 30 nm for the Ni derivative (mesoNiHCF). While bulk PB and analogues have a higher capacitance than hierarchical analogues for Na-batteries, the increased accessibility to the microporous channels of PBAs allow for faster intercalated ion exchange and diffusion than in bulk PBA crystals. Thus, hierarchical PBAs are promising candidates for electrodes in future electrochemical energy storage devices with faster charge discharge rates than batteries, namely pseudocapacitors. Finally, this new synthetic method opens the possibility to prepare hierarchical materials having bimodal distribution of mesopores, and to tailor the structural properties of MOFs for different applications, including contrasting agents for MRI, and drug delivery.

TI Dynamical Properties of Spin-Crossover Solids Within the Kinetic Spin-1
   BEG Model in the Presence of a Time-Dependent Magnetic Field
SO ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS
AB Spin-crossover (SCO) and Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) materials are investigated in 2D with a three-state Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) model where each spin interacts with its nearest neighbors (nn) and may be either in high-spin (HS) or low-spin (LS) state. The interactions through the system lattice are temperature-dependent to account for spin-phonon interactions. The system is also in contact with an oscillating magnetic field energy. The generated numerical results by the dynamic mean field theory (DMFT) study approach are consistent with those derived by kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations with Glauber dynamics and Arrhenius transition rates. First-order transitions with thermally induced hysteresis phenomena have been observed. Near the hysteresis loops, the model exhibits throughout relaxation curves, some fluctuations in the LS phase, strengthened by increasing temperature where this phenomenon becomes temperature- and magnetic field-dependent.

TI Separation/Concentration-signal-amplification in-One Method Based on
   Electrochemical Conversion of Magnetic Nanoparticles for Electrochemical
   Biosensing
SO ELECTROANALYSIS
AB We propose a separation/concentration-signal-amplification in-one method based on electrochemical conversion (ECC) of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to develop a facile and sensitive electrochemical biosensor for chloramphenicol (CAP) detection. Briefly, aptamer-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs-Apt) was designed to capture CAP in sample, then the MNPs-Apt composite was conjugated to Au electrode through the DNA hybridization between the unoccupied aptamer and a strand of complementary DNA. The ECC method was applied to transfer MNPs labels to electrochemically active Prussian blue (PB). The anodic and cathodic currents of PB were taken for signal readout. Comparing with conventional methods that require electrochemically active labels and related sophisticated labelling procedures, this method explored and integrated the magnetic and electrochemical properties of MNPs into one system, in turn realized magnetic capturing of CAP and signal generation without any additional conventional labels. Taking advantages of the high abundance of iron content in MNPs and the refreshing effect deriving from ECC process, the method significantly promoted the signal amplification. Therefore, the proposed biosensors exhibited linear detection range from 1 to 1000ngmL(-1) and a limit of detection down to 1ngmL(-1), which was better than or comparable with those of most analogues, as well as satisfactory specificity, storage stability and feasibility for real samples. The developed method may lead to new concept for rapid and facile biosensing in food safety, clinic diagnose/therapy and environmental monitoring fields.

TI Electrochemical capacitance and cubic-rhombohedral phase transition of
   sodium intercalated ferrimagnetic manganese hexacyanoferrate based open
   framework material
SO SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES
AB We report a synthesis of a highly crystalline, sodium intercalated manganese hexacyanoferrate open framework structure based on Prussian blue analogues with chemical stiochiometry of Na2xMn[Fe(CN)(6)] (2(x+1)/3)center dot zH(2)O (x = 0, 0.5, and 1) using controlled co-precipitation method. The effect of Na intercalation on structural properties, electrochemical performance along with magnetic ordering are prersnted. The formation of uniformly cube shaped sodium-manganese hexacyanoferrate is evident from field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Infrared spectroscopy shows presence of characteristic absorption peaks of Mn-II-C = N-Fe-III bonds, confirm the formation of manganese hexacyanoferrate. The Rietveld refinement of x-ray data reveals that the compounds are crystallized in Fm3m cubic symmetry up to x = 0.5, whereas, excess Na intercalation (x = 1) leads to a R-3 mH, rhombohedral symmetry. The dc magnetization measurements show ferrimagnetic nature of these compounds. The magnetic transition temperature increases with Na intercalation and was found to be similar to 11, 12.5, and 13.4 K for x = 0, 0.5, and 1. The Mossbauer spectroscopy study confirms low and intermediate spin states of both Fe+2 and Fe+3 ions in the studied compounds, consistence with their magnetic properties. The electrochemical performance of the compounds with Na intercalation in terms of charging-discharging are studied using cyclic voltammetry. The compounds show capacitance values of 182.6 F/g at 10 A/g, 117.5 F/g at 6A/g, and 110.1 F/g at 2.8 A/g for x = 0, 0.5, and 1, respectively, suggesting their suitability as electrochemical capacitors.

TI Dilute Hybrid Electrolyte for Low-Temperature Aqueous Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB A hybrid electrolyte based on low-concentration sodium nitrate with glycerol as an additive was proposed for aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) towards low-temperature performance. Based on this dilute hybrid electrolyte and configured by bimetallic Prussian blue analogue (Ni2ZnHCF) cathode and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode, the full cell demonstrated surprising cycle performance with a specific capacity of 60 mAh g(-1) (>800 cycles) and achieved prominent performance at low temperature. Glycerol effectively expanded the electrochemical stability window of the hybrid electrolyte to 2.7 V from formation of strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules and realized the operation of the cell at low temperature, delivering a stable reversible capacity of 40 mAh g(-1) at -10 degrees C. The hybrid electrolyte of glycerol-water provides a new alternative in development of low-cost, long-lifespan, and low-temperature ASIBs and other aqueous battery systems.

TI Monoclinic Sodium Iron Hexacyanoferrate Cathode and Non-Flammable
   Glyme-Based Electrolyte for Inexpensive Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB One of the key requirements of large-scale grid-storage systems is development of inexpensive and safe batteries. Sodium-ion batteries using earth-abundant Fe or Ti based cathodes and anodes would be ideal candidates for such storage systems. Herein, a new phase of Na-rich and all Fe Prussian Blue Analogue, monoclinic Na2Fe2(CN)(6.2)H2O, is reported as a potential cathode for such grid-storage sodium-ion batteries. This water-insoluble and air-stable cathode can deliver 85 mAh g-1 at an average discharge voltage of 3 V vs Na/Na+ with excellent cycle life (3,000 cycles). Many facets about its sodium storage characteristics are discussed with particular emphasis on the role of interstitial water on the sodium storage performance and its conversion to the dehydrated rhombohedral phase. Its compatibility with a newly developed non-flammable glyme-based liquid electrolyte, 1M NaBF4 in tetraglyme, is also disclosed along with general electrochemical and thermal characterization of this electrolyte for sodium-ion battery application. Finally, three different types of full cells are revealed with either monoclinic or rhombohedral phase as cathode and graphite or the recently reported Na2Ti3O7 reversible arrow Na3-xTi3O7 pathway of Na2Ti3O7 as anode. Full cell energy densities of 70-90 Wh kg-1 (using cumulative cathode and anode weights) could be obtained without any pre-cycling steps. This new cathode and safe electrolyte may hold great promise toward development of inexpensive, non-flammable and highly stable grid-storage sodium-ion batteries. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

TI Constructing asymmetric active
   Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>-OV-Mn<SUP>4+</SUP> sites at the
   Fe2O3-MnO2 interface for
   low-temperature soot combustion
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB Promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species by adjusting the strength of metal-oxygen bonds and constructing interfacial active sites has been proven to effectively enhance soot combustion. Herein, Fe2O3-MnO2 bimetallic oxides (FMO) with a heterogeneous interface were prepared using a simple PBA (Prussian blue analogue) derivation method. The catalysts exhibited superior active oxygen content and strong electron transport capacity. The Fe3+-OV-Mn4+ structure, an asymmetric oxygen vacancy, formed at the interface, and the strength of the metal-oxygen bonds was further regulated at different calcination temperatures, significantly activating lattice oxygen. The FMO-HA catalyst showed the highest activity, with soot conversion temperatures reaching 90 % at 289 degrees C under tight contact and 382 degrees C under loose contact. This work offers a dual regulatory strategy to enhance the production of reactive oxygen species and proposes a rational design for high-performance catalysts for soot combustion.

   Co3O4/CoFe2O4 double-shelled
   nanocubes for selective detection of sub-ppm-level formaldehyde
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB Constructing complex interior nanostructures by metal-organic framework (MOF)-assisted strategy have attracted tremendous attention in the field of material science. Herein, the Co3O4/CoFe2O4 double-shell nanocubes (CCFO DSNCs) were synthesized by a metal-organic framework (MOF) route. The approach included the formation of a zeolite imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67)/Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) core-shell nanocubes (CSNCs) precursor and then transformation to CCFO DSNCs by thermal annealing in air. A series of techniques were employed in order to investigate the morphology and structure of the CCFO DSNCs. The gas sensing properties of CCFO DSNCs were studied systematically. The results showed that the CCFO1 DSNCs sensor showed a high response toward formaldehyde with fast response and recovery speeds, and low detection limit (300 ppb). The enhanced properties were attributed to the double-shell nanostructure and the heterojunction between Co3O4 and CoFe2O4.

TI Spatial charge separation in core-shell dual metal-organic frameworks
   for enhanced CO2 photoreduction
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Flexibly and controllably regulating the functionality of the core-shell system is still challenging, which is largely determined by the shell thickness and core-shell interface. Here, elaborately designed core-shell dual MOFs were constructed via in-situ growth of Cu-HHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) shell with adjustable thicknesses over CuFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA). The thin-shell CuFe PBA@Cu-HHTP heterojunction (CFH-1) improves charge separation and transfer compared to CuFe PBA and thick-shell heterojunction. Density functional theory results indicate the efficient regulation of electron density near Cu site via constructing heterojunction. The photocatalytic CO2-to-CO activity of CFH-1 is improved (29.3 mu mol<middle dot>g(-1)) by similar to 14 times than pristine CuFe PBA. This study provides information on charge separation at the core-shell structure interface to achieve efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion.

TI Linking capacity loss and retention of nickel hexacyanoferrate to a
   two-site intercalation mechanism for aqueous Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> and
   Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> ions
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising cation intercalation materials for electrochemical desalination and energy storage applications. Here, we investigate the mechanism of capacity fade and degradation of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCFe) during galvanostatic cycling in aqueous electrolytes that are rich in either Mg2+ or Ca2+. We combine experimental characterization, first principles electronic structure calculations, statistical mechanics and lattice-percolation modeling of electron transfer to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the degradation of NiHCFe and its partial retention of capacity. Electrochemical characterization of porous NiHCFe electrodes suggests a two-site intercalation mechanism, while spectroscopy reveals the presence of Ni2+ and Fe(CN)(6)(3-) ions in the electrolyte post cycling in Mg-(aq)(2+). Using simple coprecipitation reactions, we show that Mg2+ and Ni2+ can coexist in the lattice framework, forming stable PBAs. Galvanostatic cycling of these PBAs shows that the presence of Mg2+ in the lattice framework results in the dissolution of Mg1.5FeIII(CN)(6) in water during oxidation. We propose that Mg2+ can partially substitute Ni2+ ions in the lattice framework during galvanostatic cycling, displacing the substituted Ni2+ ions into interstitial sites. Based on differential capacitance analysis we show that Mg2+ intercalates into interstitial sites at similar to 0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl and it displaces Ni2+ in the lattice framework at similar to 0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Substitution of Ni2+ leads to Fe(CN)(6)(3-) and Ni2+ ions being removed into the electrolyte during oxidation. Using first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with a statistical mechanics model, we verify the thermodynamic feasibility of the proposed reaction mechanism and predict the fraction of Ni2+ ions being substituted by Mg2+ during intercalation. Further, analysis of the electron density distribution and local density of states indicates that Mg2+ ions can act as insulating defects in the lattice framework that render certain Fe ions electrically inactive and likely contribute to capacity fade along with dissolution of Fe(CN)(6)(3-).

   nanostructures as advanced anode materials for lithium ion batteries
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Nanostructured ZnO and ternary Zn-based oxides have been regarded as promising anode materials for lithium ion batteries. In the present work, we report a facile and simple method to synthesize the highly porous ZnO/ZnFe2O4 hybrid nanostructures using the prussian blue analogue as the sacrificial template. The synthetic process only contains the room temperature synthesis of the precursor with a subsequent annealing treatment. Benefiting from their unique structural/component merits, the ZnO/ZnFe2O4 hybrid nanostructures exhibit excellent lithium-storage performance as anode materials. The first discharge capacity is as high as 998.4 mA h g(-1), and a high reversible discharge capacity of 704 mA h g(-1) is still retained after 200 cycles, indicating good cycle stability. The porous ZnO/ZnFe2O4 hybrid nanostructures could be a high-performance anode materials for lithium ion batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Cyaphide Transfer Reagent
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The cyanide ion plays a key role in a number of industrially relevant chemical processes, such as the extraction of gold and silver from low grade ores. Metal cyanide compounds were arguably some of the earliest coordination complexes studied and can be traced back to the serendipitous discovery of Prussian blue by Diesbach in 1706. By contrast, heavier cyanide analogues, such as the cyaphide ion, C  P-, are virtually unexplored despite the enormous potential of such ions as ligands in coordination compounds and extended solids. This is ultimately due to the lack of a suitable synthesis of cyaphide salts. Herein we report the synthesis and isolation of several magnesium-cyaphido complexes by reduction of (Pr3SiOCP)-Pr-i with a magnesium(I) reagent. By analogy with Grignard reagents, these compounds can be used for the incorporation of the cyaphide ion into the coordination sphere of metals using a simple salt-metathesis protocol.

TI Greenly Synthesized CoPBA@PANI as a Proficient Electrocatalyst for
   Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Its Green Sustainability Assessments
SO LANGMUIR
AB Water electrolysis is a key factor to generate mobile and sustainable energy sources for H-2 production. Cobalt-based Prussian Blue analogues encompassed with polymer support electrocatalysts CoPBA(X)@PANI (CoPBA@PANI-100, CoPBA@PANI-200, and CoPBA@PANI-300) have been synthesized and characterized. The well-designed CoPBA@PANI-200/GC shows a low overpotential (eta(10)) of 301 mV with a small Tafel slope (56 mV dec(-1)), comapred to that of IrO2 (348 mV ; 98 mV dec(-1)) for OER. The conductivity with stability of CoPBA(X)@PANI have been increased due to the synergistic effect of CoPBA with PANI. PANI provides additional active sites and shows strong binding with Co ions, and the even distribution of CoPBA overcomes the sluggish kinetics. The turnover frequency (TOF) of CoPBA@PANI-200/GC (0.0212, s(-1)) was similar to 15 times higher than IrO2 (0.0014 s(-1)) at 1.60 V. Furthermore, CoPBA@PANI-200/NF delivers low overpotential of 274 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits a durability of >250 h with a potential loss of 4.2%. Benefiting from strong electronic interaction between polymer support and evenly distributed CoPBA, CoPBAx@PANI shows higher electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 53.08 mF cm(-2). The solar-based water electrolysis confirmed the practical use of CoPBA@PANI-200/NF (1.57 V) for eco-benign industrial H-2 production. The CoPBA@PANI-200 shows exceptional OER performances as well as favorable kinetics to resolve the sluggish water oxidation. Hence, the cost-effective CoPBA@PANI performances opens a prospective way to boost the efficiency of other cobalt-derived catalysts in renewable energy devices.

   toward robust bi-functional electrochemical oxygen reaction
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The incorporation of a multi-stage porous structure in the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for facilitating efficient material transport processes in zinc-air batteries (ZABs). In this work, a combination of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) templates and acid etching techniques is employed to integrate the micropores of CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA), mesopores formed by acid etching, and the macropores derived from ZIF-67 templates. This integration results in the formation of sc-PBA/Carbides@NC hollow nanobox catalysts with a multi-stage porous structure. This allows maximum exposure of active sites within the catalyst and significantly enhances material transport during electrochemical reactions. As a result, the ZAB assembled with sc-PBA/Carbides@NC catalyst shows a peak power density of 235 mW cm-2 and excellent stability, thus indicating promising prospects for practical applications.

TI PBA@POM Hybrids as Efficient Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution
   Reaction
SO CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL
AB To realize the effective conversion of renewable energy through water decomposition, efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential. In this article, PBA@POM was successfully prepared with a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as the initial structure. A facile hydrothermal process is reported for obtaining PBA@POM by etching the cubic PBA with a strong Bronsted acid, H3PMo12O40 (HPMo). The hollow cube structure not only exposes more active sites but also promotes electron transport, which results in excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER. Compared with the PBA, which initially simply adhered to POM, the optimum PBA@POM hybrids display remarkably enhanced OER catalytic activity, with an almost constant overpotential of 440 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope (23.45 mV dec(-1)). The facilely prepared PBA@POM with good electrochemical activity and stability promises great potential for the OER.

TI Time-dependent nonequilibrium soft x-ray response during a spin
   crossover
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A theoretical framework is developed for better understanding the time-dependent soft-x-ray response of dissipative quantum many-body systems. It is shown how x-ray absorption and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at transition-metal L edges can provide insight into ultrafast intersystem crossings of importance for energy conversion, ultrafast magnetism, and catalysis. The photoinduced doublet-to-quartet spin crossover on cobalt in Fe-Co Prussian blue analogs is used as a model system to demonstrate how the x-ray response is affected by the nonequilibrium dynamics on a femtosecond time scale. Changes in local spin and symmetry and the underlying mechanism are reflected in strong broadenings, a collapse of clear selection rules during the intersystem crossing, fluctuations in the isotropic branching ratio in x-ray absorption, crystal-field collapse and/or oscillations, and time-dependent anti-Stokes processes in RIXS.

TI Novel Co3O4 porous polyhedrons derived from
   metal-organic framework toward high performance for electrochemical
   energy devices
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB Co3O4 polyhedrons with porous structure have been synthesized simply by annealing Prussian blue analogue (PBA) Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) polyhedrons at 400 degrees C in air. The product was characterized by a series of techniques, such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), High-resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) gas adsorption. Interestingly, when evaluated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the Co3O4 porous polyhedrons manifested high reversible capacity (about 1200 mAh g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1)) and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, they also exhibited a high specific capacitance of 110 Fg(-1) when used as an electrode in the supercapacitor. It is suggested that the special morphology and porous nanostructure lead to the promising electrochemical properties. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Spatial Heterogeneity and Strong Coupling of
   Fe<SUP>II</SUP>/Fe<SUP>III</SUP> in an Individual Metal-Organic
   Framework Nanoparticle for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction
SO SMALL
AB The synthesis and characterization of an Fe-II/Fe-III metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocrystal with spatial heterogeneity that arises from the non-uniform distribution of different valence states is disclosed. The Fe-II/Fe-III-Ni Prussian blue analog (PBA) delivers superior photocatalytic performance in the selective CO2 reduction reaction thanks to the strong Fe-II/Fe-III coupling, with CO yield up to 12.27 mmol g(-1) h(-1) and 90.6% selectivity under visible-light irradiation. Density functional theory calculation and experimental studies prove that the spatial heterogeneity of Fe-II/Fe-III in the individual MOF nanocrystal not only directs and expedites the charge transfer within a catalyst particle but also creates the heterogeneity of catalytically-active Ni sites for efficient CO2 photoreduction. The current findings add to a growing literature of materials with compositional heterogeneity and provide a reference for future research.

TI Polyanionic Compounds for Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMICAL RECORD
AB Lithium-ion batteries have the highest energy density among practical secondary batteries and are widely used for electronic devices, electric vehicles, and even stationary energy-storage systems. Along with the expansion of demand and applications, the concern about resources of lithium and cobalt is growing. Therefore, secondary batteries composed of abundant elements are required to complement lithium-ion batteries. In recent years, the development of potassium-ion batteries has attracted much attention, especially for large-scale energy storage. In order to realize potassium-ion batteries, various compounds are proposed and investigated as positive electrode materials, including layered transition-metal oxides, Prussian blue analogues, and polyanionic compounds. This article offers a review of polyanionic compounds which are typically composed of abundant elements and expected high operating potential. Furthermore, we deliver our new results to partially compensate for lack of studies and provide a future perspective.

TI Heterogeneous composites with coexisting spin-crossover and long-range
   magnetic ordering
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB A facile precipitation transformation method at room temperature was employed to efficiently prepare the FeTrz@PB heterostructural composites containing both [Fe(Htrz)(2)(trz)](BF4) (Htrz=1H-1,2,4-triazole) and Prussian blue KFeIII[Fe-II(CN)(6)] with the coexistence of spin crossover (SCO) and long-range magnetic ordering (LRMO). The controllable growth process of these heterostructural composites was fully characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, powder X-ray diffraction, FTIR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersion X-ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and magnetic studies. The size of the PB particles and the appearance of FeTrz@PB can be tuned by controlling the reaction time. Increasing the reaction time leads to the increased ratio of the PB phase in the FeTrz@PB composites. Remarkably, magnetic studies on FeTrz@PB revealed the coexistence of SCO above room temperature (362-392 K) and LRMO at low temperatures (ca. 5.6 K). The high spin (HS) fraction and ZFC/FC intensity gradually increased with the growth time, while the heights of the hysteresis loops decreased gradually.

TI Preparation of Hierarchical Cube-on-plate Metal Phosphides as
   Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting
SO CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL
AB To rationally design efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts, a simple but efficient strategy has been developed to directly anchor prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes on cobalt hydroxide nanoplates (PBA@Co(OH)(2)) via the in-situ interfacial precipitation process. Subsequently, the thermal treatment in the presence of sodium hydrogen phosphite enabled the successful transition into metal phosphides with the hierarchical cube-on-plate structure. When used as electrocatalytsts, the obtained bimetal phosphides exhibited good bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with good long-term stability. Thus, an enhanced performance for overall water splitting can be achieved, which could be ascribed to the hierarchical structure and favorable composition of as-prepared bimetal phosphide for rapid electron and mass transfer. The present study demonstrates a favorable approach to modulate the composition and structure of metal phosphide for enhancing the electrocatalytic ability toward water splitting.

SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB The incorporation of the natural amino acid L-proline in the synthesis to vanadium-chromium Prussian blue derivatives results in materials exhibiting magnetic ordering including chiral magnetic centers. Although the amorphous nature of these materials makes difficult to assess the structural features of these proline-containing compounds, magnetic and spectroscopic data confirms their multifunctionality. They exhibit high-temperature magnetic ordering (T-c < 255 K) and a circular dichroic signal, representing the molecule-based chiral magnets with the highest ordering temperatures reported to date. In addition, the presence of chiral L-proline (or D-proline) has additional benefits, including higher redox stability and the appearance of magnetic hysteresis. The latter was not observed in the parent compounds, the series of room temperature molecule-based magnets V[Cr(CN)(6)](x).

TI Hybrid nanostructures based on gold nanoparticles and functional
   coordination polymers: Chemistry, physics and applications in

SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB During the last decade, the scientific community has become interested in hybrid nanomaterials, especially the ones that combine gold nanoparticles with a second functional component. In this context, coordination polymers are materials that possess potential advantages over conventional inorganic nanomaterials and organic compounds such as chemical versatility, easy processability, high specific area, low toxicity, biodegradability and electronic and magnetic functionalities to name a few. In this manner, the wise integration of Au nanoparticles with coordination polymers in different types of nanostructures has allowed extending the scope of properties and applications of these systems, allowing also overcoming some of the limitations of Au nanoparticles for certain applications. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the different reported hybrid nanostructures based on the integration of colloidal Au nanoparticles with coordination polymers exhibiting either physical properties of interest (e.g. ferromagnetism, photomagnetism, spin switching, etc.) or chemical properties (e.g. electrocatalysis). We have paid particular attention to the enhanced properties and the synergistic effects that can emerge from this association. Along this front, thanks to their improved and/or novel properties, these hybrid materials have become promising nanostructures for several applications, especially in biomedicine, catalysis, magnetism and sensing.

TI Cathode materials of metal-ion batteries for low-temperature
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Energy storage devices have been developed greatly in recent years. Developing forward, they are expected to operate stably in electric vehicles, electric grids, military equipment, and aerospaces in various climates. Unfortunately, these areas require batteries to be repeatedly and periodically exposed to sub-zero temperatures, even extremely low temperatures (-40 degrees C or lower). The low temperature reduces the kinetics of all the activation processes of the batteries, leading to increased impedance and polarization, and loss of battery energy and power, thus restricting their performance. Developing new cathode materials is one of the main strategies to alleviate the low-temperature restrictions. A conventional lithium-ion battery is the most attractive system, which is more adaptive to the practical low-temperature application now. Sodium ion batteries, magnesium-ion batteries, and zinc-ion batteries, which have the advantages of low cost and high safety, are considered potential substitutes for lithium-ion batteries, the electrochemical performance of these batteries at low-temperature has been conducted extensively. This review provides an overview of lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, magnesium-ion batteries, and zinc-ion batteries that can work normally in low-temperature environments, with emphasis on various high-energy cathode materials, mainly including polyanionic compounds, layered oxides, spinel oxides, Prussian blue, and Prussian blue analogs. Specifically, we propose how the conventional low-temperature charge-transfer resistance can be overcome. However, these chemistries also present their own unique challenges at low temperatures. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these materials, as well as the main challenges and strategies for applying them to batteries at low temperatures so that the batteries can still discharge efficiently.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI A flexible cyanometallate coordination polymer electrode for

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Auto-switchable power supply systems on the basis of Prussian blue (PB) coordination polymers can smartly tackle both high energy and high power electricity requirements in seawater. To adapt to the complex underwater conditions, it is very important to make the coordination polymer electrode flexible. In this study, we succesfully grew a PB film on a carbon felt. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed that the PB layer was about 500 +/- 50 nm in thickness. The electrochemical modification of the carbon felt guaranteed a strong coating of the PB layer. The obtained electrode worked effectively under bending and in vigorously flowing water. This PB coating was not detached during working under mechanical deformation. Both high-energy and high-power modes were realized in this system even when the PB electrode was deformed, permitting this seawater energy extraction system to support several electronic devices.

TI Comprehensive Study of Sodium Copper Hexacyanoferrate, as a Sodium-Rich
   Low-Cost Positive Electrode for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB Prussian blue and its analogues are broadly recognized as positive electrodes for sodium-ion batteries, owing to their three-dimensional framework, low cost, and high capacity. However, they suffer from lower cell voltage and poor capacity utilization, which lead to low energy density. Herein, we report sodium-rich copper hexacyanoferrate (NaCuHCF) as a high potential cathode (similar to 3.25 V vs Na+broken vertical bar Na) with high purity and crystallinity, synthesized via the coprecipitation method. The cathode is used without any surface coating or modification. Xray diffraction (XRD) along with Rietveld refinement confirms the cubic crystal lattice phase, which possesses the Fm3m space group. The NaCuHCF cathode exhibits an initial specific capacity of 64 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 0.05 A g(-1) with the electrochemically active Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple. It shows excellent cycling stability retaining 93% of the capacity over 100 cycles, with merely 0.07% capacity fading per cycle. Moreover, the cell (Na broken vertical bar broken vertical bar NaCuHCF) delivers one of the highest energy density of 203 W h kg(cathode)-1 at a current rate of 0.05 A g(-1) with excellent rate capability and minimum voltage hysteresis. Kinetic investigations reveal that the Na+ storage mechanism is controlled by surface capacitive behavior mainly at a high current rate. Additionally, the Na+ (de)intercalation mechanism is investigated by XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses.

TI Chronic Verubecestat Treatment Suppresses Amyloid Accumulation in
   Advanced Aged Tg2576-AβPP<SUP>swe</SUP> Mice Without Inducing
   Microhemorrhage
SO JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB Verubecestat is a potent BACE1 enzyme inhibitor currently being investigated in Phase III trials for the treatment of mild-to-moderate and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Multiple anti-amyloid immunotherapies have been dose-limited by adverse amyloid related imaging abnormalities such as vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) and microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) observed in human trials and mice. Verubecestat was tested in a 12-week nonclinical study for the potential to exacerbate microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) profiles in 18-22-month-old post-plaque Tg2576-A beta PPswe mice. Animals were treated with verubecestat or controls including the anti-A beta antibody analog of bapineuzumab (3D6) as a positive control for ARIA induction. ARIA-H was measured using in-life longitudinal T2*-MRI and Prussian blue histochemistry at study end. Verubecestat reduced plasma and cerebrospinal fluid A beta(40) and A beta(42) by >90% and 62% to 68%, respectively. The ARIA-H profile of verubecestat-treated mice was not significantly different than controls. Anti-A beta treatment significantly increased ARIA-H detected by Prussian blue staining; however, anti-A beta antibody treatment did not impact plaque status. Verubecestat treatment significantly suppressed the accumulation of total levels of brain A beta(40) and A beta(42) and Thioflavin S positive plaque load. Stereo-logical analysis of cortex and hippocampus plaque load similarly revealed significantly reduced area of A beta immunoreactivity and reduced plaque number in verubecestat-treated animals compared to controls. The absence of elevated ARIA events in verubecestat-treated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the level of accumulated CNS amyloid pathology and brain A beta peptides; effects consistent with the desired therapeutic mechanism of verubecestat in AD patients. These data will be compared with longitudinal MRI profiles from ongoing clinical trials.

SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Inexpensive and abundant sodium resources make energy storage systems using sodium chemistry promising replacements for typical lithium-ion rechargeable batteries (LIBs). Fortuitously, aqueous sodium-ion rechargeable batteries (ASIBs), which operate in aqueous electrolytes, are cheaper, safer, and more ionically conductive than batteries that operate in conventional organic electrolytes; furthermore, they are suitable for grid-scale energy storage applications. As electrode materials for storing Na+ ions in ASIBs, a variety of multifunctional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated great potential in terms of having porous 3D crystal structures, compatibility with aqueous solutions, long cycle lives (>1000 cycles), and ease of synthesis.

TI Rapid in-droplet tri-fluid micromixing and concentration gradient
   generation for nanoparticle synthesis
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Multiple micromixing is a pivotal process for complex chemical and biochemical assays involving multicomponent reactions or particle synthesis. This study introduces a unique in-droplet micromixing strategy that leverages periodically spaced expansion-contraction flow within droplets to achieve rapid mixing among parallel segment fluids. We have designed an in-droplet micromixer, integrating a standard flow-focusing droplet generator with a periodically wide-narrow serpentine microchannel, which exploits naturally recirculating vortex flow pairs to induce micromixing and uses regular channel width variations to enhance mixing performance. Sufficient tri-fluid micromixing can be achieved within a mixing length of submillimeter scale that is much smaller than other methods. Furthermore, the platform's capability to generate droplets with multiple concentration gradients showcases its flexibility in manipulating fluidic samples. The strategy is successfully applied in the nanoprecipitation of proteins and the chemical synthesis of Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles, yielding nanoparticles with nondeposition on channel wall, controllable size and high dispersion.

TI Protecting Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cells with Nanozymes to
   Increase Alcohol Production
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB A method was proposed to enhance the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and increase the alcohol yield. This strategy utilized nanozymes, specifically FeCo-Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles (FeCo-PBA NPs), FeCo-N-C, CoSO porous nanocubes (CoSO PNCs), and FeN3P-single-atom nanozymes (FeN3P-SAzyme), to mimic the antioxidant enzymes. When subjected to H2O2 stress, the nanozymes significantly stimulated cell growth and effectively reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as evidenced by the decrease in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Additionally, the decline in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity within the fermentation environment suggested that nanozymes provided protection against cell membrane damage caused by H2O2. This protective effect can be attributed to their inhibitory impact on ROS production. Further results demonstrated that 50 mu g mL(-1) of nanozymes led to an increase in the ethanol yield and total alcohol yield in S. cerevisiae. This approach held great potential for enhancing alcohol production efficiency in the S. cerevisiae industrial fermentation process.

TI Cobalt iron selenide/sulfide porous nanocubes as high-performance
   electrocatalysts for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB A novel series of ternary compounds, namely cobalt iron selenide/sulfide nanocubes, are successfully synthesized as counter electrode (CE) materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which deliver excellent performances. Homogeneous cobalt iron Prussian-blue-analog (PBA) nanocubes are prepared as the templates and are subsequently dealt with selenation/sulfidation processes via hydrothermal methods. Owing to their unique morphology, porous structure, high surface area, small charge transfer resistance and high diffusion coefficient, the Co-Fe-Se/S nanocubes possess high catalytic activity and excellent conductivity, which are tested and verified by electrochemical measurements. Meanwhile, cobalt iron selenide/sulfide nanocubes CEs achieve high efficiencies of 9.58% and 9.06%, respectively, which are both higher than that of Pt CE (8.16%). All these prominent merits make them outstanding and promising participants among Pt-free CE materials of DSSCs with lower production costs and higher power conversion efficiency.

TI A high sensitivity strategy of nitrite detection based on CoFe@NC
   nanocubes modified glassy carbon electrode
SO CARBON LETTERS
AB In the present study, an innovative electrochemical sensing platform was established for sensitive detection of NO2-. This sensor was developed using CoFe alloy encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanocubes (named as CoFe@NC-NCS), synthesized through the calcination of polydopamine-coated CoFe Prussian-blue analogues (CoFe-PBA@PDA). The morphological and electrochemical characterization reveals that the CoFe@NC-NCS possesses high electrocatalytic activity for electrochemical quantitation of NO2-, ascribed to the huge surface area and plentiful active positions, benefiting from the porous, hollow, and core-shell structure of CoFe@NC-NCS. Under the optimal conditions, CoFe@NC-NCS/GCE possessed remarkable sensing performance for NO2- with wide liner ranges and a detection limit of 0.015 & mu;M. NO2- recovery experiments in real samples exhibited recoveries in the range of 98.8-103.5%. Hence, the CoFe@NC-NCS shows great promise for the construction of electrochemical sensor with more potential application.

TI Top-down and facet-selective phase-segregation to construct concave
   nanocages with strongly coupled hetero-interface for oxygen evolution
   reaction
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB In this study, a top-down and site-selective anion etching method is devised to stepwisely carve out the NiCo (OH)(2)/NiS2 concave hetero-cages (CHCs) from NiCo Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cube. DFT calculation investigates that the synthetic mechanism is based on anisotropic reactivity of each etchant acted in different facets of NiCo PBA cube and can be generalized to various heterogeneous combinations by tuning their dissolution and reconstitution kinetics (i.e. NiCoB/NiS2, NiCoP/NiS2). Such strategy without adding extra metal source generates strongly coupled heterointerface with hollow, concave, and ultrathin (similar to 16.2 nm) features, which could harvest abundant active sites, tune the electronic structure, and induce strong lattice strain of Ni. Specifically, the NiCo (OH)(2)/NiS2 CHCs manifest superior activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with an overpotential of 258.0 mV required for 10.0 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 38.3 mV dec(-1), and favorable long-term durability in 1.0 M KOH.

TI Ammonium salt production in NH3-CO2-H2O
   system using a highly selective adsorbent, copper hexacyanoferrate
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Ammonia is a beneficial material that is widely used in agriculture, but its emission into the atmosphere causes air pollution. Recently, Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs (PBA) were found to be ammonia adsorbents with high selectivity and capacity. In this study, we utilized a highly potent PBA adsorbent, copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF), to desorb ammonia and turn it into a reusable form. Because the reported NH3-CO2-H2O system phase diagram suggests the possibility of the recovery of solid NH4HCO3, we examined whether adsorbed ammonia desorbs into the saturated ammonium hydrogencarbonate solution (sat. NH(4)HCO(3)aq). We demonstrated that 40% of adsorbed ammonia desorbed into sat. NH(4)HCO(3)aq. After the desorption, CO2 was blown into the washing liquid, and NH4HCO(3) precipitated, which was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The molar amount of solid NH4HCO3 was almost equal to that of desorbed ammonia. Our findings pave the way for recovery of ammonia as a valuable product from waste gas.

TI MOFs-derived hollow cage composed of ultra-small
   CuO/Co3O4 hetero-nanograins for efficient nitrate
   reduction
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The meticulous design of heterogeneous interfaces presents a promising approach for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of Cu-based materials in nitrate reduction reactions. Herein, we developed a self-templated metal-organic frameworks transformation strategy to synthesize hollow multi-metallic oxide materials with well-defined interfaces. By utilizing novel hollow Cu-Co bimetallic Prussian blue analogs as precursors, a hollow cage composed of ultra-small CuO/Co(3)O(4 )hetero-nanograins was successfully constructed. It was discovered that this structure greatly enhanced the electrocatalytic activity for the conversion of NO3- to NH3, achieving a remarkably high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 (with a maximum FE of 90.68%) at low overpotential ranges. Furthermore, electrochemical experiments and in situ spectroscopy provided evidence that electrochemically induced reconstruction led to the formation of synergistic sites between Cu and Co3O4. This enabled the sequential reduction of nitrate and nitrite on adjacent metal/metal oxide phases, resulting in the rapid generation of NH3.

TI Optical Approach for Mapping the Intercalation Capacity of Porous
   Electrodes
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The intercalation capacity of a porous electrode in real batteries is not uniform spatially due to the inevitable structural and compositional inhomogeneity and site-dependent ion and electron transport features. Reliable methods to quantify the capacity distribution are highly desirable but absent so far in battery research. In this paper, a novel optical technique, oblique incident reflection difference (OIRD), was employed to monitor in situ the electrochemical ion (de)-intercalation behavior of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) porous films. The OIRD signal responded synchronously to the ion (de)-intercalation, and the change in the OIRD signal (Delta I) was positively correlated with the local electrochemical capacity, thereby enabling mapping of the spatially resolved ion storage capacity of the films. Optical analysis further showed that the OIRD response originated from the ion (de)-intercalation-induced dielectric constant change of PBA films. This work therefore offers an intriguing in situ and spatially resolved tool for the study of rechargeable batteries.

TI Magnetic phase transitions in an electroelastic model for magnetically
   ordered spin-crossover solids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spin-crossover and Prussian blue analog materials are investigated in two dimensions with the three-state Blume-Emery-Griffiths model where each spin interacts with its nearest neighbors and next-nearest neighbors and may be either in high-spin or low-spin state. The interactions through the system are strongly dependent on the instantaneous distance between atoms and are magnetic and elastic in nature. Finite-size effects have been detected at finite temperature on the model. The thermal distortion of the lattice configuration due to lattice unit displacements strengthened the thermal spin transition that occurred. The generated numerical results are obtained by two-step Monte Carlo simulations where used thermodynamic parameters allowed to establish a rich phase diagram. Gradual and first-order transitions with thermally induced hysteresis phenomena have been observed. Near the thermal hysteresis loops, the model exhibits throughout relaxation curves lattice configurations evolving through two-dimensional nucleation and growth processes that are enhanced with suitable values of the model parameters.

TI Success and failure in the incorporation of gold nanoparticles inside
   ferri/ferrocyanide thermogalvanic cells
SO ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Thermogalvanic systems represent a means to convert a temperature gradient into electricity, using only redox chemistry. However, the kinetics of electron transfer and physical mass transport of the redox couples are known limitations. In this study we present self-contained gelled thermogalvanic cells (or thermocells) containing the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox couple, which additionally have gold nanoparticles either immobilised at the gel/electrode interface, or distributed throughout the entire gel. Both methods of introducing the gold nanoparticles result in an apparent electrocatalytic improvement, as demonstrated by significant decreases in the electron transfer resistance. However, when used as thermogalvanic cells, only minor improvements were observed in power generation, and relatively rapid dissolution of the gold nanoparticles was observed, to yield passivating gold analogues of Prussian blue. Therefore successful preparation and short-term improvements have been demonstrated, but are offset by long-term stability issues. The relatively surprising instability of the generally inert gold nanoparticles in the presence of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide, particularly under thermogalvanic conditions, is of particular note.

TI Cathode Modification of Sodium-Ion Batteries for Improved energy
   Density: A Review
SO ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS
AB In recent years, with the large-scale commercial application of lithium-ion batteries, the shortage of lithium resource reserves and the rising price limit its development. The sodium-ion batteries as a new type of secondary chemical power supply, with ample resources, high safety, as well as great electrochemical performance, are expected to form complementary with Lithium-ion batteries in the domain of extensive electrochemical energy storage and low-velocity electric vehicles. However, due to its low energy density, it remains challenging to develop high-performance sodium-ion batteries. As is well-known, the cathode material is the essential factor affecting the performance of sodium-ion batteries. In order to solve these questions, cathode modification of sodium-ion batteries aroused wide concern for improving the electrochemical performance. Here, the authors first discuss the challenges of sodium-ion batteries, and review the energy storage mechanism and the causes of the low energy density. Then, recent studies on cathode modification are summarized based on the mainstream cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries including sodium-based transition-metal oxides, polyanionic compounds, and Prussian blue analogues. Finally, the prospects of sodium-ion batteries are proposed, which provides promising strategies for the development and practical application of cathode materials in the future.
   This review explores the current advancements in cathode modification techniques for sodium-ion batteries to improve their energy density. It covers various strategies including elemental doping, new material development, and structural modifications, providing insights into overcoming existing challenges and enhancing the performance of sodium-ion batteries. image

TI Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution driven by platinated CdS nanorods with
   a hexacyanidoruthenate redox mediator
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB We have investigated the effect of hexacyanidometallate [M(CN)(6)](4-) (M = Fe or Ru) redox mediators on the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction driven by Pt-cocatalyst-loaded cadmium sulfide nanorods (Pt/CdS-NR). A larger amount of H-2 evolved under blue LED light irradiation ( = 470 +/- 10 nm) in the presence of [Ru(CN)(6)](4-) than in the presence of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-), despite the more positive M(iii)/M(ii) redox potential of [Ru(CN)(6)](4-) (0.89 V vs. NHE) than [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) (0.36 V vs. NHE). PXRD and IR spectral experiments during the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction clearly indicate that the Prussian white analogue K-2[CdRu(CN)(6)] (CdRu-PW) was increasingly formed, producing a white precipitate, whereas only a trace amount of K-2[CdFe(CN)(6)] (CdFe-PW) was formed in the reaction with [Fe(CN)(6)](4-). The amount of CdRu-PW produced during the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction revealed that the electron source of H-2 evolution is gradually changed from the S2- anions generated following the photocorrosion of CdS to [Ru(CN)(6)](4-) because of effective hole transfer through the Ru(iii)/Ru(ii) redox step in the CdRu-PW (1.42 V vs. NHE) deposited on the CdS-NR surface. The colourless feature and more positive Ru(iii)/Ru(ii) redox potential of CdRu-PW than that of water oxidation suggest that CdRu-PW is a promising hole mediator for solar water splitting.

TI Magnetic-field induced multi-step transitions in ferromagnetic
   spin-crossover solids within the BEG model
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
AB We study by means of the 2D Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) spin-1 model, spin-crossover (SCO) and prussian blue analogs (PBAs) solids. In this model, the spin states, which can be high-spin (HS) or low-spin (LS), interact magnetically and elastically with their nearest neighbors. To account for the volume change, accompanying the spin transition phenomenon, all interactions through the lattice are assumed as temperature-dependent. In addition, the system is subject to a variable magnetic field lifting the degeneracy in the HS state. A stochastic cooperative dynamics of this BEG-like Hamiltonian, describing the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of ferromagnetic spin-crossover solids, is derived from the Glauber approach, with appropriate Arrhenius microscopic transition rates. The model generates under the magnetic field, sigmoidal relaxation and a hysteresis phenomenon of the HS fraction, as well as multistep behavior of the magnetization. These behaviors open the way to new route of multi-stable systems, desired in multi-byte electronics.

TI Multi-role heterogeneous Zn-Co double metal cyanide catalysts valid for

SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY
AB Double metal cyanides (DMCs) or Prussian blue analogs are well-known solid complexes, especially because of their gas and energy storage ability and catalytic activity for epoxide polymerization. The crystal structure, as well as the electron-donating complexing agent, has a crucial effect on the catalytic activity and selectivity of these materials. In this study, we developed a feasible process for fabricating Zn-Co DMC catalysts, which have a range of crystal structures, using organosilicon complexing agents. In addition, the transformation of the complexing agent during catalyst preparation was investigated using density functional theory calculations to understand the nature of the active sites. The resultant catalysts exhibited excellent activities, good selectivities, as well as a broad substrate scope, for the homopolymerization of epoxide and lactone (turnover frequency up to 564 min-1), copolymerization of epoxide with CO2 (up to 99 % yield), and hydrofunctionalization reactions of terminal alkynes (up to 95 % yield), which are among the most important applications of DMC catalysis.

TI Interfacial-engineered cobalt@carbon hybrids for synergistically boosted
   evolution of sulfate radicals toward green oxidation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Efficient water remediation relies on robust and capable catalysts to drive the cutting-edge purification technologies. In this work, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are engaged as the starting materials to fabricate various transition metal (TM)@carbon composites for water decontamination. The encapsulated metallic cobalt is unveiled to be more favorable to deliver electrons to the adjacent carbons than CoP and Co3O4, due to the low work function, high conductivity and formation of multiple Co-C bonds for electron tunnelling. Such a hybrid structure significantly tailors the electron density of the carbon lattice, which is the decisive factor influencing activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to generate highly reactive sulfate radicals for degradation of contaminants, meanwhile achieving outstanding long-term stability. Deliberate material design and theoretical computations unveil the structure-activity regimes of the composite materials in promoted carbocatalysis. This proof-of-concept study dedicates to elucidating the principles in developing fine-tuned and high-performance TM@carbon hybrids for advanced catalytic oxidation.

TI Ultrastable 1T-2H WS2 Heterostructures by Nanoarchitectonics
   of Phosphorus-Triggered Phase Transition for Hybrid Supercapacitors
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Tungsten disulfide (WS2) has recently emerged as a nontrivial material for electrochemical applications; however, boundaries associated with its 1T and 2H phases limit its performance. Here, this issue is addressed by evolving a dual-phase 1T-2H WS2 heterostructure that combines two different phases directly on the current collector. The resulting material demonstrated a 2D transformable phase structure, large interlayer distance, and highly exposed edge-active sites. Theoretical calculations confirmed that the 1T WS2 formed after phosphorus doping exhibits a semimetallic feature, elucidating a high electronic conductivity. The edge-enriched metallic phase and interlayer engineering of the 1T-2H WS2 heterostructure validate exceptional Na+ ion intercalation. The hybrid supercapacitor cell assembled with the 1T-2H WS2 anode and Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathode shows a specific energy of 65.5 Wh kg(-1) at 784 W kg(-1), and 95.7% cycling stability. This work paves a technique for phase transition and sheds light on the expansion of efficient energy storage devices.

TI In-Situ Activated NiFePBA-FeOOH Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution
   Reaction and Zinc-Air Battery
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB Developing low-price, highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still a significant challenge for metal-air batteries and electrochemical water splitting technology. Here, cost-effective OER catalyst composing of nickel-iron Prussian blue analogue and iron oxyhydroxide (NiFePBA-FeOOH) was successfully prepared by facile hydrothermal method. Designed NiFePBA-FeOOH catalyst exhibits superior OER performance with low overpotential, small Tafel slope and stable durability. Systematic investigations with in-situ Raman and Transmission electron microscope reveal that the as-prepared catalyst has undergone in-situ electrochemical transformation to generate real catalytic active species of nickel and iron oxyhydroxides. Particularly, the assembled zinc-air battery with NiFePBA-FeOOH catalyst also displays a long-term lifetime of 165 h only presenting a slight increase in voltage gap. Additionally, the successful exploration of cobalt-iron PBAs with iron oxyhydroxides further demonstrates the universality of PBAs-oxyhydroxides composites for energy storage and conversion applications.

TI Transforming a Diamagnetic Ordered Mesoporous Silica Monolith into a
   Room Temperature Permanent Magnet through Multiscale Control of the
   Magnetic Properties
SO CHEMNANOMAT
AB Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanoparticles confined in the ordered mesoporosity of silica monoliths with two-dimensional hexagonal structure are used as precursors and transformed into metal oxide or metal alloy by thermal treatment under oxidizing or reducing atmosphere. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show that, after appropriate thermal treatment, the ordered silica monoliths contain spherical nanocrystals of mixed oxide and metal alloy aligned along the cylindrical pore axis. Their size (4 nm) is controlled by the diameter of the cylindrical pores of the silica monolith and their aggregation state by the structure of the porosity and the synthesis route. Furthermore, the chemical composition of the starting PBA precisely determines that of the oxide or alloy nanocrystals. The magnetic properties of the monoliths, governed by strong interparticle interactions, are very sensitive to chemical composition, size and aggregation state of the nanoparticles. The multi-scale control of the nanocomposite enables producing a light macroscopic permanent magnet, which is attracted to a NdBFe magnet at room temperature.

TI The configuration of BiFe-PBA derived Bi2O3/BiFeO3 rectangular nanorods
   and NiCo-LDH/rGO for high-performance asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor
   with high energy density
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB The rectangular nanorods microstructure with abundant pores can reduce structural damage caused by the volume contraction during charging-discharging processes and enhance the specific capacitance. In this work, to enhance the energy density and accelerate the marketable applications of supercapacitors, Bi2O3/BiFeO3 rectangular nanorods with rich mesoporous structure derived from the iron-bismuth based Prussian blue analogue are rationally designed to achieve a large specific capacitance through precipitation and annealing measures. There are a huge specific capacity of 741 F g-1 and long cycle life. The NiCo-LDH/rGO (954 F g-1) demonstrated an impressive stability of 86 % after 10,000 cycles and is utilized to establish asymmetric supercapacitor device. Amazingly, the NiCo-LDH/rGO//Bi2O3/BiFeO3 device achieves an enormous energy density of 59.7 Wh kg- 1 at 800 W kg- 1. In addition, the capacity retention ratio is 79.3 % after 7000 cycles. The work has suggested that Bi2O3/BiFeO3 has great potential as a negative electrode of supercapacitors.

TI Rational design of hierarchical FeSe2 encapsulated with
   bifunctional carbon cuboids as an advanced anode for sodium-ion
   batteries
SO NANOSCALE
AB Earth-abundant transition-metal selenides (TMSs) have aroused great interest towards their application in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present Fe-based Prussian blue analogs (PBA) modified by graphene oxide as precursors to synthesize FeSe2 nanoparticles within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) matrix and graphene layer (FeSe2/NC@G). The bifunctional carbon wrapped FeSe2/NC@G shows excellent sodium-storage performance with a large reversible capacity of 331 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1) and a high cyclability of 323 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 2.0 A g(-1) after 1000 cycles (82% capacity retention). Furthermore, full SIBs are also fabricated and exhibit superior capacities and stabilities. The remarkable electrochemical properties result from the formation of an Fe-O-C chemical bond in the composite with enhanced electronic/ionic diffusion kinetics and structural integrity. This study paves the way for the successful synthesis of novel nanostructural TMSs which can be utilized in energy storage system application.

TI Revealing the Impact of Oxygen Dissolved in Electrolytes on Aqueous
   Zinc-Ion Batteries
SO ISCIENCE
AB Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising low-cost and high-safety energy storage devices. However, their capacity decay especially at the initial cyclic stage is a serious issue. Herein, we reveal that the dissolved oxygen in aqueous electrolyte has significant impact on the electrochemistry of Zn anode and ZIBs. After removing oxygen, the symmetrical set-up of Zn/Zn is capable of reversible plating/stripping with a 20-fold lifetime enhancement compared with that in oxygen enrichment condition. Taking aqueous Zn-MnO2 battery as an example, although the presence of oxygen can contribute an extra capacity over 20% at the initial cycles due to the electrocatalytic activity of MnO2 with oxygen, the corrosion of Zn anode can be eliminated in the oxygen-free circumstance and thus offering a better reversible energy storage system. The impact of the dissolved oxygen on the cycling stability also exists in other ZIBs using vanadium-based compounds, Birnessite and Prussian blue analog cathodes.

TI Stabilized ε-Fe2C catalyst with Mn tuning to suppress C1
   byproduct selectivity for high-temperature olefin synthesis
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Accurately controlling the product selectivity in syngas conversion, especially increasing the olefin selectivity while minimizing C1 byproducts, remains a significant challenge. Epsilon Fe2C is deemed a promising candidate catalyst due to its inherently low CO2 selectivity, but its use is hindered by its poor high-temperature stability. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of highly stable epsilon-Fe2C through a N-induced strategy utilizing pyrolysis of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). This catalyst, with precisely controlled Mn promoter, not only achieved an olefin selectivity of up to 70.2% but also minimized the selectivity of C1 byproducts to 19.0%, including 11.9% CO2 and 7.1% CH4. The superior performance of our epsilon-Fe2C-xMn catalysts, particularly in minimizing CO2 formation, is largely attributed to the interface of dispersed MnO cluster and epsilon-Fe2C, which crucially limits CO to CO2 conversion. Here, we enhance the carbon efficiency and economic viability of the olefin production process while maintaining high catalytic activity.

In this contribution, Fe/Co co-doped NiS with N-based carbon (FeCo-NiS@NC) derived from trimetallic Prussian blue analogue is designed and synthesized. The composition can be easily adjusted and modulated by multi-metals. In addition, the well-designed carbon nanocubes effectively promote electronic conductivity and buffer the volume change upon charge and discharge cycling, resulting in good capacity and long-term cycle life for both lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries, with capacities of 1018 mAh g-1 (vs. Li/Li+) and 454 mAh g-1 (vs. Na/Na+), respectively, after 100 cycles.

TI Recent advancements in hexacyanoferrate-based electrode materials for
   supercapacitor applications: A comprehensive review
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB The increasing global demand for efficient, durable, and cost-effective energy storage solutions presents a significant challenge, particularly in the context of sustainable energy systems. A critical problem in this domain is the need for electrode materials that can deliver high performance while being scalable for industrial applications. This review addresses this challenge by focusing on the recent advancements in hexacyanoferrate-based materials, specifically for supercapacitor (SC) applications. Hexacyanoferrates (HCFs), including Prussian Blue (PB) and its analogs, are recognized for their distinctive three-dimensional frameworks and favorable redox properties, making them promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the latest research on the synthesis, structural modifications, and electrochemical performance of HCF materials, emphasizing their role in enhancing specific capacitance, specific energy, and cyclic durability. Key advancements, such as the development of transition metal HCFs and their derivatives, are highlighted for their superior electrochemical properties. Additionally, we examine the integration of HCFs with polymers, conducting polymers, and carbon-based materials to create composites that further improve supercapacitor performance. The review also critically evaluates the challenges associated with scaling up HCF-based SCs from laboratory research to commercial manufacturing. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying gaps in the existing research, this review proposes future directions aimed at overcoming these challenges. Ultimately, this comprehensive overview underscores the potential of HCF-based SCs to contribute significantly to the advancement of sustainable energy storage technologies.

TI Intramolecular Electron Transfers in a Series of
   [Co2Fe2] Tetranuclear Complexes
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Discrete cyanide-bridged Co-Fe multinuclear complexes can be considered as functional units of bulk Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues, and they have been recognized as a new class of switching molecules in the last decade. The switching property of the cyanide-bridged Co-Fe complexes is based on intramolecular electron transfers between Co and Fe ions, and we herein refer to this phenomenon as an electron transfer-coupled spin transition (ETCST). Although there have been numerous reports on the complexes exhibiting ETCST behavior, the systematic study of the substituent effects on the thermal ETCST equilibrium in solution has not been reported yet, and the rational control of the equilibrium temperature remains challenging. We report here the syntheses and thermal ETCST behavior both in the solid state and solution for a series of tetranuclear [Co2Fe2] complexes, [Co2Fe2(CN)(6)(L1)(2)(L2)(4)]X-2 (LI and L2: tri- and bidentate capping ligands for Fe and Co ions, X: counteranions). All complexes showed thermal ETCST equilibrium between high-spin ([(hs-Co-II)(2)(ls-Fe-III)(2)) and low-spin ([(ls-Co-III)(2)(ls-Fe-II)(2)]) states in butyronitrile, and the equilibrium temperatures (T-1/2) showed systematic shifts by chemical modifications and chemical stimuli. The T-1/2 values were correlated with the redox potential differences (Delta E) of the Fe and Co ions in the constituent units, and the larger Delta E values led to the lower T-1/2. The present result suggests that the thermal ETCST behavior in solution can be rationally designed by considering the redox potentials of the constituent molecules.

TI CoFeP/NC@CoP/Ni2P heterostructure for efficient overall water
   splitting
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Rational design and construction of low-cost overall water splitting catalysts with high efficiency is of great significance to the green chemistry industry. Herein, a CoFeP/NC@CoP/Ni2P heterostructure is constructed via phosphiding CoFe-Prussian blue analogue@NiCo-precursor (CoFe-PBA@NiCo-Pre). This novel synthesis strategy can be used to prepare heterostructures, which significantly promote charge transfer due to a moderately regulated electronic structure and a strongly coupled heterointerface for electrocatalysis. Notably, the as-prepared CoFeP/NC@CoP/Ni2P heterostructure catalyst shows outstanding performances with small overpotentials of 256 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and 177 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Besides, when CoFeP/NC@CoP/Ni2P is used as anode and cathode catalysts, the cell voltage is only 1.66 V at 50 mA cm(-2). This work provides a novel perspective for the design and construction of heterostructure electrocatalysts for water splitting.

AB Dynamical properties of Prussian blue analogs and spin-crossover materials are investigated in the framework of a Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) spin-1 model, where states +/- 1 and 0 represent the high-spin (HS) state and the low-spin state, respectively. The quadrupolar interaction depends on the temperature in the form . Magnetic interactions are controlled by a factor such that for (), magnetic ordering is not expected. The model is exactly solved using the Bethe lattice approach for the equilibrium properties. The results are closer to those calculated by numerical simulations with suitable Arrhenius-type transition rates. The study of relaxation processes of non-equilibrium HS states revealed one-step nonlinear sigmoidal relaxation curves of the HS fraction at low temperatures. We found that increasing the magnetic interactions leads to the appearance of a plateau in the thermal hysteresis as well as in the relaxation curves of the HS fraction at low temperature.

TI Core-shell structure Co-Ni@Fe-Cu doped MOF-GR composites for water
   splitting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB What is essential to solving energy scarcity problems is that develop the high activity, durable and non-noble metal-based dual-functional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). In this work, a series of coreshell structure M@Fe-Cu-GR nanocubes (NCs) are prepared. In the prepared process, the bimetallic FeCu prussian blue analogues (PBA) is used as precursor, transition metals ions Co2+ and Ni2+ are introduced into the FeCu-PBA using the exchange of potassium ions with other metal ions, and then the FeCu-PBA are successfully loaded on the graphene oxide (GO) employed the attraction of opposite charges between polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and GO. Electrochemical tests show that the Tafel slope of Co-Ni@Fe-Cu -GR NCs for HER and OER are 60 and 82 mV dec-1, respectively, and Co-Ni@Fe-Cu-GR NCs shows excellent performance in long-term stability test.

TI Halide-Mediated Phase Control of
   FexCo1-xC y 
   Nanoparticles
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB The ability to control the compositional phase in first row transition metal bimetallic carbides as well as systematically controlling the metal ratio is complicated by the rich phase diagram, differences in metal reactivity, and differences in carbon solubility in the first-row metal carbides. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been shown to act as a single source precursor for the formation of nanocrystal metal carbides with maintenance of their metal. An investigation of crystal phase control in the ternary (FexCo1-x)(y)C-z formed by PBA collapse is yet to be explored. In this study, we demonstrate the ability to tune phase (from most carbon rich to least carbon rich) M2C, M5C2, M7C3, and M3C, as well as the bimetallic alloy (M) in bimetallic FeCo nanocarbides through a strategy that pairs synthetic and density functional theory approaches to enable future targeted structure-function research on intriguing catalytic, therapeutic, and magnetic applications.

TI Amorphous Cobalt Phosphate Porous Braced-Frame Nanocubes as Highly
   Efficient Supercapacitor Electrodes
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB It is extremely urgent to develop novel electrode materials with large capacity, high charge-discharge speed, and cycle stability for the particular application of supercapacitors in electric vehicles. Cobalt-based phosphate materials have attracted increasing attention due to their outstanding properties. Herein, cobalt phosphate with a braced-frame nanocube morphology consisting of amorphous nanoparticles is synthesized through a one-step ion-exchange method using Prussian Blue Analog Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes as precursors. Benefiting from the special nanostructure, this material shows a specific capacitance of up to 539.2 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, a capacitance retention of 92% even at 8 A g-1, and remarkable cycle stability characteristics, with a capacity preservation of 89.1% after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at 2 A g-1. The kinetic mechanism demonstrates that the diffusion-controlled procedure has made a great contribution to the large capacitance. This study will be helpful for the development of new electrode materials for supercapacitors.

TI Formation of Nickel Sulfide Nanoframes from Metal-Organic Frameworks
   with Enhanced Pseudocapacitive and Electrocatalytic Properties
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Nanoframe-like hollow structures with unique threedimensional (3D) open architecture hold great promise for various applications. Current research efforts mainly focus on frame-like noble metals and metal oxides. However, metal sulfides with frame-like nanostructures have been rarely reported. Starting from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), we demonstrate a novel structure-induced anisotropic chemical etching/anion exchange method to transform Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes into NiS nanoframes with tunable size. The reaction between Ni-Co PBA nanocube templates and Na2S in solution leads to the formation of welldefined NiS nanoframes. The different reactivity between the edges and the plane surface of the Ni-Co PBA nanocubes is found to be the key factor for the formation of NiS nanoframes. Benefitting from their structural merits including 3D open structure, small size of primary nanoparticles, high specific surface area, and good structural robustness, the as-derived NiS nanoframes manifest excellent electrochemical performance for electrochemical capacitors and hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte.

TI Weak Ferromagnetic Interaction at the Surface of the Ferrimagnetic
   Rb2Co4[Fe(CN)6]3.3•11H2
   O Photoexcited State
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB CoFe Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are wellknown for their magnetic bistability tuned by external stimuli. The photoswitching properties are due to the electron transfer from Co-LS(III)-NC-Fe-LS(II) to Co-HS(II)-NC-Fe-LS(III) linkage, accompanied by the spin change of the Co ions (HS stands for high spin and LS for low spin). In this work, we investigated 100 nm particles of the Rb2Co4[Fe(CN)(6)](3.3)center dot 11H(2)O PBA (named RbCoFe). The photoexcited state of the PBA was reached by red laser excitation (lambda = 635 nm) and observed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) that are element-specific probes. The XMCD measurements at the Co and Fe L-2,L-3 edges, probing the magnetic 3d orbitals, have provided a direct evidence of the antiferromagnetic interaction between the Co-HS(II) and the Fe-LS(III) ions belonging to the core of the particles, thus confirming the previously published, though indirect XMCD measurements at K edges. Because of the surface sensitivity of XMCD at the L-2,L-3 edges, the magnetic properties of the particle surface were also revealed. Surface Co-HS(II)-Fe-LS (III) pairs exhibit a weak ferromagnetic interaction. Thus, the magnetic structure of the photomagnetic RbCoFe 100 nm particles can be described as a ferrimagnetic core surrounded by a ferromagnetic shell. This finding brings new insights into the understanding of the complex magnetic properties of photoexcited RbCoFe and shows that the surface can have different magnetic behavior than the core. This should impact the nature of magnetic coupling in nanoparticles of CoFe PBA, where surface effect will dominate.

TI Spontaneous Oxidation of Organic Matter and Ammonium Uptake from Manure
   Wastewater by Redox-Active Materials
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Spontaneous NH4+ uptake using solid-state redox-active materials, driven by the oxidation of organic matter in manure wastewater, provides a sustainable and energy-friendly method for nutrient recovery. However, the mechanisms of electron transfer and accompanying ion transport are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the electron transfer pathway and NH4+ uptake mechanism by analyzing the composition changes in manure wastewater via NMR and the corresponding electrochemical results. We found that the spontaneous NH4+ uptake involves a direct electron transfer process without redox mediators, with the co-occurrence of ion intercalation and adsorption. Based on the elucidated mechanisms, a core-shell Prussian blue analogue redox material with improved stability in manure wastewater and enhanced NH4+ recovery compared to previously reported electrode materials was developed. Such a fundamental understanding of the oxidation of organic compounds and spontaneous NH4+ uptake by redox-active materials can guide the design of redox materials for effective resource recovery and environmental applications.

TI Understanding the formation of a cubic Mn0.6Fe0.4S
   solid-solution anode and its high performance for rechargeable
   lithium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A cubic Mn0.6Fe0.4S solid solution material has been synthesized using a scalable in situ sulfuration treatment of Prussian-blue analogs (PBAs), and its phase formation process and Li-storage mechanism were investigated. Increased treatment temperature and time encourage a phase transformation from hexagonal Fe7S8 to cubic FeS2 during the sulfuration process, which results in the formation of a solid solution between cubic FeS2 and cubic MnS. The resulting Mn0.6Fe0.4S solid solution electrode exhibits high initial coulombic efficiency, excellent rate performance, and superior cycling stability (520 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1)). Ex-situ X-ray diffractometry and electro-kinetics tests show that the doping-induced structural phase transition in Mn0.6Fe0.4S solid solution creates a favorable electronic structure and ensures rapid charge transfer kinetics during the lithiation/delithiation process, simultaneously achieving high energy conversion efficiency and a long lifespan.

SO COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Efficient and cost-effective electrode materials with multifunction are desirably demanded for energy conversion and storage cells. Herein, mixed metal phosphide of NiFeP is synthesized via low-temperature phosphorization method using NiFe Prussian blue analogues nanocubes as precursor. The nanoparticles assembled cubic structure supplies high contact surface area for electrochemical reactions and short path for fast charge transfer. The dual metals provide synergism for catalysis and energy storage, including improved intrinsic activity, increased active sites, and enhanced kinetics. NiFeP demonstrates efficient and stable catalysis activity for hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving low overpotential of 82 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) . When served as supercapacitor electrode, NiFeP exhibits high specific capacity (537.1 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and good cyclic stability (retaining 91.3% of the initial capacity after 5000 cycles at 1 A g(-1)). These findings may promote the development of transition metal phosphides based electrode materials for energy conversion and storage.

TI Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Fe/Co-based Bifunctional Electrode for
   H2 Production through Water and Urea Electrolysis
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Hollow-structured FexCo2-xP, FexCo3-xO4, and Prussian blue analogue (FeCo-PBA) microbuilding arrays on Ni foam (NF) are derived from Co-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOF) using a simple room temperature and post-heat-treatment route. Among them, FexCo2-xP/NF shows excellent bifunctional catalytic activities by demonstrating very low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials of 255/114mV at a current density of 20/10mAcm(-2) respectively, whereas FexCo3-xO4/NF and FeCo-PBA/NF demand higher overpotentials. Remarkably, for water electrolysis, FexCo2-xP/NF requires only 1.61V to obtain 10mAcm(-2). In contrast to water electrolysis, urea electrolysis reduces overpotential and simultaneously purifies the urea-rich wastewater. The urea oxidation reaction at the FexCo2-xP/NF anode needs just 1.345V to achieve 20mAcm(-2), which is 140mV less than the 1.48V potential required for OER. Moreover, the generation of H-2 through urea electrolysis needs only 1.42V to drive 10mAcm(-2).

TI Structural and Electrochemical Identification of CoFe Pnictide Catalysts
   Affecting the Performance of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The advance of efficient electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting is highly significant for the energy conversion system, but is hindered by the high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by four-electron transfer. Herein, we report a variation of transition metal compound based on the Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursor. CoP/FeP, Co2N/Fe3N, and CoFe catalysts are synthesized in N-2 atmosphere by phosphorization, nitridation, and calcination, respectively. After phosphorization, the synthesized mesoporous CoP/FeP nanocubes contribute to the improvement of the electrocatalyst performance by maintaining the shape of the precursor. The mesoporous structure of the CoP/FeP catalyst enhanced the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) than other Co2N/Fe3N and CoFe catalysts, resulting in better OER performance with an overpotential of 279 mV at a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 74 mV center dot dec(-1), and good stability for 24 h with only 5.64% degradation in alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH).

TI A scalable molecule-based magnetic thin film for spin-thermoelectric
   energy conversion
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin thermoelectrics, an emerging thermoelectric technology, offers energy harvesting from waste heat with potential advantages of scalability and energy conversion efficiency, thanks to orthogonal paths for heat and charge flow. However, magnetic insulators previously used for spin thermoelectrics pose challenges for scale-up due to high temperature processing and difficulty in large-area deposition. Here, we introduce a molecule-based magnetic film for spin thermoelectric applications because it entails versatile synthetic routes in addition to weak spin-lattice interaction and low thermal conductivity. Thin films of Cr-II[Cr-III(CN)(6)], Prussian blue analogue, electrochemically deposited on Cr electrodes at room temperature show effective spin thermoelectricity. Moreover, the ferromagnetic resonance studies exhibit an extremely low Gilbert damping constant -(2.4 +/- 0.67) x10(-4), indicating low loss of heat-generated magnons. The demonstrated STE applications of a new class of magnet will pave the way for versatile recycling of ubiquitous waste heat.

TI Hollow FeCo-FeCoP@C nanocubes embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon

SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Designing readily available and highly active electrocatalysts for water splitting is essential for renewable energy technologies. Here we present the construction of FeCo-FeCoP@C hollow nanocubes encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (FeCo-FeCoP@C@NCCs) through controlled carbonization and subsequent phosphorization of a Prussian blue analogue. With stronger electronic interaction and hollow structure, the as-obtained FeCo-FeCoP@C@NCCs material requires small overpotentials of 91 mV and 280 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH toward hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively. More importantly, applying this material for overall water splitting, it only requires 1.64 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits impressively durability over 40 h without obvious performance decay. The present approach inspires potentials for the controllable synthesis of multi-component catalysts for practical applications.

This work focuses on the improvement of electronic conductivity and cycle stability of metal oxides. The nanocubes of Prussian blue analogues are firstly encapsulated in the network of graphene aerogel (GA), and then the Co3O4@GA composites are synthesized after the subsequent calcination treatment.

The extraordinary lithium-storage performances can be ascribed to the synergistic interaction between metal oxides and GA substrate. The incorporation of GA improves the electrode conductivity and alleviates the aggregation and volume expansion of metal oxide particles upon cycling, whereas cobalt oxides contribute a high specific capacity.

TI Advances in Electrode Materials for Aqueous Rechargeable Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA
AB With solar, wind, and other types of renewable energy incorporated into electrical grids and with the construction of smart grids, energy storage technology has become essential to optimize energy utilization. Due primarily to its abundance and low cost, aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (ARSBs) have received increasing attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage technology, and represent a promising alternative to energy storage in future power grids. However, because of the limitations of the thermodynamics of electrochemical processes in water, reactions in aqueous solution are more complicated compared to an organic system. Many parameters must be taken into account in an aqueous system, such as electrolyte concentration, dissolved oxygen content, and pH. As a result, it is challenging to select an appropriate electrode material, whose capacity, electrochemical potential, adaptability, and even catalytic effect may seriously affect the battery performance and hamper its application. Therefore, the development of advanced electrode materials, which can suppress side reactions of the battery and have good electrochemical performance, has become the focus of ARSB research. This paper briefly discusses the characteristics of ARSBs and summarizes the latest research progress in the development of electrode materials, including oxides, polyanionic compounds, Prussian blue analogues, and organics. This review also discusses the challenges remaining in the development of ARSBs, and suggests several ways to solve them, such as by using multivalent ions, hybridized electrolytes, etc., and speculates about future research directions. The studies and concepts discussed herein will advance the development of ARSBs and promote the optimization of energy utilization.

TI Ultrathin carbon boosted sodium storage performance in aqueous
   electrolyte
SO FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS LETTERS
AB The sodium-based aqueous energy storage devices possess the advantages of low cost, high safety and wide application. However, the low energy density of traditional carbon-based sodium storage materials limits their large-scale application. Besides, other sodium storage materials, such as transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), cannot achieve high capacity and stable energy storage performance due to their poor conductivity and instability. Ultrathin carbon with unique characteristics, such as high electrical conductivity, excellent chemical stability, can compensate for the shortcomings of these sodium storage materials. Besides, the arising synergistic effect among ultrathin carbon and active materials is capable of further boosting the performance to achieve robust microstructure, stable electrode/electrolyte interface, high reaction kinetics for obtained composite electrode. This paper summarizes the recently developed strategies to incorporate ultrathin carbon with electrode materials, followed by a discussion of the important role of ultrathin carbon in enhancing sodium storage properties, as well as the future research direction.

SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Electrochemical energy storage devices will definitely play a vital role in the future energy landscape of the world. The innovation of electrode materials is a key task for the breakthrough of present bottleneck faced by electrochemical energy storage devices. Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) are gaining rapid attention, and they offer tremendous opportunities to explore the low-cost, safe, and next-generation green batteries for large-scale stationary storage applications. In this review, the authors aim to give a comprehensive overview and summary of the recent progresses in cathode materials for AZIBs. Broadly, the authors classify the cathode materials for AZIBs into four groups: manganese-based cathodes, vanadium-based cathodes, Prussian blue analogs, and organic compounds. The reaction mechanisms, zinc storage properties, and several optimizing strategies of these cathode materials are summarized. Comparative observations of the main cathode families are discussed. Moreover, the emerging challenges and future research perspectives of cathode materials for AZIBs are proposed.

TI MOF-derived self-assembled ZnO/Co3O4 nanocomposite
   clusters as high-performance anodes for lithium-ion batteries
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Although different kinds of metal oxide nanoparticles are extensively investigated as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), their cycle life and energy/power density are still not suitable for commercial applications. Metal oxides have a large storage capacity, but they suffer from low electrical conductivity and severe volume change during the charge/discharge process. Herein, we present a facile route to prepare self-assembled ZnO/Co3O4 nanocomposite clusters through calcination of preformed Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA) Zn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanospheres. These self-assembled ZnO/Co3O4 nanocomposite clusters exhibit superior lithium storage capabilities with good cycling properties. A reversible capacity of 957 mA h g(-1) was retained at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) up to 100 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the ZnO/Co3O4 nanocomposite anode can be ascribed to the rational design of the self-assembled cluster structures and the synergetic effect of two-component functional nanoparticle systems.

TI MXene- mediated reconfiguration induces robust nickel-iron catalysts for
   industrial- grade water oxidation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Nickel-iron oxy/hydroxides (NiFeOxHy) emerge as an attractive type of electrocatalysts for alkaline water oxidation reaction (WOR), but which encounter a huge challenge in stability, especially at industrial - grade large current density due to uncontrollable Fe leakage. Here, we tailor the Fe coordination by a MXene- mediated reconfiguration strategy for the resultant NiFeOxHy catalyst to alleviate Fe leakage and thus reinforce the WOR stability. The introduction of ultrafine MXene with surface dangling bonds in the electrochemical reconfiguration over Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogue induces the covalent hybridization of NiFeOxHy/MXene, which not only accelerates WOR kinetics but also improves Fe oxidation resistance against segregation. As a result, the NiFeOxHy coupled with MXene exhibits an extraordinary durability at ampere - level current density over 1,000 h for alkaline WOR with an ultralow overpotential of only 307 mV. This work provides a broad avenue and mechanistic insights for the development of nickel-iron catalysts toward industrial applications.

TI Rocking-chair ammonium ion battery with high rate and long-cycle life
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB Aqueous rechargeable ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs) have drew considerable attention because of their capacity for high rates, low cost, and high safety. However, developing desired electrodes requiring stable structure in the aqueous fast ammoniation/de-ammoniation becomes urgent. Herein, an ammonium ion full battery using Cu 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 2 (CuHCF) acting to be a cathode and barium vanadate (BVO) acting to be an anode is described. Its excellent electrochemical behavior of Prussian blue analogs and the perfectly matched lattice structure of NH 4 + is expected. And the open structure of vanadium compounds satisfies the fast ammoniation/de-ammoniation of NH 4 + is also achieved. As a result of these synergistic effects, the BVO//CuHCF full cell retains 80.5 percent of its capacity following 10 0 0 cycling. These achievements provide new ideas for developing low-cost and long-life AIBs.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

TI S-doping Fe-Ce composites derived from PBA to accelerate Fe(III)/Fe(II)
   cycle in the Fenton-like process
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO
AB The design of metal-organic framework-derived metal oxides/sulfides is an effective approach for water remediation. A series of Fe-Ce composites (Fe-Ce-S-N) with cluster-like morphology were prepared with prussian blue analogue (PBA) as the precursor in a hydrothermal process. S doping promoted the conversion of Fe(iii) to Fe(ii), which greatly improved the performance of the Fenton-like reaction. The optimized Fe-Ce-S-N catalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity towards sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) degradation (18.63 mgSMZ gcat(-1) min(-1)), showing the largest k value (0.1862 min(-1)), which was 2.1 and 8.1 times higher than that of Fe-Ce-S-H and Fe-Ce-N, respectively. Moreover, the Fe-Ce-S-N catalyst displayed a remarkable reusability, stability and adaptability in Fenton-like systems. Overall, this work provides new insights into extending novel PBA-derived catalysts to significantly improve heterogeneous Fenton-like performances.

TI Large-Scale Synthesis of Multifunctional Single-Phase Co2C
   Nanomaterials
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Achieving scalable synthesis of nanoscale transition-metal carbides (TMCs), regarded as substitutes for platinum-group noble metals, remains an ongoing challenge. Herein, a 100-g scale synthesis of single-phased cobalt carbide (Co2C) through carburization of Co-based Prussian Blue Analog (Co-PBA) is reported in CO2/H-2 atmosphere under mild conditions (230 degrees C, ambient pressure). Textural property investigations indicate a successful preparation of orthorhombic-phased Co2C nanomaterials with Pt-group-like electronic properties. As a demonstration, Co2C achieves landmark photo-assisted thermal catalytic CO2 conversion rates with photo-switched product selectivity, which far exceeds the representative Pt-group-metal-based catalysts. This impressive result is attributed to the excellent activation of reactants, colorific light absorption, and photo-to-thermal conversion capacities. In addition to CO2 hydrogenation, the versatile Co2C materials show huge prospects in antibacterial therapy, interfacial water evaporation, electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction, and battery technologies. This study paves the way toward unlocking the potential of multi-functional Co2C nanomaterials.

TI Pomegranate-like microclusters organized by ultrafine Co
   nanoparticles@nitrogen-doped carbon subunits as sulfur hosts for
   long-life lithium-sulfur batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB For further development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, it is necessary to construct sulfur hosts with high sulfur utilization/loading ratios and moderate the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides. Herein, we synthesized uniform pomegranate-like microclusters (MCs) via carbonization of a Prussian blue analogue; the MCs consist of homogeneously inlaid ultrafine Co nanoparticles in nitrogen-doped carbon subunits (Co-NPC). The hierarchical pore structure and high conductivity of the Co-NPC-MCs can immobilize sulfur species, and the ultrafine Co nanoparticles and doped nitrogen exert catalytic effects to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. Therefore, the S/Co-NPC-MCs cathode exhibits a high initial capacity of 1192 mA h g(-1) and 941 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C. It also exhibits excellent rate capacities at high rates of 1C and 2C; the reversible capacities remain at 650 mA h g(-1) and 574 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles, respectively, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications.

TI PBA-MoS2 nanoboxes with enhanced peroxidase activity for
   constructing a colorimetric sensor array for reducing substances
   containing the catechol structure
SO ANALYST
AB Some nanoperoxidase-based colorimetric sensors have been used to detect only one molecule at a time. Thus, the simultaneous detection of various molecules coexisting in the same system is a great challenge. In this work, an excellent nanoperoxidase, nickel cobalt Prussian blue analogue-MoS2 nanoboxes (PBA-MoS2), have been successfully prepared by the hydrothermal method and used to construct a colorimetric sensing array to determine a series of reductive substances containing the catechol structure (such as catechol, epinephrine hydrochloride, procyanidin, caffeic acid and dopamine hydrochloride). The excellent peroxidase-like activity of PBA-MoS2 is verified by the chromogenic reaction of 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2 in 2 min. The catalytic mechanism of PBA-MoS2 is attributed to generated reactive species including holes (h(+)) and superoxide radicals (O-2(-)) in the process of catalysis. The fast economic H2O2 colorimetric sensing array has been constructed based on the PBA-MoS2 nanoperoxidase. Due to the presence of different reducing substances, the catalytic oxidation of TMB can be restricted to different extents, accompanied by blue colour changes to varying degrees. Therefore, on combining PBA-MoS2 nanoperoxidase with H2O2 and TMB, five reductive substances can be quantitatively distinguished by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) at the 2 mM level.

TI Achieved RGBY Four Colors Changeable Electrochromic Pixel by
   Coelectrodeposition of Iron Hexacyanoferrate and Molybdate
   Hexacyanoferrate
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Although multicolor electrochromic materials and devices have been studied by many researchers, there is still none an inorganic single-layer film that has red, blue, and green three typical color states, while red, green, and blue (RGB) are indispensably for multicolor display. Iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) is a kind of well-studied inorganic electrochromic material with relatively colorful properties and a great family of analogues. In this Research Article, the RGBY film with red, green, blue and yellow four typical color states are obtained successfully by coelectrodeposition of FeHCF and molybdate hexacyanoferrate (MoOHCF). This film contains the electrochromic properties of both components. Moreover, benefiting from its high A(+) (alkali cation ions that can insert/extract into/from the framework, such as Li+ and K+) content, the redox process of RGBY film can be fully completed to achieve rich color variation. The absorptivity adjustment range of RGBY film at 730 and 440 nm are 0.81 and 0.43, respectively. The response time of RGBY films varies from 3 to 30 s between states and maintains its optical properties without significant decay during 1000 cycles. Finally, a pixelated electrode and a facile electrochromic device based on RGBY film have been developed to exhibit its high application potential in nonemission display field.

TI The development of a rapid monitoring method for radiocesium in seawater
   in the Fukushima region
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB Very recently, we reported the preparation of several types of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanoparticle (NP) slurries with varying compositions (KCuHCF-NPs, A(y)Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](1-x)center dot zH(2)O) and different NP sizes via systematically tuning the synthetic conditions using a Y-type micro-mixer at a high flow rate of 200 mL min(-1) for the recovery of cesium (Cs) from seawater in the presence of competing ions [Environ. Sci.: Water Res. Technol., 2019, 5, 1328-1338]. Here, we report a new monitoring method for the rapid assessment of low levels of radioactive Cs (137-Cs) and its effective concentration and quantification in Fukushima seawater, directly using KCuHCF-0.26 NPs (K1.02Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](0.74)center dot 2.63H(2)O) slurry ink. Laboratory test measurements of stable 133-Cs using KCuHCF-0.26 in simulated seawater showed Cs recovery exceeding 99.5% within 30 min. A pilot large-scale experiment conducted in conditioned seawater (100 L tank) with 137-Cs and 133-Cs (500 mu g L-1) using KCuHCF-0.26 slurry at Tokyo Power Technology Ltd (TPT), Japan, agreed with the laboratory results, exhibiting high Cs recovery efficiencies over a wide pH range of 5-9. A high adsorbent to solution ratio of 10 000 mL g(-1) was applied to selectively adsorb Cs in the presence of competing coexisting ions in seawater, meaning most 137-Cs in 1000 L of solution could be concentrated into only 0.1 kg of KCuHCF-NPs; thus, much lower levels of radiation in seawater could be recovered. The proposed method shortened the preconcentration and pre-treatment times of 137-Cs to ca. 30 min in a 100 L conditioned seawater tank and a germanium detector (Ge-detector) container packed with flocculated KCuHCF-0.26 flocs. This study examines the effectiveness of this method involving mixing KCuHCF-0.26 slurry ink, with strong Cs-adsorption abilities, with seawater containing 137-Cs, including the addition of 133-Cs as an elution suppression measure.

TI Highly selective adsorption and lattice process of cesium by cubic
   cyanide-based functional materials
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Cesium (Cs) is a byproduct of nuclear bombs, nuclear weapons testing, and nuclear fission in nuclear reactors. Cs can enter the human body through food or air and cause lasting damage. Highly efficient and selective removal of Cs-137 from low-level radioactive effluents (LLREs), which contain many radionuclides and dissolved heavy metal species, is imperative for minimizing LLRE volume, and facilitating their final disposal. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have received much attention as materials for the removal of radioactive Cs because of their affinity for adsorbing Cs+. In this study, an inexpensive and readily available cyanide-based functional material (PBA(Cu)) exhibiting high efficiency and excellent selectivity toward Cs capture was designed through a facile low-temperature co-precipitation process. Nano-PBA(Cu), crystallizing in the cubic space group (Fm-3m (225)), has an average pore size of 6.53 nm; consequently, PBA(Cu) can offer abundant atomic occupation sites for capturing and incorporating Cs. Here, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model fitted well with the adsorption of Cs (+) on PBA(Cu), with a maximum capture capacity of 95.75 mg/g within 5 min, confirming that PBA(Cu) could rapidly capture Cs ions. PBA(Cu) strongly and selectively interacted with Cs even in a simulant containing large Na+, NH4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ion concentrations in an aqueous solution. The process of Cs (+) adsorption by cyanide-based functional crystals was confirmed to involve the entry of Cs+ into cyanide-based functional crystals to replace K+ and finally achieve the lattice incorporation of Cs. The current results broaden the lattice theory of radionuclide Cs removal and provide a promising alternative for the immobilization of Cs from radioactive wastewater.

TI Continuous capillary-flow sensing of glucose and lactate in sweat with
   an electrochemical sensor based on functionalized graphene oxide
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB We describe an electrochemical device for the simultaneous monitoring of glucose and lactate in sweat, based on enzymatic sensors exploiting capillary flow to induce continuous, stable sensing. The enzymes, namely glucose oxidase and lactate oxidase, were anchored to a graphene oxide and chitosan composite (GO-Ch) of original synthesis, to achieve stable deposition of the bioreceptors on the electrochemical platform. We tested both biosensors on a realistic device architecture: they were embedded in a nitrocellulose strip, to exploit capillary force to induce a continuous flux of sweat on the sensor platform, ensuring the constant renewal of sample. We could achieve good sensitivity at potentials close to zero by using Prussian Blue as redox mediator, thus avoiding interference from other chemical species present in the complex matrix. The sensing signal was stable and linear over two hours in a concentration range of glucose and lactate between the limit of quantification (32 and 68 nM, respectively) and the upper limit of linearity (3.8 and 50.0 mM, respectively). The device is simple, robust, stable, and can be easily worn without the direct contact of the active part with the skin, making it suitable for simultaneous monitoring of glucose and lactate in human sweat.

TI Rational design of hierarchical yolk-double shell Fe@NCNs/MnO2 via
   thermal-induced phase separation toward wideband microwave absorption
SO CARBON
AB Rational design of yolk-shell architectures with synergistic effect are vital for improving microwave attenuation ability, but still face challenges. In this work, we employ the thermal-induced phase separation engineering and redox strategy to fabricate hierarchical yolk-double shell Fe@NCNs/MnO2, in which magnetic Fe units are individually confined in N-doped carbon nanocubes (NCNs) cavity and hierarchical MnO2 nanosheets are inti-mately anchored on NCNs surface. It is found that the phase separation process between Prussian blue and poly-dopamine is significantly determined by the thermal-induced inward contraction owing to their different thermal stabilities and independent crystal structures. As results, the hierarchical composites exhibit matched impedance and wideband microwave absorption owing to the internal cavity architectures, multiple hetero-interfaces, dielectric-magnetic synergistic effect and hierarchical conformations. The minimum reflection loss reaches-46.7 dB with 3.3 mm thickness, and more importantly, the effective bandwidth (<-10 dB) achieves as strong as 10.8 GHz at 3.1 mm. This work opens up a novel and meaningful thinking for the construction of yolk-double shell architectures and the synthesized hierarchical composites can be used as promising candidates in addressing electromagnetic pollution.

TI Noninvasive Diabetes Monitoring through Continuous Analysis of Sweat
   Using Flow-Through Glucose Biosensor
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB We propose monitoring of diabetes through continuous analysis of undiluted sweat immediately after its excretion using a flow-through glucose biosensor. The used biosensors are based on Prussian Blue and glucose oxidase immobilized in perfluorosulfonated ionomer or gel of alkoxysilane; the resulting sensitivity with the latter reaches in batch mode 0.23 A M-1 cm(-2), and the calibration range is from 1 mu M to 1 mM (flow-through mode). On the basis of the glucose tolerance test known to be a clinically relevant procedure to mimic hyperglycemia, a positive correlation between the rates of glucose concentration increase in blood and in noninvasively collected sweat has been observed (r = 0.75). The observed correlation between sweat and blood considering low-molecular weight metabolites is even better than that observed previously between capillary and vein blood, confirming diagnostic value of sweat for diabetes monitoring. The dynamics of sweat glucose concentration, recorded by means of the proposed biosensor, is in a good accordance with the dynamics of blood glucose content without any time delay, thus offering a prospect for noninvasive monitoring of diabetes.

TI Dispersed Mn2Co2C nanoparticles in interconnected
   nitrogen-doped carbon framework as cathode catalysts for efficient and
   long-life Li-CO2 batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The Li-CO2 batteries are concerned as a potential energy conversion and storage system which can not only effectively capture CO2 gas but also offer a high energy density. Therefore, they can be widely used in CO2- enriched environments such as submarine operations. However, the development of Li-CO2 batteries is still restricted by the high polarization and poor cycle performance mainly due to the insulating discharge product, e. g., Li2CO3. Herein, the Mn2Co2C nanoparticles dispersed in interconnected nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks (Mn2Co2C@NC), obtained by pyrolyzing MnCo Prussian blue analogous (MnCo-PBA), are first utilized as the cathode materials in Li-CO2 batteries. The batteries deliver a high discharge capacity (18962 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)), the lowest overpotential (1.47 V), and the best cycle performance (330 cycles, close to 1800 h, with a limited capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1)). The good cycling stability under 200 mA g(-1) is more prominent for current Li-CO2 batteries. The superior performance of Mn2Co2C@NC is ascribed to abundant catalytic sites of Mn/Co-nitrogen-carbon (Mn/Co-NC) and nitrogen-doped carbon, which have outstanding adsorption and acti-vation effects on CO2. Meantime, the robust interconnected carbon framework provides fast electron/electrolyte transport paths and a large deposition space of Li2CO3. The density functional theory calculations reveal the strong adsorption of Li+ and CO2, strong catalytic performance for CO2 reduction, and excellent electrical conductivity of the Mn/Co-NC and nitrogen-doped carbon active sites. Finally, when combining a gel electrolyte, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time the fabricated quasi-solid-state Li-CO2 batteries demonstrate good cycling stability with high deliverable specific discharge capacity, highlighting its great potential for the ap-plications of flexible and wearable batteries.

TI Portable Hydrogel Kits Made with Bimetallic Nanozymes for Point-of-Care
   Testing of Perfluorooctanesulfonate
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), an emerging organic contaminant, necessitates robust on-site detection strategies to safeguard human health and ecological balance. This study introduces a novel point-of-care testing (POCT) platform, combining a hydrogel kit with nanozymes and smartphone technology, for the highly sensitive detection of PFOS. The strategy utilizes copper-substituted cobalt-based Prussian blue analogue nanoboxes (CuCo-PBA NBs), which exhibit intricate hollow structures and remarkable peroxidase-like catalytic activity, efficiently catalyzing the oxidation of chromogenic substrates with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Density functional theory calculations elucidate the adsorption dynamics of H2O2 on CuCo-PBA NBs, identifying the factors that improve the catalytic efficiency. The colorimetric POCT platform, integrating the hydrogel kit with a smartphone interface, demonstrates practical utility and achieves a detection limit of 1.43 x 10(-8) mol L-1 for PFOS. This research not only presents a new nanozyme design for PFOS detection in diverse matrices, such as lake water, whole blood, urine, and milk, but also paves the way for developing a portable and efficient POCT platform for a variety of emerging contaminants.

TI Antioxidants Recognition Colorimetric Sensor Array Based on Multicolor
   System
SO APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB A colorimetric sensor array with three identification signals has been developed to visually recognize five antioxidants based on CuFe Prussian blue analogs nanocubes (CuFe PBA NCs) and 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The CuFe PBA NCs can oxidize TMB to produce three ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption peaks at different wavelengths (370, 450, and 650 nm). Depending on the different reduction capacity of dopamine, cysteine, ascorbic acid, glutathione, and melatonin, the redox process can be inhibited to varying degrees, resulting in different changes in the signal generation of three identification elements. And in the presence of different antioxidants, the color of the solution also changes in different degrees. Five antioxidants (20 mu M) can be identified by this colorimetric sensor array, and the identification accuracy was 100% for 40 unknown antioxidants. In addition, these antioxidants can also be quantified based on the regression equation between the concentration of the antioxidants and the absorbance change. The correlation coefficient is greater than 0.990, and the detection limit is less than 3.5 mu M.

TI Pyrochlore@PBA derived electrocatalyst containing Ru nanoparticle and
   NiFe alloy for the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Developing enhanced electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for commercializing green energy technologies, such as Zn-air batteries. In this study, a uniquely designed metal catalyst-support material composite was synthesized using a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) and Y2Ru2O7 (YRO) pyrochlore for Zn-air battery. P-S-doped Ru nanoparticles and PBA-derived NiFe alloys anchored on the YRO pyrochlore (YRO@NiFe/Ru-PS) were synthesized in one pyrolysis process via in situ exsolution. The electronic structure of the Ru and NiFe particles was tailored by the pyrochlore support and P-S dual doping, which decreased the energy barrier for the catalytic reaction. YRO@NiFe/Ru-PS exhibited outstanding OER (overpotential = 241 mA/cm2; Tafel slope = 36 mV/dec) and ORR (half-wave potential = 0.83 V; Tafel slope = 65 mV/dec) performances. Furthermore, it also exhibited high performance in Zn-air battery applications (power density = 112 mW/cm2). This paper proposes an efficient and unique design strategy for developing OER/ORR bifunctional electrocatalysts.

TI Dual-metal M-N-C (M = Mn, Co) as an effective oxygen electrocatalyst for
   zinc-air battery
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Developing high-active and low-cost non-noble metal electrocatalysts is an efficient strategy for design of advanced rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB). Herein, an oxygen electrocatalyst of Prussian-blue-analogues derived MnCo dual-metal M-N-C (PBA-MnCo-N-C) is prepared using a carbonization method. The electrochemical tests show that, it owns good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performances with the onset potential of 0.966 V and half-wave potential of 0.859 V, almost approaching that of Pt/C catalysts. Simultaneously, a good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is also obtained, with a potential of 1.844 V at 10 mA cm-2. In the practical application, as-assembled ZAB with PBA-MnCo-N-C exhibits high open circuit potential (1.48 V) and peak power density (102.25 mW cm-2), and after continuous discharge and charge for more than 160 h, the PBAMnCo-N-C based ZAB manifests a favorable charge-discharge stability. This work provides a good reference of constructing bimetallic catalyst for high-efficiency oxygen electrocatalysis.

TI Hierarchical nitrogen-doped porous carbon incorporating cobalt
   nanocrystal sites for nitrophenol reduction
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB The direct pyrolysis of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently provided an effective method to prepare various metal-incorporated composite carbon materials. In this work, hierarchical Co-embedded N-doped porous carbon microspheres were synthesized by controlled pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn-Co Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), in which the metallic Zn component served as thermally removable template and ligand [Co(CN)(6)](3-) served as both Co and N sources. When devoted to catalyzing the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NPh) into 4-aminophenol (4-APh), the optimized catalyst exhibited a large apparent rate constant of 1.35 min(-1) and high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.0204 s(-1), which was superior to the majority of noble-metal-based catalysts. Besides, a home-made continuous flow catalysis system was readily constructed. Control experiments confirmed that both partially uncovered and totally inbuilt active metallic Co species acted as catalytically active sites. This work might provide a further understanding of the identification of active sites within metal-incorporated carbon-based catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Cathode materials for rechargeable zinc-ion batteries: From synthesis to
   mechanism and applications
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (RZIBs) are one of the most promising candidates to replace lithium-ion batteries and fulfill future electrical energy storage demands due to the characters of high environmental abundance, low cost and high capacities (820 mAh g(-1)/5855 mAh cm(-3)). Although some progresses have been made in enhancing the electrochemical performance of RZIBs, challenges of the lack of suitable cathodes to tolerate the stable insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions still remain. In this review, we mainly summarize the synthesis technology, composition, structure and electrochemical properties of various cathode materials of RZIBs as well as optimization of the electrolyte, which include manganese-based oxides, vanadium-based materials, Prussian blue analogues, Chevrel phases, polyanionic compounds, metal disulfides, organic compounds, aqueous electrolyte and nonaqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, their energy storage mechanisms are also discussed. Finally, challenges, further research directions and perspectives regarding the development of high performance cathodes are highlighted. This review will be beneficial for researchers to develop high performance RZIBs for meeting the demands of rapidly developing electric vehicles and portable electronic products.

TI Hollow structure engineering of FeCo alloy nanoparticles electrospun in

   zinc-air batteries
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Hollow-structuring of active components is among the most effective strategies for improving the kinetics of oxygen electrode catalysts, benefiting from the much-improved active surface area, enhanced accessible active sites, and formation of the desired defects on the exposed surface. Integration of active hollow nanostructures with functionalized carbon nanofibers synergizes the electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility, which are particularly of interest for all-solid-state zinc-air batteries (FASS ZABs). In the present work, we demonstrate that the electrospinning of Prussian blue analogs can give rise to hollow FeCo alloy nanoparticles assembled in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (h-FeCo alloy/N-CNFs). The h-FeCo alloy/N-CNFs thus derived exhibit superior bifunctional activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and impressive performance in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. When integrated into a rechargeable FASS ZAB, they exhibit a high open circuit voltage of 1.335 V and a stable discharge-charge plateau around 1.1 V to 2.0 V, together with a large voltage efficiency of 63.5%, under bending conditions.

TI Tailored manganese hexacyanoferrate/graphene oxide nanocomposites:
   one-pot facile synthesis and favorable capacitance behavior for
   supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB Prussian blue analogues have been widely investigated in the field of materials chemistry because of its low cost, high porosity, and excellent redox reversibility. Herein, a series of MnHCF/GO nanocomposites (MHG) with diverse GO contents have been successfully prepared at room temperature through a facile and cost-effective chemical precipitation method. It is indicated that MnHCF nanoparticles anchor on the surface of GO nanosheets, forming a well-coupled hybrid nanostructure. GO nanosheets can not only ameliorate the agglomeration of MnHCF nanoparticles, but also boost the electron/ion transport in the electrolyte. In addition, the synergistic effect between MnHCF nanoparticles and GO nanosheets can improve the electrochemical properties of MHG nanocomposites. MHG-3-based electrode with 20 wt% GO nanosheets exhibits a specific capacitance of 279.3 F g(-1), which is approximately three times higher than that of pristine MnHCF electrode at 0.3 A g(-1). Moreover, MHG-3-based electrode exhibits favorable cyclic stability (65.3% after 2000 continuous charge/discharge cycles at 0.8 A g(-1)).

TI MOF-derived strategy for monodisperse Cd0.5Zn0.5S
   nanospheres with enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have been widely applied as templates/precursors to synthesize porous materials for various applications. However, the MOF-derived solid solutions were scarcely reported. In this work, uniform monodisperse Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanospheres were fabricated via a facile solvothermal route using Cd-Zn-Fe Prussian blue analogs (Cd-Zn-Fe PBA) as the precursor. Compared with the Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoparticles prepared by the conventional method, the Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanospheres exhibited higher specific surface area, better charge transfer rate and stronger light absorption capacity, which led to higher photocatalytic activity. The H-2 evolution rate of the resultant Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanospheres was 4341.6 nmol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light irradiation, with a quantum efficiency of 4.5% at 420 nm. Besides, the Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanospheres also exhibited good stability during the photocatalytic reactions. The present work provides an idea for the preparation of uniform-sized solid solutions using MOFs as templates. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI ZnFe(PBA)@Ti3C2Tx nanohybrid-based
   highly sensitive non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor for the detection
   of glucose in human sweat
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The ZnFe prussian blue analogue [ZnFe(PBA)] was infused with Ti3C2Tx (MXene) denoted as ZnFe(PBA)@Ti3C2Tx and was prepared by an in-situ sonication method to use as a non-enzymatic screen printed electrode sensor. The advantage of non-enzymatic sensors is their excellent sensitivity, rapid detection, low cost and simple design. The synthesized ZnFe(PBA)@Ti3C2Tx was characterized for its physical and chemical characterization by XRD, Raman, XPS, EDAX, and FESEM analysis. It possessed multiple functionalized layers and a cubic structure in the nanohybrid. Further, the sensor was investigated by using electroanalytical studies such as cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry analysis. The enhanced surface area with a cubic structure of ZnFe(PBA) and the excellent electrical response of Ti3C2 nanosheet support the advancement of a non-enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensor with improved sensitivity of 973.42 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 3.036 mu M (S/N = 3) and linear detection range (LDR) from 0.01 to 1 mM.

TI Synergistic effect of NiCo alloy and NiCoS integrated with N doped
   carbon for superior rate and ultralong-lifespan lithium sulfur batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The transition-metal-based alloy and chalcogenides have been widely investigated as efficient sulfur host for lithium sulfur batteries (LSB), yet the synergistic effect of both has been rarely reported. Herein, nickel cobalt alloy (NiCo) and nickel cobalt sulfides (NiCoS) have been simultaneously constructed on the nitrogen-doped carbon substrate (NiCo-NiCoS/NC) via facile calcination-sulfurization of NiCo Prussian blue analogue (NiCo-PBA). The abundantly exposed NiCo alloy and NiCoS domains act as adsorption and catalytic sites that enable effective capture and catalytic conversion of polysulfides, and the highly conductive NiCoNiCoS integrated with N-doped carbon provides a facile Li+ transfer channel. As a result, S@NiCo-NiCoS/NC electrode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1345.1 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 C, superior rate capability of 692.1 mA h g(-1) up to 5 C, and ultralong lifespan over 1500 cycles with a small capacity decay of 0.055% per cycle at the current density of 1.0 C.

TI Increased Energy Density with Conjugated Polymer-Based Composite
   Electrode without Power Density Sacrifice
SO ACS APPLIED POLYMER MATERIALS
AB The joint of capacitance and diffusion contribution in electrode materials of supercapacitors is effective to achieve high energy density without power density sacrifice. Therefore, a series of donor-acceptor type conductive polymers with benzidine as the donor and other monomers having different aromaticity as the acceptor have been designed and synthesized. In this study, after the binary flexible electrode from the thiophene ring-containing polymer on carbon cloth was modified with the Prussian blue analogue CoFePBA, a flexible ternary composite electrode with integrated capacitance and diffusion capabilities was prepared. Its specific capacitance was up to 1135.72 F/g at 0.5 A/g with a retention ratio of 98.45% after 10,000 cycles. Its electrochemical performance remained basically unchanged after 1000 times of bending. When the energy density of a two-electrode supercapacitor device assembled with the as-made electrode reached up to 13.8 W h/kg, it is at a high power density of 745.9 W/kg, and it shows 6.7 W h/kg even at maximum power density of 5010.1 W/kg.

TI Homogeneous nanocube (Fe, Ni) S2 electrode material from
   Fe-Ni PBA for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are multifunctional precursors for the synthesis of a series of transition metal nanomaterials. In this study, high-performance supercapacitor hybrid electrode materials [(Fe, Ni) S-2] are obtained by a facile hydrothermal sulfidation method, where the Fe-Ni PBA is introduced as the precursor. The nanocube structure which is similar to the Fe-Ni PBA precursor is remained and delivers the structure with a large number of cracks, resulting in a larger specific surface area and good conductivity. The (Fe, Ni) S-2 electrode material possesses a high specific capacitance of 1249.1 F g(-1) at the current density of 1 A g(-1), good rate capability (915.31 F g(-1) at 20 A g(-1)), and the excellent cyclic stability (retention rate of 91.6%) after 5000 cycles. The two-electrode system condition test shows that the energy density of ASD reached 39.97 Wh kg(-1) when the power density is 0.85 kW kg(-1) including the material is a potential supercapacitor electrode material.

TI Synergistically modulating electronic structure of NiS2
   hierarchical architectures by phosphorus doping and sulfur-vacancies
   defect engineering enables efficient electrocatalytic water splitting
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The synergistic achievement of heteroatom doping, defect engineering and appropriate structural design is efficient to adjust and boost the catalytic performance of catalysts yet challenging. Herein, phosphorus (P)-doped NiS2 hierarchical architectures with sulfur vacancies are synthesized via a Prussian-blue-analogue-sacrificed strategy followed by a phosphidation process. By modulation of P doping and sulfur vacancies, the optimal catalyst manifests outstanding electrocatalytic activities, affording low overpotentials of 73 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and 255 mV at 20 mA cm-2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Density functional theory calculations certify that the P dopant not only serves as the new active sites, but also activates the electrochemical activity of neighboring Ni and S sites. Moreover, the synergistic effect of P-doping and sulfur vacancies further improve electrochemical activities of HER and OER by optimizing the adsorption free energy of hydrogen (Delta GH*) and oxygen-containing intermediates (OH*, O* and OOH*), respectively. This finding provides a directive strategy to achieve efficient non-noble metal catalysts for energy conversion and storage.

TI Hollow and porous nickel sulfide nanocubes prepared from a metal-organic
   framework as an efficient enzyme mimic for colorimetric detection of
   hydrogen peroxide
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Hollow, porous NiS nanocubes were prepared by a hydrothermal method starting from Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue nanocubes as the template. The morphology and structure of the NiS nanocubes were tuned by adjustment of the ion-exchange rate and the degree of chemical etching, and they were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and nitrogen sorption measurements. The NiS nanocubes are shown to act as a peroxidase mimic that can catalyze the oxidization of 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), producing a visible color change, for which the absorbance is best measured at 652 nm. The outstanding activity may result from the unique structure of the NiS nanocubes. The catalytic oxidation follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics and shows a ping-pong mechanism of enzyme action. The findings were used to develop a rapid, sensitive, and selective colorimetric H2O2 assay with a response that is linear in the 4-40 M range with a detection limit of 1.72 M (signal-to-noise ratio of 3).

TI Nonaqueous Synthesis of Low-Vacancy Chromium Hexacyanochromate
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are a highly tunable family of materials with properties suitable for a wide variety of applications. Although their straightforward aqueous synthesis allows for the facile preparation of a diverse set of compositions, the use of water as the solvent has hindered the preparation of specific compositions with highly sought-after properties. A typical example is Cr[Cr(CN)6]: its predicted strong magnetic interactions have motivated many attempts at its synthesis but with limited success. The lack of control over vacancies, crystallinity, and the oxidation state has prevented the experimental validation of its theoretical magnetic properties. Here, we report the nonaqueous synthesis of vacancy-suppressed, nanocrystalline chromium hexacyanochromate. The control over vacancies and the oxidation state leads to stronger magnetic interactions with a markedly increased absolute Weiss temperature (Theta = -836(6) K) and magnetic ordering temperature of (240 +/- 10) K. Our results challenge the notion of the solvent as merely reaction medium and introduce a pathway for exploring moisture- and air-sensitive PBA compositions.

TI Ethanol Based Electrolyte for Ultra-stable Zn/NiHCF Batteries
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have attracted widespread attention as cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) in view of their open frameworks, adjustable redox sites, and high operating voltages. However, the poor cycling stability limits its practical application severely. Herein, the cubic K2NiFe(CN)(6) (NiHCF) is prepared as the active cathode material for AZIBs. The cycling stability of the Zn/NiHCF battery is improved greatly just by simply replacing the H2O with ethanol (EA) as electrolyte solvent. Ex-situ XRD and SEM characterizations reveal the stable morphology of NiHCF during charging/discharge process in the 0.5 M Zn(OTf)(2)-EA electrolyte and violent phase transformation from NiHCF to Zn2Fe(CN)(6) in 3 M Zn(OTf)(2)-H2O electrolyte, indicating that 0.5 M Zn(OTf)(2)-EA electrolyte can inhibit the negative phase transformation aging process of NiHCF and improve the electrochemical performance effectively. Impressively, the Zn/NiHCF battery with 0.5 M Zn(OTf)(2)-EA as electrolyte exhibits a really high capacity retention rate of 94.2 % after 500 cycles at 150 mA g(-1).

TI Double quenching electrochemiluminescence aptsensor based on free
   radical elimination and resonance energy transfer for the sensitive
   detection of zearalenonea
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB Zearalenone (ZEN) has serious impacts on human and animal health due to its mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, and genetic toxicity. In this study, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptsensor for ultrasensitive ZEN detection was constructed based on the double quenching effect of CM-MOFs. Luminol was fixed on the gold nanoparticle-modified Prussian blue analogs (Au NPs@PBAs) with catalytic activity by Au-NH2 to obtain Lu@Au@PBAs with stable and strong signal output. Bimetallic porphyrin metal-organic frameworks (CM-MOFs) improve the sensitivity of aptsensors through radical elimination and resonance energy transfer strategies. The experimental data shows that the dynamic detection range of the aptsensor is 500 fg/mL similar to 100 ng/mL, and the limit of detection is as low as 0.37 pg/mL. The aptsensor is proven to be suitable for the detection of ZEN in corn flour and has strong practicability. It is important that the ECL detection strategy can be used to detect other similar analytes and has a wide range of potential applications in food analytical detection.

TI Simple enzyme-free detection of uric acid by an in situ
   fluorescence and colorimetric method based on Co-PBA with high oxidase
   activity
SO ANALYST
AB In this work, we prepared a simple and low-cost cobalt-doped Prussian blue analog (Co-PBA), which can directly oxidize 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to produce resorufin (ox-AR) with high fluorescent quantum yield and ox-TMB with blue color, respectively, without the need for unstable H2O2. Using the Michaelis-Menten curve and Lineweaver-Burk equation, the Michaelis-Menten constant of Co-PBA and the substrate TMB was found to be 0.033 mM, which was much lower than horseradish peroxidase and other reported nanozymes, showing satisfactory substrate affinity. Uric acid (UA) can cause erosion of the Co-PBA structure, and it significantly reduces the catalytic activity of Co-PBA, resulting in the decrease of the fluorescence emission signal of ox-AR and the absorption signal of ox-TMB. Based on this, a simple, sensitive, and fast fluorescence/colorimetric dual-mode uric acid detection platform was established. The detection range for UA by fluorescence method is 0.625-40 mu M, and the detection limit (LOD, S/N = 3) is as low as 0.389 mu M. The detection system was applied to serum samples with good recovery and can be used for field detection of UA in biological samples under different environments to meet different needs.

TI Advancements in cathode technology, recycling strategies, and market
   dynamics: A comprehensive review of sodium ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The rising demand for sodium -ion batteries (SIBs) in commercial applications emphasizes the importance of meeting commercial criteria. Despite their potential, SIBs encounter challenges related to specific energy, cycling life, and specific power due to the unique characteristics of sodium ions. Design strategies, surface engineering, and structural modifications for cathode materials have been devised to improve the electrochemical performance of SIBs. In SIBs, the energy density primarily depends on the choice of cathode materials. Common cathode materials nowadays include transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds, and Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). Enhancing these materials through targeted modifications to overcome their limitations is crucial for transitioning them from lab -scale to practical use. However, there are still some challenges to address before cathode materials can be effectively utilized for large-scale energy storage in SIBs. Recycling spent SIBs poses significant economic and environmental challenges, particularly compared to lithium -ion batteries (LIBs). Despite progress in cathode materials, thorough environmental assessments and detailed inventory data are lacking for SIBs. The early stage of their development restricts metal recycling in SIBs, underscoring the significance of end -of -life treatment. Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are commonly employed for metal recovery, with pyrometallurgy favored for SIBs due to reduced sodium evaporation risks. The marketing and commercialization trends in SIBs reflect the growing demand for renewable energy solutions. SIBs, with their potential for grid -scale energy storage, are expected to support the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. However, overcoming technological challenges and reducing costs are key to SIB commercialization. In this regard, startups are playing a significant role in advancing SIB technologies for large-scale energy storage applications. The collaboration between companies and advancements in manufacturing facilities are driving SIB production, marking substantial progress towards commercialization. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current research and advancements in SIB technology.

TI In situ fabrication of CuO nanowire film for high-sensitive
   ascorbic acid recognition
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB One-dimensional metal oxides have been attracting interest as advanced materials for trace target recognition in chemical sensors due to their ultra-high surface area and electrochemical activity. However, the development of a large-scale and controllable fabrication strategy remains a great challenge and has hindered their practical application. In this work, we design a novel thermal oxidation route for obtaining a large area of CuO nanowires by the use of a film precursor of the nanocubic Cu-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA). The nanostructure and distribution of the PBA film was precisely controlled using an electrostatic self-assembly approach. The CuO nanowire shape was formed in-situ via the growth confinement effect through the air-heating collapse and oxidation of PBA crystals. At a very low working potential of 0.1 V, the as-prepared CuO nanowire sensor exhibited excellent sensing performance on ascorbic acid over a wide linear range (20-400 mu M) and a low detection limit (0.5 mu M), as well as high selectivity despite various interferences.

TI Cobalt-iron selenides embedded in porous carbon nanofibers for
   simultaneous electrochemical detection of trace of hydroquinone,
   catechol and resorcinol
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB In this study, cobalt-iron selenides embedded in porous carbon nanofibers (CoFe2Se4/PCF), derived from Prussian blue analogues, was prepared as a novel phenolic sensor. The obtained CoFe2Se4/PCF nanocomposites show three-dimensional (3D) networks nanostructures that can supply a desirable conductive network to accelerate electron transfer and avoid the aggregation of CoFe2Se4 nanoparticles. Electrochemical detection of hydroquinone (HQ), catechol (CC) and resorcinol (RS), at CoFe2Se4/PCF modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) were researched. The results show the obtained 3D CoFe2Se4/PCF/GCE exhibits excellent electrochemical properties towards the simultaneous testing trace of HQ CC and RS. The obtained electrode provides wide linear ranges of 0.5-200, 0.5-190 and 5-350 mu M and low detection limit of 0.13, 0.15 and 1.36 mu M for HQ CC and RS, respectively. The as-prepared phenolic sensor displays satisfied selectivity and long-term storage stability. In addition, the constructed sensor can be used to determine HQ CC and RS in actual samples.

TI MOF-derived yolk-shell CdS microcubes with enhanced visible-light
   photocatalytic activity and stability for hydrogen evolution
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Yolk-shell structures with a unique three-dimensional (3D) open architecture offer great advantages for constructing advanced photocatalysts. However, metal sulfides with yolk-shell nanostructures were rarely reported. In this work, unique yolk-shell CdS microcubes are synthesized from Cd-Fe Prussian blue analogues (Cd-Fe-PBA) through a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal process. Their formation mechanism is also proposed based on the anion exchange and Kirkendall effect process. Benefitting from structural merits, including a 3D open structure, small size of primary nanoparticles, high specific surface area, and good structural robustness, the obtained yolk-shell CdS microcubes manifest excellent performances for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from H2O under visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate is 3051.4 mmol h(-1) g(-1) (with an apparent quantum efficiency of 4.9% at 420 nm), which is similar to 2.43 times higher than that of conventional CdS nanoparticles. Furthermore, the yolk-shell CdS microcubes exhibit remarkable photocatalytic stability. This work demonstrates that MOF-derived yolk-shell structured materials hold great promise for application in the field of energy conversion.

TI An Open-Framework Structured Material:
   [Ni(en)2]3[Fe(CN)6]2 as a
   Cathode Material for Aqueous Sodium- and Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Open-framework structured materials such as Prussian blue analogues and sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) materials have been regarded as promising electrode candidates for aqueous batteries. These materials exhibit outstanding long cycle stability and high rate capacity retention, due to their high ion diffusive rate in the crystal and the stable structure maintenance in the electrochemical reaction process. Herein, an open-framework structured material [Ni(en)(2)](3)[Fe(CN)(6)](2) (NienHCF) is prepared and first used as a cathode material for aqueous sodium- and potassium-ion batteries. The resultant material exhibits a high output potential and outstanding cycle performance (93.4% after 500 cycles at 1 A g(-1)) in K-ion batteries. Meanwhile, the electrochemical reaction mechanism is investigated. After coupling with the activated carbon anode, the K-ion full cell has 91.5% capacity retention at 5 A g(-1) and retains 77.2% after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1), exhibiting the potential as an electrode material for rechargeable aqueous K-ion and Na-ion batteries.

TI A metal-organic framework derived PtCo/C electrocatalyst for ethanol
   electro-oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Currently, designing and preparing low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts still remains of huge impediment for direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC5). In this work, by leveraging the unique superiority of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) (Prussian blue analogues, PBA) precursor, we used Pt4+ to replace partial dispersed Co2+ in Co-3(Co(CN)(6)](2) and a metal-organic framework (MOF) derived PtCo electrocatalyst (MD-PtCo/C) was successfully fabricated. Notably, as-obtained MD-PtCo/C (Pt, 0.9532 wt.%) electrocatalyst achieves high utilization rate of ultra-low Pt load and exhibits favorable electrocatalytic performance with lower onset potential, higher FOR activity, less activation energy (E-a) value and better stability compared to commercial Pt/C for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Moreover, the consequence of concentrations (ICON, C2H5OH) and temperatures on electrocatalytic activity of FOR have also been studied. This study would be supportive of developing highly active and low-cost electrocatalysts for other catalytic applications. (C) 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI In Situ Coupling Reconstruction of Cobalt-Iron Oxide on a Cobalt
   Phosphate Nanoarray with Interfacial Electronic Features for Highly
   Enhanced Water Oxidation Catalysis
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Research in non-noble cobalt-related electrocatalysts to produce H-2 and O-2 by water splitting has aroused much attention because of the favorable adsorption of intermediates and low energy barriers. The design of hybrid electrocatalysts can be guided by the synergetic interface for outstanding performance. Herein, the CoFeO-CoPi@NF hybrid is prepared from cobalt ion Prussian blue analogues (CoFe-PBA) in situ grown on the Co-3(PO4)(2)center dot 4H(2)O nanograss. The annealed CoFeO-CoPi@ NF exhibits favorable anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and significant stability. The isolated CoFe2O4 nanocubes on CoPi easily transform into ultrathin CoFe2O4 nanosheets covering CoPi uniformly, forming strong coupling interfaces. The electrons transfer from CoFe2O4 to CoPi because of the matched band structures and Fermi levels. The resultant increased content of Co2+ and the red shift of the valence band maximum could facilitate the surface reconstruction to improve the OER performance. This paves the way to optimize the electronic structure and make the surface reconstruction prone in advanced OER.

TI Individual-collective crossover driven by particle size in dense
   assemblies of superparamagnetic nanoparticles
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBA) ferromagnetic nanoparticles Cs-x(I) Ni-II[Cr-III(CN)(6)](z) center dot 3(H2O) embedded in CTA(+) (cetyltrimethylammonium) matrix have been investigated by magnetometry and magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Choosing particle sizes (diameter D = 4.8 and 8.6 nm) well below the single-domain radius and comparable volume fraction of particle, we show that the expected superparamagnetic regime for weakly anisotropic isolated magnetic particles is drastically affected due to the interplay of surface/ volume anisotropies and dipolar interactions. For the smallest particles (D = 4.8 nm), magnetocrystalline anisotropy is enhanced by surface spins and drives the system into a regime of ferromagnetically correlated clusters characterized by a temperature-dependent magnetic correlation length L-mag which is experimentally accessible using magnetic SANS. For D = 8.6 nm particles, a superparamagnetic regime is recovered in a wide temperature range. We propose a model of interacting single-domain particles with axial anisotropy that accounts quantitatively for the observed behaviors in both magnetic regimes.

TI Boron-doped CoP/nitrogen-doped carbon drives enhanced alkaline hydrogen
   evolution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Developing durable and efficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great importance for hydrogen production. By judiciously doping nonmetallic elements into transition metal electrocatalysts, the respective electronic configurations of the catalysts can be effectively adjusted, and their activity levels can be improved. Herein, B-doped CoP/nitrogen-doped carbon (B-CoP/NC) was constructed by subjecting B-doped Co-Prussian blue analogue to a phosphidation process. Benefiting from an enhanced electrochemical active area, improved conductivity, and suitable electron distribution caused by the introduction of B, the defective nanocubes of the B-CoP/NC catalyst needed overpotentials of only 158 and 234 mV to achieve current densities of, respectively, 10 and 100 mA cm-2 and showed a low Tafel slope of 67 mV dec-1. This work has supplied a general route involving NaBH4 pretreatment for introducing B into transition metal phosphide and has offered a method for designing HER catalysts.
   B-CoP/NC is developed as a high-activity and robust catalyst for HER via phosphidation of B-doped Co-PBA.

TI Spectroscopically unraveling high-valence Ni-Fe catalytic synergism in
   NiSe2/FeSe2 heterostructure
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB Heterostructured compounds with rationally engineered interfaces are widely reported as efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, but the mechanism of the intrinsic activities still unclear. Herein, a typical model catalyst of NiSe2/FeSe2 heterostructure with a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term durability is fabricated by selenizing Ni-Fe Prussian-blue analog (PBA) templates. In-situ/operando Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are employed to reveal the real catalytic process. It is attested that the dynamic surface reconstruction into Ni-O-Fe configurations, and the high-valence NiIII-O-FeIII moieties in Ni-FeOOH is responsible for the high oxygen evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations further confirm that the electron transfer driven by strong Ni-Fe synergistic effect in NiSe2/ FeSe2 heterostructure not only improves the density of Ni/Fe active sites, but also modulates the nature active sites. This works may deepen our understanding of intrinsic activities of metal compound heterostructures and the correlation between dynamic surface structural evolution and catalytic activity.

TI Ratiometric Colorimetric Detection of Nitrite Realized by Stringing
   Nanozyme Catalysis and Diazotization Together
SO BIOSENSORS-BASEL
AB Due to the great threat posed by excessive nitrite in food and drinking water to human health, it calls for developing reliable, convenient, and low-cost methods for nitrite detection. Herein, we string nanozyme catalysis and diazotization together and develop a ratiometric colorimetric approach for sensing nitrite in food. First, hollow MnFeO (a mixture of Mn and Fe oxides with different oxidation states) derived from a Mn-Fe Prussian blue analogue is explored as an oxidase mimic with high efficiency in catalyzing the colorless 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) oxidation to blue TMBox, presenting a notable signal at 652 nm. Then, nitrite is able to trigger the diazotization of the product TMBox, not only decreasing the signal at 652 nm but also producing a new signal at 445 nm. Thus, the analyte-induced reverse changes of the two signals enable us to establish a ratiometric colorimetric assay for nitrite analysis. According to the above strategy, facile determination of nitrite in the range of 3.3-133.3 mu M with good specificity was realized, providing a detection limit down to 0.2 mu M. Compared with conventional single-signal analysis, our dual-signal ratiometric colorimetric mode was demonstrated to offer higher sensitivity, a lower detection limit, and better anti-interference ability against external detection environments. Practical applications of the approach in examining nitrite in food matrices were also verified.

TI Ultrasensitive and multiplexed Gastric cancer biomarkers detection with
   an integrated electrochemical immunosensing platform
SO TALANTA
AB Developing immunosensing platforms capable of simultaneously detecting multiple cancer markers is crucial for clinical diagnosis and biomedical research. Here, we introduce a novel dual-mode electrochemical biosensing assay platform capable of detecting two gastric cancer biomarkers: pepsinogen I (PG I) and pepsinogen II (PG II). Methylene blue (MB) and Prussian blue (PB) were used as dual signal sources to label PG I and PG II, respectively. The platform integrates an ARM STM32F411 microcontroller and an AD5941 analog front-end, which not only facilitates cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with efficacy comparable to commercial electrochemical workstations but also offers data collection and synchronous analysis capabilities, allowing simultaneous output of PG I and PGR (PG I/PG II) values. Equipped with an interactive screen for operational control and result display, the immunosensing platform provides linear detection ranges for PG I (5 pg/mL-100 ng/mL) and PG II (50 pg/mL-200 ng/mL), enabling rapid detection within 5 min. It demonstrates excellent sensitivity and selectivity when comparing serum samples from healthy individuals and gastric cancer patients. The dual-marker detection platform significantly enhances early diagnosis and screening of gastric cancer, offering substantial improvements over single-marker assays. Furthermore, this platform shows potential for detecting multiple biomarkers in various diseases, highlighting its utility for biomedical applications.

   nanocubes as high-performance anodes for lithium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Sponge-like porous Ni1.8Fe1.2O4 nanocubes were prepared by heating Prussian blue analogue KNi (x) Fe3-x (CN)(6)center dot nH(2)O nanocubes. It is showed that the nanocubes exhibit nanoscale particles, multiple through-hole frameworks and high surface area owing to the emission organic molecules, such as CO (x) and NO (y) , during the heat treatment process in air at 300 A degrees C. When it is used as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) anode material shows an outstanding rate performance with advanced capacities of 1268, 1189, 1156, 1052, 1028 and 858 mAh g(-1) at 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 mA g(-1), respectively. The sponge-like porous and large specific surface area of nanocubes shorten the diffusion path for Li ion and electron and evidently mitigation bulk effects during discharge/charge process, which effectively improve electrochemical performance of LIBs. These results show that the sponge-like porous Ni1.8Fe1.2O4 nanocubes have a great application value as LIBs anode in view of its facile and effective preparation technology and excellent electrochemical performance.

TI An amorphous manganese iron oxide hollow nanocube cathode for aqueous
   zinc ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) are attracting considerable attentions for practical energy storage because of their low cost and high safety. Nevertheless, the traditional manganese oxide cathode materials suffer from the low intrinsic electronic conductivity, sluggish ions diffusion kinetics, and structural collapse, hindering their large-scale application. Herein, we successfully developed a latent amorphous Mn1.8Fe1.2O4 hollow nanocube (a-H-MnFeO) cathode material derived from Prussian blue analogue precursor. The amorphous nature endows the cathode with lower diffusion barrier and narrower band gap compared with crystalline counterpart, resulting in the superior Zn2+ ions and electrons transport kinetics. Hollow structure can furnish abundant surface sites and suppress the structural collapse during the repeated charge/discharge processes. By virtue of the multiple advantageous features, the a-H-MnFeO cathode exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance, in terms of high capacity, excellent rate capability, and prolonged cycle life. This strategy will pave the way for the structural design of emerging cathode materials.(c) 2023 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Studies reported so far on this fascinating new field have been glanced through with a critical perspective and a debate on the limitations, gaps and general misconceptions that can be found related to these nanomaterials and their properties has been initiated. A thorough discussion on the often-confused cascade mechanisms of redox reactions driven by these multi-nanozymes has been brought into the limelight for the first time and the examples of various multi-nanozymes that have been employed in biological applications have been evaluated categorically.

TI Energy harvesting thermocell with use of phase transition
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A thermocell that consists of cathode and anode materials with different temperature coefficients (alpha=dV/dT) of the redox potential (V) can convert environmental thermal energy to electric energy via the so-called thermal charging effect. The output voltage V-cell of the current thermocell, however, is still low (several tens mV) and depends on temperature, which are serious drawbacks for practical use of the device as an independent power supply. Here, we report that usage of phase transition material as electrode qualitatively improve the device performance. We set the critical temperature (T-c) for the phase transition in cobalt Prussian blue analogue (Co-PBA; NaxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](y)) to just above room temperature, by finely adjusting the Fe concentration (y=0.82). With increase in the cell temperature (T-cell), V-cell of the NaxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](0.82) (NCF82)/NaxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](0.9) (NCF90) cell steeply increases from 0mV to similar to 120mV around 320K. Our observation indicates that the thermocell with use of phase transition is a promising energy harvesting device.

TI Shape-controlled Mn-Fe PBA derived micromotors for organic pollutant
   removal
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB A new simple strategy to prepare Mn-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) derived oxide micromotors through co-precipitation and heat treatment is demonstrated. The morphology of the precursors could be precisely controlled from cubic-like to spherical-like by introducing citrate. Because of the synergistic catalytic reaction of bimetallic Mn-Fe oxides, micromotors with different shapes could be powered efficiently in H2O2 solution. In particular, the obtained cubic Mn-Fe oxide micromotors showed strong propulsion at a speed of 71.21 mu m s(-1) in 1% H2O2 solution. With dual mechanisms of adsorption bubble separation (ABS) and Fenton oxidation, the cubic Mn-Fe oxide micromotors showed extraordinary removal ability for Rhodamine B (RhB) as a simulated pollutant and could remove up to 95.2% of RhB within 30 minutes. Magnetic Fe3O4 contained in the component not only could degrade organic pollutants, but also could be recycled by magnetic field and reused with high degradation efficiency. These dual-functional metal oxide catalytic micromotors provide a practical and environmentally friendly strategy for environmental restoration.

TI Extended charge-transfer model for
   NaxCo[Fe(CN)6]0.82
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Cobalt Prussian blue analogues (NaxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](y): x similar to 4y - 3) whose valences are close to CO3+ and Fe2+ show characteristic phase transitions triggered by cooperative charge transfer (CT) from Fe2+ to Co3+. Here, we extended the cooperative CT to the entire region of sodium concentration (0 <= x <= 4y - 2). We systematically investigated (1) upper (T-c(u)) and lower (T-c(l)) critical temperature, (2) variation of the [Fe2+(CN)(6)](4-) ([Fe3+(CN)(6)](3-)) concentration, and (3) spectral weight (I-ET) due to electron transfer from Fe2+ to Co3+ of thin films of NaxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](0.82) against x. In a wide x region from 0.00 to 0.57, we observed first-order phase transition triggered by the cooperative CT. The extended CT model reproduces the x-dependent behavior of the [Fe-II(CN)(6)](4-) (Fe-III(CN)(6)(3-)) concentration and I-ET, except for the high-x region above x similar to 0.9.

TI Poly(3,4-Ethylene Dioxythiophene)/Poly(Styrene Sulfonate) Electrodes in
   Electrochemical Cells for Harvesting Waste Heat
SO ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
AB Low-grade waste heat is harvested using electrochemical cells. However, the high cost of commonly used platinum electrodes limits their application. Herein, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) films are reported as attractive alternatives to platinum electrodes, as they show a lower charge transfer resistance. Using ferricyanide/ferrocyanide as the electrolyte, the PEDOT/PSS-based thermoelectrochemical cell with dimensions of 5 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm delivers a maximum power output of 300 mu W with 1 omega loading at a temperature difference of approximate to 30 K, which is sufficient for driving an array of light-emitting diodes and Bluetooth humidity/temperature sensors for wireless communication. Furthermore, PEDOT/PSS offers the advantage of compatibility with insoluble redox couples such as Prussian blue analog materials, which facilitates determining the temperature-dependent redox potential of different materials. The appropriate combination of redox couples enables realizing thermally regenerative electrochemical cells. Power can be generated during an environmental temperature change; however, the temperature difference between different electrodes need not be maintained for these cells.

TI Highly active Cu2O/CoCo-PBA S-scheme heterojunction for enhanced
   visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution
SO SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues is a unique class of organic-inorganic hybrid materials that have garnered significant attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their large specific surface area and abundant active sites. However, their potential is limited by the challenge of photogenerated charge carrier recombination. To address this issue, we successfully synthesized a tightly coupled Cu2O/CoCo-PBA S-scheme heterojunction catalyst using ultrasound-assisted and thermal treatment methods, aiming to reduce the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. In this system, CoCo-PBA serves as the electron donor, while Cu2O acts as the electron acceptor. The closely coupled interface between these materials shortens the electron transfer distance. Under 10 W white light irradiation, the Cu2O/CoCo-PBA composite photocatalyst demonstrated remarkable hydrogen evolution activity, with a hydrogen production rate of 5.98 mmol center dot g-1 center dot h-1, which is 6.4 times that of CoCo-PBA alone. This S-scheme heterojunction strategy lays the groundwork for the design and large-scale application of highly active visible-light-driven photocatalysts.

TI Tin modification of sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate as a superior
   cathode material for sodium ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Tin modified sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, as a Prussian blue analogue, is studied as a cathode material for sodium ion batteries. By co-precipitation of Sn4+ during the synthesis process, the modified sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate materials crystallize with face-centered cubic structure with space group Fm (3) over barm, while the unmodified one possesses a rhombohedral structure with space group R (3) over barm. Compared to the unmodified material, the modified materials exhibit smaller particles with rougher surface, showing improved rate capability and cycling stability. The material modified by 10% Sn maintains 80.5% capacity after 100 cycles at 2 C (240 mA g(-1)) and delivers 53.4 mA h g(-1) at 20 C. Both Fe and Mn take part in the redox reaction and the structural changes are reversible upon the initial Na+ extraction and insertion for both pristine and modified samples. For long-term cycling, the modified materials undergo less structural transformation than the pristine material that may lead to a better structural stability, and furthermore to enhanced cycling performance.

TI CoP2/Fe-CoP2 yolk-shell nanoboxes as efficient
   electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction
SO NANOSCALE
AB The development of an efficient electrocatalyst is an important requirement for water splitting systems to produce clean and sustainable hydrogen fuel. Herein, we synthesized CoP2/Fe-CoP2 yolk-shell nanoboxes (YSBs) as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Initially, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67/CoFe-Prussian blue analogue (ZIF-67/CoFe-PBA) YSBs were prepared by the reaction of ZIF-67 and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions in the presence of a small amount of water as an etching agent. The size of the CoP2 yolk depends on the amount of water. The heteronanostructure composed of the CoP2 yolk and the FexCo1-xP2 shell with a cubic shape was obtained by phosphidation of ZIF-67/CoFe-PBA YSBs. Benefiting from the unique structure and chemical composition, the CoP2/Fe-CoP2 YSB electrocatalyst has a large specific surface area of 114 m(2) g(-1) and shows superior electrocatalytic performances for the OER such as a low overpotential of 266 mV, a small Tafel slope value of 68.1 mV dec(-1), and excellent cyclic stability.

TI Boosting Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation of Hematite in Acidic
   Electrolytes by Surface State Modification
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB State-of-the-art water-oxidation catalysts (WOCs) in acidic electrolytes usually contain expensive noble metals such as ruthenium and iridium. However, they too expensive to be implemented broadly in semiconductor photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting devices. Here, an Earth-abundant CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) is incorporated with core-shell Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 type II heterojunction nanowires as composite photoanodes for PEC water splitting. Those deliver a high photocurrent of 1.25 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible reference electrode in acidic electrolytes (pH = 1). The enhancement arises from the synergic behavior between the successive decoration of the hematite surface with nanolayers of Fe2TiO5 and then, CoFe-PBA. The underlying physical mechanism of performance enhancement through formation of the Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/CoFe-PBA heterostructure reveals that the surface states' electronic levels of hematite are modified such that an interfacial charge transfer becomes kinetically favorable. These findings open new pathways for the future design of cheap and efficient hematite-based photoanodes in acidic electrolytes.

TI Fenton/Fenton-like microreactor in inflammatory microenvironment:
   Photothermal enhanced catalytic oxidation strategy for chemodynamic
   treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint hypoxia and the proliferation of M1 macrophages. Therefore, relieving hypoxia and removing M1 macrophages will be a new direction in the treatment of RA. Folic acid (FA)-loaded PCP nanoparticles Fe-Co prussian blue analogue@CeO2@PDA (F-PCP) were used for in situ oxygen (O2) production/chemodynamic/photothermal/treatment of RA. On one hand, PDA-mediated photothermal therapy also has a certain effect on the removal of proliferative M1 macrophages. On the other hand, under the irradiation of NIR laser, F-PCP has obtained excellent photothermal therapy (PTT) performance, which accelerates the Fenton/Fenton-like reaction to produce reactive oxygen species and O2, so as to achieve the chemodynamic therapy (CDT) that inhibits the proliferation of M1 macrophages. It is worth noting that the RA was improved by the synergistic action of CDT and PTT, and the generation of oxygen can alleviate RA hypoxia, which is a means to improve CDT. Therefore, the F-PCP NPs show great potential in improving the therapeutic effect of RA.

TI Highly Dispersed Cobalt Nanoparticles Embedded in Nitrogen-Doped
   Graphitized Carbon for Fast and Durable Potassium Storage
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB Potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have great potential for applications in large-scale energy storage devices. However, the larger radius of K+ leads to sluggish kinetics and inferior cycling performance, severely restricting its practical applicability. Herein, we propose a rational strategy involving a Prussian blue analogue-derived graphitized carbon anode with fast and durable potassium storage capability, which is constructed by encapsulating cobalt nanoparticles in nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon (Co-NC). Both experimental and theoretical results show that N-doping effectively promotes the uniform dispersion of cobalt nanoparticles in the carbon matrix through Co-N bonds. Moreover, the cobalt nanoparticles and strong Co-N bonds synergistically form a three-dimensional conductive network, increase the number of adsorption sites, and reduce the diffusion energy barrier, thereby facilitating the adsorption and the diffusion kinetics. These multiple effects lead to enhanced reversible capacities of 305 and 208.6 mAh g(-1) after 100 and 300 cycles at 0.05 and 0.1 A g(-1), respectively, demonstrating the applicability of the Co-NC anode for KIBs.

TI Template synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages-encapsulated
   carbon nanobubbles as catalyst for activation of peroxymonosulfate
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages-encapsulated carbon nanobubbles (CBs@NCCs) were feasibly fabricated by the in situ thermal conversion of Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues (Co-Fe PBAs) coated with polydopamine (PDA) shells. Interestingly, PBA cores can act as a self-sacrificing template and decompose during high-temperature treatment. PDA shells play a crucial role in stabilizing the steric architecture, supplementing nitrogen-doping of CBs@NCCs under high-temperature treatments. When compared with carbon nanobubbles (CBs) without the protection of carbon nanocages, CBs@NCCs possess higher specific surface area and pore volume. The contributions of a unique configuration and proper nitrogen modification are significant for improving the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation performance of CBs@NCCs, which is expected to be a promising alternative to other conventional carbocatalysts and metal oxides. Moreover, the applicability of the as-synthesized carbocatalysts was systematically investigated by adjusting several operating parameters, and some ubiquitous anions and natural organic matters (NOMs) were also taken into account in methylene blue (MB) degradation. The radical evolution and PMS activation mechanism are investigated by radical quenching and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests, which revealed that sulfate radicals (SO4-) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) are simultaneously responsible for the overall MB removal in a CBs@NCCs-800/PMS system. This study may provide a broader perspective for upgrading the catalytic efficiency of various green heterogeneous carbocatalysts.

TI Self-assembly of MoS2 nanosheet adhered on Fe-MOF
   heterocrystals for peroxymonosulfate activation via interfacial
   interaction
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB A novel heterogeneous catalyst PB@MoS2 was successfully synthesized via facile hydrothermal processes and identified as a superior peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator for organic pollutants degradation under visible light irradiation. The MoS2 nanosheet is uniformly adhered to the surface of iron-based metal-organic framework Prussian blue (PB) cube, exhibiting a tightly hydrangeas-like structure. Benefiting from strongly interfacial interaction (FeMo-sulfide) between PB and MoS2, as confirmed by Fe-57 M''ossbauer spectra and electrochemical measurement, the PB@MoS2 catalyst significantly accelerate the charge carrier transfer via interfacial FeMo-sulfide and thereby improve PMS activation ability to generate abundant reactive radicals. Moreover, the crucial iron active site was steadily validated by introduction of sodium oxalate trapping agent and visible light. In summary, the visible light induced Fenton-like reaction over PB@MoS2 catalyst promoted the Fe-II/Fe-III cycling and electron transport and further triggered the reactive species (SO4, center dot OH, center dot O-2 and h(+)) productivity, realizing an extraordinarily high degradation and mineralization efficiency for various refractory organic pollutants. This work would provide a deep insight into develop heterogeneous Fe-based metal organic framework/MoS2 catalyst for environmental restoration and remediation by photo-Fenton reaction.

TI Rational construction of graphene oxide with MOF-derived porous NiFe@C
   nanocubes for high-performance microwave attenuation
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Exploring lightweight microwave attenuation materials with strong and tunable wideband microwave absorption is highly desirable but remains a significant challenge. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) porous hybrid composites consisting of NiFe nanoparticles embedded within carbon nanocubes decorated on graphene oxide (GO) sheets (NiFe@C nanocubes@GO) as high-performance microwave attenuation materials have been rationally synthesized. The 3D porous hybrid composites are fabricated by a simple method, which involves one-step pyrolysis of NiFe Prussian blue analogue nanocubes in the presence of GO sheets. Benefiting from the unique structural features that exhibit good magnetic and dielectric losses as well as a proper impedance match, the resulting NiFe@C nanocubes@GO composites show excellent microwave attenuation ability. With a minimum reflection loss (RL) of-51 dB at 7.7 GHz at a thickness of 2.8 mm and maximum percentage bandwidth of 38.6% for RL <-10 dB at a thickness of 2.2 mm, the NiFe@C nanocubes@GO composites are superior to the previously reported state-of-the-art carbon-based microwave attenuation materials.

TI Argentophilic Hydrogen Ferrocyanide Electrodes for Robust Electrokinetic
   Flow in a Non-Gassing Pump
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The present study reports a non-gassing and non-contaminating electrode material and its characterization for potential applications in a microfluidic device such as insulin pump. An electroosmotic pump was assembled by sandwiching a silica membrane between two flow-through argentophilic hydrogen ferrocyanide electrodes made up of ascorbate reduction of silver ferricyanide (cathode) and silver ferrocyanide (anode). This assembly generated a electroosmotic flux of 80 mu L/min/cm(2) with the application of 1 V across the cell. The flow increased linearly with the applied voltage. Passage of 0.7 C resulted 2.7 mL of water flow. This is equivalent to flow of 2.1 x 10(4) water molecules for the passage of each electron. This is the high performance electrode material reported for non-gassing, non-contaminating and low voltage electroosmotic pump in the literature with stall pressure of similar to 2 kPa at 1 V applied voltage. The pump operates exclusively by electro-oxidation of hydrogen ferrocyanide at anode and electro-reduction of polymeric prussian blue analogue at cathode. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

TI Sandwich-structured
   Co3[Co(CN)6]2/P(VDF-HFP) piezoelectric
   composites with superior electromechanical activity
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB The development of piezoelectric polymers with superior electromechanical performance is a demand in the areas of flexible sensors, actuators and tissue engineering, among others. In this work, we reported a novel sandwich-structured piezoelectric composites comprising of poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) [P(VDF-HFP)] and Prussian blue analogs Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) with excellent electromechanical activities. The large specific surface area, unique three-dimensional porous nanostructure and redox behavior of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) appeared to significantly promote the interfacial coupling effect within P(VDF-HFP), resulting in enhanced electromechanical response. Moreover, the sandwich structure topological design would enlarge the interfacial coupling effect, strengthen the breakdown strength and consequently raise the electromechanical performance. For instance, a maximum piezoelectric coefficient d(33) of similar to 41 pC/N can be achieved in the sandwiched composites at a loading of 0.8 wt%, which is 1.78 times that of pure P(VDF-HFP). Furthermore, the sandwiched composites possess superior electromechanical coupling factor k(33) up to 0.215, while that of pure P(VDF-HFP) is only 0.134.

TI Vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets on N-doped carbon
   nanotubes with NiFe alloy for overall water splitting
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Carbon based nanotubes have attracted significant attention as substrates for anchoring metal-based nanoparticles. Dopants endow these nanotubes with high activity as electro-chemical catalysts. Herein, N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) containing NiFe alloy nanoparticles (NiFe-NCNT) are prepared by calcining a mixture of NiFe Prussian blue analogue (NiFe-PBA) and melamine. MoS(2)nanosheets are then loaded onto NiFe-NCNTviaa hydrothermal process. The resulting MoS2-decorated NiFe-NCNT reveals excellent performance in overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.6 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), because of its well-developed hierarchical structure and highly conductive NCNTs that enable efficient transport of generated carriers. The calcination temperature affects the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of NiFe-NCNT. Further, loading MoS(2)nanosheets improves the HER activities of the NiFe-NCNT. The amount of MoS(2)nanosheets affects the activities of electrocatalytic overall water splitting. These materials reveal excellent electrocatalytic activity due to the synergistic effect of NiFe-NCNT and MoS(2)nanosheets as well as the NiFe alloy nanoparticles.

   evolution reaction
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB In order to satisfy the desire of energy shortage for excellent OER catalyst, phosphide (Co0.4Fe0.28P), and sulfide (Co0.37Fe0.26S) nanocubes (NCs) were synthesized by heating CoFe-based Prussian blue analogues (CoFe-PBA) precursors under different atmosphere, respectively. The prepared Co0.4Fe0.28P and Co0.37Fe0.26S NCs have defined stoichiometry and larger surface area, which revealed excellent electrocatalytic activities toward OER in alkaline condition. Co0.4Fe0.28P and Co0.37Fe0.26S nanocubes show an excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER in 1 M KOH, which are superior to the state-of-the-art commercialized IrOx catalyst and most of MOFs derived OER catalyst. Furthermore, we also briefly study the different electrochemical oxidation driving (EOD) influence of Co0.4Fe0.28P and Co0.37Fe0.26S NCs for exposed more active sites and further discovering that sulfides show a better driving effect. We expect to give some inspiration on the design of OER catalysts with enhanced performance, and catalysts applied in other designs of the new catalyst. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Co3InC0.75-In2O3 composite construction and its synergetic hydrogenation
   catalysis of CO2 to methanol
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB The efficient catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol is a promising route for CO2 emission mitigation and utilization. Recently, the Co-In based materials as one of the excellent alternative catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol have received intense attention. Herein, we developed new and efficient Co-In based catalysts (the composite of Co3InC0.75 and In2O3) by Prussian Blue analogues (PBA) pyrolysis. And a series of Co3InC0.75- In2O3 composites with tunable proportion of Co3InC0.75 and In2O3 has been prepared. The experimental results demonstrate the Co3InC0.75-In2O3 catalysts have high catalytic CO2 hydrogenation performance into methanol, reaching a methanol yield up to 0.62 gMeOHgcat � 1h � 1 at 300 degrees C, 5 MPa, 24000 cm3 STPgcat  1h � 1, and H2/CO2 = 3:1, the high reaction stability and air resistance. The synergetic effects between Co3InC0.75 and In2O3 for the enhanced methanol production were confirmed by a series of characterizations, and a positive correlation between methanol production activity and the fraction of Co3InC0.75/In2O3 was well established.

TI Fabricating porous ZnO/Co3O4 microspheres coated
   with N-doped carbon by a simple method as high capacity anode
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In this work, porous ZnO/Co3O4 microspheres coated with N-doped carbon layer (ZnO/Co3O4-NC) are synthesized as high capacity anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) by a simple method. Firstly, a simple one-step strategy is explored for fabricating Prussian blue analogues which replaced the two-step time-consuming cation exchange method to obtain porous ZnO/Co(3)O(4 )microspheres. Then the ZnO/Co3O4 microspheres are coated with N-doped carbon layer to form ZnO/Co3O4-NC. Compared with other traditional Zn and Co based anode materials, the porous structure of the material not only provides large space for volume change but also shortens the transport length for Li+ ions. Meanwhile N-doped carbon increases active sites and improves conductivity of the electrode materials. Beneficial from these advantages, ZnO/Co3O4-NC shows an advanced capacity of 750 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles at 500 mA g(-1). This method is simple to enhance the electrochemical performance of ZnO, which would be applied in preparing other transition metal oxides (TMOs) composites for LIBs or other fields.

TI Structural evolution of a metal-organic framework and derived hybrids
   composed of metallic cobalt and copper encapsulated in nitrogen-doped
   porous carbon cubes with high catalytic performance
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB We present here the structural evolution of a Prussian blue analogue Cu-3(II)[Co-III(CN)(6)](2) (Cu-Co PBA) controlled by sodium citrate as a function of time at room temperature. We identified the different stages of Cu-Co PBA formation and elucidated its transformation kinetics. Moreover, 3D hybrid composites of nitrogen-doped porous carbon cubes, with cobalt and copper nanoparticles embedded within the well-graphitized shells, were rationally fabricated using Cu-Co PBA as the single precursor. The resulting Cu/Co@NPCC catalysts showed superior catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. Metallic cobalt and copper cores were leached out by FeCl3 and HCl treatment to determine the catalytically active sites. Results showed that the nitrogen-doped porous carbon still exhibited excellent catalytic performance after the metallic cores were removed. Based on the experimental results, we speculate that the unique structure of metal residues encapsulated inside the graphitic carbon layers may have higher catalytic activity than the metal particles themselves.

TI A Comprehensive Review on Strategies for Enhancing the Performance of
   Polyanionic-Based Sodium-Ion Battery Cathodes
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The significant consumption of fossil fuels and the increasing pollution have spurred the development of energy-storage devices like batteries. Due to their high cost and limited resources, widely used lithium-ion batteries have become unsuitable for large-scale energy production. Sodium is considered to be one of the most promising substitutes for lithium due to its wide availability and similar physiochemical properties. Designing a suitable cathode material for sodium-ion batteries is essential, as the overall electrochemical performance and the cost of battery depend on the cathode material. Among different types of cathode materials, polyanionic material has emerged as a great option due to its higher redox potential, stable crystal structure, and open three-dimensional framework. However, the poor electronic and ionic conductivity limits their applicability. This review briefly discusses the strategies to deal with the challenges of transition-metal oxides and Prussian blue analogue, recent developments in polyanionic compounds, and strategies to improve electrochemical performance of polyanionic material by nanostructuring, surface coating, morphology control, and heteroatom doping, which is expected to accelerate the future design of sodium-ion battery cathodes.

TI Anion electrostatic insertion boosts efficient zinc ferrocyanide cathode
   for aqueous dual-ion battery
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been considered as a kind of promising cathode materials, but its poor cycle performance severely hinders their industrialization. Herein, by combining a zinc ferrocyanide (ZnHCF) cathode with aqueous ZnSO4/LiTFSI electrolyte and zinc metal anode, we achieved a stable anion insertion-type aqueous dual-ion battery (DIB) which displays a discharge specific capacity of 75.9 mAh g-1, an energy density of 124 Wh kg-1, and a discharge plateau of 1.8 V at 5 A g-1. Its specific capacity can still reach 57.4 mAh g-1 after 1200 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 97 %. A reversible anion insertion mechanism of ZnHCF cathode based on the changes of the valency of iron and the insertion of TFSI- ion on crystal surface caused by electrostatic interaction is proposed and confirmed with a series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations (DFT). This work proposes the study of anion energy storage mechanism of PBAs and brings more opportunities for their large-scale applications in the future.

TI In-situ formation of MOF derived mesoporous
   Co3N/amorphous N-doped carbon nanocubes as an efficient
   electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB The suitable materials, metal nitrides, are a promising class of electrocatalyst materials for a highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because they exhibit superior intrinsic conductivity and have higher sustainability than oxide-based materials. To our knowledge, for the first time, we report a designable synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) and mesoporous Co3N@amorphous N-doped carbon (AN-C) nanocubes (NCs) with well-controlled open-framework structures via monodispersed Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) Prussian blue analogue (PBA) NC precursors using in situ nitridation and calcination processes. Co3N@AN-C NCs (2 h) demonstrate better OER activity with a remarkably low Tafel plot (69.6 mV.dec(-1)), low overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). Additionally, excellent cycling stability in alkaline electrolytes was exhibited without morphological changes and voltage elevations, superior to most reported hierarchical structures of transition-metal nitride particles. The presented strategy for synergy effects of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived transition-metal nitrides-carbon hybrid nanostructures provides prospects for developing high-performance and advanced electrocatalyst materials.

TI Vibrational properties and bonding analysis of copper hexacyanoferrate
   complexes in solid state
SO APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY REVIEWS
AB Vibrational spectroscopic study of crystalline copper hexacyanoferrate complexes of composition K4Cu6II [Fe-II(CN)(6)](4)nH(2)O (1) and Cu-6(II)[Fe-III(CN)(6)](4)nH(2)O (2) with -Cu-N equivalent to C-Fe- bridging structures have been performed. The cubic Fmm (O-h(5)) unit-cells contain ideally 4 Fe and 4 Cu ions which were calculated by periodic density functional theory (DFT) (using the Gaussian09 C.01 software package) for ideal lattice compositions of K8Cu4II[Fe-II(CN)(6)](4) (1a), K4Cu4II[Fe-III(CN)(6)](4) (2a) and with lattice water molecules KCu4II[Fe-III(CN)(6)](3)6H(2)O (3a). Systematically, non-linear Cu-N equivalent to C structure was fitted with Cu-N equivalent to C bond angles about 155 degrees for complexes 1a, 2a, and 3a. Practically, all optically active internal modes of Fe(CN6)(n-) moieties resulted from factor group analysis as 4A(1g) + 6E(g) + 4F(1g) + 10F(1u) were experimentally observed and assigned. Some low-frequency translatory and librational modes were also interpreted. Vibrational bands were assigned to cis- and trans-Cu(NC)(4)(OH2) complexes which are formed in the lattice holes of both complexes. Vibrational spectra and force constants of a great number of transition metal hexacyano complexes of compositions K-4[M-II(CN)(6)], K-3[M-III(CN)(6)], CsLi2[M-III(CN)(6)] and Prussian blue analogues have been reexamined and recalculated. Internal and external modes of 6 different lattice water species (coordinated, hydrogen bonded, or zeolitic type) have been interpreted for complex 2 using results of periodic DFT calculation of model complex 3a.

TI Manganese-cobalt hexacyanoferrate cathodes for sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) have shown promise as electrode materials for grid-scale batteries because of their high cycle life and rapid kinetics in aqueous-based electrolytes. However, these materials suffer from relatively low specific capacity, which may limit their practical applications. Here, we investigate strategies to improve the specific capacity of these materials while maintaining their cycling stability and elucidate mechanisms that enhance their electrochemical properties. In particular, we have studied the electrochemical and structural properties of manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCFe) and cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCFe) in an aqueous, sodium-ion electrolyte. We also studied manganese-cobalt hexacyanoferrate (Mn-CoHCFe) solid solutions with different Mn/Co ratios that combine properties of both MnHCFe and CoHCFe. The materials have the characteristic open-framework crystal structure of PBAs, and their specific capacities can be significantly improved by electrochemically cycling (oxidizing and reducing) both the carbon-coordinated Fe and the nitrogen-coordinated Co or Mn ions. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies and ex situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with an in-depth electrochemical characterization provide insight into the different electrochemical properties associated with the Fe, Co, and Mn redox couples. We show that cycling the C-coordinated Fe preserves the crystal structure and enables the outstanding kinetics and cycle life previously displayed by PBAs in aqueous electrolytes. On the other hand, the N-coordinated Co and Mn ions exhibit a slower kinetic regime due to structural distortions resulting from the weak N-coordinated crystal field, but they still contribute significantly towards increasing the specific capacity of the materials. These results provide the understanding needed to drive future development of PBAs for grid-scale applications that require extremely high cycle life and kinetics.

TI Ultrafine manganese hexacyanoferrate with low defects regulated by
   potassium polyacrylate for high-performance aqueous Zn-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) is an ideal candidate for aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their high capacity and high operating voltage. Adding surfactant during the preparation process is an effective way to reduce the [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and water, leading to a stable structure and excellent electrochemical performance. However, the size of MnHCF becomes large (> 100 nm) after adding surfactant, resulting in the sluggish kinetics of Zn-ion transport and low utilization rate of active materials. Herein, ultrafine MnHCF (15 nm) (MnHCF-15) with few vacancies and low water content has been fabricated by introducing a typical surfactant of potassium polyacrylate (PAA-K). Moreover, PAA-K can also precisely regulate the size of MnHCF, which exhibit a series of nano-sizes of 15, 50, 80, and 120 nm. The MnHCF-15 cathode exhibited a high capacity of 139.2 mA h g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 with a high operating voltage of 1.75 V. The excellent cycling stability of 92.5 %, 91.9 %, and 84.5 % capacity retention at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 A g-1 for 1000 cycles were also achieved because of the ultrafine size and the low defect of MnHCF-15. Ex-situ XRD and XPS were carried out to probe Zn-ion storage mechanism, indicating a reversible electrochemical reaction of the MnHCF-15 cathode. Impressively, the soft-packed AZIBs with high electrochemical performance highly reveal the practical application of the MnHCF-15. The results of this work offer a promising cathode material and lead to a new understanding on the nano-size effect of PBAs in AZIBs.

TI Harnessing the Benefits of PEDOT : PSS Conductive Coating for Prolonged
   Cycle Life of Copper Hexacyanoferrate in Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries
SO BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS
AB The utilization of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) as positive electrode material in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) has gained significant attention due to its efficient (de-)intercalation of Zn2+ ions, cost-effective synthesis, low toxicity, and high working potential. One approach to improve its electrochemical performance is to coat the CuHCF particles with conductive polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT : PSS). In this study, we investigated the impact of the PEDOT : PSS as a coating on the electrochemical behavior and the cycle life of CuHCF for aqueous ZIB applications. Galvanostatic cycling performed at a current rate of 1 C relevant for the stationary application of the CuHCF/PEDOT : PSS electrodes having high mass loadings (10 mg cm(-2) of active material) revealed significantly longer cycle life while maintaining a high Coulombic efficiency (>= 99.5 %). The longest cycle life was achieved with CuHCF coated using a 4.5 wt. % PEDOT : PSS aqueous coating dispersion. These findings demonstrate the potential of conductive polymer coatings as a practical approach to enhance the electrochemical performance of positive electrode materials in aqueous Zinc-ion batteries.

TI Flexible needle-type Microbiosensor for real-time monitoring traditional
   acupuncture-mediated adenosine release In vivo
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB Rapid adenosine (ADO) signaling, on the time frame of seconds, regulates physiological and pathological pro-cesses, including the therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture. Nevertheless, standard monitoring strategies are limited by poor temporal resolution. Herein, an implantable needle-type microsensor capable of monitoring ADO release in vivo in response to acupuncture in real time has been developed. Electrocatalytic Prussian Blue nanoparticles, an immobilized multienzyme system, and a permselective poly-o-phenylenediamine-based membrane were used for the sequential modification of the sensing region of the electrode. The resultant sensor can perform amperometric measurements of ADO levels in response to a very low level of applied po-tential (-0.05 V vs Ag/AgCl). This microsensor also functioned across a broad linear range (0-50 mu M) and exhibited good sensitivity (1.1 nA/mu M) with a rapid response time of under 5 s. Importantly, the sensor also exhibited good reproducibility and high selectivity. For in vivo animal studies, the microsensor was employed for the continuous assessment of instantaneous ADO release at the ST36 (Zusanli) acupoint when this acupoint was subjected to twirling-rotating acupuncture manipulation. Benefiting from superior sensor in vivo performance and stability, the positive correlation between the variability in acupuncture-induced ADO release and the stimulus intensity levels that affect the clinical benefit can be demonstrated for the first time. Overall, these results highlight a powerful approach to analyzing the in vivo physiological effects of acupuncture, expanding application realm of micro-nano sensor technology on a fast time scale.

TI A new {Fe4Co4} soluble switchable nanomagnet
   encapsulating Cs<SUP>+</SUP>: enhancing the stability and redox
   flexibility and tuning the photomagnetic effect
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB We report a new cyanide-bridged CsC{Fe4Co4} box, a soluble model of photomagnetic Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The Cs+ ion has a high affinity for the box and can replace the K+ ion in the preformed K-cube. This exchange is kinetically impeded at room temperature but is accelerated by heating and using the 18-crown-6 ether. The inserted Cs+ ion confers a high robustness to the cube, which withstands boiling, as shown by variable-temperature NMR studies. The stability of this model complex in solution allows the probing of the electronic interaction between the alkali ion and the cyanide cage by using various techniques. These interactions are known to play a role in the photomagnetic behaviour of PBAs. Firstly, the Cs-133 NMR spectroscopy proves that there is an electronic communication between the encapsulated alkali ion and the cyanide cage. The measured up-field signal, observed at ca. -200 ppm at 300 K, reveals that a certain amount of spin density is transferred through the bonds from the paramagnetic Co(II) ion to the encapsulated cation. Secondly, cyclovoltammetric studies show that the nature of the inserted ions affects the redox properties of the cage and influences the electronic communication between the metal ions. However, the differences in the electrochemical properties of the K-cube and the Cs-cube remain moderate. As the switching properties are influenced by the redox potential of the Fe and Co centers, similar photomagnetic behaviour is observed, with both of them being highly photomagnetic. This result contrasts strikingly with previous studies on the 3D polymeric PBAs, where the PBAs with a high amount of Cs+ show poor photomagnetic behaviour. In that case, cooperative behaviour likely influences the switching properties. Finally, EPR spectroscopy shows that the K-cube is more anisotropic than the Cs-cube. This difference is reflected in the changes occurring in the slow magnetic relaxation (single molecule magnet behaviour) observed in the two cubes.

TI Oriented proton-conductive nano-sponge-facilitated polymer electrolyte
   membranes
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Achieving high power output from proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) requires efficient proton transport in proton exchange membranes (PEMs). Since proton conductivity is closely related to membrane moisture content, operation at low relative humidity (RH) and elevated temperature has become a critical bottleneck for the practical application of PEMFCs due to severe PEM dehydration. While several strategies have sought to mitigate this, including external thermal and water management, coating of nano-cracked hydrophobic layers and optimization of membrane intrinsic water retention, only partial improvements have been realized. Here, using a membrane formulation of ferrocyano-coordinated poly(4-vinylpyridine) (CP4VP), phosphotungstic acid (PWA) and polysulfone (PSf), novel highly water-retentive PEMs are fabricated via a strong magnetic field. During magnetic-assisted membrane casting, CP4VP and PWA form a microporous Prussian blue analogue (PBA) framework with the new type of Fe-C equivalent to N-W bonding, which is paramagnetic and is thus simultaneously aligned in the through-plane (TP) direction of the membrane. The neutral PSf membrane component affords mechanical strength to the embedded TP-aligned conducting channels. This new type of microporous PBA framework is highly hydrophilic and proton conductive, with micropores of similar to 5.4 angstrom diameter, which act as nano-sponges to absorb only more retentive non-freezable water, effective for proton conduction. These nano-sponges display efficient water absorption and retention at low RH and elevated temperatures, together with a much faster hydration process than the dehydration process. Furthermore, the TP-aligned PBA channels also enable faster water transport to promote PEM proton conduction beyond any previously reported water-retentive membrane. Consequently, the novel nano-sponge-like PEMs exhibit remarkable performance in both ex situ and in situ evaluations, especially at low RH and elevated temperature, largely prevailing over the commercial benchmark Nafion (R) 212.

TI Unveiling the adsorption behavior and mass transfer mechanism of Rb plus
   and Cs plus adsorption on FeMn-MOF
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The development of efficient adsorbents is essential for utilizing low-grade liquid rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) resources, which is often hindered by unclear adsorption mechanisms. In this study, a metal-organic framework (MOF) adsorbent with a Prussian blue structure, named FeMn-MOF, was designed and synthesized. The FeMnMOF materials were processed into small particles with varying sizes and specific surface areas, and into twodimensional (2D) FeMn-MOF using ball milling and exfoliation methods. Characterization and adsorption experiments demonstrated the excellent adsorption properties of Rb+ and Cs+. The results indicate that the adsorption rate and capacity are significantly influenced by the particle size and specific surface area, wherein smaller particles and 2D FeMn-MOF exhibiting superior performance. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations at the microscopic level revealed that ion exchange occurs at the adsorption interface, which limits the actual adsorption capacity. During the adsorption process, Rb+ and Cs+ undergo partial dehydration from the bulk phase to the adsorption interface; however, even after partial dehydration, the hydrated ions retain a relatively large radius, hindering their entry into the internal framework. This work paves the way for developing advanced adsorbents with large surface areas to enhance adsorption performance, providing valuable insights and a theoretical foundation for the separation and extraction of Rb and Cs resources from salt lakes.

TI Enhancement of the urea oxidation reaction by constructing hierarchical
   CoFe-PBA@S/NiFe-LDH nanoboxes with strengthened built-in electric fields
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) present a major obstacle for efficient hydrogen production via water electrolysis. In contrast, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), with its lower thermodynamic barrier, presents a promising alternative to OER. In this study, we designed and synthesized hierarchical CoFe-PBA@S/NiFe-LDH nanoboxes. Sulfur doping in nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (S/NiFe-LDH) introduces a weak built-in electric field (BIEF), which is further strengthened when combined with cobalt-iron Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) to form a heterojunction. This heterojunction created localized charge polarization at the interface, facilitating efficient electron transfer and reducing the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates, thereby significantly improving intrinsic catalytic activity. Under conditions of 1 M KOH and 0.33 M urea, the CoFe-PBA@S/NiFe-LDH catalyst achieved a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low potential of 1.321 V, accompanied by a low Tafel slope (53 mV dec(-1)). Additionally, it maintained stability at 30 mA cm(-2) for 40 h. This work provides vital insights for the strategic design of highly effective heterojunction catalysts for the UOR.

TI Intercalation Hosts for Multivalent-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL STRUCTURES
AB Among intercalation, alloying, and conversion battery chemistries, the intercalation chemistry is most widely used in commercial applications due to its superior reversibility, round trip efficiency, and stability, albeit at the expense of reduced specific capacity. While intercalation hosts for monovalent ions (e.g., lithium and sodium) are well developed, the jury is still out on the best available intercalation host materials for multivalent ions such as magnesium, zinc, calcium, and aluminum. In multivalent systems, it is challenging to find electrode materials that can act as a durable host, and accommodate large number of ions, while also permitting fast diffusion kinetics. In this perspective, the electrochemical performance of five distinct class of materials (prussian blue analogues, sodium super ionic conductors organic, layered, and open-tunnel oxides) for multivalent ion storage is evaluated. The analysis reveals that open-tunnel oxides show noticeably superior performance in multivalent ion batteries. Herein, the underlying reasons for this are discussed and the case is made for an in-depth machine-learning-driven "materials exploration effort" directed toward discovery of new open-tunneled oxides that could lead to vastly superior multivalent ion batteries.

TI Ni3Fe nanoparticles encapsulated by N-doped carbon derived
   from MOFs for oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB It has been a hot research topic to look for inexpensive alternative oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts to replace noble metal-based materials due to their scarcity. Transition metals are ideal candidates because of their high abundance, impressive activities, and easy accessibility. However, a facile method leading to improved performance and stability is still needed. Herein, a highly efficient carbon-encapsulated bimetal catalyst derived from Ni-based metal-organic-frameworks (MOF) was successfully prepared through the low-temperature (350 degrees C) pyrolysis of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursors under H-2/Ar atmosphere. Cube-structured PBA as template and precursor , parameters during the pyrolysis process including temperature and calcination atmosphere can be tuned to control the structure and properties of the catalysts. Benefiting from the porous three-dimensional (3D) cubic structure and abundant defect-rich amorphous N-doped carbon shell, Ni3Fe@NC-350 exhibits excellent OER activity. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance for OER in 1.0 M KOH with an overpotential of 237 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the presented catalyst has an extremely good durability. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Robust FeCoP nanoparticles grown on a rGO-coated Ni foam as an efficient
   oxygen evolution catalyst for excellent alkaline and seawater
   electrolysis
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Electrochemical water splitting is a potential green hydrogen energy generation technique. With the shortage of fresh water, abundant seawater resources should be developed as the main raw material for water electrolysis. However, since the precipitation reaction of chloride ions in seawater will compete with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and corrode the catalyst, seawater electrolysis is restricted by the decrease in activity, low stability, and selectivity. Rational design and development of efficient and stable catalysts is the key to seawater electrolysis. Herein, a high-activity bimetallic phosphide FeCoP, grown on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-protected Ni Foam (NF) substrate using FeCo Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA) as a template, was designed for application in alkaline natural seawater electrolysis. The OER activity confirmed that the formed FeCoP@rGO/NF has high electrocatalytic performance. In 1 M KOH and natural alkaline seawater, the overpotential was only 257 mV and 282 mV under 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. It also demonstrated long-term stability up to 200 h. Therefore, this study provides new insight into the application of PBA as a precursor of bimetallic phosphide in the electrolysis of seawater at high current density.

TI Co-Construction of Solid Solution Phase and Void Space in Yolk-Shell
   Fe0.4Co0.6S@N-Doped Carbon to Enhance Cycling
   Capacity and Rate Capability for Aluminum-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs), using low-cost and inherent safety Al metal anodes, are regarded as promising energy storage devices next to lithium-ion batteries. Currently, one of the greatest challenges for AIBs is to explore cathodes suitable for feasible Al3+ insertion/extraction with high structure stability. Herein, a facile co-engineering on solid solution phase and cavity structure is developed via Prussian blue analogues by a simple and facile sulfidation strategy. The obtained uniform yolk-shell Fe0.4Co0.6S@N-doped carbon nanocages (y-s Fe0.4Co0.6S@NC) display a high reversible capacity of 141.3 mA h g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles and a good rate capability of 100.9 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1). The improved performance can be mainly ascribed to the dual merits of the composite; that is, more negative Al3+ formation energy and improved Al3+ diffusion kinetics favored by the solid solution phase and Al3+ insertion/extraction accommodable space stemmed from the yolk-shell structure. Moreover, the reaction mechanism study discloses that the reaction involves the intercalation of Al3+ ions into Fe0.4Co0.6S to generate AllFemConS and elemental Fe and Co.

TI PdCo/Pd-Hexacyanocobaltate Hybrid Nanoflowers: Cyanogel-Bridged One-Pot
   Synthesis and Their Enhanced Catalytic Performance
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Elaborate architectural manipulation of nanohybrids with multi-components into controllable 3D hierarchical structures is of great significance for both fundamental scientific interest and realization of various functionalities, yet remains a great challenge because different materials with distinct physical/chemical properties could hardly be incorporated simultaneously into the synthesis process. Here, we develop a novel one-pot cyanogel-bridged synthetic approach for the generation of 3D flower-like metal/Prussian blue analogue nanohybrids, namely PdCo/Pd-hexacyanocobaltate for the first time. The judicious introduction of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the formation of cyanogel are prerequisite for the successful fabrication of such fascinating hierarchical nanostructures. Due to the unique 3D hierarchical structure and the synergistic effect between hybrid components, the as-prepared hybrid nanoflowers exhibit a remarkable catalytic activity and durability toward the reduction of Rhodamine B (RhB) by NaBH4. We expect that the obtained hybrid nanoflowers may hold great promises in water remediation field and beyond. Furthermore, the facile synthetic strategy presented here for synthesizing functional hybrid materials can be extendable for the synthesis of various functional hybrid nanomaterials owing to its versatility and feasibility.

TI Weakly Solvating Effect Spawning Reliable Interfacial Chemistry for
   Aqueous Zn/Na Hybrid Batteries
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The insufficient exploration of the interfacial chemistry of Zn anodes and electrolytes in an aqueous environment restricts the application potential of aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). Herein, a durable anion-derived solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with high ion conduction properties is constructed by designing an aqueous electrolyte with a weakly solvating effect to manipulate the solvation structure of metal ions (Zn2+/Na+). The constructed SEI significantly restrains the dendrite formation and occurrence of adverse reactions on the surface of the Zn anode, endowing the Zn metal anode with high reversibility of deposition/stripping and ultra-long lifespan over 5000 h with an exceptional cumulative capacity of over 2.5 Ah cm(-2). Significantly, the formation mechanism of the SEI, which is realized by the weakly solvating effect to promote the coordination between anions and metal ions (Zn2+/Na+), and the composition distribution of anion-derived inorganic-rich SEI, are clarified in detail. Furthermore, benefiting from the synergy of the elaborate SEI and the regulated electrolyte environment, the Zn//Prussian blue analogue (PBA) full battery can operate with a high voltage platform of 2.1 V and deliver 99.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles.

TI Insight on the active sites of CoNi alloy embedded in N-doped carbon
   nanotubes for oxygen reduction reaction
SO SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS
AB Transition metal alloy electrocatalysts have sparked intense interest for their use in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, there is almost no corresponding research on the alloy active sites. In this study, CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded in bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (CoNi-NCTs) as catalysts constructed by a facile pyrolysis of Prussian blue analogs were investigated. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the oxygen molecules are more easily adsorbed on the Ni sites in these catalysts, while the Co sites favor the formation of OOH* intermediates during ORR. In addition, the cooperation of the CoNi alloys with the N-doped carbon benefits electron transfer and promotes electrocatalytic activity. The optimized CoNi-NCT shows remarkable ORR catalytic activity with an half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.83 V, an onset potential (E-onset) of 0.97 V, and superior durability, all of which surpass the commercial Pt/C catalysts. The assembled zinc-air battery delivers a small charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.86 V at 10 mA cm(-2), a high-power density of 167 mW cm(-2), and good stability (running stably over 900 cycles).

TI A 3D-Printed Proton Pseudocapacitor with Ultrahigh Mass Loading and
   Areal Energy Density for Fast Energy Storage at Low Temperature
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The sluggish ionic transport in thick electrodes and freezing electrolytes has limited electrochemical energy storage devices in lots of harsh environments for practical applications. Here, a 3D-printed proton pseudocapacitor based on high-mass-loading 3D-printed WO3 anodes, Prussian blue analog cathodes, and anti-freezing electrolytes is developed, which can achieve state-of-the-art electrochemical performance at low temperatures. Benefiting from the cross-scale 3D electrode structure using a 3D printing direct ink writing technique, the 3D-printed cathode realizes an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.39 F cm(-2) at a high areal mass loading of 23.51 mg cm(-2). Moreover, the 3D-printed pseudocapacitor delivers an areal capacitance of 3.44 F cm(-2) and excellent areal energy density (1.08 mWh cm(-2)). Owing to the fast ion kinetics in 3D electrodes and the high ionic conductivity of the hybrid electrolyte, the 3D-printed supercapacitor delivers 61.3% of the room-temperature capacitance even at -60 degrees C. This work provides an effective strategy for the practical applications of energy storage devices with complex physical structure at extreme temperatures.

TI Potassium-based electrochemical energy storage devices: Development
   status and future prospect
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB The demand for large energy storage systems is consecutively increasing, which requires low-cost and renewable batteries technologies with sustainable performance. Potassium, as the nearest element to sodium and lithium in the IA group of the periodic table, possesses excellent superiorities in electrochemical energy storage devices. Correspondingly, numerous electrode materials with excellent stability and capability have been developed for rechargeable potassium-ion batteries (KIBs). In this review, recent results of electrode materials concerning different types of electrolytes (organic electrolyte, aqueous electrolyte, and all-solid-state electrolyte) for rechargeable KIBs are summarized. An overall content of ongoing cathode/anode electrode materials utilized in rechargeable KIBs with organic electrolyte is reviewed. The topic focuses on employing organic compounds, Prussian blue analogues, layered oxides, and polyanionic compounds as cathode. In addition, different anode materials such as intercalation compounds, alloy compounds, conversion compounds, and organic compounds were discussed. Furthermore, the current research progress of other potassium-based electrochemical energy storage devices (KEES) with low costs and high specific energy densities, such as potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (KIHCs) and potassium dual-ion batteries (KDIBs), are also summarized. Finally, we pointed out the current challenges and future directions of KEES.

TI A General Strategy for Synthesis of Binary Transition Metal Phosphides
   Hollow Sandwich Heterostructures
SO SMALL
AB The hollow sandwich core-shell micro-nanomaterials are widely used in materials, chemistry, and medicine, but their fabrication, particularly for transition metal phosphides (TMPs), remains a great challenge. Herein, a general synthesis strategy is presented for binary TMPs hollow sandwich heterostructures with vertically interconnected nanosheets on the inside and outside surfaces of polyhedron FeCoPx/C, demonstrated by a variety of transition metals (including Co, Fe, Cd, Mn, Cu, Cr, and Ni). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals the process and universal mechanism of layered double hydroxide (LDH) growth on Prussian blue analog (PBA) surface in detail for the first time, which provides the theoretical foundations for feasibility and rationality of the synthesis strategy. This unique structure exhibits a vertical nanosheet-shell-vertical nanosheet configuration combining the advantages of sandwich, hollow and vertical heterostructures, effectively achieving their synergistic effect. As a proof-of-concept of their applications, the CoNiPx@FeCoPx/C@CoNiPx hollow sandwich polyhedron architectures (representative samples) show excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. This work provides a general method for constructing hollow-sandwich micro-nanostructures, which provides more ideas and directions for design of micro-nano materials with special geometric topology.

TI Heterogeneous electro-Fenton catalysis with novel bimetallic CoFeC
   electrode
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Electro-Fenton (EF) is considered to be an effective water treatment technology for the purification of organic wastewater. However, the complicated and unfriendly process hinder the development of bimetallic electrodes in EF system. In this work, the novel bimetallic electrode (CoFeC) derived from Fe, Co-based prussian blue analogue (PBA) was synthesized by simple liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) method and pyrolysis treatment, and applied to EF degradation of ornidazole (ONZ). Significantly, the prepared CoFeC electrode exhibited superior degradation efficiency for almost complete removal of 50 mg/L ONZ in 120 min with optimal mineralization current efficiency (MCE) and energy consumption (EC). The stability of electrode was greatly improved, still maintaining above 90 % removal even after 10 cycles of degradation experiment. The results of mechanism exploration show that ONZ was removed via three degradation paths under the attack of the center dot OH and SO4 center dot-. Remarkably, the biotoxicity assessment of degraded intermediates analyzed by ECOSAR and T.E.S.T software indicated the environmentally friendly features of the EF degradation process. This work offers a green and efficient EF system using active bimetallic electrode, which has a broad application prospect in the field of watertreatment for organic wastewater.

TI Accelerating the water splitting kinetics of CoP microcubes anchored on
   a graphene electrocatalyst by Mn incorporation
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB CoP is considered as an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic electrolytes but its performance in alkaline solutions is generally poor because of its slow reaction kinetics, which further limits its application in overall water splitting. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to greatly accelerate its HER and OER kinetics in alkaline solutions through Mn incorporation. Ternary MnxCo1-xP microcubes with a tunable Mn/Co ratio strongly anchored on rGO were synthesized using Prussian blue analogues as precursors. The synergy between the high activity of MnxCo1-xP microcubes and the good conductivity of rGO leads to the superior performance of the hybrid toward water splitting in 1 M KOH. The optimized Mn0.6Co0.4P-rGO electrocatalyst shows high activity and stability towards both the HER and OER with low overpotentials of 54 and 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the water electrolyzer using Mn0.6Co0.4P-rGO as both the cathode and anode only requires a cell voltage as low as 1.55 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), making Mn(0.6)Co(0.4)PrGO a competitive and cost-effective electrocatalyst for water splitting.

TI Reduced Fe, Mn-based catalyst with dual reaction sites for rapid
   decolorization treatment via Fenton-like reactions
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Ferromanganese oxides are promising efficient catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. In this study, a novel porous ferromanganese oxides (FeMnOx) nanocubes derived from prussian blue analogues was prepared via a successive codeposition-calcination method, and the reduced Fe, Mn-based catalysts were further synthe-sized by a hydrogenation process. Their catalytic performance was evaluated in a Fenton-like degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and other dyes in the presence of PMS. It was found that FeMnOx showed outstanding catalytic activity in dyes elimination, which benefited by the synergetic effect of dual reaction sites, reductive Fe-Mn binary oxides and oxygen vacancies (OVs) for PMS activation. The optimized sample (H2 annealed at 260 degrees C, FMO-260) exhibited high degradation efficiency to RhB within 5 cycles and after regeneration, implying the strong stability and reusability. Moreover, the influences of PMS and FMO-260 dosages, pH values, coexist anions for the degradation efficiency to RhB were also carried out. According to inhibitor experiments and EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) tests, a possible catalytic mechanism and degradation pathway of RhB was proposed. This study provides a novel fabrication strategy to design Fe, Mn-based catalysts and demonstrates more po-tential in the decolorization field.

TI Active material and interphase structures governing performance in
   sodium and potassium ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Development of energy storage systems is a topic of broad societal and economic relevance, and lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the most advanced electrochemical energy storage systems. However, concerns on the scarcity of lithium sources and consequently the expected price increase have driven the development of alternative energy storage systems beyond LIBs. In the search for sustainable and cost-effective technologies, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium ion batteries (PIBs) have attracted considerable attention. Here, a comprehensive review of ongoing studies on electrode materials for SIBs and PIBs is provided in comparison to those for LIBs, which include layered oxides, polyanion compounds and Prussian blue analogues for positive electrode materials, and carbon-based and alloy materials for negative electrode materials. The importance of the crystal structure for electrode materials is discussed with an emphasis placed on intrinsic and dynamic structural properties and electrochemistry associated with alkali metal ions. The key challenges for electrode materials as well as the interface/interphase between the electrolyte and electrode materials, and the corresponding strategies are also examined. The discussion and insights presented in this review can serve as a guide regarding where future investigations of SIBs and PIBs will be directed.

TI Preparation and Catalytic Performance of
   Co-Co9S8/N-Doped Ketjen Black Composite for Oxygen
   Reduction Reaction
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Co-Co9S8/N-KB composite catalyst supported by high conductivity carbon (nitrogen doped Ketjen black) and introduced by single metal for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was prepared using Prussian blue analogue as precursor through high temperature annealing technology. By comparison of different annealing temperatures, it is found that the catalyst gained at the annealing temperature of 800 C degrees showed the best catalytic activity for ORR. The initial potential and half-wave potential were 0.93 and 0.83 V respectively, comparable to commercial Pt/C, and the limit current density reached 5.7 mA.cm(-2), higher than that of Pt/C. After a long period of 10 000 s for chronoamperometry experiment, the current density still retained at 95.6% of the initial, and the half-wave potential shifted just only 8.6 mV after 5 000 cycles subjected in a range of 0.5 to 1.0 V (vs RHE) during the accelerated durability test. In addition, in actual Al-air full battery applications, the discharge platform of Co-Co9S8/N-KB reached 1.53 V at a discharge density of 50 mA.cm(-2), higher than that of Pt/C.

TI Developing Binder-Free Electrode Based on Metal-Organic Frameworks and
   Graphene Hydrogel for Electrochemical Energy Storage
SO ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
AB As a kind of metal-organic framework (MOF), Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) with open channel structure and adjustable composition have been widely used in alkali metal batteries. However, using PB and PBAs as electrode materials for supercapacitors directly is very rare, and most of them are prepared as derivatives for supercapacitor. Herein, a hybrid configuration of nickel-cobalt hexacyanoferrate (NiCoHCF)/graphene hydrogels (denoted as NCFG) is successfully prepared via a facile coprecipitation method combined with a hydrothermal process. The highly interconnected integrated 3D network structure not only compensates the conductivity of NiCoHCF, but can also be directly applied as both anode and cathode for a symmetric supercapacitor without adding conductive agent and binder, due to excellent mechanical robustness. The as-prepared NCFG nanocomposite delivers a high specific capacitance of 321 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) in 1 m Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the assembled NCFG//NCFG symmetric supercapacitor exhibits a wide voltage window of 2.0 V with a high energy density of 41.6 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 1 kW kg(-1). This work has reference significance for directly using MOFs as electrode materials for supercapacitors.

TI In-situ fabrication of Ni<SUP>2+</SUP>/Zn<SUP>2+</SUP>-polydopamine
   complex derived FeCo@C/Ni@C cubic nanocages towards enhanced
   electromagnetic performance
SO ADVANCED COMPOSITES AND HYBRID MATERIALS
AB The quest for broadband electromagnetic wave absorption to satisfy the demands of various fields has emerged as a prominent research focus in the domain of electromagnetic wave absorption. By considering the effects of magnetic loss and polarization loss across different frequency bands, the development of composite materials incorporating magnetic metal particles and single metal atoms may facilitate an expansion of the electromagnetic wave absorption frequency range. Consequently, we synthesized FeCo@C/Ni@C composites derived from FeCo Prussian blue analogues and polydopamine through wet chemistry and pyrolysis methods. The chelation mechanism of polydopamine, combined with the physical barrier effect provided by Zn ions during synthesis, endows the FeCo@C/Ni@C composite with low-frequency magnetic loss characteristics from the FeCo alloy, high-frequency dipole polarization losses attributed to Ni atoms, and conductivity losses arising from the coupled carbon matrix. Ultimately, the composite exhibits exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption performance: at a thickness of 2.26 mm, it achieves a minimum reflection loss value of - 50.1 dB along with an effective absorption bandwidth reaching up to 6.0 GHz. In summary, this work presents a novel strategy for enhancing broadband absorption capabilities in electromagnetic wave absorbing materials.

TI Formation of Carbon-Incorporated NiO@Co3O4 Nanostructures via a Direct
   Calcination Method and Their Application as Battery-Type Electrodes for
   Supercapacitors
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Nickel and cobalt oxides are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors, but their poor conductivity and sluggish kinetics seriously hinder their application. Herein, a simple one-step calcination method was proposed to prepare carbon incorporated NiO@Co3O4 (denoted as CNC) using a NiCo Prussian blue analogue (NiCo-PBA) as a precursor. The effect of calcination temperature on the electrochemical behavior of CNC was investigated. Benefiting from the relatively large specific surface area and porous structure characteristics, when used as an electrode for supercapacitors, the CNC obtained at 400 degrees C shows the typical features of a battery-type electrode, with a good specific capacitance of 208.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a rate capability of 70.8% at 30 A g-1. The hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) constructed with the optimum CNC electrode can provide a high energy density of 32.6 Wh kg-1 at the corresponding power density of 750.0 W kg-1 and an excellent cycling stability of 87.1% over 5000 cycles. This study provides a simple calcination method for preparing MOF-derived high-conductivity mixed metal oxide electrode materials for supercapacitors.

TI Ternary MnO/CoMn alloy@N-doped graphitic composites derived from a

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Developing a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains significant for metal-air battery progress. Among all candidates, non-precious transition metal composite materials with the appropriate components and nanostructures are promising for the ORR and OER. Herein, a composite comprising a CoMn alloy coated with N-doped carbon and MnO is synthesized by a facile strategy involving the annealing of a Prussian blue analogue. The derived heterogeneous composite includes the benefits of a CoMn alloy, N-doped carbon and MnO, giving a low onset potential (0.91 V), positive half-wave potential (0.76 V) and large limiting current density (5.8 mA cm 2). The enhanced ORR activity can be attributed to the optimal surface electronic configuration of the alloy, which facilitates intermediate dissociation, in combination with heterojunctions, which favor charge transfer from the alloy and oxide. In addition, the electrocatalyst displays promising activity for the OER with an onset potential of 1.53 V and a low potential of 1.65 V at 10 mA cm 2, highlighting its prospect as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst.

TI Porous hollow CoInOx nanocubes as a highly efficient catalyst for the
   catalytic combustion of toluene
SO NANOSCALE
AB Porous hollow HC-CoInOx nanocubes were synthesized via a SiO2 template strategy involving a cobalt-based metal-organic framework derived from a Prussian Blue analogue. As a heterogeneous catalytic material for the catalytic combustion of toluene, the hollow HC-CoInOx nanocubes displayed superior catalytic performance (T-90 = 178 degrees C) and greatly reduced the activation energy for toluene oxidation due to their large surface area, the formation of surface dangling bands and oxygen vacancies, and increased number of weak acid sites. In comparison, the C-CoInOx sample (without the introduction of a SiO2 template) required a higher reaction temperature to achieve the same conversion of toluene (T-90 = 345 degrees C). Especially, the insertion and coating of SiO2 in CoIn-PBA nanocubes greatly improves their thermal stability, and the nanocubic shape of the porous hollow HC-CoInOx sample can remain intact after roasting at 450 degrees C, while the nanocubic shape of the C-CoInOx sample without the introduction of SiO2 is partially damaged and suffers from serious aggregation under the same firing conditions. Simultaneously, the porous hollow HC-CoInOx nanocubes also exhibited excellent cycling and thermal stability for the catalytic combustion of toluene to CO2 and H2O.

TI Rocking-chair capacitive deionization for phosphate recovery via
   rejection mode using ion-exchange membranes
SO DESALINATION
AB Rocking-chair capacitive deionization (CDI), in combination with commercially available ion-exchange membranes, was evaluated for the feasibility of recovering phosphate. Here, contrary to the typical ion-selective adsorption methods in CDI, we aim to isolate and recover phosphate via a rejection mode. We have successfully removed 80 % of chloride from a binary solution containing equimolar concentrations of chloride and monovalent phosphate, while retaining virtually 100 % of phosphate. Further studies have revealed that & GE;90 % of chloride can be removed while sacrificing as little as 15-20 % of the original phosphate concentration. To optimize the electrochemical ion separation process, we have studied several different working potentials, flowrates, and cycle times in these experiments. Moreover, we have observed similar selectivity results for both carbon-based and intercalation electrodes (Prussian blue analogues, PBAs) in a direct comparison. Within the constraints of the testing parameters, both systems exhibit no pronounced differences, with PBAs marginally outperforming carbon-based electrodes in terms of total chloride removed (94 % vs. 92 %). However, during the early stages of a desalination run, the carbon-based system revealed a minor edge on the ion separation performance compared to the PBA system.

TI The application of the inexpensive and synthetically simple
   electrocatalyst CuFe-MoC@NG in immunosensors
SO ANALYST
AB In this study, we used inexpensive and synthetically simple electrocatalysts as replacements for conventional precious metal materials to reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We for the first time developed N-doped graphene-coated CuFe@MoC using one-step calcination of binary Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with Mo6+ cationic grafting precursors. The synergistic interaction of CuFe PBA and MoC increased the catalytically active sites for H2O2 reduction. The catalyst was optimized in terms of the ratio of CuFe PBA to Mo6+, PVP content, and calcination temperature to improve its catalytic activity. When it was used to construct an electrochemical immunosensor for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection, polydopamine (CuFe-MoC@NG@PDA) was coated on its outer surface to increase the antibody loading and MoS2-Au NPs were used as substrates to improve Ab(1) immobilization and accelerate electron transfer at the electrode interface, thereby improving the response signal of the immunosensor. Its concentration was linearly related to the response signal from 10 fg mL(-1) to 80 ng mL(-1), and the lowest limit of detection was 3 fg mL(-1). In addition, the immunosensor has acceptable selectivity and high stability. All data indicate that nanocomposites have electrocatalytic applications.

TI Carbon-coated CoSe2 nanoparticles confined in N-doped carbon
   microboxes with enhanced sodium storage properties
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Due to their high theoretical specific capacity, CoSe2-based anode materials have attracted enormous attention for sodium storage. However, the poor cycling stability and rate capability still hinder their application. Herein, starting from Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) Prussian blue analogue microcubes, a facile template-engaged strategy is developed to design and synthesize nanostructured dual-carbon-confined CoSe2 (denoted as DCC-CoSe2) microcubes. In this unique nanostructure, N-doped carbon-coated CoSe2 nanoparticles are confined in N-doped carbon microboxes. Benefiting from the desired structural features, the as-synthesized DCC-CoSe2 microcubes exhibit enhanced sodium storage properties in terms of high specific capacity (480 mA h g(-1)), excellent cycling stability (94.5% capacity retention over 2000 cycles), and superior rate capability (281 mA h g(-1) at 20 A g(-1)). The assembled full cell with DCC-CoSe2 microcubes as the anode material and Na3V2(PO4)(3) as the cathode material can deliver a high initial capacity of 427 mA h g(-1). This work provides a new strategy for the rational design and synthesis of high performance metal selenide-based anode materials for sodium storage.

TI Electrochemical ocean alkalinity enhancement using a calcium ion battery
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL
AB The oceans play a major role in moderating atmospheric CO2 levels. Enhanced CO2 uptake into ocean waters can be achieved by the provision of appropriate cations to the surface ocean, an approach known as ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE). Here, we present a calcium ion battery approach that enhances alkalinity via electro-chemical manipulation of seawater calcium concentrations. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using a potassium barium iron cyanide [K2BaFe(CN)(6)] (PBFC) electrode, a Prussian blue analogue, to move calcium ions from one reservoir of seawater to another. Using material and electrochemical characterization of the Ca2+ ion insertion and expulsion properties of PBFC in synthetic seawater, we determine the repeatability of Ca2+ ion insertion and expulsion from the PBFC electrode. Our analyses prove a 2.75 % increase in seawater alkalinity via the PBFC electrode, which yields 2.64 mg CO2 (0.72 mg C) uptake per liter of seawater. This proof-of-concept method offers a unique, low-cost, energy efficient electrochemical approach for atmospheric carbon dioxide removal that can combine with marine-based renewable energy to enable a new family of effective, scalable climate change solutions.

TI Coupling and decoupling of spin crossover and ferroelastic distortion:
   Unsymmetric hysteresis loop, phase diagram, and sequence of phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Spin-transition materials can exhibit thermal hysteresis due to cooperative elastic interactions in between active molecular sites. It results from the coupling of the nonsymmetry-breaking high spin fraction order parameter to the lattice volume strain. However, a symmetry-breaking order parameter responsible for crystallographic phase transition, like a ferroelastic distortion, can also couple to the volume strain. Here, we use the Landau theory to study the elastic coupling between a spin-crossover instability and a discontinuous ferroelastic distortion and the different phase transition lines. Below the triple point, the first-order line involves simultaneous ferroelastic distortion and spin transition. Above, the purely first-order ferroelastic distortion and the spin crossover occur sequentially. Our model, related to the coupling and decoupling of the ferroelastic phase transition and spin crossover, explains exotic behaviors reported experimentally in the literature for diverse spin-crossover systems, plastic crystals, or Prussian blue analogues. The unsymmetric hysteresis loops and the stepwise evolution of the spin conversion or volume strain under pressure result from different sequences of phase transitions. The model shows that the ferroelastic phase transition is the driving force of the cooperative spin transition hysteresis in this case.

   CoSe2@Nitrogen-Doped Carbon for Superior Sodium Ion Batteries
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Designing and synthesizing highly stable anode materials with high capacity is critical for the practical application of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), however, to date, this remains an insurmountable barrier. The introduction of hierarchical architectures and carbon supports is proving an effective strategy for addressing these challenges. Thus, we have fabricated a hierarchical CoSe2@nitrogen-doped carbon (CoSe2@NC) microcube composite using the Prussian blue analogue Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)as template. The rational combination of the unique hierarchical construction from one to three dimensions and a nitrogen-doped carbon skeleton facilitates sodium ion and electron transport as well as stabilizing the host structure during repeated discharge/charge processes, which contributes to its excellent sodium storage capability. As expected, the as-prepared CoSe2@NC composite delivered remarkable reversible capacity and ultralong cycling lifespan even at a high rate of 2.0 A g(-1)(384.3 mA h g(-1)after1800 loops) when serving as the anode material for SIBs. This work shows the great potential of the CoSe2-based anode for practical application in SIBs, and the original strategy may be extended to other anode materials.

TI Multifunctional Material: Bistable Metal-Cyanide Polymer of Rubidium
   Manganese Hexacyanoferrate
SO BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Since phase-transition phenomena in solid-state materials can change the magnetic, electrical, and optical properties with external stimuli, they are attracting widespread attention from the viewpoints of both fundamental science and practical applications. We have synthesized various cyano-bridged metal complexes possessing anomalous bistabilities that exhibit unprecedented phase transition phenomena. This paper focuses on rubidium manganese hexacyanoferrate, Rb,Mn[Fe(CN)(6)]((x+2)/3)center dot zH(2)O, which is a Prussian blue analogue. Here, the unique functionalities of rubidium manganese hexacyanoferrate are described: a charge-transfer-induced phase transition, control of the thermal hysteresis loop, and a huge thermal hysteresis with a hidden stable phase are presented as thermally-induced phase-transition phenomena, while a photoinduced phase collapse is described as a novel photoinduced phase-transition phenomenon. A one-shot-laser-induced charge-transfer phase transition is displayed as a photoinduced phase-transition phenomenon at ambient temperature. Moreover, second harmonic generation (SHG) and magnetization-induced second harmonic generation (MSHG) are provided as correlation effects between the optical and dielectrical properties. Finally, a one-shot-laser-induced photo-demagnetization and reversible photomagnetic switching between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism are demonstrated as photomagnetic effects.

TI Nitrogen-doped carbon confined NiFe-NiFeP nanocubes immobilized on
   carbon nanotube as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution
   reaction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The future sustainable energy related application, especially Zn-air batteries (ZABs) and electrochemical water splitting to produce hydrogen, are limited by oxygen evolution reac-tion (OER). Transition metal phosphides have excellent catalytic activity for OER, but their poor conductivity and bad stability still require to be solved. Herein, the nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) confined NiFe-NiFeP nanocubes immobilized on carbon nanotube (CNT) (NiFe-NiFeP@NC/CNT) is fabricated by employing NiFe-Prussian Blue Analogs (NiFe-PBAs) nanocubes and CNT composite as precursor, and subsequent polydopamine (PDA) coating, carbonization and partial phosphorization. Profiting from its unique "nanonecklaces" structure with conductive CNT and ordered NiFe-NiFeP@NC nanocubes, NiFe-NiFeP@NC/ CNT provides an efficient electron transfer path and uniformly dispersed active sites for OER process. The optimized NiFe-NiFeP@NC/CNT exhibits a low overpotential of 228 (328) mV at 10 (100) mA cm-2 and high durability. Furthermore, the NiFe-NiFeP@NC/CNT || Pt/C requires 1.51 V to realize 20 mA cm-2 for overall water spitting. And the ZAB assembled with NiFe-NiFeP@NC/CNT shows excellent discharge-charge stability for 240 h. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Bismuth nanoparticles embedded in a carbon skeleton as an anode for high
   power density potassium-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Bismuth is a promising anode for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to its suitable redox potential, large theoretical capacity, and superior electronic conductivity. Herein, we report a Bi@C (Bi nanoparticles uniformly embedded in a carbon skeleton) composite anode which delivers a superior rate performance of 244.3 mA h g(-1) at 10.0 A g(-1) and a reversible capacity of 255.6 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles in an optimized ether-based electrolyte. The outstanding electrochemical performance results from its robust structural design with fast reaction kinetics, which are confirmed by both experimental characterization studies and first-principles calculations. The reversible potassium storage mechanism of the Bi@C composite was also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction. In addition, the full PIB cell assembled with a Bi@C composite anode and nickel-based Prussian blue analogue cathode exhibits high discharge voltage (3.18 V), remarkable power density (>10 kW kg(-1)), and an excellent capacity retention of 87.8% after 100 cycles. The results demonstrate that the PIBs with Bi anodes are promising candidates for power-type energy storage devices.

TI Advancements in cathode materials for aqueous potassium-ion batteries
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Aqueous potassium ion batteries (APIBs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage systems due to their inherent safety, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. APIBs utilize water-based electrolytes, which significantly reduce the risk of flammability associated with organic solventbased electrolytes. Considering the potential applications of APIBs in grid-scale energy storage and portable electronics, it is of great significance for the study of APIBs. Among the components of APIBs, the cathode materials play a critical role and are the primary factors determining the energy density and power density of aqueous batteries. Therefore, to advance cathode materials, it is essential to summarize recent research progress. The review introduces various types of cathode materials, including Prussian blue and its analogs, metal oxides, MXenes, and polyanion-type compounds. It summarizes recent advances in cathode materials for APIBs, focusing on the advantages of these materials as well as the challenges they face and strategies for optimization. Finally, the review provides a summary and outlook on how to enhance the performance of cathode materials in APIBs. The purpose of this review is to provide some ideas for the development of new and efficient APIBs cathode.

TI Directly probing spin dynamics in a molecular magnet with femtosecond
   time-resolution
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB We show that a vanadium-chromium Prussian blue analogue, which is a room-temperature molecule-based magnet, displays a fast magnetic response on a femtosecond timescale that is attributed to the super-exchange interaction between the metal ions. These dynamics are obtained from femtosecond Faraday magneto-optical (MO) measurements, performed at 50 and 300 K. Exciting at the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) band results in the formation of the E-2 excited state on the Cr ion via intersystem crossing (ISC) from the (LMCT)-L-4 state in less than 250 fs. Subsequent vibrational relaxation in the 2E state occurs on a 0.78 +/- 0.05 ps timescale at 50 K and 1.1 +/- 0.1 ps at 300 K. The MO measurements can detect the formation of the E-2 state on the Cr ion from the change in the super-exchange interaction taking place as a result of the corresponding spin flip associated with the formation of the E-2 state. These results open up a new avenue to study molecular magnets using a powerful method that is capable of directly probing spin dynamics on a sub-picosecond timescale in thin film environments.

TI Iron-Locked Hydr(oxy)oxide Catalysts via Ion-Compensatory Reconstruction
   Boost Large-Current-Density Water Oxidation
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Nickel-iron based hydr(oxy)oxides have been well recognized as one of the best oxygen-evolving catalysts in alkaline water electrolysis. A crucial problem, however, is that iron leakage during prolonged operation would lead to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) deactivation over time, especially under large current densities. Here, the NiFe-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA) is designed as a structure-flexible precursor for navigating an electrochemical self-reconstruction (ECSR) with Fe cation compensation to fabricate a highly active hydr(oxy)oxide (NiFeOxHy) catalyst stabilized with Ni-Fe synergic active sites. The generated NiFeOxHy catalyst exhibits the low overpotentials of 302 and 313 mV required to afford large current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, its robust stability over 500 h at 500 mA cm(-2) stands out among the NiFe-based OER catalysts reported previously. Various in/ex situ studies indicate that the Fe fixation by dynamic reconstruction process can reinforce the Fe-activated effect on the OER amenable to the industrial-level large current conditions against the Fe leakage. This work opens up a feasible strategy to design highly active and durable catalysts via thermodynamically self-adaptive reconstruction engineering.

TI A Core-Shell Structured Na/Fe@Co Bimetallic Catalyst for
   Light-Hydrocarbon Synthesis from CO2 Hydrogenation
SO CATALYSTS
AB The direct CO2 Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (CO2-FTS) process has been proven as one of the indispensable and effective routes in CO2 utilization and transformation. Herein, we present a core-shell structured Na/Fe@Co bimetallic catalyst to boost CO2 conversion and light hydrocarbon (C-2 to C-4) selectivity, as well as inhibit the selectivity of CO. Compared to the Na/Fe catalyst, our Na/Fe@CoCo-3 catalyst enabled 50.3% CO2 conversion, 40.1% selectivity of light hydrocarbons (C-2-C-4) in all hydrocarbon products and a high olefin-to-paraffin ratio (O/P) of 7.5 at 330 & DEG;C and 3.0 MPa. Through the characterization analyses, the introduction of CoCo Prussian Blue Analog (CoCo PBA) not only increased the reducibility of iron oxide (Fe2O3 to Fe3O4), accelerated the formation of iron carbide (FexCy), but also adjusted the surface basic properties of catalysts. Moreover, the trace Co atoms acted as a second active center in the CO2-FTS process for heightening light hydrocarbon synthesis from CO hydrogenation. This work provides a novel core-shell structured bimetallistic catalyst system for light hydrocarbons, especially light olefin production from CO2 hydrogenation.

TI Efficient degradation of benzalkonium chloride by FeMn-CA300 catalyst
   activated persulfate process: Surface hydroxyl potentiation mechanism
   and degradation pathway
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB The consumption of disinfectants increased dramatically with the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. Benzalkonium chloride (DDBAC), a cationic surfactant disinfectant for import and export cargoes, is used for effective degradation method. For DDBAC effective degradation, polyhedral Fe-Mn bimetallic catalyst of Prussian blue analogue (FeMn-CA300) was novelty developed for rapid peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Results showed that the Fe/Mn redox and surface hydroxyl groups in the catalyst played an important role in the DDBACenhanced degradation. The removal effectiveness of 10 mg L-1 DDBAC was up to 99.4% in 80 min under the initial pH = 7, catalyst dosage of 0.4 g L-1, and PMS concentration of 15 mmol L-1. In addition, FeMn-CA300 had a wide pH applicability range. The results indicated that hydroxyls, sulfate radicals, and singlet oxygen could effectively improve the degradation efficiency, where sulfate radicals played a crucial role. Finally, the corresponding degradation path of DDBAC was further provided according to GC-MS results. The results of this study provide new insights into the degradation of DDBAC, thereby highlighting the great potential of FeMnca300/ PMS to control refractory organic compounds in the aqueous phase.

TI Pseudocapacitive storage in cathode materials of aqueous zinc ion
   batteries toward high power and energy density
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The pseudocapacitive storage process consists of faradaic redox reactions that occur nearby or upon the surface of materials, which is promising to enable high power and energy density for rechargeable batteries. In recent years, aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) have been expected to be applied in the energy storage field due to the advantages of inherent safety and low cost. Unfortunately, the sluggish reaction kinetics caused by the divalent charge of zinc ions makes it a hard challenge to assure the capacity of the cathode materials at high current densities. As an efficient charge storage mode in AZIB cathode materials, the role of the pseudocapacitive storage process in enhancing the capacity at a high current density cannot be ignored. Herein, a brief review on high-rate AZIB cathode materials with a significant pseudocapacitive storage process is presented from the perspective of manganese-based materials, vanadium-based derivatives and others including Prussian blue analogs, organic compounds, NASICONs and metal sulfide. Among them, we focus on how those representative designs induce significant pseudocapacitive behavior. Finally, a future outlook is provided aiming to promote the development of a pseudocapacitive high-rate cathode for AZIBs.

TI Establishing Exceptional Durability in Ultralow-Temperature
   Organic-Sodium Batteries via Stabilized Multiphase Conversions
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Operation of rechargeable batteries at ultralow temperature is a significant practical problem because of poor kinetics of the electrode. Here, we report for the first time stabilized multiphase conversions for fast kinetics and long-term durability in ultralow-temperature, organic-sodium batteries. We establish that disodium rhodizonate organic electrode in conjunction with single-layer graphene oxide obviates consumption of organic radical intermediates, and demonstrate as a result that the newly designed organic electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance of a highly significant capacity of 130 mAh g(-1 )at -50 C-degrees. We evidence that the full-cell configuration coupled with Prussian blue analogues exhibits exceptional cycling stability of >7000 cycles at -40 C-degrees while maintaining a discharge capacity of 101 mAh g(-1 )at a high current density 300 mA g(-1). We show this is among the best reported ultralow-temperature performance for nonaqueous batteries, and importantly, the pouch cell exhibits a continuous power supply despite conditions of -50 C-degrees. This work sheds light on the distinct energy storage characteristics of organic electrode and opens up new avenues for the development of reliable and sustainable ultralow-temperature batteries.

TI Realizing a Rechargeable High-Performance Cu-Zn Battery by Adjusting the
   Solubility of Cu<SUP>2+</SUP>
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Rechargeable aqueous Zn-based batteries show great potential for energy storage systems due to their good reliability, low cost, environmental friendliness, etc. However, the capacity of the most studied Mn-, V-, and Prussian blue analog-based Zn-ion batteries (the type with Zn2+ insertion) and the other type Zn-based batteries without Zn2+ insertion (such as metal Ag and Ni or Co oxides/hydroxides) does not exceed 400 mAh g(-1). Cu is a promising cathode with a high theoretical capacity of 844 mAh g(-1) based on its unique two-electron transfer process (Cu-0 <-> Cu2+), but Cu-Zn batteries have been impractical to recharge since they was invented by Daniell in 1836. By adjusting the solubility of Cu2+ in an alkaline solution, a rechargeable high-performance Cu-Zn battery is achieved. A high specific capacity of 718 mAh g(-1) is obtained for the prepared Cu clusters. Moreover, commercial Cu foil is explored for direct use as the cathode material and shows high capacity and stability through a simple self-activation process. This rechargeable Cu-Zn battery is attractive for application due to its high capacity, simple synthesis method, environmental friendliness, and low cost.

TI Magnetic boron nitride adorned with Pd nanoparticles: an efficient
   catalyst for the reduction of nitroarenes in aqueous media
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an excellent support material for nanocatalysts due to its two-dimensional (2D) architectural morphology and physicochemical stability. In this study, a chemically stable, recoverable, eco-friendly, and magnetic h-BN/Pd/Fe2O3 catalyst was prepared by a one-step calcination process, in which Pd and Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) were uniformly decorated on the surface of h-BN via a typical adsorption-reduction procedure. In detail, nanosized magnetic (Pd/Fe2O3) NPs were derived from a Prussian blue analogue prototype, a well-known porous metal-organic framework, and then further surface-engineered to produce magnetic BN nanoplate-supported Pd nanocatalysts. The structural and morphological features of h-BN/Pd/Fe2O3 were investigated by spectroscopic and microscopic characterization techniques. Moreover, the h-BN nanosheets endow it with stability and appropriate chemical anchoring sites which solve the problems of inefficient reaction rate and high consumption caused by the inevitable agglomeration of precious metal NPs. Under mild reaction conditions, the developed nanostructured h-BN/Pd/Fe2O3 as the catalyst shows high yield and efficient reusability in reducing nitroarenes into the corresponding anilines using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reductant.

TI MnFeOx@TiO2 Nanocages for Selective
   Catalytic Reduction of NO with NH3 at Low Temperature
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Based on Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), using the in situ self-assembly method, MnFeOx@TiO2 double-walled nanocages with a hollow and porous structure were constructed by annealing the core-shell structure of Mn-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O@Ti(OH)(4). Compared with the MnFeOx single-walled nanocages without the TiO2 shell, the MnFeOx@TiO2 double-walled nanocages exhibited a better catalytic performance in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with NH3 at low temperatures, and the NO removal efficiency could reach 80% at 145-260 degrees C. Establishing the TiO2 shell layer could effectively improve the adsorption and activation performance of the reactants. Through a series of characterizations, it was confirmed that the MnFeOx@TiO2 double-walled nanocages possessed a large specific surface area, abundant structural defects, and oxygen vacancies. Besides, the MnFeOx@TiO2 catalyst had more Mn4+ species, higher Fe3+ species, more surface-adsorbed oxygen (O-a(ds)) species, and a strong interaction between MnOx, FeOx, and the TiO2 shell, which led to better catalytic activity. At the same time, the MnFeOx@TiO2 double-walled nanocages exhibited satisfactory thermal stability and better H2O resistance.

TI Reversible Multivalent (Monovalent, Divalent, Trivalent) Ion Insertion
   in Open Framework Materials
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The reversible electrochemical insertion of multivalent ions into materials has promising applications in many fields, including batteries, seawater desalination, element purification, and wastewater treatment. However, finding materials that allow for the insertion of multivalent ions with fast kinetics and stable cycling has proven difficult because of strong electrostatic interactions between the highly charged insertion ions and atoms in the host framework. Here, an open framework nanomaterial, copper hexacyanoferrate, in the Prussian Blue family is presented that allows for the reversible insertion of a wide variety of monovalent, divalent, and trivalent ions (such as Rb+, Pb2+, Al3+, and Y3+) in aqueous solution beyond that achieved in previous studies. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate the unprecedented kinetics of multivalent ion insertion associated with this material. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments point toward a novel vacancy-mediated ion insertion mechanism that reduces electrostatic repulsion and helps to facilitate the observed rapid ion insertion. The results suggest a new approach to multi valent ion insertion that may help to advance the understanding of this complex phenomenon.

TI Co-Fe-MoSx hollow nanoboxes as high-performance
   counter electrode catalysts for Pt-free dye-sensitized solar cells
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Box-structured nanomaterials with complicated surface texture, whose morphologies can be adjusted through changing mass ratios of reactants, are attractive in the field of electrochemical energy conversion. Herein, we report the shape-controllable synthesis of MoS2 doped cobalt iron sulfide (Co-Fe-MoSx) hollow nanoboxes with three different mass ratios of cobalt iron Prussian-blue-analog (Co-Fe PBA) nanocubes to (NH4)(2)MoS4 and their applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As the increment of MoS42- in system, the surface of Co-Fe-MoSx became rough with bushy embedded nanosheets. Benefiting from the three-dimensional nanostructure with more exposed edge sites and appropriate doped ratio, the Co-Fe-MoSx-2 hollow nanoboxes performed rough shells, well-defined interior voids, large specific surface areas and outstanding catalytic actives. By contrast, the sulfide of Co-Fe PBA (Co-Fe-S) and bare MoS2 showed bad morphology and poor catalytic performance. It is notable that the DSSC with Co-Fe-MoSx-2 showed a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.63% than that of Pt based cell (8.23%) under AM 1.5G irradiation.

TI Enzyme-like biomimetic oral-agent enabling modulating gut microbiota and
   restoring redox homeostasis to treat inflammatory bowel disease
SO BIOACTIVE MATERIALS
AB Reactive oxygen species (ROS), immune dysregulation-induced inflammatory outbreaks and microbial imbalance play critical roles in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Herein, a novel enzyme-like biomimetic oral-agent ZnPBA@YCW has been developed, using yeast cell wall (YCW) as the outer shell and zincdoped Prussian blue analogue (ZnPBA) nanozyme inside. When orally administered, the ZnPBA@YCW is able to adhere to Escherichia coli occupying the ecological niche in IBD and subsequently release the ZnPBA nanozyme for removal of E. coli, meanwhile exhibiting improved intestinal epithelial barrier repair. Moreover, it is found that the ZnPBA nanozyme exhibits remarkable capability in restoring redox homeostasis by scavenging ROS and inhibiting NF-kappa B signaling pathway. More importantly, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing results indicate that post-oral of ZnPBA@YCW can effectively regulate gut microbiota by enhancing the bacterial richness and diversity, significantly increasing the abundance of probiotics with anti-inflammatory phenotype while downgrading pathogenic E. coli to the same level as normal mice. Such a novel nanomedicine provides a new idea for efficient treating those ROS-mediated diseases accompanying with flora disorders.

TI Modulating surface properties of Mn-Fe nanocube-like catalyst to
   activate peroxymonosulfate for effective benzalkonium chloride
   degradation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The increasing consumption of Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) require more available and efficient processing techniques for environmental protection. Here in, etched MnFe nanocubes (E-MnFe NC) with cubic-like struc-tures were synthesized as peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator for BAC degradation via etching and calcination treatment of MnFe Prussian blue analogues (MnFe PBA). In this E-MnFe NC/PMS system, more than 99% BAC was degraded with the mineralization efficiency of 59.8% under optimum condition in 60 min. For mechanism, quenching results and EPR analysis demonstrated that both SO4 center dot  and HO center dot are main contributor in the oxidation process. The transformation of surface charge and hydrophobic properties boosted the BAC adsorption, thus contributing to subsequent oxidation reaction. Meanwhile, the enhancement of electron transfer efficiency dominated by oxygen vacancies promoted the catalytic performance. Finally, the degradation pathway of BAC was proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) analysis and GC-MS results. Meanwhile, E-MnFe NC/ PMS system possessed ascendant stability and reusability, as well as certain feasibility in actual environmental application. Overall, this work provides valuable references for quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) degradation via SR-AOP about Fe-Mn catalyst.

TI N-doped graphene encapsulated FeNi core-shell with S defects for the
   oxygen evolution reaction
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The synergistic effect between the transition metal sulfide alloy core, the N-doped graphene shell, and the internal interfacial potential serves to regulate the electronic structure and facilitate electron transfer. We used Fe-based Prussian blue analogues as a single precursor to prepare a N-doped graphene-coated metal core-shell structure (FeNi@NG) through hydrothermal and high-temperature solid phase reactions. The S source was then introduced and annealed, yielding a S, N co-doped graphene-encapsulated metal core-shell structure (FeNi-S@NG). Finally, a nitrogen-doped graphene-coated metal core-shell structure with S defects (S-FeNi@NG) was obtained through NaBH4 liquid-phase reduction. The synergistic effect between the transition metal sulfide alloy core and the N-doped graphene shell, in conjunction with the internal interfacial potential regulate the electronic structure and facilitate electron transfer. Numerous sulfur vacancies accelerate electron transfer and enhance OER catalytic performance. The optimized material, S-FeNi@NG, exhibited excellent OER catalytic performance, with an overpotential of 250 mV (at 10 mA cm-2) and a Tafel slope of 90.95 mV dec-1 in an alkaline electrolyte.

TI 2D/3D hierarchical and multi-heterostructured Co/Ni/Fe phosphosulfide as
   a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water
   splitting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Morphological design and interfacial engineering are pivotal strategies for advancing electrocatalysis, however, achieving the optimization of both simultaneously remains a major challenge. To address this, we designed a multi-heterostructured bifunctional electrocatalyst cobalt-nickel-iron-phosphorus-sulfur composite (CoNiFe-PS) with a two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) hierarchical structure, which was synthesized through simultaneous phosphating and sulfuration based on cobalt-nickel layered double hydroxide (CoNi-LDH) nano-sheets grafted with Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes. Notably, due to the distinctive morphology and synergistic effect between multi-heterostructure, the CoNiFe-PS catalyst demonstrated excellent performance in terms of ultralow overpotentials of 196 and 263 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as 63 and 235 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2. Moreover, the CoNiFe-PS|| CoNiFe-PS cell was constructed for overall water splitting in alkaline condition and exhibited minimal voltage requirements of 1.479 and 1.693 V to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. This study provides a new perspective on fabricating multi-heterostructured bifunctional catalysts with unique morphology for highly efficient overall water splitting.

TI Nanoparticle foam flotation for caesium decontamination using a
   pH-sensitive surfactant
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO
AB Ion extraction processes show some limitations related to their selectivity, efficiency, cost and ecological footprint. The recent Fukushima event has stimulated the hunt for innovative extraction processes of the caesium ion. Here, we propose a caesium foam flotation process of a highly selective complexing agent, namely the copper based Prussian blue analogue (Cu-PBA), using a pH-sensitive foaming agent (collector): a polyethoxylated amine surfactant (Ethomeen (R)). The foaming properties, surface charge and surface activity of this complex chemical system have been investigated as a function of pH. It was demonstrated that the pH controls the flotation efficiency through electrostatic interactions between the surfactant and the Cu-PBA. The flotation was highly efficient for pH < 5, where all of the Cu-PBA was extracted by the foam. In contrast, for pH > 10, all of the Cu-BPA remained in the foaming solution and was not extracted in the foam. As a consequence, reversible extraction/de-extraction of the Cu-PBA was made possible through pH cycles, which enables the recycling of the surfactant, reducing both the cost and the environmental impact of the overall process.

TI Diverse physical functionalities of rare-earth hexacyanidometallate
   frameworks and their molecular analogues
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Rare-earth (RE) metal complexes exhibit attractive magnetic and optical properties related to their strong magnetic anisotropy and efficient photoluminescence. Due to the accessibility of high coordination numbers, they are useful molecular building blocks for the construction of bimetallic coordination systems. Therefore, they can be readily combined with hexacyanidometallate ions of transition metals into the d-f cyanido-bridged frameworks. This leads to the rich family of molecule-based materials varying from purely inorganic 3-D REIII-[M-II/III(CN)(6)](4-/3-) (RE = La-Lu, Y; M = Cr, Fe, Ru, Co) networks, through coordination polymers of lower dimensionality obtained with supporting organic ligands, up to strictly molecular species. The past decade brought intensive interest in the design and synthesis of rare-earth hexacyanidometallate frameworks with particular attention paid to their magnetic, optical, electronic, and mechanical properties. In this review, we discuss the most important results of this research area, including remarkable thermal expansion properties, magnetic ordering effects, single-molecule magnetism, luminescent functionalities, electrochemical activity for applications in alkali ion batteries and electroanalytical sensing, and efficient NMR relaxivity for magnetic resonance imaging, as well as photo- and pressure-induced switching of magnetic and optical characteristics. We focus on the recent advances, emphasizing also the general advantages and the future perspectives in the combination of RE(III) complexes and hexacyanidometallates within the d-f coordination frameworks towards the generation of diverse physical functionalities.

TI Enhancement of Stability by Positive Disruptive Effect on Mn-Fe Charge
   Transfer in Vacancy-Free Mn-Co Hexacyanoferrate Through a
   Charge/Discharge Process in Aqueous Na-Ion Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Several materials have been studied as electrodes for aqueous batteries that use sodium as alkali ion; these include Prussian blue analogue or hexacyanoferrates. The inhibition or disruption on metal-metal charge transfer plays an important role for improving electrochemical stability of the material. The stability improvement is achieved when two external metals are coordinated to N ends in the Na-rich hexacyanoferrates. Additionally, the presence of vacancies in the material is another important factor that influences its stability. In this study, NaxCo1-yMny[Fe(CN)(6)] has been synthesized at different Mn/Co ratios by precipitation using citrate as a chelating agent to obtain a material without vacancies. Its electrochemical behavior during redox processes and the correlation with the electronic interaction between external metal sites in the framework through the interaction of spins have been studied too. To discuss the effect of the presence of [Fe(CN)(6)](n-) vacancies on the electrochemical process, we synthesized a material without citrate for obtaining materials with low ferrocyanide vacancies. The vacancy-free Co0.55Mn0.45HF versus n-CoMnHF, were compared in this work. These studies reveal that manganese hexacyanoferrate is unstable. The partial substitution of Co by Mn modifies the metals spin ordering and consequently, the interaction between metals coordinated to N in the cyanide linker. Such partial substitution, with a Mn/Co ratio of 1:1 (Co0.55Mn0.45HF), improves the electrochemical stability and enhances the discharged potential as well. On the other hand, when vacancies are present, the n-CoMnHF compound showed a decrease in its crystallinity as well as in its external metal interaction. Both changes may be due to the presence of coordinated water, which modifies electrochemical performance. A spontaneous hopping from Mn to Fe during oxidation in n-CoMnHF was detected, but this phenomenon was disrupted in Co0.55Mn0.45HF. Such charge transfer inhibition was associated with the modification of electron delocalization on Fe (LS); which was caused by the external metals; mainly by Co.

TI Long-life Na-rich nickel hexacyanoferrate capable of working under
   stringent conditions
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue materials have been considered as ideal cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their unique open framework structure. Among those, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) with "zero strain" characteristics is of peculiar interest. In this work, large-size, multi-edge structured Na-rich NiHCF was prepared via a controlled coprecipitation method. At 25 degrees C, the NiHCF exhibits extremely stable cycling with 90.4% capacity retained after 16 000 cycles at 20C (1C = 85 mA g(-1)). Besides, the material shows superior rate capability with 78.5% capacity yielded at 50C relativ to 0.2C. The material also exhibits stable cycling under stringent conditions, namely, at high/low temperatures and after overcharge/overdischarge abuse. High capacity retentions, 95.5% over 600 cycles at 60 degrees C and 91.9% over 1800 cycles at -20 degrees C, are achieved for this material after being cycled at 5C. After overcharge to 4.8 V and overdischarge to 1.2 V, the NiHCF can still exhibit good cycling stability with both the structure and capacity recovered in the normal voltage window. The NiHCF also demonstrates a long cycle life in an aqueous NiHCF/Zn battery, maintaining 84.1% capacity after 3100 cycles at 5C. A scale-up preparation of kilogram-grade NiHCF was realized and pouch-type NiHCF/hard carbon full batteries were fabricated and evaluated to realize potential applications of the material.

TI The emerging high-entropy cathode materials for advanced Na-ion
   batteries: advances and perspectives
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Na-ion batteries (NIBs) show great potential for renewable clean energy and low-speed electric vehicles. The cathode material, being one of the main components determining the NIB performance, still requires further development. The compelling features of the high-entropy (HE) configuration expand the cathode design space and break the design shackles of conventional binary or ternary cathodes. The recent development of HE cathodes with significant structural stability and appropriate redox kinetics shows considerable promise for addressing the issues limiting the implementation of NIBs. This review summarizes the primary factors affecting the development of HE cathodes for low-cost NIBs. We first discuss the fundamentals, including the definitions, "core effects," composition-property relationships, and the design principles of HE cathodes. Also, we summarize the recent advances in layered, polyanion-type, and Prussian blue cathodes with HE configurations used for NIBs, including the electrochemical performance characteristics and the clarification of the acting mechanism of the HE cathodes. Lastly, we discuss the remaining main challenges hindering the development and practical applications of HE cathodes in NIBs. This review intends to provide a guiding principle with some profound implications for the rational design and development of HE materials for NIBs and other metal-ion batteries.

TI Fundamentals and key components of sodium-ion batteries: Challenges and
   future perspectives
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Energy storage systems play a pivotal role in modern society by addressing the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and enhancing grid stability. Among these systems, rechargeable batteries stand out as a key technology to provide efficient and portable energy storage solutions. As a buffer to balance variations in supply and demand, rechargeable batteries store electrical energy during times of surplus generation or low demand and release it when needed. These batteries are made up of electrochemical cells, which store and release electrical energy through reversible processes. A common type of rechargeable battery is lithium-ion battery (LIB) which is widely utilized in portable electronics and electric vehicles. But the expense and scarcity of lithium supplies forced scientists to investigate other materials, which brought them to study sodium-ion chemistry, reflecting a pursuit for development of alternative sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The advent of SIBs represents a paradigm change in the field of energy storage, showcasing creativity and flexibility in response to the changing needs of a more sustainable and easily obtainable energy supply. Here, electrodes act as crucial element in SIBs and therefore, electrodes must be developed with high compatibility and stability to ensure good performance in SIBs. Recently, transition metal oxides, Prussian blue analogues, polyanionic compounds and organic materials have been investigated as cathode materials for SIBs. In unison, latest progressions have been done to fabricate many anode materials such as carbon-based materials, alloy-based compounds, MXenes, metal oxides and sulfides and organic compounds. Concurrently, many modifications have been made to enhance the performance and stability of electrode materials in the battery systems. Apart from that, many electrolytes have been widely investigated for SIBs to enhance the performance, efficiency and safety features. To give insights into the structures and morphologies of the electrode materials as well as the electrochemical performance of the systems, various advanced characterization techniques have also been reviewed. In this article, we have outlined and exchanged views on the research materials that have been explored and proposed future perspectives for SIBs. This review offers crucial insights into practical and scientific problems related to the evolution of SIBs.

TI Effect of surface acidity of cyano-bridged polynuclear metal complexes
   on the catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of organophosphates
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Heterogeneous catalysis of cyano-bridged polynuclear metal complexes, which were prepared by systematic replacement of C-bound metal ions (M-C) and/or N-bound metal ions (M-N) of Prussian blue ([M-N(H2O)(x)](y)[Fe-II/III(CN)(6)]; M-N = Fe-III, Ga-III, Mn-II, Zn-II or Co-II: [Fe-II/III(H2O)(x)](y)[M-C(CN)(6)]; M-C = Fe-II, Pt-IV, Co-III, Ir-III or Ru-II), was examined for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol phosphate (p-NPP) as a model compound of insecticides. The catalytic activity of the complexes was enhanced by employing metal ions in higher oxidation states at the C- and N-bound sites, although only N-bound metal ions act as active sites. The dependence of the initial reaction rates for the hydrolysis on the initial concentration of p-NPP suggested that the rate determining step is the adsorption of p-NPP onto catalyst surfaces. The surface acidity of each complex estimated by the heat of pyridine desorption is strongly correlated with catalytic activity.

TI Screen-Printable Functional Nanomaterials for Flexible and Wearable
   Single-Enzyme-Based Energy-Harvesting and Self-Powered Biosensing
   Devices
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB Developing flexible bioelectronics is essential to the realization of artificial intelligence devices and biomedical applications, such as wearables, but their potential is limited by sustainable energy supply. An enzymatic biofuel cell (BFC) is promising for power supply, but its use is limited by the challenges of incorporating multiple enzymes and rigid platforms. This paper shows the first example of screen-printable nanocomposite inks engineered for a single-enzyme-based energy-harvesting device and a self-powered biosensor driven by glucose on bioanode and biocathode. The anode ink is modified with naphthoquinone and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), whereas the cathode ink is modified with Prussian blue/MWCNT hybrid before immobilizing with glucose oxidase. The flexible bioanode and the biocathode consume glucose. This BFC yields an open circuit voltage of 0.45 V and a maximum power density of 266 mu W cm(-2). The wearable device coupled with a wireless portable system can convert chemical energy into electric energy and detect glucose in artificial sweat. The self-powered sensor can detect glucose concentrations up to 10 mM. Common interfering substances, including lactate, uric acid, ascorbic acid, and creatinine, have no effect on this self-powered biosensor. Additionally, the device can endure multiple mechanical deformations. New advances in ink development and flexible platforms enable a wide range of applications, including on-body electronics, self-sustainable applications, and smart fabrics.

TI FeCo alloy encased in nitrogen-doped carbon for efficient formaldehyde
   removal: Preparation, electronic structure, and d-band center tailoring
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Formaldehyde is a typical indoor air pollutant that has posed severely adverse effects on human health. Herein, a novel FeCo alloy nanoparticle-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (FeCo@NC) was synthesized with the aim of tailoring the transition-metal d-band structure toward an improved formaldehyde oxidation activity for the first time. A unique core@shell metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) architecture with a Fe-based Prussian blue analogue core and Co-containing zeolite imidazole framework shell was firstly fabricated. Then, Fe and Co ion alloying was readily achieved owing to the inherent MOF porosity and interionic nonequilibrium diffusion occurring during pyrolysis. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectra confirm that small FeCo alloys in situ form in FeCo@NC, which exhibits a higher formaldehyde removal efficiency (93%) than the monometallic Fe-based catalyst and a remarkable CO2 selectivity (85%) at room temperature. Density functional theory calculations indicate the number of electrons transferred from the metal core to the outer carbon layer is altered by alloying Fe and Co. More importantly, a downshift in the d-band center relative to the Fermi level occurs from - 0.93 to - 1.04 eV after introducing Co, which could alleviate the adsorption of reaction intermediates and greatly improve the catalytic performance.

TI A unique space confined strategy to construct defective metal oxides
   within porous nanofibers for electrocatalysis
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Integrating defective nanoparticles (NPs) into a porous one-dimensional (1D) architecture is highly desirable for electrocatalysis due to the enhanced exposure of defective sites and accelerated mass transport features, yet it is a great challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of defective metal oxide NPs interconnected with porous nanofibers via a unique space confined strategy. Central to this strategy is encapsulating Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cubes into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers. Due to the distinct pyrolysis behaviors of PBAs and PAN (i.e., expansion outwards, and contraction inwards, respectively), PAN confers a space confined effect on the PBA-derived metal oxides during calcination in air, resulting in the formation of various lattice defects and unsaturated metal sites on the metal oxides. Consequently, with unsaturated metal sites and an advantageous architecture (i.e., 1D porous nanofibers), the resulting nanofibers with P dopants display good performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Notably, as bifunctional electrocatalysts, the nanofibers deliver an overall water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small voltage of 1.52 V. This work paves new pathways toward utilizing distinct pyrolysis behaviours of metal-organic compounds and polymers to construct defective nanomaterials with advanced architectures.

TI Electrodeposited Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6] Thin-Film Cathodes
   Exposed to Simulated Aqueous Na-Ion Battery Conditions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Na-ion batteries have recently attracted great attention regarding their application in large-scale energy storage systems. Among different types of electrode materials for those classes of batteries, so-called Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are among the very attractive ones due to their comparatively simple and low-cost methods of synthesis coupled with a promising cycle performance. In this study, one of the state-of-the-art PBA battery materials, namely electrodeposited Na2Ni[Fe(CN)(6)] (NiHCF) thin films, were tested under simulated battery conditions in aqueous and mixed (H2O/organic) electrolytes. Prolonged stability tests in aqueous electrolytes were performed together with in-operando electrochemical AFM monitoring. It is demonstrated that degradation of this material is not associated with noticeable morphological changes (mechanical stress) but is likely caused by changes in the chemical composition of the films. Intercalation and deintercalation reversibility of Na+ and thin film stability in aqueous electrolytes appear to be unaffected negatively by changes in the pH to values below 7. However, the films showed unstable behavior in basic media (pH > 10). The increase of the content of acetonitrile, which was used as an additive to simulate the influence of antifreezes in aqueous electrolytes, appears to primarily affect the deintercalation of Na ions in Na2SO4-based aqueous electrolytes.

TI Heterointerface construction of carbon coated cobalt-iron phosphide
   space-confined in hollow porous carbon balls to promote
   internal/external sodium storage kinetics
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Metal phosphides exhibit enormous potential in energy storage systems owing to their diversified species, suit-able redox potential, and high theoretical capacities. Herein, heterostructured CoP/FeP coated with carbon layer and confined in hollow porous carbon balls (HPCBs) to construct a ball in ball architecture with interior voids is synthesized through a room temperature wet-chemistry method and a phosphatization route with Prussian blue analogues as the precursor. The composite exhibits enhanced energy storage properties when uti-lized for sodium-ion batteries. The excellent property of the composite can be ascribed to the delicately design of the metal phosphide heterostructure and the coating and confinement effect of carbonaceous materials syn-chronously. Experimental and theoretical calculation results demonstrate the heterostructure is constructed to acquire charge redistribution and lattice distortion to boost internal reaction kinetics. And the combination of the dual carbonaceous materials, possessing the ability of prevent the aggregation of active substances, the exceptional mechanics buffer capability of interior voids provided by HPCBs, and the excellent electrical char-acteristics of carbon layers and HPCBs to promote external energy storage kinetics and intergranular charge transfer. The research provides an effective strategy for the melioration of internal/external reaction kinetics to deliver ions durably and efficiently in energy storage regions.

TI Hollow ZnCdS and NiCoP Nanostructures for Photocatalytic Hydrogen
   Generation
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB To promote photocatalytic reactions and sustain structural stabilities, nanostructured photocatalysts, particularly in hollow and/or framelike forms, have attracted great attention. The photocatalysts with hollow or framelike structures possess advantageous features for photocatalytic reactions with an enlarged accessible surface area, promoted light-response capability, and shortened charge-transfer distance. Here, two fresh hollow-structured nanomaterials, cubiclike ZnCdS (H-ZCS) and NiCoP (H-NCP) frameworks, were designed and synthesized for the first time based on Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with an open framework structure, tunable compositions, and uniform metal active sites. They were coupled as advanced functional H-NCP/H-ZCS architectures with double-hollow nanostructures and close contact interfaces for an improved visible-light-driven H-2 evolution. Interestingly, the two hollow-structured frameworks have the same start in preparation, that is, H-NCP and H-ZCS are two homologous hollow nanomaterials, which is undoubtedly beneficial for the design and construction of more advanced functional architectures based on the PBA-induction strategy. In addition, the newly developed cubiclike H-ZCS frameworks exhibit an enlarged surface area and narrower band gap in comparison with the reported ZCS nanoparticles. The resultant double-hollow H-NCP/H-ZCS architectures exhibit an enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate, being up to about 73 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1).

TI Interfacially-engineered PBA based hierarchical structure with
   Ni(OH)2 nanocatalyst towards fire retardation of epoxy resin
SO POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY
AB The extended usage of epoxy resin (EP) has suffered from the notorious issue of high fire hazard, including the release of considerable heat and emission of abundant toxicants (smoke and toxic gasses). Hence, a prussian blue analogue (PBA) based hierarchical structure (Co@Ni(OH)(2)-A) with Ni(OH)(2) nanocatalyst, is proposed via interfacial-engineering strategy, towards reducing the fire hazard of EP. As revealed, Co@Ni(OH)(2)-A shows strong interfacial catalytic strengths both in charring of decomposed volatiles and oxidizing of toxic gasses. By using 4.0 wt% Co@Ni(OH)(2)-A, the peak heat release rate, peak smoke production rate, total smoke production and peak CO production rate are reduced by 45.5%, 55.0%, 44.3% and 65.3%, respectively. Fire resistance comparison with previous works confirms the advantage of Co@Ni(OH)(2)-A in toxicants elimination. Owing to the well-generated hierarchical structure-polymer interfaces, the greatly enhanced mechanical property is obtained. Generally speaking, Co@Ni(OH)(2)-A holds exceptional efficacy in promoting the polymer fire safety and mechanical performance. This investigation may offer useful enlightenments for acquiring high-performance EP composites via designing PBA based flame retardants with hierarchically tailored structure.

TI Ultralow Ru Loading Transition Metal Phosphides as High-Efficient
   Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for a Solar-to-Hydrogen Generation System
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Water splitting is a promising technology for sustainable conversion of hydrogen energy. The rational design of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) bifunctional electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability in the same electrolyte is the key to promoting their large-scale applications. Herein, an ultralow Ru (1.08 wt%) transition metal phosphide on nickel foam (Ru-MnFeP/NF) derived from Prussian blue analogue, that effectively drivies both the OER and the HER in 1 m KOH, is reported. To reach 20 mA cm(-2) for OER and 10 mA cm(-2) for HER, the Ru-MnFeP/NF electrode only requires overpotentials of 191 and 35 mV, respectively. Such high electrocatalytic activity exceeds most transition metal phosphides for the OER and the HER, and even reaches Pt-like HER electrocatalytic levels. Accordingly, it significantly accelerates full water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) with 1.470 V, which outperforms that of the integrated RuO2 and Pt/C couple electrode (1.560 V). In addition, the extremely long operational stability (50 h) and the successful demonstration of a solar-to-hydrogen generation system through full water splitting provide more flexibility for large-scale applications of Ru-MnFeP/NF catalysts.

TI A Multi-Color Four-Mode Electrochromic Window for All-Season Thermal
   Regulation in Buildings
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Electrochromic windows can control the amount of sunlight entering buildings, thus enabling thermal regulation and offering a significant opportunity to reduce building energy consumption. However, current electrochromic windows encounter difficulties with multi-color control and fully independent adjustment of visible light and near-infrared heat. Herein, this work introduces an advanced multi-color four-mode dual-band electrochromic smart window (DESW) that not only showcases various color transformations but also independently manages visible light and near-infrared heat from solar radiation, providing year-round thermal regulation for buildings. This device features a zinc anode with Prussian blue analogues and tungsten oxide film electrodes. Its optical state superposition effect allows for a range of color transformations (yellow, orange, green, and black), enhancing visual appeal and offering four distinct optical states for precise control of visible light and near-infrared transmittance. Simulation results show that this device achieves greater energy efficiency than commercial glass in most global climates throughout the year. Moreover, the energy generated by this multi-color four-mode DESW can be used to power low-energy devices within the building, further decreasing overall energy consumption. This research opens up extensive possibilities for smart window design and supports the development of green buildings, contributing to global carbon neutrality and sustainable development.

TI Elucidating the role of double-confined effect in hollow MOFs/GO
   catalytic membrane for deep arsenic pollution treatment
SO DESALINATION
AB The significance of addressing arsenic contamination is huge, given its widespread environmental impact and detrimental effects on human health. Herein, we developed a double-confined catalytic membrane capable of activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by integrating hollow Prussian blue analogues (H-PBA) with a unique voidconfinement effect into graphene oxide (GO) laminates. This delicately designed H-PBA/GO membrane displayed 98.8 % p-arsanilic acid (p-ASA) removal with a 9.03 s retention time, surpassing most reported studies. Our experiments underscored that the dual-confined architecture not only drove mass transfer but also bolstered reactant concentration, thereby multiplying catalytic activities. Remarkably, this double-confinement conduced to a sustained dominance of surface-radicals (SO4 center dot- ) and singlet oxygen (1O2), bolstering p-ASA degradation across a broad pH spectrum and numerous aqueous realms, inclusive of high salinity waters pertinent to desalination pre-treatment processes. Crucially, the H-PBA/GO membrane demonstrated over 90 % degradation of pASA and immobilized total As, unfaltering over 80 h of continuous operation. This signified an evolution in membrane technology, promising enhanced and steadfast performance. This innovation bore profound implications for devising double-confined efficacious and robust catalysts, poised to revolutionize advanced wastewater treatment, notably augmenting desalination systems by fortifying pre-treatment and safeguarding reverse osmosis membranes from organic and arsenic fouling.

TI A Self-Reconstructed Bifunctional Electrocatalyst of Pseudo-Amorphous
   Nickel Carbide @ Iron Oxide Network for Seawater Splitting
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Here, a sol-gel method is used to prepare a Prussian blue analogue (NiFe-PBA) precursor with a 2D network, which is further annealed to an Fe3O4/NiCx composite (NiFe-PBA-gel-cal), inheriting the ultrahigh specific surface area of the parent structure. When the composite is used as both anode and cathode catalyst for overall water splitting, it requires low voltages of 1.57 and 1.66 V to provide a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline freshwater and simulated seawater, respectively, exhibiting no obvious attenuation over a 50 h test. Operando Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that NiOOH2-x active species containing high-valence Ni3+/Ni4+ are in situ generated from NiCx during the water oxidation. Density functional theory calculations combined with ligand field theory reveal that the role of high valence states of Ni is to trigger the production of localized O 2p electron holes, acting as electrophilic centers for the activation of redox reactions for oxygen evolution reaction. After hydrogen evolution reaction, a series of ex situ and in situ investigations indicate the reduction from Fe3+ to Fe2+ and the evolution of Ni(OH)(2) are the origin of the high activity.

TI Vanadium hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles connected by cross-linked carbon
   nanotubes conductive networks for aqueous zinc-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted increasing attention in the field of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) with the advantages of an open framework with adjustable valence and easy synthesis. However, due to the disadvantages of unstable structure and insufficient active sites, PBAs as cathode materials for AZIBs still have problems such as low specific capacity or poor cycle performance. In this work, a simple in-situ co -precipitation method is used to grow vanadium hexacyanoferrate (VHCF) nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which aims to improve the conductivity of electrode materials by introducing a conductive skeleton of CNTs. This hybrid structure of VHCF nanoparticles and CNTs promotes electron transport between VHCF nanoparticles, thereby effectively improving the utilization of the material. Benefiting from the inherent sufficient channels for ions insertion/extraction of VHCF and the excellent conductivity of CNTs, the VHCF/CNTs hybrid as AZIBs cathode material shows excellent zinc storage performance with a high reversible capacity of 97.8 mAh g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) and a discharge specific capacity of 52.7 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 3200 mA g(-1). This work provides a new idea for the design of high-performance PBAs-based cathodes for AZIBs.

TI A Novel Layered WO3 Derived from An Ion Etching Engineering
   for Ultrafast Proton Storage in Frozen Electrolyte
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Aqueous proton batteries/pseudocapacitors are promising candidates for next-generation electrochemical energy storage. However, their development is impeded by the lack of suitable electrode materials that facilitate rapid transport and storage of protons. Herein, an open-layered hydrous tungsten oxide (WO3 center dot nH(2)O) with larger layer spacing from Aurivillius Bi2WO6 via ion etching is proposed. Particularly, the WO3 center dot nH(2)O electrode possesses a unique multi-level nanostructure and presents superior rate performance (254 F g(-1) at 1000 mV s(-1), surpassing most carbon-based electrode materials known). In situ X-ray Diffraction combined with crystallography study demonstrate that the open layered structure with negligible structural strain enables fast and reversible (de)intercalation of protons during electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, a full proton pseudocapacitor (Prussian blue analogues//WO3 center dot nH(2)O) operating in a wide temperature range from -40 to 25 degrees C is fabricated. This device can deliver 70% of the room-temperature capacitance and stably cycle with negligible capacitance fading over 5000 cycles even in the solid-phase electrolyte at -20 degrees C. This study provides a valuable strategy to design electrode materials with layered structures for the development of high-performance aqueous proton batteries/pseudocapacitors at low temperatures.

TI Commencing an Acidic Battery Based on a Copper Anode with Ultrafast
   Proton-Regulated Kinetics and Superior Dendrite-Free Property
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Building aqueous acidic batteries is in its infancy. There are several sporadic attempts that show desirable electrochemical performance, especially rate stability and high power density. The direct use of a metal anode is regarded as the best protocol for fabricating metal-based batteries. However, introducing an acid-tolerant and electrochemically reversible metal anode into an acidic aqueous battery system remains a considerable challenge. In this work, copper (Cu) metal is used as a reversible metal anode to match acidic regimes with a nearly 100% deposition-dissolution efficiency. The reaction kinetics and mechanism of the Cu anode can be regulated by protons with 400% kinetic acceleration compared with a mild electrolyte. In addition, the anode exhibits a dendrite-free morphology after cycling due to the surface roughening effect, which is different from the morphologies of widely used Zn- and Li-metal anodes. When coupled with the Prussian blue analog as cathodes, the battery delivers ultrafast kinetics of 1830 W kg(-1) at 75 C, which is comparable to the power performance of supercapacitors. Long-term cyclic stability is evaluated, where the capacity retention is 85.6% after 5000 cycles. Finally, flexible fiber-shaped acidic Cu-based batteries are demonstrated for potential wearable applications.

TI Novel Quasi-Liquid K-Na Alloy as a Promising Dendrite-Free Anode for
   Rechargeable Potassium Metal Batteries
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Rechargeable potassium metal batteries are promising energy storage devices with potentially high energy density and markedly low cost. However, eliminating dendrite growth and achieving a stable electrode/electrolyte interface are the key challenges to tackle. Herein, a novel "quasi-liquid" potassium-sodium alloy (KNA) anode comprising only 3.5 wt% sodium (KNA-3.5) is reported, which exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance able to be reversibly cycled at 4 mA cm(-2) for 2000 h. Moreover, it is demonstrated that adding a small amount of sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) into the potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide electrolyte allows for the formation of the "quasi-liquid" KNA on electrode surface. Comprehensive experimental studies reveal the formation of an unusual metastable KNa2 phase during plating, which is believed to facilitate simultaneous nucleation and suppress the growth of dendrites, thereby improving the electrode's cycle lifetime. The "quasi-liquid" KNA-3.5 anode demonstrates markedly enhanced electrochemical performance in a full cell when pairing with Prussian blue analogs or sodium rhodizonate dibasic as the cathode material, compared to the pristine potassium anode. Importantly, unlike the liquid KNA reported before, the "quasi-liquid" KNA-3.5 exhibits good processability and can be readily shaped into sheet electrodes, showing substantial promise as a dendrite-free anode in rechargeable potassium metal batteries.

TI Sulfur codoping enables efficient oxygen electroreduction on FeCo alloy
   encapsulated in N-Doped carbon nanotubes
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Sulfur- and nitrogen-codoped peapod-like carbon nanotubes are facilely prepared via pyrolyzing Fe-and Co-containing Prussian blue analogues supported on trithiocyanuric acid. Combined studies with X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal the encapsulation of metallic FeCo alloy in such carbon nanotubes with a wall thickness of ca. 2.60 nm. Electrochemical measurements show that sulfur codoping with nitrogen dramatically enhances the catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction compared with that of FeCo alloy encapsulated in N-doped only carbon nanotubes, and the sample prepared at a pyrolysis temperature of 800 degrees C is the best one among the series, exhibiting a more positive half-wave potential of +0.838 V, nearly 100% enhancement in kinetic current, a higher operation stability and stronger immunity to the negative impacts of fuel crossover than commercial Pt/C catalysts. The remarkable improvement of catalytic activity is ascribed to the intensified charge transfer from encapsulated FeCo alloy nanoparticles to thin walls of CNTs upon the additional sulfur doping besides nitrogen. The present results highlight the importance of deliberate doping and structuring in the development of more efficient catalysts based on metal nanoparticles encapsulated in CNTs for high-performance electrochemical energy devices.

TI Seed-Assisted Reversible Dissolution/Deposition of MnO2 for
   Long-Cyclic and Green Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Manganese oxide (MnO2) based aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered to be a promising battery for grid-scale energy storage. However, they usually suffer from the great challenge of capacity attenuation due to Mn dissolution and irreversible structural transformation. Herein, full use of the shortcomings is made to design high-performance cathode-free AZIBs. Manganese-based Prussian blue analog (Mn-PBA) is selected as a seed layer to provide a stable MnO2 electrodeposition surface. Thanks to the large specific surface area and manganophilic nature of Mn-PBA, the deposition/dissolution kinetics between Mn2+ and MnO2 are significantly enhanced. Systematic studies revealed the mechanism of MnO2 deposition-dissolution related to the reversible transformation of manganese oxide hydroxide and zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. Based on this, the developed cathode-free AZIBs exhibit outstanding rate performance (with a specific capacity of 273.7 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and extraordinary cycle stability (maintaining a specific capacity of 52.3 mAh g(-1) after 50 000 cycles at 20 A g(-1)). Furthermore, the AZIBs with non-toxic, biocompatible materials can be directly discarded after use, without causing pollution to the environment, which is expected to help achieve the sustainable development goals.

TI WC nanoparticles and NiFe alloy co-encapsulated in N-doped carbon
   nanocage for exceptional OER and ORR bifunctional electrocatalysis
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Developing earth -abundant electrocatalysts with optimized intrinsic active sites is crucial for enhancing bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. In this study, we fabricated a hollow structured carbon framework utilizing NiFe Prussian Blue analogs (PBAs) as templates, while polypyrrole (PPy) and phosphotungstic acid (PW 12 ). Pyrrole monomer underwent polymerization on the nanocubic PBA surface in the presence of PW 12 (PBA@PPy-PW 12 ). Subsequent carbothermal reduction created an N -doped carbon shell with embedded NiFe alloy and tungsten carbide (WC) nanoparticles. The polymeric PPy-PW 12 nature can not only prevent the aggregation of PBA and WC structures but also enhance electrical conductivity by connecting neighboring nanospheres. Moreover, the introduction of WC can significantly enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the carbon -based catalyst, which is attributed to synergism between the WC and NiFe materials within the NC layer. Consequently, NiFe/W 0.3 C@NC exhibited outstanding OER (overpotential = 290 mV for 10 mA/ cm 2 ; Tafel slope = 57 mV/dec) and ORR (half wave potential = 0.81 V; Tafel slope = 61 mV/dec) performances. This work presents a promising avenue for developing high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion systems that showcase remarkable efficiency, stability, and potential practicability.

TI Copper Hexacyanoferrate Solid-State Electrolyte Protection Layer on Zn
   Metal Anode for High-Performance Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Zinc (Zn) metal possesses broad prospects as an anode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) due to its considerable theoretical capacity of 820 mAh g(-1). However, the Zn anode suffers from dendrite growth and side reactions during Zn stripping/plating. Herein, a Prussian blue analog of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) with a 3D open structure and rich polar groups (CN) is coated on Zn foil as a solid-state electrolyte (SSE) protection layer to protect the Zn anode. The CuHCF protection layer possesses low activation energy of 26.49 kJ mol(-1), the high ionic conductivity of 7.6 mS cm(-1), and a large Zn2+ transference number of 0.74. Hence, the Zn@CuHCF||Zn@CuHCF symmetric cell delivers high cycling stability over 1800 h at 5 mA cm(-2), an excellent depth of discharge of 51.3%, and the accumulative discharge capacity over 3000 mAh cm(-2). In addition, the Zn//Ti@CuHCF asymmetric cell achieves the coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.87% after 2000 cycles. More importantly, the Zn@CuHCF//V2O5 full cell presents outstanding capacity retention of 87.6% at 10 A g(-1) after 3000 cycles. This work develops a type of material to form an artificial protection layer for high-performance AZIBs.

TI Anion-cation co-substitution activation of spinel CoMoO4 for
   efficient oxygen evolution reaction
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Developing an efficient earth-abundant catalyst able to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for realizing the scalable application of electrochemical water splitting. Spinel transition metal oxides represent a promising catalyst for this reaction, but to data, their catalytic performance is still further improved to satisfy the practical application. Being different from previous nanostructure engineering and hybridization strategy, herein, we reported an anion-cation co-substitution activation of CoMoO4 for OER through a facile solvothermal treatment of FeCo-Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocube in the presence of thiourea and ammonium molybdate. The combination of experimental results with theoretical analysis uncovered that anion-cation cosubstitution allowed the formation of ultrathin porous nanosheet structure with more accessible active sites, enhanced charge and mass transfer ability and optimized adsorption free energy towards oxygen-containing intermediates. As a result, the Fe and S co-substituted CoMoO4 (Fe0.5Co0.5MoO4-xSx) nanoflowers assembled by nanosheets exhibited a drastically improved OER catalytic activity with an overpotential as low as 263 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1), superior to the state-of-the-art IrO2/C and most reported binary transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts.

TI MOF-on-MOF Derived Co2P/Ni2P Heterostructures for
   High-Performance Supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely used as versatile precursors to fabricate functional nanomaterials with well-defined structures for various applications. Herein, the presynthesized Ni-MOF nanosheets were grown on a Ni foam (NF) substrate, which then guided the nucleation and further growth of Prussian blue analogues (PBA) nanocubes to form MOF-on-MOF of the PBA/Ni-MOF film. This film was subsequently converted into a Co2P/Ni2P heterostructure. The NF-supported Co2P/Ni2P composites exhibited excellent supercapacitor performance, delivering a high specific capacity of 5124.2 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) and a remarkable capacity retention of 80.69% after 3000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using Co2P/Ni2P/NF as the cathode and activated carbon as the anode yielded a maximum energy density of 0.34 mWh cm(-2) at a power density of 1.50 mW cm(-2). The enhanced supercapacitor performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the Ni2P and Co2P components with multiple valence states as well as the unique hierarchical structure, which provides efficient pathways for electron and ion transport while mitigating volume expansion during energy storage. This synthetic strategy demonstrates an effective approach to fabricate phosphide-based hybrid materials for high-performance supercapacitor applications.

TI Criticality of solid electrolyte interphase in achieving high
   performance of sodium-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have shown tremendous application prospects for large-scale energy storage system in recent years due to the abundant natural sodium resources. Notably, the ideal SEI film on the anode of SIBs plays an indispensable role in realizing excellent electrochemical performance. In this work, we report the CoSe2/Fe3C composite derived from Prussian blue analogue as an anode of SIBs, which forms a favorable SEI film within ether-based electrolytes and exhibits excellent electrochemical performance of ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (96.4 % at 2 A/g) as well as long-term cycling life (412.4 mAh/g at 10 A/g over 2000 cycles). We unveil that the favorable SEI layer formed within ether-based electrolytes is rich in inorganics, and thin and dense in microstructure, all of which promote Na+ transport. The formed SEI also has a high Young's modulus to resist the volume variation of active materials during cycling. Moreover, the theoretical molecular orbital analysis suggests that the SEI formation process with ether-based electrolytes is driven by the preferential decomposition of sodium salt prior to the solvent decomposition. Overall, this work underscores the significance and origin of forming a friendly SEI layer to achieve rapid and stable sodium storage.

TI Nano ZIF-67/PBA derived core-shell sulfides or phosphides for enhanced
   electrochemical performance of supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess large specific surface area, high porosity, and adjustable pore size, exhibiting a broad prospect in the field of supercapacitors. However, the poor stability and conductivity of MOFs limited their application in energy storage. The structure of MOF composites and their derivatives are beneficial for storing electric charge and boosting the diffusion of electrolyte ions. In this study, we prepared heterostructured ZIF-67/Prussian blue analogues (PBA) derived sulfides and phosphides using the hydrothermal and solid-phase phosphating method, respectively. The ZIF-67/PBA composites with an average particle size of approximately 1100 nm, retained the rhombic dodecahedral shape of ZIF-67. Compared with MOF-derived phosphides, MOF-derived sulfides more completely retained the rhombic dodecahedron morphology of ZIF67/PBA and demonstrated good electrochemical performance, especially ZPS-3. The unique core-shell nanostructure provides more active sites and suitable ion transport paths for reversible oxidation-reduction reactions. In three-electrode system, the ZPS-3 electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 603.9 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1), superior rate performance, and excellent cycle stability. This study established a new synthesis paradigm for the development of MOF derivatives as a potential class of electrode materials for supercapacitors.

TI Peroxymonosulfate activation by iron-cobalt bimetallic phosphide
   modified nickel foam for efficient dye degradation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Novel catalysts with multiple active sites and rapid separation are required to effectively activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the removal of organic pollutants from water. Therefore, an integrated catalyst for PMS activation was developed by directly forming Co-Fe Prussian blue analogs on a three-dimensional porous nickel foam (NF), which were subsequently phosphorylated to obtain cobalt-iron bimetallic phosphide (FeCoP@NF). The FeCoP@NF/PMS system efficiently degraded dye wastewater within 20 min. The system exhibited excellent catalytic degradation over a broad pH range and at high dye concentrations due to the presence of unique asymmetrically charged Coa+ and Pb- dual active sites formed by cobalt phosphides within FeCoP@NF. These active sites significantly enhanced the catalytic activity of PMS. The activation mechanism of PMS involves phosphorylation that accelerates electron transfer from FeCoP@NF to PMS, to generate SO4 & sdot;-, & sdot;OH, O2 & sdot;-, and 1O2 active species. Three-dimensional FeCoP@NF could be readily recycled and showed good stability for PMS activation. In this study, a highly efficient, stable, and readily recyclable integrated catalyst was developed. This catalyst system effectively resolves the separation and recovery issues associated with conventional powder catalysts and has a wide range of potential applications in wastewater treatment.

TI Metal-organic framework-derived LiFePO4/C composites for
   lithium storage: In situ construction, effective exploitation, and
   targeted restoration
SO ECOMAT
AB Hitherto, LiFePO4 (LFP) is bottlenecked by inferior electronic conductivity and sluggish Li+ diffusion, which can be resolved by cation doping, morphological engineering, carbon coating, and so forth. Among these methodologies, morphological optimization and carbon modification can warrant a stable operating voltage and prolong the cycling lifespan, which can be accessible by utilizing metal-organic frameworks as self-sacrificing templates. Herein, we conceptualize a strategy to in-situ construct N-doped carbon-coated LFP with Prussian blue analogues as the template, after which electrochemical tests extensively exploit the lithium storage capacity with 153.2 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. However, the capacity failure associated with the inevitable Li(+ )loss and destructed carbon layer provides sufficient room for the restoration of LFP after long-term cycling. Motivated by this, the cell performance of LFP/C after targeted restoration using the 3,4-dihydroxybenzonitrile dilithium salt is investigated, revealing a considerable recovered capacity due to the recuperative LFP crystal and uniform carbon layer with homogeneous N-distribution. The computational study also supports the feasibility of N-doped carbon layer in LFP modification. This study envisages a methodology for the performance improvement of LFP from directional fabrication to targeted recovery, providing insights into the manufacturing and reuse of LIB cathodes.image

TI Pre-zeolite framework super-MIEC anodes for high-rate lithium-ion
   batteries
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Zeolites, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) rely on surface-like internal pore diffusions, which have generically low activation barriers to enable the rapid uptake of chemical species. Here we show that Wadsley-Roth oxides (WROs) with pore diameters of 2.5 angstrom < d < 2.8 angstrom, while excluding molecules, enable very rapid diffusion of Li+ in single-crystal particles >10 mu m size. This supports full charge cycles at high rates of similar to 30C, which would rival the filling up of gasoline vehicles, while reducing the contact and side reactions with the electrolyte and enhancing the cycle life up to 10 000 cycles. Pore diffusion in WRO mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIECs) differs from that in lithium intercalation compounds in the off-centered Li storage and low-coordination saddle points for migration. The reduced topological constraints per atom and large free volume in the host also lead to abnormally low or even negative thermal expansion and soft phonons, similar to other open frameworks such as zeolites, PBAs, and MOFs. Based on these guidelines, we have synthesized new composition (Nb9W4Ti4O42.5) and crystal size-coarsened H-Nb2O5 (>20 mu m single crystals) with unprecedented performance.

TI Derivatives of coordination compounds for rechargeable batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Rechargeable batteries are promising electrochemical energy storage devices that play a critical role in portable electronics, hybrid/pure electric vehicles, and smart grids. To achieve improved performance, considerable efforts have been focused on the investigation of new electrode materials. In recent years, coordination compound-derived materials, particularly including metal-organic framework (MOF) derivatives and Prussian blue (PB) derivatives, have received enormous attention as electrode materials of rechargeable batteries because of their nanoporous structure and hierarchical nanostructure. The features of coordination compound derivatives not only can facilitate the transport of the electrolyte, but also shorten the diffusion path of metal ions in the solid-state phase. In this study, we present a review on the recent developments in the application of coordination compound-derived materials (mainly including MOF- and PB-derivatives) in various rechargeable batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-oxygen batteries, and zinc-air batteries. The synthesis, morphological characteristics, and electrochemical properties of the coordination compound derivatives are summarized. Furthermore, future outlooks regarding these developments are proposed.

TI A one-stone-two-birds strategy for cellulose dissolution, regeneration,
   and functionalization as a photocatalytic composite membrane for
   wastewater purification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Photocatalytic membranes integrate membrane separation and photocatalysis to deliver an efficient solution for water purification, while the top priority is to exploit simple, efficient, renewable, and low-cost photocatalytic membrane materials. We herein propose a facile one-stone-two-birds strategy to construct a multifunctional regenerated cellulose composite membrane decorated by Prussian blue analogue (ZnPBA) microspheres for wastewater purification. The hypotheses are that: 1) ZnCl2 not only serves as a cellulose solvent for tuning cellulose dissolution and regeneration, but also functions as a precursor for in-situ growth of spherical-like ZnPBA; 2) More homogeneous reactions including coordination and hydrogen bonding among Zn2+, [Fe (CN)6]3- and cellulose chains contribute to a rapid and uniform anchoring of ZnPBA microspheres on the regenerated cellulose fibrils (RCFs). Consequently, the resultant ZnPBA/RCM features a high loading of ZnPBA (65.3 wt%) and exhibits excellent treatment efficiency and reusability in terms of photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (TC) (90.3 % removal efficiency and 54.3 % of mineralization), oil-water separation efficiency (>97.8 % for varying oils) and antibacterial performance (99.4 % for E. coli and 99.2 % for S. aureus). This work paves a simple and useful way for exploiting cellulose-based functional materials for efficient wastewater purification.

TI Controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry enabled
   highly stable aqueous ammonium-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Aqueous ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs) show great potential in the large scale energy storage systems due to the advantages of low cost, high safety and environmental friendliness. However, they face the challenges of low output voltage and unsatisfactory electrochemical performance because of the narrow voltage window and unstable interfacial structure in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Herein, we design an aqueous AIB based on hydrogen-bond anchored electrolyte, Mn-based Prussian blue analogues (MnHCF) cathode and NaTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3 @- carbon (NTP@C) anode. In this electrolyte, the intermolecular hydrogen-bond interaction is constructed between water and sulfolane molecules, leading to the decreased water activity and wide voltage window. Furthermore, the coordination environment of NH 4 + ions between sulfolane and CF 3 SO 3 - anions produces a unique solvation structure with low hydrated degree, which favors the formation of protective interfacial layer between electrode and electrolyte. Accordingly, the dissolution of MnHCF is largely inhibited and the side reactions between electrode and electrolyte are suppressed. As a result, the MnHCF electrode displays stable cycling performance and high Coulombic efficiency compared with the cases in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Moreover, the constructed full cells demonstrate high output voltage and superior stability. This work provides a synergistic route to design high-performance aqueous AIBs.

TI Hierarchical MXene@PBA nanohybrids towards high-efficiency flame
   retardancy and smoke suppression of robust yet tough polymer
   nanocomposites at ultra-low additions
SO COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING
AB Developing efficient flame-retardant MXene-based polymeric materials with enhanced mechanical properties has been a huge challenge. Herein, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) were used to modify the surface of MXene nanosheets via an electrostatic self-assembly method to construct hierarchical MXene-based nanohybrids (MXene@PBA). Then, MXene@PBA was incorporated into the epoxy matrix to fabricate high-performance epoxy nanocomposites (EP-MXene@PBA). The study indicates that hierarchical MXene@PBA exhibits excellent dispersion performance in the epoxy matrix. Notably, MXene@PBA results in high-efficiency flame retardancy and smoke suppression for epoxy nanocomposites at ultra-low additions. What is very surprising is that only 1.0 wt% MXene@PBA can easily enhance the UL-94 rating of EP-1.0%MXene@PBA to V0. Meanwhile, the peak heat release rate (pHRR), total smoke production (TSP), and peak CO production rate (pCO) are remarkably reduced by 36.70%, 34.28%, and 43.48%, compared to those of the pristine epoxy resin, respectively. Furthermore, the 1.0 wt% MXene@PBA nanohybrids can enhance the flexural and impact strengths of EP-1.0%MXene@PBA. This work provides a feasible strategy for the creation of multifunctional MXene derivatives and their polymeric nanocomposites and holds great promise for many industrial applications.

TI Highly crystalline graphite nanofibers as an anode for high-performance
   potassium-ion batteries
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Graphite is considered the most promising anode for low-cost potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). However, the large volume change and sluggish kinetics due to the large ionic size of K+ cause inferior rate capability and poor cycling stability for the graphite anode. Herein, we report highly crystalline graphite nanofibers (GNFs) as an anode material for PIBs, which deliver flat voltage plateaus with a high specific capacity of 257 mA h g-1. The highly graphitized, fiber-shaped nanostructure not only mitigates the volume expansion caused by K+-intercalation but also facilitates both ionic diffusion and electron transfer. GNFs achieve a long cycle life of 1 year with 99% capacity retention and fast K+-intercalation kinetics. Moreover, the low-defect structure of GNFs ensures a high initial coulombic efficiency of up to 74.23%. A potassium-ion full-cell prototype featuring GNFs anode and Prussian blue analogue cathode demonstrates a high energy efficiency of up to 90.6%. This low-defect graphitic nanofiber may offer insights into the design of carbon-based anodes for PIBs.
   Graphite nanofibres with high crystallinity and low defect levels for potassium-ion batteries with high initial Coulombic efficiency and long cycling stability are reported in this study.

TI Self-assembly hollow magnetoelectric composites emerging tunable
   property between microwave absorption and shielding with light-weight
   and broad bandwidth
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In generally, microwave absorption and shielding are a pair of conjugate properties, which merely achieves in the same system of electro-magnetic materials. In this work, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) derived hollow CoNi@C frames embedding with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are successfully synthesized through a facile self-assembly method. In addition to considerable dielectric loss originating from high conductivity components of C@rGO, magnetic loss is also impressive due to the dynamic magnetic coupling interaction among the closely spaced magnetic units of CoNi. Finally, the CoNi@C@rGO composite with an extremely low loading ratio of 30 wt% reveals a strong reflection loss of - 48 dB and a broad absorption bandwidth of 6.24 GHz concurrently at a thin thickness of 1.6 mm. The launch field is obviously suppressed by covering the CoNi@C@rGO coating and RCS is below - 10 dBm2 within the entire detection angles (-90 degrees < theta < 90 degrees). Meanwhile, superior shielding effectiveness (SE) of 66.2 dB is also achieved in the CoNi@C@rGO composite at 3.59 mm. It demonstrates that our work provides an effective and facile approach to make a transfor-mation between microwave absorption and microwave shielding in the same material system.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Ni-Fe-WSx polynary hollow nanoboxes as promising electrode catalysts for
   high-efficiency triiodide reduction in dye-sensitized solar cells
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Hollow functional materials with adjustable morphologies based on transition metal sulfides have been considered as a class of attractive and promising electrocatalysts for multifarious energy conversion devices. Herein, we adopt a facile template-engaged method to synthesize morphology-tunable Ni-Fe-WSx hollow nanoboxes by changing the mass ratios (1/1, 1/2 and 1/3) of nickel iron Prussian-blue analog precursors and (NH4)(2)WS4. During the above processes, (NH4)(2)WS4 acted as a multifunctional vulcanizator to supply elements of S and W simultaneously and the surface of Ni-Fe-WSx nanoboxes became rougher with the increment of WS42-. Noteworthy, profiting to the moderated surface morphology, appropriate doped ratio and the synergistic effect of multiple elements, Ni-Fe-WSx-2 hollow nanoboxes not only possessed higher specific surface and well-defined interior voids but also performed excellent catalytic properties on promoting the reduction of l3 comparing to Ni-Fe-WSx-1, Ni-Fe-WSx-3 and Ni-Fe-S in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As expected, the DSSC prepared with a Ni-Fe-WSx-2 counter electrode (CE) possessed a higher value of power conversion efficiency (PCE) about 9.86% which was more remarkable than that of Pt (8.20%).

TI Recent progress of layered structured P2-and O3-type transition metal
   oxides as cathode material for sodium-ion batteries
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The demand for grid-scale energy storage devices is increasing extensively nowadays. However, existing energy storage devices, consisting of Nickel-cadmium batteries, Lithium-ion batteries, and Nickel-metal hydride batteries, cannot meet future demands due to irregular dispersal and the high price of the reserves. In this regard, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) that utilize Na-ions in their charge storage mechanism have gained significant consideration due to price advantage and extensive dispersal of sodium reserves in the earth's crust. Due to its significant effect on the electrochemical performance, the cathode materials are considered a key component for SIBs. Up to now, Polyanionic compounds, Prussian blue analogues, Organic materials, and Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) have been investigated as cathode materials for SIBs.

TI Effective Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance of FeCo Alloys In Situ
   Anchored on Nitrogen-Doped Carbon by the Microwave-Assistant Carbon Bath
   Method and Subsequent Plasma Etching
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Electrocatalysts with strong stability and high electrocatalytic activity have received increasing interest for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) in the cathodes of energy storage and conversion devices, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries. However, there are still several bottleneck problems concerning stability, efficiency, and cost, which prevent the development of ORR catalysts. Herein, we prepared bimetal FeCo alloy nanoparticles wrapped in Nitrogen (N)-doped graphitic carbon, using Co-Fe Prussian blue analogs (Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), Co-Fe PBA) by the microwave-assisted carbon bath method (MW-CBM) as a precursor, followed by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment. This novel preparation strategy not only possessed a fast synthesis rate by MW-CBM, but also caused an increase in defect sites by DBD plasma treatment. It is believed that the co-existence of Fe/Co-N sites, rich active sites, core-shell structure, and FeCo alloys could jointly enhance the catalytic activity of ORRs. The obtained catalyst exhibited a positive half-wave potential of 0.88 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an onset potential of 0.95 V vs. RHE for ORRs. The catalyst showed a higher selectivity and long-term stability than Pt/C towards ORR in alkaline media.

TI Mn-based cathode materials for rechargeable batteries
SO SCIENCE CHINA-CHEMISTRY
AB The rapid expansion of renewable energies asks for great progress of energy-storage technologies for sustainable energy supplies, which raises the compelling demand of high-performance rechargeable batteries. To satisfy the huge demand from the coming energy-storage market, the resource and cost-effectiveness of rechargeable batteries become more and more important. Manganese (Mn) as a key transition element with advantages including high abundance, low cost, and low toxicity derives various kinds (spinels, layered oxides, polyanions, Prussian blue analogs, etc.) of high-performance Mn-based electrode materials, especially cathodes, for rechargeable batteries ranging from Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries, aqueous batteries, to multivalent metal-ion batteries. It is anticipated that Mn-based materials with Mn as the major transition-metal element will constitute a flourishing family of Mn-based rechargeable batteries (MnRBs) for large-scale and differentiated energy-storage applications. On the other hand, several critical issues including Jahn-Teller effect, Mn dissolution, and O release greatly hinder the pace of MnRBs, which require extensive material optimizations and battery/system improvements. This review aims to provide an investigation about Mn-based materials and batteries for the coming energy-storage demands, with compelling issues and challenges that must be overcome.

TI Phytic acid-modified NiFe-PBA stacked by π-π force for reinforcement
   electrocatalytic water oxidation
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with a unique three-dimensional (3D) open metal framework structure and easily adjustable composition have been widely used in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Herein, disintegrative PA-tPBA/NF (d-PA-tPBA/NF) was prepared by an ion-exchange reaction, phytic acid (PA) etching and mild thermal activation using Ni(OH)2 layered nanosheets loaded on nickel foam (NF) as a precursor. Due to the optimization of the NiFe-PBA@Ni(OH)2 heterostructure and pi-pi stacking force on the electron transfer structure, a stable high-speed charge transfer channel has been successfully constructed. Therefore, the OER overpotential required to transport 10 mA cm-2 is only 250 mV, especially with a significant Tafel slope of 47.9 mV dec-1. Furthermore, the d-PA-tPBA/NF||d-PA-tPBA/NF system achieved a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with a cell voltage of only 1.55 V. This study provides a promising strategy for exploring efficient OER electrocatalysts derived from PBAs.
   We synthesized NiFe-PBA@Ni(OH)2 hierarchical heterostructure catalysts. Due to the chelation of PA and pi-pi stacking force, the overall water splitting of 10 mA cm-2 requires only 1.55 V low cell voltage.

TI Alkaline-based aqueous sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy
   storage
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Aqueous sodium-ion batteries are practically promising for large-scale energy storage, however energy density and lifespan are limited by water decomposition. Current methods to boost water stability include, expensive fluorine-containing salts to create a solid electrolyte interface and addition of potentially-flammable co-solvents to the electrolyte to reduce water activity. However, these methods significantly increase costs and safety risks. Shifting electrolytes from near neutrality to alkalinity can suppress hydrogen evolution while also initiating oxygen evolution and cathode dissolution. Here, we present an alkaline-type aqueous sodium-ion batteries with Mn-based Prussian blue analogue cathode that exhibits a lifespan of 13,000 cycles at 10 C and high energy density of 88.9 Wh kg-1 at 0.5 C. This is achieved by building a nickel/carbon layer to induce a H3O+-rich local environment near the cathode surface, thereby suppressing oxygen evolution. Concurrently Ni atoms are in-situ embedded into the cathode to boost the durability of batteries.
   Aqueous sodium-ion batteries show promise for large-scale energy storage, yet face challenges due to water decomposition, limiting their energy density and lifespan. Here, the authors report a cathode surface coating strategy in an alkaline electrolyte to enhance the stability of both electrolyte and battery.

TI Precursor design in a self-templating strategy for carbon-encapsulated
   bimetallic CoFe catalysts: Boosting organic pollutant degradation via
   nonradical pathways
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Designing high-performance heterostructure catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation is a promising research area. PMS-driven organic pollutant degradation via radical pathways usually suffers from the inter-ference of other coexisting matters. In this study, we took a source design approach and employed a self-templating strategy using Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursors to fabricate CoFe/C heterostructure catalysts dominated by a nonradical pathway. Slow-speed coordination renders the CoFe PBA precursor with a highly ordered crystal structure and fewer coordinated water, resulting in an ideal carbon-encapsulated CoFe bimetallic catalyst (CoFe-S-T) with more high-valence metals and a graphitized carbon layer in its heterostructure; the obtained catalyst is proven to have superior catalytic performance for tetracycline (TC) degradation through a nonradical pathway in PMS-driven oxidation. The high CoIII/CoII ratio and surface oxygen content make CoFe-S-T an excellent catalyst by boosting the generation of 1O2, which is the predominant active species. In addition, CoFe-S-T has a high proportion of graphitized carbon layers, which significantly improves the direct electron transfer pathway. Thus, utilizing precursor design in a self-templating strategy is an effective method to syn-thesize high-performance heterostructures for PMS-driven organic pollutant degradation.

TI Self-templated and triethanolamine-induced hollow MnO2 nanoboxes with
   abundant active Mn3+and oxygen vacancies for high-performance Na-ion
   pseudocapacitors
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The electrochemical performance of MnO2 is limited by its low surface area, sluggish kinetics, and poor stability. Herein, hollow MnO2 nanoboxes (H-MnO2-TEA) are successfully prepared using Prussian blue analogs (KMn[Fe(CN)6], Mn-PBA) via a facile triethanolamine-induced strategy to tackle the abovementioned hurdles. Mn-PBA not only acts as a self-sacrificial template, but also triggers the "self-redox reaction" to in-situ form MnO2, in which the dissociated [Fe(CN)6]3- oxidates Mn2+ in the alkalic medium. Besides, triethanolamine is employed as an intermediate modulator to induce the formation of hollow MnO2 and adjust the coordination environment of H-MnO2-TEA. Experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrate that abundant active Mn3+ and oxygen vacancies in H-MnO2-TEA are beneficial to providing more active sites, improving electrical con-ductivity, and boosting Na+ diffusion kinetics. Based on the improved structural and electrical properties, H-MnO2-TEA delivers a high specific capacitance of 316.8 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, superior rate performance, and excellent capacitive retention of 96.1 % after 10,000 cycles. This work provides an efficient way to construct hollow metal oxides for high-performance energy storage devices along with their underlying mechanism.

TI 3D hollow Co-Fe-P nanoframes immobilized on N,P-doped CNT as an
   efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting
SO NANOSCALE
AB The rational design of nonprecious and high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts with advanced structural and compositional preponderance for water electrolysis is of paramount importance for the generation of sustainable and clean energy. Herein, for the first time, a novel three-dimensional (3D) hollow hybrid electrocatalyst, Co-Fe-P nanoframe immobilized on N,P-doped carbon nanotubes (CoFeP NFs/NPCNT), was synthesized by selectively etching a CNT-composited Co,Fe-based Prussian blue analogue and subsequent phosphorization. Benefiting from its unique 3D hollow nanoarchitecture, which offers rich porosity and abundant catalytically active sites and guarantees excellent conductivity and structural stability, the hollow CoFeP NFs/NPCNT hybrid delivered pronounced catalytic activity for oxygen evolution (or hydrogen evolution) in alkaline electrolyte, with a low overpotential of 278 (or 132) mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 39.5 (or 62.9) mV dec(-1) and prominent long-term stability. Therefore, when CoFeP NFs/NPCNT was employed as the cathode and anode toward overall water-splitting, it required a quite small cell voltage of only 1.56 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and displayed outstanding electrocatalytic stability over 60 h, greatly approaching the performance of the commercial Pt/C (-)//RuO2(+) electrolyzer and outperforming most other non-noble-based electrolyzers.

TI Ligand Mediated Assembly of CdS Colloids in 3D Porous Metal-Organic
   Framework Derived Scaffold with Multi-Sites Heterojunctions for
   Efficient CO2 Photoreduction
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The inclusion of colloidal particles into 3D porous constructs to realize heterostructure ensembles enhances surface interactions and energy transfer that can transform the catalytic properties of conventional catalysts. However, assembling hydrophobic colloidal nanoparticles within hydrophilic 3D porous matrices to create tailored heterostructures and catalytic properties is particularly challenging. Here, a modified ligand grafting method is presented to spontaneously assemble CdS inorganic colloidal quantum dots within a metal-organic framework (MOF) derived porous framework for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The grafted long chain molecular ligands effectively suppress phase separation and endow a molecular-recognition effect to form ordered assembly microstructures. The proof-of-concept assembly of CdS and Prussian blue analogues (PBA) derived Co3O4 facilitates a high density of heterojunctions formation, improving charge transfer and extended lifetimes of photo-induced electrons. Consequently, CdS/Co3O4 assembly exhibits exceptionally active and stable photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity, with a CO production rate of 73.9 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and CO selectivity of 98.9%. Importantly, the ligand grafting method can be generalized to achieve spontaneous assembly of quantum dots within various metal organic framework derived porous scaffolds. This work provides a rational strategy for precise self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles within porous microstructures, allowing tailored heterointerfaces for functional materials and applications.

TI Metal-organic framework-derived ZnO/ZnCo2O4
   microspheres modi fied by catalytic PdO nanoparticles for sub-ppm-level
   formaldehyde detection
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB Designing novel structures and selecting the right catalyst play significant roles to overcome the inherent limitations of chemical sensors. The transition metal-organic framework is one of the most promising precursors for the development of advanced gas sensors with high porosity. In this work, novel ZnO/ZnCo2O4 hetero-structured microspheres synthesized from a Zn-Co-Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor is rationally designed by changing the temperature of thermal treatment and the decoration of PdO nanoparticles is carried out by a water bath strategy. Formaldehyde-sensing properties of the sensors based on pure ZnCo2O4 NPs, ZZCO-500, ZZCO-700, and PdO-ZZCO microspheres are studied in detail. The experiment results show that the PdO-ZnO/ZnCo2O4 microsphere-based sensor has a higher response value (about 26.9), better selectivity (S-formaldehyde/S-ethanol = 5) and rapid response and recovery (9/14 s) towards 100 ppm formaldehyde as well as a low detection limit (0.2 ppm). The improvement in formaldehyde-sensing properties could be attributed to the larger specific surface areas (SSA), abundant active sites, the heterojunctions and the catalytic effect of PdO nanoparticles. This work provides a feasible method for synthesizing MOF-derived hetero-structured nanomaterials, demonstrating the potential application for monitoring indoor air pollutants.

TI Hydroxylation strategy unlocking multi-redox reaction of manganese
   hexacyanoferrate for aqueous zinc-ion battery
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), as one of the most promising cathodes due to their open framework and high working voltage (similar to 1.75 V vs Zn/Zn-2+) for rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (RAZIBs), commonly suffer from poor reversible capacity owing to single redox center. Here, a hydroxylation strategy is proposed for activating inactive redox pair of Mn(II)/Mn(III) in manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) to supply extra capacity. As a result, OH - rich MnHCF cathode renders a high discharge capacity of 136.1 mAh/g (at 100 mA g(-1)) and a considerable energy density of 228.8 Wh kg(-1) benefiting from the unlocked multi-redox reaction, which is much better than the OH - poor MnHCF (58.3 mAh/g and 52.6 Wh kg(-1), respectively). Furthermore, the abundant hydroxyl in OH-rich MnHCF can continuously activate the multi-redox centers to provide high capacity in the subsequent cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that abundant hydroxyl functional group favors to capture Zn2+ on the sites near Mn atoms, thereby facilitating the activation of Mn-redox reaction. This study offers new opportunities for exploiting cathodes with both high working voltage and discharge capacity for RAZIBs.

TI General Synthesis of Hierarchically Macro/Mesoporous Fe,Ni-Doped
   CoSe/N-Doped Carbon Nanoshells for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen
   Evolution
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Constructing hierarchical porosity and designing rational hybrid composition are effective strategies for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of hybrid catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion. Here, we develop a multistep "molecule/ion-exchange" strategy toward the synthesis of hierarchically macro/mesoporous Fe,Ni-doped CoSe/N-doped carbon nanoshells with tunable pore structures and compositions. Polystyrene (PS)@Co-based amorphous coordination polymer (Co-CP) core-shell particles with hierarchically macro/mesoporous nanoshells are first prepared by ligand-molecule-exchange etching of the outer layers in PS@Co-based metal-organic framework precursors. Afterward, a liquid-solid dual-ion-exchange reaction of PS@Co-CP particles with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) and [Ni(CN)(4)](2-) ions leads to the formation of PS@Co-CP/Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA)/Co-Ni PBA particles, which are further transformed into hierarchically macro/mesoporous Fe,Ni-doped CoSe/N-doped carbon particles via a vapor-solid selenization reaction. Moreover, this approach could be extended to synthesize different hierarchically porous core-shell composites with various morphologies and tailored compositions. Because of their unique hierarchically porous nanoarchitecture, these Fe,Ni-doped CoSe/N-doped carbon particles with optimized composition show enhanced performance for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution.

TI Simultaneous biosensing of catechol and hydroquinone via a
   truncated cube-shaped Au/PBA nanocomposite
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB A simultaneous testing of the trace catechol (CC) and hydroquinone (HQ) was achieved via an ultrasensitive phenolic biosensor constructed by the truncated cube-shaped gold/Prussian blue analogue (Au/PBA) nano-composites. A facile charge-assembly strategy was developed to drive the successive mutual attractions for the crystallization among [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), Co2+, and [AuCl4](-) reactants, benefiting the in-situ growth of Au nano-particles on all faces of the PBA truncated nanocubes. On account of this special architecture, numerous 10 nm Au particles can rapidly gather the electrons from the enzyme reaction to a PBA crystal due to their high conductivity, and then the current signals will be significantly magnified through the reversible redox of the PBA. Using this nanomaterial, the as-prepared biosensor has shown an extreme wide linear range (CC: 0.2-550 mu M, HQ: 1-550 mu M) and an ultralow detection limit (CC: 0.06 +/- 0.001 mu M, HQ: 0.3 +/- 0.007 mu M) for the independent detections of CC and HQ. More importantly, when the two targets coexist, this biosensor can simultaneously exhibit the obvious and accurate responses of CC and HQ at the different potentials (0.17 V for CC and 0.07 V for HQ) with the high sensitivities and rare mutually interferences.

TI Self-template sacrifice and in situ oxidation of a constructed hollow
   MnO2 nanozymes for smartphone-assisted colorimetric detection of liver
   function biomarkers
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Liver function tests play a vital role in accurately diagnosing liver diseases, monitoring treatment outcomes, and assessing liver damage severity. Here, we introduce a novel approach to develop a smartphone-assisted portable colorimetric sensor for rapid detection of three liver function biomarkers: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). This sensor is based on the inherent enzyme like activities of hollow MnO2 (H-MnO2). The H-MnO2 is synthesized via a self-template sacrifice and in situ oxidation strategy, utilizing a manganese-based Prussian blue analogue (Mn-PBA) as a sacrificial template. The resulting H-MnO2 exhibits a polycrystalline structure with a large specific surface area. By encapsulating the H-MnO2 in sodium alginate, we construct a portable sensing platform facilitating specific and rapid colorimetric detection of the three liver function biomarkers with the assistance of a smartphone. The developed sensor demonstrates outstanding sensitivity and stability, achieving detection limits of 4.9 U L-1, 3.6 U L-1, and 0.99 U L-1 for AST, ALT, and ALP, respectively. Importantly, this work introduces an innovative in situ oxidation method for fabricating hollow nanozymes, offering a cost-effective and convenient assay for liver function biomarkers detection.

TI Heteroatom Modification of Heterostructured
   CuS/Mn3O4with Rich Defects for Solid-State
   Supercapacitors
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB Heterostructure construction and heteroatom mod-ification are considered as effective approaches to modulate theelectronic structure and boost the energy storage activity ofelectrode materials. Herein, oxygen-modified CuS/Mn3O4(O-CuS/Mn3O4) heterogeneous nanoflakes with abundant defects arefabricated by solid-state grinding followed by NaBH4treatment(NBHT) at room temperature using MnCu Prussian blue analogue(MnCu-PBA) as the precursor. During the NBHT, a portion of thesulfur atoms in CuS is removed, and the remaining sites in thelattice are occupied by oxygen in the water, resulting in an oxygenmodification. Experimental results and theoretical calculationsconfirm that heterojunction, defect, and oxygen modification notonly greatly facilitate the adsorption of OH-on the surface of theelectrode material but also endow improved electrical conductivity, wettability, specific surface area, and active sites. Benefiting fromthese advantages, O-CuS/Mn3O4exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 1307 F g-1at 1 A g-1. Moreover, the solid-stateasymmetric supercapacitor with O-CuS/Mn3O4and MnO2(O-CuS/Mn3O4//MnO2) shows an outstanding energy density of 34.4Wh kg-1at 800.1 Wmiddotkg-1and cyclic stability with 85.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 6 A g-1. Our work highlights theintegration of heterojunction and oxygen modification to fabricate and optimize the energy storage electrode materials.

TI Binary active sites of nickel-iron alloy bonded in nitrogen-doped carbon
   nanocage for robust durability and low polarization zinc-air batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The industrialization of rechargeable metal-air batteries, especially zinc-air batteries (ZABs), is greatly limited to the low efficiency, high polarization, and short lifetime of oxygen catalysts (both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction), which still faces challenges. Herein, a novel efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst based on binary active sites engineering of NiFe alloy embedded in hierarchical nanoporous nitrogen-doped carbon nanocage (NiFe@NC) is successfully synthetized by pyrolysis of urea and Prussian blue analogues coated with polydopamine. Profiting from strong synergetic between NiFe alloy and nitrogen-doped carbon, abundant Fe/Ni-N-C bond, this unique hierarchical yolk-core-shell structure provides an integration of superior OER and ORR property, half-wave potential of 0.86 V for ORR and a small overpotential of 277 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. Consequently, the liquid ZABs based on the electrocatalyst exhibits a high open-circuit voltage of 1.50 V, a low-polarization voltage of 0.68 V after 370 hat 10 mA cm(-2), as well as superior stability for up to 750 h (10 mA cm(-2)) and 450 h (20 mA cm(-2)). This work provides a reference significance to the research and development of high-performance rechargeable ZAB catalysts.

TI A hierarchical hollow Ni/Co-functionalized MoS2 architecture
   with highly sensitive non-enzymatic glucose sensing activity
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB A hierarchical hollow Ni/Co-codoped MoS2 architecture was successfully prepared using a Ni/Co Prussian Blue analogue as the precursor followed by the solvothermal-assisted insertion of MoS42- and extraction of [Co(CN)(6)](3-) at 200 degrees C for 32 h. The obtained Ni/Co-codoped MoS2 composite exhibited a hollow microcubic structural characteristic, and the morphology, structure, and chemical compositions were carefully characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The Ni/Co-codoped MoS2 composite used as an electrode material featured excellent glucose sensing activity and a high sensitivity of 2546 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) with a relatively low detection limit of 0.69 mu M (S/N = 3). In addition, the Ni/Co-codoped MoS2 composite showed good anti-interference sensing performance in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA), lysine (Lys), cysteine (Cys), urea, H2O2, KCl, and other interferents. These experimental results revealed that the composite is a promising electrode material for enzyme-free glucose sensing, and the feasible synthetic strategy may provide an effective and controlled route to prepare other multi-metal substituted sulfide-based hierarchical structures with high electrochemical sensing performance.

TI Topotactically constructed nickel-iron (oxy)hydroxide with abundant
   in-situ produced high-valent iron species for efficient water
   oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB The low efficiency of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is regarded as one of the major roadblocks for metal-air batteries and water electrolysis. Herein, a high-performance OER catalyst of NiFe0.2 (oxy)hydroxide (NiFe0.2-OxHy) was developed through topotactic transformation of a Prussian blue analogue in an alkaline solution, which exhibits a low overpotential of only 263 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1). Ex-situ/operando Raman spectroscopy results indicated that the phase structure of NiFe0.2-OxHy was irreversibly transformed from the type of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) to gamma-NiOOH with applying an anodic potential, while ex-situ/operando Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopic studies evidenced the in-situ production of abundant high-valent iron species under OER conditions, which effectively promoted the OER catalysis. Our work elucidates that the amount of high-valent iron species in-situ produced in the NiFe (oxy)hydroxide has a positive correlation with its water oxidation reaction performance, which further deepens the understanding of the mechanism of NiFe-based electrocatalysts.

TI Fe-Doped Ni/Co-Based Selenide Hierarchical Nanosheet Arrays as
   Self-Supporting Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Overall Water
   Splitting
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB It is necessary to optimize the electrocatalytic activity of an electrocatalyst by means of morphology and composition regulation. Herein, Fe-doped bimetallic selenide hierarchical nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam (Fe-NiCoSe/NiCoSe/NF) are obtained for overall water splitting. The Fe-NiCoSe/NiCoSe/NF is fabricated by selenizing the NiCoFe Prussian blue analogue (NiCoFe-PBA) growing on a NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH). Benefiting from the hierarchical nanosheet arrays, the synergistic effect of the bimetallic selenides, as well as the electronic structure rearrangement caused by Fe-doping, the Fe-NiCoSe/NiCoSe/NF catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 120 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 199 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA<middle dot>cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. In addition, when used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, the Fe-NiCoSe/NiCoSe/NF requires a cell voltage of 1.93 V (1.82 V) to reach 100 mA<middle dot>cm(-2) (50 mA<middle dot>cm(-2)). Additionally, Fe-NiCoSe/NiCoSe/NF exhibits prolonged durability lasting for 150 h at 10 mA<middle dot>cm(-2). This work provides a reasonable idea for designing a hierarchical nanostructured bifunctional electrocatalyst toward overall water splitting by regulating the structure and composition.

TI SnO2 shells-induced rich Co<SUP>2+</SUP> sites and oxygen
   vacancies in FexCo3-xO4
   nanocubes: Enhanced peroxymonosulfate activation performance for water
   remediation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Cobalt-based heterogeneous composites, as promising peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activators for water remediation, usually suffer from the less reactive sites and metal leakage unfavorable for environmental application. Herein, the well-designed FexCo3-xO4@SnO2 nanocubes are successfully constructed by calcinating Fe-Co prussian blue analogue coated with Sn(OH)Cl. The formation of SnO2 shells preserves the nanocubic microstructure of FexCo3-xO4 to enlarge the specific surface area and induces the generation of rich Co2+ and oxygen vacancy sites on the FexCo3-xO4 surface. The synergy of Co2+ sites and oxygen vacancies contributes to the efficient adsorption and activation of PMS molecules, resulting in the generation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals as the dominant reactive species for bisphenol A removal. Through adjusting the thickness of SnO2 shells, the optimal composite, FexCo3-xO4@SnO2-2 exhibits the excellent catalytic performance for PMS-involved reaction as compared to the conventional iron/cobalt-based oxides. Moreover, SnO2 shells can effectively inhibit the metal ions leaching during catalytic reaction, which is of great significance for reducing the secondary pollution to water bodies. This study develops a new strategy to regulate the oxygen vacancy sites and inhibit the metal leaching of cobalt ferrites, offering a step forward in the design of high efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for water remediation.

TI Co3[Fe(CN)6]2 nanocube derived
   architecture of Co,Fe co-doped MoS2 nanosheets for efficient
   water electrolysis
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Developing nonprecious and high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalyst towards overall water splitting is of fundamental importance for future renewable fuel system and is still a big challenge. MoS2 is regarded as a promising candidate, but effective techniques are lacking to simultaneously settle the obstacles of limited site density and intrinsic activity, which still restrict its practical application. Herein, we address such challenges via activating MoS2 with Co,Fe co-doping and nanostructure engineering techniques through a template confined strategy. Using Prussian blue analogue (PBA) of Co-3[Fe(CH)(6)](2) nanocubes as self-sacrifice template not only guides the specific geometry of Co,Fe co-doped MoS2 (Co,Fe-MoS2) nanosheets assembled architecture, but also achieves the Co,Fe co-doping. Nanosheets assembled architecture supplies structural benefits of high surface area, short charge transfer path, and easily accessible active sites. The Co,Fe co-doping induces defects as additional catalytic sites and alters the electronic structure of active sites. When used as bifunctional catalysts for water electrolysis, Co,FeMoS2 shows excellent catalytic activity with a low cell potential of 1.49 Vat a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In a two-electrode electrolyzer, only one single-cell AA battery could afford the sustainable overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Coupling pentlandite nanoparticles and dual doped carbon networks to
   yield efficient and stable electrocatalysts for acid water oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The ability to develop [ow-cost eLectrocataLysts with high efficiency and strong stabiLity for acid oxygen evolution reactions (OER) will enable commerciaL applications of powerful proton exchange membranes (PEM) in water splitting devices. However, this remains challenging because most nonprecious metal based eLectrocataLysts suffer from strong corrosion in acid media. Herein, we crafted porous N, S-doped carbon network-immobilized uLtrafine pentlandites (i.e., Ni4Fe5S8) nanoparticLes (denoted P-NSC/ Ni4Fe5S8-1000) by employing rationally designed nanohybrids comprised of Liquid polymer-coated binary Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanoparticLes (NPs) as precursors. Afterwards, the P-NSC/Ni4Fe5S81000 nanocomposites were exploited as OER eLectrocataLysts, with a small onset potentiaL of 1.53 V vs. RHE (1 mA cm(-2)) and strong stabiLity in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, outperforming commerciaL RuO2 eLectrocataLysts. As revealed by both experimental results and DFT calculations, there is a synergy effect on the P-NSC/Ni4Fe5S8-1000 for OER: the pyridinic-N, S doped carbon could easily adsorb water, and then the highly active Fe sites of Ni4Fe5S8 NPs could catalyze the absorbed water to oxygen gas. Furthermore, the hierarchically porous nanostructure could promote multiphase transport during acid OER. Therefore, this work, for the first time, highlighted the great potentiaL of pentlandites NPs-based nanocomposites as efficient and stable eLectrocataLysts for acid OER.

TI Nitrogen-doped carbon-decorated yolk-shell CoP@FeCoP micro-polyhedra
   derived from MOF for efficient overall water splitting
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Designing efficient non-precious electrocatalysts to facilitate overall water splitting is crucial and highly desirable but remains challenging. In this study, we synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon-decorated CoP@FeCoP yolkshelled micro-polyhedras (denoted as CoP@FeCoP/NC YSMPs) via the phosphorization of ZIF-67@Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues YSMPs. The yolk-shelled construction and nitrogen-doped carbon matrix can effectively reduce the degree of CoP agglomeration, which is beneficial for increasing the specific surface area and active sites of the catalysts. The synergistic effect of yolk-shelled structure and nigtrogen-doped carbon matrix also optimizes the electronic structure and enhances the electrocatalytic activity of CoP@FeCoP/NC YSMPs. In an alkaline electrolyte, the overpotentials of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction only need 141 and 238 mV, respectively, to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When a two-electrode water splitting device was conducted with the as-prepared catalyst, it required only a low cell voltage of 1.68 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and displayed outstanding stability over 20 h. This work offers insights into the facile, controllable synthesis strategy of various non-precious metal nanomaterials for high-efficiency water splitting electrocatalysis.

TI Adsorptive removal of trace thallium(I) from wastewater: A review and
   new perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Thallium is an emerging pollutant reported in wastewater along with the increasing mining and smelling of thallium-containing ores in recent years. The complete removal of Tl(I) from wastewater is of significant emergency due to its high toxicity and mobility, however, Tl(I) removal is always confronted with numerous technical difficulties because of the extremely low Tl(I) concentration in wastewater and the disturbances of many accompanying impurity ions. Adsorption is currently the most widely used method for Tl(I) removal on industrial scale and varied kinds of adsorbents such as Prussian blue analogues, biosorbents, and metal oxides have been developed. However, the adsorption process of Tl(I) is always affected by the co-existing cations, resulting in low Tl(I) removal efficiency. Recently, the development of a variety of novel adsorbents or ion sensors based on macrocyclic compounds for enrichment and accurate determination of trace Tl(I) in aqueous solutions exhibits great potential for application in Tl(I) removal from wastewater with high selectivity and process efficiency. This paper provides an overview of the adsorption methods for Tl(I) removal from wastewater with emphasis on complexation properties between varied types of adsorbents and Tl(I). Future directions of research and development of adsorptive Tl(I) removal from industrial wastewater are proposed.

TI Bicarbonate ions promote rapid degradation of pollutants in
   Co(II)Fe(II)/ peroxyacetic acid systems
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Peroxyacetic acid (PAA), as an oxidizing agent, has gained significant attention in the field of advanced oxidation because of its low toxicity and high degradation capacity. In this study, cobalt-iron-based Prussian blue analogs (Co-PBAs) were utilized for the first time to activate PAA for tetracycline degradation. In the Co-PBAs/PAA system, organic radicals (RO center dot) and high-valent metal oxides are mainly produced. TC is efficiently removed in a wide pH range (5-9) and a variety of interferences (Cl-, SO42-, bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), humic acid, and the actual water bodies) in water bodies due to the specificity of RO center dot. Interestingly, the catalytic rate of the Co-PBAs/ PAA system was significantly accelerated in the presence of HCO3- (k obs increasing from 0.171 min- 1 to 0.534 min- 1 ). This enhancement is attributed to the reaction between HCO3- and PAA, and carbonate radicals (center dot CO3-) and acetyl peroxyl radicals (CH3C(O)OO center dot) are generated and then react with the phenolic hydroxyl group of TC. In this study, the mechanism of PAA activation by Co-PBAs was revealed, and PAA-based advanced oxidation process enhanced by HCO3- was provided for the removal of pollutants from wastewater.

TI Activating a Multielectron Reaction of NASICON-Structured Cathodes
   toward High Energy Density for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The increasing demand to efficiently store and utilize the electricity from renewable energy resources in a sustainable way has boosted the request for sodium-ion battery technology due to the high abundance of sodium sources worldwide. Na superionic conductor (NASICON) structured cathodes with a robust polyanionic framework have been intriguing because of their open 3D structure and superior thermal stability. The ever-increasing demand for higher energy densities with NASICON-structured cathodes motivates us to activate multielectron reactions, thus utilizing the third sodium ion toward higher voltage and larger capacity, both of which have been the bottlenecks for commercializing sodium-ion batteries. A doping strategy with Cr inspired by first-principles calculations enables the activation of multielectron redox reactions of the redox couples V2+/V3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+, resulting in remarkably improved energy density even in comparison to the layer structured oxides and Prussian blue analogues. This work also comprehensively clarifies the role of the Cr dopant during sodium storage and the valence electron transition process of both V and Cr. Our findings highlight the importance of a broadly applicable doping strategy for achieving multielectron reactions of NASICON-type cathodes with higher energy densities in sodium-ion batteries.

TI Encapsulating CoS2-CoSe2 heterostructured
   nanocrystals in N-doped carbon nanocubes as highly efficient counter
   electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Designing low-cost electrocatalysts combining the features of outstanding catalytic activity, excellent electrical conductivity, and high chemical stability remains a critical challenge for the large-scale fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here we report the controlled synthesis of CoS2-CoSe2 hetero-structured nanocrystals encapsulated in N-doped carbon hollow nanocubes (CoS2-CoSe2@NC) through simultaneous sulfurization and selenization of polydopamine coated Prussian blue analogs. Benefiting from both structural and compositional characteristics, namely, the synergistic effect of CoS2-CoSe2 heterojunctions, the conductive N-doped carbon coating and the porous structure of the nanocubes, the resultant CoS2-CoSe2@NC nanocubes exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and cycling stability toward the generation of I-3-ions in DSSCs. A typical device achieves a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.45% under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm(-2)), superior to that of a standard Pt-based device (8.07%). These results demonstrate that the as-synthesized CoS2-CoSe2@NC nanocubes are promising alternatives to Pt in DSSCs. The work represented here not only provides a promising strategy to design efficient and robust CE catalysts, but also can be extended for synthesizing other novel metal sulfide/selenide hybrid materials for applications in the fields of energy conversion and storage.

TI Ionic Liquid-Softened Polymer Electrolyte for Anti-Drying Flexible Zinc
   Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Using solid polymer electrolytes has been proven to be an efficient strategy to address the metal dendrites and pursuing high-voltage performance. Polyethylene oxide (PEO), as a popular polymer matrix, hardly works for zinc ion batteries due to its poor zinc ionic conductivity and the poor interfacial adhesion. Here, an ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([Emim]OTF), was applied as a plasticizer to tune the room-temperature ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of PEO membrane electrolyte. Additional nanofillers ZnO were utilized to enhance the plasticity and modulus. With an optimized composition, the membrane exhibits a high modulus and soft mechanics, which can facilitate the reversible stripping/plating of Zn without formation of Zn dendrites. The optimized polymer electrolyte achieved an ionic conductivity of 2.3 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature with a softness of 5.1 mm. By applying the resulted soft membrane electrolyte for a Zn-MnO2 battery, a capacity of 137 mAh g(-1) is achieved at 30 mA g(-1) even without the contribution from H+. Such an electrolyte also works for Prussian blue analogue cathodes. Importantly, the addition of [Emim]OTF can enhance the soft contact with the electrodes, and a stable output is delivered under severe deformations for the assembled flexible devices.

TI Surface selenium doped hollow heterostructure/defects Co-Fe sulfide
   nanoboxes for enhancing oxygen evolution reaction and supercapacitors
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The strategy of constructing a three-dimensional hierarchically porous architecture with heterointerface and defects to rich the electrochemically active site, and rapid electron transfer has been considered as an effective strategy to achieve the excellent electrochemical performance in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Herein, a Se-doped hollow heterostructure/defects Co-Fe sulfide (Se-(CoFe)S-2) box has been developed via a facile sulfurization-selenization treatment of hollow Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues precursor. Remarkably, the abundant hierarchical macro-mesopores of hollow Se-(CoFe)S2 nanobox with excellent structural stability and unique electrical properties can not only effectively expose the electrochemically accessible active sites but also significantly improve the electrolyte transport and electron transfer, thus boosting electrochemical performances in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors in alkaline media. For OER, the Se-(CoFe)S-2 electrocatalyst shows a small overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 51.8 mV dec(-1) as well as high stability. Furthermore, it also shows good performance for supercapacitors, suggesting its great potential as an efficient electrode for sustainable energy applications. Superb properties highlight the great prospects of PBA-based derivatives in applications of energy storage and conversion. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Biomimetic 3D Fe/CeO2 decorated N-doped carbon nanotubes
   architectures for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been regarded as one of the most promising systems for next-generation rechargeable batteries owing to their high energy density and low cost. However, the "Shuttle effect" of poly-sulfides and low sulfur utilization upon cycling are still hindering their practical applications. Herein, we report a series of marine organism-like hollow nanoarchitecture consisting of nitrogen (N) doped 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which were derived from binary Fe/Ce Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) and melamine. This nitrogen-doped 3D hollow scaffold offers large inner space (phi approximate to 200 nm) and sufficient electric conducting for insulating sulfur and provides adsorption sites for immobilizing polysulphides. The introduced double metal species enable strong chemical adsorption toward polysulfides and could facilitate the redox reaction between sulfur and polysulphides. When applied in Li-S batteries, the as-prepared materials showed a high capacity of 1241 mAh g(-1) and a stable cycling performance (1003 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles) at a current density of 0.2 C. The enhancement of electrochemical activity could be attributed to the 3D hollow architecture of the hybrid, in which the nitrogen-doping generates defects and active sites for improved interfacial adsorption. This work could inspire developing biomimetic architectures for high-performance Li-S batteries.

TI Determination of cesium using nickel hexacyanoferrate by stripping
   voltammetry
SO ANALYST
AB The determination of cesium ions (Cs+) is important for various applications, including resource utilization, environmental monitoring, and human health. Electrochemical sensors, with their inherent advantages, stand out as an ideal choice for Cs+ detection. However, electrode materials for Cs+ sensors usually face problems such as poor selectivity and complex synthesis. Herein, a method employing nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) as the electrode material for stripping voltammetry in the determination of Cs+ was proposed. Both adsorption and electrochemical intercalation exhibited selectivity. In the presence of interfering ions at a 10 : 1 molar ratio to Cs+, Cs+ was still preferentially intercalated in NiHCF. However, electrochemical intercalation exhibits superior selectivity for Cs+ compared to adsorption. Meanwhile, the effect of adsorption on the detection was minimized by electrochemical intercalation. Based on the standard addition method, Cs+ was determined using both adsorption and electrochemical intercalation methods. The error reduced significantly from 32.7% above the theoretical value through adsorption to 9.5% below the theoretical value through electrochemical intercalation. This approach not only enhanced the measurement accuracy but also reduced the costs associated with both measurement and preparation. The study proposed a cost-effective and rapid method for Cs+ measurement using Prussian blue analogs.

TI C-CoP hollow microporous nanocages based on phosphating regulation: a
   high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water
   splitting
SO NANOSCALE
AB Developing economic, effective and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts to achieve sustainable hydrogen production is highly desired. Herein, C-coated CoP hollow microporous nanocages (C-CoP-1/12) are synthesized by calcination of a Prussian blue analog precursor and subsequent phosphorization treatment. Under alkaline condition, the C-CoP-1/12 exhibit splendid electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 173 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 333 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The C-CoP-1/12 show high electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting at a low potential of only 1.650 V for the driving current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and they exhibit remarkable stability for at least 24 h. The engineering of phosphating is the critical step for the synthesis of pure-phase CoP with hollow nanoarchitecture. Compared with Co2P, CoP possesses lower water dissociation barrier and favorable Delta G(H)* value according to theoretical calculations, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance. Such impressive water splitting performance is mainly attributed to the collective effects of metal phosphide with unique electronic structure, the shortened electron transport paths, and the conductive C coating. This strategy is believed to provide a basis for the development of electrode materials with highly efficient electrocatalytic water-splitting capability.

TI Electrospun carbon nanofibers loaded with sulfur vacancy CoS2
   as separator coating to accelerate sulfur conversion in Lithium-Sulfur
   batteries
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been sought after by researchers owing to their high energy density; however, the inevitable capacity decay and slow reaction kinetics have hindered their advancement. Here, we prepare a Prussian blue analog, Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) and synthesize carbon nanofibers/S vacancy CoS2-x (CNFs/CoS2-x) as electrocatalysts for separator coating via electrospinning, carbonization, sulfurization, and hydrogen reduction. CNFs/CoS2-x exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity, wherein S vacancies induce the partial oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ in CoS2 and CNFs provide long-range electron transport pathways. Various electrochemical tests, such as Tafel, ion diffusion coefficient, Li2S precipitation, and Li2S6 symmetric cells, further confirm the enhanced electrocatalytic activity. The LSBs with CNFs/CoS2-x modified separator delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1056.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, maintaining 840.8 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C. When S loading is increased to 4.42 mg cm(-2), the battery retains a discharge capacity of 687.9 mAh g(-1) (3.04 mAh cm(-2)) after 70 cycles at 0.1C. Our work can provide a reference for synthesizing anion-vacancy materials and designing anion-vacancy electrocatalytic composites for LSBs.

TI Cold plasma-activated Cu-Co catalysts with CN vacancies for enhancing
   CO2 electroreduction to low-carbon alcohol
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction to low-carbon alcohol is a challenging task, especially high selectivity for ethanol, which is mainly limited by the regulation of reaction intermediates and subsequent C- C coupling. A Cu-Co bimetallic catalyst with CN vacancies is successfully developed by H2 cold plasma toward a high-efficiency CO2RR into low-carbon alcohol. The Cu-Co PBA-VCN (Prussian blue analogues with CN vacancies) electrocatalyst yields methanol and ethanol as major products with a total lowcarbon alcohol FE of 83.8% (methanol: 39.2%, ethanol: 44.6%) at -0.9 V vs. RHE, excellent durability (100 h) and a small onset potential of -0.21 V. ATR-SEIRAS (attenuated total internal reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy) and DFT (density functional theory) reveal that the steric hindrance of VCN can enhance the CO generation from *COOH, and the C-C coupling can also be increased by CO spillover on uniformly dispersed Cu atoms. This work provides a strategy for the design and preparation of electrocatalysts for CO2RR into low-carbon alcohol products and highlights the impact of catalyst steric hindrance to catalytic performance. & COPY; 2023 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI High-Voltage Zinc-Ion Batteries: Design Strategies and Challenges
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have recently attracted attention for applications in energy storage systems owing to their intrinsic safety, low cost, environmental compatibility, and competitive gravimetric energy density. To enable the practical applications of ZIBs, their energy density must be equivalent to the existing commercial lithium-ion batteries. To acquire high-energy density, increasing the operating voltage of the battery is undoubtedly an effective method, which demands cathode material to exhibit a high voltage versus Zn2+/Zn, while matching a highly reversible anode and an electrolyte with a sufficiently wide electrochemical stability window. This review focuses on the design strategies and challenges towards high-voltage ZIBs. First, the basic electrochemistry of ZIBs and the recent progress in various high-voltage cathode materials for ZIBs, including Prussian blue analogs, polyanionic compounds, and metal-based oxides are introduced.

TI Novel Mn3[Co(CN)6]2@SiO2@Ag
   Core-Shell Nanocube: Enhanced Two-Photon Fluorescence and Magnetic
   Resonance Dual-Modal Imaging-Guided Photothermal and Chemo-therapy
SO SMALL
AB The versatile Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)@SiO2@Ag core-shell NCs are prepared by a simple coprecipitation method. Ag nanoparticles with an average diameter of 12 nm deposited on the surface of Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)@SiO2 through S-Ag bonding are fabricated in ethanol solution by reducing silver nitrate (AgNO3) with NaBH4. The NCs possess T-1-T-2 dual-modal magnetic resonance imaging ability. The inner Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) exhibit bright two-photon fluorescence (TPF) imaging when excited at 730 nm. Moreover, the TPF imaging intensity displays 1.85-fold enhancement after loading of Ag nanoparticles. Besides, the sample also has multicolor fluorescence imaging ability under 403, 488, and 543 nm single photon excitation. The as-synthesized Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)@SiO2@Ag NCs show a DOX loading capacity of 600 mg g(-1) and exhibit an excellent ability of near-infrared (NIR)-responsive drug release and photothermal therapy (PTT) which is induced from the relative high absorbance in NIR region. The combined chemotherapy and PTT against cancer cells in vitro test shows high therapeutic efficiency. The multimodal treatment and imaging could lead to this material a potential multifunctional system for biomedical diagnosis and therapy.

TI Unraveling the Active Sites on Mesoporous
   CuFe2O4@N-Carbon Catalysts with Abundant Oxygen
   Vacancies and M-N-C Content for Boosted Nitrogen Reduction Toward
   Electrosynthesis of Ammonia
SO SMALL
AB Transition metal centers dispersed over nitrogen-doped carbon (M-NC) supports have been widely explored for electrocatalytic reactions; however, sparsely reported for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR). Particularly, the single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown reasonable ammonia yield rate and faradaic efficiency (FE), but their complex synthesis and low durability for long-term electrocatalysis runs restrict their use on a larger scale. Importantly, the catalytic active sites in metal nanostructured-based M-NC catalysts toward enhanced N-2 adsorption and activation are still not clear as they are highly challenging to reveal. A few studies have predicted that the surface oxygen vacancies (O-vac) favor an enhanced ENRR performance. Herein, a strategy using tailored M-NC content and O-vac in a single catalyst for enhanced ammonia electrosynthesis is devised. A mesoporous bimetallic spinel oxide (CuFe2O4) supported over N-doped carbon (CuFe2O4@NC) derived from Prussian blue analog (PBA) via controlled pyrolysis possess is found to show boosted ENRR activity. Moreover, operando NH3 formation over the catalyst is observed using four electrode set up. This approach enables rapid evaluation ofelectrocatalytic efficacy and avoids false positive results. The rotating disc electrode results reveal that mass transport in acidic media and surface absorption in alkline media primarily regulate ENRR over CuFe2O4@NC electrocatalyst.

TI Highlighting the Reversible Manganese Electroactivity in Na-Rich
   Manganese Hexacyanoferrate Material for Li- and Na-Ion Storage
SO SMALL METHODS
AB The electroactivity of sodium-rich manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) material constituted of only abundant elements, as insertion host for Li- and Na-ions is herein comprehensively discussed. This material features high specific capacities (>130 mAh g(-1)) at high potentials when compared to other materials of the same class, i.e., Prussian blue analogs. The reversible electronic and structural modifications occurring during ion release/uptake, which are responsible for such high specific capacity, are revealed herein. The in-depth electronic and structural analysis carried out combining X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), demonstrates that both Fe and Mn sites are involved in the electrochemical process, being the high delivered capacity the result of a reversible evolution in oxidation states of the metallic centers (Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mn2+/Mn3+). Along with the Mn2+/Mn3+ oxidation, the Mn local environment experiences a substantial yet reversible Jahn-Teller effect, being the equatorial Mn-N distances shrunk by 10% (2.18 angstrom -> 1.96 angstrom). Na-rich MnHCF material offers slightly higher performance upon uptake and release of Na-ions (469 Wh kg(-1)) than Li-ions (457 Wh kg(-1)), being, however, the electronic and structural transformation independent of the adopted medium, as observed by XAS spectroscopy.

TI Hierarchical Superhydrophilic/Superaerophobic
   Ni(OH)2@NiFe-PBA Nanoarray Supported on Nickel Foam for
   Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The design of hierarchical electrocatalysts with plentiful active sites and high mass transfer efficiency is critical to efficiently and sustainably carrying out the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which presents a challenging and pressing need. In this study, a hierarchical Ni(OH)(2)@NiFe-Prussian blue analogue nanoarray grown on nickel foam (NF) [labeled as Ni(OH)(2)@NiFe-PBA/NF] was synthesized by combining a mild electrodeposition method with an ion-exchange strategy. The resultant Ni(OH)(2)@NiFe-PBA/NF displays superhydrophilic/superaerophobic properties that optimize the contact with the electrolyte, improve mass transfer efficiency, and expedite detachment of O-2 bubbles during the electrocatalytic OER. Specifically, Ni(OH)(2)@NiFe-PBA/NF exhibits exceptional capability in the OER with low overpotentials of 224 and 240 mV at the current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, accompanied by a low Tafel slope of 37.1 mV dec(-1) and outstanding stability over 100 h at a fixed potential of 1.78 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Furthermore, Ni(OH)(2)@NiFe-PBA/NF demonstrates remarkable OER performance even in alkaline simulated seawater. During the OER process, active metal-OOH intermediates were formed by the partial self-reconstruction of NiFe-PBA in the heterostructure, as revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy.

TI Phase-Induced Strain Effect to Synthesize an Iron-Doped Orthogonal
   Cobalt Selenide Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The etching effect has the capability to control atom doping and trigger phase transformation, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic reaction. Herein, iron-doped cobalt selenide (Fe-CoSe2) nanoparticle-decorated carbon nanofibers (Fe-CoSe2/CNFs) are synthesized by assembling an FeCo-Prussian blue analogue (FeCo-PBA) cube precursor with polyacrylonitrile fibers and then treating with hydrochloric acid, followed by gas phase selenization. The Fe-CoSe2/CNFs catalyst exhibits a large surface area and a porous structure, facilitating the permeation of electrolytes. Moreover, orthorhombic CoSe2 is obtained, which is in favor of improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By modulating the etching time, the ideal crystal phase and the optimal amount of the dopant (Fe) can be achieved, thus showing favorable OER activity. Specifically, the Fe-CoSe2/CNFs electrocatalyst enables high electrocatalytic activity for the OER with a low overpotential of 263 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. A small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1) shows fast charge transfer kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Fe-doped orthorhombic CoSe2(111) can modulate the electron structure, contributing to OH- adsorption ability. Given this, a strategy for phase transformation induced by etching technology is proposed to improve the intrinsic activity of the catalyst.

TI Enabling extreme low-temperature proton pseudocapacitor with tailored
   pseudocapacitive electrodes and antifreezing electrolytes engineering
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A critical current challenge in the development of proton pseudocapacitors is developing antifreezing electrolytes and high-performance proton storage materials in extreme environments. Here, we design an antifreezing proton pseudocapacitor using a high-concentration phosphoric acid electrolyte and pseudocapacitive electrode materials, which delivers an outstanding rate capacity and cycle life below - 40 degrees C. Comprehensive physical characterization techniques and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the solvation structure of the electrolyte defines the freezing point and electrochemical stability window, which is crucial for achieving fast charge carrier mobility and avoiding side effects. The pseudocapacitive hydrated tungsten oxide anodes and Prussian blue analogue cathodes with their open crystal structures achieve fast proton transport and storage, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance from - 60 to 25 degrees C (1000 cycles with no capacity fading at - 40 degrees C). Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the electrolyte and electrode materials, the fabricated proton pseudocapacitors exhibit remarkable low-temperature electrochemical performance. It achieves a maximum energy density of 39 Wh kg-1 and a broadened electrochemical window from 1.7 V at 25 degrees C to 2.3 V at - 60 degrees C. This work provides a comprehensive strategy to develop high-performance proton energy storage devices under ultralow-temperature conditions.

TI Superiority of a novel flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI)
   based on a battery material at high applied voltage
SO DESALINATION
AB Flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) provides the opportunity for continuous desalination operation of high concentration saline water. In this study, we firstly report the application of a battery material (a Prussian blue analogue, copper hexacyanoferrate, CuHCF) as flowable electrode in FCDI system, where it is coupled with activated carbon (AC). Its desalination performance under different voltage is evaluated when dealing with 10 g L-1 NaCI solution. Results show that the salt removal rate and salt removal efficiency of the designed FCDI is enhanced as increasing in applied voltage from 1.2 to 2.8 V. Moreover, benefiting from the high capacity of CuHCF material, the novel FCDI based on CuHCF-AC pair shows superiority over conventional FCDI with AC-AC pair when operates at high voltage over 2.0 V (e.g. salt removal rate of 0.12 vs. 0.11 mg cm(-2) min(-1), salt removal efficiency of similar to 91 vs. 84% and current efficiency of similar to 96 vs. 95% at 2.8 V), even though the pH of the concentrated water changes more significantly. The results indicate that FCDI based on CuHCF-AC electrode pair is effective in dealing with high saline water at high voltage. Other sodium ion intercalation material may also be applied in FCDI.

TI Research Progress on Iron-Based Materials for Aqueous Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO BATTERIES-BASEL
AB Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) represent a promising battery technology for stationary energy storage, due to their attractive merits of low cost, high abundance, and inherent safety. Recently, a variety of advanced cathode, anode, and electrolyte materials have been developed for ASIBs, which not only enhance our fundamental understanding of the Na insertion mechanism, but also facilitate the research and development of practical ASIB systems. Among these electrode materials, iron-based materials are of particular importance because of the high abundance, low price, and low toxicity of Fe elements. However, to our knowledge, there are no review papers that specifically discuss the properties of Fe-based materials for ASIBs yet. In this review, we present the recent research progress on Fe-based cathode/anode materials, which include polyanionic compounds, Prussian blue, oxides, carbides, and selenides. We also discuss the research efforts to build Fe-based ASIB full cells. Lastly, we share our perspectives on the key challenges that need to be addressed and suggest alternative directions for aqueous Na-ion batteries. We hope this review paper can promote more research efforts on the development of low-cost and low-toxicity materials for aqueous battery applications.

TI Patterned interlayer enables a highly stable and reversible sodium metal
   anode for sodium-metal batteries
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB The cycle-life of the sodium metal anode in carbonate-based electrolytes is severely challenged by the irreversible consumption of the metal anode and electrolyte inventory. Although ether-based electrolytes can extend the cycle life, their high flammability poses serious safety challenges. Carbonate-based electrolytes are engineered through fluorinated organic additives to minimize consumption; this leads to gradual decay in the capacity due to unwanted side reactions. Here, we present a patterned polypropylene interlayer (PPIL) to stabilize the sodium metal anode in a carbonate-based electrolyte without needing organic additives. The PPIL helps to minimize electrolyte consumption in carbonate- and ether-based electrolytes. With the optimized patterned design and thickness of the PPIL, the Na metal anode could function reversibly for an unprecedented 9000 cycles at a relatively high current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the carbonate-based electrolyte. Moreover, the sodium metal anode survives in the ether-based electrolytes for over 2000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). We demonstrate the feasibility of developing a stable and long-lasting sodium-metal battery comprising Na-PPIL//Prussian blue analogue that operates at room temperature and lasts more than 250 cycles without significantly losing capacity. This work highlights the significance of the patterned interlayers in stabilizing the sodium metal anode, irrespective of the chemistry of the electrolytes.

TI Ultrafast Li-ion migration in eggshell-inspired 2D@2D dual porous
   construction towards high rate energy storage
SO CARBON
AB The rate performance of lithium-ion batteries is vital to their practical applications in electronics and vehicles, but impeded by limited migration of Li+ and electrons in solid anode materials. Inspired by the double-layer porous structure, a calciferous outer layer elegantly grown on a protein inner layer, of air-penetrable eggshells, a new composite is designed to have a 2D@2D dual porous architecture consisting of 2D holey graphene (hG) and 2D porous ZnFe2O4 nanobelts (ZFOnb@hG). In the composite Zn-Fe hybrid Prussian blue analog was transformed into 2D porous ZnFe2O4 nanobelts on a holey graphene matrix which acts as both template and substrate. The hG matrix in the dual porous structure can minimize Li+/electron transfer pathways and the 2D porous nanobelts consisting of ultrafine ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles (3-4 nm) can efficiently buffer the volume change in both lateral and thickness directions during lithiation/delithiation. The resultant composite ZFOnb@hG exhibited an ultrahigh capacity of 1305 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1) and outstanding rate performance with excellent cycling stability of 703 mA h g(-1) retained after 10000 cycles at 10 A g(-1). This biomimetic study opens up a new avenue for the development of high-capacity anode materials towards fast-charging capabilities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hierarchical composite CoFe-K/GC@MnO2@MXene for excellent
   electromagnetic wave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Electromagnetic wave absorption (EMWA) materials with qualities such as low cost, thin thickness, and high efficiency are of tremendous value in addressing the challenges posed by EMW pollution. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a nanoflower-like composite from the Prussian blue analog KCoFe(CN)6 through a combination of hydrothermal and post-annealing methods. Subsequently, we prepared the hierarchical composite CoFe-K/GC@MnO2@MXene (CMM) by electrostatic self-assembly with few-layered Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. Their chemical compositions, microstructures, and EMWA performances were thoroughly investigated. The CMM composite demonstrated outstanding EMWA performance with an impressive minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value of -53.0 dB at 1.68 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) value of 4.0 GHz with an ultrathinmatching thickness of only 1.55 mm. The exceptional EMWA performance of CMM can be attributed to the increased conductive loss, enhanced interfacial polarization, and optimized impedance matching. Simulated radar cross-section (RCS) plots confirm the outstanding RSC reduction achieved by the CMM absorber coating. Furthermore, the EAB can be extended to 12.12 GHz by designing a macro 3D quadrangular frustum pyramid structural model for the absorber. The practical application potential of CMM was also enhanced by its good heat dissipation capability, which was demonstrated in real-time using an infrared thermal imager. This work provides a novel insight into developing efficient and multifunctional EMWA materials for practical applications.

TI Synthesis of novel hollow carbon nanotubes @ Co-Fe alloy/iron
   phthalocyanine electrocatalyst by self-assembly method for OER and ORR
   study
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB The exploration of an inexpensive catalyst with effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities to replace precious metal electrocatalysts has been of great interest in recent years. In this paper, CNT@Co-Fe/FePc composites were synthesized with high efficiency using a self-assembly strategy. In the synthesis process, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized as the base material using crab shells as templates and honey as the carbon and nitrogen source. CoFe alloy nanoparticles derived from CoFe-based prussian blue analogs were self-assembled and anchored on CNTs, and then iron phthalocyanine with Fe-N-4 portion was coupled with CNTs by pi-pi stacking. Finally formed a homogeneous and stable composite material. The self-assembly method is simple and efficient to achieve good metal loading. The prepared CNT@Co-2-Fe-1/ FePc exhibits excellent catalytic performance and stability for OER and ORR in alkaline electrolyte. The overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) of CNT@Co-2-Fe-1/FePc for OER is 343 mV with a very small Tafel slope of 43.59 mV dec(-1). CNT@Co-2-Fe-1/FePc has high methanol tolerance and persistence for ORR. This work provides a strategy for the construction of transition metal-carbon composite electrocatalytic materials with excellent catalytic performance and stability for OER and ORR reactions.

TI A closed-loop recovery strategy of unsaturated polyester composite:
   Bridging heterogeneous catalyst and resin by noncovalent interactions
SO COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Heterogeneous catalysis has been shown to effectively degrade organic pollution. However, it is challenging to degrade the thermosetting unsaturated polyester resin (UPR) because the contact mode between heterogeneous catalyst and resin leads to an inefficient degradation. Meanwhile, the inevitable degradation products also cause the generation of waste chemicals. Herein, the efficient degradation and closed-loop recovery strategy of UPR composite were carried out by enhancing the contact areas through bridging heterogeneous catalyst and resin. Based on hydrolysis reaction, the controllable decomposition of crosslinking UPR was utilized to yield carboxyl-rich and hydroxy-rich copolymers, forming a porous structure. With the induction of tertiary butanol (tBuOH), a heterogeneous bimetallic Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue catalyst was thus immobilized onto the hydrolyzed resin due to the hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals force, which confirmed by experiment and theoretical calculation. The catalyst subsequently activated H2O2 to generate radicals that could effectively degrade resin by triggering strong chemical bond cleavage. It was optimized that more than 90% UPR was decomposed at 100 C below. Notably, the remarkable nondestructive recovery process of woven carbon fiber (CF) from composite was well demonstrated. The recycled CF and its reinforced composite exhibited more than 90% strength retention to the virgins. Besides, the degradation products were employed into waterborne coating with superior properties. This work provides an efficient and feasible catalytic strategy for closed-loop recovery of UPR composite.

TI Precise electronically modulated Mn doped nickel iron phosphate with P,
   N codoped carbon decorated P-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose for
   efficient electrocatalytic glucose conversion coupled with H2 generation
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Biomass electrocatalytic-conversion coupled with hydrogen generation exhibits low energy consumption, efficient hydrogen production and green syntheses of value-added chemicals. However, constructing electrocatalysts with precise electronic modulation and structures for efficient biomass electrocatalytic conversion coupled hydrogen production remains challenging. Herein, a bacterial cellulose substrate was combined in situ with a Mn-doped NiFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursor, and one-step carbonization-phosphorylation was developed for the preparation of Mn-doped nickel iron phosphate (MNFP) embedded in a P, N codoped carbon (PNC) substrate grown directly on P-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose (MNFP-PNC/PCBC). Benefiting from the three-dimensional network structure of P-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose (PCBC) and atomic doping, MNFP-PNC/PCBC exhibited an optimized electronic structure, abundant active sites and excellent electrical conductivity. Therefore, the voltages required with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and glucose electrocatalytic-conversion (GCR) to drive a current density of 50 mA cm-2 were 0.214, 1.5, and 1.34 V, respectively. Moreover, the required cell voltage of the novel electrolyser containing MNFP-PNC/PCBC as electrodes can be further reduced to 1.55 V at 50 mA cm-2 compared to overall water splitting, resulting in more than 8-time improvement in hydrogen production efficiency and production of valueadded formate. This work provides a unique approach for electrocatalytic-conversion of biomass coupled with electrocatalytic hydrogen generation.

TI Regulating the Spin State Configuration in Bimetallic Phosphorus
   Trisulfides for Promoting Sulfur Redox Kinetics
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the poor conductivity of sulfur cathodes and polysulfide shutting. Current studies on sulfur redox catalysis mainly focus on the adsorption and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides but ignore the modulation of the electronic structure of the catalysts which involves spin-related charge transfer and orbital interactions. In this work, bimetallic phosphorus trisulfides embedded in Prussian blue analogue-derived nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanocubes (FeCoPS3/NCs) were elaborately synthesized as a host to reveal the relationship between the catalytic activity and the spin state configuration for Li-S batteries. Orbital spin splitting in FeCoPS3 drives the electronic structure transition from low-spin to high-spin states, generating more unpaired electrons on the 3d orbit. Specifically, the nondegenerate orbitals involved in the high-spin configuration of FeCoPS(3 )result in the upshift of energy levels, generating more active electronic states. Such tailored electronic structure increases the charge transfer, influences the d-band center, and further modifies the adsorption energy with lithium polysulfides and the potential reaction pathways. Consequently, the cell with FeCoPS3/NC host exhibits an ultralow capacity decay of 0.037% per cycle over 1000 cycles. This study proposed a general strategy for sculpting geometric configurations to enable spin and orbital topology regulation in Li-S battery catalysts.

TI Electronic engineering of amorphous Fe-Co-S sites in hetero-nanoframes
   for oxygen evolution and flexible Al-air batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are key electrochemical processes in metal-air batteries and water splitting devices. Aluminium-air batteries, as an important type of metal-air battery, have been considered to be promising power candidates for flexible electronics. Here, we describe electronically engineered amorphous Fe-Co-S sites embedded in Prussian blue analogue (FeCoSx-PBA) hetero-nanoframes. The experimental results and DFT calculations reveal the critical role of the introduced FeCoSx layer to PBA, which enhances the electron transfer and alleviates the overbinding effect of OH* during the OER. The FeCoSx-PBA hybrid system supplies an optimized electronic structure for the alkaline OER, which is also confirmed by the much-lowered overpotential (266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for the alkaline OER. Furthermore, a flexible Al-air battery based on an FeCoSx-PBA cathode catalyst exhibits a high peak power density (58.3 mW cm(-2)) and energy density (1483 W h kg(Al)(-1)), and outstanding stability for more than 50 h of operation under bending or stretching conditions, demonstrating its potential in the practical application of flexible electronic devices. Our results may provide a new strategy of modulating the electronic structure of air electrode catalysts to efficiently promote the reactivity of alkaline OER and Al-air battery processes.

TI Synthesis of hierarchical porous δ-MnO2 nanoboxes as an
   efficient catalyst for rechargeable Li-O2 batteries
SO NANOSCALE
AB A rechargeable lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) battery with a remarkably high theoretical energy storage capacity has attracted enormous research attention. However, the poor oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER) activities in discharge and charge processes cause low energy efficiency, poor electrolyte stability and short cycle life. This requires the development of efficient cathode catalysts to dramatically improve the Li-O-2 battery performances. MnO2-based materials are recognized as efficient and low-cost catalysts for a Li-O-2 battery cathode. Here, we report a controllable approach to synthesize hierarchical porous delta-MnO2 nanoboxes by using Prussian blue analogues as the precursors. The obtained products possess hierarchical pore size and an extremely large surface area (249.3 m(2) g(-1)), which would favour oxygen transportation and provide more catalytically active sites to promote ORR and OER as the Li-O-2 battery cathode. The battery shows enhanced discharge capacity (4368 mA h g(-1)@0.08 mA cm(-2)), reduced overpotential (270 mV), improved rate performance and excellent cycle stability (248 cycles@500 mA h g(-1) and 112 cycles@1000 mA h g(-1)), in comparison with the battery with a VX-72 carbon cathode. The superb performance of the hierarchical porous delta-MnO2 nanoboxes, together with a convenient fabrication method, presents an alternative to develop advanced cathode catalysts for the Li-O-2 battery.

TI Ligand-induced hollow binary metal-organic framework derived Fe-doped
   cobalt-carbon nanomaterials for oxygen evolution
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB There is significant anticipation for high-efficiency and cost-effective non-precious metal-based catalysts to advance the industrial application of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for hydrogen production. This study introduces an efficient strategy that utilizes ligand-induced metal-organic framework (MOF) building blocks for the synthesis of hollow binary zeolitic imidazolate frameworks 67 (ZIF-67) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (ZIF-67@PBA) heterostructures through a hybrid MOF-on-MOF approach. Manipulating the Co2+/Zn2+ ratio in the precursor ZIF-67 allows for the convenient synthesis of the final product, denoted as CoxFe-ZP, after pyrolysis, where the inclusion of Zn effectively modulates the distribution of Co in the catalyst. The resulting CoxFe-ZP catalysts exhibit a positive synergistic effect between hollow graphitic carbon nanomaterials and Fe-doped Co nanoparticles. The optimal Co0.3Fe-ZP catalyst demonstrates satisfactory OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 302 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 60.0 mV dec(-1). Further analysis of the activation energy confirms that the enhanced OER activity of Co0.3Fe-ZP can be reasonably attributed to the combined influence of its morphology and composition. This study demonstrates a ligand-induced method for examining the morphology and electrochemical properties of grown binary MOF-on-MOF heterostructures for OER applications.

TI Electrolyte solvation structure manipulation enables safe and stable
   aqueous sodium ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Aqueous sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) have been limited by their poor electrochemical stability. The use of highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes is considered as an efficient strategy that increases the voltage window and improves the cycling stability. However, their cost and safety are still subjects of serious concern for practical applications. In this work, we show that a new multi-component aqueous electrolyte (MCAE) could widen the voltage window to 2.8 V with the formation of a composite solvent sheath and promote the generation of a uniform solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer consisting of complexes with inorganic salt Na(2)CO(3)and other organic components, which significantly inhibits the side reaction. Thus, this MCAE guaranteed good electrochemical stability of Na3V2(PO4)(3)and NaTi2(PO4)(3), which suffer from severe performance degradation in aqueous electrolytes. Simultaneously, this MCAE exhibits high safety, a wide operating temperature range (-50 degrees C to 50 degrees C) and high ionic conductivity because of urea andN,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) additives. In addition, a nickel-based Prussian blue analog (NiHCF)/NaTi2(PO4)(3)sodium-ion full battery using such a MCAE delivers 80% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 2C rate. Moreover, our work provides important guidelines to investigate safe, environmentally friendly and high-stability ASIBs for large-scale energy storage.

TI Accelerated arsenic decontamination using graphene oxide-supported
   metal-organic framework nanoconfined membrane for sustainable
   performance
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Developing highly efficient bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalysts for Fenton-like reactions holds significant promise for decontamination processes. Although MOFs with excellent decontamination capabilities are achievable, ensuring their long-term stability, especially in the organoarsenic harmless treatment, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we proposed a unique nanoconfinement strategy using graphene oxide (GO)-supported Prussian blue analogs (PBA) as catalytic membrane, which modulated the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in p-arsanilic acid (p-ASA) degradation from traditional radical pathways to a synergy of both radical and non-radical pathways. This dual-pathway activation with sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was a significant advancement, ensuring the exceptionally high reactivity and stability for over 80 h of continuous membrane operation. The PBA@GO membrane achieved a degradation rate constant of 0.79 ms(-1), with an increase of four orders of magnitude compared to the nonconfined PBA@GO composites, while ensuring comprehensive arsenic removal ensuring comprehensive arsenic removal and demonstrating remarkably efficient total organic carbon elimination (92.2 % versus 57.6 % in 20 min). The PBA@GO membrane also showed excellent resistance towards inorganic ions, humic acid, and complex water matrices. This facile and universal strategy paves the way for the fabrication of MOFs-based catalytic membranes for optimizing performance in arsenic pollution treatment.

TI Synthesis of ternary Ag/ZnO/ZnFe2O4 porous and
   hollow nanostructures with enhanced photocatalytic activity
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Highly uniform Ag/ZnO/ZnFe2O4 ternary composites with porous and hollow nanostructures are synthesized using Ag-loaded Prussian blue analogue Zn3Fe(CN)(6)center dot xH(2)O (Ag-ZnPBA) as the precursor via a facile calcination process. The cubic morphology of the precursor is well inherited after the calcination process. The microstructures of the ternary composites can be tuned from porous to hollow interiors by simply changing the heating modes. The loading amount of Ag in the composites can be adjusted by controlling the initial adsorption amount of Ag+ ions on the metal-organic framework of ZnPBA. The as synthesized ternary Ag/ZnO/ZnFe2O4 shows significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of organic dye as compared to the binary counterpart of ZnO/ZnFe2O4, demonstrating the important role of Ag for the photocatalytic process. It seems that the combination of the three components of Ag, ZnO, ZnFe2O4 can form type-II band alignment and Schottky barrier, which would inhibit the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. Moreover, benefited from the excellent magnetic property of ZnFe2O4, the composite photocatalysts can be easily recovered from reaction systems by a magnet. This work presents a facile and effective route for the construction of uniform multi-component nanocomposites with intriguing structures and multiple functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI Cathode materials for non-aqueous calcium rechargeable batteries
SO NANOSCALE
AB Calcium rechargeable batteries based on divalent charge carriers have the potential to meet the future demands for large-scale energy storage applications, due to the crustal abundance of Ca element and the high capacity and high safety of Ca metal anodes. The discernible progress in electrolyte and anode materials has put calcium battery technology a step closer to practice. However, the pursuit of high-voltage, high-capacity and stable cathode materials had been formidable because of the sluggish ion migration kinetics and the instability of host lattices during Ca2+ insertion and extraction. Unlocking the potential of Ca rechargeable batteries particularly hinges on the strategic identification of high-performance cathode materials. Herein, this review summarizes the representative strategies to develop novel cathode materials that allow reversible accommodation of Ca2+ ions for high energy output. The cathode materials can be classified into intercalation-type (layered structure, polyanionic compounds, and Prussian blue analogues) and conversion-type (organic materials, sulfur, and oxygen). The scrutinization of their performances and drawbacks sheds light on the current stage of cathode material advancement and provides informative suggestions for future studies to develop advanced calcium rechargeable batteries with competitive performance.
   Calcium rechargeable batteries (CRBs) show promise for large-scale energy storage. This review highlights the progress and challenges in developing high-performance cathode materials and provides insights for future advancements of CRBs.

TI MOF-on-MOF Strategy to Construct a Nitrogen-Doped Carbon-Incorporated
   CoP@Fe-CoP Core-Shelled Heterostructure for High-Performance Overall
   Water Splitting
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The design and preparation of efficient and low-cost catalysts for water electrolysis are crucial and highly desirable to produce eco-friendly and sustainable hydrogen fuel. Herein, we prepared nitrogen-doped carbon-incorporated CoP@Fe-CoP core-shelled nanorod arrays grown on Ni foam (CoP@Fe-CoP/ NC/NF) through phosphorization of ZIF-67@Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (ZIF-67@CoFe-PBA). The hierarchical nanorod arrays combined with the core-shelled structure offer favorable mass/electron transport capacity and maximize the active sites, thus enhancing the electrochemically active surface area. The synergistic effect of the bimetallic components and the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix endow the composite with an optimized electronic structure. Benefiting from the above superiorities of morphological and chemical compositions, this self-supported CoP@Fe-CoP/NC/NF heterostructure can drive alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with overpotentials of 97 and 270 mV to yield 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer constructed by this heterostructure shows a low cell voltage of 1.58 V to yield 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the precious-metal-based electrocatalyst apparatus (IrO2 vertical bar vertical bar Pt/C). This study offers a feasible and facile approach to develop efficient electrocatalysts for water electrolysis, which applies to other electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications.

TI An Ultrafast and Ultra-Low-Temperature Hydrogen Gas-Proton Battery
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Aqueous proton batteries are regarded as one of the most promising energy technologies for next-generation grid storage due to the distinctive merits of H+ charge carriers with small ionic radius and light weight. Various materials have been explored for aqueous proton batteries; however, their full batteries show undesirable electrochemical performance with limited rate capability and cycling stability. Here we introduce a novel aqueous proton full battery that shows remarkable rate capability, cycling stability, and ultralow temperature performance, which is driven by a hydrogen gas anode and a Prussian blue analogue cathode in a concentrated phosphoric acid electrolyte. Its operation involves hydrogen evolution/oxidation redox reactions on the anode and H+ insertion/extraction reactions on the cathode, in parallel with the ideal transfer of only H+ between these two electrodes. The fabricated aqueous hydrogen gas-proton battery exhibits an unprecedented charge/discharge capability of up to 960 C with a superior power density of 36.5 kW kg(-1), along with an ultralong cycle life of over 0.35 million cycles. Furthermore, this hydrogen gas-proton battery is able to work well at an ultralow temperature of -80 degrees C with 54% of its room-temperature capacity and under -60 degrees C with a stable cycle life of 1150 cycles. This work provides new opportunities to construct aqueous proton batteries with high performance in extreme conditions for large-scale energy storage.

TI Phenolic resin reinforcement: A new strategy for hollow NiCo@C
   microboxes against electromagnetic pollution
SO CARBON
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) transformation is evolving into an attractive strategy for the synthesis of functional carbon-based materials in different fields. However, this method is usually inapplicable to hierarchical carbon-based composites, because high-temperature pyrolysis easily accounts for microstructure collapse. Herein, with NiCo Prussian blue analog (PBA) microcubes as the precursor, we successfully harvest hollow NiCo@C microboxes through alkaline etching and phenolic resin (PR) reinforcement. PR modification not only stabilizes the microstructure during high-temperature pyrolysis, but also realizes the regulation of chemical composition simultaneously. The stability of microstructure essentially benefits from the fact that PR-derived carbon layer suppresses the agglomeration of NiCo nanoparticles effectively. Electromagnetic (EM) analysis suggests that hollow microstructure is very helpful to enhance dielectric loss, stimulate multiple reflection and scattering of EM waves, and realize good impedance matching. When the thickness of PR layer is optimized, the resultant hollow NiCo@C microboxes will possess excellent microwave absorption property, whose minimum reflection loss value can be as strong as -68.4 dB at 13.4 GHz and qualified bandwidth can cover 14.1 GHz (3.9-18.0 GHz) by integrating the absorber thickness from 1.00 to 5.00 mm. Such a performance promises hollow NiCo@C microboxes a bright prospect as potential candidates against EM pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI In situ construction of surface defects of carbon-doped ternary
   cobalt-nickel-iron phosphide nanocubes for efficient overall water
   splitting
SO SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS
AB The ternary cobalt-nickel-iron phosphide nanocubes (P-Co0.9Ni0.9Fe1.2 NCs) with high intrinsic activity, conductivity, defect concentration and optimized ratio have been realized through a facile phosphorization treatment using ternary cobalt-nickel-iron nanocubes of Prussian blue analogs (PBA) as a precursor. The scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results show that the P-Co0.9Ni0.9Fe1.2 NCs maintain a cubic structure with a rough surface, implying the rich surface defects as exposed active sites. The thermal phosphorization of the ternary PBA precursor not only provids carbon doping but also leads to the in situ construction of surface defects on the NCs. The carbon doping from the PBA precursor lowers the charge transfer resistance and optimizes the electronic transformation. The synergistic effect among the ternary metal ions and rich defects contributes to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The P-Co0.9Ni0.9Fe1.2 NCs achieve low overpotentials of -200.7 and 273.1 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. The potential of overall water splitting reaches 1.52 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The long-term stability of the electrocatalysts was also evaluated. This work provides a facile method to design efficient transition-metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

TI Trifunctional Electrocatalysis on Dual-Doped Graphene
   Nanorings-Integrated Boxes for Efficient Water Splitting and Zn-Air
   Batteries
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Despite the exciting achievements made in synthesis of monofunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it is challenging to develop trifunctional electrocatalysts for both ORR/OER/HER. Herein, N, O-codoped graphene nanorings-integrated boxes (denoted NOGB) are crafted via high-temperature pyrolysis and following acid etching of hybrid precursors containing polymers and Prussian blue analogue cubes. The electrochemical results signified that the resulting NOGB-800 (800 refers to pyrolysis temperature) is highly active for trifunctional electrocatalysis of ORR/OER/HER. This can be reasonably attributed to the advanced nanostructures (i.e., the hierarchically porous nanostructures on the hollow nanorings) and unique chemical compositions (i.e., N, O-codoped graphene). More attractively, the rechargeable Zn-air battery based on NOGB-800 displays maximum power density of 111.9 mW cm(-2) with small charge-discharge potential of 0.72 V and excellent stability of 30 h, comparable with the Pt/C+Ir/C counterpart. The NOGB-800 could also be utilized as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting to yield current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.65 V, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Therefore, the NOGB-800 is a promising candidate instead of precious metal-based electrocatalysts for the efficient Zn-air battery and water splitting.

TI Operando-reconstructed polyatomic ion layers boost the activity and
   stability of industrial current-density water splitting
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Metal-organic frameworks have garnered attention as highly efficient pre-electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Current structure-activity relationships primarily rely on the assumption that the complete dissolution of organic ligands occurs during electrocatalysis. Herein, modeling based on NiFe Prussian blue analogs (NiFe-PBAs) show that cyanide ligands leach from the matrix and subsequently oxidize to corresponding inorganic ions (ammonium and carbonate) that re-adsorb onto the surface of NiFe OOH during the OER process. Interestingly, the surface-adsorbed inorganic ions induce the OER reaction of NiFe OOH to switch from the adsorbate evolution to the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism, thus contributing to the high activity. In addition, this reconstructed inorganic ion layer acting as a versatile protective layer can prevent the dissolution of metal sites to maintain contact between catalytic sites and reactive ions, thus breaking the activity-stability trade-off. Consequently, our constructed NiFe-PBAs exhibit excellent durability for 1250 h with an ultralow overpotential of 253 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). The scale-up NiFe-PBAs operated with a low energy consumption of similar to 4.18 kWh m(-3) H-2 in industrial water electrolysis equipment. The economic analysis of the entire life cycle demonstrates that this green hydrogen production is priced at US$2.59 kg(H2)(-1), meeting global targets (<US$2.5 kg(H2)(-1)).

TI Uncoordinated chemistry enables highly conductive and stable
   electrolyte/filler interfaces for solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Composite-polymer-electrolytes (CPEs) embedded with advanced filler materials offer great promise for fast and preferential Li+ conduction. The filler surface chemis-try determines the interaction with electrolyte molecules and thus critically regulates the Li+ behaviors at the interfaces. Herein, we probe into the role of electrolyte/filler interfaces (EFI) in CPEs and promote Li+ conduction by introducing an unsaturated coordination Prussian blue analog (UCPBA) filler. Combining scanning transmis-sion X-ray microscope stack imaging studies and first-principle calculations, fast Li+ conduction is revealed only achievable at a chemically stable EFI, which can be established by the unsaturated Co-O coordination in UCPBA to circumvent the side reactions. Moreover, the as-exposed Lewis-acid metal centers in UCPBA efficiently attract the Lewis-base anions of Li salts, which facilitates the Li+ disassociation and enhances its transference number (tLi+). Attributed to these superiorities, the obtained CPEs realize high room-temperature ionic conductivity up to 0.36 mS cm-1 and tLi+ of 0.6, enabling an excellent cyclability of lithium metal electrodes over 4,000 h as well as remarkable capacity retention of 97.6% over 180 cycles at 0.5 C for solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries. This work highlights the crucial role of EFI chemistry in developing highly conductive CPEs and high-performance solid-state batteries.

TI Facile fabrication of a 3D network composed of N-doped carbon-coated
   core-shell metal oxides/ phosphides for highly efficient water splitting
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Development of robust, bifunctional, and non-precious catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) is a prerequisite to realizing the overall splitting of water. This, however, remains a great challenge. In this context, we fabricated a novel three-dimensional (3D) network comprising N-doped carbon-coated core-shell NiFeOx@ NiFe-P (denoted as NC-NiFeOx@ NiFe-P) by two-pot high-temperature phosphorization and surface oxidation of a NiFe-Prussian blue analogue/ polyvinylpyrrolidone (denoted as NiFe-PBAs/PVP) hybrid precursor. The as-synthesized NCNiFeOx@ NiFe-P catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance for both OER and HER, offering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (a metric related to solar fuel) at small overpotentials of 285 mV for the OER and 237 mV for the HER in 1 M KOH, respectively. As expected, a NC-NiFeOx@ NiFe-P based alkaline electrolyzer with durability of 20 h was manufactured to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.59 V, outperforming most non-precious metal-based electrolyzers. The exceptional performance could be attributed to the unique 3D network composed of core-shell NiFeOx@ NiFe-P and highly conductive N-doped carbon (NC), which provided a large amount of highly active sites for both OER and HER and favored fast electron transport during electrocatalytic processes.

TI Jellyfish-mimetic solar evaporator with polyelectrolyte skeleton for
   sustainable desalination under higher salinity
SO DESALINATION
AB Photothermal membranes have seen significant advancements in the field of solar seawater desalination. However, their practical application is hindered by solid-salt crystallization, which results in reduced evaporation rates. Herein, an "all-in-one" anionic jellyfish-mimetic solar evaporator is reported with sustainable condensate yields and electrostatic repulsion to prevent solid-salt crystallization. The innovative structure is composed of the jellyfish-mimetic photothermal head (in-situ grown nanospheres of Prussian blue analogue and molybdenum disulfide (PBA@MoS2)) while polyelectrolyte legs (water channels) enriched with SO3- groups by polystyrene sodium sulfonate (PSS). The negatively charged evaporator was characterized by a high concentration of SO3-, which induces the Donnan effect by confining Na+ to the microchannels. This process reduces the diffusion of salt ions into the water supply layer, thereby addressing the issue of salt deposition at its fundamental level. As a result, a high evaporation rate of 1.89 kg m- 2 h- 1 was achieved in high-concentration brine (20 wt% NaCl) under one sun irradiation. More importantly, the evaporator achieves high condensate yields (15.7 g/10 h) under natural sunlight and demonstrates excellent reproducibility in evaporation rates over 20 performance cycles on different days, even with a salinity of 20 wt%. The efficient evaporation efficiency and high salt tolerance present significant practical potential for solar-driven seawater desalination.

TI Emerging medium- and high-entropy materials as catalysts for
   lithium-sulfur batteries
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have attracted significant attention as a promising next-generation energy storage system due to their high theoretical energy density, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical implementation of LSBs faces several fundamental challenges, including the rapid capacity decay and poor cycling stability resulting from the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) during cycling, as well as security issues arising from the flammability of ether-based liquid electrolytes. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in overcoming those drawbacks through the use of catalysts which play a crucial role by promoting the redox reactions and suppressing the shuttle effect. Among the main trends, the concept of medium and high entropy materials (MEMs and HEMs) has emerged as a novel approach for designing advanced functional catalysts, making them suitable multimetallic-based candidates for LSBs. This review focuses on the development and utilization of MEMs and HEMs (alloys, metal oxides, Prussian blue analogues, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, and MXenes) as both sulfur hosts and catalysts for LSBs. The roles of various elements and their synergistic effects on the electrochemical performance are discussed, along with the strategies to optimize the catalyst design for enhanced sulfur utilization and cycling stability. Furthermore, the challenges, future perspectives, and directions in designing MEMs and HEMs-based catalysts for developing high-performance and reliable LSBs are addressed, paving the way for future energy storage applications.

TI Mosaic-Structured Cobalt Nickel Thiophosphate Nanosheets Incorporated
   N-doped Carbon for Efficient and Stable Electrocatalytic Water Splitting
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Engineering the nanostructures and compositions of 2D layered metal thiophosphates (MTPs) is significant for extending their applications. Here, a scalable and flexible strategy is presented to prepare single crystalline CoNiPS3 incorporated with N-doped carbon (CoNiPS3/C) nanosheets (approximate to 16 nm thickness), which can be further processed into the mosaic-structured CoNiPS3/C nanosheets (approximate to 6 nm thickness) composed of randomly distributed crystalline nanodomains (approximate to 15 nm diameter) and disordered boundaries (denoted as mosaic CoNiPS3/C nanosheets), and further into separated CoNiPS3/C nanodots (approximate to 4 nm diameter). The initial CoNiPS3/C nanosheeets are prepared by using Co-Ni Prussian-blue analogue nanoplates as templating precursors. As compared to the initial CoNiPS3/C nanosheets and nanodots, the mosaic CoNiPS3/C nanosheets exhibit plenty of active edge sites, retained crystallinity, and good structural stability. Synergistically, density functional theory calculations reveal that the bimetallic composition results in higher intrinsic activity, better conductivity, and lower kinetic energy barriers for bifunctional oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions. More importantly, a water-splitting electrolyzer constructed using the mosaic CoNiPS3/C nanosheets as both cathode and anode achieves 30 mA cm(-2) at 1.62 V, which is better than the initial CoNiPS3/C nanosheets (1.69 V) and is comparable to the discreted nanodots (1.58 V). Besides, the mosaic CoNiPS3/C nanosheets show much better electrocatalytic stability than nanodots.

TI Hierarchical CoFe@N-Doped Carbon Decorated Wood Carbon as Bifunctional
   Cathode in Wearable Zn-Air Battery
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS
AB Rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZAB) have drawn extensive attention due to their eco-friendliness and safety. However, the lack of high-performance and low-cost oxygen redox reactions (OER and ORR) catalysts has become one of the main stumbling blocks in their development. Herein, we successfully fabricate a CoFe nanobubble encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanocage on wood carbon support (CoFe@NC/WC) via pyrolysis of a novel Prussian blue analog (PBA)/spruce precursor. The hierarchical CoFe@NC/WC catalyst exhibits an excellent potential difference of 0.74 V between the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and half-wave potential of ORR in 0.1 M KOH, comparable to recently reported preeminent electrocatalysts. Further, CoFe@NC/WC shows outstanding electrochemical performance in liquid ZAB, with a peak power density of 138.9 mW cm(-2) and a specific capacity of 763.5 mAh g(-1). More importantly, a bacterial cellulose nanofiber reinforced polyacrylic acid (BC-PAA) hydrogel electrolyte shows ultrahigh tensile-breaking stress of 1.58 MPa. In conjunction with the as-prepared CoFe@NC/WC catalyst, BC-PAA-based wearable ZAB displays impressive rechargeability and foldability, and can power portable electronics, such as electronic timer and mobile phone, in bent states. This work provides a new approach toward high-activity and low-cost catalysts for ZAB.

TI Interface-Driven Pseudocapacitance Endowing Sandwiched
   CoSe2/N-Doped Carbon/TiO2 Microcubes with
   Ultra-Stable Sodium Storage and Long-Term Cycling Stability
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) has drawn great concern as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its considerable theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, the poor cycling stability and rate performance still impede its practical implantation. Here, CoSe2/nitrogen-doped carbon-skeleton hybrid microcubes with a TiO2 layer (denoted as TNC-CoSe2) are favorably prepared via a facile template-engaged strategy, in which a TiO2-coated Prussian blue analogue of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) is used as a new precursor accompanied with a selenization procedure. Such structures can concurrently boost ion and electron diffusion kinetics and inhibit the structural degradation during cycling through the close contact between the TiO2 layer and NC-CoSe2. Besides, this hybrid structure promotes the superior Na-ion intercalation pseudocapacitance due to the well- designed interfaces. The as-prepared TNC-CoSe2 microcubes exhibit a superior cycling capability (511 mA h at 0.2 A g(-1) after 200 cycles) and long cycling life (456 mA h at 6.4 A g(-1) for 6000 cycles with a retention of 92.7%). Coupled with a sodium vanadium fluorophosphate (Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3)@C cathode, this assembled full cell displays a specific capacity of 281 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) for 100 cycles. This work can be potentially used to improve other metal selenide-based anodes for rechargeable batteries.

TI Molecular Engineering to Construct MoS2 with Expanded
   Interlayer Spacing and Enriched 1T Phase for "Rocking-Chair" Aqueous
   Calcium-Ion Pouch Cells
SO ACS NANO
AB The moderate working voltage and high capacity of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) make them promising anode materials for aqueous calcium-ion batteries (ACIBs). However, the large radius and two charges of Ca2+ cause TMDs to exhibit poor performance in ACIBs. Therefore, effective regulation strategies are crucial for enabling the application of TMDs in ACIBs. Herein, MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing and an enriched 1T phase (ES-1T-MoS2) is constructed by molecular engineering and reported as an anode material for ACIBs. Molecular engineering increases the capacity of MoS2 from 29.4 to 91.2 mAh g(-1) and improves its rate performance from 20 to 76.1 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 A g(-1). ES-1T-MoS2 also shows a -20 to 50 degrees C wide temperature working capability. Furthermore, the capacity improvement reasons and the calcium storage mechanism of ES-1T-MoS2 are revealed through density functional theory calculations and in situ/ex situ characterizations. Finally, a "rocking-chair" aqueous calcium-ion pouch cell with a Prussian blue analogue cathode and ES-1T-MoS2 anode is assembled. The pouch cell exhibits a life of 150 cycles with over 90.8% capacity retention at 0 and 25 degrees C. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering is an effective strategy to improve the calcium storage performance of TMDs and promotes the advancement of ACIBs.

TI Interfacial Bonding of Metal-Sulfides with Double Carbon for Improving
   Reversibility of Advanced Alkali-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Engineering interfacial properties of metal-sulfides toward excellent electrochemical capability is imperative for advanced energy-storage materials. However, they still suffer from an unclear mechanism of capacity fading, along with ineffective physical-chemical evolution. Herein, a highly-effective Sb2S3 with double carbon is designed with interfacial Sb-C bonds and double carbon, which boosts promoting of ion transferring and alleviates the separation of both active phases (Sb, S). Through "voltage-cutting" manners, the key elements of capacity improvement about phase transitions are further determined. As expected, even at 5.0 A g(-1), the lithium-storage capacity remains about 674 mAh g(-1). Utilized as sodium ion battery (SIB) anode, the rate capacity still reaches up to 366 mAh g(-1) at 3.0 A g(-1), much larger than that of Sb2S3. Obtaining the full cell of Ni-Fe Prussian blue analog versus M-Sb2S3@DC, the reversible capacity is 330 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1). Supported by kinetic analysis, the excellent rate properties are determined by the surface-controlling behaviors, mainly resulting from the decreased capacitive resistance and improved ion moving. Furthermore, the reassembling evolution of active phases is revealed in detail by ex situ techniques. This work is expected to offer significant insights into interfacial evolutions toward advanced energy-storage systems.

TI Engineered contrast agents in a single structure for
   T1-T2 dual magnetic resonance
   imaging
SO NANOSCALE
AB The development of contrast agents (CAs) for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with T-1-T-2 dual-mode relaxivity requires the accurate assembly of T-1 and T-2 magnetic centers in a single structure. In this context, we have synthesized a novel hybrid material by monitoring the formation of Prussian Blue analogue Gd(H2O)(4)[Fe(CN)(6)] nanoparticles with tailored shape (from nanocrosses to nanorods) and size, and further protection with a thin and homogeneous silica coating through hydrolysis and polymerization of silicate at neutral pH. The resulting Gd(H2O)(4)[Fe(CN)(6)]@SiO2 magnetic nanoparticles are very stable in biological fluids. Interestingly, this combination of Gd and Fe magnetic centers closely packed in the crystalline network promotes a magnetic synergistic effect, which results in significant improvement of longitudinal relaxivity with regards to soluble Gd3+ chelates, whilst keeping the high transversal relaxivity inherent to the iron component. As a consequence, this material shows excellent activity as MRI CA, improving positive and negative contrasts in T-1- and T-2-weighted MR images, both in in vitro (e.g., phantom) and in vivo (e.g., Sprague-Dawley rats) models. In addition, this hybrid shows a high biosafety profile and has strong ability to incorporate organic molecules on the surface with variable functionality, displaying great potential for further clinical application.

TI K4[Fe(CN)6] immobilized anion sensitive protonated
   amine functionalized polysilsesquioxane films for ultra-low
   electrochemical detection of dsDNA
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Charge transport in polymeric films bound by redox reagents is a topic of current interest. The dynamics of electroinactive ions across the interface is studied by immobilizing ferrocyanide anion in a polysilsesquioxanes (PSQs) modified electrode. Redox reagents can stay in the polymeric film by either physical forces or electrostatic binding. The present work describes the immobilization of ferro/ferricyanide redox couples in PSQ films possessing protonated amine functional groups by electrostatic interactions. Charge transport in [Fe(CN)(6)](4-)-PSQs film was found to be anion dependent, and its formal potential value varied with the relative hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature of the anion used in the supporting electrolyte, unlike the observed dependence on solution cation for electrodes modified with metal hexacyanoferrates (Prussian Blue analogues). The [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) bound PSQs films were extensively characterized by varying different supporting electrolytes anions using cyclic voltammetry. The redox peak currents were linearly proportional to the square root of the scan rate, implying that the transport of charge carriers is accompanied with redox ion diffusion and electron hopping in a confined space. dsDNA molecules were found to interact with this polymer matrix through anionic phosphate groups. Both voltammetry and A.C. impedance spectroscopy studies revealed that these interactions could be exploited for the determination of ultra-low level (0.5 attomolar) of dsDNA present in aqueous solution.

TI Unique hollow Ni-Fe@MoS2 nanocubes with boosted
   electrocatalytic activity for N2 reduction to NH3
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Nanostructure tailoring is considered as an efficient strategy to design high-performance electrocatalysts for improving electrocatalytic properties by exposing more active sites and promoting rapid electron transfer. Unfortunately, nanomaterials with a well-constructed morphology for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions are insufficient, and the yield rate and faradaic efficiency are still not high. Herein, NiFe-MoS2 nanocubes (NiFe@MoS2 NCs) are successfully synthesized derived from the corresponding Prussian blue analog self-templating strategy. Owing to its four-pointed star face-dependent hollow structure and trimetallic synergistic interactions, it largely exposes abundant active sites, making it present superb electrocatalytic performance for N-2 conversion to NH3. In a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, these as-prepared Ni-Fe@MoS2 NCs exhibit a significant NH3 yield of 128.17 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) and a satisfactory faradaic efficiency of 11.34% at -0.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) operation at 40 degrees C. The stability of the catalyst was determined by performing 15 hour continuous N-2 reduction with a constant current density. The possible NRR catalytic paths, mechanism and electron transfer paths are elucidated in detail by in situ electrochemical-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. This work offers new inspirations to the development of various cost-effective electrocatalysts for N-2 fixation.

TI Unique Co3O4/ nitrogen- doped carbon nanospheres derived from metal-
   organic framework: insight into their superior lithium storage
   capabilities and electrochemical features in high- voltage batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The development of versatile strategies to create new structured materials via heteroatom doping has become a fascinating research topic owing to their fantastic properties, while the popular metal-organic framework opens promising avenues for the design of diverse architectures. Herein, an intriguing type of spherical N-doped porous carbon (i.e., N-C) particles containing numerous Co3O4 nanocrystals (i.e., Co3O4/N-C) is introduced, in which the Zn-Co based Prussian blue analogue acts as a sacrificial template and carbon source, while the volatilization of zinc and oxidation of Co produce rich pores and form highly active Co3O4 nanocrystals. The resultant Co3O4/N-C particles have an extremely high lithium storage capacity of 1255 mA h g(-1) and excellent rate capability even at a current of 2000 mA g(-1). Their long cycle life of over 500 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1) with a high capacity of 798 mA h g(-1) further demonstrates their prominent properties. Our kinetic analysis reveals that the high performances of Co3O4/N-C beyond the theoretical values mainly stem from the active Co3O4 nanocrystals, fast diffusion of lithium ions within its structure and its pseudocapacitive behaviors. Furthermore, the Co3O4/N-C particles also demonstrate impressive stability and rate capabilities in a lithium-ion battery versus a cathode of lithium layered oxide even at high voltage conditions.

TI Progressive hollow engineering induced raspberry-like magnetoelectric
   microspheres via synergistic etching-assembly strategy toward boosted
   microwave attenuation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Optimizing the electromagnetic (EM) properties of composites through elaborate tailoring of their microstructures has become an attractive research branch, but determining the correlations between morphology, composition, and performance remains challenging. Herein, a novel progressive hollow engineering strategy is proposed for the construction of hollow CuFe Prussian blue analog (CuFePBA, CF) precursors with asymptotic variations of cavities and PBA units based on a synergistic etching-assembly approach, subsequently combined with a polydopamine (PDA) coating and carbothermal process to acquire raspberry-like hollow Cu/Fe/Fe3C@NC(CFC) composites. The proposed approach addresses the drawbacks caused by organic ligand depletion or corrosive agent usage. We then present a systematic investigation of the mechanism by which the progressive hollow engineering-induced concurrent evolution of hollow cavities, phases, defects, and inhomogeneous interfaces contributes to the improvement of the dielectric properties of the CFC samples. An optimal reflection loss (RLmin) of- 65.17 dB at 3.29 mm was realized for the CFC-2 sample and the CFC-3 sample achieved an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 4.4 GHz at an ultra-thin thickness of 1.29 mm. This work reveals the synergistic effects of compositional, interfacial, and defect variations on the EM wave attenuation properties of the composites, and will provide new design inspiration for novel absorbers with modulatable hollow architectures.

TI Bifunctional Alloy/Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Layer for Enhanced
   Potassium Metal Batteries Via Prepassivation
SO ACS NANO
AB Potassium (K) metal batteries have attracted great attention owing to their low price, widespread distribution, and comparable energy density. However, the arbitrary dendrite growth and side reactions of K metal are attributed to high environmental sensitivity, which is the Achilles' heel of its commercial development. Interface engineering between the current collector and K metal can tailor the surface properties for K-ion flux accommodation, dendrite growth inhibition, parasitic reaction suppression, etc. We have designed bifunctional layers via prepassivation, which can be recognized as an O/F-rich Sn-K alloy and a preformed solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. This Sn-K alloy with high substrate-related binding energy and Fermi level demonstrates strong potassiophilicity to homogeneously guide K metal deposition. Simultaneously, the preformed SEI layer can effectually eliminate side reactions initially, which is beneficial for the spatially and temporally KF-rich SEI layer on K metal. K metal deposition and protection can be implemented by the bifunctional layers, delivering great performance with a low nucleation overpotential of 0.066 V, a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.1%, and durable stability of more than 900 h (1 mA cm-2, 1 mAh cm-2). Furthermore, the high-voltage platform, energy, and power densities of K metal batteries can be realized with a conventional Prussian blue analogue cathode. This work provides a paradigm to passivate fragile interfaces for alkali metal anodes.

TI Co/Mn ratio-regulated hexacyanoferrates as a long-life and high-rate
   cathode for aqueous Zn-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Among all kinds of cathodes for aqueous Zn-ion batteries, Mn-based hexacyanoferrates exhibit advantages of high-voltage and abundant resources. However, they suffer from inferior cycle-life and rate capability, which may be attributed to the structural instability and metal ion dissolution. In this work, a continuous element substitution (Mn replaced by Co) is employed to modify the electrochemical performance of Mn-based hexacyanoferrates. With the increasing ration of Co/Mn, the Mn, Co-based hexacyanoferrate (MnCoHCF) samples show unchanged crystalline phase with similar morphology and increasing Co dopant. Additionally, the initial specific capacity gradually decreases, but the electrochemical polarization is alleviated. Among the samples, MnCoHCF-4 (ratio of Co/Mn of 3:1) exhibits excellent cycling life (71.4% after 3000 cycles at 5 C) and rate performance (81.4 mA h g-1 at 10 C). In-situ techniques reveal the obvious metal ion dissolution with a low ratio of Co/Mn during the electrochemical process, resulting in poor structure stability and reaction kinetics of MnHCF electrode. However, When the ratio of Co/Mn is increased, the metal ion dissolution is effectively suppressed, and the MnCoHCF electrode shows improved structure stability and reaction kinetics. This work proposes an effective modification for hexacyanoferrates and other high-voltage Prussian blue analogues, which may promote the application of aqueous Zn-ion batteries.

TI Supercapacitor performance of MOF-derived double-shell hollow
   Ni-Fe-Mn-Se nanocubes
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB In this study, Ni-Fe-Mn-Se nano boxes with a double-layer hollow structure were synthesized by a static self-assembly and hydrothermal method. To generate a stable structure, NiFe Prussian blue analogue (NiFe-PBA) was used as the substrate material. Moreover, a layer of polydopamine (PDA) was applied onto the surface of the PBA as a "connecting link" to protect the PBA core from collapsing internally and anchor metal ions, enabling the external in-situ growth of NiMn-LDH. A comparison was made between the morphology and properties of nano boxes that were etched using varying concentrations of selenium acid. It was observed that the combination of multi-metallic elements with Se effectively modified the electronic structure of the material, improving its electrical conductivity. The synthesized electrode material, Ni-Fe-Mn-Se, exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1433 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor made of a Ni-Fe-Mn-Se cathode, Ni-Fe-Mn-Se// AC, demonstrated outstanding cycling stability (85 % capacitance retention after 8000 cycles) and a maximum energy density of 66.8 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 791 W kg-1. Thus, the electrode material synthesized in this study, Ni-Fe-Mn-Se, exhibits great promise for use in energy storage applications.

TI Metal-organic frameworks derived Ni5P4/NC@CoFeP/NC
   composites for highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB As an efficient non-precious metal catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), phosphides suffer from poor electrical conductivity, so it is still a challenge to reasonably design their structures to further improve their conductivity and OER performances. Here, we present a novel Ni5P4/N-doped carbon@CoFeP/N-doped carbon composite (Ni5P4/NC@CoFeP/NC) as electrocatalysts for OER. This elaborate structure consists of Ni5P4/NC derived from Ni-MOF and CoFeP/NC derived from CoFe-Prussian blue analog MOF (Co-Fe PBA). The cube-like CoFeP/NC are scattered and uniformly coated on the sheet of Ni5P4/NC flowers. Among them, NC can enhance the conductivity of phosphides, while CoFeP/NC can increase the electrochemical active area, which benefit the properties of Ni5P4/NC@CoFeP/NC. Notably, the Ni5P4/NC@CoFeP/NC catalyst possesses outstanding OER performances with a low overpotential of 260 and 303 mV at a current density of 10 and 100 mA center dot cmxe003;2, an ultra-low Tafel slope of 31.1 mV center dot dec1 and excellent stability in 1 M KOH. XPS analysis shows that proper chemical composition promotes the oxidation of transition metal species and the chemisorption of OH-, thus accelerating the OER kinetics. Therefore, this work provides a hopeful method for designing and preparing transition metal phosphide/carbon composite as OER electrocatalysts.

TI Facile preparation of a hollow core-shell nanocomposite for the
   ultrasensitive sensing of glucose
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB A core-shell Cu(OH)(2)@Au@Co(OH)(2) nanocomposite with hollow nano-flower morphology fabricated by a facile and non-surfactant template-engaged reaction was applied for highly sensitive detection of glucose. The prussian blue analogues (PBA) of core-shell nanocubes (CuFe@Au@CoFe) were synthesized as the template through the accurate control of the reaction rate. In this nanocubes, Au nanoparticles for accelerating electron transfer rate were reduced at the interface of CoFe (core) and CuFe (shell) to improve their conductivity. These nanocubes were then etched controllably to form three-dimensional hollow nanoflowers stacked by nanosheets. It provided abundant electrode-electrolyte channels and high surface areas for OH- and glucoses adsorption and the following reactions. Due to the sandwich structure and synergic effect of the nanomaterials, the as-prepared sensors exhibited an ultrahigh sensitivity of 3427 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) for glucose detection, as well as a wide linear range of 0.001-5.2 mM with a low detection limit of 0.5 mu M. In addition, the Cu(OH)(2)@Au@Co(OH)(2) nanocomposite showed long-term stability and good reproducibility for glucose detection in serum with comparable results as measured with commercial glucometer. We believe the nanocomposite provided a good candidate for glucometer in future clinical applications.

TI Fe-doped CoP core?shell structure with open cages as efficient
   electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Developing a facile approach based on transition metal-based Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) with core-shell nanostructure is a very promising choice for constructing cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a bimetallic core-shell structure with open cages of Fe-doped CoP (Fe-CoP cage) has been synthesized using CoFe-PBA cage-4 as precursor through a facile hydrothermal method and following phosphating process. Interestingly, there is an open hole in each face center of Fe-CoP cage, which suggests the more exposure of active sites for OER. Electrochemical measurements show that Fe-CoP cage can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential (300 mV), which is better than that of RuO2. The excellent performance can be attributed to Fe doping composition and unique open-cage core-shell structure. The synergistic effect derived from bimetallic active for OER has been discussed. And its great catalytic stability has been evaluated via 1000 cycles of CV and chronoamperometry measurement. This work provides a potential method to design multiple transitional metal-doping electrocatalysts with complex framework derived from PBAs for water splitting.

TI Near-zero thermal expansion coordinated with geometric flexibility and
   πMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISπ interaction in anisotropic
   [Zn8(SiO4)(m-BDC)6]n</su
   b>
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Zero thermal expansion (ZTE), a phenomenon in which a lattice structure remains constant upon heating, has attracted considerable interest owing to its potential applications. To date, in molecular materials, intrinsic single-phase ZTE or near-ZTE materials, such as isotropic Prussian blue analogues, are very rare. Herein, we report a near-ZTE compound, [Zn-8(SiO4)(m-BDC)(6)](n), which has an anisotropic framework structure with 1D helical chains along the crystallographic 4(2) axis. High-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and single crystal diffraction investigations reveal a positive thermal expansion (PTE) alpha(a) = +4.72 x 10(-6) K-1 and a negative thermal expansion (NTE) alpha(c) = -13.77 x 10(-6) K-1, with a near-ZTE volumetric behaviour alpha(V) = -4.35 x 10(-6) K-1 in the temperature range 100-475 K. Raman spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that spring-like geometric deformation results in the anisotropic thermal expansion behaviour. Further temperature-dependent structural analysis and reduced density gradient (RGD) calculations evidence that the pi MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi repulsion leads to the contraction of the building linkage. The synergistic effect of the geometric deformation and pi MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi interaction gives rise to the overall volumetric near-ZTE behaviour in [Zn-8(SiO4)(m-BDC)(6)](n).

TI FeCo Alloy Nanoparticles Confined in Carbon Layers as High-activity and
   Robust Cathode Catalyst for Zn-Air Battery
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Highly electrocatalytic activity and strong stability towards both oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been regarded as the critical factors in widespread application for the renewable energy technologies. It still remains a huge challenge for developing bifunctional catalysts with low cost, efficiently electrocatalytic activity and strong stability. In this paper, FeCo alloy nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon are synthesized through a simple thermal decomposition of Co-Fe Prussian Blue Analogue (Co-Fe PBA) in Ar atmosphere, during which the organic ligand of CN-in Co-Fe PBA provides both carbon and nitrogen sources for forming nitrogen doped carbon and FeCo alloy nanoparticles were formed, and thus producing a core-shell structure (FeCo@NC). According to a set of electrochemical tests, the obtained FeCo@NC can function as a Janus to drive OER and ORR with desirable activities and stabilities in alkaline media. Specifically, the FeCo@NC presents an onset-potential of 1.45V, a potential of 1.49V at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) as OER catalyst, and an Onset potential of 0.94V, a half-wave potential of 0.8V as ORR catalyst. The performance is comparable to those of precious metal based electrocatalysts, making it possible for potential application in the renewable energy devices, especially Zn-air battery.

TI Enhanced PMS activation by surface electronic reconstruction at
   Co3O4/ZnO heterointerface: Performance and
   mechanism
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation is regarded as a powerful method for eliminating refractory organic pollutants. A PMS catalyst with a rapid electron-transfer capability is vital for the generation of active species. Herein, an efficient Co3O4/ZnO catalyst with abundant Co3O4-ZnO heterointerface is synthesized by calcining Zn3[Co(CN6)]2 prussian blue analogues. Such a heterointerface can induce electron redistribution due to different work function between Co3O4 and ZnO, as confirmed by XPS characterization. Owing to the electron redistribution at Co3O4-ZnO heterointerface, a faster electron-transfer between catalyst and PMS is achieved, as proved by electrochemical studies. A series of controlled experiments, characterization and density functional theory calculation suggest that the fast electron transfer benefits from the enhanced electron-donating ability of Co(II) and the increased active sites (oxygen vacancy). Therefore, Co3O4/ZnO-3 shows superior catalytic activity toward PMS than Co3O4. The pseudo-first-order kinetic constant for phenol degradation by Co3O4/ZnO-3 (0.31 min-1) is 4 times higher than that of Co3O4. Besides, other refractory organic pollutants including bisphenol A, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofenand and rhodamine B could also be degraded effectively by Co3O4/ZnO-3 system. This study highlights how the interface design can optimize the electronic structure for enhanced catalytic activity and provides a new strategy to develop efficient PMS catalyst.

TI Fabrication of Co@SiO2@C/Ni submicrorattles as highly
   efficient catalysts for 4-nitrophenol reduction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB In this paper, an extended Stober method has been developed to fabricate a Ni2+-polydopamine (PDA) complex coated on Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)@SiO2 composites. After one-step carbonization involving the heat treatment of a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) cores and the PDA-Ni2+ shell under a nitrogen atmosphere, homogeneous Co@SiO2@C/Ni submicrorattles were synthesized. Notably, the silica interlayer played a vital role in the formation of such Co@SiO2@C/Ni submicrorattle structures. Without the protection of SiO2, Co-Ni@C composites were obtained instead and aggregated seriously due to sintering at high temperature. While with the silica layer as the spacer, the obtained Co@SiO2@C/Ni composites were not only well dispersed in the solution, but could also be adjusted in terms of the size and density of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface. Moreover, the size of core Co and surficial Ni NPs can be facilely modulated via changing the calcination temperature, which can effectively control the catalytic performance of the as-prepared nanocomposites. The as-prepared Co@SiO2@C/Ni submicrorattles were employed as the reaction catalyst for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), and exhibit both superior catalytic activity and cycling stability to Co@SiO2 and Co-Ni@C composites.

TI Boosting efficient removal of organic pollutants by sulfur modified
   hollow MnFe 2 O 4 nanocage: Synergist of three-dimensional structure and
   reactive species
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Bimetal-based peroxymonosulfate advanced oxidation processes (PMS-AOPs) present an enticing avenue for water treatment. The challenge of interference effects persists in addressing complex wastewater, including the occlusion of active sites by natural organic matters (NOMs) and the quenching of free radicals by competitive constituents. A sulfur-modified hollow MnFe 2 O 4 nanocage (S-MnFe 2 O 4 ) was introduced through a facile Prussian blue analog pyrolysis. The nanocage exhibited high interference resistance in terms of both active sites and reactive species. The hollow architecture, featuring a smaller pore diameter (2 - 50 nm) than NOMs (255.7 nm), effectively sequestered extraneous macromolecular interferences. Sulfur doping orchestrated a transformation in the PMS activation pathway via expediting the preferential adsorption of terminal oxygen in PMS and reducing the energy barrier to a non -radical pathway dominance ( 1 O 2 ), contributing to a highly discerning removal of target phenol. The performance for target degradation was sustained in the presence of multiple negative factors, including humic acid, competitive organic, and inorganic, due to the synergy between size exclusion and 1 O 2 . Even in natural waters (e.g. tap, lake, river, etc.) or continuous flow systems, the S-MnFe 2 O 4 /PMS combination showcased a remarkable removal effect. Co-regulation strategy unfolds a complete perspective to eliminate targets in the interference of other compounds.

TI Loading Pt Nanoparticles on Metal-Organic Frameworks for Improved Oxygen
   Evolution
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB An electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the crucial and limiting reaction in several renewable energy conversion systems, and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have triggered increasing research interests as potential catalysts toward OER Deeper understanding of the OER activity over MOFs is extremely desired for the exploitation of robust MOFs-based electrocatalysts. Herein, Pt nanoparticles are loaded on Prussian blue analogues (Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) and Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) nanocubes) to obtain improved catalytic activity. Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) and Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) are rationally selected because of their containing of the fascinating transition metals of Co and Ni species. Using the hybrid catalyst as the modular system, we demonstrate the inspiring effect of Pt on the OER activity of MOFs. Detailed exploration conclusively demonstrates that Pt supplies combined advantages for the enhanced OER activity of MOFs, such as improving the intrinsic catalytic activity by tuning the valence state of transition metals (Co, Ni), increasing active sites, and enhancing charge transfer. Moreover, thorough electrochemical studies are also performed to declare the key role of Pt in the excellent catalytic activity and stability. We believe that introduction of trace amounts of Pt or other noble metals will be an effective solution to achieve a significant improvement in the OER activity of MOFs.

TI Induced Diffusion Effect Realizes Heterogeneous Separation/Aggregation
   for In Situ Fabrication of Heterostructure with Enhanced Catalytic
   Activity
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Space charge transfer, which can be provided by heterogeneous structure, is the key to efficient electrocatalytic processes. However, difficulty in controlling the relative atomic diffusion rates due to different atomic radii and affinity makes heterogeneous nanostructures difficult to be accurately designed. Herein, an induced diffusion strategy based on affinity differences between elements is proposed to direct the separation/aggregation of different components in the precursor. The key to strategy in this study is the different affinity of Cu and Co to S/P in the precursor of CuCo Prussian blue analogue (PBA). By controlling the molar ratio of S and P during the phosphorization/vulcanization process, induced diffusion can be achieved and leads to directional separation/aggregation of Cu and Co species. As a result, a heterogeneous yolk-shell Cu2S@CoP2-C-N-S structure is successfully synthesized with a reticular CoP2-C-N-Cu-S as the shell and a Cu2S nanocrystal as the core. The space charge effect of the semiconductor heterojunction resulting from component separation/aggregation significantly promotes oxygen evolution reaction, resulting in an ultralow overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA<middle dot>cm(-2). This work not only provides a simple method for efficient separation of key components in gas-solid systems but also provides a method for fine-tuning the active site in an active-site-engineering approach.

AB Capacitive mixing (CapMix) is a promising technology to harvest salinity gradient energy (SGE) by generating electricity through the potential difference owing to electrolyte salinity change at the electrode/electrolyte interface. However, existing CapMix methods suffer from the high cost of ion-exchange membranes, additional energy investment, and limited energy density and cycle life. Herein, we propose a charge-free and membrane-free hybrid CapMix system consisting of ethylenediamine-modified activated carbon (EDA-YP80F) as a capacitive anode and a Prussian blue analog, iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF), as a battery-type cathode. The selective incorporation/absorption of Na+ ions and Cl- ions into FeHCF and EDA-YP80F achieves a membrane-free operation. The matching potentials of FeHCF and EDA-YP80F enable reversible discharges to a final voltage of zero, eliminating the energy investment by external power sources. Without an external power source and membranes, the FeHCF/EDA-YP80F full cell achieves an average power density of 110 mW m(-2) and energy density of 117 J m(-2) over 150 cycles under the 1-0.01 M NaCl salinity gradient. Under a high salinity gradient involving hypersaline solutions, i.e., 5-0.01 M NaCl, a remarkably high average power density of 218 mW m(-2) and energy density of 305 J m(-2) are demonstrated over 50 cycles.

TI Cetrimonium bromide assisted formation of antimony alloy nanorods for
   use as an anode in lithium-ion and sodium-ion full-cells
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Practical application of antimony alloy based electrodes in alkali-ion secondary batteries are viable due to their low-cost and widespread abundance. Employing unique nanostructuring strategies is vital for significantly improving their electrochemical performance while simultaneously addressing their inherent drawbacks. In this study, we report a simple microwave-hydrothermal approach for preparing antimony and tin-antimony alloy nanorods for the first time. Detailed X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal that the preferential adsorption of cetrimonium bromide molecules on the (1 1 0) planes of the precursor alloy nanoparticles results in the formation of self-assembled nanorods with an average aspect ratio of 6. When mixed with nitrogen-doped graphene flakes, these nanorods deliver reversible discharge capacities of 500 mAh g(-1) and 350 mAh g(-1) at the end of 200 cycles in Li+ and Na+ half-cell configurations, respectively. When coupled with a LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode, the resulting Li+ full-cell delivers a nominal working voltage of 4.3 V, a high energy density of 344 Wh kg(full-cell)(-1), and an 87.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles. Similarly, when coupled with a Prussian blue analog cathode, the resulting Na+ full-cell also delivers a nominal working voltage of 2.5 V, an energy density of 250 Wh kg(full-cell)(-1), and an 82.5% capacity retention after 100 cycles.

TI Towards polyvalent ion batteries: A zinc-ion battery based on NASICON
   structured Na3V2(PO4)3
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Zinc-ion batteries are considered as potential large-scale renewable energy storage devices due to low redox potential, low cost, large capacity, high electric conductivity, nontoxicity and easy processing of zinc metal. However, the development of cathode materials for zinc-ion batteries to date has been mainly limited to tunnel manganese oxides and Prussian blue analogues. Here we have firstly developed NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)(3) as cathode material for Zn-ion batteries. To compensate the low conductivity, graphene-like carbon wrapped Na3V2(PO4)(3) nanoparticles are fabricated. With Na3V2(PO4)(3)/C as cathode, Zn metal as both counter and reference electrodes, and 0.5 mol L-1 Zn(CH3COO)(2) solution as electrolyte, the aqueous Zn-ion battery delivers a reversible capacity of 97 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C and retains 74% capacity after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, the battery can be charged and discharged at high rate up to 10 C. The cyclic voltammogram analysis shows that the Zn-ion storage in Na3V2(PO4)(3) is a diffusion controlled kinetic process. A mechanism of Zn ion occupancy variation during cycling is proposed. Our results provide an example for understanding and designing the intercalation process of divalent metal ions in NASICON structured cathode for new type rechargeable divalent metal ion batteries.

TI Activated carbon supported Fe-Cu-NC as an efficient cathode catalyst for
   a microbial fuel cell
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising device for converting bioenergy into electrical energy, but its performance is mainly limited by the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Hence, exploring ORR catalysts with low cost and great performance is of great practical significance for improving the power generation efficiency of MFCs. In this study, we prepared an electrocatalyst of an Fe-Cu-N multi-doped carbon matrix through pyrolyzing Fe-Cu Prussian blue analogs (PBA) under the protection of nitrogen. Fe-Cu-NC with high activity bimetallic active sites efficiently optimized the electronic distribution of the Fe-Cu-N multi-doped carbon matrix and thereby improved the ORR activity. Electrochemical analysis indicated that the Fe-Cu-N multi-doped carbon structure exhibited excellent ORR catalytic activity and stability. Therefore, MFCs with an Fe-Cu-NC-50% catalyst offered an output power density up to 413.01 mW m(-2), which was 3.5 times higher than that of the control (116.16 mW m(-2)). Besides, using Fe-Cu-NC-50% as an ORR catalyst, a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal ratio of about 81.62 +/- 3.48% was obtained. This work indicates that the synthesized Fe-Cu-N multi-doped carbon structure will have a promising future in the practical application of MFCs.

TI Weakly hydrophobic microenvironment-assisted membrane-based confined
   catalysis for efficient organoarsenic contamination removal
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Enhancing the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in powder Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for addressing insufficient mass transfer and reactivity loss in humid environments remains a significant challenge. In response to this issue, we proposed a novel approach involving the creation of a weakly hydrophobic microenvironment-assisted confined strategy for the fabrication of a mixed dimensional GO-HT@ bimetallic Prussian blue analogues (PBA) confined catalytic membrane through low-temperature treatment (GO-HT). This innovative method has demonstrated improved mass transfer capabilities for the safe treatment of organoarsenic compounds. The optimized GO-HT@PBA confined membrane exhibited a marked improvement in the removal efficiency of p-arsanilic acid (p-ASA) compared to its unconfined counterpart, showing a substantial increase in the reaction kinetic constant by 6-7 orders of magnitude (0.46 ms-1) compared to unconfined GO-HT@PBA/ PMS system. Additionally, the GO-HT@PBA membrane exhibited superior pH tolerance, and resistance to inorganic ions, humic acid, and complex water matrices. Notably, the membrane achieved nearly complete degradation of p-ASA and immobilization of total arsenic over a continuous operation period of 107 h, highlighting its exceptional reactivity and stability. Overall, our research will inform the development of MOF-based composites, with the potential to enhance the reactivity of the catalytic component and mitigate its inherent limitations by leveraging the host's properties.

TI High-performance hybrid supercapacitors enabled by CoTe@CoFeTe
   double-shelled nanocubes
SO NANOSCALE
AB Metal tellurides, known for their superior electrical conductivity and excellent electrochemical properties, are promising candidates for supercapacitor applications. This study introduces a novel method involving a metal-organic framework hybrid to synthesize CoTe@CoFeTe double-shelled nanocubes. Initially, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF67) and CoFe Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanocubes are synthesized through an anion-exchange reaction with [Fe(CN)6]3- ions. Subsequent annealing treatment converts these structures into Co3O4@CoFe2O4 double-shelled nanocubes. These are then subjected to a tellurization process to form CoTe@CoFeTe, which exhibits outstanding supercapacitive performance. Notably, the CoTe@CoFeTe based-electrode demonstrates superior supercapacitive properties compared to their oxide counterparts, mainly due to the introduction of tellurium ions. These nanocubes show an impressive specific capacity of 1312 C g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and maintain 92.35% of their capacity after 10 000 charging cycles, highlighting their durability and the synergistic effect of the mixed metals and their hollow structure. Furthermore, when used as the positive electrode material in a hybrid supercapacitor with activated carbon (AC), the device achieves an energy density of 64.66 W h kg-1 and retains 88.25% of its capacity after 10 000 cycles. These results confirm the potential of the developed material for advanced supercapacitor applications.

TI Core-shell FeCo@carbon nanoparticles encapsulated in
   polydopamine-derived carbon nanocages for efficient microwave absorption
SO CARBON
AB Rational manipulation on chemical composition and microstructure is evolving as a powerful approach to reinforce the electromagnetic (EM) functions of magnetic carbon-based composites. With FeCo Prussian blue analogs (FeCo PBAs) as the nucleation sites, we conduct the polymerization of dopamine (DA) on their surface and then convert the precursor into desirable FeCo alloy/carbon composites. PDA coating is greatly helpful to suppress the microstructure collapse of FeCo PBAs during high-temperature pyrolysis, resulting in a unique hierarchical configuration of core-shell FeCo@C nanoparticles encapsulated in PDA-derived carbon nanocages. The formation of carbon nanocages not only adjusts the relative carbon content, but also affects EM properties of these composites. In particular, the dielectric loss can be significantly enhanced, which further accounts for an improvement in overall attenuation ability toward incident EM waves. When the weight ratio of DA to FeCo PBAs reaches 0.75, the obtained composite will exhibit excellent microwave absorption performance thanks to its decent attenuation ability and matched characteristic impedance. The strongest reflection loss intensity is located at -67.8 dB at 15.8 GHz, and the effective bandwidth covers 11.0-16.3 GHz with the thickness of 2.00 mm. The advantages in microstructure are also established by parallel comparison with a disordered counterpart. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Separation and detection of tropane alkaloids in Anisodus
   tanguticus by capillary electrophoresis-electrochemiluminescence
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB A Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)-based electrochemiluminescence method coupled with capillary electrophoresis has been developed for the separation and detection of two tropane alkaloids, anisodamine and anisodine, within 7 min with a platinum microelectrode modified with a europium(III)-doped Prussian blue analog film as the working electrode. Under optimized conditions, the ECL intensity was in proportion to the log values of anisodine and anisodamine concentrations in the range 5.0 x 10(-6)-1.0 x 10(-3) mol L-1 (r = 0.9992) for anisodine and 1.0 x 10(-6)-1.0 x 10(-3) mol L-1 (r = 0.9991) for anisodamine, with detection limits of 1.2 x 10(-7) mol L-1 for anisodine and 4.3 x 10(-8) mol L-1 for anisodamine. The proposed method has been applied to identify and detect the two alkaloids in the different parts (seeds, roots and leaves) of Anisodus tanguticus. The results showed that anisodine existed in all samples, including the seeds, roots and leaves of the plant, and its content was highest in the seeds and lowest in the leaves. However, anisodamine was not found in the samples mentioned above due to the low levels in the plant and maybe the interreaction between anisodamine and other chemicals in the plant. Finally, average recoveries of 98.0-107.0% were obtained.

TI End-capping of hydrogen bonds: A strategy for blocking the proton
   conduction pathway in aqueous electrolytes
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Sustainable battery development is becoming a key goal for storing renewable energy on a large scale. Toward this goal, great hopes are placed on the use of aqueous electrolytes. However, with high expectations, come increasing challenges, represented by the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the anode of aqueous batteries. Here, we propose a new strategy to mitigate HER in aqueous batteries by the regulation of mass transfer kinetics, namely blocking the pathway of proton conduction by the end-capping of H-bond using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The NMP structure possesses the H-bond acceptor but no H-bond donor sites, a feature that can effectively cut off H-bond propagation, and further block the pathway of proton transport in aqueous electrolytes. Hence, the modulated electrolyte confers a combination of enhanced cathodic and anodic stability, dendrite-free metal plating/stripping, and a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.2%. Further, the end-capping of the H-bond network in electrolytes results in substantially more stable full-cell batteries that pair the metal anode with Prussian blue analogue (PBA) and polyaniline (PANI) cathodes at both room and low temperature. The "end-capping" concept in polymers is broadened to aqueous solutions for the first time here, providing a potential direction to revolutionize aqueous batteries for efficient energy storage.

TI Facile synthesis of hierarchical porous Co3O4
   nanoboxes as efficient cathode catalysts for Li-O2 batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries with remarkably high theoretical energy densities have attracted extensive attention. However, to enable Li-O-2 batteries for practical applications, numerous challenges need to be overcome, e. g. high overpotential, low rate capability, and poor cycling stability. The key factor to tackle these issues is to develop highly-efficient cathode catalysts. Moreover, cathode catalysts with a porous structure and large surface area are favorable in Li-O-2 batteries. In this paper, hierarchical porous Co3O4 nanoboxes with well-defined interior voids, functional shells and a large surface area have been facilely synthesized via an ion exchange reaction between Prussian blue analogue nanocubic precursors and OH at a low temperature (60 degrees C). The obtained products possess hierarchical pore sizes and an extremely large surface area (272.5 m(2) g(-1)), which provide more catalytically active sites to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a Li-O-2 battery cathode, as well as facilitating the diffusion of oxygen and the electrolyte. The hierarchical porous Co3O4 nanobox cathode shows enhanced discharge capacity, reduced overpotential, improved rate performance and cycle stability, in comparison with the EC-300J carbon cathode. The superb performance of the hierarchical porous Co3O4 nanoboxes, together with the facile fabrication approach, presents an alternative method to develop advanced cathode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries.

TI Three-dimensional charge transfer pathway in close-packed nickel
   hexacyanoferrate-on-MXene nano-stacking for high-performance capacitive
   deionization
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), as a kind of metal-organic framework-like materials, has attracted great attention in capacitive deionization (CDI) field due to excellent redox activity, but its desalination performance, especially its desalination rate, is greatly limited due to its poor electrical conductivity. Hybridization of PBAs with MXene can potentially solve this problem, but still remains intrinsic limitation, such as poor vertical charge transfer between nano-sheets. Herein, we engineered a three-dimensional (3D) charge transfer pathway in nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF)/MXene through in situ close packing of NiHCF nanoparticles on MXene nano-stacking by electrostatic attraction. Compared to charge transfer mode in two-dimensional (2D) nano-sheets, 3D MXene nano-stacking can not only have excellent conductivity like MXene to provide horizonal charge transfer pathway alongside nano-sheets, but also possess unique vertical charge transfer pathway between nano-sheets. As a result, the NiHCF/MXene exhibits a superior desalination performance with a high desalination capacity of 30 mg g-1, ultrahigh desalination rate of 9.5 mg g-1 min-1 and good cycling stability over 30 cycles. This work demonstrates an effective way to address the poor CDI performance of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles by employing 3D MXene nano-stacking as charge transfer support, and is of significance to be applied for other nanoparticle materials.

TI High-Voltage Aqueous Na-Ion Battery Enabled by Inert-Cation-Assisted
   Water-in-Salt Electrolyte
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Water-in-salt (WiS) electrolytes provide a new pathway to widen the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes. However, their formulation strongly depends on the solubility of the chosen salts, imposing a stringent restriction on the number of possible WiS systems. This issue becomes more severe for aqueous Na-ion batteries (ANIBs) owing to the relatively lower solubility of sodium salts compared to its alkaline cousins (Li, K, and Cs). A new class of the inert-cation-assisted WiS (IC-WiS) electrolytes containing the tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) inert cation is reported. The Na IC-WiS electrolyte at a superhigh concentration of 31 mol kg(-1) exhibits a wide electrochemical window of 3.3 V, suppresses transition metal dissolution from the cathode, and ensures singular intercalation of Na into both cathode and anode electrodes during cycling, which is often problematic in mixed alkali cation systems such as K-Na and Li-Na. Owing to these unique advantages of the IC-WiS electrolyte, the NaTiOPO4 anode and Prussian blue analog Na1.88Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.97)center dot 1.35H(2)O cathode can be coupled to construct a full ANIB, delivering an average voltage of 1.74 V and a high energy density of 71 Wh kg(-1) with a capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles at 0.25C and of 76% over 800 cycles at 1C.

TI Phosphorus-bridged ternary metal alloy encapsulated in few-layered
   nitrogen-doped graphene for highly efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen
   evolution
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The strategy of combining non-noble metal core and carbon shell can produce a synergistic effect through interface engineering and simultaneously promote the activity and stability of materials. Heteroatomic doping can effectively regulate the band structure of graphene. Besides, the doping of phosphorus increases the distance between the metal alloy cores and is accompanied by the contraction of the D bandgap, the Fermi level near the density-of-states (DOS) is enhanced, which makes it have the characteristics of precious metals. Therefore, the design of heteroatomic-doped graphene-coated phosphorus-doped metal core-shell structure will effectively improve the electrocatalytic performance. Here, we use Prussian blue as the precursor to prepare the transition metal binary alloy and ternary alloy coated with multi-layer nitrogen-rich graphene shell by direct annealing in an inert atmosphere. Further, the core-shell nanostructure was converted to phosphorus-doped FeCoMo ternary alloy core through phosphating, in which phosphorus plays the role of bridging the ternary alloy and N-doped graphene shell, which is beneficial to improve the HER performance. The optimal material FeCoMo@NG-P exhibited excellent catalytic performance for HER in both 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 170 mV for the alkaline solution and 196 mV for the acid solution, and the corresponding Tafel slopes are 95.37 and 63.17 mV dec(-1), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that changing the ratio of the internal alloy can regulate the charge distribution on the surface of the outer graphene layer. In addition, in the case of phosphorus-bridged ternary metal alloy core and nitrogen-doped graphene shell, they synergistically increase the electron density and regulate the energy band structure on the surface of the graphene layer, which results in superior HER activity.

TI Heterogeneous interface engineering of CoPSe and FePSe3 on
   open frameworks for boosting highly efficient overall water splitting
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Enhancing intrinsic activity of nanostructured heterogeneous catalysts is an effective strategy for improving electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER), but it remains challenging. Here, phosphorus (P) and selenium (Se) atoms are incorporated into an open Co-Fe-based Prussian blue analogues to form a heterostructure consisting of CoPSe and FePSe3 via a one-step pyrolysis strategy. The CoPSe/ FePSe3 heterojunction greatly reduces the overpotential for HER (91 mV) or OER (172 mV), which is close to that of Pt/C or much better than that of RuO2, respectively. Co-doping of P and Se non-metallic atoms promotes the reaction kinetics and the exposure of active sites in the framework structure with a large specific surface area. The interactions between CoPSe and FePSe3 can eagerly promote the interfacial electron transfer to enhance HER/OER activities. The carbon skeleton can effectively avoid the fast corrosion/aggregation of the embedded CoPSe/FePSe3 heterojunctions, thereby enhancing the catalytic/structural stability for HER/OER. Importantly, for overall water splitting, the electrolyzer with CoPSe/FePSe3 catalyst only requires an overpotential of 0.35 V to achieve a long-term stability (36 h) at 10 mA cm(- 2), with Faradaic efficiencies near 100 %. This work sheds a new light on promotion of intrinsic activity of heterostructured catalysts for water splitting.

TI Separator Modified by Carbon-Encapsulated CoFe Alloy Nanoparticles
   Supported on Carbon Nanotubes for Advanced Lithium-Sulfur Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB The commercialization of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries still confronts great challenges due to the sluggish redox kinetics of sulfur and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides. Designing a highly active electrocatalyst is an effective strategy to address the problems caused by complex multistep reactions. Herein, a hybrid composite composed of nitrogen-doped carbon-wrapped bimetallic cobalt-iron alloy nanoparticles (NC@CoFe) is derived from a Prussian blue analogue and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which is used as a functional coating on a separator for Li-S batteries. The cross-linked CNTs provide a robust and conductive network for quick charge transfer and sufficient active-site exposure, and the NC@CoFe nanoparticles demonstrate a strong ability for anchoring and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides. The specific discharge capacity of the cell with the NC@CoFe/CNT-modified separator can reach 865.4 mA h/g at 3.18 mA/cm(2) (0.5 C) and is 576.3 mA h/g after 300 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98.2%. The cells with a 7.4 mg/cm(2) sulfur loading display a remarkable capacity retention of 77.8% after 100 cycles. The electrocatalyst with functionalized carbonaceous adsorption and alloy nanoparticle catalysis holds substantial promise for advancing the commercialization of durable Li-S batteries.

TI Effect of doping Ni on microstructures and properties of CoxNi1-xHCF
   based seawater battery
SO VACUUM
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been proven to be a kind of seawater battery cathode due to the accommodation of electrons upon the intercalation of Na+ in seawater. In the current work, Ni-doped cobalt hex-acyanoferrate (CoxNi1-xHCF) was fabricated by using co-precipitation method at room temperature. Results have shown that with increasing the molar ratio of Co: Ni, the specific capacity of the cathode initially increases and then decreases. The best battery properties were obtained when the molar ratio of Co: Ni was 1:2. The specific capacity was up to 76.5 mAh & sdot;g- 1 at 0.1 A g-1, the capacity retention was up to 63.5 % at a current density of 10 A g-1, and the capacity retention of 81 % was obtained after 100 cycles. The introduction of Ni2+ increases the specific surface area leading to the additional active sites for the redox reaction. At the same time, the specific capacity decreased due to the Ni doping. The enhanced electrochemical performance of CoxNi1-xHCF cathode for seawater battery was achieved by considering the synergistic effects of specific surface and elemental composition. Furthermore, seawater battery was successfully assembled by matching the Co0.86Ni0.14HCF cathode with Mg anode, which demonstrates the promising application of PBAs for seawater batteries.

TI MOF-on-MOF strategy improves active site dispersion and enhances
   pesticide wastewater purification in photo-Fenton-like system
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The use of a photo-Fenton-like system to achieve water purification has attracted widespread attention. However, the successful coupling between PMS activation and photocatalysis is one of the challenges of building a photo-Fenton-like system. In this work, a MOF-on-MOF strategy though Prussian blue analogs (PBA) grown by ion exchange using CoFe-ZIF and Fe(CN)(6)(3-) is considered to be an effective method to enhance the efficiency of photo-Fenton-like system. Furthermore, the clever modification of the sacrificial template (zeolitic imidazolate frameworks) is conducive to improve the catalytic performance of the final material. CoFe-ZIF/PBA possesses advantageous PMS decomposition efficiency (71 %) and favorable purification capacity (rate constant of 1.081 min(-1)), overtaking the majority of the non-homogeneous Fenton-like catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance of CoFe-ZIF/PBA is enhanced by the introduction of PBA nanoparticles, which increases the activation sites of PMS and improves the photogenerated electron transport in a photo-Fenton-like system. In conclusion, this study aims to enhance the efficiency of the Fenton-like system by utilizing the intrinsically active sites of the material to link continuously injected photogenerated electrons. The findings provide valuable insights for designing catalysts in heterogeneous photo-Fenton-like systems and expand the application of PBA nanoparticles in the field of water purification.

TI Whispers of Entropic Distortion Elevating Voltage and Electrochemical
   Depth in Potassium Hexacyanoferrate Cathodes
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) are regarded as one of the most promising cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to their broad operating voltage range, low potassium-ion diffusion barriers, and cost-effective, simple synthesis. However, the passivation of low-spin transition metal centers and inherently poor electronic conductivity severely limit PBAs' potential to achieve high energy density and long-term cycling stability. In this study, the first successful activation of low-spin transition metal reactivity in a non-aqueous PIB system through the incorporation of a high-entropy multimetallic coordination strategy is reported. This approach not only precisely regulates the voltage platform but also significantly enhances the material's energy density. The synthesized high-entropy K1.19Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Mn0.2[Fe(CN)6]0.79 square 0.21<middle dot>1.16H2O (HEPBA) cathode achieved a remarkable energy density of 407.67 W h kg-1 at an average working voltage of 3.89 V, with a capacity retention of 88.03% after 2000 cycles at 500 mA g-1. Density functional theory (DFT) and field emission analysis (FEA) calculations revealed that the high-entropy design not only improved the electronic conductivity during K+ intercalation but also significantly reduced ion diffusion barriers. Additionally, the material exhibited reduced volumetric expansion during potassium-ion insertion/extraction, greatly enhancing its long-term cycling stability.

TI Magnetic-dielectric synergy and interfacial engineering to design
   yolk-shell structured CoNi@void@C and CoNi@void@C@MoS2
   nanocomposites with tunable and strong wideband microwave absorption
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB In order to effectively utilize the magnetic-dielectric synergy and interfacial engineering, in this paper, yolk-shell structured magnetic multicomponent nanocomposites (MCNCs) including CoNi@void@C and CoNi@void@C@MoS2 were produced in large scale by in-situ pyrolysis of cubic CoNi Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) followed by the hydrothermal process, respectively. Because of their unique structures, excellent synergistic effect between dielectric and magnetic loss, the as-prepared CoNi@void@C and CoNi@void@C@MoS2 MCNCs displayed very outstanding electromagnetic wave absorption performances (EMWAPs) including strong absorption capabilities, broad absorption bandwidth and thin matching thicknesses. Furthermore, the as-prepared CoNi@void@C and CoNi@void@C@MoS2 MCNCs well maintained the cubic configuration of CoNi PBAs even after the thermal treatment and hydrothermal processes. The unique structure and formed carbon layers effectively prevented the corrosion of internal CoNi alloy during the formation of MoS2, and CoNi@void@C@MoS2 MCNCs with different MoS2 contents could be synthesized by controlling the hydrothermal temperature. The obtained results revealed that the EM parameters, dielectric and magnetic loss capabilities of CoNi@void@C@MoS2 MCNCs could be tuned by controlling hydrothermal temperature and filler loading, which made their outstanding EMWAPs could be achieved in different frequency regions. Taking account of simple process, low density and high chemical stability, our findings provided a new and effective pathway to develop the strong wideband microwave absorbers.

TI Self-Sacrifice Template Fabrication of Hierarchical Mesoporous
   Bi-Component-Active ZnO/ZnFe2O4 Sub-Microcubes as
   Superior Anode Towards High-Performance Lithium-Ion Battery
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB In the work, a facile yet efficient self-sacrifice strategy is smartly developed to scalably fabricate hierarchical mesoporous bi-component-active ZnO/ZnFe2O4 (ZZFO) sub-microcubes (SMCs) by calcination of single-resource Prussian blue analogue of Zn-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) cubes. The hybrid ZZFO SCMs are homogeneously constructed from well-dispersed nanocrstalline ZnO and ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) subunites at the nanoscale. After selectively etching of ZnO nanodomains from the hybrid, porously assembled ZFO SMCs with integrate architecture are obtained accordingly. When evaluated as anodes for LIBs, both hybrid ZZFO and ZFO samples exhibit appealing electrochemical performance. However, the as-synthesized ZZFO SMCs demonstrate even better electrochemical Li-storage performance, including even larger initial discharge capacity and reversible capacity, higher rate behavior and better cycling performance, particularly at high rates, compared with the single ZFO, which should be attributed to its unique microstructure characteristics and striking synergistic effect between the bi-component-active, well-dispersed ZnO and ZFO nanophases. Of great significance, light is shed upon the insights into the correlation between the electrochemical Li-storage property and the structure/component of the hybrid ZZFO SMCs, thus, it is strongly envisioned that the elegant design concept of the hybrid holds great promise for the efficient synthesis of advanced yet low-cost anodes for next-generation rechargeable Li-ion batteries.

TI Polypyrrole-Coated K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] Stabilizing Its
   Interfaces and Inhibiting Irreversible Phase Transition during the Zinc
   Storage Process in Aqueous Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been considered as promising cathodes for aqueous zinc-ion batteries because of their open framework for accommodating large ions, tunable valence state, and facile synthesis. Among PBAs, potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) is favored due to its high working voltage, high specific capacity, and low cost. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay and poor rate capability, which are mainly a result of poor intrinsic conductivity, irreversible phase transition, transition metal dissolution, and structural collapse during charge/discharge cycling. These issues extremely limit its practical application. In order to solve these problems, conductive polypyrrole (PPy) was used to coat KMHCF microcubes to form KMHCF@PPy composites to achieve superior rate capability and prolonged cycle life. With the PPy coating, the KMHCF@PPy composite delivers a discharge capacity of 107.6 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) , and even at 500 mA g(-1) after 500 cycles, 64.2 mA h g(-1) still remained. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the effects from PPy. On the one hand, PPy supplies an effective electronic transmission network for KMHCF to enhance the electronic conductivity. On the other hand, it plays the role of a protective layer to effectively inhibit the dissolution of Mn and the phase transition during the cycling.

TI Decoration of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanocubes onto reduced graphene
   oxide sheets as high-performance cathode material for rechargeable
   aqueous zinc-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBA) have attracted much attention in energy research due to their unique three-dimensional open framework structure, adjustable metal ions, and facile synthesis. However, the application of PBA as a cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) is restricted by its poor cycling performance and lower capacity. In this paper, we develop a new PBA-based hybrid cathode material for aqueous ZIBs by loading uniform nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) nanocubes onto reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets. In the NiHCF/RGO hybrid, NiHCF nanoparticles are well anchored on the RGO layers, forming a conductive network. The strong synergy between NiHCF and highly conductive RGO effectively increases the specific surface area, accelerates the electron and ion transport, and inhibits the structural collapse of the NiHCF/RGO electrode during the Zn2+ insertion/extraction process. Benefiting from the above advantages, the NiHCF/RGO hybrid exhibits a remarkable reversible capacity of 94.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 5 mA g(-1), excellent rate performance of 50.1 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), and enhanced cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80.3% after 1000 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). This work provides a simple and effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of PBA-based cathodes for aqueous ZIBs application. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Study on the Mechanism of the Influence of Doping on the Properties of
   Cathode Materials of Sodium Ion Batteries
SO PROGRESS IN CHEMISTRY
AB The abundance of sodium salt in the earth's crust is 1000 times higher than that of lithium. At the same time, low-cost aluminum foil can be used as the anode of sodium ion battery instead of copper foil, and the low-temperature characteristics are more excellent, which has a good application prospect in energy storage and standby energy storage scenarios. Therefore, sodium ion battery is considered one of the ideal choices for the next generation of large-scale energy storage technology. However, compared with lithium ion, the large ion radius and mass of sodium ion greatly limit its reversible deintercalation in electrode materials, resulting in relatively low working voltage and energy density of the battery. In the sodium ion battery materials system, the research of cathode materials needs great progress. In this paper, the existing typical cathode materials for sodium ion batteries are reviewed, including layered metal oxides, polyanions and Prussian blue compounds. The effect of doping on the performance of cathode materials for sodium ion batteries is analyzed. The cycling reversibility, reversible capacity and diffusion kinetics of sodium ions can be improved by element doping, which can change the properties of the crystal lattice to a certain extent, and enhance the stability, electronic conductivity and intercalation kinetics of sodium ions. In this paper, the achievements of doping application in the existing materials are summarized, and the future research direction and development prospect of cathode materials are put forward.

TI Design of Redox-Active Cs⊂{Fe4Ni4} Cyanide-Bridged Cage Complexes
   Bearing Monodentate Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Electronic
   Properties
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB In recent years, strong efforts have been devoted to the design and crystallization of molecular models of the cyanidobridged inorganic polymers known as "Prussian Blue Analogues" (PBA). In this work, we more specifically focus on soluble octametallic complexes that represent an elemental unit of the PBA cubic network. The self-assembly of tris-cyanido, the fac- [FeIII(Tp)(CN)3]- (Tp = hydro-tris(pyrazol-1-yl-borate) complex, and Ni(II) salts is shown to lead to {[Fe(Tp)(CN)3]4[Ni(S)3]4} procubes, where the Ni(II) ions are coordinated to labile solvent molecules (S: DMF or CH3CN). 1H and 133Cs paramagnetic NMR studies show that (i) the cubic complex is relatively stable during several days in solution, in particular in acetonitrile and (ii) a Cs+ ion can be inserted inside the cubic cavity as revealed by the presence of a strongly shifted 133Cs paramagnetic signal near -800 ppm at 300 K. The resulting Cs subset of{[Fe(Tp)(CN)3]4[Ni(S)3]4}5+ procube shows an enhanced stability as shown by time dependent 1H and 133Cs paramagnetic NMR spectra collected during several weeks. FT-IR spectra confirm the expected Fe(III) and Ni(II) redox states, with the occurrence of a single characteristic cyanide stretching vibration near 2170 cm-1. The Fe(III) redox state is also confirmed by cyclic voltammetry experiments in acetonitrile, with the occurrence of four pseudoreversible reduction events that can be assigned to the successive reduction of the FeIII ions in the Cs procube. Although these procubes could not be isolated as single crystals, the substitution of the labile coordinated solvent of the Cs-containing procube by N-donor imidazole monodentate ligands allows the crystallization of the novel Cs subset of{[Fe(Tp)(CN)3]4- [NiII(Im)3]4}Cl3 (Im = 1H imidazole) cubic complex by slow diffusion of ether into a DMF mother solution. The analyses of this cube demonstrate that in solution in ambient condition, Fe(III) centers are gradually reduced to Fe(II). The presence of three chlorides as counterions suggests that the cube can be isolated in the FeII2FeIII2NiII4 redox state. The presence of at least two Fe(II) ions is actually confirmed by cyclic voltammetry experiment in DMF and FT-IR spectroscopy. An intermediate state FeIIFeIII3NiII4 can be isolated by isolating fresh crystals (ca. 72 h) as demonstrated by FT-IR, cyclic voltammetry, and the magnetic measurements, that also reveal the presence of paramagnetic ferromagnetic interactions between the low-spin FeIII and NiII ions.

TI An ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical assay for tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha based on hollow CdS cubes as a signal generator and
   NiCo2O4-Au as a signal extinguisher
SO ANALYST
AB Sensitive detection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) in human serum is beneficial for finding cancer patients early due to overexpressed TNF-a being related to some cancers. Here, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor was constructed for ultrasensitive TNF-a assay based on the signal generator of hollow CdS cubes (H-CdS) and the signal extinguishing activity of NiCo2O4-Au. In this work, compared with traditional solid CdS, H-CdS could greatly promote the PEC signal because its hollow structure could accelerate the separation of photogenerated charges, which also possesses abundant active sites and high light absorption capability. Moreover, H-CdS can be prepared facilely with Cd-based Prussian blue analogs as the precursor. Meanwhile, NiCo2O4-Au was fabricated and utilized as a signal extinguisher. In the presence of TNF-a, NiCo2O4-Au could be introduced onto the H-CdS modified electrode, producing competitive consumption of the electron donor effect, the p-n semiconductor quenching effect, and the mimetic enzymatic catalytic precipitation effect, which all can significantly reduce the PEC signal. Based on the signal extinguishing activity of NiCo2O4-Au and the signal generator of H-CdS, TNF-a can be detected sensitively with a lower detection limit (0.63 fg mL(-1)) and a wide linear range (1 fg mL(-1)- to 1 ng mL(-1)), which may have a potential application in the PEC bioanalysis field and the disease diagnostics field.

TI Synergistic enhancement of chemisorption and catalytic conversion in
   lithium-sulfur batteries via Co3Fe7/Co5.47N separator mediator
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) show considerable potential in next-generation high performance batteries, but the heavy shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfide hinder their further applications. In this paper, to address these shortcomings of LSBs, Co3Fe7/Co5.47N heterostructure were prepared and constructed from their Fe-Co Prussian blue analogue precursors under the condition of high temperature pyrolysis. The obtained Co3Fe7/Co5.47N display excellent immobilization-diffusion-conversion performance for polysulfides by synergistic effect in successfully hindering the shuttle effect of polysulfides. When the Co3Fe7/Co5.47N heterostructure were applied to modify the commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, the batteries displayed fantastic rate capacity and cycling stability. Specifically, the Co3Fe7/Co5.47N-PP batteries exhibit an extremely satisfactory initial specific capacity of 1430 m Ah/g at 0.5C, wonderful rate capacity of around 780 m Ah/g at 3C and superior per cycle decaying rate of 0.08 % for 500 cycles at 0.5C. When the current density reaches to 2C, the batteries still exhibit 501 m Ah/g after 900 cycles with 0.015 % per cycle decay rate. Besides, even in the high loading of sulfur (3.0 mg cm-2) at 0.5C, the superior cycling stability (0.075 % per cycle decay rate after 200 cycles) and high specific capacity (741 mAh/g after 200 cycles) can still be performed. Thus, this work provides a facile method for high-powered and long-life Li-S batteries with eminent entrapping-conversion processes of polysulfides.

TI Three-Fluid Sequential Micromixing-Assisted Nanoparticle Synthesis
   Utilizing Alternating Current Electrothermal Flow
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Multiple micromixing in a controlled sequence is an essential process for complex chemical synthesis of functional nanoparticles with desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we developed a unique sequential micromixing-assisted nanoparticle synthesis platform utilizing alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET). A two-fluid micromixer comprised with pairs of staggered asymmetric electrodes was first designed and characterized by joint numerical simulations and experiments to obtain the optimized electrode configuration within a straight channel. On this basis, an extra pair of symmetric electrodes was added at the main channel entrance to form a three-fluid sequential micromixer. The middle fluid would first mix with the side fluids through the symmetric ACET microvortex pair in the upstream region and then realize the side fluid mixing by the asymmetric ACET microvortex in the downstream region. Rapid and complete mixing in a short channel was observed for a relatively high flow velocity up to 7 mm/s at an AC signal of 27.5 V and 1 MHz. Sequential micromixing was achieved by flexibly adjusting the volume of each fluid and the AC voltage within the three-fluid mixer. Both the two-fluid mixing process and the three-fluid mixing process were applied to synthesize the Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles. In comparison with two-fluid mixing, three-fluid sequential mixing offers nanoparticles with higher dispersion, controlled particle morphology, and more regular shapes. Therefore, the ACET flow-based sequential micromixing strategy can be an alternative for complex chemical and biochemical reactions.

TI Ultrathin flaky FeSiAl and Fe3O4@C core-shell
   integrating the high-performance microwave absorber with gradient
   anti-corrosion barriers
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Heterogeneous interface engineering and magnetic coupling are the main promising strategies for efficient microwave absorbers, but getting them stable in high-salt and humidity environments remains a challenge. Herein, we developed ultrathin flaky FeSiAl(FSA) integrating with Fe3O4@C core-shell for the high-performance microwave absorber with gradient anti-corrosion barriers. The Fe-Prussian blue analogue (PBA) derived microcubes decorated ultrathin FSA are prepared and transformed into Fe3O4@C core-shell in range of 500 similar to 700 degrees C. The introduction of ferric oxide favors to impedance matching. Furthermore, the ultra-thin carbon layer and ferric oxide form a hybrid structure, which is conducive to enhancing electron spin and thereby enhancing microwave loss. This hybrid possess enhanced microwave absorption properties with a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of -45.5 dB at 9.2 GHz at a thickness of 2.5 mm. Moreover, the maximum effective absorption bandwidth value reaches 5.2 GHz from 12.8 to 18 GHz at 1.6 mm. The gradient carbon layers and Fe3O4 provided the bi-barriers towards corrosive medium. Then corrosion resistance of the electric circuit increased up to 3.56x10(7) Omega center dot cm(2) for FSA/Fe3O4@C-600. Meanwhile, the corresponding corrosion current decreased into 2.52x10(-8) A center dot cm(-2). Hence, introducing multi-heterointerfaces and dual-magnetic components opens up a fantastic avenue for designing high-efficient absorbers with gradient anti-corrosion barriers.

TI Self-supporting, hierarchically hollow structured NiFe-PBA
   electrocatalyst for efficient alkaline seawater oxidation
SO NANOSCALE
AB Seawater electrolysis, taking advantage of the huge seawater resource, holds great promise for sustainable hydrogen generation. Compared to conventional water electrolysis, seawater electrolysis is more challenging because of the more complex and corrosive electrolyte and competitive side reactions, which necessitates the development of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts. In this study, a self-supporting, highly porous NiFe-PBA (Prussian-blue-analogue) electrocatalyst with a hierarchically hollow nanostructure is introduced, which exhibits impressive catalytic performance towards the oxygen evolution in alkaline seawater electrolytes. In NiFe-PBA, the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe improves intrinsic conductivity for efficient electron transfer, enhances chemical stability in seawater, and boosts overall electrocatalytic activity. The direct use of self-supporting NiFe-PBA as an electrocatalyst avoids the energy-intensive and tedious pyrolysis procedure during the preparation process while making use of the tailored morphological, structural, and compositional benefits of PBA-based materials. By combining the NiFe-PBA catalyst with the NiMoN cathode, the constructed two-electrode electrolyzer achieved a high current density of 500 mA cm-2 at a low cell voltage of 1.782 V for overall electrolysis of alkaline seawater, demonstrating excellent durability for 100 hours. Our findings have important implications for the hydrogen economy and sustainable development through the development of robust and efficient PBA-based electrocatalysts for seawater electrolysis.
   A self-supporting, highly porous NiFe-PBA catalyst with a hierarchically hollow nanostructure is prepared for efficient overall seawater electrolysis, which holds great promise for sustainable hydrogen generation.

TI Synthesis of Fe3Se4/CoFe/NSeC@NSeC for fast and longevous energy storage
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The applications of metal chalcogenides in Li/Na-ion storage are limited by their low intrinsic conductivity and structure pulverization, which result in capacity reduction and low-rate performance. To overcome these limitations, herein, a core-shell box structure consisting of Fe3Se4 and Co7Fe3 alloying compound integrated with N, Se-doped carbon core and N, Se-doped carbon shell (denoted as Fe3Se4/CoFe/NSeC@ NSeC) is fabricated successfully using an initial selenization/carbonization and subsequent thermal in-duction strategy of the corresponding hollow CoFe-Prussian Blue analogue box precursor. The possible formation mechanism of Fe3Se4/CoFe/NSeC@NSeC is proposed. The core-shell Fe3Se4/CoFe/NSeC@NSeC with the void space can accommodate the volume expansion and facilitate Li+/Na+ dissolusion on cycling, while the resulting Co7Fe3 alloy compound and NSeC can synergistically accelerate the conductivity of the electrode material from local and overall aspects for rapid electron and ion transportation. As a result, the Fe3Se4/CoFe/NSeC@NSeC box anode exhibits superior electrochemical performance in both LIBs and SIBs, such as a reversible specific capacity of 976.6 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and even 782.5 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 for LIBs, and 324 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 for SIBs, respectively. The improved Li/Na storage properties of the composite demonstrate the significance of meticulously constructing novel multicomponent hierarchical structures with higher complexity.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Phase-Controlled Synthesis of Nickel-Iron Nitride Nanocrystals Armored
   with Amorphous N-Doped Carbon Nanoparticles Nanocubes for Enhanced
   Overall Water Splitting
SO SMALL
AB Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) nanostructures possess distinctive electronic, optical, and catalytic properties, showing great promise to apply in clean energy, optoelectronics, and catalysis fields. Nonetheless, phase-regulation of NiFe-bimetallic nitrides nanocrystals or nanohybrid architectures confronts challenges and their electrocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) performances are underexplored. Herein, novel pure-phase Ni2+xFe2-xN nanocrystals armored with amorphous N-doped carbon (NC) nanoparticles nanocubes (NPNCs) are obtained by controllable nitridation of NiFe-Prussian-blue analogues derived oxides/NC NPNCs under Ar/NH3 atmosphere. Such Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC NPNCs possess mesoporous structures and show enhanced electrocatalytic activity in 1 m KOH electrolyte with the overpotential of 101 and 270 mV to attain 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) current toward hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, outperforming their counterparts (mixed-phase NiFe2O4/Ni3FeN/NC and NiFe oxides/NC NPNCs). Remarkably, utilizing them as bifunctional catalysts, the assembled Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC||Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC electrolyzer only needs 1.51 V cell voltage for driving OWS to approach 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current, exceeding their counterparts and the-state-of-art reported bifunctional catalysts-based devices, and Pt/C||IrO2 couples. Additionally, the Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC||Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC manifests excellent durability for OWS. The findings presented here may spur the development of advanced TMNs nanostructures by combining phase, structure engineering, and hybridization strategies and stimulate their applications toward OWS or other clean energy fields.

TI Investigating electrochemical behavior of cobalt
   pentacyano(methylaniline)ferrate(II) in various aqueous electrolytes for
   supercapacitor application
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Electrolytes play a significant role in improving the stability and specific capacity of supercapacitors; however, they have gained less attention compared to the designing of electrode materials. This study presents the supercapacitor application of novel Prussian blue analog (PBA)-based fabricated electrodes in different electrolytes. PBA was derived by the ligand substitution of sodium pentacyanonitrosyl ferrate(iii) dihydrate followed by precipitation with cobalt salt to yield cobalt pentacyano(methylaniline)ferrate(ii) (CoPCF). The fabricated electrode exhibited specific capacity of 390, 233, 175, and 83 mA h g(-1) in 3 M KOH, 1 M NaOH, 1 M LiOH, and 1 M KNO3 at 1 A g(-1) with capacity retention of 88.80%, 89.95%, 92.42%, and 90.80%, respectively, after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was fabricated using a PVA/KOH polymer gel electrolyte that exhibited a specific capacity of 56 mA h g(-1) with a specific energy density of 71 W h kg(-1) and a specific power density of 2560 W kg(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), with excellent capacity retention of 93% over 2000 continuous (dis)charge cycles. These results demonstrated that the introduction of organic ligands in the framework of PBAs along with the selection of the right electrolyte is an effective strategy in the development of high-capacity and stable supercapacitor electrodes.

TI Multifunctional MnCo@C yolk-shell nanozymes with smartphone platform for
   rapid colorimetric analysis of total antioxidant capacity and phenolic
   compounds
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB Accurate on-site analysis of food quality, environmental pollutants, and disease biomarkers is of great signifi-cance for safeguarding public health. In this work, based on the novel nanozymes, MnCo oxides@carbon yolk-shell nanocages (MnCo@C NCs), a portable colorimetric sensor with smartphone platform has been developed for rapid, on-site and quantitative analysis of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and phenolic compounds. The MnCo@C NCs are synthesized via one-step calcination of polydopamine-coated MnCo Prussian blue analogs (MnCo-PBA@PDA). The PDA-derived carbon shell is found to be able to protect the nanocages from collapsing, thus increasing their specific surface areas and porosity. Benefiting from the unique structure and multivalent MnCo bimetallic oxides, the MnCo@C NCs perform outstanding catalytic performance and multiple enzyme-mimicking activities including oxidase, laccase and catalase. Hence, a multifunctional application platform in-tegrated smartphone has been constructed for rapid and sensitive colorimetric detection of three model analytes (i.e., ascorbic acid (AA), 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DP), and epinephrine) with extremely low detection limits of 0.29 mu M, 0.76 mu M, and 0.70 mu M, respectively. This sensor device is successfully applied in TAC analysis in vegetables, fruits, and beverages, as well as epinephrine determination in human serum samples. This work provides new insights into designing multifunctional nanozymes to advance the instant detection technology in the field of food supervision, environment monitoring, and human health.

TI NiCo-NiCoO2/carbon hollow nanocages for non-enzyme glucose
   detection
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Hybrid transition metals/metal oxides/carbon bases with adjustable structures are becoming more and more important and attractive as electrode materials for electrocatalysis of glucose. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of carbon encapsulated hollow cage NiCo-NiCoO2 composite (NiCo-NiCoO2/C), which were synthesized by a two-step procedure involving preparation of nickel-cobalt Prussian blue analogue (Ni-Co PBA) derivative (NiO-NiCo2O4) and an organic carbon source, and the synthesis of the nanocomposite at 400 degrees C for direct carbonization and reduction process in an Ar atmosphere. As a multicomponent electrocatalyst for glucose oxidation in alkaline solution, the unique structure provides a large accessible surface area, while the uniformly distributed NiCoO2, NiCo, and C effectively catalyze and facilitate the glucose reaction. The sensitivity of the catalyst were 340.4 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and 56.1 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) in the linear concentration ranges of 0.1 mu M-600 mu M and 0.9 mM-6.3 mM, respectively, and the LOD was 0.03 mu M with good reproducibility and long-term stability. Besides, the effective performance of the sensor material in detecting glucose in real human serum has been recognized. The NiCo-NiCoO2/C annealed at an appropriate temperature has high electronic conductivity, large surface area, and faster ion/electron transfer at the electrode and electrolyte-electrode interface, resulting in a higher electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose ability.

TI A magnetic dual-aptamer electrochemical sensor with MOF-on-MOF-derived
   electrocatalyst as a signal amplifier for sensitive detection of cardiac
   troponin I
SO TALANTA
AB Considering the close association between cardiac troponin I (cTnI) level and various cardiovascular diseases, it becomes essential to explore sensitive and accurate detection methods for monitoring their levels in the early stages of disease. In this work, a magnetic dual-aptamer electrochemical sensor for cTnI detection was constructed in the first utilizing MOF-on-MOF-derived electrocatalyst as a signal amplifier in collaboration with high-efficient separation of magnetic beads (MBs). Employing zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) with high surface area as host MOF, MOF-on-MOF heterostructure (ZIF-67@PBA) was facilely prepared by in-situ growth of conductive prussian blue analogue (PBA) as guest MOF onto the surface of ZIF-67 with a simple ion-exchange method. After low-temperature calcination, N doped derived electrocatalyst (N-ZIF-67@PBA) was obtained with intact skeletons and pore structures of MOFs. This not only integrated bimetallic active centers with various valence states and diversiform nanostructures of dual MOF, but endowed N-ZIF-67@PBA 8.3-fold increase of electrocatalytic activity for catalytic amplification. Further using aptamer-modified MBs as capture carriers for recognizing and separating cTnI from complex samples with high specificity, the magnetic dualaptamer sensor successfully achieved the sensitive detection of cTnI with a low detection limit of 0.31 fg/mL. This work provided a new viewpoint on the use of MOF-on-MOF-derived electrocatalyst for ultrasensitive electrochemical sensing analysis.

TI Sulfur-Induced Electronic Optimization of N-Doped Carbon with
   CoP/Co2P Heterostructure by Precursor Design for Rechargeable
   Zinc-Air Batteries
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Heteroatom doping and heterostructure construction are the key methods to improve the performance of electrocatalysts. However, developing such catalysts remains a challenging task. Herein, we designed two comparable polymers, phytic acid/thiourea polymer (PATP) and phytic acid/urea polymer (PAUP), as precursors, which contain C, N, S/O, and P by microwave heating. To pinpoint how the introduction of sulfur would affect the electronic structure and catalytic activity, these two polymers were physically blended with CoCo-Prussian blue analogue (CoCo-PBA) and further calcination, respectively. The highly dispersed CoP/Co2P-rich interfacial catalysts anchored on the N,S-codoped or N-doped carbon support were successfully prepared (CoP/Co2P@CNS and CoP/Co2P@CN). The prepared CoP/Co2P@CNS catalyst showed good ORR properties (E-1/2 = 0.856 V vs RHE) and OER properties (E-j10 = 1.54 V vs RHE), which were superior to the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. The reversible oxygen electrode index (Delta E = E-j10 - E-1/2) can reach similar to 0.684 V. Meanwhile, the rechargeable zinc-air battery assembled with a CoP/Co2P@CNS catalyst as the air cathode also showed excellent performance, with a charge-discharge cycle stability of up to 900 h. DFT calculations further confirm that the introduction of S atoms can affect the electronic structure and enhance the catalytic activity of C and N atoms on carbon support.

TI Anchoring of Ag into binary PBs-SOF heterostructure composite enhances
   selective radioactive iodine adsorption: Intrinsic affinity and
   interconnected framework
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Under the premise of rational use of nuclear resources such as radioactive iodine and proper disposal of water pollution in the nuclear reaction process, it is expected to achieve low-carbon goals with the help of high-energy output nuclear power. However, iodine ions are highly mobile and can easily escape into natural water, even-tually posing a health hazard to humans. Thus, engineering efficient iodine adsorbents and underlying removal mechanisms have attracted widespread attention. Here we report that uniformly-dispersed Ag atoms on supra-molecular organic frameworks support with Co-Fe Prussian blue analogs doped (Ag@SOF@Co-Fe PBs) on its facets show the most outstanding capability for iodine adsorption due to the strong double-substrate interaction and surface co-precipitation effect. We have carefully investigated the doping effect of PBs and the anchoring effect of Ag on SOF during the step-by-step optimization process. The nanorod framework of SOF, effective active sites of PBs, and the strong co-precipitation effect of Ag are confirmed to play a synergistic role in facilitating electron migration on the interface intersection, and improving the iodine intrinsic affinity and removal capacity. The Ag@SOF@Co-Fe PBs composite demonstrated superior iodine capture performance (388.39 mg/g), high selectivity, and excellent adsorption rate, which proves the potentially practical application of these materials. This study provides a promising strategy for optimizing iodine adsorption materials.

TI Polyethylene Glycol-Na<SUP>+</SUP> Interface of Vanadium
   Hexacyanoferrate Cathode for Highly Stable Rechargeable Aqueous
   Sodium-Ion Battery
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Vanadium hexacyanoferrate (VHCF) with an open-framework crystal structure is a promising cathode material for rechargeable aqueous metal-ion batteries owing to its high electrochemical performance and easy synthesis. In this paper, vanadium hexacyanoferrate cathodes were first used for constructing rechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries (VHCF/WO3) and tested in the new-type electrolyte (NaP-4.6) consisting of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)/H2O/NaClO4 electrolyte with a low H+ concentration (molar ratio of [H2O]/[Na+] is 4.6), which has high stability at a high current density as high as 1000 mA g(-1) with a capacity retention of 90.3% after 2000 cycles at high coulombic efficiency (above 97.8%). To understand their outstanding performance, the proton-assisted sodium-ion storage mechanism and interphase chemistry of VHCF are investigated by solid-state NMR (ssNMR) technology. It is suggested that the H+ storage reaction is accompanied by the redox of vanadium atoms and Na+ intercalation is accompanied by the redox of iron atoms. It is also observed that the complex of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with Na+ (PEG-Na+) exists on the VHCF surface, which facilitates the stability of VHCF and promotes the alkali-ion transfer at a high current density. The results of the ssNMR study offer new insights into the intercalation chemistry of Prussian blue analogues with open-framework-structured compounds, which can greatly broaden our horizons for battery research.

TI Photocatalytic degradation of oxytetracycline under visible light by
   nanohybrids of CoFe alloy nanoparticles and nitrogen-/sulfur-codoped
   mesoporous carbon
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Efficient photodegradation of antibiotics in water systems is significant for environmental restoration and water purification. In this work, a series of catalysts for oxytetracycline (OTC) degradation under visible light was proposed. The hybrids (denoted by CoFe@NSC) of CoFe alloy and N/S-codoped mesoporous carbon were obtained by annealing CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe PBA) nanocubes under different temperatures using thioacetamide as the N and S resource. The CoFe@NSC photocatalysts show substantially boosted photocatalytic activity for OTC degradation compared with that of the CoFe PBA catalyst. Among the three CoFe@NSC hybrids obtained by pyrolyzing at 800 degrees C, 900 degrees C, and 1000 degrees C, the CoFe@NSC-1000 hybrid at 1000 degrees C exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity toward OTC degradation under visible light irradiation for its highly conjugated nanostructure, large specific surface area (733.0 m2 g-1), enhanced visible light absorption capacity, and improved separation/migration rate for photogenerated charge carriers. Approximately 90% of OTC was degraded by CoFe@NSC-1000 catalyst after visible light irradiation for 150 min. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and trapping tests indicate that the photoinduced superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are the main active species for photodegradation. The possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on the active species, trapping experiments and ESR analysis. The biotoxicity of photocatalytic degradation products and residual antibiotic were also explored using E. coli as the reference organism. This work offers new insight into the development of novel catalysts for photodegradation of antibiotics.

TI Liquid-phase step-by-step growth of an iron cyanide coordination
   framework on LiCoO2 particle surfaces
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Surface modification of inorganic objects with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) - organic-inorganic hybrid framework materials with infinite networks - opens wide windows for potential applications. In order to derive a target property, the key is the ability to fine tune the degree of modification. Solution-based step-by-step growth techniques provide excellent control of layer thickness which can be varied with the number of deposition cycles. Such techniques with MOFs have been mainly applied to flat substrates, but not to particle surfaces before. Here, we present the facile surface modification of inorganic particles with a framework compound under operationally simple ambient conditions. A solution-based sequential technique involving the alternate immersion of LiCoO2 (LCO) - a positive electrode material for a lithium ion battery - into FeCl2 center dot 4H(2)O and K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] solutions results in the formation of Prussian blue (PB) nanolayers on the surface of the LCO particles (PBNL@LCO). The PB growth is finely controlled by the number of immersion cycles. An electrochemical cell with PBNL@LCO as a positive electrode material exhibits a discharge capacity close to the specific capacity of LCO. The results open a new direction for creating suitable interfacial conditions between electrode materials and electrolytes in secondary battery materials.

TI Enhancing Voltage Output in Polyanion-Type Cathode Materials for Sodium
   Ion Batteries
SO BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising in several aspects due to their many advantages over lithium-ion batteries. Among SIB's several outstanding attributes, its low cost, resource abundance, and potential safety make it suitable for large-scale energy storage systems (ESS). Among the potential cathode materials, poly-anionic cathode materials could be a better choice for their stability and safety in comparison to layered transition metal oxides and Prussian blue analogues (PBA). However, on the other hand, the conductivity as well as the available capacity of the polyanion compounds are still poor, which limits their applications; moreover, some polyanion cathode operate at low voltage, which reduces the energy density and raises the cost of the battery system. We here try to summarize the recent progress of polyanion compounds as cathode materials for SIB. These compounds are categorized based on the metal redox couple, including V-, Cr-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, and Ni-polyanion compounds. Our attention is specifically drawn to properties such as reversible redox voltage, capacity, cycling stability, and sodium storage mechanisms. We also discuss the challenges and potential development strategies for the future.
   The development of sodium-ion batteries is constrained by the characteristics of the positive electrode materials. This article provides an overview of the progress in positive electrode materials from the perspectives of energy density, operating voltage, environmental impact, safety, and resource availability. It discusses the advancements made in these areas and explores potential future directions for development. image

TI Sustainable regeneration of spent cathodes for lithium-ion and
   post-lithium-ion batteries
SO NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
AB The accelerating adoption of electric vehicles supports the transition to a more sustainable transport sector. However, the retiring of many electric vehicles over the next decade poses a sustainability challenge, particularly due to the lack of recycling of end-of-life batteries. Here we show regeneration routes that could valorize spent cathodes for a second life in both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and post-LIBs. Our regeneration starts with a leaching process involving acetic acid that could selectively dissolve high-value elements in cathodes including lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese. Depending on the added chelating agents, further co-precipitation reactions in the leachate form precursors of different cathode materials. The regenerated lithium layered oxide cathodes deliver a reversible area capacity of up to 2.73 mAh cm-2 with excellent structural stability for LIBs, whereas the obtained Prussian blue analogues show 83.7% retention after 2,000 cycles for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Life-cycle and techno-economic assessments suggest that the current regeneration can reduce manufacturing costs for LIBs and SIBs by US$21.65 kWh-1 and US$41.67 kWh-1, respectively, with lower impacts on human health, environment and natural resources. This work paves the way for the transition to more sustainable storage technologies.
   Battery recycling is essential to the sustainability of electric vehicles. Here the authors show processes that could regenerate spent cathode materials for a second life in lithium-ion and post-lithium-ion batteries.

TI Hydrogen evolution under large-current-density based on fluorine-doped
   cobalt-iron phosphides
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Developing the transition metal-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under large-current-density is crucial for industrial electrolysis of water. However, most of reported HER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution are tested under the current density of less than 100 mA cm(-2). In this work, CoFe Prussian blue analogues (PBA) supported on iron foam (IF) as precursor can (has been) be utilized to construct the fluorine-doped cobalt-iron phosphides (F-Co2P/Fe2P/IF). At the large-current-density at 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA cm-2, we systematically investigate the HER performance of F-Co2P/Fe2P/IF. Compared to the electrocatalyst without F- doping, F-Co2P/Fe2P/IF only need the low overpotential of 229.8, 260.5, 292.2 and 304.4 mV, respectively, when reaching the large current of 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 mA cm(-2). The F doping may induce the valence state and electronic structure of Co and Fe ions for enhanced HER activity. The role of F doping is furtherly analyzed by introducing barium ions as precipitation agent. At the same time, it can maintain for a long-term stability in 1.0 and 6.0 M KOH at the different high current density. The stableF-Co2P/Fe2P/IF may bear the high current density and high temperature during industrial water electrolysis. This work enables it possible at the large current density for industrial water splitting.

TI Mxene-Cu Electrified Membranes with Confined Lamellar Channels for the
   Flow-through Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied as cathodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to their three-dimensional framework structure and easily adjustable composition. However, the phase transition behavior and [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) anionic defects severely deteriorate electrochemical performances. Herein, we propose a defect-free potassium iron manganese hexacyanoferrate (K1.47Fe0.5Mn0.5[Fe(CN)(6)]<middle dot>1.26H(2)O, KFMHCF-1/2) as the cathode material for PIBs. The Fe-Mn binary synergistic and defect-free effects can inhibit the cell volume change and octahedral slip during the K-ion insertion/extraction process, so that the phase transformation behavior (monoclinic <-> cubic) is effectively inhibited, achieving a zero-strain solid solution mechanism employing Fe and Mn as dual active-sites. Thus, KFMHCF-1/2 contributes the highest initial capacity of 155.3 mAh<middle dot>g(-1) with an energy density of 599.5 Wh<middle dot>kg(-1) at 10 mA<middle dot>g(-1) among the reported PBA cathodes, superior rate capability, and cyclic stability over 450 cycles. The assembled K-ion full battery using K deposited on graphite (K@G) as anode also delivers high reversible specific capacity of 131.1 mAh<middle dot>g(-1) at 20 mA<middle dot>g(-1) and ultralong lifespans over 1000 cycles at 50 mA<middle dot>g(-1) with the lowest capacity decay rate of 0.044% per cycle. This work will promote the rapid application of high-energy-density PIBs.

TI Tri-functional carbon nanocages coated CoNi electrocatalyst with micro
   twinning structure for high-performance electrochemical devices
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The twinning structure could lead to unexpected effects on electrocatalytic performance; however, research on relevant mechanisms is still rare and there is still a lack of an effective and convenient strategy to introduce twinning structures into nanoparticles. In this work, inspired by the in -situ fcc-hcp phase transition in metals and benefiting from the features of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), N -doped carbon cages -coated CoNi nanoparticles, which contain multi -active sites including alloyed nanoparticles, micro twinning structures and single atom sites could be effectively fabricated by pyrolyzing of CoNi-based PBAs. The catalyst exhibits an obvious enhancement in oxygen evolution/reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions. Theoretical calculations verify that the micro -twinning structures originating from the fcc-hcp phase transition promote electrocatalytic activities significantly due to the optimized adsorption energy towards different intermediates. Moreover, the synergic effect between the multi -active sites may further optimize the electronic structures and lead to the deviation from the Scaling Effect. The water -splitting device and Zinc -Air battery are also assembled based on this micro- twinning electrocatalyst, which yields a maximum power density of 95 mW cm -2 and a low voltage of 1.76 V to reach 10 mA cm -2 current density, respectively. In all, this work contributes a simple and universal strategy to introduce both the multi -active sites and the twinning structure into transition metal -based catalysts, which improves the multi -catalytic activity towards different reactions significantly.

TI Efficient Photochemical, Thermal, and Electrochemical Water Oxidation
   Catalyzed by a Porous Iron-Based Oxide Derived Metal Organic Framework
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Iron-based catalysts are of particular interest for water oxidation because of their high abundance, low toxicity, and rich redox properties. Herein, we report low cost porous iron-based oxides derived from calcining precursors of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) M-x[Fe(CN)(6)](y) (M = Fe, Co, Ni). This synthesis approach involves a simple self-assembly technology and a low-temperature annealing procedure. These catalysts were investigated for photocatalytic, cerium(IV)-driven, and electrochemical water oxidation, and they exhibited superior activity. It is noteworthy that this photocatalytic water oxidation was conducted under neutral conditions that are similar to the natural photosystem II. The high initial turnover frequency (TOF) of similar to 5.4 x 10(-4) s(-1) per transition metal atom at the first 60 s is obtained under neutral pH using porous CoxFe3-xO4 in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction, which is comparable with those published iron-based catalysts. Under cerium(IV)-driven water oxidation conditions, the TOF of porous CoxFe3-xO4 is 5.2 x 10(-4) s(-1) per transition metal atom, which is the highest value among all the documented iron oxides. In the electrochemical water oxidation, the porous NixFe3-xO4 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 402 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the porous iron-based oxides possess beneficial ferromagnetic properties and excellent stability so that they were used repeatedly without loss in activity.

The heterostructure was obtained via a first hydrothermal approach to obtain hollow Co3S4 nanoboxes based on the ionic exchange reaction between Fe(CN)(6)(3-) of Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) and S2- at 120 degrees C, and the subsequent in situ growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of Co3S4 nanoboxes at an elevated temperature of 200 degrees C. The synergistic effects between the active and stable HER catalyst of MoS2 and the efficient OER catalyst of Co3S4, as well as the morphological superiority of hollow and core-shell structures, endow Co3S4@MoS2 with remarkable electrocatalytic performance and robust durability toward overall water splitting. As a result, the designed non-noble electrocatalyst of Co3S4@MoS2 exhibits a low overpotential of 280 mV for OER and 136 mV for HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution. Meanwhile, a low cell voltage of 1.58 V is achieved by using the heterostructure as both anode and cathode catalysts. This work paves the way to the design and construction of other prominent electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

TI Double functionalization strategy toward Co-Fe-P hollow nanocubes for
   highly efficient overall water splitting with ultra-low cell voltage
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Due to their inherent structural and functional defects, most bifunctional catalysts usually delivered excellent electrocatalytic activities for one half-reaction at expense of the performances for another one, thus exhibiting inconspicuous electrocatalytic abilities for overall-water-splitting. In the present work, a novel strategy of controllable assembly and synergistic catalysis based on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active single functional sites, was ingeniously assembled to high-performance catalysts for overall-water-splitting. Monodispersed zeolitic imidazolate framework cubes were adopted as the reaction precursors to construct bi-functional electrocatalysts through conformal Prussian blue analogue layer coating and the subsequent thermal phosphorization process. HER active Co-P and OER active Co-Fe-P hetero-components were simultaneously anchored on the shell layers of the resulted Co-Fe-P hollow nanoboxes. Benefiting from the unique structural design and functional integration, the product catalyst afforded small overpotentials of 174 and 53 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for the OER and HER in alkaline media, respectively and a ultra-low operating cell voltage of 1.46 V for overall-water-splitting, superior to most recently reported striking bi-functional electrocatalysts. Moreover, its ultrastable catalytic activity was also impressive, delivering only negligible performance loss after a 24 h durability testing. More broadly, this combined double functionalization concept and nanoscale hollowing design is unique and advantageous, especially suitable for developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts of energy conversion reactions.

TI Influence of A/B Element Substitution on Negative Thermal Expansion in
   AB(CN)6 (A = Al, Ga, In; B = Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V, Ti): A
   Density Functional Theory Study
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Negative thermal expansion as an abnormal physical behavior of materials has promising applications in a high sophisticated equipment field, but the materials are rare. Here, we use the first-principles calculations based on density functional theory combined with the recently developed average atomic volume (AAV = V/N, where V is unit cell volume and N is the number of atoms in the unit) rule to predict the large isotropic negative thermal expansion materials of Prussian blue analogues AB-(CN)6 (A = Al, Ga, In; B = Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V, Ti) in a wide temperature range. Our results clearly show that the coefficient of negative thermal expansion has a near-linear relationship with the average atomic volume of the systems and is also influenced by the element substitution at the A or B site. Lattice dynamic simulations indicate that the main contribution to the negative thermal expansion comes from the low-frequency transverse vibration of the (B)-C?N-(A) groups, especially the transverse vibration of the N atoms. Thus, the element substitution at the A site (binding to N) can tune the negative thermal expansion behavior of the systems more effectively than that at the B site (binding to C), indicating the different roles of bonds on the negative thermal expansion. Our present work not only expands the kinds of isotropic materials but also gives some insights into the relationship between the average atomic volume and negative thermal expansion.

TI Interfacial Engineering of the CoxP-Fe2P
   Heterostructure for Efficient and Robust Electrochemical Overall Water
   Splitting
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Development of efficient, stable, and low-cost noble metal-free electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is of great significance for sustainable energy conversion, yet it remains highly challenging. Herein, a CoxP-Fe2P heterostructure array electrocatalyst supported on nickel foam (CoxP-Fe2P/NF) is fabricated via phosphating of the CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) nanosheets decorated with CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) nanocubes. The as-fabricated CoxP-Fe2P/NF heterostructure arrays with an abundant and strongly electronic coupled interface not only guarantee the fast charge transfer and improve the reaction kinetics but also enable the charge redistribution between CoxP and Fe2P, thus possibly optimizing the adsorption capabilities of reactants. Benefiting from the compositional and structural advantages, this as-fabricated CoxP-Fe2P/NF heterostructure can efficiently convert water to H-2 and O-2 with the potentials of 75 and 265 mV to achieve the current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-1) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Especially, when CoxP-Fe2P/NF is used as both anode and cathode materials, a cell voltage of 1.61 V is required at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability in long-term operation over 100 h, which is comparable to Pt/C/NF parallel to RuO2/NF. This work highlights the key roles of the interface in accelerating the electrocatalytic reaction kinetics and paves a way for the design of a high-performance electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.

TI Engineering of N doped carbon@FeCo alloy hollow spheres: Remarkable
   mid-frequency electromagnetic wave absorption performance exhibited by
   unique porous and wrinkled surface structure
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The modulation of the shape and design of microstructures plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficient absorption of electromagnetic waves in absorbers. The electromagnetic parameters and scattering effects of these materials are directly influenced by their morphological characteristics. In this study, polystyrene microspheres were used as templates for a two-step in-situ growth process: Initially, Fe(3)O(4 )was coated onto the surfaces of these microspheres, followed by the in-situ growth of Fe-Co Prussian blue analogs. The rational design of electrical parameters during the conversion process was calculated and analyzed using Density Functional Theory. The precursor was calcined at various temperatures to generate a unique porous wrinkled surface hollow nanostructure. This nanostructure not only facilitates multiple reflections and scattering of incident electromagnetic waves but also promotes the occurrence of multiple interface polarizations. Doping with nitrogen and oxygen elements introduced abundant dipole polarization, thereby enhancing the electromagnetic wave attenuation capability of the composite material. The Fe3O4@PBA composite material synthesized at 600 degrees C achieved a minimum reflection loss of -57.01 dB and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth of 4.58 GHz (7.52-12.1 GHz) at a thickness of 4 mm, covering nearly the entire X-band. This method provides a means to enhance magnetic loss by temperature adjustment to control the magnetic components in composite materials, providing a systematic approach to designing the microstructure of materials used for absorbing electromagnetic waves.

TI NiCo-compounds inside and outside N-doped carbon nanotubes to construct
   a double-enhanced hierarchical structure for high energy density
   supercapacitors
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Attaining a high energy density that aligns with practical application requirements is a crucial indicator in the advancement of supercapacitors. In this paper, a hybrid hierarchical electrode structure of N-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) spheres encapsulated with NiCo-Se nanoparticles (NPs) and coated with nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) multilayer nanosheets was successfully synthesized on a nickel foam (NF) substrate. The self-supporting strategy enables nickel-cobalt Prussian blue analogues (Ni-Co PBAs) to be directly attached to the NF surface, which results in fluffy NCNTs with a high length-diameter ratio and considerable yield and greatly enhances the conductivity of the electrode material. The synergistic interaction between the dual transition metal compounds inside and outside the NCNTs enables the hybrid electrode material to achieve an impressive specific capacity of 1899 F g-1 (211.0 mA h g-1) at 1 A g-1. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) exhibits an excellent energy density of 57.6 W h kg-1 at a power density of 798 W kg-1. This study not only provides an attractive strategy for obtaining CNTs with excellent properties from Ni-Co PBA and synthesizing hybrid electrodes with efficient synergistic effects, but also achieves a high energy density that aligns with the practical application demands of supercapacitors.
   The structure consists of N-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) spheres wrapped with NiCo-Se nanoparticles (NPs) and coated with nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) multilayer nanosheets.

TI A hierarchical Co3O4/CoS microbox heterostructure
   as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable
   Zn-air batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Herein, we report the synthesis of a strongly coupled Co3O4/CoS microbox heterostructure, prepared through an annealing treatment with the subsequent hydrothermal sulfidation of a Co-Co Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor. The unique 3D hierarchical architecture and potential synergies of Co3O4 and CoS provide benefits to the Co3O4/CoS heterostructure for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). It displays comparable ORR catalytic activity (half-wave potential of 0.820 V) to state-of-the-art Pt/C but better durability and methanol tolerance. The Co3O4/CoS electrocatalyst also shows high OER activity with a relatively low overpotential (349 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and small Tafel slope (66.6 mV dec(-1)), compared to those of commercial RuO2 (366 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 86.3 mV dec(-1), respectively), making it a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the ORR and the OER. Moreover, a rechargeable Zn-air battery with a Co3O4/CoS cathode shows a higher cell voltage (1.51 V), higher power density (168 mW cm(-2) at 269 mA cm(-2)), and better cycling stability (up to 150 cycles) than the same battery with the state-of-the-art Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst. This PBA-based material with a strongly coupled interface between Co3O4 and CoS offers insights into the development of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts for diverse energy-related applications.

TI Highly selective regulation of non-radical and radical mechanisms by Co
   cubic assembly catalysts for peroxymonosulfate activation
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation on efficient catalysts is a promising strategy to produce sulfate radical (SO4 center dot- ) and singlet oxygen (1O2) for the degradation of refractory organic pollutants. It is a great challenge to selectively generate these two reactive oxygen species, and the regulation mechanism from non-radical to radical pathway and vice versa is not well established. Here, we report a strategy to regulate the activation mechanism of PMS for the selective generation of SO4 center dot- and 1O2 with 100 % efficiency by sulfur-doped cobalt cubic assembly catalysts that was derived from the Co-Co Prussian blue analog precursor. This catalyst showed superior catalytic performance in activating PMS with normalized reaction rate increased by 87 times that of the commercial Co3O4 nanoparticles and had much lower activation energy barrier for the degradation of organic pollutant (e.g., p-chlorophenol) (18.32 kJ & sdot;mol- 1). Experimental and theoretical calculation results revealed that S doping can regulate the electronic structure of Co active centers, which alters the direction of electron transfer between catalyst and PMS. This catalyst showed a strong tolerance to common organic compounds and anions in water, wide environmental applicability, and performed well in different real-water systems. This study provides new opportunities for the development of metal catalyst with metal-organic frameworks structure and good self- regeneration ability geared specifically towards PMS-based advanced oxidation processes applied for water remediation.

TI Rechargeable Mg-Na and Mg-K hybrid batteries based on a low-defect
   Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocube cathode
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Rechargeable Mg-Li hybrid batteries have the merits of a Mg metal anode and a Li+ intercalation cathode, but the limited availability of Li resources hinders their large-scale application. Herein, rechargeable Mg-Na and Mg-K hybrid batteries are constructed with a low-defect Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanocube cathode. The large redox active cavities of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) are highly favorable for reversible Na+ and K+ intercalations. The Mg-Na and Mg-K hybrid batteries provide reversible capacities of 123 and 126 mA h g(-1), respectively, and a stable long-term cycling over 600 cycles. By contrast, the Mg-Li hybrid battery delivers a much lower capacity of 55 mA h g(-1). It is also demonstrated that controlled crystallization of well-defined nanocubes with few lattice defects is important for these high-capacity Mg-Na and Mg-K hybrid battery cathodes. The low-defect Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanocube cathode shows good rate capability, providing specific capacities of 45 and 53 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1) in Mg-Na and Mg-K hybrid batteries, respectively. This study illustrates that low-defect Prussian blue analogs of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) are highly compatible and promising cathodes for Mg-Na and Mg-K hybrid batteries. The present study also provides a new method for the development of low-cost and high-performance batteries based on Mg metal anodes.

TI CNT-modified two-phase manganese hexacyanoferrate as a superior cathode
   for sodium-ion batteries
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB The manganese-based Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the effective suppression of Fe(CN)(6) vacancies and removal of the absorbed and interstitial water in their crystal structures are two critical points to achieve excellent electrochemical performances. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNT) were employed to synthesize the hybrid KNa-MnFe(CN)(6)@CNT material via a facial concentration-gradient coprecipitation method. The systematic characterization of this material revealed that the water content was effectively reduced and a two-phase (monoclinic and cubic) structure was obtained. The well-designed hybrid KNa-MnFe(CN)(6)@CNT electrode exhibited an outstanding electrochemical performance with a very high initial discharge capacity of 164.5 mA h g(-1) (ICE = 96.3%) and high capacity retention of 82.0% after 100 cycles at the current density of 20 mA g(-1) in the voltage range of 2.0-4.2 V. In addition, a high rate performance of 77.3 mA h g(-1) was achieved at a current density of 1 A g(-1) due to the good adhesion between the PBA particles and CNT. The good structural reversibility of the KNa-MnFe(CN)(6)@CNT electrode was confirmed during the extraction/insertion process of alkali metal ions. Thus, this work provides a prospective strategy to develop high-performance hybrid manganese-based PBA cathode materials for SIBs.

TI Ligand-exchange-induced child-mother metal-organic frameworks derived a
   novel heterostructured iron-based carbon for neutral oxygen reduction in
   microbial fuel cell
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The slow neutral oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) impedes the efficiency of microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) for pollutants degradation and electricity generation, which requires active electrocatalysts to accelerate electron transfer. Iron-nitrogen-carbons (Fe-N-Cs) derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), acknowledged for low cost and high yield, are generally with unsatisfactory surface structure and low nitrogen/carbon contents, which leads to reduced active sites. To address this issue, herein, an ingenious ligand exchange strategy is proposed for the first time to construct a PBAs-based MOF@MOF precursor (Zn-ZIF-L@Zn-Fe PBA, MOF: metal-organic framework) by utilizing 2D leaf-shaped Zn-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Zn-ZIF-L) nanoplates to give birth to 3D Zn-Fe PBA nanospheres. Physicochemical and electrochemical results demonstrate that ligand exchange follows diffusion-controlled mechanism and the creatively developed electrocatalyst (C-Zn-ZIF-L@Zn-Fe PBA) with a multi-structure of nanospheres, dense carbon nanotubes and leaf-like carbon nanoplates exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and stability for neutral-pH ORR. The maximum power density of MFC with C-Zn-ZIF-L@Zn-Fe PBA cathode is 2511 +/- 69 mW m(-2) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency reaches to 90.17%, significantly outperforming the carbonization products of the other two single MOF. For practical application, two MFCs in series can as a power supplier to drive a digital watch for working 24 h constantly.

TI In Situ Exploring of the Origin of the Enhanced Oxygen Evolution
   Reaction Efficiency of Metal(Co/Fe)-Organic Framework Catalysts Via
   Postprocessing
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of vital importance for electrochemical energy conversion technologies. The use of metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts after postprocessing is an important method to optimize catalytic activity; however, little attention has been paid to the transformation of the electronic structure and coordinated ions under operando conditions. Here, we focus on a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with the formula Na2Co2+[Fe2+(CN)(6)]center dot nH(2)O after postprocessing at a temperature of 400 degrees C. The catalysts exhibit a significant improvement in the OER activity with an overpotential of 254 mV against 320 mV for the initial PBA at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Our ex situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results demonstrate that some of the high-spin Co2+ and low-spin Fe2+ ions of PBA exhibit exchange with N and C ligands. Our fast operando hard XAS study revealed a dynamic evolution process of the transformation of ligands from N(C) in the initial Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot nH(2)O to oxygen and the formation of pure low-spin Co3+ oxide and high-spin Fe3+ oxide after OER. The amorphous (Co,Fe)OOH chemical state was identified as the catalytically active state based on our operando X-ray spectroscopy results. The results of this study provide insights into a dynamic evolution process of MOFs after postprocessing and the formation of real active sites during electrocatalysis.

TI Metal-Organic framework incorporated luminescent PTCA combined with
   novel co-reactant accelerator for ultra-sensitive
   electrochemiluminescence detection of CA19-9
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are commonly used as electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminophores. However, PAHs are limited by the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect, which reduces ECL emission. Therefore, developing an ECL system from PAHs with efficient luminescence is a significant challenge. In this work, a two-ligand strategy was proposed to assemble 3, 4, 9, 10-perylenetetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) into zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF -8). The ACQ effect of PTCA was inhibited by participating in the formation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and a luminescent ZIF-8-PTC (Z8P) composite was obtained. Satisfactorily, conceptual experiments demonstrated that the significantly higher ECL efficiency of Z8P was achieved compared with PTCA monomers and aggregates. On the sensing substrate, a novel co-reactant accelerator (Au@MFNC) was used to achieve continuous catalysis of the persulfate (K 2 S 2 O 8 ) with the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as a template under the efficient synergistic effect of MoS 2 . Through the reversible transformation of the transition metal valence states, a sufficient amount of sulfate radicals (SO 4 center dot- ), again amplifying the ECL signal of Pd@Z8P. Under ideal conditions, the constructed dual-MOFs ECL immunosensor had a wide response range (1 x 10 -4 -1 x 10 2 U/mL) and a low limit of detection (LOD) (6 x 10 -5 U/mL), which provided an alternative method for CA19-9 ultrasensitive detection, and broadened a new idea for the development of high -performance luminescent MOFs.

TI Co3C-stabilized-CoFe heterostructure wrapped by bamboo-like N-doped
   carbon nanotubes for highly-efficient oxygen electrocatalysis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Bimetallic alloys have been showing unexpectedly high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline electrolytes. However, many fundamental questions regarding the ORR stability and poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of bimetallic alloys remain unresolved. Here, we prepare a cobalt carbide-stabilized CoFe alloy wrapped by hollow bamboo-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CoFe-Co3C@NCNTs) using bimetallic Prussian-blue-analogue and dicyandiamide as precursors. Interestingly, the spherical CoFe-Co3C heterojunctions are always encapsulated at one end of the tube. The as-marked CoFe-Co3C@NCNTs-20 catalyst exhibits an ultra-high ORR activity (half-wave potential of 0.934 V) and a relatively good OER activity (over -potential of 0.320 V), which are superior to Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. CoFe-Co3C@NCNTs-20 also shows excellent ORR/OER stabilities and potential difference between ORR and OER (0.616 V). Excellent activity and stability benefit from the synergies between CoFe-Co3C and NCNTs, while the hollow structure/conductive skeleton enhances the mass/charge transfers, respectively. The NCNTs coating greatly enhances the stability of the CoFe-Co3C heterojunctions to avoid the corrosion of active sites in alkaline media. Moreover, rechargeable zinc-air battery assembled with CoFe-Co3C@NCNTs-20 cathode shows high power-density (209.15 mW cm-2) and open-circuit voltage (1.505 V). It provides a new reference for promoting the development of bimetallic alloy-coupled transition metal carbide catalysts.

TI Co-doped Ni-PBA anchored on optimized ZIF-67-derived Co/N-doped hollow
   carbon framework for high-performance hybrid capacitive deionization
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are considered to be a promising electrode material for hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI) due to their open lattice structure, adjustable composition and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, the performance of PBAs in practical applications is limited by their low intrinsic conductivity and structural degradation. Herein, we demonstrate an advanced heterostructure CoNi-PBA@Co/N-HC by anchoring cobalt-doped nickel hexacyanoferrate (CoNi-PBA) on cobalt/nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon (Co/N-HC) derived from cobalt-based metal-organic frameworks (ZIF-67). Co/N-HC as the conductive growth framework of CoNi-PBA can not only promote the rapid charge transfer and efficient ion diffusion, but also mitigate the structural degradation of CoNi-PBA crystals during ion intercalation/deintercalation. Moreover, the doped Co in CoNi-PBA is derived from Co/N-HC, allowing the heterostructures to form more stable and tighter interconnections. Therefore, the optimal PBA@Co/N-HC300 electrode exhibits reduced equivalent series resistance (R-s 1.10 Omega < R-s (PBA) 1.41 Omega), enhanced ion diffusion rate (DNa+ 2.86 x 10(-16) > DNa+(PBA) 4.65 x 10(-18)) and exceptional electrochemical stability (99% capacitance retention, 500 times CV tests). Correspondingly, the HCDI cell PBA@Co/N-HC300//Co/N-HC demonstrates good Na+ removal capacity (33.37 mg<middle dot>g(-1)), excellent charge efficiency (83.65%), diminished energy consumption (0.657 kWh kg(-1)-NaCl) and improved cycle stability (90.8% capacity retention, 40 cycles).

TI K2.25Ni0.55Co0.37Fe(CN)6
   nanoparticle connected by cross-linked carbon nanotubes conductive
   skeletons for high-performance energy storage
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Prussian Blue (PB) coordination compound is a well-known ideal candidate for energy storage due to its tunable open framework structure. Especially transition metal hexacyanoferrate displays excellent performance in supercapacitor. In this paper, a facile one-step co-precipitation synthesis method is developed to prepare hybrid K2.25Ni0.55Co0.37Fe(CN)(6)/CNTs composite, aiming at increasing the electric conductivity of electrode material by introducing carbon nanotube conductive skeleton to the Cobale-Nickel hexacyanoferrate hybrid nanoparticles. The TEM image shows that K2.25Ni0.55Co0.37Fe(CN)(6) presents nanoparticles with a diameter about 20 nm, which are connected along the surface of carbon nanotube. Such special structure could facilitate the electric transportation between each nanoscale K2.25Ni0.55Co0.37Fe(CN)(6) particle, efficiently improving the utilization of active material. Considering the intrinsic abundant channels for ions insertion/extraction of nanoparticles and good conductivity of carbon nanotubes, our creative electrode is expected to display fantastic supercapacitor performance. The electrochemical data demonstrate that the K2.25Ni0.55Co0.37Fe(CN)(6)/CNTs electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 600 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and excellent rate performance of 90.4% when the current density ranged from 0.2 A g(-1) to 5 A g(-1). Furthermore, the K2.25Ni0.55Co0.37Fe(CN)(6)/CNTs composite achieves decent cycling stability with maintaining 94% of its initial specific capacitance after 2000 discharge/charge cycles. The excellent energy storage property offers a great promise as supercapacitor materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI NASICON-type Na3Fe2(PO4)3 as
   a low-cost and high-rate anode material for aqueous sodium-ion batteries
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Aqueous sodium-ion batteries are attractive battery alternatives for stationary energy storage due to their inherently low cost and high safety. The development of advanced electrode materials with excellent performance and low cost is crucial for the success of aqueous Na-ion batteries. Albeit the high capacity and stable cycling of the leading anode of NaTi2(PO4)(3), the high price of titanium element and the low Na-insertion potential close to the hydrogen evolution reaction may plague its application. Here we introduced a NASICON-type Na3Fe2(PO4)(3) as a promising anode alternative for aqueous Na-ion batteries. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy confirm its phase and atomic structure. Electrochemical characterization and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the reversible Na+ insertion in Na3Fe2(PO4)(3) due to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple, which renders a specific capacity of similar to 60 mAh g(-1) and excellent cycling of 1000 cycles at 10C rate. A Super high rate of 100C was also achieved for this anode with a capacity retention of 61% after 1000 cycles. In addition, the Na3Fe2(PO4)(3) anode is paired with a Prussian white analogue of Na2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] into a full cell, exhibiting promising cell performance and material sustainability. Our work underlines the importance of fabricating aqueous batteries on the basis of the Earth-abundant, cost-effective, and non-toxic elements.

SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The newly emerging rechargeable batteries beyond lithium-ion, including aqueous and nonaqueous Na-/K-/Zn-/Mg-/Ca-/Al-ion batteries, are rapidly developing toward large-scale energy storage application. The properties of electrode materials are determinant for electrochemical performance of the batteries. By virtue of the prominent features of low cost, non-toxicity, high voltage, and rich valence states, Mn-based electrode materials have attracted increasing attention.

TI Carbon-based derivatives from metal-organic frameworks as cathode hosts
   for Li-S batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S batteries) are promising candidates for the next generation high-energy rechargeable Li batteries due to their high theoretical specific capacity (1672 mAh g(-1)) and energy density (2500Wh kg(-1)). The commercialization of Li-S batteries is impeded by several key challenges at cathode side, e.g. the insulating nature of sulfur and discharged products (Li2S2 and Li2S2), the solubility of long-chain polysulfides and volume variation of sulfur cathode upon cycling. Recently, the carbonbased derivatives from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged talent in their utilization as cathode hosts for Li-S batteries. They are not only highly conductive and porous to enable the acceleration of Li+/e(-) transfer and accommodation of volumetric expansion of sulfur cathode during cycling, but also enriched by controllable chemical active sites to enable the adsorption of polysulfides and promotion of their conversion reaction kinetics. In this review, based on the types of MOFs (e.g. ZIF-8, ZIF-67, Prussian blue, Al-MOF, MOF-5, Cu-MOF, Ni-MOF), the synthetic methods, formation process and morphology, structural superiority of MOFs-derived carbon frameworks along with their electrochemical performance as cathode host in Li-S batteries are summarized and discussed.

TI Bias-free driven ion assisted photoelectrochemical system for
   sustainable wastewater treatment
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems have emerged as a prominent renewable energy-based technology for wastewater treatment, offering sustainable advantages such as eliminating dependence on fossil fuels or grid electricity compared to traditional electrochemical treatment methods. However, previous PEC systems often overlook the potential of ions present in wastewater as an alternative to externally applied bias voltage for enhancing carrier separation efficiency. Here we report a bias-free driven ion assisted photoelectrochemical (IAPEC) system by integration of an electron-ion acceptor cathode, which leverages its fast ion-electron coupling capability to significantly enhance the separation of electrons and holes at the photoanode. We demonstrate that Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) can serve as robust and reversible electron-ion acceptors that provide reaction sites for photoelectron coupling cations, thus driving the hole oxidation to produce strong oxidant free radicals at photoanode. Our IAPEC system exhibits superior degradation performance in wastewater containing chloride medium. This indicates that, in addition to the cations (e.g., Na+) accelerating the electron transfer rate, the presence of Cl- ions further enhance efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment. This work highlights the potential of utilizing abundant sodium chloride in seawater as a cost-effective additive for wastewater treatment, offering crucial insights into the use of local materials for effective, low-carbon, and sustainable treatment processes.

TI Electrosorption removal of cesium ions with a copper hexacyanoferrate
   electrode in a capacitive deionization (CDI) system
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a promising technique that can be applied to the removal ions of radioactive liquid waste. Carbon-based electrodes, which are mainly used in CDI systems, show limited characteristics due to their inferior selectivity and adsorption performance of target components present in feed water. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are proposed as an electrode material that operates by a reversible redox reaction, and provides a strategy to efficiently remove cesium (Cs) ions from aqueous solutions owing to its excellent ion adsorption capacity. In this research, copper hexcacyanoferrate (CuHCF) was utilized to improve the electrosorption performance in terms of Cs+ ions removal capacity and charging efficiency, and to achieve the selective electrosorption of Cs+ ion in cation mixtures. An outstanding electro-sorption capacity of 397 mg g(-1) (q(max)) and high selectivity were obtained at an optimum voltage of 1.4 V, and significant adsorption performance was maintained in the pH range of 1.0-5.6. The isotherms and adsorption kinetics employed to study the adsorption mechanism obey the Langmuir adsorption model and pseudo-first-order model, respectively. The Fe3+/Fe2+ and Cu2+/Cu+ redox couples are highly stable and reversible, providing outstanding cycling stability of CuHCF electrode. Our study demonstrates that the amount of Cs+ ions in an aqueous solution can be remarkably reduced by an electrochemically driven adsorption/desorption process using a CuHCF. Therefore, the proposed CDI system with CuHCF is a promising candidate for the efficient removal of cesium from wastewater and its large-scale application.

TI Modulating charge distribution of MIL@CuFe-Se by in-situ interface
   engineering for high performance supercapacitors
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Designing hybrid materials with ideal interfacial interactions derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) remains significant but challenging for the realm of energy storage. Herein, a controllable dual interface engineering concept is proposed with the objective of eliminating the non-ideal effects by augmenting the interfacial contact area, enhancing the efficacy of charge transfer across interfaces. Specifically, electrode materials with dual interface (FeSe/Cu2Se and MIL/CuFe-Se) were well-designed by co-precipitation and in-situ selenide, where the FeSe/Cu2Se heterogeneous interface by in-situ selenitisation of CuFe prussian blue analogue (PBA) increases the surface roughness of nanocubes, enlarging the dual interfacial contact area of MIL/CuFe-Se and eliminating non-interfacial effects. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the prepared electrodes exhibit both excellent rate performance and the ability to regulate interfacial charge transfer. Based on these advantages, the synthesised nanomaterials have a specific capacity of 913C/g at 1 A/g and a capacity retention of 86 % after 10,000 charge/discharge tests at 20 A/g. In addition, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) made of MIL@CuFe-Se (cathode) and activated carbon (AC, anode) has an energy density of 90 Wh kg(-1) at 800 W kg(-1) and a capacitance retention of 85.24% after 10,000 cycles at 20 A/g. Remarkably, two MIL@CuFe-Se//AC HSC in series can illuminate a light emitting diode (LED) lamp, implying the potential application prospects. This study aims to identify a viable method for advancing the development of high-performance supercapacitor applications.

TI Challenges and Opportunities for Large-Scale Electrode Processing for
   Sodium-Ion and Lithium-Ion Battery
SO BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS
AB Sodium-ion batteries are an emerging technology that is still at an early stage of development. The electrode processing for anode and cathode is expected to be similar to lithium-ion batteries (drop-in technology), yet a detailed comparison is not published. There are ongoing questions about the influence of the active materials on processing parameters such as slurry viscosity, coating thicknesses, drying times, and behavior during fast drying. Herein, the expected drying time for the same areal capacity of anodes (graphite vs. hard carbon) and cathodes (lithium iron phosphate vs. Prussian blue analogs) are compared based on respective specific capacities reported in the literature. Estimates are made for the materials' impact on production speed or dryer length. Within the experimental part, water-based slurries of the same composition are mixed using different active materials according to identical procedure and the viscosity is compared. When drying at a constant drying rate (0.75 g m-2 s-1), lithium iron phosphate electrodes with different areal capacities (1-3 mAh cm-2) are shown to have the highest adhesion. For high drying rates (3 g m-2 s-1) at constant areal capacity, especially the investigated electrodes based on hard carbon show that no binder migration occurs.
   LIB vs. SIB: This paper compares the expected drying time, production speed, dryer length based on specific capacities from the literature. For the same production speed, the drying time for SIB materials needs to be reduced. For a very high drying rate, especially the investigated hard carbon shows that no binder migration occurs.image

TI Smart configuration of cobalt hexacyanoferrate assembled on carbon fiber
   cloths for fast aqueous flexible sodium ion pseudocapacitor
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs) have the advantages of low cost, high safety and sustainable environmental friendliness. However, the key challenge for ARBs is the narrow electrochemical stability window of the water, undoubtedly leading to the low output voltage, the underachieved capacity and a low energy density. Prussian blues and their analogues have attracted great research interest for energy storage due to the advantages of facile synthesis, versatile categories and tunable three dimensional frameworks. Herein a flexible integrated potassium cobalt hexacyano ferrates (Co-HCF) on carbon fiber clothes (CFCs) were designed through a feasible route combining the controllable electrochemical deposition and the efficient co-precipitation process. The Co-HCF@CFCs demonstrate an excellent sodium ion storage with a high reversible capacity of 91 mAh g (1) at 1 A g (1) and 55 mAh g (1) at 10 A g (1) in aqueous electrolytes. The long cycling stability at the high current demonstrate the excellent structure stability of the Co-HCF@CFCs. Analysis on the rate Cyclic voltammograms (CV) profiles reveal the fast electrochemical kinetics with the capacitive controlled process, while galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests fast diffusion coefficient related with the sodium ions intercalation/deintercalation in the Co-HCF@CFCs. In addition, the flexible Co-CHF@CFCs also demonstrate excellent performance for quasi-solid-state ARBs even at the high bending angles. The high quality Co-HCF@CFCs with advantage of high rate capability and excellent reversible capacity make them a promising candidate for high performance ARBs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI Regulating core-shell interfacial interaction by oxygen bridging for
   enhancing electrochemical performance
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB It is crucial to design core-shell materials with interfacial interaction, which enhances their electrical conductivity, structural stability, and facilitates efficient charge transfer at the interface. In this study, two core-shell electrodes NC-O-PBA (NC: nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides, O-bridged core-shell materials) and LCCH@Ni(OH) 2 @PBA (LCCH: linear cobalt carbonate hydroxides, PBA: prussian blue analogs) were fabricated via interfacial contrast strategy to investigate the optimization function of oxygen at core-shell interface. Results show that as-prepared NC-O-PBA with high oxygen content creates an ideal condition for the formation of oxygen bridging. Moreover, the NC-O-PBA promotes a strong bond cooperation between core (NiCo-LDH) and shell (NiCo PBAs). The unit in PBAs can partly coordinate with the oxygen (from hydroxyl groups and interlayer ions in LDH), thus forming a strong interfacial coordination bonding between LDH and PBAs (Ni/Co(LDH)-O-CN (PBAs) or Ni/Co(LDH)-O-Ni/Co(PBAs)). Subsequently, NC-O-PBA electrode presents a high capacity of 1040.6 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 and a retention rate of 87.5% at 1500 cycles of 3 A g -1 , much higher than LCCH@Ni (OH) 2 @PBA (462.4 F g -1 and 41.26%). Finally, in -situ Raman results demonstrated the enhanced Faraday redox reaction of NC-O-PBA. This interfacial contrast strategy and oxygen-bridged approach provide a novel idea for the development of high-performance core-shell electrode materials and facilitate deeper insights into mechanism.

TI 2D confinement freestanding graphene oxide composite membranes with
   enriched oxygen vacancies for enhanced organic contaminants removal via
   peroxymonosulfate activation
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Introducing membrane filtration into advanced oxidation processes to decrease energy and cost consumption has been considered as a promising direction in environmental remediation. In this work, we firstly developed a kind of novel lawn-like Fe2O3@Co0.08Fe1.92@nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide@carbon nanotube composites (FeCo@GCTs) through in-situ pyrolysis of self-assembly of Prussian blue analogues and GO, followed through a vacuum-assisted filtration strategy to fabricate 2D confinement freestanding GO composite membrane. Electrochemical analysis and H2-TPR revealed the superiority of FeCo@GCTs as ideal electron acceptor, and this unique lawn-like structure concentrated active sites with a confined space and enriched oxygen vacancies that realized 98.5% (0.128 min-1) sulfamethoxazole degradation via peroxymonosulfate activation, and accelerated the reduction of Cr(VI). Owing to the increasing interlayer spacing of GO nanosheets, the permeation flux of FeCo@GCTs/GO membrane has not only been attained to 487.3 L center dot m- 2 center dot h-1 center dot bar- 1, which was more than 7.5-fold of GO membrane (64.6 L center dot m- 2 center dot h- 1 center dot bar- 1), but also achieved the synergistic membrane filtration and catalytic degradation of pollutants. Furthermore, scavenger experiments and EPR tests were conducted to confirm the active radicals, of which SO4 center dot- and 1O2 were responsible for SMX degradation. Therefore, these features demonstrated great potential for the fabricated 2D confinement catalytic membrane with enriched oxygen vacancies in wastewater purification.

TI Cobalt sulfide nanofilm-assembled cube as an efficient catalyst for
   activating monopersulfate to degrade UV filter,
   4,4′-dihydroxybenzophenone, in water
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB As hydroxylated benzophenones (HBPs) represent most typical UV filters and UV stabilizers, increasing release of HBPs into the aquatic environment has caused serious threats to the aquatic ecology. Among various HBPs, 4,4 ' Dihydroxybenzophenone (4HBP) receives growing attentions as an emerging contaminant due to its potential toxicity of endocrine disrupting effect. For establishing useful techniques to remove 4HBP from water, this study, as the first study, aims to develop cobalt sulfide as a heterogeneous catalyst to activate monopersulfate (MPS) for generating sulfate radical (SO4 center dot- ) to degrade 4HBP. Especially, a unique cubic assembly of cobalt sulfide nanofilms (CSNF) is developed through a simple sulfurization of Prussian Blue (PB) in the form of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 to transform this PB to CSNF. Such a resulting CSNF exhibits much higher catalytic activities than the pristine PB, and the reference catalyst, Co3O4, for activating MPS to degrade 4HBP in terms of degradation extents and kinetics. With very low dosages of CSNF = 50 mg/L and MPS = 100 mg/L, 5 mg/L of 4HBP could be fully eliminated in 15 min, validating that CSNF is a promising catalyst for activating MPS to 4HBP. Ea of 4HBP degradation by CSNF-activated MPS is also determined as 68 kJ/mol. The activation mechanism and degradation pathway of 4HBP degradation by CSNF-activated MPS is investigated using electro paramagnetic resonance and mass spectrometer, respectively, to further to provide insights into degradation behaviors for developing optimal sulfate-radical-based advanced oxidation processes of 4HBP degradation.

TI Degradation of atrazine by N-doped graphitic carbon encapsulated
   Nickel-iron alloy via heterogeneous activation of peroxymonosulfate
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Heterogeneous magnetic catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation that are used to degrade pollutants have attracted growing attention, and bimetallic alloy catalysts have excellent catalytic performance. In this study, nitrogen-doped graphite carbon encapsulated NiFe (NiFe@NC) alloy catalysts were synthesized using nickel-iron Prussian blue analog precursors to remove atrazine (ATZ) via the activation of PMS. The effects of various operating parameters (NiFe@NC dosage, PMS concentration, initial solution pH, and reaction temperature), and the effects of co-existing components were investigated. The synergistic catalysis of Ni and Fe gives NiFe@NC good catalytic properties. The NiFe@NC/PMS system achieved 100% removal of 10 mg L-1 ATZ was achieved in 30 min with an initial pH of 5.9; the TOF was 4.33 min -1, and the system exhibited resistance to interference from many co-existing substances. The graphite-carbon core-shell structure of NiFe@NC slowed down the leaching rate of metal ions and had good stability. Redox cycles in the system were achieved by facilitating the interaction between the transition metal and HSO5-, ensuring the continuous generation of reactive oxygen species. Ecotoxicity assessment showed that the toxicity level was significantly reduced after treatment. The total treatment cost of treating 1 m3 wastewater was lower than that of Fenton sludge catalyst. A continuous flow reactor was constructed to achieve continuous degradation of ATZ for long periods. This study expanded the application of PMS advanced oxidation technology by synthesizing an economical and recyclable magnetic catalyst and provided new insights for the removal of refractory organic matter.

TI A NiFe PBA/AuNPs nanocomposite sensitive immunosensor for
   electrochemical detection of PSA
SO ANALYTICAL METHODS
AB In this paper, a label-free electrochemical immunosensor for sensitive detection of prostate antigen (PSA) was developed based on a NiFe PBA/AuNPs composite. The prostate antigen antibody was immobilized and the immunosensor was constructed by using a glassy carbon electrode modified with a nanocomposite consisting of nickel-iron Prussian blue analog (NiFe PBA) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Due to the good biological affinity of AuNPs for biomolecules, as well as the porous nanostructure and regular shape of NiFe PBA, NiFe PBA/AuNPs nanocomposites significantly improve the electron transport rate, while achieving excellent performance for the sensor. Due to the interaction between the antibody and the antigen on the modified electrode, the current signal of the NiFe PBA itself is reduced due to the redox changes in Fe2+ and Fe3+, which can be determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Therefore, the monitoring of prostate antigen detection is realized. Under optimal experimental conditions, the immunosensor exhibited excellent detection performance with a dynamic response range from 0.5 pg mL-1 to 1000 pg mL-1 for the PSA concentration and a detection limit of 0.23 pg mL-1 (S/N = 3). In addition, the PSA aptasensor has good selectivity, high stability, and satisfactory reproducibility and has broad potential in clinical research and diagnostic applications.
   Due to the good biological affinity of AuNPs for biomolecules, as well as the porous nanostructure and regular shape of NiFe PBA, as well as the porous nanostructure and regular shape of NiFe PBA, NiFe PBA/AuNPs nanocomposites achieve sensitive sensor determination of PSA.

TI Aromatic Organic Small-Molecule Material with (020) Crystal Plane
   Activation for Wide-Temperature and 68000 Cycle Aqueous Calcium-Ion
   Batteries
SO ACS NANO
AB Calcium-ion batteries are an emerging energy storage device owing to the low redox potential of Ca2+/Ca and the naturally abundant reserves of the Ca element. However, the high charge density and large radius of Ca2+ lead to a low calcium storage capacity or unsatisfactory cycling performance for most electrode materials. Herein, we report the organic crystal 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) as an anode material for aqueous calcium-ion batteries (ACIBs) in a water-in-salt electrolyte. PTCDI delivers a high discharge capacity of 131.8 mAh g(-1), excellent rate performance (86.2 mAh g(-1)@10000 mA g(-1)), and an ultralong life of 68000 cycles (over 470 days) with a high capacity retention of 72.7%. The calcium storage mechanism of PTCDI is shown to be an enolization reaction by in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The activation mechanism of PTCDI microribbon splitting along the (020) crystal plane is studied by in situ X-ray diffraction, 3D tomography reconstruction technologies, and ex situ transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the Ca2+ storage sites and diffusion pathways of PTCDI are studied by density functional theory calculations. Finally, by matching a high-voltage Prussian blue analogue cathode, the assembled aqueous calcium-ion full cells exhibit excellent wide-temperature operating capability (-20 to +50 degrees C) and an ultralong life of 30000 cycles. Further, an aqueous calcium-ion pouch cell is constructed and exhibits a long lifetime of over 500 cycles.

TI Design of double-shelled NiS-FeS@NC hollow nanocubes for
   high-performance sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Mixed metal sulfides (MMSs) are highly noticeable as prospective materials for sodium storage due to their prominent electrochemical reversibility and excellent redox activity. Nevertheless, the fast capacity decay and poor rate capability hinder their application in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile template method, using Prussian blue analogue as the precursor, was employed to fabricate the double-shelled hollow structure with nitrogen (N)-doped carbon layer coated on the outer shell of NiS-FeS hollow nanocubes (NiS-FeS@NC). Specifically, the NiS-FeS@NC composite provides a glorious reversible capacity (395.8 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 1.0 A g-1) and superior rate capability (322.2 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1) when employed as electrode material for SIBs. In addition, the designed NiS-FeS@NC= |Na3V2(PO4)2 @C full battery can maintain an excellent reversible capacity (68.7 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 1.0 A g-1) as well as robust cycling stability. The improvement of the sodium storage performance can be mainly attributed to the synergistic coupling of the N-doped carbon coating layer and the hollow nanostructure, which can effectively maintain the integrity of the nanocube structure and accelerate the transportation of electrons/ ions, thus contributing to improving the electrochemical sodium storage performance. Importantly, the unique modification strategy reported in this paper, combining with the mechanism and kinetics revealing, is expected to provide insights for facilitating high-performance electrodes for SIBs.

TI Decoupling Interfacial Kinetics Realizes 5C Fast Charging of
   Potassium-Ion Batteries Using Graphite Anode
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Improving interfacial kinetics is the key to realizing extreme fast charging (XFC) of graphite-based potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The electrolyte engineering is commonly used for solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) design. However, this strategy adjusts both ion solvation structure and (de)solvation kinetics simultaneously, thus making it difficult to explicitly reveal the linkage between SEI properties and interfacial kinetics. Herein, the content of inorganic species in preformed SEI on graphite surface is precisely regulated and uncovered its critical role in improving the interfacial kinetics. The charge transfer kinetics on graphite/electrolyte interphase is found to be the rate limitation step upon XFC. Meanwhile, the increased inorganic species in SEI plays a decisive role in optimizing the charge transfer rather than the kinetics of naked K+ crossing SEI. Through unlocking the anodic charge transfer limitation with ultra-inorganic rich SEI, the graphite//Prussian blue analogs full cells achieve a superior XFC ability (13 min charge to 80%) with a specific capacity of 103 mAh g-1 at 5 C. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the relationship between SEI properties and interfacial kinetics during XFC, which enables the rational design of SEI chemistry for fast-charging PIBs.
   This study has revealed the charge transfer kinetics at the graphite/electrolyte interface is the rate-limiting step during extremely fast charging. By constructing an inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interface on graphite, successful 5 C fast charging of potassium full cells is achieved by the improved anodic charge transfer kinetics, which effectively guides the rational design of fast rechargeable potassium-ion batteries. image

TI EBuilding Zn-Fe bimetal selenides heterostructures caged in
   nitrogen-doped carbon cubic for lithium and sodium ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Due to the application of lithium-ion batteries in various convenient electronic devices and electric vehicles, their related study has attracted many researchers' interests. However, the practical application is limited by their fast capacity attenuation, low reversibility and slow charge rate. Sodium-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention in energy storage systems due to similar energy storage mechanisms with lithium-ion batteries and extensive sodium resources on earth. In recent years, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) and transition metal selenides have attracted many researchers' attention due to their unique structures and high theoretical capacities and have been considered to be the most potential anode materials. However, they have the disadvantages of rapid volume expansion and capacity degradation in the process of lithium insertion/extraction. Here, ZnSe-Fe3Se4 heterostructures coated with N-doped carbon (ZnSe-Fe3Se4@NC) was successfully designed by one-step selenization of Zn-Fe PBA. This unique 3D hierarchical heterostructures can provide a stable environment for lithium ions and sodium ions transportation and shortens the transmission path, which greatly improves the performance of lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. The Zn-Fe-Se@NC displays a discharge capacity of 1111.30 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1) for lithium-ion batteries and 368 mA h g(-1) after 60 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1) for sodium-ion batteries.

TI Cooperative Effects Drive Water Oxidation Catalysis in Cobalt
   Electrocatalysts through the Destabilization of Intermediates
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB A barrier to understanding the factors driving catalysis in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is understanding multiple overlapping redox transitions in the OER catalysts. The complexity of these transitions obscure the relationship between the coverage of adsorbates and OER kinetics, leading to an experimental challenge in measuring activity descriptors, such as binding energies, as well as adsorbate interactions, which may destabilize intermediates and modulate their binding energies. Herein, we utilize a newly designed optical spectroelectrochemistry system to measure these phenomena in order to contrast the behavior of two electrocatalysts, cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) and cobalt-iron hexacyanoferrate (cobalt-iron Prussian blue, CoFe-PB). Three distinct optical spectra are observed in each catalyst, corresponding to three separate redox transitions, the last of which we show to be active for the OER using time-resolved spectroscopy and electrochemical mass spectroscopy. By combining predictions from density functional theory with parameters obtained from electroadsorption isotherms, we demonstrate that a destabilization of catalytic intermediates occurs with increasing coverage. In CoOOH, a strong (similar to 0.34 eV/monolayer) destabilization of a strongly bound catalytic intermediate is observed, leading to a potential offset between the accumulation of the intermediate and measurable O-2 evolution. We contrast these data to CoFe-PB, where catalytic intermediate generation and O-2 evolution onset coincide due to weaker binding and destabilization (similar to 0.19 eV/monolayer). By considering a correlation between activation energy and binding strength, we suggest that such adsorbate driven destabilization may account for a significant fraction of the observed OER catalytic activity in both materials. Finally, we disentangle the effects of adsorbate interactions on state coverages and kinetics to show how adsorbate interactions determine the observed Tafel slopes. Crucially, the case of CoFe-PB shows that, even where interactions are weaker, adsorption remains non-Nernstian, which strongly influences the observed Tafel slope.

TI Self-supported ternary Ni-Fe-P nanosheets derived from metal-organic
   frameworks as efficient overall water splitting electrocatalysts
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Developing cost-effective, highly-efficient and stable electrocatalysts is of significance to replace noble metal based materials for overall water electrolysis. In this paper, nickel-iron phosphide nanosheets on nickel foam (Ni-Fe-P/NF) were synthesized through in-situ chemical etching and subsequently phosphating treatment. The Ni foam utilized in this work not only serves as conductive substrate and metal current collector, but also as nickel source for the growth of metal organic frameworks (i.e. Prussian blue analogue pyramids), which were then converted to Ni-Fe-P nanosheets via phosphating. Benefiting from the unique nanostructure, Fe incorporation, and the high conductivity of nickel foam, the resulting Ni-Fe-P/NF could be used as self-supported and binder-free working electrode with superior overall electrochemical water splitting performance. Electrochemical measurement demonstrates that the Ni-Fe-P/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities with overpotentials of 98 mV for HER and 168 mV for OER to deliver current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the Ni-Fe-P/NF catalyst was also employed as both as anode and cathode for overall water electrolysis, and shows extraordinary activities with low voltage of only 1.486 V to yield 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding cycling stability with negligible voltage elevation after chronopotentiometry determination for 200 h. This work highlights that direct growth of metal organic frameworks on conductive substrates is an effective method to explore electrocatalysts for multifunctional electrochemical applications.

TI Unveiling a bimetallic FeCo-coupled MoS2 composite for
   enhanced energy storage
SO NANOSCALE
AB Sodium and potassium-ion batteries are promising for energy storage owing to their source abundance and low cost; however, most active materials still suffer from sluggish kinetics, huge volume variations, and poor conductivity and cycle stability. It remains a great challenge to explore appropriate electrode materials for scaled practical applications. Herein, mesoporous FeCo-incorporated MoS2 nanosheets encapsulated into a porous carbon framework (FeCo@C@MoS2) are smartly designed, artistically fabricated and evaluated for sodium and potassium storage. The FeCo@C@MoS2 electrode displays high reversible capacities of 380 mA h g(-1) and 147 mA h g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) for sodium and potassium storage, respectively. FeCo derived from a Prussian blue analogue promotes fast reaction kinetics of Na+/K+ transport, introduces the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase layer (SEI) in both the interior and exterior of the cube-like porous nanostructure and controls the Na+/K+ fluxes, suppressing the growth of metal dendrites. The porous carbon framework with large interstitial voids can effectively buffer volume variations and mitigate mechanical stress, contributing significantly to alleviate strain intensification on the surface layer between MoS2 and FeCo during repeated plating/stripping processes. Density functional theoretical calculations (DFT) further confirm that the synthesized nanostructure shows an intensified electron state, elevated anti-stress ability, high-quality SEI film and preferable Na+/K+ adsorption energies. This in-depth investigation of the electrochemical performance and the extended energy storage mechanism based on metal alloy/sulfide nanostructures for sodium and potassium storage provides guidance for the smart design of heterojunctions for remarkable energy storage.

TI Cobalt-zinc carbides embedded in N-doped porous carbon nanospheres as
   polysulfide mediators for efficient lithium-sulfur batteries
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Developing high-efficiency interlayer catalysts is a promising tactic for improving the cycling performance of rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, using the Prussian blue analogue as the precursor, cobalt-zinc carbide nanocrystal-embedded N-doped porous carbon (Co3ZnC@NC) is synthesized via simple post-carbonization. The obtained Co3ZnC@NC nanospheres exhibit a robust core-shell structure showing good conductivity, high porosity and available metal active sites, favoring the interfacial charge transfer and the electron transport upon electrochemical reactions. The results demonstrate that the Co3ZnC@NC catalyst is quite suitable for boosting the adsorption and redox conversion kinetics of soluble polysulfides. When acting as the separator interlayer, Co3ZnC@NC contributes to improved Li-S batteries with a high discharge specific capacity of 1659.8 mA h g-1 at 0.1C and superior cycling stability of over 250 cycles at 1.0C (high capacity retention of 84.1% after 100 cycles at 0.5C). Furthermore, the Co3ZnC@NC-based battery can maintain a high discharge capacity of 734.0 mA h g-1 at 5.0C, along with delivering a stable reversible capacity of 805.4 mA h g-1 (similar to 5 mA h cm-2) after 50 cycles even under a high sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm-2. This study affords a viable way to construct highly dispersed bimetal/carbon composites for efficient catalysts and renewable energy devices.
   Developing high-efficiency interlayer catalysts is a promising tactic for improving the cycling performance of rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.

TI Heterostructure Interface Construction of Cobalt/Nickle Diselenides
   Hybridized with sp2-sp3 Bonded Carbon to Boost Internal/External Sodium
   and Potassium Storage Dynamics
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Metal selenides exhibit great potential in energy storage systems owing to their diversified species, large interlayer spaces, and high theoretical specific capacity according to multiple ion-storage behaviors. In this work, heterostructured CoSe2/ NiSe2 coupled with sp3 bonded N-doped carbon coating layers and interconnected with sp2 bonded carbon nanotubes is synthesized through a room-temperature wet-chemistry approach and a selenization route with Co-Ni Prussian blue analogues as the precursor. The hybrid exhibits enhanced energy storage properties when utilized as an anode material for sodium-and potassium-ion batteries. The excellent performance of the hybrid can be indexed to the delicately design of the CoSe2/NiSe2 heterostructure and the hybridization of it with sp2 and sp3 bonded carbonaceous materials synchronously. Experimental and theoretical calculation results demonstrate the heterostructure is constructed to acquire charge transfer driving forces to boost internal reaction dynamics. And there is a combination of the dual advantages of sp3 and sp2 bonded carbon, possessing not only the exceptional mechanics buffer capability of N-doped carbon coating layers but also the excellent electrical characteristics of carbon nanotubes to promote external reaction dynamics. In addition, to elucidate the differential sodium/potassium storage capability of the hybrid, theoretical calculations are further performed to indagate the adsorption energy of sodium and potassium on the CoSe2/NiSe2 heterointerface by establishing five Na/K adsorption sites. The research provides an effective strategy for the melioration of internal/external reaction dynamics to deliver ions durably and efficiently in energy storage regions.

TI Tunable electronic coupling of cobalt sulfide/carbon composites for
   optimizing oxygen evolution reaction activity
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Hybrid nanocomposites consisting of non-precious transition-metal oxides/chalcogenides and a carbon matrix are of great interest for future applications in sustainable energy storage and conversion systems owing to their unique chemical and physical properties as well as the synergism. However, the construction of nanocomposites with tunable coupling effects to realize synergetic effects and optimal performance remains challenging. Herein, we develop a facile strategy for the synthesis of cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) nanoparticles encapsulated in the carbon matrix from a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) through a simultaneous sulfidation and carbonization process. With an increase in the degree of carbonization, the coordinated organic ligands (C  N) liberated from the PBA can be evolved as N-doped amorphous carbon (N-AC), N-doped graphitic carbon (N-GC) and N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs), respectively, generating the tunable electronic coupling between the Co9S8 and the carbon matrix. As an example, we show that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of such nanocomposites can be made comparable to the state-of-the-art catalytic properties of precious catalysts by optimizing the electronic coupling between the components so that electron injection from the N-doped carbon to the catalytically active site is greatly facilitated. Furthermore, the in situ formation of cobalt hydroxides on the surface of Co9S8 is also confirmed during the OER process, which might induce the interfacial effect, i.e. electron interplay, thus altering the OER catalytic activity. The current work provides new insights into the rational design of advanced hybrid nanocomposites for energy and environmental applications.
