TI Real-time neurochemical sensing of hydrogen peroxide production in brain
   tissue using advanced nanostructured Au microelectrodes functionalized
   with a ruthenium purple film
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Real-time monitoring of H2O2 is essential for understanding its role in neurological physio(path)ology. In this study, we developed an advanced electrochemical sensor utilizing nanostructured gold wire microelectrodes functionalized with a Ruthenium Purple (RP) film, a polynuclear transition metal hexacyanoferrate analog of the prototypical Prussian Blue (PB). The RP film exhibits enhanced stability in neutral buffer solutions and reduced interference from biologically relevant cations such as Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. By integrating gold nanoparticles onto a nanoporous gold surface, we significantly increased the electroactive surface area of the microwire (rho=26.1 f 10.2). The electrodeposition of a thin RP film (4.23 f 1.2 nm) resulted in a highly selective H2O2 sensor, operating at an optimal working potential of -0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl, with a linear detection range of 0.5-500 mu M, sensitivity of 1.18 f 0.37 mu A mu M-1 cm-2, and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 66.6 f 34.9 nM. Adding a Nafion (R) layer enhanced the sensor's operational stability, maintaining optimal performance over three hours under physiological conditions of pH and ion concentration. We validated the sensor's capability to monitor transient changes in H2O2 concentration in brain tissue by assessing its response to exogenously applied H2O2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that glutamate receptor activation in hippocampal slices induces a rapid and transient increase in extracellular H2O2 levels, underscoring the sensor's potential for studying oxidative stress in neurobiological contexts.

TI A(CoFe)(S2)2/CoFe heterostructure constructed in
   S, N co-doped carbon nanotubes as an efficient oxygen electrocatalyst
   for zinc-air battery
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Transition metal alloys can exhibit synergistic intermetallic effects to obtain high activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, due to the insufficient stability of active sites in alkaline electrolytes, conventional alloy catalysts still do not meet practical needs. Herein, by using polypyrrole tubes and cobalt-iron (CoFe) Prussian blue analogs as precursors, CoFe sulfides is in-situ formed on CoFe alloys to construct (CoFe)(S-2)(2)/CoFe heterostructure in sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) co-doped carbon nanotubes (CoFe@NCNTs-nS) via a low-temperature sulfidation strategy. The as-marked CoFe@NCNTs-12.5S exhibits a comparable ORR activity (half-wave potential of 0.901 V) to Pt/C (0.903 V) and a superior OER activity (overpotential of 272 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) to RuO2 (299 mV). CoFe@NCNTs-12.5S also exhibits ultralow charge transfer resistances (ORR-6.36 Omega and OER-0.21 Omega) and an excellent potential difference of 0.617 V. The sulfidation-induced (CoFe)(S-2)(2)/CoFe heterojunctions can accelerate interfacial charge transfer process. Tubular structure not only disperses the (CoFe)(S-2)(2)/CoFe heterostructure, but also reduces the corrosion of active-sites to enhance catalysis stability. Zinc-air battery with CoFe@NCNTs-12.5S achieves a high specific capacity (718.1 mAh g(-1)), maintaining a voltage gap of 0.957 V after 400 h. This work reveals the potential of interface engineering for boosting ORR/OER activities of alloys via in-situ heterogenization.

TI Anti-catalytic and zincophilic layers integrated zinc anode towards
   efficient aqueous batteries for ultra-long cycling stability
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Aqueous zinc-based battery is usually plagued by serious dendrites and side reactions including Zn corrosion and water decomposition on the anode. To address the drawbacks, constructing coating layers with high conductivity and anti-catalytic effects on hydrogen evolution reaction has been considered as an efficient strategy. Herein, cheap and abundant two-dimensional (2D) conductive graphite (KS-6) coating layer with high electronic conductivity (similar to 10(6) S.m(-1)) could directly form strong bonding with Zn foil due to high zincophilicity, which correspondingly protects Zn metal from liquid electrolyte to inhibit parasitic hydrogen evolution and guide uniform Zn electrodeposition during cycling. The KS-6 layer owns a profitable charge redistribution effect to endow Zn anode with a lower nucleation energy barrier and a more uniformly distributed electric field compared with bare Zn. Therefore, such integrated Zn anode exhibits low voltage hysteresis (similar to 38 mV) and excellent cycling stability with dendrite-free behaviors (1 mA.cm(-2) and 2 mA.cm(-2)) over 2,000 h, far outperforming many reported Zn metal anodes in aqueous systems. Encouragingly, in light of the superior Zn@KS-6 anode, VNOx powders and Prussian blue analogs Mn2Fe(CN)(6) are applied as the cathode materials to assemble full batteries, which show remarkable cycling stabilities and high Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) over 200 cycles with capacity retention of 81.5% for VNOx//Zn@KS-6 battery and over 400 cycles with capacity retention of 94.6% for Mn2Fe(CN)(6)//Zn@KS-6 battery, respectively.

Therefore, this review will provide a comprehensive summary of the latest progress in various electrode materials adopted in the current ZIBs and ZABs along with corresponding mechanisms. Specifically, Mn- and V-containing cathode materials for ZIBs and associated reaction mechanisms will be thoroughly discussed, and emerging cathodes such as Prussian blue analogues, NASICON-type nanostructures and organic compounds will be presented. In terms of ZABs, this review will discuss three major types of electrocatalysts, including noble metals, heteroatom-doped carbons and transition metal oxides/sulphides/phosphides/nitrides. In addition, as a critical factor in the performance of Zn-based batteries, challenges encountered by the current Zn anodes and strategies developed to tackle these issues will be discussed as well. Finally, a short summary including the current progress and future perspectives of ZIBs and ZABs will be provided. Graphical Abstract

TI Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2 nanocubes boost the
   catalytic activity of Pt for electrochemical hydrogen evolution
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) are crucial and highly desired in the sustainable energy field. Despite tremendous efforts on the development of alternative catalysts, platinum (Pt) is still the most efficient catalyst for HERs. Nevertheless, it remains a great challenge to output sufficient catalytic activity with a low Pt loading. In this research, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) of nickel hexacyanoferrate (Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)) nanocubes were used as the active substrate to enhance the HER activity of Pt by fabricating a Pt-Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) interface. The Ni species of Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) play key roles in contributing to the water dissociation and improving the HER kinetics, as well as helping to maintain the catalytic activity of Pt during a long-term durability test in both acidic and alkaline media. As a result, the new Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)/Pt hybrid catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic property for HERs in both sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and potassium hydroxide with a low Pt loading of only 4.0%. Impressively, a low overpotential of 59 mV is achieved at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in H2SO4, and a high mass current density of 3.75 mA g Pt-1 is obtained at an overpotential of 70 mV, which outperforms currently reported Pt-based catalysts in acid electrolyte. It is believed that this work will inspire the design of PBA-based hybrid nanomaterials with improved or new functionalities for energy conversion and catalysis applications.

TI Nonflammable Phosphate-Based Electrolyte for Safe and Stable Potassium
   Batteries Enabled by Optimized Solvation Effect
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Current potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are limited in safety and lifetime owing to the lack of suitable electrolyte solutions. To address these issues, herein, we report an innovative non-flammable electrolyte design strategy that leverages an optimal moderate solvation phosphate-based solvent which strikes a balance between solvation capability and salt dissociation ability, leading to superior electrochemical performance. The formulated electrolyte simultaneously exhibits the advantages of low salt concentration (only 0.6 M), low viscosity, high ionic conductivity, high oxidative stability, and safety. Our electrolyte also promotes the formation of self-limiting inorganic-rich interphases at the anode surface, alongside robust cathode-electrolyte interphase on iron-based Prussian blue analogues, mitigating electrode/electrolyte side reactions and preventing Fe dissolution. Notably, the PIBs employing our electrolyte exhibit exceptional durability, with 80 % capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at high-voltage of 4.2 V in a coin cell. Impressively, in a larger scale pouch cell, it maintains over 81 % of its initial capacity after 1,400 cycles at 1 C-rate with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6 %. This work represents a significant advancement toward the realization of safe, sustainable, and high-performance PIBs.
   The safety and lifespan of energy storage devices have always been a challenge for the development of batteries, and potassium-ion batteries are no exception. In this work, we present an advanced non-flammable electrolyte achieved by carefully manipulating the solvation capability of a family of phosphate solvents. The customized electrolyte enables safe and stable cycling of potassium-ion batteries. image

TI Constructing crystalline/amorphous heterojunction in FeCo@C nanoboxes
   for enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption
SO CARBON
AB The advanced electromagnetic applications urgently require high performance absorbers with sophisticated structural and compositional design. An effective strategy is to construct a three-dimensional hollow structure, with enhanced electromagnetic wave dissipation capacity over a wide effective absorption bandwidth. However, a major challenge remains due to a single loss mechanism system derived from the conventional hollow nanobox structure, which seriously causes impedance mismatch and lack of polarization centers. Herein, we innovatively construct novel hollow structure FeCo@C (CMFC) with crystalline/amorphous heterojunction FeCo/C particles by cation exchange method, thereby achieving enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption. The CMFC achieves Ku-band effective absorption with a reflection loss of-50.57 dB and effective absorption bandwidth of 5.35 GHz at 1.8 mm. The CMFC exhibits excellent microwave absorption performance due to the presence of crystalline/ amorphous FeCo/C heterojunction, which is attributed to the balanced dielectric loss and optimized impedance matching characteristics. CST simulations demonstrate that the CMFC has a radar scattering interface reduction value as high as 26.12 dBm (Wu et al., 2023) [2] at a scattering angle of 0 degrees. This work provides new ideas for the rational design of hollow nanostructures with heterojunction particles for efficient microwave absorption.

TI Embedded, micro-interdigitated flow fields in high areal-loading
   intercalation electrodes towards seawater desalination and beyond
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Faradaic deionization (FDI) is a promising technology for energy-efficient water desalination using porous electrodes containing redox-active materials. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time the capability of a symmetric FDI flow cell to produce freshwater (<17.1 mM NaCl) from concentrated brackish water (118 mM), to produce effluent near freshwater salinity (19.1 mM) from influent with seawater-level salinity (496 mM), and to reduce the salinity of hypersaline brine from 781 mM to 227 mM. These remarkable salt-removal levels were enabled by using flow-through electrodes with high areal-loading of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) Prussian Blue analogue intercalation material. The pumping energy consumption due to flow-through electrodes was mitigated by embedding an interdigitated array of <100 mu m wide channels in the electrodes using laser micromachining. The micron-scale dimensions of the resulting embedded, micro-interdigitated flow fields (e mu-IDFFs) facilitate flow-through electrodes with high apparent permeability while minimizing active-material loss. Our modeling shows that these e mu-IDFFs are more suitable for our intercalation electrodes because they have >100x lower permeability compared to common redox-flow battery electrodes, for which millimetric flow-channel widths were used exclusively in the past. Total desalination thermodynamic energy efficiency (TEE) was improved by more than ten-fold relative to unpatterned electrodes: 40.0% TEE for brackish water, 11.7% TEE for hypersaline brine, and 7.4% TEE for seawater-salinity feeds. Water transport between diluate and brine streams and charge efficiency losses resulting from (electro)chemical effects are implicated as limiting energy efficiency and water recovery, motivating their investigation for enhancing future FDI performance.

TI Catalytic activity atlas of ternary Co-Fe-V metal oxides for the oxygen
   evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial limiting factor in many renewable energy conversion and storage devices. Multi-metal oxides have been explored as efficient electrocatalysts for the OER; however, the ideal elemental composition for multi-metal oxides is unknown. We first performed density functional theory calculations, which predicted that Co oxyhydroxides doped with Fe and V have excellent catalytic activity. We synthesized a series of amorphous Co-Fe-V ternary metal oxides with a precisely controlled metal molar composition (denoted as CoaFebVcOx, wherea+b+c= 10), uniformly distributed elements and identical morphologies by using Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as novel metal precursors. A systematic investigation was carried out to establish correlations between the elemental compositions and the OER activity for CoaFebVcOx, resulting in a comprehensive catalytic activity atlas of ternary Co-Fe-V metal oxides for the OER, which can serve as a roadmap for electrocatalyst development. In particular, Co(3)Fe(4)V(3)O(x)with an elemental composition of Co : Fe : V = 3 : 4 : 3 shows the best performance, with an overpotential of merely 249 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), outperforming a commercial IrO(x)catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals strong electronic synergies among the metal cations in CoaFebVcOx. The V and Fe doping can affect the electronic structure of Co to yield nearly optimal adsorption energies for OER intermediates, giving rise to the superior activity. Furthermore, composition-tuneable and uniform PBAs may serve as versatile and efficient metal precursors to produce many more multi-metal oxides for various renewable energy applications.

TI In-situ immobilization of Fe PBA in the zeolite structure for efficient
   degradation of benzalkonium chloride: Towards compressed reaction site
   loss and promoted PMS utilization
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Advanced oxidation processes based on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the removal of quaternary ammonium compounds have challenges, including high metal leaching and excessive oxidant consumption, which limit their practical application. In this work, Fe atoms were firstly intercalated into the structure of the zeolite through ion exchange and then transformed into Fe prussian blue analog (Fe PBA) in-situ through coprecipitation followed by a calcination process. Through immobilizing the reactive catalytic center to a specific site, the leaching rate of Fe was compressed to about 0.25 mg center dot L-1, accounting for only 6 % of the Fe PBA without zeolite immobilization. The incorporation of zeolite has triggered increased hydrophilicity while retaining the negatively charged property of Fe PBA, implying enhanced dispersity of the catalyst in the aqueous environment and attraction towards benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and PMS molecules. Intuitively, the reactive oxidative species (ROS) generated through PMS activation require less diffusion distance to encounter BAC molecules, as they are confined within the microenvironment around the surface due to this weak electrostatic attraction. Therefore, an increase in ROS utilization efficiency was observed with a significant reduction in PMS dosage. Remarkably, 99.83 % of BAC (10 mg center dot L-1) was eliminated within 60 min with only 0.5 mM PMS, which is much lower than the reported 5-100 mM PMS. More importantly, the post-annealing brought an increased amount of graphitic carbon, which enhanced singlet oxygen production and further improved the degradation efficiency of BAC molecules due to its unique selectivity. This study presents a feasible strategy for simultaneously enhancing PMS utilization and reducing metal ion leaching.

TI MOF-derived double-shelled Fe(OH)3@NiCo-LDH hollow cubes and
   their efficient adsorption for anionic organic pollutant
SO JOURNAL OF POROUS MATERIALS
AB Combination of multiple components with hollow architectures and complex multi-shelled structures may result in synergistically enhancing the performance and application of composite materials. Herein, we have demonstrated a metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived approach toward the large-scale and facile synthesis of hierarchical double-shelled Fe(OH)(3)@NiCo-layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDH) hollow cubes with the inner Fe(OH)(3) and outer NiCo-LDH layers. The synthetic procedures involved the oriented deposition of NiCo-LDH shell on the surface of Prussian blue (PB) cubes in the refluxing process and a subsequent chemical etching of PB template with NaOH solution at room temperature. The obtained samples have been systematically characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, XRD, XPS and N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis. Benefiting from the structural merits including high specific surface area, abundant diffusion passage and unique hierarchical hollow structures, the derived double-shelled Fe(OH)(3)@NiCo-LDH hollow cubes exhibited significant adsorption capacity toward Congo red and the maximum adsorption capacity can reach up to 658.52 mg/g at 25 degrees C. Langmuir isotherm model provided a better description for the adsorption isotherms, and pseudo-second-order kinetic model can well represent the adsorption kinetics. Moreover, the removal efficiency of Fe(OH)(3)@NiCo-LDH hollow cubes can still reach 73.1% for Congo red after recycling five times, indicating a good recovery efficiency. Furthermore, the possible adsorption mechanism of the Fe(OH)(3)/NiCo-LDH composite involved ions exchange, hydrogen bonding interaction and electrostatic attraction. Therefore, the double-shelled Fe(OH)(3)@NiCo-LDH hollow cubes have the potential application to absorb and remove anionic organic dye from wastewater solution in view of their facile synthesis method and excellent adsorption performance.

TI Electron transfer in cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles promoted by
   reverse microemulsions prepared with Cetyltrimethylammonium surfactants
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Reverse microemulsions (RME) formed with the systems CTAX + pentanol/hexane/water (where X = Br-, Cl- or p-toluensulfonate) were used as synthesis media of cobalt hexacyanofarrate nanoparticles (CoHCF-NP). In this work, the effect that these RME have on the final structure of the CoHCF-NP is presented. Starting with a reaction between the reactant ions (RI) Co2+ and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), CoHCF-NP with the expected structure based on the chain Fe-III-CN-Co-II can be obtained. By changing variables that defines the RME, it is possible to promote an electron transfer inside the CoHCF-NP to change the structure from Fe-III-CN-Co-II to Fe-II-CN-Co-II. Variables as water concentration, distribution of the RI in the RME droplets, the surfactant counterion, and the concentration ratio of the RI showed a remarkable effect on the CoHCF-NP. CoHCF-NP in which the chain Fe-III-CN-Co-II predominates in the structure can be synthesized using RME formed with: i) CTAB at high RI and water concentration; ii) CTAT, when the concentration of RI is higher than 0.02 M. On the other hand, CoHCF-NP with predominance of Fe-II-CN-Co-II can be synthesized using RME formed with: i) CTAB at low RI and water concentration; ii) CTAC, regardless the RI and water concentrations. This information is summarized in a concentration diagram where it is possible to predict the structure of the CoHCF-NP. To the best of our knowledge, this type of diagrams has not been constructed before for any of the Prussian blue analogues synthesized in RME.

TI Selective capture of ammonium ions from municipal wastewater treatment
   plant effluent with a nickel hexacyanoferrate electrode
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Currently, intercalation materials such as Prussian blue analogs have attracted considerable attention in water treatment applications due to their excellent size-based selectivity toward cations. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using a nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) electrode for selective NH4+ capture from effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. To assess the competitive intercalation between NH4+ and other common cations (Na+, Ca2+), a NiHCF//activated carbon (AC) hybrid capacitive deionization (CDI) cell was established to treat mixed-salt solutions. The results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis showed a higher current response of the NiHCF electrode toward NH4+ ions than toward Na+ and Ca2+ ions. In a single-salt solution with NH4+, the optimized operating voltage of the hybrid CDI cell was 0.8 V, with a higher salt adsorption capacity (51.2 mg/g) than those obtained at other voltages (0.1, 0.4, 1.2 V). In a multisalt solution containing NH4+, Na+, and Ca2+ ions, the selectivity coefficients of NH4+/Ca2+ and NH4+/Na+ were 9.5 and 4.9, respectively. The feasibility of selective NH4+ capture using the NiHCF electrode in a hybrid CDI cell was demonstrated by treating the effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The intercalation preference of the NiHCF electrode with the WWTP effluent was NH4+>K+>Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+, and NH4+ showed the highest salt adsorption capacity among the cations during consecutive cycles. Our results revealed that cations with smaller hydrated radii and lower (de)hydration energies were more favorably intercalated by the NiHCF electrode. The results provide important knowledge regarding the use of intercalation-type electrodes for selective nutrient removal and recovery from wastewater.

TI Improved zinc-ion storage performance of the metal-free organic anode by
   the effect of binder
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) using zinc metal as anode materials suffer from Zn dendrite formation and hydrogen evolution during the stripping/plating process, which will lead to performance degradation and hinder practical application. Herein, the 1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide (NI) is proposed as a promising dendrite-free organic anode material for ZIBs. Moreover, the effect of different binders on electrochemical performance of NI electrode is investigated. Compared NI electrode with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, the NI electrode with the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder shows highly enhanced rate capability (122.2 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)) and cycling performance (123.3 mA h g(-1) at 3 A g(-1) after 2200 cycles). The improvement cycling stability of NI is attributed to PTFE binder, which effectively maintains electrode structure and inhibits dissolution of organic molecules during the cycling process. In addition, the ion kinetics analyses reveal that the superior rate capability is provided by the capacitive charge storage. And the carbonyl group of NI is active center of electrochemistry, which is revealed by in-situ attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and ex-situ Raman. Besides, the aqueous Zn-ion full cell based on metal-free NI anode and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) cathode exhibits excellent rate capability (113.9 mA h g(-1) at 10.0 A g(-1)), high operation voltage of similar to 1.2 V (at 1.0 A g(-1)) and energy density of 50.2 Wh kg(total)(-)(1). This work may provide a new design inspiration to develop organic dendrite-free zinc anodes for high-performance aqueous ZIBs batteries.

TI Hierarchically Designed Co4Fe3@N-Doped Graphitic
   Carbon as an Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution in
   Anion-Exchange-Membrane Water Electrolysis
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB Anion-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have gained considerable attention owing to their low cost and high energy efficiency, combining the advantages of alkaline water electrolyzers (AWEs) and proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Despite these merits, AEMWEs face challenges associated with the insufficient electrochemical activity of transition-metal-based electrocatalysts and their inferior long-term durability, particularly in electrodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To address these issues, hierarchically structured OER electrocatalysts comprising a Co4Fe3 core and N-doped graphitic carbon shell were synthesized in this study by pyrolyzing Co/Fe-Prussian blue analogues (PBAs)-based templates. The resulting electrocatalyst demonstrated exceptional OER activity and durability, attributed to the synergy among the abundant Co3+ species, the high electrochemically active surface area, a highly conductive bimetallic alloy core, and the oxygen-enriched functional groups and pyridinic N in the N-doped carbon shell. The Co4Fe3@N-doped graphitic carbon electrocatalyst exhibited a significantly lower overpotential (245 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and enhanced mass transport kinetics (Tafel slope of 62.9 mV dec(-1)) compared to those of a commercialized precious metal-based IrO2 catalyst (328 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 95.3 mV dec(-1), respectively). In the AEMWE full cells, the electrolyzer based on Co4Fe3@N-doped graphitic carbon delivered a 139% higher energy efficiency and a 70 times lower performance degradation rate compared with those of the IrO2-based counterpart. The proposed PBA-based electrocatalyst can be readily synthesized using a simple synthesis process and nonprecious-metal-based materials, presenting a promising pathway for the cost-effective commercialization of AEMWEs.

TI Highly Selective Photoelectrochemical Assay of Arsenate Based on
   Magnetic Co3O4-Fe3O4 Cubes
   and the Negative-Background Signal Strategy
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Water pollution presents a significant environmental concern on earth. Herein, due to the serious environmental harmfulness of arsenate [As(V)], an iron phthalocyanine (FePc)-induced switchable photocurrent-polarity platform was developed for highly selective assay of As(V). First, magnetic Co3O4-Fe3O4 cubes were obtained by calcination of the CoFe Prussian blue analogue and then functionalized with oligonucleotide (S1). In the presence of As(V), S1 could be released based on the stronger affinity between As(V) and Co3O4-Fe3O4 cubes. After magnetic separation by Co3O4-Fe3O4 cubes, the released S1 was used to trigger the catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) and hybridization chain reaction, resulting in the formation of lots of G-quadruplex structures on the AgInS2/ITO electrode. Then, the capture of FePc by the G-quadruplex led to the switch of the photocurrent polarity of the AgInS2/ITO electrode from the anode to the cathode. Thus, As(V) was sensitively assayed with a low detection limit of 1.0 nM and a wide linear response range from 10 nM to 200 mu M. This meets the detection requirement of the World Health Organization for the arsenic concentration in drinking water [less than 10 mu g L-1 (130 nM)]. In addition, whether it was cationic or anionic interferents except phosphate (PO43-), only As(V) could generate the cathodic photocurrent, effectively avoiding the false-positive or false-negative results during As(V) assay. Interestingly, As(V) was also simultaneously separated from the detection system by Co3O4-Fe3O4 magnetic cubes. The proposed photoelectrochemical platform may have a great potential application for the selective detection of As(V) in environmental fields.

TI Electrochemical semi-sacrificial growth of a self-supporting MOF-based
   electrode for urea electrooxidation-coupled water electrolysis
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB Replacing the anodic oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis with thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reactions is appealing for reducing the energy consumption of hydrogen production but is limited by the lack of efficient yet cost-effective electrodes. Herein, a self-supporting NiFe-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA) electrode (NiFe-PBA-NF) was directly prepared via a facile semi-sacrificial anodic electrodeposition strategy, in which ultrasmall NiFe-PBA nanoparticles were grown uniformly and compactly on the nickel foam (NF) surface. Benefiting from its ingenious structure and the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe sites, the as-prepared NiFe-PBA-NF exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a required potential of only 1.375 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), outperforming the powdered NiFe-PBA and even the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, a Ru-NiFe-PBA-NF electrode assembled with ultrathin Ru-doped NiFe-PBA nanosheets was fabricated through further Ru-modification treatment, which exhibited a remarkable electrochemical performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), even better than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Ultimately, a UOR-coupled energy-saving hybrid water electrolysis system was constructed by employing Ru-NiFe-PBA-NF and NiFe-PBA-NF as the electrodes for the cathodic HER and anodic UOR, respectively, which only requires a cell voltage of 1.36 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), far superior to a conventional water electrolysis system. This work provides a novel way to design advanced organic-inorganic hybrid-based electrodes and innovative water electrolysis systems for efficient hydrogen production.

TI Hierarchical Hollow-Nanocube Ni-Co
   Skeleton@MoO3/MoS2 Hybrids for
   Improved-Performance Lithium-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Improving the performance of anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is a hotly debated topic. Herein, hollow Ni-Co skeleton@MoS2/MoO3 nanocubes (NCM-NCs), with an average size of about 193 nm, have been synthesized through a facile hydrothermal reaction. Specifically, MoO3/MoS2 composites are grown on Ni-Co skeletons derived from nickel-cobalt Prussian blue analogue nanocubes (Ni-Co PBAs). The Ni-Co PBAs were synthesized through a precipitation method and utilized as self-templates that provided a larger specific surface area for the adhesion of MoO3/MoS2 composites. According to Raman spectroscopy results, as-obtained defect-rich MoS2 is confirmed to be a metallic 1T-phase MoS2. Furthermore, the average particle size of Ni-Co PBAs (approximate to 43 nm) is only about one-tenth of the previously reported particle size (approximate to 400 nm). If assessed as anodes of LIBs, the hollow NCM-NC hybrids deliver an excellent rate performance and superior cycling performance (with an initial discharge capacity of 1526.3 mAh g(-1) and up to 1720.6 mAh g(-1) after 317 cycles under a current density of 0.2 A g(-1)). Meanwhile, ultralong cycling life is retained, even at high current densities (776.6 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) after 700 cycles and 584.8 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1) after 800 cycles). Moreover, at a rate of 1 A g(-1), the average specific capacity is maintained at 661 mAh g(-1). Thus, the hierarchical hollow NCM-NC hybrids with excellent electrochemical performance are a promising anode material for LIBs.

TI Electrode particulate materials for advanced rechargeable batteries: A
   review
SO PARTICUOLOGY
AB The demand for large-scale energy storage is increasing due to the decreasing non-renewable resources and deteriorating environmental pollution. Developing rechargeable batteries with high energy density and long cycle performance is an ideal choice to meet the demand of energy storage system. The development of excellent electrode particles is of great significance in the commercialization of next-generation batteries. The ideal electrode particles should balance raw material reserves, electro-chemical performance, price and environmental protection. Among them, the development of electrode particulate materials with excellent electrochemical properties is the top priority at present. In this re-view, the typical researches of electrode materials are summarized in terms of crystal structure, morphology, pore structure, surface and interface regulation. Firstly, the structural characteristics and improvement methods of transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds, Prussian blue and their an-alogues are introduced. Then, the different effects of particulate morphology, pore, surface and interface structure on the performance of electrode materials are discussed. For designing high-performance electrode materials, preparation route should be set according to the particle properties of the mate-rials and the synergistic effect of various optimization methods should be adopted. At the same time, in addition to the electrode materials, other components of the rechargeable batteries, such as current collector, separator and electrolytes, should be optimized to improve the overall performance of the batteries. This review would provide important guiding principle for designing high-performance electrode particulate materials.& COPY; 2023 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB In this work, NiO/NiFe2O4@Zn0.76Co0.24Snanocages (NCs) with core-shell type double heterostructures were synthesized using a core-shell design scheme. Among them, NiO/NiFe(2)O(4)cubic cores were obtained by calcination of Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), and Zn-Co-like zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) growed in situ around these cubic cores and were sulfided to obtain NiO/NiFe2O4@Zn0.76Co0.24S NCs. The composite has a large specific surface area of 249.66 m2g-1due to the inherited structure of the two bimetallic organic frameworks. And there is a core-shell double heterogeneous synergy between the Zn0.76Co0.24S NCs and p-p heterostructured NiO/NiFe2O4, which makes the modified electrode exhibit superior electrochemical performance for Bromisoval (BVU). In addition, glutathione (GSH) was explored to significantly enhance the electrochemical activity ofBVU by nucleophilic substitution binding of its own -SH with -Br on BVU, which greatly improved the sensitivity. Then, GSH was developed as a new functional monomer, and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was selected as a secondary functional monomer, and molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) of BVU was prepared by CV electropolymerization to achieve a specific recognition of BVU. An electrochemical sensor based on NiO/NiFe2O4@Zn0.76Co0.24S NCs and MIP was constructed to detect BVU by DPV. Under the optimal conditions, the oxidation peak current of BVU was linear over the concentration range of 0.006-3.5 mu M, with the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 0.28 nm and 0.933 nm, respectively. The sensitivity reached 11.0303 mu Amiddot mu M-1middotcm-2. The method has a wider linear range and lower detection limits compared to other assays for BVU.And the sensor showed excellent reproducibility, repeatability and stability and had been applied to the determination of BVU in human serum and cosmeticswith satisfactory results

TI Facile synthesis of Cu-PBA nanocubes/graphene oxide composite as
   binder-free electrodes for supercapacitor
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Prussian blue and its analogues as one of the metal-organic frameworks are commonly used for fabricating energy storage electrodes due to their outstanding properties such as the high surface area, 3D porous networks, and the low cost. However, they are suffering from ther low energy density and conductivity that can limit their further applications. Herein we utilize a facile and new bottom-up protocol for the deposition of copper hexacyanoferrate nanocubes (Cu-PBA) on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors. This paper draws a complete picture for the merits of handy successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique for coating CuPBA@GO nanocomposite on the inexpensive stainless steel substrate. The effect of the reaction cycles on the morphology, crystallinity, and electrochemical behavior of Cu-PBA@GO nanocomposite, besides the effective synergism between the Cu-PBA and graphene oxide were studied. FTIR, XPS, SEM, TEM and XRD assured the formation of cubic Cu-PBA in the hybrid Cu-PBA/GO thin films. Interestingly, the hybrid SS/Cu-PBA@GO-12 could deliver an eminent specific capacitance of 611.6 F/g which is 2.7 times of that for the pure Cu-PBA (225.93 F/g) at an applied current density of 0.5 A/g with better cycling stability as it could retain approximately 86% of its initial capacitance after performing 2000 cycles at a current density of 4 A/g. Additionally, the hybrid electrode could achieve a supreme energy density value of 54.37 Wh/kg at a specific power of 200 W/kg. Such an outstanding electrochemical behavior of Cu-PBA@GO hybrid could open the way for the development of smart and flexible supercapacitors by using a green and cost-effective method instead of the organic-based ones.

An electrochemical sensor based on NiO/NiFe2O4@Zn0.76Co0.24S NCs and MIP was constructed to detect BVU by DPV. Under the optimal conditions, the oxidation peak current of BVU was linear over the concentration range of 0.006-3.5 mu M, with the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 0.28 nm and 0.933 nm, respectively. The sensitivity reached 11.0303 mu Amiddot mu M-1middotcm-2. The method has a wider linear range and lower detection limits compared to other assays for BVU.And the sensor showed excellent reproducibility, repeatability and stability and had been applied to the determination of BVU in human serum and cosmeticswith satisfactory results.

TI Fabrication of hollow MnFe2O4 nanocubes assembled
   by CoS2 nanosheets for hybrid supercapacitors
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Even though the transition metal oxides (TMOs) are theoretically favorable for supercapacitors, the low electrical conductivity and durability hinder their major practical application. Designing TMOs with innovative nano structures and unique properties is an effective strategy to overcome these limitations and boost their electrochemical properties. Considering this, in this research, we design hollow MnFe2O4 nanocubes assembled by CoS2 nanosheets (designated as HMFO-CSN) and evaluate its supercapacitive performance where it is used as a cathode electrode in the hybrid supercapacitors. The nanostructuring strategy used here includes three steps (i) MnFe-Prussian blue analogue (MnFe-PBA) nanocube formation, (ii) calcination of the MnFe-PBA to produce MnFe2O4 hollow structures, and (iii) growing CoS2 nanosheets on the product through the hydrothermal process to get the final product, i.e., HMFO-CSN. The hollow MnFe2O4 nanocube which acts as the effective skeleton can fasten electron transportation and ion diffusion. Meanwhile, the existing porous CoS2 nanosheet is not only served as an effective outer layer to enhance conductivity but also acts as a structure protector to prevent the collapse and degradation of innerMnFe(2)O(4) hollow nanocube during stability test. Benefiting from such merits, the as-synthesized nanomaterial shows a capacity of 894C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) with a rate capability of 76.2% (681.25C g(-1) at 48 A g(-1)), and excellent 90.5% capacity retention at 12 A g(-1) after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor made of HMFO-CSN (cathode electrode) and activated carbon (AC, anode electrode) delivers an energy density of 63.75 Wh kg- 1 at 850 W kg(-1) with high longevity of 88.5% after 10,000 cycles at 12 A g(-1). The developed synthetic method may offer new inspirations for the fabrication of high-performance electrode materials with advanced structures for various energy-related applications.

TI Emergence of multi-stability and limit cycles in ferromagnetic
   spin-crossover solids under an oscillating magnetic-field: dynamic
   mean-field study
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
AB Two dimension (2D) Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) spin-1 model is used to investigate spin-crossover (SCO) and Prussian Blue Analogs (PBAs) solids. The model considered here allows the system to switch between two fundamental spin states named high-spin (HS) and low-spin (LS) states subsequent to the strength of magnetic and elastic interactions which acting on lattice nearest neighbors sites. These interactions are assumed as temperature-dependent due to the system volume changes accompanying with the spin transition phenomenon. In addition, SCO molecules are subject to a variable frequency of magnetic-field lifting the degeneracy in the HS state. A stochastic cooperative dynamics of this BEG-like Hamiltonian, describing the nonequilibrium properties of ferromagnetic SCO solids, is derived from the Glauber approach, with appropriate Arrhenius microscopic transition rates. At the vicinity of the thermal hysteresis loop of the free system (obtained with zero-magnetic field), investigations with variable oscillation frequency of the magnetic-field, h, demonstrated significant changes on the isothermal relaxation curves of the magnetization, m, and the high-spin fraction, n(H)S, which fall down on dynamical equilibrium characterized by limiting cycles in the spaces m-h and n(HS)-h. In addition, the clear evidence of dephasing between the responses of the two order parameters (m and n(HS)) and the particular "butterfly" shape of the limiting cycles of the HS fraction, enforces the idea that the non-linear effects, propagating through the interaction parameters, are operating in this system. These behaviors demonstrate that radio-frequency magnetic field can be used in these SCO systems to achieve a reversible switch and control of both magnetization and HS fraction, even if the latter is partial. These results are in direct relation with the intrinsic static multi-stability of the system under static magnetic-field, which is enhanced/revealed by applying an oscillating magnetic-field.

TI Layered Bismuth Selenide with a Kinetics-Enhanced Iodine Doping Strategy
   Toward High-Performance Aqueous Potassium-Ion Storage
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Aqueous potassium-ion batteries with inherent safety, high abundance, and competitive hydrated ion-radius point to future availability in energy storage. However, the extensively studied electrodes (metal-oxides, Prussian-blue-analogues, etc.) typically suffer from undesirable capacities and sluggish kinetics owing to overwhelming ion diffusion barriers. Herein, for the first time, the metal chalcogenide bismuth selenide reinforced by iodine-doping (I-Bi2Se3) is implemented for high-performance aqueous potassium-ion storage. The co-intercalation mechanism of potassium-ion with proton in I-Bi2Se3 is entirely revealed by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and substantial ex-situ analysis, and the excellent interlayer diffusion kinetics in the high-conductive host are further enhanced by iodine-doping, as proposed by theoretic calculations. Therefore, the resulting high diffusion coefficient and low interfacial transfer resistance endow I-Bi2Se3 with superior rate performance (109.2 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) and cycling stability (91% capacity retention after 1200 cycles). Employing in hybrid-ion batteries matching zinc metal, the highest reversible aqueous potassium-ion storage to date of 316.8 mAh g-1 is demonstrated, permitting the establishment of reliable performance pouch cells. The promising aqueous potassium intercalation chemistry built in the improved metal chalcogenide is proven to be extendable to other hybrid-ion devices, offering novel mechanistic insights and material practices for aqueous energy storage.
   The high-conductivity iodine-doped bismuth selenide cathode demonstrates the mechanism of proton and potassium-ion co-intercalation for aqueous potassium-ion energy storage devices.

TI Electron Manipulation and Surface Reconstruction of Bimetallic
   Iron-Nickel Phosphide Nanotubes for Enhanced Alkaline Water Electrolysis
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Developing high-efficiency and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting remains a great challenge. Herein, NiMoO4 nanowires as sacrificial templates to synthesize Mo-doped NiFe Prussian blue analogs are employed, which can be easily phosphorized to Mo-doped Fe2xNi2(1-x)P nanotubes (Mo-FeNiP NTs). This synthesis method enables the controlled etching of NiMoO4 nanowires that results in a unique hollow nanotube architecture. As a bifunctional catalyst, the Mo-FeNiP NTs present lower overpotential and Tafel slope of 151.3 (232.6) mV at 100 mA cm-2 and 76.2 (64.7) mV dec-1 for HER (OER), respectively. Additionally, it only requires an ultralow cell voltage of 1.47 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2 for overall water splitting and can steadily operate for 200 h at 100 mA cm-2. First-principles calculations demonstrate that Mo doping can effectively adjust the electron redistribution of the Ni hollow sites to optimize the hydrogen adsorption-free energy for HER. Besides, in situ Raman characterization reveals the dissolving of doped Mo can promote a rapid surface reconstruction on Mo-FeNiP NTs to dynamically stable (Fe)Ni-oxyhydroxide layers, serving as the actual active species for OER. The work proposes a rational approach addressed by electron manipulation and surface reconstruction of bimetallic phosphides to regulate both the HER and OER activity.
   The Mo-doped Fe2xNi2(1-x)P nanotubes are synthesized and can be directly employed as a superior bifunctional electrocatalyst. The result reveals that the bimetallic FeNiP system with Mo doping can manipulate electron redistribution to optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy for HER and lead to rapid surface reconstruction to form high active (Fe)Ni-oxyhydroxide layers for OER, thus endowing extraordinary bifunctional catalytic performance. image

TI Rational Design of Dendritic Phase-Pure Tin Antimonide Intermetallic
   Film-Based Negatrodes for Commercially-Viable Flexible Sodium-Ion Pouch
   Cell Battery
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Exploiting the ability to directly deposit larger-sized, flexible, alloying-type sodium-ion battery electrodes without the need of additional inactive components and processing steps is a strategic way to achieve higher gravimetric capacities which will be suitable for commercial-level sodium-ion (SIB) pouch cell manufacturing. In this regard, a simple, template-free electroplating protocol is reported for designing phase-pure tin antimonide (TA)-based negatrode. An optimum control over the potentiostatic electroplating parameters allows the preferential formation of dendritic nanostructures over an electroplated foam-based current collector. The prepared negatrode and Mn-based Prussian blue analog positrode in full coin cell format deliver an average nominal working voltage of 3.0 V with a discharge energy density of 342 Wh kg-1. In single-layer full pouch cell format, an 8.01 mAh capacity (89.89 mAh g-1, 593.3 mu Ah cm-2) is achieved at an undeformed state and 97.12% capacity is retained at 180 degrees bend condition. In multi-layer full pouch cell format, a 35.86 mAh capacity (80.58 mAh g-1, 531.2 mu Ah cm-2) is achieved with 62.77% capacity retention after 200 cycles (0.125 C). The results of this work showcase how a simple, template free, aqueous electrolyte based electroplating protocol can be developed for the direct fabrication of large-sized, flexible, alloying-type negatrodes for commercial SIB pouch cells.

TI Assessing the impact of an antisolvent-regulated ZnCl2
   water-in-salt electrolyte on solvation structure: a multiscale
   computational validation for aqueous Zn-ion battery application
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB This investigation delves into the profound alterations induced by methanol (MeOH) as an antisolvent in ZnCl2 water-in-salt electrolyte (WiSE), specifically focusing on its influence on the solvation shell. Employing a comprehensive array of ex situ techniques and theoretical calculations, we scrutinize the chemical environment of solvated species. Remarkably, Raman and IR spectroscopy analysis unveiled a marked transformation in the solvation shell of the Zn2+ ion upon the addition of methanol, characterized by a discernible reduction in hydrogen bonding between H2O-MeOH, correlating with methanol volume percentage. This observation is in good agreement with radial distribution function calculations. Consequently, the introduction of the antisolvent displayed discernible changes in ionic mobility and diffusion coefficients. Deeper insights into ion diffusivity and ionic mobility in the antisolvent-based electrolyte are gleaned through mean square displacement (MSD) and spatial distribution function (SDF) calculations. Moreover, the electrochemical ramifications of the modified electrolyte are substantiated by its application in investigating a Prussian blue analogue with rhombohedral structure (PBAR) in a half-cell. Notably, the PBAR demonstrates an augmented zinc storage capability and reversibility when utilized with 10 m ZnCl2-WiSE-10% MeOH and exhibited a 17% improvement in specific capacity from 56 mA h g(-1) to 67 mA h g(-1). Furthermore, a full-cell aqueous zinc-ion battery comprising a PBAR as a cathode and Zn as an anode, integrated with 10 m ZnCl2-WiSE-2% MeOH and operated at a high C-rate of 6C, exhibited exceptional reversibility, delivering high coulombic efficiency of >90% with better capacity retention. Thus, this exploration promises to furnish novel insight into the optimization of solvation structures, thereby bolstering the performance-cum-efficiency of aqueous zinc-based battery systems.

TI Can NiFe-Layered-Double-Hydroxide Catalysts Suppress Carbon Corrosion in
   Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution?
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Sustainable energy societies demand rechargeable batteries using ubiquitous-material electrodes of geopolitical-risk-free elements. We aim to develop low-overpotential oxygen-evolution-reaction (OER) catalysts that suppress carbon corrosion of gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to realize two-electrode rechargeable Zn-air batteries (r-ZABs). Herein, single-walled-carbon-nanotube (SWNT) thin films are used as a scaffold for a benchmark OER catalyst, doping-free NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFeLDHs), operating in r-ZABs using alkali aqueous electrolytes. Metal compositions of NiFeLDHs are controlled with an atomic-level quality using Prussian-blue-analog nanoparticles of Ni x Fe1-x [Fe(CN)6]0.67 (x = 0-1). The nanoparticles with dimensions of similar to 8 nm adhere to SWNTs on carbon paper as a GDE model by a drop-casting method using their aqueous dispersion solutions. Ni0.6Fe0.4[Fe(CN)6]0.67 shows OER activity by hydrolysis for generating NiFeLDH nanodots of metal compositions between Ni0.5Fe0.5 and Ni0.6Fe0.4 with a size distribution of 1.75 +/- 0.26 nm and exposing OER-active (018) and (015) planes on SWNTs. The activity is investigated by regulating the loading amounts of the NPs to avoid aggregating the nanodots. An optimal low-loading amount of 270 nmol cm-2 minimizes iR-corrected overpotential to 156 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The iR-uncorrected overpotential is 260 mV and suppresses carbon corrosion of SWNTs and carbon black. Using an r-ZAB half-cell with a Zn foil, OER-driven charging stably proceeds at 10 mA cm-2 over 3 h with an average voltage of 1.99 V vs Zn/Zn2+. Limited metal electrodes have further improved OER overpotentials by third-element doping, while carbon electrodes still offer room for discovering intrinsically high OER activities of NiFeLDHs without doping.

TI Research progresses on cathode materials of aqueous zinc-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Electrochemical energy storage and conversion techniques that exhibit the merits such as high energy density, rapid response kinetics, economical maintenance requirements and expedient installation procedures will hold a pivotal role in the forthcoming energy storage technologies revolution. In recent years, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered substantial attention as a compelling candidate for large-scale energy storage systems, primarily attributable to their advantageous features encompassing cost-effectiveness, environmental sustainability, and robust safety profiles. Currently, one of the primary factors hindering the further development of AZIBs originates from the challenge of cathode materials. Specifically, the three mainstream types of mainstream cathode materials, in terms of manganese-based compounds, vanadium-based compounds and Prussian blue analogues, surfer from the dissolution of Mn 2+ , in the low discharge voltage, and the low specific capacity, respectively. Several strategies have been developed to compensation the above intrinsic defects for these cathode materials, including the ionic doping, defect engineering, and materials match. Accordingly, this review first provides a systematic summarization of the zinc storage mechanism in AZIBs, following by the inherent merit and demerit of three kind of cathode materials during zinc storage analyzed from their structure characteristic, and then the recent development of critical strategies towards the intrinsic insufficiency of these cathode materials. In this review, the methodologies aimed at enhancing the efficacy of manganese-based and vanadium-based compounds are emphasis emphasized. Additionally, the article outlines the future prospective directions as well as strategic proposal for cathode materials in AZIBs.

TI Intercalation-deposition mechanism induced by aligned carbon fiber
   toward dendrite-free metallic potassium batteries
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Metallic potassium (K) anodes are highly desirable for high energy density batteries. However, challenges lie in uncontrollable dendrite growth and/or inevitable generation of dead K. Here, composite anodes are constructed by covering a layer of aligned carbon fiber on the surface of each metallic K anode (K-ACF). Symmetrical KACF//K-ACF cells can work stably without short circuit for over 600 h, which is quite longer than cells using composite anodes with unaligned carbon fiber (K-UCF) and bare metallic K anodes. Comprehensive characterizations reveal a stepwise intercalation-deposition process on the K-ACF anode during the K plating, and the intercalation is proved to be necessary for the uniform K+ flux due to the improved potassiophility of potassiated ACF. Besides, the aligned structure of ACF offers a uniform current density and K+ ion flux on the surface of composite anodes, promoting the stable K stripping/plating. The K-ACF//Prussian blue (PB) cell exhibits a high discharge capacity of 83.6 mAh g-1 (267.4 Wh kg- 1 based on the mass of PB) under a charge/discharge rate of 200 mA g-1 with a capacity loss rate of 0.044% per cycle. This work opens up a new avenue toward high energy and dendrite-free potassium batteries.

Among them, NiO/NiFe2O4 cubic cores were obtained by calcination of Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), and Zn-Co-like zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) growed in situ around these cubic cores and were sulfided to obtain NiO/NiFe2O4@Zn0.76Co0.24S NCs. The composite has a large specific surface area of 249.66 m(2) g(-1) due to the inherited structure of the two bimetallic organic frameworks. And there is a core-shell double heterogeneous synergy between the Zn0.76Co0.24S NCs and p-p heterostructured NiO/NiFe2O4, which makes the modified electrode exhibit superior electrochemical performance for Bromisoval (BVU). In addition, glutathione (GSH) was explored to significantly enhance the electrochemical activity of BVU by nucleophilic substitution binding of its own -SH with -Br on BVU, which greatly improved the sensitivity. Then, GSH was developed as a new functional monomer, and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was selected as a secondary functional monomer, and molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) of BVU was prepared by CV electropolymerization to achieve a specific recognition of BVU. An electrochemical sensor based on NiO/NiFe2O4@Zn0.76Co0.24S NCs and MIP was constructed to detect BVU by DPV. Under the optimal conditions, the oxidation peak current of BVU was linear over the concentration range of 0.006-3.5 mu M, with the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 0.28 nm and 0.933 nm, respectively. The sensitivity reached 11.0303 mu A.mu M-1.cm(-2). The method has a wider linear range and lower detection limits compared to other assays for BVU. And the sensor showed excellent reproducibility, repeatability and stability and had been applied to the determination of BVU in human serum and cosmetics with satisfactory results.

TI High-performance and dendrite-free Zn/KZnHCF batteries boosted by
   aqueous electrolyte mixed with ethanol
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Aqueous Zn-based batteries (AZBs) have attracted great attention due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the Zn anode suffers from problems such as the formation of Zn dendrites. And there are only few active cathode materials which can allow the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions. Thereinto, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising active cathode materials for AZBs, having high operation voltage but poor electrochemical stability. Herein, K2Zn3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) (KZnHCF) particles with cubic morphology are prepared for AZBs, and the electrochemical stability is improved by simply adjusting the composition of the electrolyte solvent in the battery system. Electrochemical tests indicate that the electrolyte with ethanol (EA) as solvent can promote the uniform deposition of zinc, thereby inhibiting the growth of Zn dendrites. Furthermore, ex-situ XRD results prove that the structural damage of KZnHCF during charging-discharge process is greatly alleviated when EA is used as the electrolyte solvent. Nonetheless, using pure EA as electrolyte solvent exposes the batteries to potential safety hazards, and compared with the Zn/KZnHCF batteries with H2O as solvent, the specific capacities of the batteries with EA as solvent are lower. Hence, the mixed electrolytes with different volume ratios (H2O/EA-1:1, H2O/EA-1:2, H2O/EA-2:1) are applied. It's obvious that not only the growth of zinc dendrites is suppressed, but also the electrochemical performances of the batteries are further improved. Overall, a dendrite-free and high-performance Zn/KZnHCF battery is obtained by using a mixed electrolyte solvent (H2O/EA-1:1), presenting average specific capacities of 50.0, 49.0, 46.3, and 43.2 mAh g(-1) at current densities of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mA g(-1), and remaining a specific capacity of 29.1 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g-1 after 500 cycles.

TI Achieving efficient urea electrolysis by spatial confinement effect and
   heterostructure
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode in water elec-trolysis, which can reduce the thermodynamic potential of electrochemical water splitting. Currently, UOR performance is mainly limited by the 6 e(-); transfer process, requiring high-performance catalysts to reduce overpotential. Here, we innovatively designed and synthesized a binder-free self-standing composite electro-catalyst, viz. a carbon layer containing Fe2P/Co2P nanoparticles on a nickel foam substrate with Mo2S3 ([Fe2P/ Co2P]@Mo2S3/NF). FeCo-prussian blue analogue (PBA)/nickel foam (NF) was obtained from cobalt-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOFs) by anion exchange at room temperature, and then [Fe2P/Co2P] @Mo2S3/NF was derived through high-temperature phosphating and hydrothermal treatment of FeCo-PBA/NF. After high-temperature phosphating treatment, FeCo-PBA collapses to form a carbon layer tightly wrapping on the NF skeleton. The carbon layer has a confinement effect on Fe2P/Co2P nanoparticles, preventing the nano -particles from agglomerating and deactivating. Simultaneously, Fe2P/Co2P/NF and Mo2S3 form a heterostructure to optimize the electronic structure and accelerate electron transfer and urea activation, and make metal phosphides prone to interfacial oxidation during UOR catalysis. The internal carbon layer containing (FeP)-P-2/(CoP)-P-2 nanoparticles acts as a conductive support for better electron transfer from the interior to the exterior metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide species and Mo2S3 species. The synergistic interaction amang Fe2P/Co2P, hydroxide/ oxyhydroxide and Mo2S3 enhances the catalytic performance of [Fe2P/Co2P]@Mo2S3/NF. Strong hydrophilicity and superaerophobicity are conducive to electrolyte immersion and bubble detachment, which further promotes the [Fe2P/Co2P]@Mo2S3/NF catalyst to exhibit excellent UOR catalytic performance, only requiring potential of 1.36 V (vs. RHE) at 100 mA cm(-2) with low Tafel slope of 41.5 (-1) in alkaline solution. Remarkably, the electrochemical activity of [Fe2P/Co2P]@Mo2S3/NF displays only slightly decay after 72 h durability test.

TI Color-Changing Microfiber-Based Multifunctional Window Screen for
   Capture and Visualized Monitoring of NH3
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Air pollution is one of the most serious issues affecting the world today. Instead of expensive and energy intensive air filtering devices, a fiber-based transparent air filter coated on a window screen is seen as one of the state-of-the-art filtration technologies to combat the seriously growing problem, delivering the advantages of simplicity, convenience, and high filtering efficiency. However, such a window screen is currently limited to particulate matter (PM) filtration and ineffective with other air pollutants. Here, we report the use of a newfangled type of color-changing fibers, porous Prussian blue analogues (CuHCF)/polymer composite microfibers, for transparent window screens toward air pollutant filtration. To increase pollution filtration, pores and dimples are purposely introduced to the fibers using binary solvent systems through a nonsolvent-induced phase separation mechanism. Such composite microfibers overcome some of the limitations of those previously used fibers and could simultaneously capture PM2.5, PM10, and NH3 with high efficiency. More interestingly, a distinct color change is observed upon exposure to air pollutants in such window screens, which provides multifunctional capability of simultaneous pollutant capture and naked eye screening of the pollutant amount. Specifically, in the case of long-term exposure to low-concentration NH3, the symbol displayed in such window screens changes from yellow color to brown and the coloration rate is directly controlled by the NH3 concentration, which may serve as a careful reminder for those people who are repeatedly exposed to low-concentration ammonia gas (referred to as chronic poisoning). In contrast, after short-term exposure to a high concentration of ammonia gas, the yellow symbol immediately becomes blackened, which provides timely information about the risk of acute ammonia poisoning or even ammonia explosion. Further spectroscopic results show that the chromatic behaviors in response to different concentrations of NH3 are fundamentally different, which is related to the different locations of ammonia in the lattice of CuHCF, either in its interstitial sites or at the Fe(CN)(6) vacancy sites, largely distinguished by the absence or presence of atmospheric moisture.

TI Simultaneous determination of four local anesthetics by CE with ECL and
   study on interaction between procainamide and human serum albumin
SO TALANTA
AB A new method of capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled with tris(2, 2'-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection has been developed to detect four local anesthetics procainamide (PAH), tetracaine (TCH), proparacaine (PCH) and cinchocaine (CIN) simultaneously. An europium (III) doped prussian blue analogue film (Eu-PB) modified platinum electrode was prepared and applied to improve the detection sensitivity. The parameters including additives, concentration and pH of the running buffer, separation voltage and detection potential that affect CE separation and ECL detection were optimized in detail. The four local anesthetics were baseline separated and detected within 10 min under the optimized conditions. The detection limits (LOD) of PAH, TCH, PCH and CIN are 5.5 x 10(-8), 9.6 x 10(-8), 2.5 x 10(-8) and 3.5 x 10(-8) mol L-1 (S/N=3), respectively. RSDs of the migration time for four analytes range from 1.2% to 2.5% within intraday and from 2.4% to 4.9% in interday, RSDs of the peak area for four analytes are from 1.7% to 3.3% within intraday and from 2.2% to 5.6% in interday, respectively. The limits of quantitation (LOQ) (S/N=10) for PAH, TCH, PCH and CIN in human urine sample are 5.9 x 10(-7), 9.2 x 10(-7), 8.3 x 10(-7) and 5.0 x 10(-7) mol L-1, separately. The recoveries (n=3) of four analytes in human urine are from 87.6% to 107.7% with less than 5.9% in RSDs. The developed method was used to determine four local anesthetics in human urine samples and investigate the interaction between PAH and human serum albumin (HSA). The number of binding sites and the binding constant of PAH with HSA were calculated to be 1.03 and 2.4 x 104 L mol(-1), respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Impact of Photosensitizing Multilayered Structure on
   Ruthenium(II)-Dye-Sensitized TiO2-Nanoparticle Photocatalysts
SO ACS OMEGA
AB To improve the efficiency of photoinduced charge separation on the surface of dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles, we synthesized the Ru(II)-photosensitizerimmobilized, Pt-cocatalyst-loaded TiO2 nanoparticles RuCP2@Pt-TiO2, RuCP2-Zr-RuP6@Pt-TiO2, and RuCP2-Zr-RuP4-Zr-RuP6@Pt-TiO2 (RuCP2 = [ Ru( bpy)(2)(mpbpy)](2-), RuP4 = [ Ru(bpy)(pbpy)(2)](6-), RuP6 = [ Ru(pbpy)(3)](10-), H(4)mpbpy = 2,2'-bipyridine-4,4'-bis(methanephosphonic acid), and H(4)pbpy = 2,2'-bipyridine-4,4'- bis(phosphonic acid)) using phosphonate linkers with bridging Zr4+ ions. X-ray fluorescence and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra revealed that a layered molecular structure composed of Ru(II) photosensitizers and Zr4+ ions (i.e., RuCP2-Zr-RuP6 and RuCP2-Zr-RuP4-Zr-RuP6) was successfully formed on the surface of Pt-TiO2 nanoparticles, which increased the surface coverage from 0.113 nmol/cm(2) for singly layered RuCP2@Pt-TiO2 to 0.330 nmol/cm(2) for triply layered RuCP2-Zr-RuP4-Zr-RuP6@Pt-TiO2. The photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity of the doubly layered RuCP2-Zr-RuP6@Pt-TiO2 was three times higher than that of the singly layered RuCP2@Pt-TiO2, whereas the activity of triply layered RuCP2-Zr-RuP4-Zr-RuP6@Pt-TiO2 was less than half of that for RuCP2@Pt-TiO2. The photosensitizing efficiencies of these Ru(II)-photosensitizer-immobilized nanoparticles f or the O-2 evolution reaction catalyzed by the Co(II)-containing Prussian blue analogue [Co-II(H2O)(2)](1.31)[{Co-III(CN)(6)}(0.63){Pt-II(CN)(4)}(0.37)] decreased as the number of Ru(II)-photosensitizing layers increased. Thus, crucial aspects of the energy-and electron-transfer mechanism for the photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions involve not only the Ru(II)-complex-TiO2 interface but also the multilayered structure of the Ru(II)-photosensitizers on the Pt-TiO2 surface.

TI Zero thermal expansion in NiPt(CN)6
SO PROGRESS IN NATURAL SCIENCE-MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL
AB Nowadays, an increasing number of scientists attach more importance to zero thermal expansion (ZTE) materials which are uncommon yet highly significant in the field of solid-state materials. The key to explore new ZTE compounds is to understand the mechanism, while it remains unclear. Here, we utilize density functional theory calculations to elucidate the mechanisms of NiPt(CN)6. 6 . A joint study of bond nature, atomic mean-square displacements, phonon dispersion curves, Gr & uuml;neisen parameters, and phonon vibrations to systematically analyze the ZTE mechanisms. The results suggest that the transverse vibrations of the -C-N- groups are instrumental, particularly due to the involvement of the N atoms and the nature of the Ni-N and Pt-C bonds. Phonon modes with negative Gr & uuml;neisen parameters at low frequencies play the mainly role to balance the positive thermal expansion from others frequency zone modes to obtain the ZTE behavior. This work demonstrates that NiPt(CN)6 6 maintains substantial similarities with its trivalent-trivalent analogues, further enhancing our comprehension of NTE properties within open- framework structure.

TI Co(CN)3 catalysts with well-defined coordination structure
   for the oxygen reduction reaction
SO NATURE CATALYSIS
AB Metal-nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N-C) catalysts are promising platinum group metals alternatives for fuel cell cathodes; however, their randomly formed, unpredictable coordinations complicate any structure-property investigation and lead to low active site density. Here we achieve dense and well-defined cobalt sites on the surfaces of Co(CN)(3) microcrystals, which are identified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations elucidate that the high oxygen reduction reaction performance (half-wave potential is 0.90 V versus RHE) of the cubic Co(CN)(3) is due to its tailored coordination environment that optimizes *OH desorption. The cyanide linkage with minimized spacing between cobalt atoms maximizes active sites' spatial density, which boosts the anion-exchange membrane fuel cell peak power density to 1.67 W cm(-2). The microcrystals with well-defined coordination structures can be used as Co-N-C analogues for their structure-property relationship investigations.

TI Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Properties of Zeolite-Like
   T3(H3O)2[M(CN)6]2
   •uH2O (T = Co, Zn; M = Ru, Os)
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB We report the synthesis, crystal structures, and related properties of six new zeolite-like hexacyanometallates of formula unit T-3(H3O)(2)[M(CN)(6)](2)uH(2)O (T = Co2+, Zn2+; M = Ru-II, Os-II). Their crystal structures were solved and refined from their X-ray powder diffraction patterns in combination with the IR and UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopic data. The Co and Zn ions are coordinated tetrahedrally to the N atoms of four CN groups. The deconvolution of the overlapped UV/Vis/NIR spectral bands provided conclusive evidence of the tetrahedral coordination of the Co atoms. These materials have porous frameworks, which are characterized by a 3D array of TN4 tetrahedral units linked to the MC6 octahedral blocks in a 3:2 ratio. From the IR spectroscopy results, we found that all of the compounds reported here contain hydronium countercations. Two different structures in the same space group (R<styled-content style="text-decoration:overline">3</styled-content>c) were identified for the Co-based materials. However, only a single phase was found for the Zn-containing compounds. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling predicts hydrogen bonds between the hydronium ions and the CN groups at the surfaces of the pores. These materials were prepared through the hydrothermal recrystallization of the solids obtained from mixing ethanol solutions of H-4[M(CN)(6)] with aqueous solutions of cobalt(II) nitrate and zinc nitrate. Our results illustrate the potential of the hydrothermal recrystallization technique for the preparation of metal hexacyanometallates with new structures and pore topologies that are not obtainable by the traditional precipitation method.

TI Highly crystalline sodium manganese ferrocyanide microcubes for advanced
   sodium ion battery cathodes
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The microstructure and morphology of the crystal play an important role in the physical and electrochemical properties of electrode materials. Here we report a highly crystalline microcube structure of Na-rich Prussian white Na1.92Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.98) for sodium ion battery cathodes. The obtained structure features high crystallinity of the monoclinic structure with an average cubic size of 3-5 mu m. Because of the improvement on microstructural and electrical properties, the cathode design enables promising electrochemical performance. The electrode exhibits an outstanding rate performance with reversible capacities of 152.8 mA h g(-1) (10 mA g(-1)), 128.1 mA h g(-1) (100 mA g(-1)), 118.7 mA h g(-1) (500 mA g(-1)) and 110.3 mA h g(-1) (1000 mA g(-1)). It also exhibits a good cycling performance with a capacity retention of 82% after 500 cycles at 100 mA g(-1). More importantly, the XRD analysis reveals a highly reversible monoclinic-cubic-monoclinic structural evolution of the cathode upon Na+ extraction/insertion. The good rate and cycling performance can be attributed to the robust crystal structure with few defects and fast Na+ transfer kinetics. The high purity single crystal morphology can also reduce the side reactions on the electrode/electrolyte interface.

TI Manipulating the electrocatalytic activity of sulfur cathode via
   distinct cobalt sulfides as sulfur host materials in lithium-sulfur
   batteries
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB For the better development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, it is necessary to fabricate sulfur hosts with cheap, rapid sulfur reaction dynamic and inhibiting the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, four hollow cubic materials with two kinds of nitrogen-doped carbon derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBA) precursor, Co9S8/MnS/NC@NC-400, CoS2/MnS/NC@NC-500, CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 and CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-700, are reported when the vulcanization temperatures are regulated at 400 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C, respectively. Among them, Co9S8/MnS/NC@NC-400, CoS2/MnS/ NC@NC-500 and CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 have the similar hollow cubic structure, which can physically confine the LiPSs's shuttle, however, the Co vacancies of CoS1.097 in the CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 can promote the rearrangement of surface electrons, which is beneficial to the diffusion of Li+/e-, improving the electrochemical reaction kinetics. As for the CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-700 with the same substance but almost collapsed structure, the CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 can accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur conversion. In the four sulfur-host materials, the CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 not only displays the outstanding adsorption ability on LiPSs, but also presents the best electrocatalytic activity in the Li2S potentiostatic deposition experiments and active sulfur reduction/oxidation conversion reactions, greatly promoting the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries. The S@CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 cathode can deliver 1010.2 mA h g-1 at 0.5 C and maintain 651.1 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles. In addition, the in-situ X-ray diffraction (in-situ XRD) test reveals that the sulfur conversion mechanism is the processes of the ocS8 -. Li2S -. /3-S8 (first cycle), then /3-S8 M Li2S during the subsequent cycles. Based on the fundamental understanding of the design and preparation of CoxSy/MnS/NC@NC hosts with the desired adsorption and catalysis functions, the work can provide new insights and reveal the defect-engineering to develop the advanced Li-S batteries.

TI A Co@C Catalyst Derived from a Cobalt-Based Metal Organic Framework with
   Enhanced Activation of Peroxymonosulfate for Degradation of Organic
   Pollutants
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB Cobalt-based catalysts are widely used as efficient activator for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). A new carbon enclosed magnetic metal cobalt (Co@C) catalyst was successfully synthesized by high-temperature pyrolysis of cobalt-based metal-organic framework. The prepared Co@C catalyst demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity for the degradation of contaminants (99.9 % for tetracycline (TC) degradation within 10 min). The TC degradation efficiency could still sustain more than 99 % after three cycles. Moreover, the Co@C/PMS system exhibited great universality for the rapid removal of other dyes such as methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB). The zero-valent cobalt was engaged in the activation of the PMS and reacted with O-2 to form Co2+, to make sure that there was enough Co2+ to activate PMS to generate Co3+. Simultaneously, the produced Co3+ ions extracted electrons out of HSO5- , driving a Co-0/Co2+/Co3+ circulation to keep the high efficiency for rapid degradation of TC. In summary, this work offers a novel strategy to develop an effective magnetic heterogeneous catalyst to activate PMS for the elimination of difficult to degrade contaminants.

AB Iron cyanide compounds are among the oldest known synthetic coordination compounds, dating back to the early 18(th) century. By contrast, iron complexes of the cyaphide ion (C  P-)-a heavy valence isoelectronic analog of the cyanide ion-are unknown. Herein we report the synthesis of highly stable mono- and bis-cyaphide complexes of iron(II), namely Fe(depe)(2)(Cl)(CP) and Fe(depe)(2)(CP)(2) (depe = 1,2-bis(diethylphosphino)ethane).

TI Recent Advances in Phosphate Cathode Materials for Sodium-ion Batteries
SO ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA
AB Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles because of their high energy density and long cycle life. Sodium-ion batteries have broad application prospects in the areas of large-scale electrochemical energy storage systems and low-speed electric vehicles because of their abundant raw materials, low resource cost, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of sodium-ion batteries has been hindered by the low reversibility, sluggish ion diffusion, and large volume variations of the host materials. Suitable electrode materials with decent electrochemical performance must be primarily explored for the successful use of sodium-ion batteries. Since the electrochemical potential and specific capacities of cathode materials have a major impact on the energy densities of sodium-ion batteries, the development of cathode materials is critical. To date, various Na-insertable frameworks have been proposed, and some cathode materials have been reported to deliver reversible capacities approaching their theoretical values. Among them, transition metal oxides show a high reversible capacity and high working potential, but most of them still possess problems such as irreversible phase transition, air instability, and insufficient battery performance. Another type is the Prussian blue analogs. These materials exhibit a favorable operating voltage, cycling stability, and rate capability; however, the main obstacles to their practical application are the control of lattice defects, thermal instability, and low tap density. Polyanionic phosphates are the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries and have great research value and application prospects because of their stable framework structure, suitable operating voltage, and fast ion diffusion channels. However, their inherent defects, such as poor electronic conductivity and low theoretical energy density, considerably limit their practical applications. Researchers have conducted modification studies through bulk structure adjustment and micro-nano structural control with the goal of improving the performance of phosphate cathode materials and promoting the research and development of sodium-ion energy storage systems. This study reviews the recent advances in phosphate cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, including orthophosphates, pyrophosphates, fluorophosphates, and mixed phosphate compounds. In this study, the intrinsic relationships among material composition, structure, and electrochemical properties are identified through analyses of the crystal structures, sodium storage mechanisms, and modification strategies of phosphate materials, thereby providing a reference for the continuous modification of polyanion phosphate cathode materials and exploration of high-voltage phosphate cathode materials. Some directions for future research and possible strategies for building advanced sodium-ion batteries are also proposed.

TI Nanoparticles of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Derivatives as the Components
   of Electrode Materials for Electrochemical Capacitors
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB Nickel-potassium hexacyanoferrate (KNiHCF) and its analogues (NaKNiHCF) with different Na : K ratio are synthesized by chemical coprecipitation. The salt structure is characterized by the methods of X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive microanalysis, and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical characteristics of composite electrodes containing 20 wt % salt are studied by the methods of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, and impedance spectroscopy. The composite electrodes are shown to exhibit the higher specific capacitance (C-sp) as compared with the carbon electrode. The incorporation of sodium into the KNiHCF structure increases C-sp at the high charge-discharge rates. It is shown that electrodes containing the analogue of NaKNiHCF with the Na/K ratio 0.92 : 0.24 demonstrate the high electronic and ionic conductivity and the low equivalent series resistance and charge-transfer resistance. The latter material can be used as the cathode material in hybrid electrochemical capacitors. The ease of synthesis of these salts and the simple method of electrode fabrication makes possible their large-scale application in rechargeable batteries.

TI A Hybrid VOx Incorporated Hexacyanoferrate
   Nanostructured Hydrogel as a Multienzyme Mimetic via Cascade
   Reactions
SO ACS NANO
AB Inspired by the cascade reactions occurring in micro-organelles of living systems, we have developed a hybrid hydrogel, a nanozyme that mimics three key enzymes including peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. The organic/inorganic nanostructured hydrogel constituting VOx incorporated hexacyanoferrate Berlin green analogue complex (VO(x)BG) is prepared by a simple one-step hydrothermal process, and its composition, structure, and properties are thoroughly investigated. Polyvinylpyrrolidone, a low-cost and biocompatible polymer, was utilized as a scaffold to increase the surface area and dispersion of the highly active catalytic centers of the nanozyme. Compared to the widely used horseradish peroxidase in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, our VO(x)BG analogue hydrogel displays an excellent affinity toward the chromogenic substrate that is used in these peroxidase-based assays. This higher affinity makes it a competent nanozyme for detection and oxidation of biomolecules, including glucose, in a cascade-like system which can be further used for hydrogel photolithography. The VO(x)BG analogue hydrogel also holds a good ability for the rapid and efficient oxidative degradation of environmentally unfriendly recalcitrant substrates under light irradiation. Detailed mechanistic studies of this multifaceted material suggest that different complex catalytic processes and routes are involved in these photo-Fenton and Fenton reactions that are responsible for the generation as well as consumption of reactive oxygen species, which are effectively activated by a multienzyme mimetic of the VO(x)BG analogue hydrogel.

TI Electrolyte Regulation Strategies for Improving the Electrochemical
   Performance of Aqueous Zinc-Ion Battery Cathodes
SO ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA
AB The ever-worsening world-wide energy crisis and environmental issues are encouraging the development of green and renewable energy. Thus, rechargeable batteries are being developed and employed for energy storage and conversion in various electronic equipment. When compared with metal lithium batteries, aqueous rechargeable batteries have gained significant attention due to their advantages of high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Among the various known rechargeable batteries (Li+, Na+, K+, NH4+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Al3+), aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are considered as promising energy storage devices because the zinc electrode exhibits high capacity (820 mAh center dot g(-1)) and low potential (-0.76 V vs. Standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)). To date, various ZIBs cathode materials with excellent performance have been developed, such as manganese- and vanadium-based oxides, Prussian blue and its analogues, and organic compounds. Unfortunately, some of these materials, especially manganese- and vanadium-based oxides, suffer from critical structural collapse, dissolution, and cathode/electrolyte interfacial side reactions, which lead to low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycle performance. The poor cycle performance is one of the main obstacles hindering the large-scale application of manganese- and vanadium-based oxides. Therefore, the structural design of cathodes and electrolyte regulation strategies have been extensively investigated to solve these problems and improve electrochemical performance. In comparison, electrolyte regulation is an important and effective strategy for improving the performance of ZIBs cathodes. It is well known that a strong interaction force exists between Zn2+ and H2O, therefore, Zn2+ can coordinate with six H2O molecules to form [Zn(H2O)(6)](2+) in the dilute aqueous electrolyte, while forming numerous hydrogen bonds between the H2O molecules. The Zn2+-solvation structure and hydrogen bonds can be destructed and restructured by changing the anion, and using highly concentrated electrolyte and/or organic solvent, thereby decreasing the number of H2O molecules in the solvated structure and the activity of free water. Furthermore, additives can change the pH value of the aqueous electrolyte and build a dissolution equilibrium between the cathode and electrolyte. Hence, an appropriate electrolyte regulation strategy can broaden the electrochemical stability window of electrolytes, improve the working potential, suppress the occurrence of interfacial side reactions, and prevent the dissolution of the active materials, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of ZIBs. Herein, we review the possible electrolyte regulation strategies for enhancing the electrochemical performance of ZIBs cathodes and classify regulation strategy into two main categories: 1) Solute (including different zinc salts, additive, and water-in-salt) and 2) Solvent (composite of organic/inorganic hybrid electrolytes). We then discuss the advantages and challenges of each strategy, and finally predict the possible future direction of electrolyte development.

AB We report on a noninvasive hypoxia monitor based on a biosensor linearly responding to lactate through its whole concentration range in human sweat. The biosensor is designed with an additional perfluorosulfonated ionomer (Nafion analogue) membrane acting as a diffusion barrier for lactate due to its intrinsic negative charge. The resulting biosensor linearly responds to lactate in the range from 1 to 100 mM and displays signif-icantly improved operational stability, maintaining its initial response during 3 h in human sweat flow. Thus, the elaborated monitor has been validated through on-body continuous sweat analysis during exhaustive phys-ical exercise. In contrast to periodic sweat sampling, the elaborated monitor allows recording of the true extremes of sweat lactate, which are of particular importance for diagnostics.

TI CuO and spinel CuCo2O4 supported on mesoporous
   nanocubes with dual redox-active centers for electrocatalytic
   H2O2 reduction and sensing
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) nanocube and its cobalt-substituted analogue (CoCuHCF) possess numerous micropores; however, they demonstrate limited electrocatalytic performance for H2O2 reduction. Heat treatment of CuHCF in air (CuHCF-ht) results in the formation of CuO and Fe3O4 with noticeable aggregation. In contrast, the heat treatment of CoCuHCF in air (CoCuHCF-ht) preserves its nanocube structure while also forming a spinel CuCo2O4 phase. The partial substitution of cobalt ions for copper ions in CuHCF enhances both thermal and structural stability, leading to the transformation of micropores into mesopores during heat treatment. This transformation improves electrolyte accessibility and structural integrity. The CoCuHCF-ht electrode features dual redox-active centers (Cu+/Cu2+ couple) derived from the CuO and CuCo2O4 phases, serving as catalytic redox mediators for H2O2 reduction. This dual redox activity results in superior performance for H2O2 reduction compared to CuHCF-ht, which only exhibits a single pair of Cu+/Cu2+ couple from CuO as an active mediator. This enhanced performance is evidenced by a lower Tafel slope, a higher catalytic rate constant, and improved mass transfer of analytes. The CoCuHCF-ht catalyst, characterized by dual redox-active centers in mesoporous nanocubes, demonstrates a high sensitivity of 234.03 mu A mM- 1 cm- 2 and a low limit of detection (0.26 mu M), along with high selectivity, stability, repeatability, and reproducibility.

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB It is fascinating but challenging for nanoscientists to organize nanoparticles (NPs) into ordered architectures just as it is for chemists to manipulate atoms and molecules to form functional molecules and supramolecules. We explore a strategy to assemble anisotropic NPs into open frame-like superstructures via oriented attachment (OA), experimentally realizing a nanoscale analog to the bonding behavior in M8L12-type supramolecular cubes. We highlight the role of NP shape in the OA-involved assembly for constructing predictable superstructures. In addition, the frame-like superstructures can retain their basic structure when undergoing postcrystallization of the building blocks as well as annealing for conversion toward functional electrocatalytic materials. Our work enables fundamental insights into directional "bonding" among NPs and adds to the growing body of knowledge for bottom-up assembly of anisotropic NPs into sophisticated functional materials.

On the other hand, Al is irreversible in aqueous electrolyte with severe hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, we demonstrate a water-in-salt aluminum ion electrolyte (WISE) based on Al and lithium salts to tackle the above challenges. In the WISE system, water molecules can be confined within the Li + solvation structures. This diminished Al 3 + -H 2 O interaction essentially eliminates the hydrolysis effect, effectively protecting Al anode from corrosion. Therefore, long-term Al plating/stripping can be realized. Furthermore, two types of high-performance full batteries have been demonstrated using copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF, a Prussian Blue Analogues) and LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM) as cathodes. The reversibility of Al anode laid the foundation for low cost rechargeable batteries suffering for large-scale energy storage. Broader context: Al batteries are expected to become a safe and sustainable alternative to lithium batteries. For decades, chase for a feasible Al secondary battery has not been successful. The key challenge is to find suitable cathode and electrolyte materials, together with which Al anode battery can function reversibly. Currently, fatal drawbacks have impeded the practical application of Al metal batteries (AMBs), such as sustained corrosion of Al anode and battery case in ionic liquid electrolytes, irreversibility issues as well as severe hydrogen evolution reaction during cycling in aqueous electrolyte. Therefore, electrolyte and their electrochemical kinetics play a vital role in the performance and environmental operating limitations of high-energy Al metal batteries. In this work, we demonstrate a nearly neutral Al ion water-in-salt electrolyte (WISE) to tackle the above challenges. The WISE shows excellent stability in the open atmosphere. The distinct solvation-sheath structure of Al 3 + in the WISE system would protect Al metal anodes from corrosion and eliminate hydrogen evolution reaction effectively, further promoting the reversibility of Al metal anodes with dendrite-free morphology. Moreover, such a WISE exhibits superior compatibility with LiNi 0.3 Co 0.3 Mn 0.3 O 2 (NCM) and copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) cathodes and long-term stabilities with high coulombic efficiency (CE) can be attained for full batteries with the WISE. The approach in this study can furnish an opportunity to develop reversible AMBs and lay the foundation for other potential multivalent-metalbased secondary batteries suffering from interface passivation and poor reversibility, which suggest the promise of multivalent metal batteries and their applications in large-scale energy storage.

TI Crystal Structures, Reaction Mechanisms, and Optimization Strategies of
   MnO2 Cathode for Aqueous Rechargeable Zinc Batteries
SO ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA
AB Because of the advantages of high safety, environment-friendliness, affordability, and ease of processing, aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries (ARZBs) are promising candidates for next-generation large-scale energy storage systems. In recent years, various cathode materials based on vanadium/manganese/cobalt oxides, Prussian blue analogs, and organic compounds have been reported. Among them, manganese dioxide (MnO2) is widely used in ARZBs due to their outstanding advantages of low toxicity, eco-friendliness, and high capacity (616 mAh center dot g(-1) based on two-electron transfer). However, the diversity of the crystal structures of MnO2 and the unpredictability of the electrochemical reaction make it difficult to investigate the specific internal storage mechanism, which impedes further development of the optimal modification strategies. To date, the main recognized energy storage mechanisms are (de)intercalation and dissolution-deposition mechanisms. In the traditional (de)intercalation mechanism, the predominant issues related to MnO2 during the cycling process include Mn dissolution, irreversible phase transformation, structural collapse, and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics. On the other hand, the detailed reaction path for the dissolution-deposition mechanism, which was developed in recent years, remains controversial. In addition, the incomplete dissolution-deposition of MnO2 and the highly acidic environment inevitably leads to corrosion and hydrogen evolution of the zinc anode, as well as low Coulombic efficiency. Accordingly, optimization strategies for different reaction mechanisms have been proposed to make zinc-manganese batteries more competitive. For the (de)intercalation mechanism, modification of composite materials and nanostructure optimization strategies can be adopted to inhibit the dissolution of MnO2 and increase the number of highly active reaction sites, thus enhancing the electrochemical performance. Moreover, the guest pre-intercalation strategy can help optimize the crystal structure of MnO2, preventing the collapse of the internal structure during cycling. Besides, defect engineering and element doping strategies focus on regulating the distribution of the electronic structure for affecting the properties of MnO2, resulting in lowering the energy barrier of zinc insertion. For the dissolution- deposition mechanism, the introduction of a neutral acetate and a halide mediator can effectively facilitate the dissolution-deposition of MnO2. Meanwhile, metal element catalysis can accelerate the reaction kinetics of the MnO2 dissolution-deposition, so that high-rate performance can be achieved. Furthermore, the decoupling battery system can separate the cathodic and anodic electrolytes to restrain the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and enhance the potential difference. The flow battery system can effectively eliminate the influence of concentration polarization and stabilize the ion concentration in the electrolytes, thus leading to a large capacity (>100 mAh). Undoubtedly, MnO2 as a high-capacity, high-voltage cathode material has broad development prospects for ARZBs. Here, we systematically summarize the crystal structures and reaction mechanisms of MnO2.
   We also discuss the optimization strategies toward advanced MnO2 cathode materials for resolving the highlighted issues in zinc-manganese batteries, which are expected to provide research directions for the design and development of high-performance ARZBs.

TI Co Polyoxonnetalates and a Co3O4 Thin Film
   Investigated by L-Edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB We have performed cobalt L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on important materials for photoactive catalysis, namely nanoscale cobalt polyoxometalates (Co POM) and a Co3O4 thin film. A set of Co POM analogues were studied that vary according to the position and number of cobalts within the POM structure, metal valence state, oxygen ligand coordination geometry and heteroatom identity. Ligand field multiplet calculations simulate experimental XAS spectra in well-defined model systems provided by the Co POMs and extended to a Co3O4 thin film, thereby characterizing atomic multiplet and ligand field effects, including the ligand field parameter, structural distortions, and electronelectron interactions for Co2+ and Co3+ ions in both O-h and T-d environments. The ligand field parameter, 10D(q), is determined to within an accuracy of +/- 0.1 eV, the spectra are sensitive to small structural distortions that further split d-levels (0.16 eV), and the strength of electron-electron interactions is found to within +/- 5% of the atomic value. We also find that the electronic structure parameters and the XAS spectra do not vary among POMs with pronounced differences in catalytic activity, and therefore X-ray spectroscopies even more sensitive to the 3d electronic structure (such as resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS)) should be used to differentiate the more active catalysts.

TI Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on the Origin of the High
   Intercalation Voltage of
   K2Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 Cathode
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
CT 19th International Meeting on Lithium Batteries (IMLB)
CY JUN 17-22, 2018
CL Kyoto, JAPAN
AB K2Zn3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) was investigated as a cathode for K-ion batteries and compared to its sodium analog. The hexacyanometallate using K+ as intercalating ion shows interesting electrochemical properties: i) The redox processes occur at higher potentials, ii) From the two redox processes, the one occurring at higher potentials displays most of the specific capacity while the insertion of sodium occurs mostly at lower potentials, iii) the specific capacity of both materials is similar and iv) although the hysteresis at higher potentials is higher with K+ than with Na+, the occurrence of deintercalation at higher potentials presents undoubtedly more advantages. In the attempt to explain this behavior, electronic structure calculations show that a transition from insulating to conducting behavior occurs as the system changes from discharged to charged states. The electronic density distributions of the hosts are similar independently if K+ or Na+ ions are intercalated. It is found that the inclusion of dispersion interactions is essential to match the intercalation voltages experimentally observed. Thus, dispersion forces are very important to understand the interactions of the ion with the host and should be considered when designing cathodes for K-ion batteries using hexacyanometallate.

TI Optical bandgap of Cd, Zn, and Ag nitroprussides. A combined
   experimental and computational study
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS
AB The optical bandgap (E-g) of transition metal nitroprussides remains practically undocumented, probably because these materials are usually considered wide bandgap solids, characterized by a strong metal-ligand charge-transfer band below 500 nm. In this contribution, we are reporting experimental and DFT computed data for both, 3D and 2D phases of Zn and Cd nitroprussides to get physical insight into the metal and structure effect on the optical bandgap (E-g) of these materials. 3D Ag nitroprusside, an analog solid for which the E-g value has been reported, was included for comparison. E-g values were obtained from both, UV-vis-NIR spectra and DFT calculations. The solids under study show a direct bandgap with diverse Urbach tails, which was ascribed to the presence of structural defects. Metal to ligand charge transfer within nitroprusside ion dominates the electronic structure in the valence-gap-conduction region for the 3D systems. Both, the outer metal, and the incorporation of 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone as an organic pillar molecule between adjacent layers for the 2D analogs, influence the electronic structure and consequently, the E-g values obtained. In these materials, the polarizing power of outer metal has a relevant role in the observed E-g value.

TI Core-shell dual-MOF heterostructures derived magnetic
   CoFe2O4/CuO (sub) microcages with superior
   catalytic performance
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The high performance of catalysts relies largely on the meticulous design of hierarchical hollow micro/nanostructures with more active sites and superb structural tenability. Herein, we developed a simple strategy to design and fabricate CoFe2O4/CuO (sub)microcages using core-shell dual-MOF heterostructures (Fe-II-Co PBAs@HKUST-1) as both the precursor and self-sacrificing template. The derivation of metal oxide composites from dual-MOF heterostructures is challenging, and this method could overcome the difficulty caused by the possible lattice mismatch between the different MOFs. Uniform core-shell dual-MOF structures Fe-II-Co PBAs@HKUST-1 were first fabricated and then converted to CoFe2O4/CuO (sub)microcages by thermal annealing in air. The resulting CoFe2O4/CuO (sub)microcages were extensively characterized and exhibited remarkable catalytic performance with an excellent stability and magnetic recyclability for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol by NaBH4. In addition, CoFe2O4/CuO (sub)microcages were also found to be highly active for catalytic reduction of methylene blue (MB) by NaBH4 in an aqueous solution. The results show that CoFe2O4/CuO (sub)microcages have potential application for organic pollutants degradation and environmental rehabilitation.

TI Towards one-step design of tailored enzymatic nanobiosensors
SO ANALYST
AB The manufacturing of conventional enzymatic biosensors produced via a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach requires expensive instrumentation, and in most cases involves a complex, resource and time-consuming fabrication process. Moreover, LbL assemblies are prone to mechanical instability that leads to irreversible changes in sensor architecture and morphology resulting in degradation of enzymatic activities and insufficient signal reproducibility. Hence, novel fabrication techniques for the production of enzymatic biosensors that are instrumentally controlled and allow reproducible, simultaneous multi-analyte detection with high specificity, temporal and spatial resolution are greatly required. Herein, we report on the development of a novel, fully instrumentally controlled, one-step synthesis approach for the production of nanoparticle-based enzymatic biosensors. The approach relies on a simultaneous encapsulation of the enzyme (glucose and alcohol oxidases), a fluoropolymer (Nafion) and noble metal nanoparticles via co-deposition from a phosphate multiple electrolyte on top of the sensor surface. Remarkably, electrochemical studies revealed that nanoparticle-based biosensors produced by this novel fabrication approach display a significantly enhanced mechanical stability (more than several orders of magnitude higher) without loss of biological activity or leakage of the enzyme or Nafion, and advanced synthesis reproducibility (40 times higher) in comparison to LbL analogues.

TI Benzene-1,4-Di(dithiocarboxylate) Linker-Based Coordination Polymers of
   Mn<SUP>2+</SUP>, Zn<SUP>2+</SUP>, and Mixed-Valence Fe<SUP>2+/3+</SUP>
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Three new coordination polymers (CPs) constructed from the linker 1,4-di(dithiocarboxylate) (BDDTC2-)-the sulfur-analog of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC2-)-together with Mn-, Zn-, and Fe-based inorganic SBUs are reported with description of their structural and electronic properties. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed structural diversity ranging from one-dimensional chains in [Mn(BDDTC)(DMF)(2)] (1) to two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb sheets observed for [Zn-2(BDDTC)(3)][Zn(DMF)(5)(H2O)] (2). Gas adsorption experiments confirmed a 3D porous structure for the mixed-valent material [Fe-2(BDDTC)(2)(OH)] (3). 3 contains a 1:1 ratio of Fe2+/3+ ions, as evidenced by Fe-57 Mossbauer, X-band EPR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Its empirical formula was established by elemental analysis, thermal gravimetric analysis, infrared vibrational spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy in lieu of elusive single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. In contrast to the Mn- and Zn-based compounds 1 and 2, the Fe2+/3+ CP 3 showed remarkably high electrical conductivity of 5 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) (according to van der Pauw measurements), which is within the range of semiconducting materials. Overall, our study confirms that sulfur derivatives of typical carboxylate linkers (e.g., BDC) are suitable for the construction of electrically conducting CPs, due to acceptedly higher covalency in metal-ligand bonding compared to the electrically insulating carboxylate CPs or metal-organic frameworks. At the same time, the direct comparison between insulating CPs 1 and 2 with CP 3 emphasizes that the electronic structure of the metal is likewise a crucial aspect to construct electrically conductive materials.

SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are considered as potential choice for future energy storage systems due to their adjustable chemistry, environment friendliness, and cost-effectiveness. In this study, structurally stabilized and aldehyde-tuned hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs-8) are designed and prepared to contain arrayed electronegative sites for sodium-ion storage. Benefitting from the flexible hydrogen bond and unique structural symmetry, HOFs-8 can achieve efficient utilization of the active sites and fast transport of sodium ions and electrons. The HOFs-8 electrode exhibits an impressive lifespan of 5000 cycles at 3.66 A g-1 (20 C). In situ Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ FT-IR) and ex situ X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ex situ XPS) analyses are performed to illustrate the mechanism of sodium-ion storage involving aldehyde-tuned CO. Additionally, flexible hydrogen bonds in HOFs materials with unique structural symmetries are investigated to elucidate the mechanism of hydrogen bonding for improving their electrochemical properties. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations verified that HOFs-8 has excellent Na+ diffusion kinetics, enabling it to demonstrate outstanding rate capability. This work offers insight into the design of new electrodes and improved HOFs, which are expected to have tremendous potential in energy storage systems.

   [Fe<SUP>II</SUP>(R-bik)3](BF4)2
   Complexes (R = Me, Et, Vinyl)
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The magnetic properties of three spin-crossover complexes, [Fe-II(R-bik)(3)](BF4)(2)center dot nH(2)O (1-3), based on bis(imidazolyl) ketone ligands, were investigated in solution and the solid state. Their properties were compared with those of the ketone-free analogue, [Fe-II(bim)(3)](OTf)(2) (4). The alkyl and vinyl R groups have weak influence on the transition temperature, T-1/2, in solution, while stronger differences are observed in the solid state, because different intermolecular interactions occur in 1-3. The spin-state equilibria in solution were followed by SQUID magnetometry and the Evans NMR spectroscopy method. Interestingly, the equilibria can also be simply and efficiently probed by following the temperature dependence of an adequately chosen H-1 chemical shift. Overall, these experiments give coherent results, with T-1/2 located between 320 and 335 K, a narrow range, in comparison with the solid state. DFT calculations have allowed the rationalization of the magnetic differences. The molecular-orbital and spin-density calculations reveal that the presence of the C=O group between the imidazolyl units in the ligands of 1-3 leads to an extended aromatic system, an effective pi-acceptor effect, stabilizing the LS state and reducing the LS-HS gap, in comparison with 4.

TI Effects of scandium doping on the electrochemical performance of cathode
   materials Na3MnTi(PO4)3 for sodium-ion batteries
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB A lately proposed NASICON-structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) provides a promising solution that enables a large theoretical specific capacity and a high voltage discharge platform. However, it encounters a difficulty in electronic conductivity which obstructs its further implements. Herein, in this work we propose the Sodium-ion battery cathode materials Na3Mn1_xScxTi(PO4)3/C with different Sc contents (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1), a potential cathode material for sodium-ion batteries with typical three-dimensional NASICON structure were synthesized by sol-gel method aiming to address the problem. Doping of Sc3+ in the NMTP structure was proved by powder X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. Impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique results suggest that appropriate-proportion doping has dramatically enhanced the electrical conductivity and Na ion migration of the NMTP matrix. Na3Mn0.95Sc0.05Ti(PO4)3 exhibited a higher initial discharge specific capacity (123 mA h /g at 0.2 C, 111 mA h /g at 1 C) and the highest cycling stability (capacity retention of 93% after 250cycles at 0.2 C, capacity retention of 88% after 500 cycles at 1 C). In addition, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction tests revealed the reasons for the improved cycling stability of the materials due to doping. Furthermore, Na3Mn0.95Sc0.05Ti(PO4)3//hard carbon full cells also demonstrates ideal electrochemical properties.

TI High Fe<SUP>LS</SUP>(C) electrochemical activity of an iron
   hexacyanoferrate cathode boosts superior sodium ion storage
SO CARBON ENERGY
AB Sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) is one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost theoretical capacity. However, the low electrochemical activity of Fe-LS(C) in FeHCF drags down its practical capacity and potential plateau. Herein, FeHCF with high Fe-LS(C) electrochemical activity (C-FeHCF) is synthesized via a facile citric acid-assisted solvothermal method. As the cathode of SIBs, C-FeHCF shows superior cycling stability (ca. 87.3% capacity retention for 1000 cycles at 10 C) and outstanding rate performance (ca. 68.5% capacity retention at 50 C). Importantly, the contribution of Fe-LS(C) to the whole capacity was quantitatively analyzed via combining dQ/dV and discharge curve for the first time, and the index reaches 44.53% for C-FeHCF, close to the theoretical value. In-situ X-ray diffraction proves the structure stability of C-FeHCF during charge-discharge process, ensuring its superior cycling performance. Furthermore, the application feasibility of the C-FeHCF cathode in quasi-solid SIBs is also evaluated. The quasi-solid SIBs with the C-FeHCF cathode exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 106.5 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and high capacity retention of 89.8% over 1200 cycles. This work opens new insights into the design and development of advanced cathode materials for SIBs and the beyond.

TI CN vacancy engineering in Quasi-PBA heterojunction enhances
   photo-synergistic peroxymonosulfate activation efficiency
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB The development of traditional photocatalysis and peroxymonosulfate activation is limited due to the stable removal and mineralization of mobile phase VOC, and the synergistic mechanism of the two processes is ignored. Quasi-CoFe PBA/g-C3N4 (H-CF PBA/g-C3N4) heterojunction was first designed and synthesized for the photocatalytic-enhanced PMS activation to degrade toluene. The construction of Quasi-Fe PBA with abundant CN vacancy increases the active metal site and enhances the light absorption and electron transport, promoting the synergistic effect. The built-in electric field between H-CoFe PBA and g-C3N4 further promotes efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. This synergy significantly boosts PMS activation, producing more reactive oxygen species and achieving efficient toluene mineralization. The H-CoFe PBA/g-C3N4 heterojunction achieved 91 % toluene degradation rate and 77 % mineralization rate, maintaining stability after five cycles, outperforming individual photocatalysis or PMS activation. Continuous-flow experiments revealed the feasibility of engineering applications. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that the synergistic catalytic system of heterojunction functional materials provides a new perspective for the removal of flowing-phase VOCs under low-temperature conditions.

TI Electron transfer and spin transition in metal-hexacyanoferrates driven
   by anatase TiO2: electronic and structural order effects
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy was used to highlight a charge transfer mechanism in cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) when synthetized in the presence of anatase TiO2. The electron transfer in TiO2-CoHCF composites along the Co-NC-Fe-CN-Co chain is confirmed by the unequivocal evolution of the typical quadrupole doublet of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in pristine CoHCF into the single line spectrum of the Fe(I) species when CoHCF is nanodispersed on TiO2 anatase. Parallel galvanostatic measurements also confirm the electron transfer mechanism induced by TiO2. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first examples of the triggering of spin-crossover phenomena in metal-hexacyanoferrate based-molecular solids by an external stimulus other than photoexcitation and most of all one of the first studies in which a completely pure low-spin Fe(II) is obtained starting from a mix of low-spin Fe(II) and Fe(III).

TI MOFs-derived defect carbon encapsulated magnetic metallic Co
   nanoparticles capable of efficiently activating PMS to rapidly degrade
   dyes
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, a new defect carbon encapsulated magnetic metallic Co nanoparticles (denoted as Co@DC) was prepared via pyrolyzing Co-BTC (BTC: 1,3,5-trimesic acid) MOFs precursor at 900 degrees C, and characterized by various technologies to prove that the Co@DC contains Co-0, Co2+ and Co3+. It was used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade Rhodamine B (RhB) dye efficiently. Over 99% of 10 mg/L RhB with initial pH of 5.5 was degraded by 100 mg/L PMS activated by 10 mg/L Co@DC within 5 min. The RhB degradation rate constant in the Co@DC/PMS system was 1.1805 min(-1), which was approximately 17 times that of DC/PMS system (0.0695 min(-1)). The Co@DC displayed a good magnetism, stability, and PMS activation ability in a wide pH range of 3 to 10. After four cycles, the RhB removal rate can still maintain over 90% after 10 min reaction. The Co@DC/PMS system can also rapidly degrade the other dyes (acid fuchsin, methylene blue and methyl orange), showing excellent universality. The free radical quenching experiments and EPR trials suggest that both the radicals (sulfate radical, hydroxyl radical, and O-2(center dot-)) and non-radical (singlet oxygen) species are involved in the RhB degradation, while the latter plays a major role. In addition to the cobalt ions, the metallic Co-0 also took part in PMS activation and reacted with O-2 to generate Co2+, ensuring the sufficient Co2+ to activate the PMS to produce Co3+. The Co3+ ions withdraw electrons from HSO5- or Co-0 in the Co@DC catalyst, driving a Co2+/Co3+ cycle to maintain a high performance of the Co@DC/PMS system for RhB removal. The effects of common inorganic anions on RhB removal, the mineralization degree and possible degradation pathway of RhB were studied. Relative to the previous catalysts for PMS activation to degrade RhB, the Co@DC shows lower activation energy of 23.78 KJ/mol. Altogether, this work provides a simple strategy to develop an efficiently magnetic heterogeneous catalyst to activate PMS for the elimination of hardly degradable dyes.

TI Wearable multiplexed biosensor system toward continuous monitoring of
   metabolites
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB Comprehensive metabolic panels are the most reliable and common methods for monitoring general physiology in clinical healthcare. Translation of this clinical practice to personal health and wellness tracking requires reliable, non-invasive, miniaturized, ambulatory, and inexpensive systems for continuous measurement of biochemical analytes. We report the design and characterization of a wearable system with a flexible sensor array for non-invasive and continuous monitoring of human biochemistry. The system includes signal conditioning, processing, and transmission parts for continuous measurement of glucose, lactate, pH, and temperature. The system can operate three discrete electrochemical cells. The system draws 15 mA under continuous operation when powered by a 3.7 V 150 mAh battery. The analog front-end of the electrochemical cells has four potentiostats and three multiplexers for multiplexed and parallel readout from twelve working electrodes. Utilization of redundant working electrodes improves the measurement accuracy of sensors by averaging chronoamperometric responses across the array. The operation of the system is demonstrated in vitro by simultaneous measurement of glucose and lactate, pH, and skin temperature. In benchtop measurements, the sensors are shown to have sensitivities of 26.31 mu A mM(-1).cm(-2) for glucose, 1.49 mu A mM(-1).cm(-2) for lactate, 54 mV.pH(-1) for pH, and 0.002 degrees C-1 for temperature. With the custom wearable system, these values were 0.84 +/- 0.03 mV mu M-1.cm(-2) or glucose, 31.87 +/- 9.03 mV mM(-1).cm(-2) for lactate, 57.18 1.43 mV.pH(-1) for pH, and 63.4 mu V.degrees C-1 for temperature. This miniaturized wearable system enables future evaluation of temporal changes of the sweat biomarkers.

TI Reversible photoswitchable ferromagnetic thin film based on a
   cyanido-bridged RbCuMo complex
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB A film-form cyanido-bridged RbCuMo complex (Rb3/2Cu7II)-Cu-I[Mo-IV(CN)(8)](31/8)center dot 12H(2)O (RbCuMo) was electrochemically prepared. RbCuMo has a tetragonal structure of I4/mmm, and Rb-I is intercalated in a cyanido-bridged Cu-Mo three-dimensional network. This film exhibits a paramagnetic behavior due to Cu-II (S = 1/2). Irradiating with 473 nm light (blue laser) induces a spontaneous magnetization with a Curie temperature (T-C) of 18 K. By contrast, irradiating the photoinduced state with 785 nm light (red laser) restores the initial paramagnetic state. The photoinduced phase transition is attributed to the change from Mo-IV (S = 0)-CN-Cu-II (S = 1/2) to Mo-V (S = 1/2)-CN-Cu-I (S = 0), which produces ferromagnetic long-range ordering between residual Cu-II (S = 1/2) and photoproduced Mo-V (S = 1/2). Although the Cs intercalated isomorph crystal lacks photoreversibility, RbCuMo shows a photoreversible phase transition. The reason for the photoreversibility in RbCuMo was investigated by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). In the THz absorption spectrum, a low-frequency phonon mode due to the vibrational mode of the intercalated Rb ion is observed at 1.11 THz (37 cm(-1)), which is lower than 1.35 THz (45 cm(-1)) of the Cs vibration mode in the Cs intercalated isomorph crystal, indicating that the Rb trapping force in RbCuMo is weaker than the Cs trapping force. The structure of RbCuMo is more flexible compared to the Cs intercalated isomorph crystal, which is considered to be the origin of the photoreversibility in RbCuMo. Such a photoreversible ferromagnetic film is useful for optical memories and photoswitchable Faraday devices.

TI Electrochemical performance of M(dca)2pyz (M = Fe, Co and Ni)
   MOFs as sustainable anodes in lithium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB A family of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) based on the ligands pyrazine (pyz) and dicyanamide (dca) and the metal centers Fe, Co and Ni with the unit formula M(dca)2pyz has been studied as anodes for Li-Ion Batteries (LIBs). These compounds are analogs of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) but synthesized following an environmentally friendly process. Fe(dca)2pyz provides the best electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 519 mA h g(-1) and 375 mA h cm(-3) after 450 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) and a capacity retention of 90% with respect to the first cycle. This performance is better than most of the Fe nitrides reported to date, highlighting its potential as an anode for LIBs. The high capacity is due to the conversion and displacement reaction occurring with the Fe atoms and the insertion of Li+ into the ligands. In contrast, the specific capacities of Co(dca)2pyz and Ni(dca)2pyz are lower due to a partial reduction of the Co atoms in the first case, and to the oxidation of the Ni atoms which hinders the Li+ intercalation process in the second. As a result, the specific capacities after 450 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) are 148 mA h g(-1) for Co(dca)2pyz and 57 mA h g(-1) for Ni(dca)2pyz. Powder-XRD and TEM characterizations after cycling of the three samples reveal that Fe(dca)2pyz and Co(dca)2pyz samples become amorphous while the Ni(dca)2pyz material does not. This suggests that the amorphization process is relevant for obtaining anodes with improved electrochemical performance. This study demonstrates that MOFs obtained by a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method can act as precursors for obtaining high performance anodes for LIBs without the need for an energy intensive carbonization process, since they undergo an in situ amorphization process, giving rise to AMorphous Organometallic (AMO) electrodes.

TI Dynamical Mechanical Analysis and Micromechanics Simulations of
   Spin-Crossover@Polymer Particulate Composites: Toward Soft Actuator
   Devices
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB We investigated the interplay between the thermome-chanical , spin-crossover (SCO) properties of a series of stimuli -responsive polymer composites consisting of [Fe(NH2trz)3]SO4 and [Fe(Htrz)(trz)2]BF4 particles (trz = 1,2,4-triazolato) embedded in thermoplastic polyurethane, TPU , poly(vinylidene fluoride- trifluoroethylene), P(VDF-TrFE), matrices. The effective thermoelastic coefficients and transformation stress and strain in the composites were assessed utilizing dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal expansion, and thermal stress measurements. Remarkably, the composites display a characteristic elastic softening and increased mechanical damping around the spin transition temperature, which arise from the significant spin state- volume strain coupling in the particles and scale semiquantitatively with the pressure derivative of the low spin fraction ( ) P n T. Crucially, for a given particle volume fraction, the transformation strain (respectively stress) substantially increases (respectively decreases) in soft matrices, which was rationalized by micromechanical simulations. The results provide a fundamental understanding and a quantitative guideline for the design of SCO@polymer composites for applications in mechanical transducers.

TI Effect of H2O Molecules on Thermal Expansion of
   TiCo(CN)6
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Understanding the role of guest molecules in the lattice void of open-framework structures is vital for tailoring thermal expansion. Here, we take a new negative thermal expansion (NTE) compound, TiCo(CN)(6), as a case study from the local structure perspective to investigate the effect of H2O molecules on thermal expansion. The in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction results showed that the as-prepared TiCo(CN)(6)center dot 2H(2)O has near-zero thermal expansion behavior (100-300 K), while TiCo(CN)(6) without water in the lattice void exhibits a linear NTE (alpha(1) = -4.05 x 10(-6 )K(-1),100-475 K). Combined with the results of extended X-ray absorption fine structure, it was found that the intercalation of H2O molecules has the clear effect of inhibiting transverse thermal vibrations of Ti-N bonds, while the effect on the Co-C bonds is negligible. The present work displays the inhibition mechanism of H2O molecules on thermal expansion of TiCo(CN)(6), which also provides insight into the thermal expansion control of other NTE compounds with open-framework structures.

TI Understanding Large Negative Thermal Expansion of NdFe(CN)6
   through the Electronic Structure and Lattice Dynamics
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB A large negative thermal expansion (NTE) (alpha v=-4.1x10-5K-1, 100-525 K) has been discovered in NdFe(CN)6.Here, the synchrotron X-ray diffraction and lattice dynamics calculations using the density functional theory were conducted tounderstand the NTE in NdFe(CN)6. The information obtained on the bond nature of the Nd-N???C-Fe linkage and on the atomicthermal vibrations suggests that the transverse vibrations of the-N???C-group, in particular from N atoms, produced the NTE inNdFe(CN)6. This is corroborated by the calculated Gru??neisen parameters, which confirm the relationship between NTE and CNatomic vibrations. The results provide a helpful contribution toward the realization of new materials with negative or controllablethermal expansion

TI Ni-Containing Electrolytes for Superior Zinc-Ion Aqueous Batteries with
   Zinc Hexacyanoferrate Cathodes
SO ACS OMEGA
AB A one-step coprecipitation process is designed to synthesize zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) cathodes in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). The morphology of the cathode is influenced by the concentration of the precursor solution and valence of iron ions. The rhombohedral ZnHCF sample exhibits high crystallinity on the microscale in the cut-angle cubic structure, whereas Na-rich NaZnHCF contains many interstitial water molecules in the rhombic nanoplates. Both samples show effective insertion of Zn ions in the aqueous ZnSO4 solution. ZnHCF shows a specific capacity of 66.7 mA h g(-1), a redox voltage of 1.73 V, and fast decline in a few cycles. On the other hand, NaZnHCF has a lower specific capacity of 48.2 mA h g(-1), showing two voltage platforms and robust cycling stability. However, owing to serious side reactions, both samples have low Columbic efficiency. To improve the properties such as Coulombic efficiency, specific capacity, and cycling stability, Ni ions are introduced by adding 10 wt % NiSO4 to the ZnSO4 electrolyte. The ZnHCF cathode in the Ni-containing electrolyte has the best properties such as a high specific capacity of 71.2 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), 93% retention of the Coulombic efficiency, and a good rate performance manifested by a reversible capacity of 58.2 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). The results reveal a strategy to improve the electrochemical properties of aqueous ZIBs by modifying the electrolytes.

TI Mechanochemical synthesis of Fe/Mn-based binary hexacyanoferrate for
   sodium-ion battery
SO POWDER TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, a facile one-pot two-step mechanochemical technology is firstly developed to prepare Fe/Mn-based binary hexacyanoferrates (Nax(FeMn)[Fe(CN)6]y, FeMnHCF)/carbon composites by coupling in-situ construction of the conductive network and solid-state reaction. It is found that construction of hierarchical conductive network is favorable to improve the rate performance and cycling stability, with an 80.5% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 360 mA/g. Furthermore, the capacity attenuation and stabilization mechanisms are inves-tigated by GITT, EIS, and ex-situ XRD. The capacity attenuation in the early stage can be attributed to the large charge transfer resistance, while in the latter stage the long cycling stability is ascribed to the solid solution reaction with the mitigated stress distortion during the desodiation/sodiation process. Overall, the proposed mechanochemical synthesis of Fe/Mn-based binary hexacyanoferrate shows great potential in environmental friendliness and cost-saving production as well as comprehensive product performance.

TI Electronic Communication in Luminescent Dicyanorhenate-Bridged
   Homotrinuclear Rhenium(I) Complexes
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB A series of cyano-bridged homotrinuclear Re(I) complexes with the general formula of {[Re]'[Re][Re]'}(+) {[Re]' = [Re-I(CO)(2)(LL)-(X)]; [Re] = -[(NC)Re-I(CO)(2)(phen)(CN)]-; LL = diimine, diphosphine, or two carbonyl ligands; X = triphenylphosphine or carbonyl ligand} and the corresponding mononuclear complex analogues were synthesized. The structures of most of the trinuclear Re(I) complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The relative orientations of peripheral to central Re(I) units in these structures vary considerably. The photophysical properties of these trinuclear Re(I) complexes have been examined. Except for the trinuclear Re(I) complex with Br(2)phen ligand, all the other triads display orange to red photoluminescence derived from the (MLCT)-M-3 [d pi(Re) -> pi*(phen)] origin of the central Re(I) unit, suggestive of efficient energy transfer between the peripheral chromophores and the central unit. In addition to the efficient energy transfer processes between the Re(I) chromophores in these trinuclear complexes, the ability of the [NC-Re-CN] bridging ligands for electronic coupling between the rhenium metal centers is evidenced by ca. 0.2-0.3 V separation of the two rhenium metal-based oxidation potentials of the chemically equivalent peripheral units.

TI Effect of Noble Metals on Luminescence and Single-Molecule Magnet
   Behavior in the Cyanido-Bridged Ln-Ag and Ln-Au (Ln = Dy, Yb, Er)
   Complexes
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Self-assembly of lanthanide(III) complexes of 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine (terpy) with dicyanidoargentate(I) and dicyanidoaurate(I) anions in water results in the formation of six isostructural dinuclear systems [Ln(III) (terpy)(H2O)(NO3)(2)]-[M-1(CN)(2)] (Ln(III)/M-1 = Dy/Ag, 1; Dy/Au, 2; Yb/Ag, 3; Yb/Au, 4; Er/Ag, 5; Er/Au, 6). They form three-dimensional supramolecular networks based on dinuclear molecules linked by hydrogen bonds, pi-pi interactions, and argentophilic (Ag center dot center dot center dot Ag) or aurophilic (Au center dot center dot center dot Au) interactions. All of the assemblies show complex solid-state strong UV and weak vis-NIR absorption due to overlapping contributions from 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine, dicyanidoargentate(I), dicyanidoaurate(I), and lanthanide(III) ions. Moreover, they exhibit excitation-wavelength-dependent multicolor photoluminescence ranging from bright white to blue via yellow, green, and cyan colors due to variable contributions from the dicyanidometalate and ligand. Assemblies 3-6 show NIR emission originating from Yb-III and Er-III metal centers. Furthermore, compounds 1-6 and their magnetically diluted samples are magnetic-field-induced single-molecule magnets with energy barriers of up to 35 K. The effect of noble metal substitution on the magnetic properties of particular lanthanide ions is described. The influence on the thermal anisotropic energy barrier, which relates to the strength of the magnetic anisotropy, depends on the type of lanthanide used. The Ag-to-Au substitution enhances the anisotropy of the prolate Yb-III ion and decreases it for the oblate Dy-III ion. It also modifies the strength of dipolar interactions affecting the slow magnetic relaxation processes.

TI Hexacyanoferrate-modified polyvinyl alcohol/graphene oxide aerogel as an
   efficient and retrievable adsorbent for cesium
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB While hexacyanoferrate and its analogues are specific adsorbents for elimination of cesium ions (Cs+), they seem to encounter a major challenge of separation from solution. To solve this difficulty, a novel aerogel adsorbent (polyvinyl alcohol/graphene oxide/KNi[Fe(CN)(6)], denoted as PVA/GO/KNi[Fe(CN)(6)]) was designed by a synergistic cross-linking reaction coupled with in situ precipitation strategy. PVA and Ni2+ firstly played synergistic roles in reinforcement of interwoven structure, and Ni2+ coordinated with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) to produce KNi[Fe(CN)(6)] in situ in the following step. Characterization analysis revealed a hierarchical structure of the aerogel composed of GO sheets and nanoparticles. This unique structure enhanced adsorption performance compared with PVA/GO. Results indicated that pseudo-second-order model (R-2 = 0.9971) and intraparticle diffusion model (R-2 = 1.000, 0.9959 and 0.8513) fitted the kinetic data well, suggesting that the rate-limiting step was governed by the chemisorption and diffusion mechanism. Isotherm data were better described by the Langmuir model (R-2 = 0.9970), indicating monolayer homogeneous adsorption. The structural investigation verified that the substitution of Cs+ for K+ (lattice) or for H+ (carboxyl groups) was the possible adsorption mechanism. The as-prepared adsorbent exhibited satisfactory adsorption capacity of 47.66 mg/g and a merit of easy separation (as a monolith aerogel) and may be taken as a potential candidate for Cs+ cleanup.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Magnetic properties of mixed spin (3/2, 1, 1/2) ferro-ferrimagnetic ternary alloys of the type A(y)(BxC1-x)(1-y) are investigated, by means of the Monte Carlo simulation. For this purpose, the influence of concentration, temperature and an external magnetic field on magnetization, magnetic hysteresis loop, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of ternary alloys with amorphous structures are examined. We found that the compensation temperature exists for some concentrations. Also, it is observed that these ferrimagnetic ternary alloys indicate double hysteresis loop which have been seen theoretically and experimentally in different magnetic alloys. The thermal behavior of magnetization, hysteresis loop and specific heat are also investigated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Optimizing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance by rationally
   constructing S-scheme heterojunction to modulate the D-band center
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The research in the field of photocatalysis has progressed, with the development of heterojunctions being recognized as an effective method to improve carrier separation efficiency in light-induced processes. In this particular study, CuCo2S4 particles were attached to a new cubic CdS surface to create an S-scheme heterojunction, thus successfully addressing this issue. Specifically, owing to the higher conduction band and Fermi level of CuCo2S4 compared to CdS, they serve as the foundation and driving force for the formation of an Sscheme heterojunction. Through in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis, the direction of charge transfer in the composite photocatalyst under light exposure was determined, confirming the charge transfer mechanism of the S-scheme heterojunction. By effectively constructing the Sscheme heterojunction, the d-band center of the composite photocatalyst was adjusted, reducing the energy needed for electron filling in the anti-bonding energy band, promoting the transfer of photogenerated carriers, and ultimately enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production. performance. After optimization, the hydrogen evolution activity of the composite photocatalyst CdS-C/CuCo2S4-3 reached 5818.9 mu mol g- 1h- 1, which is 2.6 times higher than that of cubic CdS (2272.3 mu mol g- 1h- 1) and 327.4 times higher than that of CuCo2S4 (17.8 mu mol g- 1h- 1), showcasing exceptional photocatalytic activity. Electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have established a theoretical basis for designing and constructing S-scheme heterojunctions, offering a viable method for adjusting the D-band center to enhance the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

TI The importance of bond covalency for the activation of multielectron
   reactions in phosphate cathodes for sodium-ion batteries
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Due to the uniform distribution of sodium in the crust, the increasing demand for high specific energy and long life in terms of energy storage is placing higher requests on sodium-ion battery technology. The activation of multi-electron reactions in NASICON sodium-ion battery cathode materials can not only reduce the use of vanadium, but also effectively increase the specific energy, therefore, it has received enormous attention from researchers. In this report, the importance of the covalent proportion of metal-oxygen bond in activating the V4+/V5+ redox with higher discharge voltage in Na3V2(PO4)(3) has been extensively studied. Advanced characterization methods and theoretical calculations comprehensively explain the effects of Zn2+, Mg2+, and Cu2+ on V3+ substitution and the corresponding electrochemical behavior and structural change behavior. Moreover, a complete two-phase reaction in the high voltage reaction region (3.88 V) was observed in Na3V1.5Cu0.5(PO4)(3). Our results highlight the importance of the covalent proportion of metal-oxygen bonds in activating multi-electron reactions in NASICON structures.

TI A general self-template-etched solution route for the synthesis of 2D
   γ-manganese sulfide nanoplates and their enhanced supercapacitive
   performance
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Electrode materials with two-dimensional (2-D) structures have attracted tremendous attention because they can exhibit many excellent electrochemical and chemical properties. Herein, we present a simple and general self-template-etched solution route to fabricate 2-D gamma-manganese sulfide (gamma-MnS) nanoplates using Mn-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) as a sacrificial template and Mn source. Detailed analysis and experimental results indicate that the ethylene glycol/H2O-assisted hydrothermal system and the unique metal frameworks are vitally important for the formation, structure, and morphology of plate-shaped g-MnS during the sulfidation process. By controlling the growth and etching process, a possible growth mechanism was proposed to interpret the formation of 2D gamma-MnS nanoplates. As a promising anode material for pseudocapacitors, the g-MnS nanoplate sample not only delivers a good specific capacity of 378 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and high rate capability in neutral solution, but it also displays an excellent stable performance, with only about 10% loss after continuous charge-discharge cycling for 4000 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1). The method appears to be a new way for using the sulfuration transformation matrix to obtain other two-dimensional transition metal compounds.

TI Fire-safe and mechanic-robust EP composites realized by cube-in-box
   hollow PBAs structure
SO POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY
AB As one of promising engineering plastics, epoxy resin (EP) has been a hot spot in various areas. Nevertheless, the further usage of EP has been challenged by the notorious problem of serious fire hazard. Here, we have utilized the strategies of epitaxial deposition and chemical transformation, acquiring the unique PBAs composites (Ni/Fe PBAs, Ni/Fe/Ni PBAs) and cube -in -box hollow PBAs structure (Ni/V/Ni PBAs). With the incorporations of 2.0 wt % Ni/Fe PBAs, Ni/Fe/Ni PBAs, Ni/V/Ni PBAs, the reductions of 28.0 %, 23.4 %, 31.1 % in peak heat release rate are discerned. At the same time, the decreases of 46.1 %, 20.4 %, 30.7 % in total smoke production are observed. The evidences for impaired releases of aromatic species, CO, NO gases are offered via Thermogravimetric analysis/infrared spectrometry (TG-IR) test. It is noteworthy that the catalytic oxidation effect of Ni/V/Ni PBAs facilitates the conversion of CO to CO2. In virtue of mechanical interlocking forces, the elevations in mechanical capabilities are observed. Overall, this research offers enlightenments on hollow structure engineering, upon the construction of EP with high safety.

TI Interface Engineering of Mo-doped Ni2P/FexP-V
   Multiheterostructure for Efficient Dual-pH Hydrogen Evolution and
   Overall Water Splitting
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Developing highly effective transition metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts remains a tremendously challenging task for large-scale overall water splitting. Herein, a multiheterostructured Mo-doped Ni2P/FexP electrocatalyst on NiFe foam with P vacancy (denoted as Mo & horbar;Ni2P/FexP-V/NFF) is developed to serve as an efficient dual-pH electrocatalyst. Due to the synergistic effect of multiple strategies (heteroatom doping, heterointerface, and P vacancy), the Mo & horbar;Ni2P/FexP-V/NFF possesses remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity in alkaline/acidic and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, along with encouraging durability. The mechanisms of improved electrocatalytic activity combining multicharacterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are elucidated. Specifically, X-ray absorption fine structure experimental analysis confirms that the Mo doping can optimize the electronic structure of electrocatalyst. In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the evolved oxyhydroxides are the real active substances for the OER. DFT calculations reveal that the conductivity of as-prepared samples can be enhanced through multiple strategy synergy. Moreover, in the HER process, multiple strategies can not only reduce the hydrogen binding energy to near zero but also enhance the H2O dissociation and *OH desorption. In the OER process, DFT calculations also verify that Mo doping and interface engineering can optimize the adsorption of the rate-determining step, achieving the lowest theoretical overpotential.

TI Chemically Chargeable Photo Battery
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Here we show a surrogate strategy for power production, wherein light is used to actuate a discharge Chemistry in the cathode of an aqueous rechargeable battery (ARB). The proposed photo battery consists of a titaninm nitride photoanode, promising. cathode:material iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II) as the battery active species, and Na2S2O8 as the chemical charging agent The photo battery delivered negligible capacity in the dark and the capacity shot up to 77.8 mAh/g when artificially shined light, confirming that the battery chemistry is light driven. In the ambient light, the device retained 72% of its artificial light discharge capacity with a stable cycling for more than 100 cycles. Further, an unprecedented means for charging the battery rapidly is presented using Na2S2O8 and it revitalized the battery in 30 s without any external bias. This methodology of expending a photoanode extends to a battery that is free from dissolution of active materials, irreversible structural changes, spontaneous deinsertion reactions, and safety concerns commonly encountered in the state of the art anode materials in ARBs. Apart from bringing out a sustainable way for power production, this device opens up avenues for charging the battery in the likely events of electrical input unavailability, while solving the critcial issues of longer charging time and higher charging voltage.

TI Interior engineering of seaweed-derived N-doped versatile carbonaceous
   beads with CoxOy for universal
   organic pollutant degradation
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The rational optimization of catalytic composites with excellent catalytic activities and long-term cycling stabilities for environmental remediation is still maintained as highly desired but is an ongoing challenge. Here, seaweed-derived N-doped versatile carbonaceous beads with CoxOy (Co-NC-0.25-700 degrees C) are employed as a novel catalyst to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for methylene blue (MB) degradation. Profiting from the improved structure-activity relationship and the synergistic effects between the "egg-box" structure and the CoxOy loaded on the N-doped carbonaceous beads, Co-NC-0.25-700 degrees C exhibited relatively high performance and comparative long-term stability. The universal applicability of Co-NC-0.25-700 degrees C was investigated by degrading other types of organic pollutants in various systems. For this type of newly fabricated high-performance versatile composites, structure-property relationships were plausibly proposed. Notably, the degradation efficiency and the catalyst structure could be tailored by the amount of polyethyleneimine (PEI) introduced in the preparation process and by the pyrolysis temperature. More favorably, the coupling of the magnetic properties and bead-like shape endows the resultant composites with remarkable reusability and recyclability, as compared to powder state materials. Another interesting finding is that MB degradation over Co-NC-0.25-700 degrees C is minimally affected by common ions (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, etc.), and holds a certain catalytic activity under the background conditions of two simulated real water conditions (running water and seawater). Of particular interest, a microreactor filled with Co-NC-0.25-700 degrees C was utilized as a verification model for practical applications of the reaction in continuous-flow. More far-reaching, the simulations of actual water conditions and the design of a continuous-flow reactor represent a giant step towards universal applications for organic pollution treatment.

TI Interior-Confined Vacancy in Potassium Manganese Hexacyanoferrate for
   Ultra-Stable Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) are viewed as promising cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) because of their high theoretical capacities and redox potentials. However, the development of an HCF cathode with high cycling stability and voltage retention is still impeded by the unavoidable Fe(CN)(6) vacancies (V-FeCN) and H2O in the materials. Here, we propose a repair method that significantly reduces the VFeCN content in potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) enabled by the reducibility of sodium citrate and removal of ligand H2O at high temperature (KMHCF-H). The KMHCF-H obtained at 90(degrees)C contains only 2% V-FeCN, and the V-FeCN is concentrated in the lattice interior. Such an integrated Fe-CN-Mn surface structure of the KMHCF-H cathode with repaired surface V-FeCN allows preferential decomposition of potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in the electrolyte, which constitutes a dense anion-dominated cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) , inhibiting effectively Mn dissolution into the electrolyte. Consequently, the KMHCF-H cathode exhibits excellent cycling performance for both half-cell (95.2 % at 0.2 Ag-1 after 2000 cycles) and full-cell (99.4 % at 0.1 Ag-1 after 200 cycles). This thermal repair method enables scalable preparation of KMHCF with a low content of vacancies, holding substantial promise for practical applications of PIBs.

TI Critical Role of Nonrigid Unit and Spiral Acoustical Modes in Designing
   Colossal Negative Thermal Expansion
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Exploring the relationship between thermal expansion and structural complexity is a challenging topic in the study of modern materials where volume stability is required. This work reports a new family of negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, AM(CN)(4) with A = Li and Na and M = B, Al, Ga, and In. Here, the compounds of LiB(CN)(4) and NaB(CN)(4) were only synthesized; others were purely computationally studied. A critical role of nonrigid vibrational modes and spiral acoustical modes has been identified in NaB(CN)(4). This understanding has been exploited to design the colossal NTE materials of NaM(CN)(4) (M = Al, Ga, In). A joint study involving synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations has been conducted to investigate the thermal expansion mechanism. It has been found that the A atoms can either increase the symmetry of the crystal structure, inducing stronger NTE, or lower the crystal symmetry, thus resulting in positive thermal expansion. Conversely, the M-site atoms do not affect the crystal structure. However, as the radius of the M atoms increases, the ionic nature of the C-M bonds strengthens and the CN vibrations become more flexible, thereby enhancing the NTE behavior. This study provides new insights to aid in the discovery and design of novel NTE materials and the control of thermal expansion.

TI A reagent-based label free electrochemiluminescence biosensor for
   ultrasensitive quantification of low-abundant chloramphenicol
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Today, great attentions have been attracted on chloramphenicol (CAP) to its nonnegligible biotoxicity to human. It is most important and urgent to quantify the low -abundant chloramphenicol by generating simple and efficient analysis approach for the detection of chloramphenicol. Herein, we proposed a novel reagent -based label free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on AuNPs@CoFe-PBA nanomaterials as highly efficient catalysts for luminol/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) system and target indirectly induced activation of the CRISPR/Cas 12a amplification system for simple and efficient quantification of the low -abundant chloramphenicol. Typically, AuNPs@CoFe-PBA nanomaterials as a novel catalyst for luminol/H2O2 system were enclosed in the X -type DNA hydrogel to greatly inhibit their catalytic performance due to the blocking effect of DNA hydrogel. In presence of target CAP, it induced DNA structure transformation of the aptamer of chloramphenicol to generate a toehold to present catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) amplification with the help of two self -designed hairpin structure DNA to perform the hybridizer of the two hairpins, which could activate the CRISPR/Cas 12a system to carry out the DNA cleavage. Its activity breaks the structure of DNA hydrogels and releases AuNPs@CoFe-PBA nanomaterials, which enhances the ECL signals of the luminol/H2O2 systems for simple and sensitive analysis of chloramphenicol. Most importantly, all of the target induced amplifications were performed in the detection solution and the ECL reactions were generated on the bare electrode without any modification to construct a reagent -based label -free analysis system simply with high efficiency for quantification of the low -abundant chloramphenicol. The results showed that there was a good linear relationship between ECL intensity and CAP concentration in range from 10 pg/mL to 1 ug/mL with a detection limit of 7.75 pg/mL, providing great potentials to quantify the low -abundant chloramphenicol and some other biomarkers for early disease diagnosis, food safety testing and environmental analysis.

TI The Peroxidase-like Nanocomposites as Hydrogen Peroxide-Sensitive
   Elements in Cholesterol Oxidase-Based Biosensors for Cholesterol Assay
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL BIOMATERIALS
AB Catalytically active nanomaterials, in particular, nanozymes, are promising candidates for applications in biosensors due to their excellent catalytic activity, stability and cost-effective preparation. Nanozymes with peroxidase-like activities are prospective candidates for applications in biosensors. The purpose of the current work is to develop cholesterol oxidase-based amperometric bionanosensors using novel nanocomposites as peroxidase (HRP) mimetics. To select the most electroactive chemosensor on hydrogen peroxide, a wide range of nanomaterials were synthesized and characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry. Pt NPs were deposited on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in order to improve the conductivity and sensitivity of the nanocomposites. The most HRP-like active bi-metallic CuFe nanoparticles (nCuFe) were placed on a previously nano-platinized electrode, followed by conjugation of cholesterol oxidase (ChOx) in a cross-linking film formed by cysteamine and glutaraldehyde. The constructed nanostructured bioelectrode ChOx/nCuFe/nPt/GCE was characterized by CV and chronoamperometry in the presence of cholesterol. The bionanosensor (ChOx/nCuFe/nPt/GCE) shows a high sensitivity (3960 A & BULL;M-1 & BULL;m(-2)) for cholesterol, a wide linear range (2-50 & mu;M) and good storage stability at a low working potential (-0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl). The constructed bionanosensor was tested on a real serum sample. A detailed comparative analysis of the bioanalytical characteristics of the developed cholesterol bionanosensor and the known analogs is presented.

TI Stepwise chemical oxidation to access ultrathin metal (oxy)-hydroxide
   nanosheets for the oxygen evolution reaction
SO NANOSCALE
AB Incorporation of ultrathin nanosheets with dopants/defects shows great potential to enable metal (oxy)-hydroxide electrocatalysts with enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance via the regulation of atomic structure and bonding arrangements. However, it remains challenging in synthesis especially for such dual control and at large scale. In this study, we present a stepwise chemical oxidation route, involving phase transition and reconstruction processes, to access ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets with a thickness of ca. 4 nm and abundant oxygen vacancies. Other transition metals were also doped into CoOOH nanosheets through this strategy. Among them, the optimized FeCoOOH nanosheets demonstrated an efficient OER activity with overpotential as low as 252 mV (current density: 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability. A high and stable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 10.5% was acquired when FeCoOOH nanosheets were used as the anode in a constructed water splitting device driven by solar energy. This study offers a noble and facile strategy for potentially scalable preparation of atom-modulated ultrathin metal (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets, and also demonstrates the OER applications.

TI Na3MnTi(PO4)3/C Nanofiber Free-Standing
   Electrode for Long-Cycling-Life Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Self-standing Na3MnTi(PO4)(3)/carbon nanofiber (CNF) electrodes are successfully synthesized by electrospinning. A pre-synthesized Na3MnTi(PO4)(3) is dispersed in a polymeric solution, and the electrospun product is heat-treated at 750 degrees C in nitrogen flow to obtain active material/CNF electrodes. The active material loading is 10 wt%. SEM, TEM, and EDS analyses demonstrate that the Na3MnTi(PO4)(3) particles are homogeneously spread into and within CNFs. The loaded Na3MnTi(PO4)(3) displays the NASICON structure; compared to the pre-synthesized material, the higher sintering temperature (750 degrees C) used to obtain conductive CNFs leads to cell shrinkage along the a axis. The electrochemical performances are appealing compared to a tape-casted electrode appositely prepared. The self-standing electrode displays an initial discharge capacity of 124.38 mAh/g at 0.05C, completely recovered after cycling at an increasing C-rate and a coulombic efficiency >= 98%. The capacity value at 20C is 77.60 mAh/g, and the self-standing electrode exhibits good cycling performance and a capacity retention of 59.6% after 1000 cycles at 1C. Specific capacities of 33.6, 22.6, and 17.3 mAh/g are obtained by further cycling at 5C, 10C, and 20C, and the initial capacity is completely recovered after 1350 cycles. The promising capacity values and cycling performance are due to the easy electrolyte diffusion and contact with the active material, offered by the porous nature of non-woven nanofibers.

TI High-voltage K/Zn dual-ion battery with 100,000-cycles life using
   zero-strain ZnHCF cathode
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Rechargeable zinc-based batteries (RZBs) using low-cost zinc metal anodes are feasible for large-scale energy storage, but the developments currently are restricted by the poor performances. Here we constructed a particular dual-ion battery (DIB) based on zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) cathode, zinc metal anode, and non-aqueous K+/Zn2+ hybrid ions electrolyte. It was revealed that K+-ions occupied almost all the cavities in ZnHCF at high voltage over 1.7 V (vs. Zn2+/Zn), which effectively blocked Zn2+-ions insertion. The ZnHCF showed a zero-strain characteristic during the repeated K+-ions intake/removal. Meanwhile, the charge screening effect of additive K+-ions on optimizing the zinc electrodeposition process ensured the reversible and dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping. The DIBs demonstrated excellent rate performances (57 and 47 mAh g(cathode)(-1) at 2000 and 5000 mA g(-1), respectively) and incredibly 100,000-cycles life with 74% capacity retention.

TI Built-in Electric Field Within CoSe2-FeSe2
   Heterostructure for Enhanced Sulfur Reduction Reaction in Li-S Batteries
SO SMALL
AB The conversion of Li2S4 to Li2S is the most important and slowest rate-limiting step in the complex sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) for Li-S batteries, the adjustment of which can effectively inhibit the notorious "shuttle effect". Herein, a CoSe2-FeSe2 heterostructure embedded in 3D N-doped nanocage as a modified layer on commercial separator is designed (CoSe2-FeSe2@NC//PP). The CoSe2-FeSe2 heterostructure forms a built-in electric field at the two-phase interface, which leads to the optimized adsorption force on polysulfides and the accelerated reaction kinetics for Li2S4-Li2S evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results combine to show that the liquid-solid reaction (Li2S4-Li2S2/Li2S) is significantly enhanced in terms of thermodynamics and electrodynamics. Consequently, the batteries assembled with CoSe2-FeSe2@NC//PP delivered an excellent rate capability (606 mAh g(-1) under 8.0 C) and a long cycling lifespan (only 0.056% at 1.0 C after 1000 cycles). In addition, the cells can provide high initial capacity of 887 mAh g(-1) at sulfur loading of 5.8 mg cm(-2) and 0.1 C. This work would provide valuable insights into binary metal selenide heterostructures for liquid-solid conversion in Li-S batteries.

TI A Strategy to Mitigate Jahn Teller Effect of Mn-Rich NASICON Framework
   for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Mn-based sodium superionic conductors have driven attention to the low-cost advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, low-rate capability and unsatisfactory cyclic performance due to the Jahn teller effect of Mn3+ redox couple which occurs from the change in Mn-O bond length at the octahedral site of crystal structure during charge-discharge, eventually limiting their application. Herein, a disordered and sodium deficient NASICON Na4-xMn(FeVCrTi)0.25(PO4)3 (termed as Na4-xMn(HE)) is synthesized to mitigate this Jahn teller effect to achieve high rate and ultrastable cathode material. Interestingly, the as-prepared Na3.5Mn(HE) shows five reversible electron reactions (i.e., Ti3+/Ti4+, Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, Mn2+/Mn3+, and Mn3+/Mn4+) and demonstrates 141 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C with 80% capacity retention at 1 C after 500 cycles which is far superior to its counterparts binary Mn-based materials. The excellent cyclic performance is due to the remediation of the Jahn teller effect in sodium-deficient entropy-stabilized material. The structural reversibility, enhanced kinetics, and electronic properties are further studied in detail by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and first principal calculations. Na3.5Mn(HE)//HC full cell delivered 89.7 mAh g-1 capacity at 0.2 C. This work sheds light on designing Mn-based cathodes with superior electrochemical performance for wide energy storage applications.
   Mn-based NASICON has attracted tremendous attention as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. Herein, sodium-deficient entropy stabilized Mn-rich NASICON is synthesized to mitigate the Jahn-Teller effect for high rate and long cyclic performance. This study has great significance in exploring advanced Mn-based low-cost cathode materials for SIBs. image

TI Electrochemically Active Mn-Doped Iron Hexacyanoferrate as the Cathode
   Material in Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB In this work, for the performance enhancement of iron hexacyanoferrate, an electrochemically active Mn-doped iron hexacyanoferrate cathode is fabricated via a bottom-up approach. It is found that the pre-treatment of interstitial water and appropriate Mn doping are two keys to achieving higher capacity and higher stability. The interstitial water has a trade-off effect between the alleviation of volume expansion upon Na+ (de)intercalation and the retardation of Na-ion diffusion. The moisture-tailored iron hexacyanoferrate with appropriate Mn doping exhibits a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.8%, enhanced capacity and rate performance, and excellent cycling stability. These results benefit from the fact that the extraction/insertion of Na ions from/into the lattice via a solid-solution mechanism correspond to both the slight volume expansion and fast sodium diffusion rate; otherwise, the removal of interstitial water and a higher Mn content might lead to poor cycling stability due to excessive volume expansion resulting from rhombohedral to cubic phase transformation. Finally, the less demand on the control of air humidity for the fabrication of electrodes and the potential for the full cell coupled with hard carbon are also demonstrated, which shows great potential for practical applications.

TI Rechargeable sodium-ion battery based on a cathode of copper
   hexacyanoferrate
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB In this work, the performance of copper (II) hexacyanoferrate(III) (CuHCF) as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries was studied. The compound was synthesized by a precipitation reaction in aqueous solution in a closed system. The morphology and structure show nanoparticles agglomerated with sizes ranging between 40 and 70 nm and a crystalline phase with a cubic structure, respectively. The material exhibited a stable performance with a working potential of around 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na. The gravimetric capacity obtained is close to 30 mAh g(-1) for 100 cycles at a rate of C/20, which is around half of the capacity for CuHCF when it encounters water in its structure, e.g., zeolite-type (60 mAh g(-1)), which is less than the theoretical capacity for this material (85.1 mAh g(-1)). CuHCF could be a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries considering its electrochemical performance.

TI Monte Carlo study of ternary alloy magnetic nanoparticle in presence of
   time dependent magnetic field
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB In the present work, we have studied the magnetic behavior of a ternary alloy nanoparticle of the form AB(p)C(1-p) by Monte Carlo simulations. The nanoparticle was modeled by three types of magnetic sites, A-sites with spin-3/2, B-sites with spin-1 and C-sites with spin-5/2, distributed in a simple cubic lattice. The magnetic behavior was modeled by means of a Hamiltonian including ferromagnetic coupling between the A and B sites and antiferromagnetic coupling between the A and C sites, in presence of a time dependent magnetic field. We have observed the nanoparticle radius dependence of the critical temperature. We have also computed the saturation magnetization for different values of p and compare it with the theoretical value. On the other hand, dynamic phase transitions were computed for different period and amplitude values of the time dependent magnetic field. Furthermore, dynamic hysteresis loops were obtained in order to calculate the specific absorption rate, which was found to exhibit an exponential decay as the field period increases. Finally, in all the cases, the specific absorption rate was found to be higher for high values of p. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Unraveling the role of unpaired 3d electrons in eg orbital of
   CoO: Driving π feedback of N2 for efficient ammonia
   electrosynthesis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been emerged as efficient electrocatalysts for ammonia (NH3) electrosynthesis. However, the relationship between the d electron configuration of TMOs and their catalytical activity needs to be deeply understood towards for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR). Herein, we focused on illustrating the effect of orbital occupation/distribution of d electrons on the ENRR performance of Cobalt oxides by deliberately selecting CoO (with a t(2)(5)ge(g)(2) electron configuration of Co2+) and Co2O3 (with a t(2)(6)ge(g)(0) electron configuration of Co3+) as modeling catalysts. Interestingly, the CoO catalyst exhibited a high ammonia yield of 33.46 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) at -0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a prominent faradic efficiency (FE) of 5.1%, which apparently outperforms the Co2O3 catalyst. We used XAS, M-T and MFM to thoroughly characterize the electronic structure of the active center of the samples. Importantly, Theoretical calculations and In-situ techniques demonstrated that the unpaired electrons in eg orbital of Co2+ play crucial role in boosting the adsorption and activation of N-2 on CoO. In specific, the t(2)(5)ge(g)(2) electron configuration delivers more electron from Co2+ to N-2 and the unpaired electrons in e(g) orbital of Co2+ site promote surprisingly the p-feedback process from CoO to N-2, resulting a lower hydrogenation energy barrier for N-2 activation. This work provides a deep understanding of the structure-function relationship of TMOs catalyst for ENRR.

TI LnFeO3 (Ln=La, Nd, Sm) derived from bimetallic organic
   frameworks for gas sensor
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Recently, perovskite-type oxides have been reported to have outstanding gas sensing performance. However, facile synthesis of uniform materials with controllable morphologies and low limit of detection are still great challenges. In this paper, the synthesis of Ln[Fe(CN)(6)] (Ln=La, Nd, Sm) with novel morphologies was achieved by introducing polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) in dilute water/alcohol solutions to induce and regulate crystal growth using a co-precipitation method at room temperature. Then, the oxygen-vacancy rich LnFeO(3) materials were obtained by high-temperature annealing. Among them, LaFeO3-based sensor has a low detection limit of 1 ppm n-propanol with a gas-sensing response of 2.5 at a relatively low operating temperature of 120 degrees C. In addition, by analyzing the influence of Ln(3+) on the morphology and crystal structure of LnFeO(3), the reasons for the better gas-sensing performance of LaFeO3-based sensor compared with that of the sensors based on NdFeO3 and SmFeO3 are expounded. This simple method of preparing porous LnFeO(3) can be extended to the preparation of other ABO(3)-type gas-sensing materials using in trace detection. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Pillar Effect of Large-Size Alkaline Ions on the Electrochemical
   Stability of Sodium Manganese Hexacyanoferrate for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnHCF) is an attractive candidate as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost and high energy density. However, its practical application is hindered by poor electrochemical stability caused by the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn and the unstable structure of NaMnHCF. Here, this paper aims to address this issue by introducing highly stable AMnHCF (where A = K, Rb, or Cs) through a facile method to composite with NaMnHCF. The findings reveal that all AMnHCFs have a "pillar effect" on the crystal structure of NaMnHCF. It is observed that the degree of pillar effect varies depending on the specific AMnHCF used. The less electrochemically inactive the alkaline ion is and the greater the degree of compositing with NaMnHCF, the more dramatic the pillar effect. KMnHCF shows limited pillar effect due to its rough composition with NaMnHCF and the loss of K+ upon (de)intercalation. RbMnHCF has lower electrochemical activity and can be better composited with NaMnHCF. On the other hand, CsMnHCF exhibits the strongest pillar effect due to the inactivation of Cs+ and the excellent coherent structure formed by CsMnHCF and NaMnHCF. This research provides a new perspective on stabilizing NaMnHCF with other alkaline elements.
   A systematic study on the effects of A+ (A = K, Rb and Cs) on the stability of sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnHCF) is conducted. The research implies that the larger ions can act as pillars to enhance the stability of NaMnHCF during cycling. The electrochemical inactivity of A+ and the structural compatibility of AMnHCF with NaMnHCF determine the degree of the pillar effect. image

TI MnO2 cathode materials with high reversible stability through Li
   intercalating for aqueous zinc ion battery
SO SOLID STATE IONICS
AB Manganese oxides have been paid attention to storage energy with low price, high safety and environmentally friendly. Nevertheless, poorly cycling stability and low structure stability restrict their appliance. The metal doping is a potential method to enhance their electrochemical performance. Herein, a new strategy was proposed to optimize the cycling stability and rate performance of the pristine MnO2 by the simple lithium doped. The Li -doped MnO2 (Li-MnO2) not only relieved the manganese dissolution during charge-discharge process but also introduced oxygen defects boosting the electrochemical kinetics of MnO2. The prepared composite delivers a reversible specific capacity of 185 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 88 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1, maintaining 88% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. This work may provide some new ideas for improving the stability of manganese -based zinc-ion batteries.

TI Low-Cost, High-Performance Sample Cell for X-Ray Spectroscopy of
   Solutions and Gels Made from Plastic Straw
SO ANALYTICAL SCIENCES
AB Low-cost tube-type sample cells for X-ray spectroscopy of solutions, sols, and gels were made from plastic straws. Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) experiments showed that the X-ray transparency of the straw cells is similar to 50% superior to that of quartz capillary cells for 6 - 7 keV XRF and is almost uniform over the entire range, allowing its use for position-dependent measurements. Wavelength-dispersive XRF experiments showed that the difference in the surface curvature between the straw cells and pellet samples leads to an apparent similar to 1.5 eV shift of the Fe K beta(1,3) peak; however, chemical effects of Fe K beta(1,3) spectra can be studied if all the samples (including standards) are evenly set in the straw cells. Additionally, the application of the straw cell in studying precipitation band formation in gels was shown on two gel samples containing 0.004 M [Fe(CN)(6)](3-)/[Fe(CN)(6)](2-) in 2 mass% kappa-carrageenan and 0.040 M Fe2+/Fe3+ in 1 mass% agarose, respectively.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We have investigated the local Fe electronic changes in the square planar Fe(II) compound SrFeO2 by x-ray emission (XES) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) through the pressure-induced spin transition up to 60 GPa. The analysis of Fe K beta XES confirms the transition under pressure from a high spin to intermediate spin state at P-c = 43 GPa while XAS at the Fe K edge reveals the spectral signatures of the lattice compression under pressure. Simulations of the XAS spectra point to significant changes in Fe-p states across P-c and highlight the active role of the Sr-p states at the transition.

TI A Rocking-chair Rechargeable Seawater Battery
SO RESEARCH
AB Seawater batteries are attracting continuous attention because seawater as an electrolyte is inexhaustible, eco-friendly, and free of charge. However, the rechargeable seawater batteries developed nowadays show poor reversibility and short cycle life, due to the very limited electrode materials and complicated yet inappropriate working mechanism. Here, we propose a rechargeable seawater battery that works through a rocking-chair mechanism encountered in commercial lithium ion batteries, enabled by intercalation-type inorganic electrode materials of open-framework-type cathode and Na-ion conducting membrane-type anode. The rechargeable seawater battery achieves a high specific energy of 80.0 Wh/kg at 1,226.9 W/kg and a high specific power of 7,495.0 W/kg at 23.7 Wh/kg. Additionally, it exhibits excellent cycling stability, retaining 66.3% of its capacity over 1,000 cycles. This work represents a promising avenue for developing sustainable aqueous batteries with low costs.

   {Fe2Co2} square complex followed by X-ray
   diffraction and absorption techniques
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB The switching properties of a cyanido-bridged Fe/Co square molecule were investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy at both Fe and Co K-edges. Combining these two techniques, a complete picture of the thermal-, light- and X-ray-induced metal-to-metal electron transfer is obtained, illustrating the concerted role played by the Fe and Co sites.

TI Topotactic Epitaxy Self-Assembly of Potassium Manganese Hexacyanoferrate
   Superstructures for Highly Reversible Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS NANO
AB The cycle stability and voltage retention of a Na2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] (NMF) cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has been impeded by the huge distortion from NaMnII[FeIII(CN)(6)] to MnIII[FeIII(CN)(6)] caused by the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect of Mn3+. Herein, we propose a topotactic epitaxy process to generate K2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] (KMF) submicron octahedra and assemble them into octahedral superstructures (OSs) by tuning the kinetics of topotactic transformation. As the SIB cathode, the self-assembly behavior of KMF improves the structural stability and decreases the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby inhibiting the transition metal in the KMF cathode from dissolving in the electrolyte. More importantly, the KMF partly transforms into NMF with Na+ de/intercalation, and the existing KMF acts as a stabilizer to disrupt the longrange JT order of NMF, thereby suppressing the overall JT distortion. As a result, the electrochemical performances of KMF cathodes outperform NMF with a highly reversible phase transition and outstanding cycling performance, and 80% capacity retention after 1500/1300 cycles at 0.1/0.5 A g(-1). This work not only promotes creative synthetic methodologies but also promotes to explore the relationship between Jahn-Teller structural deformation and cycle stability.

TI Tailoring the growth of iron hexacyanoferrates for high-performance
   cathode of sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) is regarded as a promising cathode material of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the merits of easy preparation, low cost and three-dimensional open framework. However, the practical application of FeHCF is highly restricted by the intrinsic [Fe(CN)6]4-vacancy and coordinated water as well as nanoscale particles. Herein, sodium citrate is introduced to mediate the drawbacks of FeHCF, resulting in microscale particles with less water content. Accordingly, the modified sample, FeHCF-3, achieved the performance of 92 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and 80 % capacity retention after 300 cycles. Furthermore, an optimal iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF-H-2) with high-salt-concentration preparation is designed and performs a good reversibility of 96 mA h g-1 after 700 cycles at 100 mA g-1. Such strategy may drive the application of high-tap, low-defect and stable cathode for SIBs.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate with improved lifespan in
   Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte for aqueous
   zinc-ion batteries
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Aqueous rechargeable Zn ion batteries (ARZIBs) attract intensive attention in grid-scale energy storage applications due to their low cost and high safety. Searching for suitable cathode materials is an important issue for the development of ARZIBs. In this work, we investigate the electrochemical behavior of potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate in zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) and zinc triflate (Zn(OTf)(2)) aqueous electrolytes. KMHCF undergoes severe dissolution and zinc displacement during cycling. Compared to ZnSO4, the anions of Zn(OTf)(2) electrolyte are strongly adsorbed on the electrode surface, in turn hindering the water oxidation reaction and reducing the decomposition of KMHCF. The KMHCF/Zn battery using 3m Zn(OTf)(2) delivers a specific capacity of 123.8 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) and excellent capacity retention of 90% over 500 cycles at 250 mA g(-1). Our results suggest that the anions in the aqueous electrolyte are of great importance to optimize the electrochemical performance of metal hexacyanoferrates.

TI Wide interlayer spacing ammonium vanadate
   (NH4)0.37V2O5.0.15(H2</
   sub>O) cathode for rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY
AB Recently, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have been gaining widespread academic interest in the energy-storage field owing to their high energy density, enhanced safety of electrochemical operation, and low cost, as well as the abundance of zinc on earth. The ammonium vanadate group contains compounds that are considered efficient energy-storage materials because they provide twodimensional (2D) layered structures with large interlayer distances that promote the intercalation of metal ions during electrochemical processes. Here, we report a hydrated form of ammonium vanadate (NH4)(0.37)V2O5.0.15(H2O) with a highly crystalline rose-like microstructure, which is used as the positive electrode material in AZIBs. The ammonium vanadate cathode delivered an initial capacity of 400 mA h g(-1) with 2 M ZnSO4 at the current density of 0.5 Ag-1 in a voltage range from 0.2 V to 1.4 V vs Zn2+/Zn. At a higher current density (10 A g(-1)), the material retained 84% of the initial discharge capacity after 1000 cycles, while displaying an excellent rate capability. Cyclic voltammetry and ex-situ XRD and XPS are used to study the reaction mechanism of ammonium vanadate cathode in the AZIBs. Unlike other ammonium vanadate's, (NH4)(0.37)V2O5.0.15(H2O) undergoes co-intercalation of Zn2+ and H+ along with water molecules. There is no intermediate irreversible crystal phase formation during the discharge/charge cycles due to expandable interlaying distance. This report suggests that (NH4)(0.37)V2O5.0.15(H2O) can be an alternative highly stable cathode material for use in AZIBs, and it can be promising for the intercalation of the cathode in larger-sized metal-ion storage systems.

TI Gradient doping-induced triphasic intergrowth hexacyanoferrate cathode
   for high-performance sodium-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB As a high-capacity, high-voltage, and low-cost cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), Na/Mn-based hexacyanoferrates (NaxMn[Fe(CN)(6)](1-y)center dot square(y)center dot nH(2)O) typically exhibit poor structural reversibility and interfacial stability during cycling. In this study, we report the in-situ construction of a triphasic intergrowth Na/Mn/Zn-based hexacyanoferrate (mcr-Zn0.2Mn0.8) with concentration-gradient Zn distribution by an anion-controlled fractional precipitation route. Density functional theory calculations verify that the unique heterostructure arises from the different binding energies between cations and anions. A small amount of Zn2+ doping in the inner cubic/monoclinic phases enhances their structural reversibility during cycling by impeding lattice deformation induced by the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+. Meanwhile, the rhombohedral Zn-based hexacyanoferrate epitaxially grown on the surface diminishes the particle size of mcr-Zn0.2Mn0.8 resulting in short Na+ diffusion distance, and provides interface protection that suppresses detrimental electrolyte decomposition. Consequently, mcrZn(0.2)Mn(0.8) exhibits a high discharge capacity of 121.1 mAh/g at 15 mA g(-1), improved cycling stability at 750 mA g(-1) with a capacity retention of 65.0 % after 2000 cycles, and enhanced rate capability with a discharge capacity of 71.4 mAh/g at 6000 mA g(-1). The successful implementation of simultaneous surface and bulk modifications through a one-step reaction opens new possibilities for developing high-performance hexacyanoferrate cathode materials for SIBs.

TI Enhanced performance of core-shell structured sodium manganese
   hexacyanoferrate achieved by self-limiting Na<SUP>+</SUP>
   -Cs<SUP>+</SUP> ion exchange for sodium-ion batteries
SO RARE METALS
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnHCF) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and high energy density. The Jahn-Teller effect of Mn, however, leads to the poor structural stability of NaMnHCF, resulting in undesired electrochemical performance. Herein, we developed a novel coating strategy and obtained a core-shell structured NaMnHCF through facile Na+-Cs+ ion exchange, which naturally produced a robust and insoluble Cs-rich surface layer (CsMnHCF) with several nanometers in thickness on pristine NaMnHCF. It is shown that the Cs-rich surface plays a positive role in the stability of the NaMnHCF structure by prohibiting the leakage of crystal water, stabilizing the solid-liquid interfaces, and solidifying crystal structure. The electrochemical performance of the core-shell NaMnHCF is dramatically improved with a discharge capacity of 76.3 mAh.g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1.0C and a reversible capacity of 87.0 mAh.g(-1) at 10.0C, which is much superior to that of the pristine NaMnHCF with only 26.6 mAh.g(-1) after 400 cycles and 31 mAh.g(-1) at 10.0C. This work reports a new method for the synthesis of core-shell NaMnHCF and provides a novel perspective for the development of advanced NaMnHCF cathode for SIBs.

TI An anthraquinone-based covalent organic framework for highly reversible
   aqueous zinc-ion battery cathodes
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are emerging as one of the outstanding candidates for energy storage systems on account of their excellent safety, lower price, and higher volumetric energy density. Nevertheless, their advancement is troubled by the deficiency of appropriate cathode materials. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are being developed to be attractive materials for electrodes based on their stability, good crystallinity, and flexibility in structural design. Herein, an anthraquinone-based COF (TfDa-COF) and an anthracene-based COF (TpDa-COF) were synthesized and used for aqueous ZIB cathodes to investigate the essential relationship between the active functional group and electrochemical properties. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations show that introducing the anthraquinone carbonyl active site into TfDa-COF is beneficial to enhance the capacity (accounts for 95.2% of the total battery capacity) and reversibility of ZIBs compared with TpDa-COF, based on the high reversibility of the anthraquinone carbonyl active site and the structural stability of TfDa-COF, which displays a good specific capacity (96.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and exceptional stability over 10 000 cycles (98% capacity retention). This work provides instructive insight for molecular engineering to rationally design COF-based cathodes.
   TfDa-COF and TpDa-COF were used for ZIB cathodes to investigate the essential relationship between the active group and electrochemical properties. The dominance of the anthraquinone groups for coordination Zn2+ was showed by comparing the CV curves.

TI Tuning Negative Thermal Expansion in AlPO4-17 by Insertion of Guest
   Molecules
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The very strong negative thermal expansion in the porous aluminophosphate AlPO4-17 with a hexagonal erionite structure was tuned by the insertion of oxygen molecules at high pressure. The structure of the oxygen-filled material was determined in situ at high pressure by synchrotron, single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The thermal expansion of this material was measured precisely at 0.38 GPa by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. Whereas the overall volume thermal expansion only exhibits a small change with respect to empty AlPO4-17 at ambient pressure, the expansion along the a direction decreases almost to zero and the expansion along c increases by a factor of 7. Such highly anisotropic thermal expansion properties are of great interest for mechanical and optical applications as in two directions the dimensions of the material are extremely stable, whereas a very strong linear negative thermal expansion of -2.2 x 10-5 K-1 is observed in the perpendicular direction. Guest insertion is thus a very powerful tool for tuning the thermal expansion properties of porous materials.

TI Ultrastable Lactate Biosensor Linearly Responding in Whole Sweat for
   Noninvasive Monitoring of Hypoxia
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB We report on the lactate biosensor with linear calibration range from 0.5 to 100 mM, which encircles possible levels of this metabolite concentration in both human sweat and blood. The linear calibration range at high analyte concentrations, which exceeds the Michaelis constant of lactate oxidase by several orders of magnitude, is provided by an additional perfluorosulfonated ionomer diffusion membrane. In contrast to the known lactate biosensors, which retain their response within less than a couple of hours, the reported system displays 100% response for dozens of hours even upon high analyte concentrations. The biosensors with an additional diffusion-limiting membrane have been validated for lactate detection both in human blood serum and in undiluted human sweat shortly after its secretion. Both linear response in the entire range of blood and sweat lactate concentrations and ultrahigh operational stability would provide the use of the elaborated biosensor in wearable devices for the monitoring of hypoxia.

TI A manganese hexacyanoferrate framework with enlarged ion tunnels and
   two-species redox reaction for aqueous Al-ion batteries
SO NANO ENERGY
AB The recently emerging aqueous Al-ion batteries (AIBs) face the problems of poor rate capability (typically, less than 30% retention with a current density raised to 0.4 A g-1) and limited cycle life with rapid capacity degradation (typically, 50% capacity retention after 60 cycles.) The battery failure was typically attributed to the poor stability of the host structure associated with the large polar interaction between the Al ions and host. In this study, a defective manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnFe-PBA) cathode is designed with enlarged ion transportation tunnels and weakened Coulombic interactions with Al ions. Moreover, two reactive metal-sites of MnFe-PBA are both successfully activated, resulting in a large cavity for 1.2 Al ions storage per unit cell. Such structural and active site features contribute to a remarkable rate capability (50.7% capacity retention at 1.0 A g-1) and a high specific capacity of 106.3 mAh g-1. The intrinsic 3-dimensional (3D) framework of MnFe-PBA also delivered superior cycling stability: an ignorable capacity loss after 50 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 and 69.5% retention after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1. Furthermore, nanofibrillated cellulose/polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolytes were applied and successfully prolonged the cycling life to 200 cycles, and the constructed flexible quasi-state Al//MnFe-PBA batteries displayed stable output under various deformations.

TI A carbonyl-rich covalent organic framework as a high-performance cathode
   material for aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) provide high theoretical capacity, operational safety, low-cost and environmental friendliness for large-scale energy storage and wearable electronic devices, but their future development is plagued by low capacity and poor cycle life due to the lack of suitable cathode materials. In this work, a covalent organic framework (Tp-PTO-COF) with multiple carbonyl active sites is synthesized and successfully introduced in aqueous rechargeable ZIBs for the first time. Tp-PTO-COF delivers high specific capacities of 301.4 and 192.8 mA h g(-1) at current densities of 0.2 and 5 A g(-1), respectively, along with long-term durability and flat charge-discharge plateaus. The remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to the abundance of nucleophilic carbonyl active sites, well defined porous structure and inherent chemical stability of Tp-PTO-COF. Moreover, the structural evolution and Zn2+ ion intercalation mechanism are discussed and revealed by the experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations. These results highlight a new avenue to develop organic cathode materials for high performance and sustainable aqueous rechargeable ZIBs.

TI Regulating the thermostability of metal hexacyanoferrates for
   highly-efficient alkali metal ion storage
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) are regarded as low-cost high-energy cathode materials for alkali metal-ion batteries. However, the stereotype of poor thermostability of conventional HCFs has limited their research and development via high-temperature routes. In this review article, we summarize three essential factors for achieving heat-resistant HCFs: M-site metal ions, A-site alkali metal ions, and [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies. The latest applications of high-temperature water elimination and carbon coating strategies for HCFs and their promotion of alkali metal ions storage are analyzed. Finally, prospects for future HCF thermostability investigation and regulation are proposed.

TI Cobalt hexacyanoferrate based optical sensor for continuous optical
   sensing of hydrogen peroxide
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB A glass vertical bar ITO electrode electrochemically covered with cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) layer was used for creating a hydrogen peroxide-sensitive optical sensor. We have demonstrated that after electrochemical cycling in 0.5 M KCl solution, CoHCF exhibited significant optical effect during electrochromic transition between oxidized and reduced states, reversible electrochemical activity and stable chemical composition of K1.2Co1.1[Fe(CN)(6)] at oxidized state. It was determined that CoHCF layer is inert towards the oxidative impact of oxygen from the air and can be successfully regenerated into its initial oxidation state after chemical reaction with H2O2 by potential cycling. This study shows that CoHCF might be applied as a promising material in the development of optical oxidase-based biosensors where hydrogen peroxide is produced during enzymatic catalysis.

TI Electrocatalytic ammonia production from nitrite via dual-site Co 3 O 4
   /NiO catalysts derived from laser-induced cyanonickelate frameworks
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Herein, we report the pioneering synthesis of the cobalt - nickel coordination frameworks (Co(H 2 O) 2 & sdot; Ni(CN) 4 , CoNi-CF) via pulsed laser irradiation in liquids (PLIL). The distinctive morphology of CoNi-CF has attracted considerable attention as a potential template to produce Co 3 O 4 /NiO composites with varying Co and Ni ratios. After subjecting CoNi-CF to a high-temperature calcination process at 400 degrees C, the resulting Co 3 O 4 /NiO composites displayed dual-active canters for efficient electrochemical nitrite (NO 2 - ) reduction to ammonia (NH 3 ). Optimizing the Co:Ni ratio at 1:0.75 yielded Co 3 O 4 /NiO with exceptional performance, achieving a remarkable 99.4 % Faradaic efficiency in NH 3 production while maintaining a 96.1 % mass balance at -1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Furthermore, this composite displayed long-term stability, degrading 60.82 % of NO 2 - in 180 min, with high NH 3 yield rate (2012.03 mu M h -1 cm - 2 ) at -1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The superior performance in NO 2 - reduction to NH 3 can be attributed to the unique structural features inherited from CoNi-CF, including well-defined and self-standing Co 3 O 4 and NiO phases. Synergistic effects at the oxide interface enhance electrochemical performance and facilitate efficient charge transfer kinetics of Co 3 O 4 /NiO, underscoring the unique potential of these composite materials.

TI Unraveling the Fast Na Diffusion Kinetics of NASICON at High Voltage via
   High Entropy for Sodium-Ion Battery
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Vanadium based sodium superionic conductors (NASICON) have attracted unpreceded attention owing to their high structural stability and excellent Na+ ion diffusion. However, Na4VM(PO4)(3) suffer from low-rate capability and capacity decay at high voltage (approximate to 4.0 V) due to low electronic conductivity and irreversible phase transition of V4+/V5+. Herein, a high entropy Na4VFe0.6Mn0.2Cr0.1(CoMgAl)(0.1)(PO4)(3) (NVFP-HE) NASICON material is designed, which allows the intrinsic effect of multi-metal to achieve the excellent rate capability at high voltage, good ionic as well as electronic conductivity. This NVFP-HE cathode not only delivers a high discharge capacity of 141.98 mAh g(-1) at 1C, but also presents an exceptional capacity of 85.77 mAh g(-1) at as high as 50C current rate. Additionally, NVFP-HE can also retain 66.7% of initial capacity after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles at 50C. It is important to highlight that the high entropy mitigates the performance decay that arises from the irreversible phase change at 4 V. Interestingly, NVFP-HE//HC full cell delivers 81 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C. This high entropy effect and its proof of concept can allow to look for unique combinations and rationally designed advanced cathode materials for wide applications.

TI Propolis green biofilm for the immobilization of carbon nanotubes and
   metallic ions: Development of redox catalysts
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Greener materials have been used in the construction of electrochemical devices, becoming one of the main strands of this scientific development area. Thin films based on natural and renewable sources, such as propolis, allow the development of biocomposites. Hence, we have proposed the use of a thin film based on propolis for the stable and homogeneous immobilization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which increased the electrical conductivity of the base electrode (glassy carbon electrode) by almost 500 thousand times. The CNTs/propolis biofilm proportion was optimized by multivariate analysis, providing a decrease in the number of experiments, the demand for reagents, and analysis time. The biocomposite thin film was used for the spontaneous preconcentration and anchoring of metal ions, and the electrochemical synthesis of redox mediators and catalysts. This qualifies the proposed strategies for the development of eco-friendly electrochemical devices.

TI Role of the Outer Metal of Double Metal Cyanides on the Catalytic
   Efficiency in Styrene Oxidation
SO CATALYSTS
AB The catalytic efficiency of double metal cyanide (DMC) has been shown to be very effective in heterogeneous catalysis. The catalytic activity of the outer divalent cations (Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu) of a family of hexacyanocobaltates was examined in the oxidation reaction of styrene, as a model molecule, using tert Butyl Hydroperoxide (TBHP, Luperox (R)) as an oxidizing agent. The most electronegative outer cations showed the best conversions, with 95% for copper, followed by nickel with 85% conversion of the monomer at atmospheric pressure and temperature of 75 degrees C. The evidence showed that the catalytic activity and selectivity towards oxidized products are strongly linked to the accurate choice of the outer cation in the DMC together with the oxidizing agent.

TI Lowering the Water Oxidation Overpotential by Spin-Crossover in Cobalt
   Hexacyanoferrate
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is limited by the inherent linearscaling relationships of its reaction intermediates. Manipulating the spin configuration ofthe water oxidation intermediates allows us to overcome these constraints. Cobalthexacyanoferrate (CoFe-PB) is an efficient and robust water oxidation catalyst andfurther known as a magnetic switch. Its versatile electronic structure renders it a potentialcandidate for magnetic tuning of the OER. Herein, we usedfirst-principles densityfunctional theory calculations to describe the OER on two different CoFe-PB modelsystems and evaluated the possibility for spin-crossover (SCO) of their resting states. Weshow that SCO during OER can significantly lower the overpotential by 0.7 V, leading toan overpotential of around 0.3 V, which is in agreement with the experimentallymeasured value. Applying an external potential >1.5 V vs SHE, the SCO-assisted pathwaybecomes largely favored and most likely the predominant reaction pathway

TI Facile synthesis of CoFe/C nanoparticle embedded in nitrogen and sulfur
   co-doped reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites for electromagnetic wave
   absorption
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Three-dimensional metal-organic framework derivatives (MOFs) offer significant potential for the absorption of electromagnetic waves (EMW). However, the discrepancy in impedance matching restricts their ability to absorb EMW efficiently. This study synthesized a novel composite material, CoFe/C@N, S-rGO, by combining diazo coupling reactions, solvothermal techniques, and high-temperature pyrolysis. The composite consists of cobalt iron/carbon (CoFe/C) nanoparticles embedded in N and S co-doped reduced graphene oxide (N, S-rGO). The co- doping of N and S on graphene oxide (SGO) resulted in numerous defects and disordered sites, which generated interfacial and dipole polarization. The EMW absorption characteristics of the CoFe/C@N, S-rGO can be tuned by varying the quantity of SGO added. Notably, at an SGO concentration of 60 mg, the produced composite exhibits a minimal reflection loss of-53.8 dB, while a thickness of 4.0 mm yields an effective absorption bandwidth of 7.2 GHz. This material's exceptional EMW absorption capabilities are primarily attributed to interface polarization, multiple reflections, dipole polarization, natural resonance, and eddy current loss. The findings of this study provide a potential solution for enhancing the impedance matching and electromagnetic wave absorption performance of MOFs.

TI Direct Visualization of Local Spin Transition Behaviors in Thin
   Molecular Films by Bimodal AFM
SO SMALL
AB Thin films of the molecular spin-crossover complex [Fe(HB(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)(3))(2)] undergo spin transition above room temperature, which can be exploited in sensors, actuators, and information processing devices. Variable temperature viscoelastic mapping of the films by atomic force microscopy reveals a pronounced decrease of the elastic modulus when going from the low spin (5.2 +/- 0.4 GPa) to the high spin (3.6 +/- 0.2 GPa) state, which is also accompanied by increasing energy dissipation. This technique allows imaging, with high spatial resolution, of the formation of high spin puddles around film defects, which is ascribed to local strain relaxation. On the other hand, no clustering process due to cooperative phenomena was observed. This experimental approach sets the stage for the investigation of spin transition at the nanoscale, including phase nucleation and evolution as well as local strain effects.

TI Simultaneous Tailoring of Chemical Composition and Morphology
   Configuration in Metal Hexacyanoferrate for Ultrafast and Durable
   Sodium-Ion Storage
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs) with adjustable composition and open framework structures have been considered as intriguing cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Exploiting MHCFs with ultrafast and durable sodium storage capability as well as comparable capacity is always a goal that many investigators pursue, but remains challenging. Herein, simultaneous tailoring of chemical composition and morphology configuration is carried out to design a hollow monoclinic high-entropy MHCF (HMHE-HCF) assembled by nanocubes for the first time to realize the objective. The "cocktail effect" of high-entropy construction, rich sodium content of monoclinic phase, and unique hollow structure endow HMHE-HCF cathode with fast reaction kinetics and energetically stable performance during continuous charging/discharging processes. As a result, the HMHE-HCF cathode demonstrates superior rate performance up to an ultra-high rate of 100 C (71.1 % retention to 0.1 C), and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 77.8 % over 25,000 cycles at 100 C, outperforming most reported sodium-ion cathodes. Further, the HMHE-HCF//hard carbon full-cell delivers capacities of 99.0 and 82.3 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and 10 C, respectively, and retains 98.1 % of the initial capacity after 1,600 cycles at 5 C, demonstrating its potential application for sodium-ion storage.

TI Homogeneous pseudoamorphous metal phosphide clusters for ultra stable
   hydrogen generation by water electrolysis at industrial current density
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Industrial hydrogen production based on water electrolysis requires the catalysts that operate stably at ultra-high current densities for extended periods. Herein, we prepared a highly dispersed pseudoamorphous metal phosphide cluster catalyst supported by nitrogen-doped carbon layer ((NiFeCo)2P-PA/NF). Due to its excellent intrinsic activity and stable structure, (NiFeCo)2P-PA/NF can drive oxygen evolution unremittingly for more than 160 h at a current density of 500 mA cm-2 (365 mV). Theoretical calculations also show that the energy barrier of the rate-determining step in the (NiFeCo)2P-PA is effectively is reduced. This alkaline hydrogen production system using (NiFeCo)2P-PA/NF as cathode and anode can meet commercial standards, showing low cell voltage (1.590 V) and extraordinary stability (over 300 h) at industrial current densities, and driving a cell voltage of only 1.372 V for 100 mA cm-2 in the urea alkaline hydrogen production system, demonstrating its potential for industrial applications.

TI Surface-defect engineering of a nickel hexacyanoferrate material for
   high-performance printed flexible supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) are considered to be a promising electrochemical energy source for wearable electronic products. However, the absence of high-performance electrode materials and effective manufacturing techniques of devices hinder the volume production of FSCs. Here, a facile surface-etching method is investigated to prepare high-performance nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) electrode materials, and further, a screen-printing strategy is employed to realize high-volume production of FSCs. Compared with conventional NiHCF electrodes, the Na2Ni[Fe(CN)(6)]-based electrode with surface defect offers a specific capacity of 184 C g(-1) (100 C g(-1) for conventional NiHCF), and its capacity retention is 91% after 10 000 cycles. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the excellent cycling stability can be attributed to the negligible structural distortion during the Na+ insertion/extraction process (similar to 6% volume change). Subsequently, symmetric FSCs are constructed by printing the NiHCF electrode materials on flexible PET substrates, displaying excellent areal capacitance of 7.3 mF cm(-2) (0.1 mA cm(-2)) and energy density and power density of 0.65 mu W h cm(-2) and 0.4 mW cm(-2), respectively. The surface-defect engineering provides a low-cost strategy to construct nickel hexacyanoferrate materials with outstanding electrochemical properties. The printed electronic techniques we have demonstrated for large-scale and low-cost printing FSCs applications are inspiring.

TI Phosphotungstic acid assisted growth of nickel hexacyanoferrate on Ni
   foam for binder-free supercapacitor electrode
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The in-situ growth of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanocubes on Ni foam (Ni-HCF/Ni foam) was achieved with a one-step hydrothermal method with Ni foam as both the current collector and the nickel source. Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) acting as the oxidizing agent, oxidized elemental nickel to Ni2+ cations, which subsequently reacted with K3Fe(CN)6 to produce Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2 nanocubes. The prepared binder-free NiHCF/Ni foam was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The electrochemical performances of Ni-HCF/Ni foam were further investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostastic charge/discharge technique (GCD). Ni-HCF/Ni foam exhibits areal capacitance of 7200 mF cm-2 (specific capacitance of 535.3F g-1) at 10 mA cm-2, high energy density and long cycling life. An asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled with Ni-HCF/Ni foam and activated carbon (AC) as the positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. The ASC exhibits remarkable energy density of 5.89 W h m-2 at a high power density of 75 W m-2.

TI Paving pathway for reliable cathodes development in aqueous aluminum-ion
   batteries: a mini review
SO RARE METALS
AB The cost and limited availability of lithium resources have encouraged researchers to explore next-generation batteries. Among the emerging batteries systems, aqueous aluminum-ion batteries (AAIBs) stand as appealing electrochemical storage systems due to the high theoretical volume density, abundant resources and inherent safety of aluminum. Although substantial endeavors have been dedicated to AAIBs development, the narrow electrochemical window of aqueous electrolyte, hydrogen evolution reaction of aluminum electrode, low energy density and inferior cycle stability still hinder the development of AAIBs. Among these, the development of high-energy density and stable cathode materials is particularly significant. However, there exists considerable challenge remaining in devising cathode materials, which is mainly ascribed to the pronounced electrostatic repulsion from the inherently high charge density of Al3+. Therefore, this review comprehensively reviews recent advancements in the AAIBs cathodes, with a special focus on energy storage mechanism of different kinds of cathodes. Ultimately, it elucidates the primary challenges toward achieving high-performance AAIBs and outlines future research prospects.

TI Controllable design of a macroporous PBA as an efficient non-enzymatic
   electrochemical sensor for glucose detection
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB A novel highly sensitive and selective non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor of glucose has been achieved based on a macroporous bird's nest-like CoFePBA nanomaterial, namely HN-CoFePBA. Its pore size is about 750 nm. It is the first time that a hollow PBA material with such a big hole has been successfully obtained based on a two-step design strategy. Herein, ZIF-67 is selected as a sacrificial template and in situ converted and fabricated into the target PBA. More remarkably, the as-synthesized HN-CoFePBA as an electrochemical sensor realizes high-performance detection of glucose including a wide linear range of 5 & mu;M-0.57 mM, a high sensitivity of 564.6 & mu;A mM-1 cm-2, a low limit of detection (LOD), remarkable stability and good selectivity. The related sensing mechanism for the enhanced glucose performance is also discussed in detail. In a word, this work has developed a new avenue for the construction of macroporous PBA materials with excellent sensing performance.

TI Influence of Vacancies in Manganese Hexacyanoferrate Cathode for Organic
   Na-Ion Batteries: A Structural Perspective
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrates (MnHCF) are promising positive electrode materials for non-aqueous batteries, including Na-ion batteries, due to their large specific capacity (> 130 mAhg(-1)), high discharge potential and sustainability. Typically, the electrochemical reaction of MnHCF associates with phase and structural changes, due to the Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of Mn sites upon the charge process. To understand the effect of the MnHCF structure on its electrochemical performance, two MnHCF materials with different vacancies content are investigated herein. The electrochemical results show that the sample with lower vacancy content (4%) exhibits relatively higher capacity retention of 99.1% and 92.6% at 2nd and 10th cycles, respectively, with respect to 97.4% and 79.3% in sample with higher vacancy content (11 %). Ex-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization results show that a weaker cooperative JT-distortion effect and relatively smaller crystal structure modification occurred for the material with lower vacancies, which explains the better electrochemical performance in cycled electrodes.

TI Ion exchange to construct a high-performance core-shell MnFe-PB@CuFe-PB
   cathode material for sodium ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnFe-PB) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries because of its advantages of high operating voltage and high theoretical capacity. However, the structural phase transition of MnFe-PB during the working process will cause the Jahn-Teller effect, which destroys the stability of the interface and the structure of the material. Considering these factors, it is necessary to build a stable interface on the surface of MnFe-PB to keep the structure stable by using low-cost materials in a simple way for commercial applications. In this work, an ion exchange method is used to form a uniform coating layer of sodium copper hexacyanoferrate (CuFe-PB) on the surface of MnFe-PB. The existence of the coating layer effectively prevents Mn from dissolving into the electrolyte, inhibits the Jahn-Teller effect, and alleviates structural collapse. In 200 cycles at 0.1C, MnFe-PB@CuFe-PB maintains a capacity of 119.3 mA h g(-1), 87.3% more than that of MnFe-PB. This simple and cheap ion exchange method for constructing a stable coating on MnFe-PB can well meet the actual demand of large-scale industrial production.

TI Design three-dimensional CoFe2O4 nanocage via ion exchange route for
   ultra-sensitive electrochemical sensing of nitrobenzene
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Bimetallic transition metal oxide materials have rich valence states, good biocompatibility, conductivity, high stability, and satisfactory catalytic performance, and stand out among many materials. Therefore, we develop a simple synthesis method of CoFe2O4 nanocage by ion exchange for the detection of nitrobenzene (NB) in this work, which uses the zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as cobalt source and three-dimensional hollow organic framework Co-Fe PBA as precursor. The continuous conversion between ionic valence states in CoFe2O4 enhances the conductivity of the material, showing a good synergistic coupling effect. The low-density hollow structure of nanocage offers various types of sites for adsorbing reactants, and the thin shell structures provide more channels for ion migration and electron transport, facilitate charge transfer, and further improve their electrical sensing ability. Electrochemical tests proved that the material demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity for NB, with the limit of detection as low as 0.038 mu M, a wide linear response (0.05-1664.55 mu M), higher sensitivity, good repeatability, long-term stability and selectivity. More importantly, the sensor has been suc-cessfully applied to the determination of trace NB in water samples with satisfactory recovery (98.7%-104.7%). This work provides a novel idea for the detection of low content of NB and expands the application of bimetallic oxide materials in the sensing field.

TI A new strategy to exploit maximum rate performance for aqueous batteries
   through a judicious selection of MOF-type electrodes
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB A metal-organic framework (MOF) having a redox active 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (NDI) derivative in its organic linker shows excellent rate performance as an electrode material for aqueous batteries thanks to its large pores. Among aqueous electrolytes examined, K+-based ones exhibit the highest rate performance, which is caused by the highest mobility of the smallest hydrated K+ ion not only in the aqueous electrolyte but also in the electrode. Since the use of a counter electrode with insufficiently small pores for the full-cell configuration offsets this merit, our study may lead to a conclusion that the maximum rate performance for aqueous batteries will be accomplished only through further elaboration of both electrode materials with sufficiently large pores, in which hydrated ions can travel equally fast as those in the electrolyte.

TI EDTA derived graphene supported porous cobalt hexacyanoferrate
   nanospheres as a highly electroactive nanocomposite for hydrogen
   peroxide sensing
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The importance of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) determination has been rapidly increasing due to its significant usage in biological and industrial applications. Hence, highly sensitive and selective sensors are required for H2O2 determination. This work demonstrates the development of highly sensitive electrochemical H2O2 sensors by using a spray exfoliated graphene and porous cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanosphere (Gr/P-CoHCF-NSPs) composite. The liquid phase high-pressure spray exfoliation technique was used to exfoliate high-quality graphene for electrochemical sensing applications. The EDTA chelation strategy was used for the homogeneous formation of P-CoHCF-NSPs on spray exfoliated graphene surfaces. The large electroactive surface area and excellent electron transfer ability of spray exfoliated graphene significantly enhanced the H2O2 sensing ability of the composite. The synthesized Gr/P-CoHCF-NSPs composite is highly reactive towards the oxidation of H2O2. The sensitivity of the fabricated sensor was 914 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) in a linearity range of 1 to 1000 mu M. The LOD of the fabricated sensors was around 1 mu M. Comparing the fabricated sensors with recently developed H2O2 sensors indicates a significant improvement in sensitivity and LOD. The interference study of the fabricated sensors revealed their highly selective nature towards H2O2 sensing. The recovery and real sample analysis of the fabricated sensors confirmed that the Gr/P-CoHCF-NSPs based H2O2 sensors are potential candidates for H2O2 detection in real samples.

TI A sustainable and low-cost route to design FeNi alloy/carbon-decorated
   coal fly ash with enhanced microwave absorption
SO SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB The recycle of coal fly ash (CFA) is of momentous value to relieve the growing levels of the serious environment pollution. Herein, light-weight and low-cost microwave absorption (MA) materials CFA based composites assisted by carbon and FeNi alloy (FeNi/C-CFA) were constructed by an impregnation-carbonization process. The actions of the loading of carbon network and Fe/Ni species distributed in the CFA matrix, and the MA perfor-mances of FeNi/C-CFA composites were assessed in detail. The results showed that the FeNi/C-CFA with wrapping structure exhibited the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of-39.2 dB with the coating thickness of 3.5 mm, while the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) was measured to be 4.8 GHz (10.6-15.4 GHz) at a coating thickness of 2.0 mm. Their favorable MA performances were mainly from combined actions of the unique morphologies, good impedance matching and improving attenuation characteristics. Thus, these MA materials recycling from solid waste CFA may be a potential candidate for eliminating electromagnetic pollution along with the source abundance, low-cost, lightweight and easy preparation.

TI How Does Ion Exchange Construct Binary Hexacyanoferrate? A Case Study
SO ACS OMEGA
AB In this work, using electrochemical active Fe as an ion-exchange element (attack side) and the NaxMnFe(CN)(6) slurry with a high solid content (MnHCF) as a template (defensive side), a series of binary hexacyanoferrates are prepared via a simple Mn/Fe ion-exchange process, in which NaxFeFe(CN)(6) (FeHCF) and solid solution Na-x(FeMn)Fe(CN)(6) are concentrated on the shell and the core, respectively. The proportions of the two structures are mainly controlled by the competition between the ion-exchange rate in the bulk material and dissolution-reprecipitation rate. Slowing down the attacking rate, such as the use of a chelating agent complexed with the attacker Fe, is advantageous to form a thermodynamically metastable state with homogeneous distribution of elements since the diffusion of Fe2+ in the solid MnHCF is relatively fast. The shell FeHCF could be adjusted by the dissolution-reprecipitation rate, which is driven by the solubility difference. Adding the chelating agent in the defensive side will promote the dissolution of MnHCF and reprecipitation of FeHCF on the surface. Meanwhile, with the increase of Fe sources, the thickness of the shell FeHCF increases, and correspondingly the content of solid solution decreased due to FeHCF is more stable than solid solutions in thermodynamics. Finally, such a design principle in this case study could also be generalized to other ion-exchange processes. Considering the difference of two components in solubility, the larger difference can make the core/shell structure more clear due to the enhancement of dissolution-reprecipitation route.

TI Theoretical prediction of negative thermal expansion in cubic
   VF3
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Designing and discovering negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials is important in precisely controlled thermal expansion devices. In this work, the NTE of a cubic metal fluoride, ReO3-type VF3, was predicted by density functional theory within the quasi-harmonic approximation. These results reveal that cubic VF3 displays a negative thermal expansion behavior below 200 K, and the predicted minimum negative thermal expansion coefficient is approximately -6.4 x 10(-6) K-1 at 80 K. The negative thermal expansion was mainly dominated by the prominently negative Gr & uuml;neisen parameter situated at M(0.5,0.5,0) and R(0.5,0.5,0.5). The underlying mechanism was attributed to the anisotropic F atom vibration, where the amplitude of transverse vibration perpendicular to the V-F-V connection was much larger than that of the vibration along the parallel V-F-V direction. This research provides a good understanding of the relationship between NTE and crystal structure.

TI Vanadium oxide nanospheres encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanofibers
   with morphology and defect dual-engineering toward advanced aqueous
   zinc-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Vanadium-based electrodes are regarded as attractive cathode materials in aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) caused by their high capacity and unique layered structure. However, it is extremely challenging to acquire high electrochemical performance owing to the limited electronic conductivity, sluggish ion kinetics, and severe volume expansion during the insertion/extraction process of Zn2+. Herein, a series of V2O3 nanospheres embedded N-doped carbon nanofiber structures with various V2O3 spherical morphologies (solid, core-shell, hollow) have been designed for the first time by an electrospinning technique followed thermal treatments. The N-doped carbon nanofibers not only improve the electrical conductivity and the structural stability, but also provides encapsulating shells to prevent the vanadium dissolution and aggregation of V2O3 particles. Furthermore, the varied morphological structures of V2O3 with abundant oxygen vacancies can alleviate the volume change and increase the Zn2+ pathway. Besides, the phase transition between V2O3 and ZnXV2O5_m center dot nH(2)O in the cycling was also certified. As a result, the as-obtained composite delivers excellent long-term cycle stability and enhanced rate performance for coin cells, which is also confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Even assembled into flexible ZIBs, the sample still exhibits superior electrochemical performance, which may afford new design concept for flexible cathode materials of ZIBs.

TI Unraveling the high Energy efficiency for Zn||metal hexacyanoferrate
   batteries in a zinc-potassium hybrid configuration
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Aqueous zinc batteries suffer from high overpotentials due to the sluggish diffusion of Zn2+ in the host and low potential of the cathode partially owing to the high desolvation energy for the hydrated Zn2+ cations, which lead to the unsatisfactory Energy efficiency although high Coulombic efficiency can be achieved in most cases. Here we achieved a high Energy efficiency up to 89% for the energy storage of Zn2+ ions through selecting cathode with stable frameworks and suitable tunnels. Furthermore, through screening different metal ions, K+ ion stands out due to its weak hydration structure and smallest charge/radius ratio. The overpotential for both Zn2+ and K+ ions were researched, and the dominated factor is the small diffusion barrier of charge carriers in the selected cathode structure. Based on the pre-built cathode and screened charge carrier of K+, a high discharge voltage plateau around 1.9 V was obtained, with a small overpotential (< 0.12 V), thus an extraordinary Energy effi-ciency around 93% that is almost irrelevant to the current density was obtained. We wish our research can arouse attention of community on Energy efficiency of aqueous electrolyte batteries.

TI Novel synthesis of CuHCF/B-rGO composites for oxygen evolution reaction
   activity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this work, we have focused on the preparation of copper hexacyanoferrate/boron doped rGO composites (abbreviated as CuHCF/B-rGO) by employing simple co-precipitation technique subsequently processed with ultrasonication method. The XRD spectra confirmed the existence of the cubic structure of copper hexacyanoferrate with high crystalline peaks. The prepared nanocomposite morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and confirmed CuHCF nanoparticles formation with flake-like and wrinkled sheets. Pure CuHCF nanostructures revealed good OER action at 430 mV to obtain 10 mA/cm2. The obtained CuHCF product OER activity can be further upgraded by incorporating the electrically conductive boron doped reduced graphene oxide matrix into CuHCF nanostructures, for the reason that the overpotential of the CuHCF/B-rGO was reduced to 380 mV to attain 10 mA/cm2 with 88 mV/dec Tafel slope value. The doping of heteroatom considerably improves charge-transfer resistance of metal hexacyanoferrate, giving a small resistance value of 2.97 ohm, which was lower than that of CuHCF (5.57 ohm) and CuHCF/rGO (4.31 ohm). Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the CuHCF/B-rGO was stable at prolonged hours with a small decay of 12.5%. Therefore, this work offers new approach to stimulate the catalytic performance of metal hexcyanoferrate by highly conductive carbon-based materials for water splitting performance.

TI Lean-water electrolyte to stabilize zinc anode and suppress manganese
   dissolution of cathode for ampere-hour zinc batteries
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Rechargeable Zinc battery technologies are regarded as viable candidates for large-scale energy storage due to constitutional safety and inexpensive position. Nevertheless, the strong polarity of H2O molecules initiates the deterioration of both zinc metal anode and cathode. At anode side, radical H2O molecules cause side reactions of zinc corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth. At cathode side, the dissolution of transition metal brings about severe capacity fading of cathodes. Herein, we replace the 90% H2O sheath of Zn2+ solvation with 1,3-propanediol (PDO) molecules to form a lean-water electrolyte, in which the abundant PDO molecules can significantly suppress 99.9% HER and prohibit the Zn dendrite growth, while H2O molecules with a molecular lubrication mechanism enables fast ion transportation. Consequently, at anode side, Zn plating/ stripping reversibly processes over 4000 cycles with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.24% in Zn||Cu cell. At cathode side, the decreased water activity and scarce solute-water dissolving surfaces suppress 98.6% dissolution of manganese species. The Zn||MnHCF full cell demonstrates high capacity of 140.7 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.1 A center dot g(-1) and ultra-long lifespan of 3000 cycles with 85.4% initial capacity retained. More importantly, a 1.4 Ah ZnllMnHCF pouch cell shows excellent lifespan over 150 cycles with charge/discharge run time > 68 days. We expect that this work will promote the practicability of aqueous Zn-ion batteries for grid-scale energy storage.

TI Dual carbon decorated Na3MnTi(PO4)3: A
   high-energy-density cathode material for sodium-ion batteries
SO NANO ENERGY
AB NASICON-structured Na3MnTi(PO4)(3) (NMTP) is a high-energy sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathode material. However, the low rate capability and unsatisfactory cycle life limit its practical applications. Herein, a dual carbon decoration strategy has been proposed to tackle the above-mentioned issues of NMTP. The semi-graphitic carbon and reduced graphene oxide co-functionalized NMTP (NMTP/C@rGO) demonstrates a specific capacity of similar to 114 mAh g(-1), reaching a high energy density of similar to 410 Wh kg(-1) with an average discharge potential of similar to 3.6 V. Besides, the NMTP/C@rGO also manifests long-term durability and high rate capability. More importantly, the NMTP/C@rGO also demonstrates ideal electrochemical properties in NMTP/C@rGO//soft carbon full cells. The impressive electrochemical performances make the NMTP/C@rGO a reliable cathode material for SIBs.

TI In situ irradiated XPS proved efficient charge transfer on graphdiyne
   (CnH2n-2) based tandem NiFe PBA/CuI/GD S-scheme heterostructure for
   photocatalytic hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Due to its abundant carbon chemical bonds, large conjugated system and natural pore structure, graphdiyne (GD, CnH2n-2) shows great advantages in growth, assembly and performance regulation, and is a key material to promote innovative development in catalysis, energy and other fields. In this study, NiFe PBA cube was prepared by coprecipitate method, and then NiFe PBA/CuI/GD ternary composite photocatalyst was formed by tightly coating NiFe PBA and CuI with graphitylene material. In situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizes the change in electron cloud density of a catalyst under illumination, so as to determine the series-type transfer path of photogenerated electrons between three single photocatalysts, thus revealing the formation of double S-scheme heterojunction. Photocurrent and fluorescence tests have confirmed that the photogenerated carriers in NiFe PBA/CuI/GD can be transferred rapidly and utilized efficiently to participate in the photo-catalytic reaction under the action of strong interfacial electric field. In addition, the three-dimensional structure of NiFe PBA and CuI and the surface carbon layer synergistic effect to expand the utilization rate of visible light catalyst. This work provides a new idea for the construction of S-scheme heterojunction and the application of new carbon materials in the field of photocatalysis.

TI Contribution of different metal nodes on stepwise electrocatalysis in
   lithium-sulfur batteries
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB The mechanism of multifunctional sulfur-fixing materials on molecular / atomic level is important for selecting and designing effective electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Therefore, metal coordination com-pounds (M = Co / Fe / CoFe) with unique catalytic behavior are selected as cathode additives to promote the sluggish reaction kinetics caused by multiphase conversion and focus on adsorption-catalysis mechanism. It is found that Co sites are conducive to promoting the generation of lithium sulfide that increase the specific discharge capacity, while Fe sites are beneficial for the adsorption of polysulfides that increase the capacity retention. The combination of Co and Fe sites can inhibit the polysulfides diffusion and induce the rapid and uniform deposition of lithium sulfide. Benefiting from the dual-anchoring of efficient Metal-S and Li-N bonds and special catalysis of Co sites, the CoFe PBA@S cells exhibit remarkable cyclability and capability. The cell delivers a small capacity fading rate (0.052% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1), excellent rate capability (811.86 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1) and ultrahigh capability retention (1143.7 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g-1). Even with a high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm-2, it still shows reversible capacity of 789.7 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g-1. This work provides a rational direction to select and design effective electrocatalysts for LSBs.

AB The rapid progress in wearable electronics highlights the crucial need for advanced flexible energy storage solutions. This study presents a synergistic combination of laser-assisted polymer carbonization and ion deposition techniques to fabricate flexible electrode materials with outstanding electrochemical activity for energy storage applications. Flexible graphene-based electrodes fabricated through laser-assisted synthesis were modified with CoMnHCF nanocrystals using aqueous solutions of appropriate salts by a simple and environmentally friendly SILAR (Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction) method. The CoMnHCF/laser-induced metal-polymer composite (LIMPc) electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in an aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte, achieving a high specific capacitance of 224.5 mF cm-2 (at 0.5 mF cm-2). Furthermore, CoMnHCF/LIMPc showed remarkable rate capability and maintained long-term cycling stability after 10 000 cycles. A flexible asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled based on CoMnHCF/LIMPc as the cathode and LIMP & scy; as the anode. This technique's versatility holds potential for fabricating other electrode materials with tailored compositions for diverse applications across multiple scientific and technological domains.

TI Rubik's cube PBA frameworks for optimizing the electrochemical
   performance in alkali metal-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB PBA frameworks have stood out among metal-organic frameworks because of their easy preparation, excellent stability, porous structures, and rich redox properties. Unfortunately, their non-ideal conductivity and significant volume expansion during cycling prevent more widespread application in alkali-metal-ion (Li+, Na+, and K+) batteries. By changing the type and molar ratio of metal ions, Rubik's PBA frameworks with infinite structural variations were obtained in this study, just like the Rubik's cube undergoes infinite changes during the rotation. X-ray adsorption fine structure measurements have documented the existence and determined the coordination environment of the metal ions in the Rubik's PBA framework. Benefiting from the more stable Rubik's cube structures with diverse composition, enhanced conductivity, and greater adsorption capacity, the obtained Rubik's cubes CoM-PBA anodes, especially CoZn-PBA deliver the enhanced cycling and rate performance in all the alkali-metal-ion batteries. The findings are supported by density functional theory calculations. Ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in-situ X-ray diffraction measurements were undertaken to explore the storage mechanism of CoZn-PBA anodes. Our results further demonstrate that the Rubik's cube PBA framework-based materials could be widely applied in the field of alkali-metal-ion batteries.

TI Toward Safe and Reliable Aqueous Ammonium Ion Energy Storage Systems
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Aqueous batteries using non-metallic charge carriers like proton (H+) and ammonium (NH4+) ions are becoming more popular compared to traditional metal-ion batteries, owing to their enhanced safety, high performance, and sustainability (they are ecofriendly and derived from abundant resources). Ammonium ion energy storage systems (AIBs), which use NH4+ ions with tetrahedral geometry, a small hydrated ionic radius, and relatively low ionic weight, are emerging as strong candidates in non-metal ion battery chemistry. Various electrode materials (both inorganic and organic) are investigated as hosts for NH4+ ions, however, a comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is still lacking. This gap limits the ability to optimize performance and identify further research opportunities in AIBs. In this review, the charge storage mechanisms in AIBs are discussed, offering insights into the interactions between NH4+ ions and different electrode materials. Additionally, existing literature on electrode materials, highlighting key structural, and electrochemical achievements are summarized. The review also outlines various electrolytes and examines how their properties influence AIB performance. Finally, the shortcomings of current research are discussed and potential solutions are suggested to advance AIB technology, with the goal of inspiring researchers to explore real-world applications for ammonium ion batteries.
   The article focuses on the ammonium ion energy storage with a discussion on the charge storage mechanism of the ammonium ion in different host materials. Further, the performance of the electrode materials and the electrolytes that are used in the application of ammonium ion energy storage is elucidated. image

First-order transitions and tricritical points are present for the coordination number q = 4 whereas at q = 3 they are absent. Global compensation phenomena are absent for the magnetic system. Instead, it is shown that it can only occur between the sublattice magnetizations B and C of the system. Several novel kinds of reentrance of the phase boundaries while varying the values of model parameters have been reported.

TI In-situ introduction of CePO4 for stabilizing
   electrocatalytic activity of quasi-MOF with partially missing C≡N
   skeleton
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Hydrogen (H-2) is considered one of the most promising green energy sources due to its high combustion heat value and non-polluting byproducts after combusting. Electrolysis of water to product H-2 is a safe and stable way. Nevertheless, the current commercially available electrocatalysts suffer from high cost and slow reaction kinetics, hindering the widespread application of electrocatalytic water splitting. Metal-organic framework (MOF) have been concerned widespread as materials with high activity sites in the field of electrocatalyst. However, the presence of organic frameworks in MOF results in slow electron transfer rates and weak catalytic activity. To address this issue, this research has constructed a novel CePO4/quasi-MOF heterostructure with partial amorphous phase. The partial absence of organic frameworks in this heterostructure exposes more active metal sites, while the presence of the amorphous phase enhances the porosity of material. The overpotentials (eta(10)) of CePO4/ Ce-PBA-2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are 242 and 192 mV, respectively. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that constructing the CePO4/Ce-PBA-2 heterostructure with missing C equivalent to N frameworks partially accelerates the electron transfer between metal ions, improving the reaction kinetics of HER and OER effectively. On the other hand, CePO4/Ce-PBA-2 exhibited a specific capacitance of 1346.7F g(-1) at 1 A/g. The CePO4/quasi-MOF heterostructure achieves efficient electrocatalytic water splitting and energy storage in supercapacitors simultaneously. This study further paves the way for the application and development of MOF in the field of electrochemistry.

TI Challenges and Strategies toward Manganese Hexacyanoferrate for
   High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as a beneficial complement to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems because of the abundant sodium resources. However, the relatively large ionic radius of Na+ inevitably results in a huge volume change and sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics, which put forward higher requirements for electrode materials. Among the reported cathode materials for SIBs, the manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) with the merits of large channels for fast sodium ion transport, high theoretical capacity and low cost has attracted extensive attention. In this review, the recent achievements of MnHCF for SIBs are focused. The key challenges of MnHCF limiting the practical application include the interstitial water, vacancies, low electronic conductivity, and the Jahn-Teller effect. Subsequently, the mainstream strategies to boost the sodium storage performance of MnHCF are summarized (such as structure regulation, surface coating, hybridization with carbon materials, and element substitution). Finally, the potential research directions are also proposed to promote the practical application of MnHCF for SIBs. This review is expected to provide a whole insight into exploring MnHCF cathode materials for SIBs.

TI Cyano-Bridged Cu-Ni Coordination Polymer Nanoflakes and Their Thermal
   Conversion to Mixed Cu-Ni Oxides
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Herein, we demonstrate the bottom-up synthesis of 2D cyano-bridged Cu-Ni coordination polymer (CP) nanoflakes through a controlled crystallization process and their conversion to Cu-Ni mixed oxides via a thermal treatment in air. The chelating effect of citrate anions effectively prevents the rapid coordination reaction between Cu2+ and K-2[Ni(CN)(4)], resulting in the deceleration of the crystallization process of CPs. Specifically, with addition of trisodium citrate dehydrate, the number of nuclei formed at the early stage of the reaction is decreased. Less nuclei undergo a crystal growth by interacting with [Ni(CN)(4)](2-), leading to the formation of larger Cu-Ni CP nanoflakes. Following heat treatment in air, the -CN- groups present within the CP nanoflakes are removed and nanoporous Cu-Ni mixed oxide nanoflakes are generated. When tested as an electrode material for supercapacitors using a three-electrode system, the optimum Cu-Ni mixed oxide sample shows a maximum specific capacitance of 158 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). It is expected that the proposed method will be useful for the preparation of other types of 2D and 3D CPs as precursors for the creation of various nanoporous metal oxides.

TI Morphological Anisotropy in Metal-Organic Framework Micro/Nanostructures
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Anisotropy plays a unique role in the structural regulation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites, especially at the micro- and nanoscale. However, there is a lack of a understanding of MOF micro/nanoparticles (MNPs) from the perspective of morphological anisotropy. In this Minireview, recent advances in anisotropic MOF MNPs are summarized, with a focus on how morphological anisotropy leads to innovative structures and modulates properties. First, anisotropic pristine MOF MNPs with diverse morphologies are introduced and classified by their morphology-dependent and morphology-independent anisotropy. Secondly, the anisotropy-enabled site-selective higher-order construction of MOF-based materials is highlighted. Finally, challenges and prospects for anisotropic MOFs are discussed, aiming to provide inspiration for further developments in this interesting research field.

TI Morphology and Conductivity of Copper Hexacyanoferrate Films
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Films of conductive coordination network com-pounds are interesting as functional materials for charge storage, electrocatalysis, electrochromic switching, or conversion of light. The electrical conductivity depends on not only intrinsic material properties but also grain boundaries. Copper hexacyanoferrate shows a remarkable variation in film morphologies depending on the preparation route. Conductive films can only be obtained for continuous crystalline films that have been received by a combination of sonication-assisted casting and vapor-assisted conversion. Electrical conductivities of these films are higher than those of powder pellets with a similar crystal structure. Temperature-dependent and humidity-dependent measurements on powder pellets revealed the activation energies for charge transport. Thermogravimetric analysis, temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction data, and humidity-dependent measurements on powder pellets revealed the activation energies for charge transport and the role of proton conductivity.

TI Negative Thermal Expansion of GaFe(CN)6 and Effect of Na
   Insertion by First-Principles Calculations
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We study the negative thermal expansion (NTE) properties and effect of Na insertion on the NTE of the framework material GaFe(CN)(6) by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory within the quasi-harmonic approximation. The calculated results show that the material exhibits NTE due to the low transverse vibrational modes of the CN groups. The modes demonstrate larger negative values of the mode Gruneisen parameters. Once Na is introduced in the framework of the material, it prefers to locate at the center of the quadrates of the framework material and binds to the four N anions nearby. As a consequence, the transverse vibrational mode of the CN group is clearly hindered and the NTE of the material is weakened. Our theoretical calculations have clarified the mechanisms of NTE and the effect of the guest Na on the NTE of the framework material.

TI One-step hydrothermal growth of reduced graphene oxide/nickel
   hexacyanoferrate nanocomposite on Ni foam for binder-free supercapacitor
   electrode
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB The in-situ growth of nickel hexacyanoferrate/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (Ni-HCF/rGO) on Ni foam was successfully achieved with a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Ni foam was not only used as the current collector but also the nickel source. By simply heating Ni foam in the aqueous solution containing graphene oxide (GO), potassium ferricyanide and P-toluenesulfonic acid (TSA), Ni-HCF/rGO nanocube arrays were synthesized on Ni foam. X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron miscroscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the Ni-HCF/rGO. As the supercapacitor electrode, Ni-HCF/rGO/Ni foam exhibits high capacity, long cycling life and good rate capability in 2.0 M KOH aqueous solution. An asymmetrical supercapacitor device (ASC) was assembled with Ni-HCF/rGO/Ni foam and activated carbon (AC) as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The fabricated ASC presents a maximum energy density of 4.38 W h m(-2) at power density of 34 W m(-2), suggesting its potential in practical applications.

TI Petroleum coke derived porous carbon/NiCoP with efficient reviving
   catalytic and adsorptive activity as sulfur host for high performance
   lithium-sulfur batteries
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Sulfur-host material with abundant pore structure and high catalysis plays an important role in development of high-energy-density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we implanted NiCoP nanoparticles into the N,S co-doped porous carbon derived from petroleum coke (PCPC) to fabricate the sulfur-host of PCPC/NiCoP composites. The high specific surface area of PCPC provides abundant adsorption sites for capturing LiPSs and the NiCoP nanoparticles to improve the polarity and boost the LiPSs conversion kinetics of PCPC. The Li-S cells fabricated with PCPC/NiCoP as sulfur-host deliver high discharge capacity of 1,462.7 mAh.g(-1) lunder the current density of 0.1 C and exhibit ultralong lifespan over 800 cycles under the current density of 1, 2, and even 5 C. Additionally, the prepared composites cathodes deliver an outstanding discharge capacity of 932.5 and 826.4 mAh.g(-1) at 0.5 and 1 C with a high sulfur loading of over 3.90 mg.cm(-2), and remain stable about 60 cycles. Furthermore, the promoted adsorption-conversion process of polysulfides by introducing NiCoP nanoparticles into PCPC was investigated by experimental and theoretical calculation studies. This work offers a new light for tacking the obstacles of porous carbon-based sulfur-host and propelling the development of petroleum coke-based porous carbon for high performance Li-S batteries.

TI Boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2 by
   using copper hexacyanocobaltate as co-catalyst
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The development of cheap and efficient co-catalysts is crucial to improve the performance of well-known photocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, copper hexacyanocobaltate was evaluated for the first time as a potential candidate to be used as co-catalyst coupled with conventional TiO2. Copper hexacyanocobaltate was formed by chemical precipitation in the presence of TiO2, without needing further treatments. The composite exhibited paramount performance towards hydrogen generation, surpassing by up to 16 times the behavior reached with bare TiO2. This composite also overcome the performance of conventional TiO2 modified with copper and cobalt oxides derived from copper hexacyanocobaltate. The enhanced behavior of TiO2/Cu3[Co(CN)(6)](2) composite was promoted by the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carries, and the faster charge transfer from photocatalyst towards species in solution, as it was proved by the photoelectrochemical characterization of the materials. Furthermore, the composite experienced a slight detriment (15%) in its hydrogen production rate after four consecutive photocatalyst tests. This variation was attributed to the slow leaching of copper in the co catalyst caused by its partial transformation into metal hydroxides, as it was suggested by the ex-situ XPS characterization. Nevertheless, the structural characterization evinced the presence of the Cu-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) in the composite after long-term use. This study should be considered a proof of concept on a reliable route to obtain appropriate composites for hydrogen production using light as primary energy source.

TI Citrate-mediated synthesis of highly crystalline transition metal
   hexacyanoferrates and their Na ion storage properties
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB In this work, highly crystalline transition-metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs) have been synthesized in the presence of citrate, which is found not only to mediate the precipitation reaction rate but also prevent the MHCF crystals from aggregation. This method is applicable to a wide range of MHCFs with different transition metals (e.g., Co, Ni, Mn and Zn). The highly crystalline MHCFs with little Fe(CN)(6) vacancies and rich alkaline ions exhibited significantly improved electrochemical performance for Na ion storage in both aqueous and organic electrolytes. The effect of transition metals in MHCFs on the Na ion storage performance has been investigated in an aqueous electrolyte. Results showed that the CoHCF nanocube sample displayed the highest electrochemical performance than other MHCFs samples synthesized in this work. This CoHCF sample exhibits a specific capacity of 85 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). The CoHCF sample also displays a good cycling stability with capacity retentions of 92% after 12,000 cycles in aqueous electrolyte (0.5 M Na2SO4) and 78% after 10,000 cycles in organic electrolyte (NaClO4 in PC + EC with 5% FEC).

TI A high-efficiency oxygen evolution electrocatalyst based on a
   Co3[Co(CN)6]2@NiFe LDH composite
   material
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Due to the slow kinetics and large overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical water splitting, it is important to develop efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for the OER. In this work, we used Co-PBA as the substrate, and induced the growth of NiFe-LDH on the surface of cubic Co-PBA by the hydrothermal method. The Co-PBA@NiFe-LDH electrocatalysts with a flower-like morphology and heterostructures were finally utilized to evaluate the OER performance. The results reveal that during the OER process, the flower-like structure allows Co-PBA@NiFe-LDH-30 to expose more active centers, and increases the contact area between the electrolyte and active sites. Meanwhile, benefiting from the synergistic effect of multi-metals and the heterostructure, Co-PBA@NiFe-LDH-30 demonstrated remarkable electrochemical performance with a lower overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1.) This design strategy provides a promising approach for the development of OER electrocatalysts in the future.

TI Stretchable fiber-shaped aqueous aluminum ion batteries
SO ECOMAT
AB The emerging wearable electronics have significantly motivated the development of fiber-shaped batteries with excellent electrochemical performance, safety, and flexibility. Aluminum (Al) ion batteries are potential candidates due to their high natural abundance, three-electron-redox behavior, and low cost. However, the integration of Al ion battery into wearable electronics remains unexplored. Herein, a stretchable fiber-shaped aqueous Al ion battery is reported, which involves manganese hexacyanoferrate cathode, graphene oxide decorated MoO3 anode, and hydrogel electrolyte. The resulting fiber-shaped battery exhibits good stretching properties and cycling stability (91.6% over 100 cycles at 1 A cm(-3)). Moreover, by employing a rocking-chair energy storage mechanism, the fiber-shaped battery offers a high specific capacity of 42 mAh cm(-3) at 0.5 A cm(-3), corresponding to a high specific energy of 30.6 mWh cm(-3). As a demonstration, the fiber-based Al ion batteries are integrated into wearable textiles to power LED light, demonstrating the feasibility in stretchable and wearable electronics.

TI Reduced Graphene Oxide-Anchored Manganese Hexacyanoferrate with Low
   Interstitial H2O for Superior Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Low-cost manganese hexacyanoferrate (NMHCF) possesses many favorable advantages including high theoretical capacity, ease of preparation, and robust open channels that enable faster Na+ diffusion kinetics. However, high lattice water and low electronic conductivity are the main bottlenecks to their pragmatic realization. Here, we present a strategy by anchoring NMHCF on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to alleviate these problems, featuring a specific discharge capacity of 161/121 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 20/200 mA g(-1). Moreover, the sodiation process is well revealed by ex situ X-ray diffraction, EIS and Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations. At a rate of 20 mA g(-1) the hard carbon//NMHCF/RGO full cell affords a stable discharge capacity of 84 mA h g(-1) (based on the weights of cathode mass) over SO cycles, thus highlighting NMHCF/RGO an alternative cathode for sodium-ion batteries.

TI Selective cesium extraction from highly saline solution using hybrid
   capacitive deionization with zinc-doped manganese hexacyanoferrate
   electrode
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Recently, hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI) has garnered significant attention for its potential in the selective extraction of cesium (Cs) from radioactive wastewater and salt lakes, which is crucial for resolving the supply-demand imbalance of cesium resources and eliminating radioactive contamination. However, developing HCDI electrodes capable of effectively separating and extracting Cs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we proposed an innovative strategy involving the doping of inactive metal ions to develop zinc-doped manganese hexacyanoferrate (ZMFC) as an HCDI cathode. This approach leveraged the synergistic effects of ion sieving of three-dimensional lattice and zinc doping to regulate electrochemical activity, enabling the selective electrochemical extraction of Cs+ ions from highly saline solutions. The optimized ZMFC-0.1 electrodes exhibited a maximum electrosorption capacity of 299.9 mg g-1 in a 400 mg L-1 Cs+ ion solution and maintained a highcapacity retention rate of 80.1 % after 50 consecutive absorption-desorption cycles in a 200 mg L-1 Cs+ ion solution. Moreover, ZMFC-0.1 showed a high selectivity coefficient of 27.4 at a Cs+/Na+ molar ratio of 1:40. Density functional theory (DFT) simulation revealed that manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) retains high stability and electrochemical activity following zinc atom doping. In-situ X-ray diffraction and theoretical calculations provided deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying reversible capacitive adsorption and selective Cs+ ion separation. The effectiveness of cesium selective extraction from brine in Xizang suggests that the ZMFC0.1 electrodes hold significant promise for cesium recovery from salt lakes. This work presents a promising strategy for the electrochemical extraction of cesium from radioactive wastewater and salt lakes.

TI Enhanced Performance of KVPO4F0.5O0.5 in Potassium Batteries by Carbon
   Coating Interfaces
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Potassium vanadium oxyfluoride phosphate of composition KVPO4F0.5O0.5 was modified by a carbon coating to enhance its electrochemical performance. Two distinct methods were used, first, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using acetylene gas as a carbon precursor and second, an aqueous route using an abundant, cheap, and green precursor (chitosan) followed by a pyrolysis step. The formation of a 5 to 7 nm-thick carbon coating was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and it was found to be more homogeneous in the case of CVD using acetylene gas. Indeed, an increase of the specific surface area of one order of magnitude, low content of C sp2, and residual oxygen surface functionalities were observed when the coating was obtained using chitosan. Pristine and carbon-coated materials were compared as positive electrode materials in potassium half-cells cycled at a C/5 (C = 26.5 mA g-1) rate within a potential window of 3 to 5 V vs K+/K. The formation by CVD of a uniform carbon coating with the limited presence of surface functions was shown to improve the initial coulombic efficiency up to 87% for KVPFO4F0.5O0.5-C2H2 and to mitigate electrolyte decomposition. Thus, performance at high C-rates such as 10 C was significantly improved, with similar to 50% of the initial capacity maintained after 10 cycles, whereas a fast capacity loss is observed for the pristine material.

TI Structure analysis and cesium adsorption mechanism evaluation of sodium
   copper ferrocyanide
SO JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY
AB Efficient removal of Cs-137 from radioactive wastewater and seawater environments is of great significance to environmental protection and human health. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an adsorbent with large adsorption capacity and high adsorption efficiency. However, the development of high-performance adsorbents depends on the understanding of their adsorption mechanisms. There is currently no systematic evidence for the mechanism by which sodium cupric ferrocyanide adsorbs cesium. In this paper, the adsorption mechanism of cesium was systematically studied by the synergistic analysis of ICP-MS, Raman, FT-IR, XRD, XPS, TGA and SEM using sodium cupric ferrocyanide prepared in the laboratory. We observed for the first time that after the adsorption of cesium ions by sodium cupric ferrocyanide, the cyano band of the Raman spectrum showed a distinct Cs-CN sub-peak. At the same time, the relative intensities of the Na-CN sub-peaks decreased significantly, while those of Fe-CN and Cu-CN barely changed. This result is consistent with the results shown by ICP-MS and confirms the fact that sodium ions exchange with cesium ions. The results of XRD, XPS, TG and FT-IR confirmed that the ion exchange did not cause structural damage, which indicated that the cesium adsorption process was a pure ion exchange. In addition, we also found that 0.493% of the total amount of cesium adsorbed may be due to the contribution of defect vacancies.

TI Silver hexacyanoferrate (II) nanocrystals as a new material to improve
   Raman scattering enhancement during silver surface oxidation
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Raman spectroscopy is a powerful analysis technique that shows its full potential when a high amplification of the Raman signal is achieved. In this sense, Surface-Enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been the most widely used phenomenon for analysis. SERS provides the amplification of the Raman intensity due to the interaction of molecules with a plasmonic nanostructured surface. The enhancement of the Raman signal can be also obtained during the electrochemical oxidation of a metal electrode; this phenomenon was denoted as Electrochemical -Surface Oxidation Enhanced Raman Scattering (EC-SOERS) and yields a good Raman signal enhancement with high reproducibility. Until now, only chloride and bromide have been employed in EC-SOERS, using a silver electrode to generate silver chloride and silver bromide nanocrystals. In this work, a new EC-SOERS substrate based on the electrogeneration of silver hexacyanoferrate (II) nanocrystals is presented which provides a very sensitive Raman response. The electrogeneration of this new material can be easily followed using spec-troelectrochemistry since the characteristic Raman bands of the nanocrystals lie outside of the fingerprint region used for the analysis where the detection of most of the target molecules is performed. Indigo Carmine has been selected as target molecule, obtaining a very good response at nanomolar level under Raman resonance and non -resonance conditions.

TI A flexible and high voltage symmetric supercapacitor based on hybrid
   configuration of cobalt hexacyanoferrate/reduced graphene oxide
   hydrogels
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Flexible solid-state supercapacitor (FSSC) holds great promise as power source to supply the next generation of portable and wearable electronics. Assembling asymmetric supercapacitor constructed with broadening cell voltage (V) is the promising way to increase the energy density. However, the imparity reaction kinetics between EDLC and pseudocapacitive materials will further lead to inferior power density. Hence, to pursue higher working voltage and energy density, a hybrid configuration of cobalt hexacyanoferrate/reduced graphene oxide hydrogels (PB-Co/rGOH) is prepared through a one-pot hydrothermal method. With highly interconnected 3D network structure, excellent mechanical robustness and the synergistic effects between the graphene and PB-Co, the resultant PB-Co/rGOH exhibits a high specific capacitance of 220 F g(-1) and well cycle stability (83% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g(-1)). Moreover, the assembled PB-Co/rGOH//PB-Co/rGOH symmetric flexibly solid-state supercapacitor exhibits an amazing higher working voltage of 2.0 V and a remarkable energy density of 57.5 Wh kg(-1), which is comparable with that of Ni/MH batteries (60-120 Wh kg(-1)). These excellent electrochemical performances of the hybrid electrode provide a rational design strategy for developing supercapacitors with high energy density.

TI Synthesis of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanostructure on carbon cloth with
   predeposited nickel nanoparticles as precursor for binder-free
   high-performance supercapacitor electrodes
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Transition metal (TM) hexacyanoferrates (TM-HCF) have been proven efficient electrode materials for super-capacitors, especially in neutral electrolyte. In this work, nickel hexacyanoferrate (Ni-HCF) with ultra-high mass-loading was synthesized on carbon cloth (CC) with nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) as the precursor, which were in-situ converted to Ni-HCF with graphene oxide (GO) as the oxidant and NiNPs as the reductant in the presence of potassium ferricyanide. First, NiNPs were potentiostatically electrodeposited on CC. Then, the electrodeposited NiNPs was oxidized to Ni2+ by GO. The produced Ni2+ reacted immediately with potassium ferricyanide to form nanostructured nickel hexacyanoferrate. By tuning the electrodeposition time of NiNPs, the mass of the finally produced Ni-HCF can be easily adjusted. In this work, the mass-loading of Ni-HCF supported on CC reaches up to 26.4 mg cm(-2). As the positive electrode, Ni-HCF/CC possesses a high areal capacity of 6.9 C cm(-2) at a discharge current density of 10 mA cm(-2), excellent cycling stability with 81% of its initial capacitance after 2000 continuous charge/discharge cycles, ultrahigh energy density of 36 W h kg(-1) at the power density of 200 W kg(-1) and nearly 100% columbic efficiency. The superior energy storage capability of Ni-HCF indicates its promising prospect as the positive electrode material of high performance supercapacitors. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB The preparation of inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and stable electro-catalysts is crucial for realizing large-scale practical applications of Zn-air batteries. Herein, Co nanoparticles are successfully encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanofibers by electrospinning technique. The obtained material has the characteristics of stable fibrous structure, abundant active centers and fast electron transport. As expected, Co@HPCNFs-800 exhibits high catalytic activity with its initial potential (0.925 V) and onset half-wave potential (0.824 V). Meanwhile, the stability of Co@HPCNFs-800 is significantly higher than commercial Pt/C. Most importantly, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries using Co@HPCNFs-800 catalyst exhibit good open-circuit voltage and cycling stability, demonstrating their potential for practical application. Therefore, this facile method can generally be used to synthesize non-noble metal electrocatalysts to improve energy conversion efficiency.

TI Single-Crystal Lattice Filling in Connected Spaces inside 3D Networks
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Connected vessel effects have been widely utilized from ancient times. It is quite interesting to know whether there are any special effects when single-crystal lattices fill the connected spaces inside 3D networks. In some single-crystal and 3D network pairs, there seems to exist a specific rule: when single-crystal lattices fill the connected spaces inside 3D networks, the front of the lattice in each channel is determined by the symmetrical center of the lattice structure. However, this needs to be validated by using various single-crystal lattice to fill the 3D networks with different compositions. Here we report a method to establish a gradient environment which can favor the formation of a micrometer-sized single crystal lattice across various 3D networks. The fronts of the filled lattices form the shapes which are the equilibrium shapes of the single crystals no matter what the single crystals or the 3D networks are, indicating the specific rule while the single-crystal lattices fill the 3D networks. The single crystals filled in the connected spaces inside 3D networks, which are functional materials, and had alternating properties, such as 4-fold higher electronic conductivity, which improve their performance in applications.

TI Chemical and Electrochemical Alkali Cations Intercalation/Release in an
   Ionic Hydrogen Bonded Network
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The chemical oxidation of a hydrogen bonded network, formed upon combination of a hydrogen bond donor dication (1(2+), a dicationic bis-amidinium organic moiety bearing four propyl chains) with [Fe-III/II(CN)(6)](3-/4-) anions has been studied using vibrational spectroscopies. The postsynthetic oxidation of the microcrystalline powder of X(2)1(3)-[Fe-II(CN)(6)](2) (X = Na, K, and Cs) by S2O82- into 1(3)-[Fe-III(CN)(6)](2) appeared to be partial for X = K+ and Cs+ and total for Na(2)1(3)-[Fe-II(CN)(6)](2). It corresponds to a two-step process involving a second order reaction. The reaction time appears to be dependent on the nature of the alkali cation and is faster for X = Na+. The integrity of the hydrogen bonded network, after oxidation, was also confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction. The flexible nature of the hydrogen bonded network allows alkali cation motions within the network during the oxidation process. In addition, the investigation of the electrochemical behavior evidenced an amorphous deposition on a gold electrode immersed into a solution containing (1(2+) and [Fe-III(CN)(6)](3-)) after 100 cycles. This is the first evidence of an electrochemical ion intercalation for a molecular hydrogen bonded network.

TI Graphene-Supported Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> Intercalated
   V2O5 Nanoribbons as Cathode for Aqueous Zinc-Ion
   Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have shown potential applications in energy storage systems due to their lower cost and higher safety, but their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of the cathode material. Herein, we propose V2O5 nanoribbons with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets encapsulating and magnesium ions (Mg2+) inserting between the V2O5 molecular layers. The rGO outside has an excellent electrical conductivity to obtain high reaction kinetically and alleviates the anode dissolution problem, while the magnesium ions inside increase the V2O5 layer spacing and support the molecular layer structure, which finally significantly improves the structural stability. The graphene-supported Mg2+ intercalated V2O5 nanoribbon composite (MVG) electrode delivers the reversible capacity (530 mAh g(-1) specific capacity at 0.1 A g(-1) current density), unbelievable cycle (89% retention of capacity after 5000 cycles at 5 A g(-1)), and extraordinary power and energy density (441 Wh kg(-)(1) and 5028.46 W kg(-)(1), respectively). The excellent electrochemical performance proves that MVG is a more suitable cathode material for AZIBs. The combined internal and external modification strategy also provides an idea for the generation of superior cathode materials for AZIBs.

TI MCM-41-supported double metal cyanide nanocomposite catalyst for
   ring-opening polymerisation of propylene oxide
SO JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH
AB The fabrication of low-cost, recyclable, reusable, and heterogeneous catalysts is of considerable significance for green chemistry. In this study, a nanocomposite catalyst, MCM-41-supported Zn-Co double metal cyanide (MCM-41@DMC), was prepared using the synchronous dropping method. Thereafter, the composition, crystal structure, complexing state, morphology, and thermal stability of the catalyst were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, and thermogravimetry. The effects of different organic ligands on the catalytic activity of samples were evaluated, and the results showed that ethyl acetoacetate exhibited the best catalytic activity owing to its ketone coordination. The use of the MCM-41 support was beneficial for improving the catalytic activity because it reduced the crystallinity and substantially increased the external specific surface area of the catalyst. The experimental results pertaining to the use of the MCM-41@DMC catalyst in the fabrication of polypropylene glycol showed that the conversion of propylene oxide and molecular weight reached 90.6% and 2900, respectively. This study provides a new strategy for the green synthesis of poly(propylene glycol) products.

TI Effect of synthesis pH and EDTA on iron hexacyanoferrate for sodium-ion
   batteries
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) particles were synthesized at room temperature with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at varying pH. The presence of EDTA produced faceted particles and increasing synthesis pH resulted in slower reaction kinetics and larger particles with lower water content and fewer anion vacancies determined by TGA and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Electrochemical testing of sodium metal half cells revealed higher capacity in FeHCF particles grown at lower pH with EDTA, obtaining a maximum discharge capacity of 151 mA h g(-1) with 79% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) and a rate capability of 122 mA h g(-1) at 3.2 A g(-1). In contrast, particles grown at higher pH had stunted low-spin Fe redox activity but with improved long-term cyclic stability. These findings demonstrate that small changes in synthesis pH can greatly affect the growth and electrochemical properties of FeHCF when using a pH sensitive chelating agent such as EDTA.

TI Double-metal cyanide-supported Pd catalysts for highly efficient
   hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of biomass-derived furanic aldehydes to
   cyclopentanone compounds
SO JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB The hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of biomass-derived furanic aldehydes (furfural or 5-hydroxymethyl furfural) to cyclopentanone compounds (cyclopentanone or 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone) is of great significance for high-value chemicals. The Bronsted acid in metal-support bifunctional catalysts causes a serious carbon loss, and the weak Lewis acid is difficult to induce hydrolysis reaction steps. Here, a double-metal cyanide (DMC) catalyst with pure moderate Lewis acid sites was investigated for solving the above problems. The crystal structure and the Lewis acidity of the catalyst are controlled by different kinds of metals, and the surface properties are changed by a complexing effect. Pd clusters of 8 nm are uniformly dispersed on the surface after impregnation on the double-metal cyanide. For the reaction of furanic aldehydes, the Pd/FeZn-DMC catalyst with a moderate Lewis acidity shows a high efficiency for the synthesis of cyclopentanone compounds, whereas the Pd/FeNi-DMC and Pd/FeCo-DMC catalysts with a weak Lewis acidity result in a yield above 90.2% of furanic alcohols (furfuryl alcohol or 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan). The catalytic activity of Pd/FeZn-DMC is controlled by the surface area based on the accessibility of the Lewis acid sites, and the highest yields of 96.6% and 87.5% are obtained for cyclopentanone and 3-hydroxymethyl cyclopentanone, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst is resistant to leaching and performs stably after 6 runs. This study not only provides a promising route for efficient production of cyclopentanone compounds but also shows the excellent advantage of DMC-based bifunctional catalysis in biomass conversion reactions.

TI Metal-Organic Framework Derived Multicomponent Nanoagent as a Reactive
   Oxygen Species Amplifier for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy
SO ACS NANO
AB Intracellular antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) play a critical role in protecting malignant tumor cells from apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in mechanisms of multidrug and radiation resistance. Herein, we rationally design two multicomponent self-assembled photo dynamic therapy (PDT) nanoagents, that is, Glup-MFi-c and Glud-MFo-c, which consist of respective GSH-passivation and GSH-depletion l linkers in metal organic frameworks encapsulated with photosensitizers for a deeply comprehensive understanding of GSH-based tumor PDT. Multicomponent coordination, pi-pi stacking, and electrostatic interactions among metal ions, photo sensitizers, and bridging linkers under the protection of a biocompatible polymer generate homogeneous nanoparticles with satisfied size, good colloid stability, and ultrahigh loading capacity. Compared to the GSH-passivated Ginp-MFi-c, the GSH-depleted Glud-MFo-c shows pH-responsive release of Photosensitizer and [Fe-III(CN)(6)] linker in tumor cells to efficiently deplete intracellular GSH, thus amplifying the cell-killing efficiency of ROS and suppressing the tumor growth in vivo. This study demonstrates that Glud-MFo-c acts as a ROS amplifier, Providing a useful strategy to deeply understand the role of GSH in combating cancer.

TI Carbon-Based Porous Bimetallic Phosphide in CNT Network as a Separator
   for Li-S Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have received continuous attention due to their high theoretical specific capacity. However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) severely limits its development. Modification of commercial polypropylene (PP) separators is regarded as an effective strategy to suppress the shuttle effect. In this paper, NiFe-PBA-derived carbon-based porous bimetallic phosphide (NFP) was inserted into the carbon nanotube (CNT) networks, and these composites were utilized to modify the PP separator. CNT networks provide abundant pathways of electron transport to improve the conductivity of S cathode and Li2S. Ni2P and Fe2P in NFP exhibit robust chemisorption and catalytic effects on LiPSs. Moreover, porous structures and networks were beneficial for Li+ immigration. The synergistic effects of NFP and CNT networks enable the modified separator to obtain a high electrical conductivity, superior adsorption capability, and enhanced catalytic performance. Assembled Li-S batteries show a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1244 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. Notably, the highest discharge-specific capacity reached up to 938.9 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, and the average capacity decay rate per cycle after 300 cycles was a mere 0.067%. This study paves the way for a robust research pathway in harnessing transition metal phosphides and carbon materials for modified separators, offering an effective strategy to realize high-performance Li-S batteries.

TI Imaging the Magnetic Reversal of Isolated and Organized Molecular-Based
   Nanoparticles using Magnetic Force Microscopy
SO PARTICLE & PARTICLE SYSTEMS CHARACTERIZATION
AB In the race towards miniaturization in nanoelectronics, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have emerged as potential candidates for their integration in ultrahigh-density recording media. Molecular-based materials open the possibility to design new tailor-made MNPs with variable composition and sizes, which benefit from the intrinsic properties of these materials. Before their implementation in real devices is reached, a precise organization on surfaces and a reliable characterization and manipulation of their individual magnetic behavior are required. In this paper, it is demonstrated how molecular-based MNPs are accurately organized on surfaces and how the magnetic properties of the individual MNPs are detected and tuned by means of low-temperature magnetic force microscopy (LT-MFM) with variable magnetic field. The magnetization reversal on isolated and organized MNPs is investigated; in addition, the temperature dependence of their magnetic response is evaluated.

   sensitive detection of methyl parathion in diverse matrices
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO
AB This study addresses the environmental and health concerns associated with the pesticide methyl parathion (MP) by exploring electrochemical sensing using a novel MnCuFe/P-GCE sensor. Derived from MnCuFe-PBA phosphidation, the MnCuFe/P sensor exhibited exceptional electrochemical performance for MP detection. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicated improved electrical conductivity post-phosphidation, enhancing charge transfer kinetics.

AB A MOF material, Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanoparticles has been prepared for the effective detection of ethanol in vapor phase. When exposed to ethanol vapor, the material was changed from pink to purple, which is easily observed by naked eyes directly. We propose that the ethanol response is due to ethanol molecules entering the pores of the solid, where they alter the coordination geometry, leading to conversion of their Co centers from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination. Significantly, the change is reversible, which make the material reusable without subjecting to dynamic vacuum or slightly warming. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI VS4/carbon nanotube hybrid: A high-rate anode for sodium-ion battery
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB VS4 with high theoretical capacity and unique parallel quasi-one-dimensional (1D) chains structure has the potential to serve as the sodium ion battery (SIB) anode, yet the realization of its full electrochemical property is hampered by the poor electrical conductivity and sever volume expansion during cycling. To improve the conductivity and structure stability of VS4, multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) is introduced. As a result, the structure stability and charge transfer kinetics during cycling are enhanced. The synthesized VS4/MWCNT composite achieves a relatively high discharge capacity of 680 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1, and excellent rate capability of 368 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. Characterization reveals the predominant surface control behavior of sodium storage and enhanced charge carriers' mobilities for VS4/MWCNT. Based on these results, the VS4/MWCNT composite offers vast potential as a promising anode for rechargeable SIBs.

TI Interface Engineering between the Metal-Organic Framework Nanocrystal
   and Graphene toward Ultrahigh Potassium-Ion Storage Performance
SO ACS NANO
AB The potassium-ion battery (PIB) has been recognized as a promising low-cost and high-energy battery; however, it suffers from a relatively low capacity and inferior cycling performance compared with current electrode materials. Herein, we report an effective interface engineering strategy to prepare metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals tightly encapsulated by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via strong chemical interaction as a free-standing anode for PIB. Based on experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, we systematically investigated the effect of the chemical-bonded interface between MOF nanocrystals and conductive rGO and revealed that the strong chemical interface can substantially enhance the adsorption energy and ion transport kinetics of the potassium ion within the MOF nanocrystals compared to the physical mixture of MOF and rGO with almost the same microscopic morphologies. As a result, such an MOF-rGO hybrid with strong interfacial chemical couplings delivered an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 422 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), superior rate performance (202 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)), and outstanding long-term cycling performance (an ultralow decay rate of 0.013% per cycle after 2000 cycles at 2 A g(-1)), which are not only significantly better than those of the physical mixture of MOF/rGO but also among the best for anodes for PIB reported thus far.

TI Multiple interfacial Fe3C/MnO/NC composites towards high-performance
   microwave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Exploring high-performance electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbers remains a formidable challenge in the face of severe EMW radiation and interference. The incorporation of manganese oxide into carbon matrix magnetic composites is proposed to enhance the EMW absorption properties in this work. Multiple interfacial ternarycomponent Fe3C/MnO/Nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) absorbers were synthesized through facile hydrothermal, oxidative polymerization and carbothermal reduction processes. The results indicated that the composites designed exhibit excellent EMW absorption properties, with an effective absorption bandwidth of 4.88 GHz (13.12-18 GHz) at a mere thickness of 1.5 mm. The outstanding performance of EMW absorption can be attributed to the effective modulation of electromagnetic parameters through a large number of heterogeneous interfaces, defects, and magnetic loss. Meanwhile, adjusting the filling ratios of the composites in the absorber also can significantly adjust the electromagnetic parameters of the samples.

TI New rotating disk hematite film electrode for riboflavin detection
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The motivation for this work was to develop and test a hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) film electrode for the detection of riboflavin using a less common preparation with rotating disk electrode linear sweep voltammetry. Two types of hematite electrodes were prepared, with a differential method and a one-step method (quicker preparation), and bare glassy carbon electrodes were used for comparison. The differential and one-step hematite electrodes were tested for cyclic voltammetry stability. Colloidal hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) was synthesized from iron nitrate nonahydrate from a two-line ferrihydrite transition and characterized with X-ray powder diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Both hematite film electrodes were prepared using a three-electrode electrochemical cell and rotating disk voltammetry. Rotating disk hematite electrode stability was demonstrated for up to 1000 cyclic voltammetry scans. A single use of the rotating disk hematite film electrode was shown to demonstrate quantitatively the detection of riboflavin reduction peaks with optimized differential square wave voltammetry. The limits of detection for the glassy carbon and rotating disk hematite film electrodes for riboflavin are 0.0028 +/- 0.0009 mM and 0.0084 +/- 0.0009 mM, respectively. The detection linear range for the glassy carbon and rotating disk hematite film electrodes is 0.0013-0.1 mM riboflavin. The sensitivities of the one-step and differential rotating disk hematite film electrodes are 0.216 +/- 0.001 mu A/mu M and 0.27 +/- 0.02 mu A/mu M riboflavin, respectively. The sensitivity of the bare glassy carbon electrode is 0.144 +/- 0.003 mu A/mu M riboflavin.

TI Rational design of yolk-shell
   NiCo2O4@void@NiCo2S4
   nanospheres for effective enhancement in microwave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB An efficient strategy for the synthesis of rational designed yolk-shell nanospheres with NiCo2O4 core and NiCo2S4 shell has been developed in this work. Firstly, NiCo2O4 solid nanospheres are synthesized as precursors, and then the yolk-shell NiCo2O4@void@NiCo2S4 nanospheres are obtained by further controllable sulfidation process. Combing the dielectric losses arising from the dielectric materials of NiCo2O4, NiCo2S4 and the extraordinary polarization losses generating between the core and shell in rational designed yolk shell structure, the optimized NiCo2O4@void@NiCo2S4 composite samples by exactly controlling the sulfidation time can exhibit the superior microwave absorption properties. It is worth noting that the optimal Refection Loss (RL) value of NiCo2O4@void@NiCo2S4 composites could achieve -58.5 dB at 7.76 GHz with a thickness of 2.8 mm and the absorption bandwidth for RL < -10 dB could range from 11.6 GHz to 18 GHz (6.4 GHz) with a thickness of 1.9 mm. The as-synthesized NiCo2O4@void@NiCo2S4 composite with proper sulfidation time could be a promising microwave attenuation material with strong dielectric loss capability and wide absorbing bandwidth.

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The Na2MnFe(CN)(6) is successfully synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method, and then coated with conducting polymers (PPy) on the surface of Na2MnFe(CN)(6) particle. Interestingly, Na2MnFe(CN)(6) and Na2MnFe(CN)(6)@PPy both show hollow octahedral hierarchical structures with nanometer-sized subunits. Na2MnFe(CN)(6)@PPy exhibits a discharge capacity of 107 mAh center dot g(-1) after 150 cycles at a current density of 10 mA center dot g(-1). It can still remain 65 mAh center dot g(-1) even the current density is increased to 200 mA center dot g(-1). This superior electrochemical property could be ascribed to unique hierarchical architecture as well as improved electronic conductivity.

TI <SUP>1</SUP>CoFe/C Nanosheets on Hollow Carbon Fibers as Composite
   Fabrics for Electromagnetic Interference Shielding
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding material with good flexibility and lightweight is an effective way to eliminate electromagnetic pollution sources. Herein, lightweight, flexible, and strong CoFe/C/HCF composites with hierarchical pore structures were constructed by in situ growth, etching/ion exchange reaction, and high-temperature pyrolysis using cotton fabric (CF) as the substrate. The Co-MOF nanosheet was in situ grown on the surface of CF, and CoFe-LDH nanosheets were formed after the etching/ion-exchange reaction. CoFe/C/HCF composites with hierarchical pore structures were obtained after high-temperature pyrolysis. The hierarchical pore structure was verified using small-angle neutron scattering analysis. The unique hierarchical pore structure and strong interfacial interaction make the composites have higher average shielding efficiency (SE) and specific shielding efficiency (SSE), when the thickness is only 0.9 mm, which reached 30.7 dB and 109.64 dBmiddotcm(3) g(-1), respectively. Meanwhile, ultrafast photothermal performance is also achieved, which can ensure the normal function of the composite material in cold conditions. This work provides possibilities for the potential applications of CoFe/C/HCF composites in flexible sensing and wearable smart electronics.

TI Resolving the Role of Configurational Entropy in Improving Cycling
   Performance of Multicomponent Hexacyanoferrate Cathodes for Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Mn-based hexacyanoferrate (Mn-HCF) cathodes for Na-ion batteries usually suffer from poor reversibility and capacity decay resulting from unfavorable phase transitions and structural degradation during cycling. To address this issue, the high-entropy concept is here applied to Mn-HCF materials, significantly improving the sodium storage capabilities of this system via a solid-solution mechanism with minor crystallographic changes upon de-/sodiation. Complementary structural, electrochemical, and computational characterization methods are used to compare the behavior of high-, medium-, and low-entropy multicomponent Mn-HCFs resolving, to our knowledge for the first time, the link between configurational entropy/compositional disorder (entropy-mediated suppression of phase transitions, etc.) and cycling performance/stability in this promising class of next-generation cathode materials.

TI Green Reduction of Cobalt Ferrocyanide with Excellent Electrocatalytic
   Activity toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB The development of earth-friendly efficient electro-catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) becomes crucial for renewable energy production. In this work, green synthesized reduced cobalt ferrocyanide at different time intervals (RCFC-t) was demonstrated as an effective and long-lasting electrocatalyst for the OER process. The RCFC-10 loaded glassy carbon electrode runs at an overpotential of 321 mV (1.55 V) at 10 mA cm(-2) , and a lower overpotential of 291 mV exhibited by the optimal RCFC-10/ nickel foam was almost comparable to the benchmark catalyst, such as IrO2 . This newborn RCFC-10 shows excellent OER performance and durability over 250 h with 4.1% potential loss in alkaline medium. At 1.58 V, the solar-driven water electrolysis demonstration supports the efficiency of a newborn electrocatalyst in solar-to-hydrogen conversion. These research findings confirm that low-cost greener synthesized RCFC-10/NF can be used for large-scale hydrogen generation.

TI Interpretation of the Role of Composition on the Inclusion Efficiency of
   Monovalent Cations into Cobalt Hexacyanoferrate
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Cobalt hexacyanoferrate of various compositions was prepared in flow mode and the role of the vacancy on the structure, thermogravimetric (TG) properties, and the adsorption efficiency was studied. The material, NayCo[Fe(CN)(6)](1-)z H2O, with a minimum vacancy of x=0.014 to the highest x=0.47, was obtained. The TG-differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile showed a distinct influence of the vacancy on the water release temperature. Materials with x>0.35 showed a smooth release of water at a relatively lower temperature. However, for the materials with x<0.35, water release took place in multiple steps, suggesting the existence of various forms of water. The FTIR profiles supported the existence of free and bonded water molecules. However, the materials with multiple water peaks in the FTIR spectra showed a shift of the major XRD peaks when heated at 285 degrees C in N-2 atmosphere. Regarding the effect of the vacancy on the adsorption behavior, for NH4, the adsorption was found to be proportional to the number of Na atoms in the material, confirming the ion-exchange process. On the contrary, the materials with low vacancy and high Na content showed nominal Cs adsorption capacity. Interestingly, the K adsorption capacity was found to be in between that of the other two ions. This means the ionic size decides the rate of placement into the interstitial sites. For larger ions like Cs, the ease of percolation via the vacancy decides the overall adsorption efficiency.

AB Developing highly efficient and persistent transition-metal-phosphide(TMP)-based electrocatalysts is critical for the hydrogen evolutionreaction (HER) via water splitting in alkaline media. Herein, we constructeda unique heterostructured CoFeP/CoP grown on a nickle foam (NF) viahydrothermal and dipping methods followed by phosphorization at differenttemperatures for HER. The experimental results exhibit that the HERactivity of CoFeP/CoP-400 is accelerated after the construction ofheterostructures.

CoFeP/CoP-400 displays a small overpotential of 78 mV at acurrent density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafelslope of 55.5 mV dec(-1). Moreover, CoFeP/CoP-400shows excellent stability with a long-term operating time of 12 h.This work provides an effective method for the construction of TMPswith heterostructures for promoting energy conversion.

TI A H2O2 Self-Charging Zinc Battery with Ultrafast
   Power Generation and Storage
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Self-charging power systems are considered as promising alternatives for off-grid energy devices to provide sustained electricity supply. However, the conventional self-charging systems are severely restricted by the energy availability and time-consuming charging process as well as insufficient capacity. Herein, we developed an ultrafast H2O2 self-charging aqueous Zn/NaFeFe(CN)(6) battery, which simultaneously integrates the H2O2 power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. In such battery, the chemical energy conversion of H2O2 can generate electrical energy to self-charge the battery to 1.7 V through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)(6) cathode. The thermodynamically and kinetically favorable redox reaction contributes to the ultrafast H2O2 self-charging rate and the extremely short self-charging time within 60 seconds. Moreover, the rapid H2O2 power generation can promptly compensate the energy consumption of battery to provide continuous electricity supply. Impressively, this self-charging battery shows excellent scalability of device architecture and can be designed to a H2O2 single-flow battery of 7.06 Ah to extend the long-term energy supply. This work not only provides a route to design self-charging batteries with fast charging rate and high capacity, but also pushes forward the development of self-charging power systems for advanced large-scale energy storage applications.

TI Trimetallic Metal-Organic Framework Nanoframe Superstructures: A
   Stress-Buffering Architecture Engineering of Anode Material toward
   Boosted Lithium Storage Performance
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can serve as prevailing anodes for lithium-ion batteries, due to their multiple redox-active sites and prominent structural compatibility. However, the poor electronic conductivity and inferior cyclability hinder their further implementation. Herein, a synthetic methodology for trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni MOFs with nanoframe superstructures architecture (Fe-Co-Ni NFSs) via structural evolution is proposed for versatile anode materials for lithium storage. Ascribed to optimal compositional and structural optimization, the Fe-Co-Ni NFSs achieve exceptional electrochemical performance with superior specific capacity (1030 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), outstanding rate capacity (414 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)), and prolonged cyclability (489 mAh g(-1) upon 1000 cycles at 1 A g(-1)). Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the multi-component metal centers could boost electronic conductivity, confer multiple active sites, and energetically favor Li adsorption capability. Additionally, the nanoframe superstructures of Fe-Co-Ni NFSs could facilitate stress-buffering effect on volumetric expansion and prevent electrode pulverization, further improving the lithium storage capability. This work envisions a meticulous protocol for high-performance MOF anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.

In this study, we explored a new route to obtain pseudocapacitive Mn-Co mixed oxides from thermal decomposition of manganese hexacyanocobaltate (III) in presence of activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, or graphene oxide. The heat treatment employed to form the Mn-Co oxides provokes the decomposition of the carbon structures. However, their presence during the treatment causes variation for the formed crystalline phases, decreases the particle size, and enhances the accessible surface and pore volume, improving the electrochemical behavior of the synthesized Mn-Co mixed oxides. Besides the easy processing, here-obtained mixed Mn-Co oxides exhibit remarkable energy storage characteristics. Mn-Co mixed oxide obtained in presence of graphene oxide reached the best performance, displaying capacitances of 209 F g(-1) at 0.25 A g(-1) and 135 F g(-1) at 4 A g(-1), in a 3 M KOH electrolyte. The stability of the material was tested in a two-electrode asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using biomass-derived activated carbon obtained by solar pyrolysis. The device retained 75% of the initial capacitance after 50 00 GCD cycles (i = 2.5 A g(-1)), with a columbic efficiency close to 100% and an energetic efficiency above 70%. Moreover, the device delivered a specific energy of 39.8 W h kg(-1) at a specific power of 0.2 kW kg(-1), and 19.1 W h kg(-1) at 6.6 kW kg(-1). The degradation of the asymmetric supercapacitor was evaluated using EIS. We identified a 4-fold increment of the ESR with a slight diminution of capacitance during the long-term cycling.

TI Ball-milling synthesis of ultrafine
   NayFexMn1-x[Fe(CN)6] as
   high-performance cathode in sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnPBA) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the poor electrical conductivity and the structural instability greatly hinder its practical applications in SIBs. In this work, a facile ball-milling method is used to synthesize the ultrafine NayFexMn1-x[Fe(CN)(6)] without additional additives. It shows that the ultrafine particles (similar to 50 nm) favor the fast Na+ diffusion in MnPBA, while Fe-doping can enhance the electrical conductivity and suppress the structure distortion upon Na+ insertion/extraction. Thus, Fe-doped MnPBA demonstrates greatly improved electrochemical stability and kinetics. Especially, Fe-MnPBA/0.4 can deliver a specific capacity of 119 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, corresponding to an energy density of similar to 380 Wh kg(-1) in half-cell. Even at a current density of 30 C, its specific capacity still retains 86 mA h g(-1). Our work provides a facile strategy to massively synthesize the PBAs on a large scale with excellent sodium-ion storage performance.
   Ultrafine NayFexMn1-x[Fe(CN)(6)] synthesized via a dry-milling method without additives exhibits excellent rate performance and cycling stability. Fe-MnPBA/0.4 can deliver a specific capacity of 119 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and retain 86 mA h g(-1) at 30 C.

TI MgO-Coated Layered Cathode Oxide With Enhanced Stability for Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is a prospective layered cathode material for sodium-ion batteries owing to its low cost, ease of synthesis, and high specific capacity. However, due to direct contact with electrolytes during the cycling process, the cyclic stability is not satisfied. To address this issue, magnesium oxide (MgO) surface modification was performed in this study to improve the material's cycling properties. MgO layers of various thicknesses were successfully coated onto the cathode, and their electrochemical performances were thoroughly investigated. Among the as-prepared samples, the 2 wt% MgO-coated sample demonstrated the best rate capability and cycling stability. It had an initial reversible discharge capacity of 105 mAh g(-1) in the voltage range from 2.0 to 4.5 V at 0.2 C with a high cycle retention of 81.5%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results showed that the 2 wt% MgO-coated electrode had the highest conductivity due to the smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) value. All the test results show that the MgO modification improves the electrochemical properties of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode material. This research could lead to the development of a promising strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of next-generation sodium-ion batteries.

TI A new isotropic negative thermal expansion material of CaSnF6
   with facile and low-cost synthesis
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Double ReO3-type fluorides have a great interest in the field of negative thermal expansion (NTE) and luminescent materials. However, their application is limited by the scarcity of quantity, expensive raw materials, and harsh preparation conditions. In this work we have found a new NTE material, CaSnF6, by applying the concept of the average atomic volume. More importantly, different from the previous solid-phase sintering and direct fluorination methods, the nano CaSnF6 has been synthesized for the first time by solvothermal method. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy show that a phase transition occurs from rhombohedral (R (3) over bar) to cubic (Fm (3) over barm) structure at about 200 K, and a strong isotropic NTE (alpha(nu) = -15.78 x 10(-6) K-1) appears in the cubic phase. Lattice dynamics calculations from first-principles illustrate that the NTE is due to the transverse vibration of fluorine atoms excited by low-frequency phonons. This work not only broadens the NTE family of fluorides, but also provides a new facile and low-cost fabricati on method for the preparation of NTE fluorides.

TI Synergistic regulation of low-defects manganese hexacyanoferrates with
   stable electrode/electrolyte interface for enhancing electrochemical
   potassium storage performance
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (K-MnHCF) has been considered as a promising cathode material for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) on account of their high potential and capacity, but suffers from the poor cyclic performance. Herein, a synergistic strategy combining the defects-reducing of K-MnHCF together with the electrode/electrolyte interface-stabilizing is developed to boost the electrochemical potassium-ions storage performance. By adjusting the co-precipitation process, K-MnHCF displays the regular cubic particle with the size of 100-150 nm, exhibiting the reversable capacity of 95 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 in KPF6 electrolyte system. Stabilizing the interface between K-MnHCF cathode material and electrolyte is further applied to enhance the cyclic stability and coulombic efficiency (97.6 %) of K-MnHCF cathode, by reducing the side reactions at the interface in high concentration KFSI electrolyte system. This work provides a strategy to boost the electrochemical potassium-ions storage performance of PIB cathode by synergistic stabilizing of the cathode material and the electrode/electrolyte interface.

TI Combined performance of circularly polarized luminescence and proton
   conduction in homochiral cadmium(II)-terbium(III) complexes
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Multifunctional materials with proton conduction, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and a magneto-optical Faraday effect would provide a great opportunity for applications in luminescent, electrical, magneto-optical and optical-electronic smart devices. However, such types of multifunctional systems have rarely been reported. Herein, by introducing a chiral amine-phenol ligand, a pair of Cd(ii)-Tb(iii) enantiomers, [Cd2Tb(RR/SS-H2L)(2)(H2O)(6)](ClO4)(3)<middle dot>2H(2)O (R-1 and S-1) [H2L = ((SS/RR)-cyclohexane-1,2-diylbis(azanediyl)-bis(methylene)-bis(2-methoxyphenol))], were obtained. R-1 and S-1 feature the homochiral molecules of trinuclear Cd2Tb structures, which contain abundant H-bonds to form three-dimensional (3D) supermolecular frameworks. They are chiral multifunctional materials showing strong Tb(iii) characteristic emissions, a moderate proton conductivity of 1.17 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 333 K and 100% RH for R-1, CPL with a luminescence dissymmetry factor value of over 10(-3) for R-1 and S-1 and a strong magneto-optical Faraday effect, and they are the first known materials simultaneously showing CPL, proton conduction and the Faraday effect.

TI Proton-assisted mixed-valence vanadium oxides cathode with long-term
   stability for rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB In this work, we developed a rGO assisted vanadium oxide xerogel (abbreviate as VOHG) as cathode material for rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (RA-ZIBs). The VOHG cathode exhibits an ultra-high specific capacity of 625 mA h g-1 at current density of 0.1 A g-1, superior reversibility and a long cycle life with a coulombic efficiency of 100.0% after 10,000 cycles. The VOHG material has mixed valent vanadium ions V4+/V5+and a layer structure with interlayer water. The interlayer water acts as soft support for the VO6 octahedron, forming a large space in the layers for H+/Zn2+ intercalation, which improves the migration rate of Zn2+ due to its charge shielding effect. Protons can move quickly through the interlayer water network by Grotthuss proton transport mechanism. The application of the unique structure of VOHG makes zinc ions battery will be a promising candidate of energy storage device with high-capacity and long cycle stability.

TI Synergistic activation of peroxymonosulfate by nickel-cobalt
   hexacyanoferrate derived hybrid metal oxides for efficient
   sulfamethoxazole degradation
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB The development of a heterogeneous catalyst for efficient activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) is still highly desired in metal-based advanced oxidation processes. In this study, nickel-cobalt-iron hybrid oxides (NiCoFe-HO) catalyst was fabricated via direct thermal decomposition of nickel-cobalt hexacyanoferrate to activate PMS for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation. NiCoFe-HO presented a much greater catalytic performance in SMX degradation with PMS under neutral pH (k = 0.079 min-1). The degradation rate of SMX with NiCoFe-HO was 2.3 and 3.0 times higher than that with nickel-iron hybrid oxides and cobalt-iron hybrid oxides, respectively. The synergistic effect among Ni, Co and Fe was experimentally verified to elucidate the superior catalytic activity. Sulfate radical and singlet oxygen were identified as the predominant reactive species in the current oxidation process. SMX degradation efficiency was gradually enhanced with the increase of catalyst dosage, PMS dosage and temperature but decreased with the increase of pH. In addition, NiCoFe-HO showed good stability and reusability. This study extends the design of hybrid metal oxides as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for PMS activation.

TI New insights into the mechanism of cesium sorption on titanium
   hexacyanoferrate: Experimental findings and model development
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This study aimed to provide new insights into the mechanism of Cs+ sorption on titanium hexacyanoferrate (Ti-Fe PBA) focusing on the influence of the structure and vacancies. Ti-Fe PBA was synthesized with specific vacancies using a coprecipitation synthesis method. The study successfully demonstrated the unique structure of Ti-Fe PBA and determined the ratio of vacancies within its framework through various characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform-infrared spectrometry, thermogravimetry, scanning elec-tron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and sodium hydroxide titration. The synthesized Ti-Fe PBA exhibited an impressive Cs+ sorption capacity of 3.53 mmol g+1 and demonstrated high selectivity, with a Kd value 1.5 x 106 for Cs+ sorption. In addition, Ti-Fe PBA displayed excellent stability, rapid uptake kinetics and maintained high selectivity, even in the presence of high concentrations of coexisting ions. Moreover, our new findings revealed that K-Cs ion exchange specifically occurring at the interstitial sites within the framework structure accounted for-35 % of the total Cs+ sorption. A sorption-surface complexation model utilizing a coupling technique that integrated PHREEQC with Python enabled in-depth analysis of titration, pH effects and sorption isotherms. The modelling results revealed that the strong ion exchange sites = SsOH and = SsONa on surfaces and vacancies contributed-65 % of the total Cs+ sorption.

TI Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery Based on a Cathode of Copper
   Hexacyanoferrate
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB In this work, the performance of copper(II) hexacyanoferrate(III) (CuHCF) as a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries was studied. The compound was synthesized by a precipitation reaction in aqueous solution in a closed system. The morphology and structure show nanoparticles with sizes between 40 and 70 nm with a high agglomeration and a crystalline phase with a cubic structure, respectively. The material exhibited a stable performance with a working potential of around 3.6 V vs Li+/Li and a decrease in the charge transfer resistance due to increased ionic conductivity. The gravimetric capacity obtained is near 60 mAh g(-1) during 300 cycles at a rate of C/20, close to the practical capacity. Considering its electrochemical performance, CuHCF could be a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.

TI Selective oxidation of organic pollutants based on reactive oxygen
   species and the molecular structure: Degradation behavior and mechanism
   analysis
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The selective and rapid elimination of refractory organic pollutants from surface water is significant. However, the relationship of between reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and diversified pollutants molecular structures still needs to be further clarified. Here, we utilize polydopamine (PDA)-assisted coating strategy to prepare hollow 2D carbon nanosheet (ZPL-HCNS) and 2D Co3O4 nanosheet (ZPL-Co3O4) by thermolysis of PDA coated ZIF-L (ZIFL@PDA) precursor under different gas atmosphere, which realizes the controlled generation of radicals and nonradicals. Organic pollutants including bisphenols, sulfonamides, quinolones, tetracyclines, and azo dyes are applied to assess the catalytic performance. Results show that dyes containing azo structure are more likely to be degraded by radical process, which is due to that the energy (Delta E) requirements to break the azo bond is higher than energy released from singlet oxygen to oxygen molecule and lower than that of sulfate radical to sulfate. Frontier molecular orbital theory HOMO-LUMO and Fukui function expounded the possible selectivity mechanism. In addition, the degradation pathway and biotoxicity test are carried out. This work provides a reference to illustrate the selective degradation for ROSs and molecular structure of pollutants.

TI Metal-organic framework derived hollow CoFe@C composites by the tunable
   chemical composition for efficient microwave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Controlling the composition and microstructure of nanomaterials is still a significant challenge in developing high-performance microwave absorption (MA) materials. Herein, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived hollow CoFe@C nanoboxes are designed and prepared through the facile regulating the mass ratios of ZIF-67/PFC and a thermal annealing treatment. The CoFe@C composite can achieve an excellent MA performance, which have two high reflection loss (RL) values at different thickness. A RL value of -31.0 dB is obtained at 11.84 GHz with a matching thickness of 2.4 mm, and a RL value can reach -44.1 dB (4.08 GHz) at a matching thickness of 5.8 mm, and a correspondingly wide absorbing bandwidth (5.20 GHz, from 9.7 to 14.9 GHz) is simultaneously obtained at a matching thickness of 2.3 mm. The magnetic loss, interfacial polarization and hollow structure are the main reasons for their excellent MA capability. This work provides a research idea for the development of the efficient MOF-based MA materials in practical application.

TI Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate as ultra-high rate host for aqueous
   proton storage
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Rechargeable aqueous proton batteries (APBs) are a fairly promising electrochemical storage system that deserves to be developed vigorously due to their unique Grotthuss proton conduction, potential performance, and abundant resources. Therefore, it is requisite to find suitable cathode materials for proton storage. Herein, sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (Na2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot 2H(2)O) cathode was applied in rechargeable APBs, which demonstrates desirable electrochemical properties and structural stability. At room temperature, NaMnHCF delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 96.3 mAh g(-1) at the current rate of 10 degrees C with negligible redox polarization, and Coulomb efficiency can reach 97.1%. More prominently, minor capacity attenuation appears during the current rate increasing from 10 to 120 degrees C, and it still maintains ultra-long cycle life at these rates, indicating the outstanding ultra-high rate performance. For example, capacity retention can attain 43.3% and 40.0% after 20,000 cycles at the current rate of 60 and 85 degrees C, respectively. Besides, in-situ pH test verifies the successful protons insertion/extraction process in NaMnHCF, and ex-situ XPS, FTIR, and XRD tests reveal the reversible insertion/extraction process of proton and the stable structure of NaMnHCF. These satisfied electrochemical properties are ascribed for the Grotthuss mechanism of proton inside NaMnHCF structure, which could provide a meaningful reference for the cathode exploration of rechargeable APBs.

TI Unidirectional Current in Layered Metal Hexacyanometallate Thin Films:
   Implication for Alternative Wet-Processed Electronic Materials
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Rectifying behavior of alternative electronic materials is demonstrated with layered structures of a crystalline coordination network whose mixed ionic and electronic conductivity can be manipulated by switching the redox state of coordinated transition-metal ions. The coordinated transition-metal ions can convey additional functionality such as (redox)-catalysis or electrochromism. In order to obtain rectifying behavior and charge trapping, layered films of such materials are explored. Specifically, layered films of iron hexacyanoruthenate (Fe-HCR) and nickel hexacyanoferrate (Ni-HCF) were formed by the combination of different deposition procedures. They comprise electrodeposition during voltammetric cycles for Fe-HCR and Ni-HCF, layer-by-layer deposition of Ni-HCF without redox chemistry, and drop casting of presynthesized Ni-HCF nanoparticles. The obtained materials were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy for nanoparticles, and scanning force microscopy (SFM). Voltammetry in 1 mol L-1 KCl and current-voltage curves (I-V curves) recorded between a conductive SFM tip and the back electrode outside of an electrolyte solution demonstrated charge trapping and rectifying behavior based on the different formal potentials of the redox centers in the films.

TI Switchable NaCl cages via a MWCNTs/Ni[Fe(CN)6]2
   nanocomposite for high performance desalination
SO NANOSCALE
AB With the application of nanomaterials in seawater desalination technology increasing, the adjustable characteristics of carbon-based nanomaterials make it possible to use multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) materials in seawater desalination technology. In this study, Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](2) is loaded onto the inner wall of MWCNTs by the co-precipitation method to prepare MWCNTs with variable pore size, making it a switchable cage for NaCl. During the procedure, most of the Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](2) is transferred to the outer surface of the MWCNTs after adsorption, and NaCl is stored inside the MWCNTs (which have been proved by characterization); at the same time, Ni can improve the cell stability of Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](2). The effect of adsorbent reaction time and addition amount on the desalination performance of MWCNTs/Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](2) has been tested. According to the results, the best desalination performance of MWCNTs/Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](2) is 1354.6 mg g(-1) when the reaction time is 0.5 h and the addition amount is 20 mg. After 3 cycles of adsorption and desorption, its desalting performance decreased to 242.3 mg g(-1).

TI Enhancement of the Catalytic Activity of Double Metal Cyanides for the
   Oxidation of Styrene by the Presence of Included Alcohols
SO LANGMUIR
AB In recent years, people have focused on the development of simple and efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the styrene epoxidation reaction. In this work, a FeCo double metal cyanide (DMC) was modified with C1 to C6 linear alcohols, and the prepared materials were used to catalyze the reaction of styrene epoxidation in various solvents. It is noteworthy that the styrene conversion is mainly affected by modification with alcohols, while the selectivity in styrene oxide (SO) is obviously influenced by the solvent. FeCo DMC along with MeOH exhibits the best catalytic performance, with a conversion rate of 96% and a SO selectivity of 86%, in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent. Various physical and chemical methods were used to analyze the structures and compositions of the materials. To clarify the mechanism of the improvement, we set up an original approach to investigate the kinetics of the adsorption process between the oxidant and the catalyst, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The obtained results illustrate that the adsorption process of the oxidant on the surface of FeCo DMC can be dramatically promoted by the presence of MeOH. Such a difference in adsorption thus explains the significant improvement of its catalytic activity by modification with MeOH. This study thus provides a new fundamental understanding of DMC catalysts for the styrene epoxidation reaction.

TI A Three-Component Donor-Acceptor Hybrid Framework with Low-Power
   X-ray-Induced Photochromism
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Donor-acceptor (D-A) hybrid frameworks with visual X-ray photochromism at room temperature are fascinating because of their promising applications as X-ray detectors. Herein, a 3-fold interpenetrated D-A hybrid framework, [Eu(bcbp)(1.5)(DMF)(H2O)(2)][Co(CN)(6)]middot4H(2)OmiddotCH(3)OH (1), has been obtained by incorporating electron-rich Co(CN)(6)(3-) into the electron-deficient europium viologen framework, which interestingly exhibits ultraviolet and low-power X-ray dual photochromism with a remarkable color change from brown to green. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the X-ray photochromic behavior of hybrid 1 could be attributed to its D-A hybrid structural feature increasing the extent of photoinduced electron transfer and thus photogenerated radical species upon X-ray irradiation. Meanwhile, due to the introduction of emissive lanthanide cations in the D-A system, hybrid 1 exhibits photomodulated luminescence properties.

TI Cathode material for sodium-ion batteries based on manganese
   hexacyanoferrate: the role of the binder component
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnHCF) was synthesized by a hydrothermal method and investigated as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. The morphology and the structure of NaMnHCF were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and EDX analysis. New composition of NaMnHCF cathode material for sodium-ion batteries with eco-friendly water-based binder consisting of conducting polymer poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene/polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) dispersion and carboxymethyl cellulose (C\MC) was proposed. The electrochemical properties of NaMnHCF cathode material with conductive polymer binder were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge, and the results were compared with the performance of a conventional PVDF-bound material. It was shown that the initial discharge capacity of electrodes with conductive binder is 130 mAh g(-1), whereas the initial discharge capacity of PVDF-bound electrodes was 109 mAh g(-1)(both at current density 120 mA g(-1), values normalized by NaMnHCF mass). The material with conductive binder also has better rate capability; however, it is losing in cycling capability to the electrode composition with conventional PVDF binder.

TI Revisiting the capacity-fading mechanism of P2-type sodium layered oxide
   cathode materials during high-voltage cycling
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB P2-type sodium layered oxide cathode (Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, P2-NNMO) has attracted great attention as a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries because of its high specific capacity. However, this material suffers from a rapid capacity fade during high-voltage cycling. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the capacity fade, including intragranular fracture caused by the P2-O2 phase transion, surface structural change, and irreversible lattice oxygen release. Here we systematically investigated the morphological, structural, and chemical changes of P2-NNMO during high-voltage cycling using a variety of characterization techniques. It was found that the lattice distortion and crystal-plane buckling induced by the P2-O2 phase transition slowed down the Na-ion transport in the bulk and hindered the extraction of the Na ions. The sluggish kinetics was the main reason in reducing the accessible capacity while other interfacial degradation mechanisms played minor roles. Our results not only enabled a more complete understanding of the capacity-fading mechanism of P2-NNMO but also revealed the underlying correlations between lattice doping and the moderately improved cycle performance.

TI New Zn-NiHCF Hybrid Electrochemically Formed on Glassy Carbon:
   Observation of Thin Layer Diffusion during Electro-Oxidation of
   Hydrazine
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Electrochemical modification of electrodes with thin films of metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCF) enhances the interfacial properties such as electrocatalysis, electrochromism, and ion transport properties. Attempts to prepare hybrids of metal hexacyanoferrates along with Au nanoparticles or by substituting the structure of MHCF with another metal ion were reported from various research groups including us. In this work, we report modification of glassy carbon with a new single phase hybrid Zn-NiHCF (hexacyanoferrate prepared in the presence of Zn2+ and Ni2+) electrochemically for the first time. The hybrid film was characterized by a single well reversible redox process centered at 450 mV. The effect of the zinc and nickel ions in the deposition bath on the effectiveness of modification was studied in detail. The modified hybrid films were characterized by voltammetry, chronoamperometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, etc. The modified films were used for the electro-oxidation of hydrazine. The deviation from the expected behavior of the hybrid porous films provides evidence for the thin layer mass transport prevailing in the film. Thin layer diffusion behavior in MHCF films for the electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine is reported for the first time. The electro-oxidation of hydrazine appears to take place on the glassy carbon (GC) surface. The need for caution in analyzing the electrocatalytic properties of MHCF interfaces is reiterated.

TI Enhancing Na-storage property of
   Na3V2(PO4)3 via porous
   structure Design:From the perspective of carbon source optimization
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The inborn low electronic conductivity of NASCION-type Na3V2(PO4)(3) (NVP) restricts its widespread commercial applications. Traditionally carboreduction method could add a thin carbon-layer on the surface of the particles and enhance its conductivity to some extent, while the underlying mechanism about the reducing agent categories is blurred. In this paper, the mechanism of various frequently-selected carbon sources in the carbothermal process has been explored in detail, and the Na-storage property of NVP has been optimized focusing on the categories of the carbon sources. Owning to the acid etching effect of citric acid, carbon-coated NVP (NVP@C) particles synthesized via adopting citric acid as carbon source display tiny particle size as well as porous Nastorage structure. The construction of porous Na-storing structure, coupled with evenly carbon-coating, upgrades the dynamics of ion and electron transportation effectively, enhancing its Na-storing performances. The optimal experiments indicates that NVP@C prepared with citric acid with the overdose coefficient of 125 % (CR125%-NVP) exhibits the optimal electrochemical performances. In detail, CR125%-NVP showcased the initial discharging specific capacities of 116.2 and 101.3 mAh g(- 1) at 0.1C and 10 C, respectively. It also performed perfect cycle stability, with a capacity retention of 88.9 % after 500 cycles at 10 C rate.

TI Photo-assisted acid-base machine: Battery ensemble to perform work from
   neutralization reactions
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB This study proposes a power source that operates between acidic and basic reservoirs under sunlight to treat acidic wastewater sustainably. We present a strategy that harvests energy from an ionic gradient associated with acidic solution neutralization and water photo-oxidation under UV light. In contrast to neutralization batteries, these photo-assisted acid-base machines operate with an interconnected battery ensemble comprising (A) a photo-assisted acid battery composed of photo-anode (TiO2) for water photo-oxidation and a selective selfassembled cathode consisting of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and phosphomolybdic acid for proton insertion; (B) a proton-alkali ion battery composed of the self-assembled electrode for proton deinsertion and a cathode made of copper hexacyanoferrate for potassium ion electro-insertion, which can be used as portable or stationary power source; (C) an alkali ion-air battery composed of the polycyanometalate for potassium ion deinsertion and a platinum cathode for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This ensemble avoids reverse water splitting reactions and dismisses the need for external electrical power sources, which increases machine efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that acidic solution neutralization from pH = 1.3 to pH = 6.0 can harvest 102.6 kJ per mol of electro-inserted proton: this process converts energy from sunlight and from ionic gradient into electrical work. Therefore, the strategy presented here may contribute to environmental preservation and sustainable growth.

TI Carbon nanostructures in enhancing ranitidine drug degradation by zinc
   hexacyanoferrate
SO SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) and their respective composites, zinc hexacyanoferrate/graphene oxide (ZnHCF/GO) and zinc hexacyanoferrate/carbon nanotubes (ZnHCF/CNT) aiming the application of these materials as photocatalysts in the degradation of ranitidine. The results showed that all samples have the same rhombohedral crystal structure indexed to the Zn-3(II)[Fe-III(CN)(6)](2) formula, containing ZnHCF microparticles of similar to 2.0 mu m, which decrease in size in the presence of carbon nanomaterials. The pH value and mass of the catalysts during the degradation of the ranitidine were evaluated using a triplicate central point factorial design 22. The best experimental condition obtained for pure ZnHCF led to a degradation of 73% of ranitidine, applying 5.0 mg and pH= 6.0. However, for ZnHCF/GO and ZnHCF/CNT nanocomposites results superior than 90% of degradation for the drug was achivied. The excellent degradation results may originate from the high surface area presented by ZnHCF (896 m(2) g(-1)) and the respective ZnHCF/GO (692 m(2) g(-1)) and ZnHCF/CNT (473 m(2) g(-1)) nanocomposites, high adsorption capacity of the carbon materials and also to an increase of the electronic transfer rate, with consequent enhancing of the redox process and higher efficiency in the electron/hole pair separation.

TI Photoluminescent Lanthanide(III) Single-Molecule Magnets in
   Three-Dimensional Polycyanidocuprate(I)-Based Frameworks
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Three-dimensional bimetallic cyanido-bridged frameworks, [Ln(III)(2,2 '-bipyridine N,N '-dioxide)(2)(H2O)][Cu-2(I)(CN)(5)]center dot 5 H2O (Ln=Dy, 1; Yb, 2), are reported. They exhibit the effect of slow relaxation of magnetization, leading to a magnetic hysteresis loop, and sensitized visible-to-near-infrared photoluminescence. Both physical properties are related to the eight-coordinated lanthanide(III) complexes embedded in the unprecedented coordination skeleton composed of symmetry-breaking polycyanidocuprate linkers. The three-dimensional d-f cyanido-bridged network was shown to serve as an efficient coordination scaffold to achieve emissive lanthanide single-molecule magnets.

TI Energy harvesting from neutralization reactions with saline feedback
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB This work proposes an acid-base machine consisting of insertion electrodes for protons and alkaline metal ions placed in electrolytic solutions with different pH values and alkaline ion concentrations to harvest energy from a neutralization reaction. We simulate energy harvesting during acidic wastewater treatment with base (KOH) by using phosphomolybdic acid and nickel hexacyanoferrate as the negative and the positive electrodes, respectively, in aqueous H2SO4 and K2SO4 solutions. In this configuration, the machine harvests energy from a change in the free energy related to changes in the proton and in the potassium ion concentrations after neutralization reactions, with feedback from the saline solution resulting from neutralization. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy diagrams provide insight into the practical proton and potassium ion electroinsertion reversibility in acidic and neutral media. Based on the charge/discharge curves at pH = 2 and pH = 5.8, the acid-base machine harvests ca. 10 kJ per mol of electro-inserted protons in the first cycles. These results demonstrate that the methodology is viable for sustainable growth-it can harvest energy from wastewater treatment, a practice that can be especially profitable for the industrial sector, which produces great amounts of wastewater.

TI η-Carbides (Co, Mo, or W) Nanoparticles from Octacyanometalates
   Precursors-Based Network
SO SMALL
AB This paper describes a simple, two-steps chemical pathway to obtain bimetallic carbide nanoparticles (NPs) of general formula MxM.yC, also called..-carbides. This process allows for a control of the chemical composition of metals present in the carbides (M = Co and M. = Mo or W). The first step involves the synthesis of a precursor consisting of a network of octacyanometalates. The second step consists in a thermal degradation of the previously obtained octacyanometalates networks under neutral atmosphere (Ar or N-2). It is shown that this process results in the formation of carbide NPs with diameter of approximate to 5nm, and the stoichiometries Co3M'C-3, Co6M'C-6, Co2M'C-4 for the Cs-Co-M' systems.

TI Hybrid nanostructure of sanwhich-like porous Co3O4
   nanorods/exfoliate graphite composite for lithium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB High rate capacity and long cycling life are the main properties that expand the application of Co3O4 as anode materials, which are largely dependent on their structure and conductivity. In this work, we provide a facial method to achieve sanwhich-like exfoliate graphite-Co3O4 porous nanorods (EG/Co3O4) by two-step method hydrothermal and carbonization using EG as the conductivity matrix. The SEM and TEM analyses showed that EG successfully embed into the inner part of the Co3O4 nanorods. The addition of EG not only enhances the conductivity of the Co-based materials but also alleviates the aggregation of nanoparticles, while providing a large contact area for the electrode-electrolyte interface. This leads to an excellent rate capacity of 508 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1). Moreover, the Co3O4 nanorods consist of interconnected nanoparticles, which help reduce the distance that lithium ions need to diffuse and facilitate electron transport. This capability effectively addresses the severe volumetric variation and contributes to optimal cycling performance, resulting in a high charge capacity of 847 mAh g(-1) over 200 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). The outstanding electrochemical performance of EG/Co3O4 makes it a highly favorable option for use in lithium-ion batteries.

TI Studies of Er(III)-W(V) compounds showing nonlinear optical activity and
   single-molecule magnetic properties
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB Self-assembly of Er.III) ions with octacyanidotungstate.V) in the presence of pure N,N-dimethylacetamide (dma) resulted in the formation of one-dimensional zigzag chain {[Er-III(dma)(5)][W-V(CN)(8)]}(n) (1). Coordination polymer 1 crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group P2(1) and it exhibits second harmonic generation (SHG) effect with SH susceptibility of 5.8 x 10(-11) esu. Interestingly, the treatment of 1 with small amount of water results in the generation of another complex salt [Er-III(dma)(5)(H2O2)][W-V(CN)(8)]center dot dma center dot H2O (2) which crystallizes in centrosymmetric space groups of P21/n, disqualifying the occurrence of SHG phenomenon. On the other hand, the elimination of cyanido-bridges and formation of seven-coordinated erbium.III) centre resulted in magnetic field induced single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour with effective energy barrier of 28.6(3) K for 2. Finally, self-assembly of Er.III) with octacyanidotungstate.V) in water/dma mixture gave a complex salt [Er-III(dma)(4)(H2O)(3))]center dot[W-V(CN)(8)]center dot dma center dot H2O (3) similar to 2. Dynamic magnetic studies reveal that 3 is also showing slow magnetic relaxation, however, the substitution of single dma by water molecule induces the change in the local geometry of Er.III) centre leading to weak SMM properties for 3.

TI Iodine-doped carbon fibers as an efficient metal-free catalyst to
   activate peroxymonosulfate for the removal of organic pollutants
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Developing efficient and metal-free catalytic oxidation systems based on PMS activation has become an increasingly important and challenging objective in the environmental catalysis field. In this study, iodine doped carbon fibers (I-CFs), as a low-cost and environmentally-friendly metal-free catalyst, were used for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS), with the innovative construction of a simple and efficient I-CFs/PMS catalytic system. In this system, I-CFs exhibited extra-high catalytic activity to activate PMS for the removal of Acid Red 1 (AR1) over a wide pH range of 3-10, with a remarkably pH-tolerant performance. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technology with various spin-trapping agents, such as ascorbic acid, methyl alcohol and l-histidine, was employed to confirm that singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was the key radical species contributing to AR1 removal in the catalytic oxidation system, which is different from the widely reported radical pathway for PMS. Furthermore, the I-CFs/PMS system showed excellent anti-interference performance for the removal of AR1 when dye auxiliaries, such as NaCl, were added into the system, distinct from previous reports where NaCl can capture radicals and severely inhibit the decomposition of organic pollutants. The findings of this study provide a novel catalytic oxidation system for the activation of PMS, which could be potentially applied to environmental remediation.

TI Transition-Metal Nitroprussides Examined for Water Harvesting and
   Sorption Cooling
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Transition-metal pentacyanonitrosylferrates, commonly known as nitroprussides, have a long and documented history. Here, we synthesize cobalt and nickel nitroprussides (NPs) in order to probe their use as sorbents for water and fluorocarbon uptake for potential water harvesting and cooling applications. These NPs show stable and reversible equilibrium sorption isotherms at room temperature with peak uptake values of similar to 40 wt % for H2O and similar to 30 wt % for fluorocarbon R134a. At water harvesting conditions, working capacities of similar to 19 wt % were obtained for NPs. At sorption cooling conditions, the working capacities favored nickel NP. Given the advantages of an easy, inexpensive, and scalable synthesis, this study demonstrates the potential for using nitroprussides for future water harvesting and adsorption cooling systems.

TI Tuning the thermal stability of copper(II) hexacyanoferrate(II)
   nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB It is well known that the physical properties of nanoparticles can be tuned by controlling synthetic factors such as pH, temperature, reactant ratio or type of stabiliser used. In this work, the reactant ratio is varied to produce batches of copper(II) hexacyanoferrate(II) (Cu-HCF) with different cyano decomposition temperatures. This is accomplished by controlling the number of Fe(CN)64- site vacancies throughout the structure. By reducing the number of vacancies and consequently the need for water to complete the structure, the thermal decomposition temperature of Cu-HCF can be increased. In addition to this, we also note that the guest ion similarly contributes to the decomposition temperature. By exchanging K+ with Cs+, an increased resistance to thermal decomposition is realised. As the incorporation of Cs+ ions into the structure does not alter the number of Fe(CN)64- site vacancies, this enhancement is attributed to a change in the geometry of the copper coordination sphere.

AB K-ion batteries, as an emerging battery system, have attracted tremendous attention in the research community. Herein, we report a K-ion full-cell based on a nano-sized K1.92Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.94)center dot 0.5H(2)O cathode, dipotassium terephthalate (K2TP)@carbon nanotube (CNT) anode and an optimized electrolyte.

The side reactions of K metal with the electrolyte are suppressed in KClO4/propylene carbonate (PC). The K2TP nanosheets grown in situ on the CNT show a high reversible capacity of about 250 mA h g(-1) and an ultra-high rate capability. The full-cells based on them are well cycled in a DME-based electrolyte and show a great promise for large-scale energy storage.

TI N-doping modified zeolitic imidazole Framework-67 (ZIF-67) for enhanced
   peroxymonosulfate activation to remove ciprofloxacin from aqueous
   solution
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, N doped ZIF-67 (N@ZIF-67) was prepared via hydrothermal method and applied for heterogeneous catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in the remediation of pharmaceuticals, exemplified by antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) in aqueous solution. The morphological and physicochemical properties of N@ZIF-67 were characterized and the catalytic activity for degradation of organic contaminants was studied. The N@ZIF-67 significantly enhanced electron transfer between reacting species with excellent catalytic performance in CIP degradation. CIP degradation in the N@ZIF-67/PMS system took place over a broad pH range of 5 to 9. Moreover, the synergistic effect between nitrogen and ZIF-67 structure not only significantly boosted the CIP removal efficiency but also long-term stability of the composite. The dissolution of cobalt ion was below the allowable drinking water standard. The superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)) was not only involved in the generation of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) but also played a crucial role in CIP degradation. This proof-of-concept study for the development of N@ZIF-67 paves the new venue for wastewater remediation through PMS activation.

TI Photomagnetic Carbon Nanotubes at Ambient Conditions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Bis (2,2-bipyridine)-5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)(2)(phen-NH2)(2+)), an MLCT complex, has a long-lived triplet state in water (lambda(ex): 473 nm; lambda(em),: 620 nm; tau = 615 ns; Phi = 1 relative to that of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)) and a structure analogous to Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). When Ru-(bpy)2(phen-NH2)(2+) was subjected to diazotization in the presence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), it formed nanodots on the CNTs, rendering the resulting tubes (Ru@CNT) capable of transducing photo stimuli (473 nm) into electricity and magnetism at ambient conditions. The increased functionality was highly reproducible, as evidenced by conductive-mode AFM, vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and AC susceptibility analysis. The local magnetism probing of the Ru@CNT with magnetic-mode AFM techniques (MFM) indicated that the magnetism originated from the unpaired electrons formed on the photoexcited nanodots. The resulting phase shift behaved as a function of the luminous power and the voltage (V-b) of the electrical bias applied to the Ru@CNT. The V-b dependence deviated from the expected quadratic correlation, confirming that the formation of the photoinduced charge separation state at the nanodots is responsible for the photomagnetism. The Ru@CNT tubes showed mobility toward external magnets (65 G) when floating on water and under 473 nm illumination. The Ru@CNT thus appears to be a multifunctional material that might be useful in spintronics.

TI Revisiting the Spectrum of Co(CN)63-: The Role of Correlation,
   Solvation, and Vibronic and Spin-Orbit Couplings
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB In the present work, we revisit the spectrum of the hexacyanocobaltate(III) ion, [Co(CN)6]3-, which has been considered a prototype complex in the coordination chemistry, with modern quantum chemistry methods. The main features have been describing by revealing the role of different effects, such as vibronic coupling, solvation and spin-orbit coupling. The UV-vis spectrum is composed by two bands (1A1g -> 1T1g and 1A1g -> 1T2g), characterized by singlet-singlet metal-centered transitions, and a more intense third one, characterized by charge transfer transition. There is also a small band shoulder. The first two are symmetry-forbidden transitions in the Oh group. Their intensity can only be explained by a vibronic coupling mechanism. For the band shoulder, additional to vibronic coupling, spin-orbit coupling is also necessary, since the transition is characterized as singlet to triplet, 1A1g -> 3T1g.

TI Enantioselective separation under humid conditions by chiral Hofmann
   clathrates: new opportunities for vintage materials
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Chiral separation is of critical importance in many areas spanning from pharmaceutics and agriculture to catalysis. Coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks have been envisaged for such a purpose. In this study, the post-synthetic functionalization of the two-dimensional Hofmann clathrate [Ni(H2O)(2)][Ni(CN)(4)] with enantiopure phenylethylamines yielding hydrostable chiral clathrates is reported. In the case of (R) and (S) butan-2-ol, we demonstrate that the obtained coordination frameworks exhibit clear enantioselective properties, which can be used for the separation of enantiomers under humid conditions.

TI Advanced Anode Materials for Aqueous Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS
AB Aqueous electrolytes are praised for their inherent safety, cost-effectiveness, and minimal environmental impact, making aqueous potassium-ion batteries (APIBs) a viable alternative for sustainable and eco-friendly energy solutions. Researchers have endeavored to anode materials that align with the unique requirements of aqueous electrolytes, and some proud achievements are made. The research about APIBs anode has focused on organic materials and polyanionic compounds, both exhibiting desirable hydrated potassium storage performance, and in recent years, on the development of metal compounds and alloy-based materials with high theoretical capacities. However, the anode of APIBs faces a narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) caused by aqueous electrolytes and volume expansion problems due to the large radius of potassium ions, which prevents them from exhibiting appreciable capacity with satisfactory cycling stability. This review meticulously delineates the latest advancements and representative materials for the anode of APIBs and introduces several common aqueous electrolytes and effective improvement strategies for them. The focus is on the advantages and bottlenecks faced by different types of anode materials, culminating in a proposed methodology to enhance APIBs anode efficacy. This review endeavors to furnish novel perspectives on the development and pragmatic deployment of APIBs anodes.

TI Effect of Electrolyte Anion on Electrochemical Behavior of Nickel
   Hexacyanoferrate Electrode in Aqueous Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF METALS AND MATERIALS
AB Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) has a three-dimensional open framework structure, excellent long-cycling stability and rate performance as a cathode for aqueous sodium-ion batteries. However, the specific capacity of NiHCF is lower than that of present cathodes for aqueous batteries. A sodium-ion electrolyte was explored to achieve optimum capacity with NiHCF. Powder-type NiHCF was fabricated by coprecipitation with the atomic composition K0.065Ni1.44Fe(CN)(6)center dot 4.4H(2)O. The presence of Fe vacancies in the atomic composition is attributable to the inclusion of coordinating and zeolitic water during coprecipitation. Two sodium-ion electrolytes, 1 M Na2SO4 and 1 M NaNO3, were employed to analyze the electrochemical behavior of the NiHCF electrode. Identical redox potentials to 0.58 V (vs. NHE) were measured in both electrolytes. However, a lower overpotential was observed in NaNO3 compared to Na2SO4 as a result of the smaller interfacial charge transfer resistance. The lower charge transfer resistance in the NaNO3 solution produced a higher specific capacity of 57 mAh g(-1) (1 C-rate) and the superior capacity retention of 46.6% at 20 C-rate. The anion in the aqueous electrolyte changed the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface, confirming the electrolyte anion has a crucial effect on the charge capacity and rate performance of NiHCF.

TI MoS2/FeS Nanocomposite Catalyst for Efficient Fenton Reaction
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Nanocomposites containing FeS as catalyst and MoS2 as cocatalyst have been synthesized toward efficient heterogeneous Fenton reaction. The deposition of FeS nano-particles in situ on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets creates strong contact between the two components and generates a large number of exposed Mo6+ sites and sulfur vacancies, which contribute to the enhanced degradation rate by accelerating Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling and ensuring rapid electron transfer. In addition, the MoS2/FeS nanocomposite catalysts exhibit the best performance at near-neutral conditions (pH 6.5), which solves the challenges in conventional Fenton reactions such as leaching of metal ions, the formation of iron slurry, and the need of adjusting solution pH. Further, the nanocomposite can maintain high efficiency after many recycling experiments. It is believed that the MoS2/ FeS nanocomposite represents an efficient heterogeneous Fenton catalyst that can greatly promote the performance of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for solving practical environmental issues.

TI Recent advances of in-situ spectroscopic analysis for cathode materials
   of sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB The development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) suffers from some challenges, including poor cycling stability and irreversible phase transitions, especially for cathodes. Currently, the key to designing high-performance cathode is to explore and reveal the structural evolution regular of electrode materials during de/sodiation process through advanced in-situ spectroscopic analysis, which not only helps to in-depth evaluate underlying reaction mechanism, but also favors the comprehensive understanding of the improvement strategies. Therefore, this review first introduces the working principle of the most commonly used in-situ spectroscopic analysis, including X-ray powder diffractometer, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure. And then highlights their latest application progress starting from the correlation between structural evolution and electrochemical performance of the representative cathode materials. This article aims to elucidate the potential reaction mechanisms and structural evolution behind different types of classic cathode materials for SIBs, providing guidance for the design of advanced cathode materials. Finally, the challenges encountered by the further development of in-situ spectroscopic analysis are discussed, and the corresponding outlook is provided. This work aims to emphasize the key role of in-situ spectroscopic analysis for elucidating reaction mechanisms behind improved electrochemical performance, and hence is expected to provide a guidance for designing advanced cathode materials.

TI Structure and abnormal thermal expansion in
   Cu2-xMgxP2O7
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Due to the distinctive negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior, Cu2P2O7 has garnered significant interest. Chemical substitution emerges as a potent approach to modulate thermal expansion. By the solid-state reaction method, a series of Cu2-xMgxP2O7 (0 <= x <= 2) compounds have been prepared, and the thermal expansion of Cu2-xMgxP2O7 is gradually transformed from strong negative to near zero (from -12.5 x 10(-6) K-1 to -0.36 x 10(-6) K-1), to positive as the concentration of Mg2+ increases. Cu2-xMgxP2O7 (0 <= x <= 2) undergoes phase transitions from alpha-Cu2P2O7 to beta-Cu2P2O7 to beta-Mg2P2O7 and finally to alpha-Mg2P2O7. The first-principles calculation shows that the weakening of the NTE properties of Cu2-xMgxP2O7 is due to the substitution of Mg2+ reducing the flexibility of the structure. This work has realized the tailoring thermal expansion and has significantly improved the understanding of the complex link between the structural properties and the behavior of NTE materials.

TI MnFe@CeOx Core-Shell Nanocages for the Selective
   Catalytic Reduction of NO with NH3 at Low Temperature
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB To enable the catalytic performance and water (H2O) resistance of manganese-based catalysts to be further improved, a series of MnFe@CeOx core-shell nanocages were synthesized. By adjustment of the thickness of the CeO2 shell layer, it was found that the MnFe@CeOx-60 catalyst with a shell layer thickness of 60 nm could exhibit more than 80% NO removal efficiency at 120-250 degrees C. In addition, it could exhibit better H2O resistance at 160 degrees C. A series of characterizations proved that the MnFe@CeOx-60 catalyst had abundant oxygen vacancy defect sites and surface acid sites. In addition, the MnFe@CeOx-60 catalyst had more Mn4+, Fe3+, Ce3+, and surface-adsorbed oxygen (O-ads) species, as well as strong interactions between MnOx, FeOx, and CeOx, so that the catalyst had better catalytic activity. This indicated that the unique interface diffusion effect produced by construction of the CeO2 shell could remarkably enhance the catalytic performance and H2O resistance. Simultaneously, the in situ diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform analysis showed that the MnFe@CeOx-60 catalyst mainly followed the L-H reaction mechanism during the NH3 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reaction. Finally, building a shell layer could skillfully utilize the diffusion between different species to realize strong interaction among active species, which was of great significance and universality.

TI Construction of Fe-doped CoP with hybrid nanostructures as a
   bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Due to their open skeleton structures, adjustable active sites and homogeneous catalytic centers, PBA-based materials have promising applications in electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we report a PBA derived Fe-0.25-CoP electrocatalyst with a hybrid nanostructure, which offered a large specific surface area and active sites for the HER and OER, respectively. The as-synthesized Fe-0.25-CoP catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance and durability at overpotentials of 262 mV for the OER and 111 mV for the HER, requiring a voltage of merely 1.57 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the electrocatalytic water splitting process. The preeminent activity of Fe-0.25-CoP was mainly ascribed to the framework structures of Co-PBA and appropriate doping of Fe3+ which regulated the electronic structures and morphology of Fe-0.25-CoP. In addition, the partial phosphating strategy retained the active centers for the OER in Co-PBA, which were further enhanced by the catalysis of Fe3+. In short, the rational design and regulation of catalyst structures and compositions is a promising approach for the development of highly efficient water splitting catalysts.

TI Direct implementation of K3Fe(CN)6 as cathode
   materials of sodium-ion batteries
SO MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY
AB Transition metal cyanides are considered as a promising cathode candidate of sodium-ion batteries. Herein, we reported a direct implementation of commercial K3Fe(CN)(6) (KFC) as active cathode material of SIBs by a simple recrystallization method. Our results suggest that by integrating conductive carbons (SuperP, abbreviated as SP) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with KFC, an efficient conducting network could be well established for the utilization of KFC active components, thereby endows excellent cyclic and rate performances. Specifically, the KFC/SP/CNTs composite delivers its theoretical capacity of 81 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, and a reversible capacity of 75.6 mAh g(-1) at 1C which maintains 62.6 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles. At ultrahigh rate of 12C, the capacity retention can reach 68% of initial. Our effort suggests that direct implementing industrial KFC as cathode materials for SIBs is highly feasible, which may provide a low-cost cathode candidate of sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage.

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The aggravation of energy and environmental issues forces people to develop sustainable energy storage technologies. In recent years, emerging ammonium-ion storage has been considered a promising energy storage competitor because of NH4+ ions as charge carriers with merits of abundant resources, inherent safety, fast diffusion capability and unique storage mechanism. However, the development of NH4-ion storage devices is still in the initial stage, and finding appropriate electrode materials is one of the most important tasks for fabricating high-performance devices. This article provides a comprehensive review on recent advances of electrode materials for emerging NH4-ion storage devices. Firstly, the ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs) are briefly summarized, and then the cathode materials, anode materials and their NH4-ion storage mechanism based on hydrogen bond are introduced. Furthermore, other NH4-ion storage devices, including NH4-ion supercapacitors (NH4+-SCs), NH4ion capacitors (AICs), ammonium dual-ion batteries (ADIBs) and ammonium-zinc hybrid batteries (AHBs), are also briefly introduced. Finally, a short conclusion and our perspectives on future developments for NH4-ion storage device's electrodes are provided in order to promote their large-scale energy storage applications.

TI Confined ultrasmall MOF nanoparticles anchored on a 3D-graphene network
   as efficient and broad pH-adaptive photo Fenton-like catalysts
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for persulfate-based Fenton-like processes have attracted tremendous attention nowadays. However, the low utilization of active sites and poor stability of MOFs still impede their practical application. In this work, we demonstrate a unique photo Fenton-like catalyst with confined ultrasmall MOF nanoparticles anchored on a 3D-graphene network, which is fabricated through a simple confined thermal pulverization method. The ultrasmall Co-Fe MOF nanoparticles with confined structure endowed this catalyst with highly exposed active sites as well as excellent stability. It can maintain high degradation efficiency via visible light-assisted peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in a broad pH range from 1-13. Electron spin resonance (ESR) technology reveals that both radical and nonradical processes are involved in this process, and the broad pH adaptability of this system is due to the stable generation of OH, SO4-, O-2(-), and O-1(2) under these pH conditions. This study provides new perspectives for the development of highly efficient and harsh environment-adaptive MOF-based Fenton-like catalysts.

TI On the Beneficial Effect of MgCl2 as Electrolyte Additive to
   Improve the Electrochemical Performance of
   Li4Ti5O12 as Cathode in Mg Batteries
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Magnesium batteries are a promising technology for a new generation of energy storage for portable devices. Attention should be paid to electrolyte and electrode material development in order to develop rechargeable Mg batteries. In this study, we report the use of the spinel lithium titanate or Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) as an active electrode for Mg2+-ion batteries. The theoretical capacity of LTO is 175 mA h g(-1), which is equivalent to an insertion reaction with 1.5 Mg2+ ions. The ability to enhance the specific capacity of LTO is of practical importance. We have observed that it is possible to increase the capacity up to 290 mA h g(-1) in first discharge, which corresponds to the reaction with 2.5 Mg2+ ions. The addition of MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O to the electrolyte solutions significantly improves their electrochemical performance and enables reversible Mg deposition. Ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal little structural changes, while X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (XPS) measurements suggest Mg reacts with LTO. The Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio increases with the amount of inserted magnesium. The impedance spectra show the presence of a semicircle at medium-low frequencies, ascribable to Mg2+ ion diffusion between the surface film and LTO. Further experimental improvements with exhaustive control of electrodes and electrolytes are necessary to develop the Mg battery with practical application.

TI Controlled Element Specific Nanoscale Domains by Self-Assembly for High
   Performance Bifunctional Alkaline Water Splitting Catalyst
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB A stable bifunctional water-splitting catalyst can simplify the development of alkaline medium electrolyzers. In this study, a catalytic material with controlled nanoscale domains of Pt and Ni is formed by a self-assembly process at room temperature. The final structure of the catalyst is achieved through two-stage transformation, first is the formation of Pt-Ni nanoscale domains and then inducing Ni to higher oxidation states. The material has a nanowire-like morphology at the macroscale, which ensures rapid kinetics and mass transfer. The results prove that the nanoscale domains of Pt, Ni, and Ni2+ and Ni3+ with close interfacing are crucial for the performance of the electrocatalyst and ensure the presence of Ni in a high oxidation state, leading to both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The catalyst has a low overpotential and ultralow Tafel slope for both HER and OER, 13.7 and 32 mV dec(-1), respectively, crucial for high power applications.

TI Crystal water-capturing and film-forming bifunctional electrolyte
   additive for stabilizing sodium iron hexacyanoferrate cathode for Na-ion
   batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Due to its affordability, strong structural stability, and high rate capability, rhombohedral sodium ferrous hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) has been identified as a potential cathode material for sodium ion batteries. Nevertheless, the presence of inherent crystal water and the susceptibility of its interface stability significantly hinder its capacity and cycling performance. In this study, we propose a novel modification approach involving the addition of ZnCl2 2 to effectively capture crystal water and facilitate the in-situ formation of a ZnO coating on the FeHCF surface. Due to the decreased crystal water content and the presence of stable ZnO interphases, the occurrence of side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, as well as crystal particle cracks in FeHCF during repeated sodiation/desodiation processes, is effectively reduced. Consequently, the modified FeHCF demonstrates an extended operational lifespan of 1000 cycles, with an initial discharge capacity of 112.0 mAh/g and a capacity retention rate of 77.8 % at a current rate of 1C within the voltage range of 2.0-4.2 V. Our research offers valuable insights into the removal of crystal water and the engineering of incident interfaces to enhance the cycle life of FeHCF cathodes in sodium-ion batteries.

TI Systematic effect of different external metals of hexacyanoferrates on
   cesium adsorption behavior and mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY
AB This study aims to investigate Cs removal by different external metals hexacyanoferrates M-II- Fe PBA (M-II: Co, Ni and Cu). Three PBAs were synthesized, characterized and followed by batch experiment testing and model fitting. Among the three PBAs, Cu-Fe PBA possessed the highest capacity 234.28 mg g(-1), the highest K-d 2.8 x106 mL g(-1) and the fastest adsorption kinetics on Cs removal. Moreover, Cu-Fe PBA and Ni-Fe PBA were the more selective sorbents in coexisting ions study. Finally, the adsorption mechanism was proposed. This study provides new insights into the vacancies effect of the PBA structure and Cs adsorption application.

TI Hydrothermal synthesis as a versatile tool for the preparation of metal
   hexacyanoferrates: a review
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCF), which are produced by hydrothermal synthesis, have received increasing attention for different applications due to their unique physicochemical properties, such as three-dimensional framework with large open sites and metal sites with different oxidation states. The hydrothermal method is a simple and established synthesis technique, with the ability to synthesize unstable materials near the melting point, the possibility to synthesize large and good quality crystals and to obtain tunable size particles, controlled agglomeration, and low contamination by impurities, and in which the properties of products depend on the formation mechanism and hydrothermal conditions. Focusing on the structure of HCF including crystallography and morphology from the literature, this review discusses the effects of synthesis conditions (metal precursor, hydrothermal temperature, and duration) and post-treatment (acid addition and calcination) on the formation of metal hexacyanoferrates. Furthermore, structural modifications and current progress toward the application of HCF as catalysts, sensors, adsorbents, electrochromic displays, and energy storage are also summarized in this review.

TI Carbon microsphere-templated synthesis of ZnCo2O4
   hollow spheres functionalized with Ag nanoparticles for sub-ppm-level
   acetone gas detection
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB This paper demonstrated a high-performance acetone sensor based on sensing material of ZnCo2O4@Ag hollow spheres (HSs) was prepared using carbon microsphere as sacrifice template. The ZnCo2O4@Ag HSs film was coated on a ceramic tube with two Au electrodes, and the nanostructure of ZnCo2O4@Ag HSs was examined by XRD, EDS, SEM, TEM and XPS techniques. The gas sensing investigation was performed under different working temperatures (120-320 degrees C) for the ZnCo2O4@Ag sensors with different Ag loading amount. The results show that the ZnCo2O4@Ag (2 wt%) based sensor yields excellent acetone-sensing performance at 220 degrees C, such as low detection limit (0.25 ppm), fast response/recovery properties (4 s/20 s@0.25 ppm), and good selectivity. The excellent acetone-sensing performance benefits from the p-type semiconductor properties of ZnCo2O4 and the catalysis of Ag nanoparticles. This work confirmed that the ZnCo2O4@Ag (2 wt%) based sensor has promising applications for highly sensitive and selective acetone detection in various fields.

TI Sequential Structural Control of Open-Framework Nanoparticles Both in
   Dispersion and in Film for Electrochemical Performance Tuning
SO BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB We demonstrated that the sequential structural control of nanoparticles of an open-framework coordination polymer, copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF). The structural control has been achieved by adding the component ions not only in dispersion phase but also in the thin film form. The CuHCF nanoparticles (NPs) in the dispersion phase changed chemical composition and enhanced dispersibility with capturing [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) anions. On the other hand, the NPs in the thin film were reversibly turned to the original state by capturing Cu2+ cations. Through the sequential processes, all of the synthesized CuHCF NPs were utilized for the high-quality electrochemical electrode for without electrochemical side reaction. This process will contribute the preparation of various electrochemical devices such as electrochromic devices, secondary batteries and biosensors.

TI Charge Redistribution Effects in Hexacyanometallates Evaluated from XPS
   Data
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The charge redistribution effects determine the physical and functional properties of transition metal hexacyanometallates. The pi-back bonding interaction between the CN ligand and the metal (M) linked at its C end and the sigma donation from the N end to a second transition metal (T), when a coordination polymer is formed, are relevant features of such effects. The pi-back donation interaction contributes to the overlapping of the electron clouds of M and T metals in the center dot center dot center dot-T-N equivalent to C-M-C equivalent to N-T-center dot center dot center dot chain. In this contribution, we demonstrate that XPS spectroscopy is a useful tool to sense the change in the electron density redistribution in hexacyanometallates related to these two mechanisms. The results herein discussed contribute to understand the physical and chemical properties of these materials. Initially, a series of potassium salts, K-n[M6-n(CN)(6)] (M = Cr-III, Fe-II, Ru-II, Os-II, Co-III, Rh-III, Ir-III, Pt-IV) is considered in order to evaluate the role of the pi-back donation on the electron density found at the N atom, which determines the strength for the T-NC coordination bond and of the mentioned electron clouds overlapping. Then, a representative set of transition metal (T) hexacyanometallates, T2(1-y)K2y[Fe-II(CN)(6)](,) is studied in order to shed light on the electron density redistribution when a coordination bond is formed at the N end. Within such coordination polymers, the copper (2+) salts are particularly attractive by the unique interaction between the copper atom and the hexacyanometallate ion, and the potential applications of these copper (2+) complexes in heterogeneous catalysis and other areas. From these reasons, the recorded XPS spectra for Cu (2+) hexacyanometallates were evaluated in detail. In accordance with a previous study of these copper (2+) coordination polymers using other techniques, XPS data is sensing an atypical strong bonding interaction with the CN ligand. The experimental XPS data herein discussed are relevant for the coordination chemistry of transition metal hexacyanometallates and for the research community involved in their applications.

TI Ultrafine Ir nanoparticles decorated on FeP/FeOOH with abundant
   interfaces via a facile corrosive approach for alkaline
   water-splitting
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB In order to generate clean hydrogen fuel, it is necessary to exploit bifunctional catalysts with high activity and excellent stability for overall water-splitting. Herein, we develop ultrafine Ir nanoparticles coupled with FeP/FeOOH with abundant interfaces on iron foam (FF) via facile corrosive strategies. The ingeniously designed catalyst structure not only exposes abundant active centers, but also enhances the electron transport efficiently. Thus, the FF-NaCl-Ir-P catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activities for the OER (169 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and HER (69 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH, which was better than most of the previously reported catalysts. For water-splitting, it only needs 1.47 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and its performance hardly deteriorates after 50 hours test at a large-current density of 1000 mA cm(-2). The overall water-splitting can also be motivated by simple sustainable energy, such as solar, wind and thermal energies.

TI The High Performance of Crystal Water Containing Manganese Birnessite
   Cathodes for Magnesium Batteries
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Rechargeable magnesium batteries have lately received great attention for large-scale energy storage systems due to their high volumetric capacities, low materials cost, and safe characteristic. However, the bivalency of Mg2+ ions has made it challenging to find cathode materials operating at high voltages with decent (de)intercalation kinetics. In an effort to overcome this challenge, we adopt an unconventional approach of engaging crystal water in the layered structure of Birnessite MnO2 because the crystal water can effectively screen electrostatic interactions between Mg2+ ions and the host anions. The crucial role of the crystal water was revealed by directly visualizing its presence and dynamic rearrangement using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Moreover, the importance of lowering desolvation energy penalty at the cathodeelectrolyte interface was elucidated by working with water containing nonaqueous electrolytes. In aqueous electrolytes, the decreased interfacial energy penalty by hydration of Mg2+ allows Birnessite MnO2 to achieve a large reversible capacity (231.1 mAh g(-1)) at high operating voltage (2.8 V vs Mg/Mg2+) with excellent cycle life (62.5% retention after 10000 cycles), unveiling the importance of effective charge shielding in the host and facile Mg2+ ions transfer through the cathodes interface.

TI Redox-Induced Reversible Uptake-Release of Cations in Porous Ionic
   Crystals Based on Polyoxometalate: Cooperative Migration of Electrons
   with Alkali Metal Ions
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Redox-active porous ionic crystals based on polyoxometalates (POM) were synthesized. By treating the crystal with an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid (reducing reagent) and KCI, one-electron reduction of POM proceeded followed by simultaneous uptake of K. Interestingly, the reduction did not proceed without KCl, and the molecular size of ascorbic acid was too large to enter the porous crystal lattice. The time courses of reduction and K+ uptake were monitored by UV vis spectroscopy and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), respectively. Both profiles could be reproduced by the linear driving force (LDF) model with similar rate constants. The reduced crystal could be oxidized with aqueous chlorine solution followed by the release of K+ and the redox cycles were reversible. The water sorption properties of the crystals could be controlled by the types of alkali metal ions incorporated. The Cs+ uptake and the simultaneous reduction of the crystal proceeded much faster than in the case of K+ which is in line with the trends in the Gibbs energies of hydration of alkali metal ions. Complete selectivity to Cs+ was observed in the uptake of ions from an aqueous binary mixture of Cs+ and Na+. All these results suggest the cooperative migration of electrons with alkali metal ions and the redox induced ion-exchange in porous ionic crystals based on POM.

TI Hofmann-MOF-derived CoFeNi nanoalloy@CNT as a magnetic activator for
   peroxymonosulfate to degrade benzophenone-1 in water
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB As the extensively-employed UV stabilizer, 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (benzophenone-1 (BP1)) has been proven an endocrine disruptor, developing of useful technologies for eliminating BP1 is highly desired. Because SO4 center dot--based oxidation technologies are promising for eliminating emerging pollutants, cobalt (Co) is an extremely useful catalyst for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, and it is critical to developing an advantageous cobaltic catalyst for PMS activation. Herein, an exceptional catalyst is developed for the first time from a Hofmann-type MOF ([CoFe]pyrazine[Ni(CN)4]), which is then pyrolyzed to afford CoFeNi alloy nanoparticles (NPs) confined in carbon nanotubes (CNTs), resulting in CoFeNi@CNT (CFNC). This CFNC would exhibit numerous promising features: (1) as Co represents the most efficient metal for activating PMS, CoFeNi alloy would offer superior activities for PMS activation; (2) the strong magnetism of CoFeNi alloy enables CFNC to be magnetically controllable; (3) CoFeNi alloy NPs confined within CNT would be guarded to increase its durability; (4) the interlaced structures of CFNC make it exhibit much more reactive surface areas for activating PMS. Thus, CFNC exhibits a significantly stronger activating capability than Co3O4, which is the benchmark heterogeneous catalyst for PMS. Furthermore, CFNC could also be reusable and remain highly effective, stable, and robust for multiple cycles of BP1 degradation with minimal leaching of CoFeNi alloy. Mechanisms of PMS activation and elimination path of BP1 by CFNC are also elucidated via the theoretical DFT calculation and experimental data to supply valuable information about behaviors of BP1 degraded by Hofmann MOF-derived magnetic catalysts.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Coal-based carbon/FeCo magnetic composites with layered stripes as novel
   light-weight microwave absorber
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB The introduction of magnetic materials into carbon materials has been proved to be an effective approach to tailor and improve electromagnetic wave (EM) absorption. In this study, coal-based carbon/FeCo (CBC/FeCo) magnetic composites were designed and prepared. These samples exhibit layered stripes similar to graphite. In these novel composites, the FeCo alloy exhibits strong magnetic loss and the coal-based carbon (CBC) not only acts as an impedance matching medium but also exhibits excellent dielectric loss. Therefore, the CBC/FeCo composites exhibit strong EM absorption, with minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of -60.81 and -49.82 dB at thicknesses (d) of 1.38 and 2.45 mm, respectively. Compared with pure coal-based carbon and FeCo alloy, the improvement in EM absorption can be mainly attributed to the improved impedance matching and enhanced multiple interfacial polarization. In addition, the effects of reaction temperature and the content of FeCo on EM absorption performance of the composites were also studied. Specifically, samples of S-2 with process temperature at 800 degrees C for 2 h and the FeCo alloy mass loading was 0.3 g (CBC/FeCo-0.3), the EM absorption performance was optimized. It is believed that the CBC/FeCo composites could be promising candidates for EM absorbers.

TI Copper-cobalt double metal cyanides as green catalysts for
   phosphoramidate synthesis
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY
AB Phosphoramidates are common and widespread backbones of a great variety of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, additives and natural products. Conventional approaches to their synthesis make use of toxic chlorinated reagents and intermediates, which are sought to be avoided at an industrial scale. Here we report the coupling of phosphites and amines promoted by a Cu-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)-based double metal cyanide heterogeneous catalyst using I-2 as additive for the synthesis of phosphoramidates. This strategy successfully provides an efficient, environmentally friendly alternative to the synthesis of these valuable compounds in high yields and it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first heterogeneous approach to this protocol. While the detailed study of the catalyst structure and of the metal centers by PXRD, FTIR, EXAFS and XANES revealed changes in their coordination environment, the catalyst maintained its high activity for at least 5 consecutive iterations of the reaction. Preliminary mechanism studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by a continuous change in the oxidation state of the Cu metal, induced by a O-2/I- redox cycle.
   Molecular framework materials have shown great promise as heterogeneous catalysts, but understanding the structural changes that such catalysts suffer over time remains challenging. Here, the environment around the metal centers of a Cu-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)-based double metal cyanide catalyst is studied before and after the synthesis of several phosphoramidates via an environmentally friendly route.

TI MXene-like carbon sheet/carbon nanotubes derived from metal-organic
   frameworks for efficient removal of tetracycline by non-radical
   dominated advanced oxidation processes
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived carbon with diversified structure and composition have received tremendous attention in persulfate advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Here, layer-by-layer MXene-like carbon sheet/carbon nanotubes (MCS/CNTs) were facilely prepared by pyrolysis of homologous MOF precursors. To present the influence of structure and composition on catalytic performance, different pyrolysis temperatures range from 700 to 1000 degrees C were applied to treat MOF precursor, and common antibiotic tetracycline hydro-chloride (TTCH) was selected as the targeted pollutant to degrade. The results indicated that under 900 degrees C generated MCS/CNTs-9 with maximum specific surface area displayed much higher adsorption capacity (35.9%) and faster degradation rate (0.26 min(-1)) than that of the others. The degradation mechanism was confirmed by radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. Degradation pathway was inferred by liquid chromatography-mass spectrograph (LC-MS), and a biotoxicity experiment of degradation products was carried out by culture of Escherichia coli. This work promotes the development of environmental nanomaterials and demonstrates the possibility of AOPs in water remediation.

TI Ammonium Ion Batteries: Material, Electrochemistry and Strategy
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs) have recently attracted increasing attention in the field of aqueous batteries owing to their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics. The NH4+ storage mechanism is quite different from that of spherical metal ions (e.g. Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between NH4+ and host materials. Although many materials have been proposed as electrode materials for AIBs, their performances hardly meet the requirement of future electrochemical energy storage devices. It is thus urgent to design and exploit advanced materials for AIBs. This review highlights the state-of-the-art research on AIBs. The insights into the basic configuration, operating mechanism and recent progress of electrode materials and corresponding electrolytes for AIBs have been comprehensively outlined. The electrode materials are classified and compared according to different NH4+ storage behaviour in the structure. The challenges, design strategies and perspectives are also discussed for the future development of AIBs.

TI Fabrication of CeO2/Co/C composites for high-efficiency
   electromagnetic wave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB CeO2/Co/C composites have been successfully prepared by a template method. When being applied as electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbers, CeO2/Co/C composites exhibit stronger EM wave absorption properties than Co/C and CeO2/C composites. The enhanced performance can be attributed to the unique structures of CeO2/Co/C composites, in which the synergistic effect of conductance loss, polarization loss together with magnetic loss play an important role for improving the EM wave absorption properties. Additionally, the CeO2/Co/C composites own more heterogeneous interfaces and high porosity, which promotes the continuous occurrence of interface polarization and dipole polarization, resulting in increased multiple scattering. The CeO2/Co/C composites show a RLmin of - 55.02 dB and an EAB of 3.29 GHz at the matching thickness of 2.82 mm. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing CeO2/Co/C composites for microwave absorbing material with high performances.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cu-substituted nickel hexacyanoferrate with tunable reaction potentials
   for superior ammonium ion storage
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, a variety of Cu x Ni 2-x Fe(CN) 6 ( x = 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2) cathodes for ammonium ion batteries are prepared and their electrochemical performances are investigated. During the introduction of copper in nickel hexacyanoferrate, the electrochemical performance varies without changing the structure of nickel hexacyanoferrate. The increase of Cu content in nickel hexacyanoferrate leads to the enhancement of reaction potential and capacity. Electrochemical results suggest that the substitution of Cu for Ni has a positive effect on improving the cycling stability and rate capacity of nickel hexacyanoferrate when x in Cu x Ni 2-x Fe(CN) 6 is less than 0.4. Therefore, Cu 0.4 Ni 1.6 Fe(CN) 6 exhibits the best cycling performance (capacity retention of 97.54% at 0.3 C) and the highest rate capacity (41.4 mAh g -1 at 10 C) in Cu x Ni 2-x Fe(CN) 6 . Additionally, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests also reveal that the structural evolution of Cu 0.4 Ni 1.6 Fe(CN) 6 is highly reversible upon NH 4 + storage. Therefore, this work proposes a candidate material for ammonium-ion batteries and offers a novel avenue for adjusting the operating potential of the material.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

TI Transition Metal Oxalate-Based Materials: An Emerging Material Family
   for Alkali-Ion Battery Cathodes
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Alkali-ion rechargeable batteries, including Li+/Na+/K+/Mg2+-ion batteries, etc., are promising technologies for energy storage applications. Polyanion compounds (PCs) represent an important cathode material category by virtue of their robust framework structures with facile alkali-ion migration paths and high-voltage properties derived from the inductive effect of anion groups. Many PCs have been well-studied, but the exploration of PCs is still fundamentally important for high-performance batteries. Recently, transition metal oxalate-based materials (TMOBMs) have emerged as a competitive cathode material family for diverse alkali-ion batteries. Oxalate anions (C2O42-) demonstrate strong and flexible coordinating ability with both redox-active transition metals and various anion groups (e.g., PO43-, SO42-, F-), leading to the exploration of many TMOBMs with diverse framework structures (including 1D chained, 2D layered, and 3D tunneled) and intriguing electrochemical properties. This review first focuses on the development of TMOBMs as cathode materials. Their classification, crystal structures, synthesis methods, physiochemical properties, and applications in Li+/Na+/K+/Mg2+-ion batteries are comprehensively introduced. Investigation of TMOBMs cathodes is at the early stage. We believe that this review is timely and of great significance to further enrich the family of PCs and promote their development and applications.

TI Observation of the correlation between the phonon frequency and

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB We show an anomalous change in the phonon frequency at the magnetic phase transition on a cyanide-bridged bimetal assembly, Mn-3[W(CN)(8)](2)(pyrimidine)(4)center dot 6H(2)O. This compound shows a frequency shift in the CN stretching mode below the magnetic phase transition temperature (T-C). First-principles phonon mode calculation and molecular orbital calculation suggest that the frequency shift of the CN stretching mode is due to the competition of the magnetic energy and the elastic energy. This work demonstrates that a specific change in the phonon frequency is induced by long-range magnetic ordering in flexibly structured matter.

TI Construction of metal-organic framework@cellulose nanofiber aerogel
   based on directional freezing for degradation of organic pollutants
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can efficiently degrade organic pollutants through advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, the retrieval of MOFs from the solution poses a considerable challenge due to their powdery nature, thereby restricting their potential applications. Herein, a composite aerogel loaded with MOFs on cellulose nanofiber aerogel was prepared by directional freezing technology, which has orderly pore arrangement and excellent degradation performance. Directional freezing Co-MIL-53(Fe)@CNF has regular arranged pore structure and metal catalytic sites, efficiently activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and promoting the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC). The free radical quenching experiment and the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiment concurrently suggest that sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals, as prominent free radical species, play crucial roles in the degradation of TC. The pH level of the solution exhibits no discernible influence on the degradation process, indicating that the aerogel has good pH tolerance. This work provides a new strategy for developing an effective catalyst to activate PMS to eliminate antibiotics.

TI Recent Progresses and Prospects of Cathode Materials for Non-aqueous
   Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Rechargeable potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries for application in large-scale energy storage systems due to their inexpensive and highly abundant resources. Recently, various anode materials have been investigated for use in KIBs, especially the traditional graphite anodes which have already been successfully applied in KIBs. In contrast, the appropriate cathode materials which are able to accommodate large K ions are urgently needed. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements in cathode materials for non-aqueous KIBs in terms of capacity, cycle life and energy density will be presented, as well as K-storage mechanisms. In addition, various strategies to improve K-storage performance will be provided through combining insights from the study of material structures and properties and thus bring low-cost non-aqueous KIBs a step closer to application in sustainable large-scale energy storage systems.

TI Self-assembly magnetized 3D hierarchical graphite carbon-based
   heterogeneous yolk-shell nanoboxes with enhanced microwave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Rational manipulation of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures can considerably enhance the performance of microwave absorption (MA) through the strong interface polarization caused by the abundant heterogeneous interfaces between low-dimensional components and the reflection loss resulting from voids and spaces within heterostructures. In this work, the yolk-shell structure with a 3D hierarchical graphite carbon (GC)/magnetic particle cubic core and an amorphous carbon shell is rationally constructed. With the help of the MOF-derived FeCo/GC template and the morphological stability role of residual SiO2 during the hydrothermal process, the reassembly of lamellar GC-based cores is obtained. The wise combination of GC and amorphous carbon provides the possibility of an appropriate graphitization degree. Moreover, nano-scale 3D magnetic coupling networks and various forms of component losses also play an active role in efficient attenuation. Therefore, the as-prepared absorber exhibits impressive MA performance, with an optimal reflection loss of as low as -60.03 dB and an effective absorption bandwidth of 7.04 GHz. This work provides a certain guideline for preparing 3D hierarchical graphite carbon-based heterogeneous microwave absorbers with improved performance, which can be achieved by the synergistic effect of multiple interfaces and multiple components.

TI Novel mixed nickel/cobalt hexacyanoferrate microcubes with synergistic
   effects for aqueous hybrid supercapacitors
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Combining different metals in coordination compounds is an efficient strategy to improve their various properties. Herein, mixed nickel-cobalt hexacyanoferrate (NixCoyHCF) microcubes of varying x : y molar ratios are synthesized via a co-precipitation route and comprehensively characterized to study their material and electrochemical properties. NixCoyHCF microcubes display the battery-type electrochemical energy storage mechanism in aqueous electrolytes. Among the samples, Ni1Co2HCF microcubes deliver the highest specific capacity of 134 mA h g-1 (1068 F g-1) at a specific current of 1 A g-1. This significant enhancement in the capacity indicates the synergistic and cooperative effects between Ni and Co sites in Ni1Co2HCF microcubes. The asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with Ni1Co2HCF microcubes delivers an excellent energy density of 74.4 mu W h cm-2 at a power density of 750 mu W cm-2 and retains 87.7% of its initial capacity after 2000 cycles at a current density of 5 mA cm-2, indicating its robust structural integrity and electrochemical durability. This study highlights the promising potential of mixed-metal hexacyanoferrates as high-performance electrodes for aqueous supercapacitors.

TI On-Demand Atomic Hydrogen Provision by Exposing Electron-Rich Cobalt
   Sites in an Open-Framework Structure toward Superior Electrocatalytic
   Nitrate Conversion to Dinitrogen
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3-) reduction to N-2 via atomic hydrogen (H*) is a promising approach for advanced water treatment. However, the reduction rate and N-2 selectivity are hindered by slow mass transfer and H* provision-utilization mismatch, respectively. Herein, we report an open-framework cathode bearing electron-rich Co sites with extraordinary H* provision performance, which was validated by electron spin resonance (ESR) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. Benefiting from its abundant channels, NO3- has a greater opportunity to be efficiently transferred to the vicinity of the Co active sites. Owing to the enhanced mass transfer and on-demand H* provision, the nitrate removal efficiency and N-2 selectivity of the proposed cathode were 100 and 97.89%, respectively, superior to those of noble metal-based electrodes. In addition, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) indicated that ultrafast *NO2- to *NO reduction and highly selective *NO to *N2O or *N transformation played crucial roles during the NO3- reduction process. Moreover, the proposed electrochemical system can achieve remarkable N-2 selectivity without the additional Cl- supply, thus avoiding the formation of chlorinated byproducts, which are usually observed in conventional electrochemical nitrate reduction processes. Environmentally, energy conservation and negligible byproduct release ensure its practicability for use in nitrate remediation.

TI In-situ hydrothermal synthesis of NiCo(X)Se compound on nickel foam for
   efficient performance of water splitting reaction in alkaline media
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB For energy generation process, developing highly effective and stable electrocatalysts as full water electrolyzers is necessary. In this study, quaternary NiCo(X)Se (X: Mg, Fe, Cu, Al, Mo, Sn, Zn) compounds were synthesized in-situ on nickel foam using a single-step hydrothermal procedure, and electrocatalytic properties were exam-ined for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline media. NiCo(Sn)Se electrocatalyst showed excellent properties for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, which required overpotentials of 91 mV for HER and 270 mV for OER to generate a current density of 10 mA.cm-2. Based on the electron microscopy observations and electrochemical assessments, this superior performance could be related to the microstructure evolution from plate-shape to micron size with nano-scale features that resulted in and enhanced electrochemical active sites and reduced charge transfer resistance of the NiCo(Sn) Se quaternary compound compared to the NiCoSe ternary compound. However, the best OER electrocatalytic performance was achieved for NiCo(Fe)Se with an overpotential of 250 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm-2. Furthermore, the NiCo(Sn)Se and NiCo(Fe)Se electrodes for HER and OER, respectively, showed outstanding electrocatalytic stability, which a current density of 10 mA.cm-2 remained constant at a certain overpotential over a 12 h of electrolysis.

TI Electrochemical performance of grown layer of Ni(OH)2 on nickel foam and
   treatment with phosphide and selenide for efficient water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Active nanocomposites synthesized by the electrochemical approach play a vital role in energy generation, conversion, and storage technologies. Recently, scientists began to explore the use of earth-rich transition metalbased materials to replace precious metal-based catalysts. Transition metals (TMs) based nickel (Ni) and their pnictides compounds such as phosphides and selenides exhibit good activity for hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER) and the entire water electrolysis process. In this study, we first prepared Ni(OH)2 and grown its layer on Ni foam (NF) and treated it with selenide (Se) and phosphide (P) then nickel-based selenide-phosphide catalyst (Ni-P-Se) was prepared by simultaneous selenization and phosphidation process for the first time. The asobtained composite was then analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), elemental mapping and transmission electron microscope (TEM) means to study the composition, structure, and micro-morphology of materials. Furthermore, we also observed electrocatalytic water splitting activity using electrochemical cell. The results of electrochemical tests depicted that the selenization and phosphidation treatments significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic HER activity of the starting materials. The overpotentials required for Ni-P-Se to reach 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2 were only 242 mV and 282 mV. The Tafel slope of Ni-P-Se is 151 mV dec-1, which is lower than that of nickel phosphide, selenide, and hydroxide indicating that selenide-phosphide enhances the HER reaction kinetics of the material, which in turn increases hydrogen output rate as compared with previous studies.

TI Water-in-salt electrolyte for safe and high-energy aqueous battery
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB As one of the most promising energy storage systems, conventional lithium-ion batteries based on the organic electrolyte have posed challenges to the safety, fabrication, and environmental friendliness. By virtue of the high safety and ionic conductivity of water, aqueous lithium-ion battery (ALIB) has emerged as a potential alternative. Whereas, the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of water severely restricts the performance of ALIB. In recent years, with the introduction of water-in-salt electrolyte (21 mol LiTFSI in 1 kg H2O), the ESW of aqueous electrolyte was expanded to similar to 3 V, which significantly improved the voltage and energy density of ALIBs. Nevertheless, in view of such high salt concentration, water-in-salt electrolyte will dramatically increase the cost of ALIBs. Hence, due to their lower cost and abundant resource, aqueous sodium-ion batteries and zinc-based batteries show great potential. Herein, the latest advances of water-in-salt electrolyte in aqueous rechargeable batteries are briefly reviewed. Some challenges and prospects of water-in-salt electrolyte are also discussed to broaden the horizons for future development.

TI Creation and stabilisation of tuneable open metal sites in
   thiocyanato-bridged heterometallic coordination polymers to be used as
   heterogeneous catalysts
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB A series of thiocyanato-bridged heterometallic coordination polymers with a 3D reticular network have been synthesised by the reaction of [Pt-IV(SCN)(6)](2-) with M-II ions to form {M-II[Pt-IV(SCN)(6)]}(n) and {[M-II(CH3OH)(2)][Pt-IV(SCN)(6)]}(n) (M-II = Mn-II, Fe-II, Co-II, Ni-II or Cu-II) in water and methanol, respectively. Single-crystal X-ray analyses revealed the absence of open metal sites in {M-II[Pt-IV(SCN)(6)]}(n)s and the formation of potential open metal sites at the M-II ions of {[M-II(CH3OH)(2)][Pt-IV(SCN)(6)]}(n)s by the coordination of methanol. One of the two coordinating methanol molecules in {[Co-II(CH3OH)(2)][Pt-IV(SCN)(6)]}(n) was replaced with pyridine to stabilise the open metal sites, because the methanol molecules are too labile to maintain open metal sites in water. The heterogeneous catalysis of coordination polymers with and without open metal sites was examined for organophosphate hydrolysis and photocatalytic water oxidation to clarify the requisites for heterogeneous catalysts.

   preparation, characterization, and challenge for the Suzuki-Miyaura
   coupling of aryl chlorides under mild conditions
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Because of their abundance and low cost, organo chlorides are the most desirable substrates from the industrial point of view in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. However, catalytic application of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) for Suzuki coupling of aryl chlorides is still a challenge. Here, we design a novel catalyst by combining Pd NPs with Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanocrystals for Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of aryl chlorides. This nanocatalyst demonstrated good activity (yield 86.2% at 80 degrees C), high TOF, great stability, easy separation, excellent reusability (initial rates were not reduced after five cycles) and low cost in Suzuki reactions.

TI Cobalt particles encapsulated and nitrogen-doped bamboo-like carbon
   nanotubes as a catalytic and adsorptive bifunctional material for
   efficient removal of organic pollutants from wastewater
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Bifunctional materials having both good catalytic and adsorptive performances are promising in the field of wastewater treatment. Cobalt-encapsulated and nitrogen-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (Co/N-CNTs) were prepared by a simple method of calcination and acid treatment with Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) as a precursor. Based on a series of characterization and performance studies, Co/N-CNTs were confirmed to be able to function as both a catalyst and an adsorbent for oxidative degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). When rhodamine B was used as a typical dye pollutant, it was found that all the added pollutant (10 mg L-1) was completely removed in 7 min by using 0.1 g L-1 Co/N-CNTs and 0.2 g L-1 PMS. The fast and efficient degradation of the pollutant was attributed to the synergistic effect between adsorption and catalysis on the surface of Co/N-CNTs. It was confirmed that this bifunctional material provided good performances in a wide range of operation conditions, such as a wide temperature range and a wide pH range. Co/NCNTs also exhibited a good recyclability. A mechanism study indicated that the main active species in the catalytic oxidation process was surface-bound SO4%-and % OH.

TI Highly selective enrichment of radioactive cesium from solution by using
   zinc hexacyanoferrate(III)-functionalized magnetic bentonite
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Realizing highly effective and selective enrichment of radioactive Cs(I) in complex environmental systems and exploring the microscale adsorption mechanism of Cs(I) on adsorbing material is the key point for developing highly efficient materials for Cs(I) adsorption. In addition, the low cytotoxicity of materials is essential for practical applications and environmental protection. In this study, the controlled assembly of bentonite carrier with a highly selective substance of Cs(I) is prepared by in-situ synthesis method in order to construct a low-toxic functional clay material with high adsorption capacity and selectivity of Cs (I) in complex environmental systems. The efficiency of the zinc hexacyanoferrate(III)-grafted magnetic bentonite (denoted as ZHF/MB) composite was evaluated in adsorption isotherm studies, kinetics analyses, and selectivity tests by using the batch technique. The toxicity of the ZHF/MB composite was evaluated through in vitro cytotoxicity assays using human hepatic cells (HepG2 cells). The results revealed that the ZHF/MB composite had not only a higher adsorption capacity (1.638 mmol/g, 60 degrees C) for Cs+ ions than a number of other natural and manmade materials but also no cytotoxicity in human cells. In addition, the ZHF/MB composite showed excellent selectivity for Cs' with a removal efficiency of over 90% from solution (m/V = 0.4 g/L, [Mn+](initial) = 10 mg/L, Mn+= Cs+, Ni2+, Sr2+,Co2+). The promising safe toxicology profile, remarkable Cs' adsorption efficiency, and excellent selectivity of the ZHF/MB composite demonstrate its great potential for using as a decorporation agent for radioactive cesium remediation. The implementation of this research will provide new adsorption materials and method for radioactive Cs(I) waste management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Modification of ZnCoPBA by different organic ligands and its application
   in the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Double metal cyanide (DMC) structures of Zn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) were modified by different organic ligands and tested for their catalytic activity in the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides. ZnCoPBAs show an face-centred cubic structure with a high density of Lewis acidic Co(II)/Zn(II) metal sites and basic -CN-groups. The high crystallinity and excellent textural properties of the prepared ZnCoPBAs materials were confirmed by XRD and the N-2 adsorption-desorption. We found the morphology and structure of ZnCoPBAs are related to the polarity of organic ligands. Through the analysis of morphology, crystallinity, specific surface area and pore size, explored the influence of different organic ligands on the catalytic performance of ZnCoPBAs. ZnCoPBA-TBA exhibited higher catalytic activity than other catalysts (ZnCoPBA-DMF, ZnCoPBA-MT, ZnCoPBA-ET). For a given catalyst weight, ZnCoPBA-TBA showed the best catalytic performance among the tested ZnCoPBAs, and the conversion rate of propylene oxide higher than 95% under relatively qualitative reaction conditions (2.0 MPa, 353 K).

TI Molecular Clusters: Nanoscale Building Blocks for Solid-State Materials
SO ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB The programmed assembly of nanoscale building blocks into multicomponent hierarchical structures is a powerful strategy for the bottom-up construction of functional materials. To develop this concept, our team has explored the use of molecular clusters as superatomic building blocks to fabricate new classes of materials. The library of molecular clusters is rich with exciting properties, including diverse functionalization, redox activity, and magnetic ordering, so the resulting cluster-assembled solids, which we term superatomic crystals (SACs), hold the promise of high tunability, atomic precision, and robust architectures among a diverse range of other material properties.& para;& para;Molecular clusters have only seldom been used as precursors for functional materials. Our team has been at the forefront of new developments in this exciting research area, and this Account focuses on our progress toward designing materials from cluster-based precursors. In particular, this Account discusses (1) the design and synthesis of molecular cluster superatomic building blocks, (2) their self-assembly into SACs, and (3) their resulting collective properties.& para;& para;The set of molecular clusters discussed herein is diverse, with different cluster cores and ligand arrangements to create an impressive array of solids. The cluster cores include octahedral M6E8 and cubane M4E4 (M = metal; E = chalcogen), which are typically passivated by a shell of supporting ligands, a feature upon which we have expanded upon by designing and synthesizing more exotic ligands that can be used to direct solid-state assembly. Building from this library, we have designed whole families of binary SACs where the building blocks are held together through electrostatic, covalent, or van der Waals interactions. Using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) to determine the atomic structure, a remarkable range of compositional variability is accessible. We can also use this technique, in tandem with vibrational spectroscopy, to ascertain features about the constituent superatomic building blocks, such as the charge of the cluster cores, by analysis of bond distances from the SCXRD data.& para;& para;The combination of atomic precision and intercluster interactions in these SACs produces novel collective properties, including tunable electrical transport, crystalline thermal conductivity, and ferromagnetism. In addition, we have developed a synthetic strategy to insert redox-active guests into the superstructure of SACs via single-crystal-to-single-crystal intercalation. This intercalation process allows us to tune the optical and electrical transport properties of the superatomic crystal host. These properties are explored using a host of techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, electrical transport measurements, electronic absorption spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and frequency-domain thermoreflectance. Superatomic crystals have proven to be both robust and tunable, representing a new method of materials design and architecture. This Account demonstrates how precisely controlling the structure and properties of nanoscale building blocks is key in developing the next generation of functional materials; several examples are discussed and detailed herein.

TI High-capacity and selective ammonium removal from water using sodium
   cobalt hexacyanoferrate
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB A new NH4+ adsorbent with high capacity and selectivity, sodium cobalt(u) hexacyanoferrate(u) (NaCoHCF, NayCo(II) [Fe2+(CN)(6)](x)center dot zH(2)O), was prepared. The adsorption performance was investigated by varying the mixing ratio of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) to Co2+ during synthesis, R-m(ix). The ammonia capacity was found to be proportional to R-m(ix),( )indicating that the NH4+ capacity can be increased by increasing the Na+-ion content in NaCoHCF. To conduct a detailed study, we prepared homogeneous nanoparticles by flow synthesis using a micromixer with R-m(ix) = 1.00. Even on the addition of a saline solution (NaCl) with an Na+-ion concentration of 9350 mg L-1, the capacity was maintained: q(m)(ax) = 4.28 mol kg(-1). Using Markham-Benton analysis, the selectivity factor, defined by the ratio of equilibrium constants for NH4+ to that for Na+, was calculated to be alpha = 96.2, and 4.36 mol kg(-1) was found to be the maximum capacity. The high selectivity of NaCoHCF results in good NH4+-adsorption performance, even from seawater. In comparison with other adsorbents under the same conditions and even for a NH4O solution, NaCoHCF showed the highest capacity. Moreover, the coexisting Na+ caused no interference with the adsorption of ammonium by NaCoHCF, whereas the other adsorbents adsorbed ammonia only slightly from the saline solution. We also found that the pores for NH4+ adsorption changed their sizes and shapes after adsorption.

TI Improved Electrochemical Performance in an Exfoliated
   Tetracyanonickelate-Based Metal-Organic Framework
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Tetracyanonickelate (TCN)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show great potential in electrochemical applications such as supercapacitors due to their layered morphology and tunable structure. This study reports on improved electrochemical performance of exfoliated manganese tetracyanonickelate (Mn-TCN) nanosheets produced by the heat-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) technique. The structural change was confirmed by the Raman frequency shift of the C equivalent to N band from 2177 to 2182 cm(-1) and increased band gap from 3.15 to 4.33 eV in the exfoliated phase. Statistical distribution obtained from atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that 50% of the nanosheets are single-to-four-layered and have an average lateral size of similar to 240 nm(2) and thickness of similar to 1.2-4.8 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns suggest that the material maintains its crystallinity after exfoliation. It exhibits an almost 6-fold improvement in specific capacitance (from 13.0 to 72.5 F g(-1)) measured at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurement shows a capacity enhancement from similar to 18 F g(-1) in the bulk phase to similar to 45 F g(-1) in the exfoliated phase at a current density of 1 A g(-1). Bulk crystals exhibit an increasing trend of capacitance retention by similar to 125% over 1000 charge-discharge cycles attributed to electrochemical exfoliation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrates a 5-fold reduction in the total equivalent series resistance (ESR) from 4864 Omega (bulk) to 1089 Omega (exfoliated). The enhanced storage capacity in the exfoliated phase results from the combined effect of the electrochemical double-layer charge storage mechanism at the nanosheet-electrolyte interface and the Faradic process characteristic of the pseudocapacitive charge storage behavior.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The rational construction of the chemical composition and morphological structure of electrocatalysts has been considered as the key to their electrochemical performance and energy storage. Herein, we report the facile fabrication of the hierarchical Ni2P-Co2P-Fe2P hybrid hollow nanoprism (abbreviated as NiCoFeP-HN), which could efficiently work as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in the rechargeable Zn-air battery. NiCoFeP-HN was synthesized via an in situ ion exchange reaction of nickel-cobalt precursors with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) at room temperature and the subsequent phosphorization at 300 degrees C under N-2. The ion exchange procedure was crucial for preserving the nanoprism morphology and enhancing the OER performance. NiCoFeP-HN exhibited satisfactory activity with a small overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability for over 12 h. Compared to the conventional RuO2 + Pt/C Zn-air battery, the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C based Zn-air battery has exhibited superior energy density and much better cycling stability. This work presents a facile and efficient avenue for the construction of hollow nanostructures and hybrid compositions, and provides a promising candidate with good electrochemical performance and energy storage.

TI Citrus sap-stabilized regulated cobalt ferricyanide efficiently enhanced
   electrocatalytic activity and durability for oxygen evolution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Water electrolysis is considered the most promising technology for hydrogen production. In the present study, RCoFe (regulated cobalt ferricyanide) is synthesized via the co-precipitation method, which is characterized by physical and electrochemical properties. XRD confirmed the crystalline phase of RCoFe and the diffraction peaks are consistent with JCPDS#82-2284. FE-SEM examines the nanoplatelet morphology, which could help with the mass transfer of electrons during the electrochemical process. Here, RCoFe promotes the extensive activity for the OER (oxygen evolution reaction) with 270 mV/GC; 252 mV/NF at 10 mA cm-2. The lower Tafel value for RCoFe (78 mV dec-1/GC; 107 mV dec-1/NF) was derived from LSV when compared to IrO2 (98 mV dec-1/GC; 123 mV dec-1/NF) and stable for a long time with minimal loss of potential (130 h/GC-1.5%; 250 h/NF-1.8%) owing to citrus sap, which stabilized the electrocatalyst. After electrochemical treatment, the post-SEM morphology reveals that the nanoplatelets are completely bound together to enhance the OER process.
   Citrus sap-stabilized RCoFe nanoplatelets were synthesized by simple co-precipitation, and are highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for solar cell water splitting (1.56 V).

TI The phase diagrams of the mixed-spin ternary-alloy consisting of
   half-integer spins: Standard-random approach
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The ternary-alloy in the form AB(p)C(1-p) is investigated on the Bethe lattice with the odd numbered shells containing only A atoms (spin-1/2), while the even shells randomly containing either B (spin-3/2) or C (spin-5/2) atoms with different concentrations p and 1 - p, respectively. The phase diagrams are calculated on the ( p, kT(c)/J(AB)) and (R = |J(AC)|/J(AB), kT(c)/J(AB)) planes for given values of R and p, respectively, with the coordination numbers z = 3, 4, 5 and 6 by studying the thermal variations of the order-parameters. It is found that there exist a critical value of R, i.e. R-c congruent to 0.653, which is independent of z. In addition, the critical temperatures increase as z increases. The present work is an extension of the previous work [1] and it only differs from it by the implementation technique of randomness into the model. The obtained phase diagrams are in agreement with the site-dependent random case [1] except at low temperatures. On the other hand, there is an overall agreement with the literature.

TI Fast Charging Sodium-Ion Full Cell Operated From-50 °C to 90 °C
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) within grid-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) critically hinges upon fast charging technology. However, challenges arise particularly with anodes such as hard carbon (HC), which exhibits a low working plateau (less than 0.1 V vs Na/Na+) and is susceptible to sodium dendrite issues under high current densities. In this study, a cost-effective SIB system comprising Na2.4Fe1.8(SO4)3 (NFS) cathode, NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) anode, and ester-based electrolyte is assembled to solve the fast-charging obstacle. Benefiting from the fast sodium-ion diffusion kinetics and relatively high voltage platform of NTP anode, this full cell can work for 10 000 cycles at 10 C rate with a notable capacity retention of 70.7%. Moreover, this investigation reveals that the full cell can operate safely between -50 to 90 degrees C even with an ester-based electrolyte, thereby showcasing broad application prospects. This work provides a valuable guidance for designing fast charging and wide temperature SIBs.

TI Core-shell hexacyanoferrate for superior Na-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (Fe-HCF) is regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity, low cost, facile synthesis and environmentally friendly. However, Fe-HCF always suffers from poor electronic conductivity, low crystallinity and side reactions with electrolyte, leading to poor rate performance, low coulombic efficiency and deterioration of cycling stability. Herein, we report a green and facile synthesis to encapsulate Fe-HCF microcubes with potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate (Ni-HCF). The core-shell Fe-HCF@Ni-HCF composite delivers a reversible capacity of 79.7 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after 800 cycles and a high coulombic efficiency of 99.3%. In addition, Fe-HCF@Ni-HCF exhibits excellent rate performance, retaining 60 mAh g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1). The results show that Fe-HCF@Ni-HCF integrates the advantages of both Fe-HCF and Ni-HCF, making it electrochemically stable as cathode material for SIBs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

All of the six complexes have been characterized using elemental analysis, IR spectra, and powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Structural analysis revealed diverse structural types of complexes 1-6, ranging from discrete polynuclear entities (1) to a 1D single chain (2) to 2D (3, 5 and 6) and 3D (4) networks, clearly indicating the important role of the building block in tuning the structures of the target complexes. The magnetic properties of the reported cyanide-bridged complexes have been experimentally studied and theoretically simulated, disclosing ferro- or antiferromagnetic coupling between the low spin Fe(m) ion and Cu(s) ion and the antiferromagnetic interaction between the CO) ion and the Cu(ii) ion through the cyanide bridge. Furthermore, the nature of the magnetic coupling has been analysed based on the magneto-structural correlation.

TI The nature of chemical bonding in actinide and lanthanide ferrocyanides
   determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional
   theory
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The electronic properties of actinide cations are of fundamental interest to describe intramolecular interactions and chemical bonding in the context of nuclear waste reprocessing or direct storage. The 5f and 6d orbitals are the first partially or totally vacant states in these elements, and the nature of the actinide ligand bonds is related to their ability to overlap with ligand orbitals. Because of its chemical and orbital selectivities, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is an effective probe of actinide species frontier orbitals and for understanding actinide cation reactivity toward chelating ligands. The soft X-ray probes of the light elements provide better resolution than actinide L-3-edges to obtain electronic information from the ligand. Thus coupling simulations to experimental soft X-ray spectral measurements and complementary quantum chemical calculations yields quantitative information on chemical bonding. In this study, soft X-ray XAS at the K-edges of C and N, and the L-2,L-3-edges of Fe was used to investigate the electronic structures of the well-known ferrocyanide complexes K4FeII(CN)(6), thorium hexacyanoferrate (ThFeII)-Fe-IV(CN)(6), and neodymium hexacyanoferrate (KNdFeII)-Fe-III(CN)(6). The soft X-ray spectra were simulated based on quantum chemical calculations. Our results highlight the orbital overlapping effects and atomic effective charges in the Fe-II(CN)(6) building block. In addition to providing a detailed description of the electronic structure of the ferrocyanide complex (K4FeII(CN)(6)), the results strongly contribute to confirming the actinide 5f and 6d orbital oddity in comparison to lanthanide 4f and 5d.

TI Bimetallic nickel cobalt sulfides with hierarchical coralliform
   architecture for ultrafast and stable Na-ion storage
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB A series of bimetallic nickel cobalt sulfides with hierarchical micro/nano architectures were fabricated via a facile synthesis strategy of bimetallic micro/nano structure precursor construction-anion exchange via solvothermal method. Among the nickel cobalt sulfides with different Ni/Co contents, the coral-like Ni1.01Co1.99S4 (Ni/Co, 1/2) delivers ultrafast and stable Na-ion storage performance (350 mAh.g(-1) after 1,000 cycles at 1 A.g(-1) and 355 mAh.g(-1) at 5 A.g(-1)). The remarkable electrochemical properties can be attributed to the enhanced conductivity by co-existence of bimetallic components, the unique coral-like micro/nanostructure, which could prevent structural collapse and self-aggregation of nanoparticles, and the easily accessibility of electrolyte, and fast Na+ diffusion upon cycling. Detailed kinetics studies by a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) reveal the dynamic change of Na+ diffusion upon cycling, and quantitative kinetic analysis indicates the high contribution of pseudocapacitive behavior during charge-discharge processes. Moreover, the ex-situ characterization analysis results further verify the Na-ion storage mechanism based on conversion reaction. This study is expected to provide a feasible design strategy for the bimetallic sulfides materials toward high performance sodium-ion batteries.

TI Rapid YFeO3 gas sensor for detecting formaldehyde working at room
   temperature
SO CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The YFeO3 (12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h) microcrystals were prepared by hydrothermal process. Structural characterization using X-ray diffraction confirms the orthorhombic perovskite of the synthesized materials. YFeO3 based gas sensor has good selectivity to formaldehyde. The response value of YFeO3 (72 h) sensor is up to 318 for 100 ppm formaldehyde at room temperature. Furthermore, YFeO3 has an ultra-fast response-recovery time of about 6.3 s/0.9 s and exhibits excellent cycle repeatability and stability. This trait can play significant practical role in kind of sensors with real-time detectability. Further SEM and XPS analysis suggest that enhanced sensing property can be related to the uniform hierarchical structure and high oxygen vacancies. Our research indicates that adjusting the experimental approach can alter the structural and sensing properties of the sample.

TI SiC@FeZnZiF as a Bifunctional Catalyst with Catalytic Activating PMS and
   Photoreducing Carbon Dioxide
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Herein, we encapsulated modified silicon carbide nanoparticles utilizing a metal-organic backbone. E-SiC-FeZnZIF composites were successfully prepared via Fe doping. The catalysis activity of this bifunctional composite material was evaluated by the degradation of tetracycline (THC) and carbamazepine (CBZ) and the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). Nano SiC has received widespread attention in advanced oxidation applications, especially in the catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). However, the inferior activity of SiC has severely restricted its practical use. In this study of dual functional composite materials, nano SiC was firstly etched under aqueous alkali. Then, zeolite imidazolate frame-8 (ZIF-8) was used for immobilization. The filling of the etched nano SiC with FeZnZiF was confirmed by SEM, XRD, FTIR, BET, and XPS analyses. In addition, E-SiC-FeZnZIF exhibited excellent catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to oxidize water pollutants, which can degrade tetracycline hydrochloride (THC), achieving a removal rate of 72% within 60 min. Moreover, E-SiC-FeZnZIF exhibited a relatively high CO2 reduction rate with H2O. The yields of CO and CH4 were 0.085 and 0.509 mu mol g(-1), respectively, after 2 h, which are higher than that of 50 nm of commercial SiC (CO: 0.084 mu mol g(-1); CH4: 0.209 mu mol g(-1)). This work provides a relatively convenient synthesis path for constructing metal skeleton composites for advanced oxidation and photocatalytic applications. This will have practical significance in protecting water bodies and reducing CO2, which are vital not only for maintaining the natural ecological balance and negative feedback regulation, but also for creating a new application carrier based on nano silicon carbide.

TI High-Performance Manganese Hexacyanoferrate with Cubic Structure as
   Superior Cathode Material for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaxMnFe(CN)(6)) is one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the high voltage and low cost. However, its cycling performance is limited by the multiple phase transitions during Na+ insertion/extraction. In this work, a facile strategy is developed to synthesize cubic and monoclinic structured NaxMnFe(CN)(6), and their structure evolutions are investigated through in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations. It is revealed that the monoclinic phase undergoes undesirable multiple two-phase reactions (monoclinic <-> cubic <-> tetragonal) due to the large lattice distortions caused by the Jahn-Teller effects of Mn3+, resulting in poor cycling performances with 38% capacity retention. The cubic NaxMnFe(CN)(6) with high structural symmetry maintains the structural stability during the repeated Na+ insertion/extraction process, demonstrating impressive electrochemical performances with specific capacity of approximate to 120 mAh g(-1) at 3.5 V (vs Na/Na+), capacity retention of approximate to 70% over 500 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). In addition, the TiO2//C-MnHCF full battery is fabricated with an energy density of 111 Wh kg(-1), suggesting the great potential of cubic NaxMnFe(CN)(6) for practical energy storage applications.

TI Double functionalization of N-doped carbon carved hollow nanocubes with
   mixed metal phosphides as efficient bifunctional catalysts for
   electrochemical overall water splitting
SO NANO ENERGY
AB A double functionalization approach was developed to create efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for electrochemical overall water splitting. Uniform Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot 12H(2)O nanocubes were taken as the starting material to fabricate the bifunctional catalysts through ammonia carving, conformal polydopamine coating, precursor metal ion coordination, and thermal phosphorization. N-doped carbon carved hollow nanocubes were loaded with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active (Ni-Co) phosphides in the interior cyanide-derived carbon layers and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active (Ni-Fe) phosphides on the exterior polydopaimne-derived carbon layers. The product catalyst exhibited excellent electrolytic performances, achieving overpotentials of 251 and 142 mV for the OER and HER, respectively and a working cell voltage of 1.63 V for the overall water splitting all at 10 mA/cm(2). Holes of several tens nanometers in size located at the eight vertices of the hollow cube allow easy access of the electrolyte to and fast rejection of evolving gas bubbles from the interior of the cube. The N-doped carbon nanocubes, providing fast charge transport pathway, and the positive synergistic effects arising from the mixed metal phosphides, significantly enhanced catalytic performances of the product catalyst. Both quantity and quality of the active sites are largely improved with the doubly functionalized N-doped carbon carved hollow nanocubes, which is a superior catalyst design for all electrocatalytic applications.

TI Deciphering the Unusual Pressure-Induced Electron Transfer in the
   Molecular Switch
   {[Fe(Tp)(CN)3]2[Co(vbik)2]2}
   <middle dot>(BF4)2<middle dot>2MeOH
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Cyanide-bridged FeCo coordination clusters featuring reversible electron transfer are appealing molecular switches whose physical properties can be controlled by a variety of external stimuli. In this work, we reveal the origins of the atypical pressure-induced electron transfer-coupled transition (ETCST) in the compound {[Fe(Tp)(CN)(3)](2)[Co(vbik)(2)](2)}<middle dot>(BF4)(2)<middle dot>2MeOH (1), which is characterized by (i) an efficient and complete transition of the diamagnetic (FeLSCoLSIII)-Co-II pairs into paramagnetic (FeLSCoHSII)-Co-III pairs at moderate pressure and (ii) the occurrence of a p-enhanced cooperativity. Compound 1 which appears paramagnetic in the 2-400 K temperature range at ambient pressure is actually shown to be kinetically trapped in the Fe-III-CN-Co-II state. Magnetic measurements at a low scan rate (0.01 K/min) actually reveal an inflection point near 140 K and a transition toward the diamagnetic state on cooling. The pressure-induced ETCST of 1 at room temperature was probed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction on a single crystal. The variation of the unit cell parameters versus pressure (p) permits determination of the lattice elastic properties. We find a remarkably strong pressure dependence of the bulk modulus for p -> 0 (dB/dp), which was used, through a simple continuum mechanics model, to explain the unusual switching behavior. To go further, we demonstrated that dB/dp is related probably to the specific distortion of the core structure of 1. We also made the first steps in the correlation of the bulk elastic properties and the microscopic structure of the molecular materials. Two determining intermolecular interactions are revealed in 1 through Hirshfeld surface analysis: the first ones are created by the short contacts of a pair of blocking ligands in pi-pi stacking on the Co site which runs alongside the a direction, and the second ones are mediated by BF4- anions running in the c direction. Interestingly, the linear bulk moduli in the a and c directions could be correlated to these two intermolecular interactions. The variation of the linear bulk moduli versus pressure indicates that the connectivity of BF4- counteranions seems to play a primordial role at low pressure (<0.46 GPa), while the pi-pi stacking becomes predominant at higher pressure. This reveals the complexity of large molecular systems and the need for physical models that take it into account.

TI An Electrochemical Sensor for Hydrazine Based on In Situ Grown
   Cobalt Hexacyanoferrate Nanostructured Film
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB There is a growing demand for simple, cost-effective, and accurate analytical tools to determine the concentrations of biological and environmental compounds. In this study, a stable electroactive thin film of cobalt hexacyanoferrate (Cohcf) was prepared as an in situ chemical precipitant using electrostatic adsorption of Co2+ on a silicate sol-gel matrix (SSG)-modified indium tin oxide electrode pre-adsorbed with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions. The modified electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. Electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine on the modified electrode was studied. An electrochemical sensor for hydrazine was constructed on the SSG-Cohcf-modified electrode. The oxidation peak currents showed a linear relationship with the hydrazine concentration. This study provides insight into the in situ growth and stability behavior of Cohcf nanostructures and has implications for the design and development of advanced electrode materials for fuel cells and sensor applications.

TI Na-Mn-O Nanocrystals as a High Capacity and Long Life Anode Material for
   Li-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Searching for a new material to build the next-generation rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high electrochemical performance is urgently required. Owing to the low-cost, non-toxicity, and high-safety, the family of manganese oxide including the Na-Mn-O system is regarded as one of the most promising electrode materials for LIBs. Herein, a new strategy is carried out to prepare a highly porous and electrochemically active Na0.55Mn2O4 center dot 1.5H(2)O (SMOH) compound. As an anode material, the Na-Mn-O nanocrystal material dispersed within a carbon matrix manifests a high reversible capacity of 1015.5 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1). Remarkably, a considerable capability of 546.8 mA h g(-1) remains even after 2000 discharge/charge cycles at the higher current density of 4 A g(-1), indicating a splendid cyclability. The exceptional electrochemical properties allow SMOH to be a promising anode material toward LIBs.

TI Recent progress on MOFs and their derivative-carbon fiber composite
   materials for oxygen electrocatalysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the key reactions in fuel cells and metal-air batteries, which are crucial in the development of new environmentally friendly energy storage devices. In recent years, MOFs and their derivative-carbon fiber composite materials have been designed as high-performance oxygen electrocatalysts, which exhibit excellent catalytic performance owing to their uniformly distributed active sites, unique porosity, flexible tunability and high electrical conductivity. This review summarizes the research progress on MOFs combined with carbon fiber composite materials as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction. Firstly, the methods for the synthesis of MOF-carbon fiber composite materials and MOF derivative-carbon fiber materials are briefly introduced and the different effects of each method on their catalytic properties are discussed in detail. Then, by analyzing the ORR and OER mechanisms and activity descriptors of the reaction, mechanisms for the regulation of ORR and OER using some MOFs and their derivative-carbon fiber composite materials are deeply investigated based on five aspects including component regulation, structural regulation, size effect, interface engineering and defect engineering. Finally, some detailed challenges and future perspectives of MOFs and their derivative-carbon fiber composite materials for practical applications as electrocatalysts in energy devices are presented. This review can provide a reference for exploring more types of MOFs and their derivatives with carbon fibers to form novel composite materials with higher catalytic activity, effectively promoting their applications in fields such as energy conversion and storage.
   Based on the oxygen electrocatalytic mechanism, MOFs and their derivative-carbon fiber composites have shown excellent catalytic performance by optimizing the reaction regulation mechanism, which will promote the development of electrocatalysts.

TI KTiOPO4: A long-life, high-rate and low-temperature-workable
   host for Na/K-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Discovering high-performance electrode materials for Na/K-ion batteries (NIBs/KIBs) is crucially important for the development of low-cost energy storage systems. Herein, a kind of well-crystallized KTiOPO4 nanoparticles is reported as a long-life, high-rate and low-temperature-workable host for Na/K ions batteries. Without any carbon coating and high-temperature treatment, the resulting KTiOPO4 nanoparticles exhibit impressive electrochemical performance in Na/K-ion batteries, in terms of high reversible capacities, superior rate capabilities (103.0 mA h g(-1) at 100C in NIBs and 83.6 mA h g(-1) at 20C in KIBs) and outstanding cycling stability (91% capacity retention at 30C in NIBs after 1000 cycles and 78.4% capacity retention at 20C in KIBs after 10,000 cycles). Extraordinarily, it can be cycled well at low temperatures (no capacity decay after 550 cycles at 3C and -35 degrees C) and in Na-ion full cells. Besides, it is demonstrated that the outstanding electrochemical performance could be attributed to the stable framework and highly reversible reactions during the Na+/K+ (de)insertion process. These findings prove that the as-reported KTiOPO4 product is a promising candidate as Na/K-ion reservoirs.

TI Sub-5 nm Ultrasmall Metal-Organic Framework Nanocrystals for Highly
   Efficient Electrochemical Energy Storage
SO ACS NANO
AB Synthesis of ultrasmall metal organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles has been widely recognized as a promising route to greatly enhance their properties but remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report one facile and effective spatially confined thermal pulverization strategy to successfully transform bulk Co-MOF particles into sub-5 nm nanocrystals encapsulated within N-doped carbon/graphene (NC/G) by using conducting polymer coated Co-MOFs/graphene oxide as precursors. This strategy involves a feasible mechanism: calcination of Co-MOFs at proper temperature in air induces the partial thermal collapse/distortion of the framework, while the uniform coating of a conducting polymer can significantly improve the decomposition temperature and maintain the component stability of Co-MOFs, thus leading to the pulverization of bulk Co-MOF particles into ultrasmall nanocrystals without oxidation. The pulverization of Co-MOFs significantly increases the contact area between Co-MOFs with electrolyte and shortens the electron and ion transport pathway. Therefore, the sub-5 nm ultrasmall MOF nanocrystals-based composites deliver an ultrahigh reversible capacity (1301 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), extraordinary rate performance (494 mAh g(-1) at 40 A g(-1)), and outstanding cycling stability (98.6% capacity retention at 10 A g(-1) after 2000 cycles), which is the best performance achieved in all reported MOF-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries.

TI Control of the Phase Stability in Spin-Crossover Core-Shell
   Nanoparticles through the Elastic Interface Energy
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Size reduction leads to drastic changes in thermodynamic properties in spin-crossover (SCO) nano-objects in comparison with bulk materials. In particular, an important modification of the phase stability has been observed, reflected by a shift of the transition temperature. These changes are mostly attributed to the increasing role of surface properties at the nanoscale, especially the elastic properties, which play a key role in SCO phenomena. In this work, we propose a continuum mechanics approach to explore the possibility to tune the phase stability by controlling the interfacial elastic energy in core-shell nanoparticles with (semi-) coherent interface. To this aim, the pressure at the particle surface/interface is analytically derived in the case of hollow and core-shell nano-objects. Then, the extracted interfacial energy is injected in a thermodynamic model to mimic the spin-transition curves in the framework of the effective medium approximation. A structural misfit between a SCO core and an inactive shell produces a negative or positive pressure on the SCO material, favoring either the high-spin or the low-spin states and thus can down-shift or upshift the transition temperature. These theoretical results provide real perspectives for the control of the spin transition at the nanoscale via interfacial energies, as the design of core-shell coordination nanoparticles and other heterostructures has been considerably developed in recent years.

TI Switching Optimally Balanced Fe-N Interaction Enables Extremely Stable
   Energy Storage
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS
AB The interaction between electrode materials and charge carriers is one of the central issues dominating underlying energy storage mechanisms. To address the notoriously significant volume changes accompanying intercalation or formation of alloy/compounds, we aim to introduce and utilize a weak, reversible Fe-N interaction during the (de)intercalation of ammonium ions (NH4+) within iron(III) hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF), inspired by manipulating the electrostatic adsorption between N and Fe in the early stages of ammonia synthesis (Bosch-Harber Process, Chemical Engineering) and steel nitriding processes (Metal Industry). Such strategy of switching well-balanced Fe-N interaction is confirmed in between the nitrogen of ammonium ions and high-spin Fe in FeHCF, as observed by using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The resulting material provided an extremely stable energy storage (58 mAh g(-1) after 10 000 cycles at current density of 1 A g(-1)) as well as high-rate performance (23.6 mAh g(-1) at current density of 10 A g(-1)).

TI Elevating the Practical Application of Sodium-Ion Batteries through
   Advanced Characterization Studies on Cathodes
SO ENERGIES
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as promising alternatives to their lithium-ion counterparts due to the abundance of sodium resources and their potential for cost-effective energy storage solutions. The chemistry for SIBs has been investigated since the 1980s, but it went through a slow research and development process. Recently, there has been an acceleration in technology maturation due to a supply chain crisis originating from unequal resource distribution and sustainability and safety concerns regarding lithium-ion batteries. However, the practical application of SIBs has been hindered primarily by challenges related to cathode materials, specifically, surface and structural stabilities in different conditions. Through the integration of advanced techniques such as in situ spectroscopy, operando diffraction, and high-resolution microscopy, a comprehensive understanding of the cathode's dynamic behavior and degradation mechanisms can be achieved. The identified structural modifications, phase transitions, and degradation pathways offer critical insights into the design of robust cathode materials with prolonged cycling stability, fast charging capability, high energy density, great low-temperature performance, and safety. This review underscores the pivotal role of cutting-edge characterization techniques in guiding the development of high-performance sodium-ion batteries, thereby fostering the realization of sustainable and efficient energy storage solutions for diverse technological applications.

TI Novel zero-valent Co-Fe encapsulated in nitrogen-doped porous carbon
   nanocomposites derived from CoFe2O4@ZIF-67 for
   boosting 4-chlorophenol removal via coupling peroxymonosulfate
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Environment-friendly treatment process relies on the robustness, durability, and performance of catalysts to drive the development of cutting-edge sustainable technologies for the elimination of refractory contaminants. Herein, nanocomposites prepared from zero-valent Co-Fe encapsulated in nitrogencontaining carbon (N-C) nanoparticles (CFNC-30 NPs) derived from CoFe2O4@zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 were successfully prepared through pyrolysis integrated with self-reduction, and further utilized as the novel catalysts to degrade 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) by coupling with peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Three optimized parameters (CFNC-30 NPs dosage of 0.089 g L-1, PMS concentration of 1.1 g L-1, and initial pH of 6.6) were obtained via response surface methodology by using the BoxBehnken design model. Benefiting from the larger specific surface area, pore-volume, and existence of abundant hydroxyl groups, CFNC-30 NPs with more available active sites exhibited an excellent efficiency of 99.1% toward catalytic degradation of 4-CP within 30 min under the optimal conditions. Moreover, CFNC-30 NPs demonstrated durability and long-term stability even during the five consecutive cycle tests without a significant drop in its catalytic performance. The scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance technologies revealed that non-radical singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot), and hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) were involved as active species in the CFNC-30/PMS system, contributing 46.8, 35.6, and 17.6% efficiency toward 4-CP degradation, respectively. Besides, the reaction mechanism on the CFNC-30 NPs and degradation pathways toward 4-CP were speculated under PMS activation. The results indicated that the synergistic effects between zero-valent Co-Fe and N-C structures not only significantly boosted the removal efficiency and long-term stability of CFNC-30 NPs, but also facilitated the redox cycles of Co3+/Co2+ and Fe3+/Fe2+. This proof-of-concept approach to develop such high-efficient zero-valent Co-Fe encapsulated in N-C structures opens up novel avenues for wastewater decontamination via PMS activation.

TI A string of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanocubes coaxially grown on a
   CNT@bipolar conducting polymer as a high-performance cathode material
   for sodium-ion batteries
SO NANOSCALE
AB The development of suitable cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries is the key issue to realize their large-scale applications owing to the lack of appropriate materials with adequate electrochemical capacity and reversibility for Na-ion insertion reaction. Here, a string of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) nanocubes is coaxially grown on a CNT@bipolar conducting polymer (BCP) by a facile electrochemical route, and used as a high-performance cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. The obtained cathode shows a surprisingly high specific capacity of 194 mA h g(-1) upon the initial discharge, a good cycling performance and excellent rate performance. It is considered that the unique nanostructure not only effectively facilitates the electrode/electrolyte interaction and the electronic and ionic transportation but also exerts a synergistic effect between the BCP and NiHCF nanocubes to trigger the kinetics of the electron and ion transport. It is expected that such a promising environmentally friendly alternative cathode material can be widely applied for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).

TI Decontamination of very dilute Cs in seawater by a
   coagulation-precipitation method using a nanoparticle slurry of copper
   hexacyanoferrate
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB We examined the highly selective Cs adsorption ability of a potassium copper hexacyanoferrate (KCuHCF) slurry ink in seawater, i.e. very low Cs concentration in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Cl- ions at high concentrations. The rational synthesis of the KCuHCF nanoparticle (KCuHCF-NPs, A(y)Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](1-x)center dot zH(2)O) slurry ink was carried out using a Y-type micro-mixer and the composition dependence of the Cs-adsorption behavior was investigated. When a solution-to-adsorbent ratio of 10 000 mL g(-1) was applied, batch experiments revealed that the Cs adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 10 min, with removal efficiency reaching as high as 99% of the Cs present (initial concentration is 10 mu g L-1) and a distribution coefficient (K-d) as high as 10(6), even in the presence of competing alkali metal cations in seawater at high concentrations. For practical use, large flocs of the KCuHCF-NPs could be immediately coagulated after Cs adsorption using a high molecular-weight ionic polymer as a coagulant, along with regular Fe2+ inorganic flocculants at the pH of seawater.

TI Study of distorted octahedral structure in 3d transition metal complexes
   using XAFS
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Distortion in octahedral structure of 3d transition metal complexes (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) has been studied using XAFS showing divergent nature of Cu complex. EXAFS analysis showed elongated metal-oxygen bonds for Cu complex leading to more distorted structure. Derivative XANES spectrum at Cu K-edge exhibits splitting of main edge which is correlated to elongated Cu-O bond length. Using these coordination geometry around metal centers, theoretical XANES spectra have been generated and features observed have been correlated to the corresponding metals p-DOS. It has been shown that distorted octahedral field in Cu complex is responsible for splitting of p-DOS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Characterisation and modelling of potassium-ion batteries
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are emerging as a promising alternative technology to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their significantly reduced dependency on critical minerals. KIBs may also present an opportunity for superior fast-charging compared to LIBs, with significantly faster K-ion electrolyte transport properties already demonstrated. In the absence of a viable K-ion electrolyte, a full-cell KIB rate model in commercial cell formats is required to determine the fast-charging potential for KIBs. However, a thorough and accurate characterisation of the critical electrode material properties determining rate performance-the solid state diffusivity and exchange current density-has not yet been conducted for the leading KIB electrode materials. Here, we accurately characterise the effective solid state diffusivities and exchange current densities of the graphite negative electrode and potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate K2Mn[Fe(CN)6]\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{\rm{K}}}}}_{2}{{{\rm{Mn}}}}[{{{\rm{Fe}}}}{({{{\rm{CN}}}})}_{6}]$$\end{document} (KMF) positive electrode, through a combination of optimised material design and state-of-the-art analysis. Finally, we present a Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of a KIB full cell with realistic geometry and loadings, identifying the critical materials properties that limit their rate capability.
   Potassium-ion batteries are a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Here, authors characterise the solid-state diffusivities and exchange current densities of leading negative and positive electrode materials, enabling full-cell modelling to identify the properties limiting rate capability.

TI Dynamic magnetic properties of a mixed ferro-ferrimagnetic ternary alloy
   in the form of ABpC1-p with
   single-ion anisotropy
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We investigate the dynamic magnetic properties of the AB(p)C(1-p) form mixed ferro-ferrimagnetic ternary alloy. For this purpose, the system was simulated by means of a Hamiltonian including single-ion anisotropy, A and B sites interact ferromagnetically, and A and C sites interact antiferromagnetically in the presence of a time-dependent magnetic field. A ion contains S-A = 3/2, B ions have S-B = 1 and C ions have S-C = 5/2. The phase diagrams are calculated in temperature, single-ion anisotropy, and concentration ratio parameters planes. It is found that in our dynamic system, the critical temperature was always dependent on the concentration of the ternary alloy. We show that single-ion anisotropy can be used as a control parameter like concentration to arrange the critical temperature of the ternary alloy. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Advances on layered transition-metal oxides for sodium-ion batteries: a
   mini review
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB The energy storage mechanism and manufacturing equipment of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are similar. However, SIBs offer several advantages, such as low cost, abundant resources, environmental friendliness, and high safety. Consequently, they have garnered significant attention. SIBs are poised to be potential replacements for LIBs and represent ideal candidates in the field of large-scale energy storage. Layered transition-metal oxides (TMOs) are considered highly promising cathode materials due to their high average voltage, high specific capacity, and ease of synthesis. This paper provides a review of recent advances in layered TMOs for SIBs, including NaxCoO2, NaxMnO2, NaxFeO2, and their derivatives. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects in the development of layered TMOs are also discussed. It is hoped that this review will assist in the design and preparation of SIBs with superior electrochemical performance and further facilitate their practical application.

TI Surface-active MnFeO@C cubes as enhanced peroxymonosulfate activators
   for efficient degradation of bisphenol A
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Developing highly-effective catalysts through a facile method for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade recalcitrant pollutants is highly desirable. In this work, porous carbon-coated iron-manganese oxides (MnFeO@C) was facilely synthesized. The porous carbon film on the surface of MnFeO@C was beneficial to adsorption of bisphenol A (BPA) and flow of electrons. The catalytic degradation performance toward BPA was significantly improved with the increase of surface roughness and porosity of MnFeO@C after calcination. In particular, MnFeO@C derived at 300 degrees C (MnFeO@C-300) exhibited the highest degradation rate benefiting from the existence of Mn2O3. More than 95% BPA could be removed in 30 min by MnFeO@C-300/PMS system and remained efficient in a wide pH range from 3.0 to 10.0, especially in alkaline conditions. The intermediates of BPA degradation were identified and the degradation pathways involved hydroxyl oxidation and benzene ring opening were proposed based on GC-MS results. The removal rate of BPA can maintain more than 80% following five cycles. Thus, the as-prepared MnFeO@C-300 composites are available to serve as efficient and eco-friendly catalysts for advanced catalytic oxidation of recalcitrant pollutants.

TI Long-Cycle-Life Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries toward
   Large-Scale Energy Storage Systems
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The development of large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) aimed at application in renewable electricity sources and in smart grids is expected to address energy shortage and environmental issues. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) exhibit remarkable potential for large-scale ESSs because of the high richness and accessibility of sodium reserves. Using low-cost and abundant elements in cathodes with long cycling stability is preferable for lowering expenses on cathodes. Many investigated cathodes for SIBs are dogged by structural and morphology changes, unstable interphases between the cathode and the electrolyte, and air sensitivity, causing unsatisfactory cycling performance. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of capacity degeneration in depth and developing precise solutions are critical for designing low-cost cathodes that are highly stable under cycling. Herein, recent progress in long-cycle-life and low-cost cathodes for SIBs is focused on, and a comprehensive discussion of the key points in SIBs toward large-scale applications is provided. The roots of the unstable cycling performance of low-cost cathodes are discussed. Also, effective strategies are summarized from the recent progress on long-cycle-life and low-cost cathodes. This review is expected to encourage deeper investigation of long-lifespan cathodes for SIBs, particularly for potential large-scale industrialization.

TI Tunable and enhanced microwave absorption properties by adjusting the
   distribution of Co/CoFe embedded into the carbon nanohorns and graphene
   microspheres
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Designing unique structures of magnetic particle/carbon composites with multiple heterogeneous inter-faces is an effective strategy for improving the properties of microwave absorption. Herein, hierarchical spacing arrangements for Co@carbon nanohorns and Co@graphene microspheres (Co@CNHs/G) with N enrichment were synthesized by a simple self-assembly method. As a result, Co@CNHs/G exhibited ex-cellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance, and its reflection loss (RL) values of - 44.72 dB and - 41.39 dB at the C band had thicknesses of 2.9 mm and 2.5 mm, respectively. Additionally, the maximum effective absorption bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) was 5.7 GHz at 1.4 mm. More importantly, the distribution of metal nanoparticles into CNHs and graphene microspheres were adjusted by forming the CoFe alloy em-bedded into CNHs and graphene microspheres during arc discharge process. Consequently, the frequency of RL <= -40.00 dB was from the C band to the X band by changing the multiple scattering paths, and the corresponding thickness for the minimum RL (-40.00 dB) was 1.8 mm. The outstanding electromagnetic absorbing performance was mainly attributed to the enhanced dielectric loss involving interfacial polar-ization derived from multiple heterogeneous interfaces, dipolar polarization induced by N-doping, and defects in the CNHs and graphene. In addition, multiple complex scattering paths can further improve the attenuation of electromagnetic waves. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Circular utilization of Co(II) adsorbed composites for efficient organic
   pollutants degradation by transforming into Co/N-doped carbonaceous
   catalyst
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Resource recovery and environmental remediation serve to meet the scientific and technical challenges of cost-effective and sustainable strategy, especially for circular utilization of valuable metal and treatment of various wastewater (toxic metal ions, organics, etc.). Encouragingly, the research on circular utilization of recovered valuable metals in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for pollutants degradation is currently in blank; herein, a multistage utilization process for preparing Co/N-doped carbonaceous catalyst is plausibly proposed for the first time. Namely, by using a cheap and abundant alginate as a self-generating 3D network precursor, the interior/exterior modified aerogel beads (denoted as Ca-Me/ SA@0.75PEI) are fabricated via a simple sol-gel assembly for toxic metals removal or valuable metals recovery, following that Co2+ adsorbed composite (denoted as Ca-Me/SA@0.75PEI-Co) are converted into Co/N-doped carbonaceous catalyst (denoted as Ca-NC@0.75PEI-Co-700) by carbonization. Increased surface chelating sites and polarity with abundant functional components (N 15.68%) bring strong affinity to metal ions via ion-exchange, complexation and electrostatic interactions. Detailed isotherms, kinetics and dynamic studies illuminate the high adsorption capacity (698.62 mg/g), fast adsorption rate and long-term operation stability of Ca-Me/SA@0.75PEI adsorbent toward Co2+, respectively. Of particular interest of is that, the catalyst evolved from Co2+ adsorbed composite exhibits relatively-superior catalytic ability towards utilizing PMS oxidant to degrade organic pollutants. Animatingly, the simulation of real water system makes it potential for the multistage utilization of composites in actual industrial wastewater treatment. The coupling of watermelon-like structure and Co/N co-doping endows the adsorptive catalyst sustainable utilization capacity in heterogeneous catalysis based on the concept of "utilizing waste treating waste" circular economy, avoiding the problem of insufficient stability of ion adsorbed aerogel catalyst in PMS homogeneous catalysis.

AB Current performances of Li-, Na-, or K-ion batteries are mainly limited by the specific capacity of the positive electrode. Therefore, it is important to reach the highest capacity possible for a given electrode material. Here, we investigate the performance limitation of KVPO4F, a prospective material for K-ion batteries, which can deliver only 80% of its theoretical capacity. We discover that the capacity limitation of KVPO4F is related to a kinetic competition between K+ deinsertion and side reactions ascribed to the electrolyte degradation at high potentials. Homeotypic VPO4F can be obtained from KVPO4F through a chemical deintercalation process, which disproves a possible structural limitation or instability. The deintercalated compound was characterized by electron and X-ray diffraction, Xray absorption spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Despite the structural stability, a spontaneous reaction occurs between the deintercalated KxVPO4F (x < 0.5) and the electrolyte (0.8 M KPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethylene carbonate), with an electron transfer to vanadium compensated by K+ intercalation. This reaction leads to self-discharge until the open circuit potential is lower than 4.7 V versus K+/K, corresponding to the K0.5VPO4F composition.

TI An insight into the bridging role of Co3O4 in
   MOF-derived binary metal oxide modified sheet-like
   g-C3N4 for photo-assisted peroxymonosulfate
   activation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO
AB The utilization of carbon nitride (g-C3N4) inevitably faces structural defects and inadequacy in photocatalytic performance. Recently, metal-organic framework (MOF) derivative doping has emerged as a way to functionally alter catalysts. Herein, we synthesize a MOF-derived binary metal oxide (ZnO/Co3O4/C)-modified sheet-like g-C3N4 (ZCC-SCN) catalyst via a hydrothermal process combined with a co-pyrolysis method and apply it in a photo-assisted peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation system. The pyrolytic derivatization process endows ZCC-SCN with more porosity and larger surface area to favor the interfacial adsorption and reactivity of substrates. We validate a distinct ternary heterojunction composed of Co3O4-g-C3N4 and ZnO-Co3O4 in MOF derivatives. More notably, the enhanced Co-III/Co-II cycling further supports the bridging role of Co3O4 in the synergistic photo-assisted PMS activation system. Finally, SO4- coupled with the more generated O-2(-) dominates together to drive the rapid degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride. Our work provides a new perspective on the MOF derivative modification to carbon-based materials and is meaningful for the investigation of photo-assisted PMS activation.

TI Exploring negative thermal expansion materials with bulk framework
   structures and their relevant scaling relationships through multi-step
   machine learning
SO MATERIALS HORIZONS
AB Discovering new negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials is a great challenge in experiment. Meanwhile, the machine learning (ML) method can be another approach to explore NTE materials using the existing material databases. Herein, we adopt the multi-step ML method with efficient data augmentation and cross-validation to identify around 1000 materials, including oxides, fluorides, and cyanides, with bulk framework structures as new potential NTE candidate materials from ICSD and other databases. Their corresponding coefficients of negative thermal expansion (CNTE) and temperature ranges are also well predicted. Among them, about 57 materials are predicted to have an NTE probability of 100%. Some predicted NTE materials were tested by the first-principles calculations with quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), which indicates that the ML results are in good agreement with the first principles calculation results. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the existing and predicted NTE materials, we established three universal relationships of CNTE with an average electronegativity, porosity, and temperature range. From these, we also identified some important critical values characterizing the NTE property, which can serve as an important criterion for designing new NTE materials.
   We uses the multi-step ML method to mine 1000 potential NTE materials from ICSD, MPD and COD databases, and the presented phase diagram can serve as a preliminary criterion for judging and designing new NTE materials.

TI Electrospun nanofiber of cobalt titanate perovskite as an enhanced
   heterogeneous catalyst for activating peroxymonosulfate in water
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB As perovskite-type metal oxides are attractive catalysts for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), cobalt titanate (CoTiO3 (CTO)) is particularly promising as CTO consists of earth-abundant Ti and Co is the most effective metal for PMS activation. However, conventional preparation methods of CTO result in large CTO aggregates, leading to very low surface area and porosity, and also limiting its performance. In the present study, an electrospinning technique is employed to prepare CTO nanoscale fiber (CTONF), which can exhibit a consistent nanoscale fibrous morphology, enabling CTO to exhibit a relatively large surface area and porosity, as well as mesoporous structures. Thus, CTONF shows a higher catalytic activity than the bulk CTO for activating PMS to degrade a model toxicant, Amaranth (AR) dye. The PMS activation behaviors are further investigated by examining the effects of temperature, pH, and NaCl on AR degradation by CTONF-activated PMS (CTONF-PMS). Through the effects of probe reagents, the AR degradation mechanism can be attributed primarily to sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals to a lesser extent. CTONF was also proven to activate PMS over multiple cycles without regeneration. These results reveal that CTONF is a high effective and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for PMS activation as it outperforms the conventional bulk CTO. The findings obtained in this study also demonstrate that the electrospinning technique can be utilized to prepare perovskites with enhanced physical and chemical properties for catalytic advanced oxidation applications.

TI Hydrated Intercalation for High-Performance Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are steadily gaining attention based on their attractive merits regarding cost and safety. However, there are many obstacles to overcome, especially in terms of finding suitable cathode materials and elucidating their reaction mechanisms. Here, a mixed-valence vanadium oxide, V6O13, that functions as a stable cathode material in mildly acidic aqueous electrolytes is reported. Paired with a zinc metal anode, this material exhibits performance metrics of 360 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), 92% capacity retention after 2000 cycles, and 145 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 24.0 A g(-1). A combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations suggests that hydrated intercalation, where water molecules are cointercalated with Zn ions upon discharge, accounts for the aforementioned electrochemical performance. This intercalation mechanism facilitates Zn ion diffusion throughout the host lattice and electrode-electrolyte interface via electrostatic shielding and concurrent structural stabilization. Through a correlation of experimental data and theoretical calculations, the promise of utilizing hydrated intercalation as a means to achieve high-performance AZIBs is demonstrated.

The network has cyanido bridges to connect the Fe-II and Nb-IV sites and dpds as an additional ligand to crosslink the Fe-II sites. [Fe-II(dpds)(2)](2)[Nb-IV(CN)(8)]<middle dot>6H(2)O exhibits a gradual and incomplete spin crossover in which 22% of the high-spin Fe-II sites change to low-spin Fe-II sites as the temperature decreases. The calculation indicates that the spin transition occurs sparsely, rather than forming low spin site domains.

TI Peroxymonosulfate activation over NiCo2O4/MnOOH for enhancing
   Ciprofloxacin degradation in water
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB In this study, the catalyst NiCo2O4/MnOOH was effectively synthesized by coating MnOOH nanorods with 1, 5, 10, and 20% NiCo2O4 to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and enhance the catalytic performance in breaking down the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP). The result demonstrated that the 20% NiCo2O4/MnOOH + PMS system had the highest performance of CIP degradation. The CIP (20 mu M) was degraded by 97.8% during 30-min reaction at 100 mg L-1 of 20% NiCo2O4/MnOOH, and 200 mu M PMS. The observed kinetic rate constants of prepared catalysts with PMS were in the order: 20% NiCo2O4/MnOOH (1.78 x10-1 min-1) > 10% NiCo2O4/MnOOH (1.19 x10-1 min-1) > 5% NiCo2O4/MnOOH (0.91 x10-1 min-1) > 1% NiCo2O4/MnOOH (0.38 x10-1 min-1) > MnOOH (0.27 x10-1 min-1). Different operating parameters (solution pH, PMS con-centration, catalyst amount, organic matter, and inorganic ions) were investigated to determine their impact on the degradation of CIP. Durability and reusability of catalyst for CIP degradation were examined. In addition, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and scavenger test revealed the existence of sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-), hydroxyl radical (center dot OH), superoxide radical (O2 center dot-), and singlet oxygen (1O2) that were involved in the degradation of CIP under NiCo2O4/MnOOH + PMS system.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

SO INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB We report a three-dimensional molecule-based magnet, [Mn-3(II)(4-pyridone)(6)][W-v(CN)(8)](2)center dot 2H(2)O. This compound was synthesized in one-pot by evaporation of an aqueous solution in which MnCl2 center dot 4H(2)O, 4-hydroxypyridine and Cs-3[W(CN)(8)]center dot 2H(2)O were dissolved. The evaporation process causes self-assembly of the building blocks, forming a three-dimensional network structure with unique trimanganese units of [Mn-3(4-pyridone)(6)](6+) bridged by [W(CN)(8)](3-) anions. This compound has two types of short intermetallic bridges, which can exhibit two magnetic interaction pathways (Mn-II-O-Mn-II and Mn-II-NC-W-v). The magnetic interactions between W-v (S = 1/2) and Mn-II (S = 5/2) and between Mn-II and Mn-II are antiferromagnetic with exchange coupling constants of J(MnW) = - 3.9 cm(-1) and J(MnMn) = - 5.9 cm(-1), respectively.

AB Magnetic and magnetocaloric properties, as well as the phase diagrams of a ferromagnetic ternary alloy system have been studied. A detailed comparison of two different methods, namely the effective field theory (EFT), and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations has been provided. Our numerical data show that the general qualitative picture presented by two methods are in a good agreement with each other. In terms of the magnetocaloric properties, our results yield that it is possible to design magnetic materials with a variety of working temperatures and magnetocaloric properties (such as large Delta S-M and q values) by manipulating the magnetic phase transition via tuning the compositional factor (i.e. the mixing ratio of sublattice ions). The observed magnetocaloric effect has been found to be a direct one with Delta S-M < 0 associated with a second order phase transition.

TI Transition Metal Hexacyanoferrate(II) Complexes as Catalysts in the
   Ring-Opening Copolymerization of CO2 and Propylene Oxide
SO TOPICS IN CATALYSIS
AB The catalytic activity of four transition metal hexacyanoferrate(II) complexes (Ni-2[Fe(CN)(6)], Co-2[Fe(CN)(6)], KFe[Fe(CN)(6)] and Zn-2[Fe(CN)(6)]) in the ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of CO2 and propylene oxide (PO) is reported here for the first time and compared with that of other hexacyanometallate compounds. Complexes were prepared by coprecipitation employing tert-butanol as complexing agent. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and N-2 physisorption were used to confirm the identity of the obtained materials. Except for Zn-2[Fe(CN)(6)], which showed an amorphous nature, the complexes were constituted by aggregates of cubic nanocrystals with intra-crystalline micropores and inter-crystalline mesopores. Gas-solid phase titration with NH3 revealed the high potential of hexacyanoferrates as Lewis acid catalysts. In the case of Zn-2[Fe(CN)(6)], the lack of structural organization led to an extremely high density of acid sites (43 mu mol m(-2)). The resulting copolymers were analyzed via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. The studied transition metal hexacyanoferrate(II) catalysts showed mild activity in the target reaction, giving rise to polyethercarbonates with moderate CO2 content (9.3-18.1 wt%), random configuration (67.0-92.4% of polyethercarbonate linkages), modest molecular weights (M-W, g mol(-1) = 3400-20,200) and high dispersity (D-M = 4.0-5.4). Cyclic propylene carbonate (PC) was also produced (1.4-19.8 wt%). Among all, the Co-2[Fe(CN)(6)] complex stands as a potential catalyst for CO2/PO ROCOP due to its high CO2 uptake, selectivity and molecular weight of the obtained copolymer.

TI Single Laser Shot Photoinduced Phase Transition of Rubidium Manganese
   Hexacyanoferrate Investigated by X-ray Diffraction
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB We have studied by X-ray diffraction the phase transition of microcrystals of rubidium manganese hexacyanoferrate, for which combined electron transfer and structural reorganization are responsible for a change of magnetic properties. The Rb0.94Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.98)center dot 2.5H(2)O system undergoes a phase transition between the tetragonal phase Fe-II(S = 0)-CN-Mn-III(S = 2) and the cubic Fe-III(S = 1/2)-CN-Mn-II(S = 5/2) phases. The thermal equilibrium phase transition shows a broad regime of bistability, responsible for the appearance of a thermal hysteresis in the approximate 185-300 K temperature range. We used a deposited film to study by X-ray diffraction the switching from the tetragonal phase to the cubic phase, induced inside the thermal hysteresis by a single laser shot of tuneable power. Compared to previous measurements using local probes, our results show that the ns laser pulse induces a stable long-range ordered cubic phase when conversion is partial or complete.

AB One of the most important challenges of modern science and technology is the quest for novel and tuneable materials, the properties of which can be widely controlled by chemical modifications or external stimuli. Simultaneously, an interest in the development of magnetic thin films also gains significant attention. In the current paper we bring together both these challenges and present a study of a new type of low-dimensional nickel hexacyanoferrate/chromate system. Thin films were obtained by the "layer by layer" deposition technique, where the ratio of Fe/Cr was controlled by the dipping sequence.

TI Three 1D cyanide-bridged M( Ni, Pd, Pt)-Mn(II) Coordination Polymer:
   Synthesis, Crystal Structure and Magnetic Properties
SO ACTA CHIMICA SLOVENICA
AB Three tetracyanide-containing building blocks K-2[M(CN)(4)] (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) and one semi-closed macrocycle seven-coordinated manganese(II) compound have been employed to assemble cyanide-bridged heterometallic complexes, resulting in three cyanide-bridged M-II-Mn-II complexes: [Mn(L)][Ni(CN)(4)] center dot 2H(2)O (1) [Mn(L)][Pd(CN)(4)] (2) and [Mn(L)][Pt(CN)(4)] (3) (L = 2,6-bis[1-(2-(N-methylamino) ethylimino) ethyl] pyridine). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows their similar one-dimensional structure consisting of the alternating [Mn(L)](2+) species and [M(CN)(4)](2-) building blocks, generating a cyanide-bridged neutral polymeric chain. In all three isostructural complexes the coordination geometry of manganese ion is a slightly distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal with the two cyanide nitrogen atoms at the trans positions and N5 coordinating mode at the equatorial plane from ligand L. Investigation over magnetic properties of these complexes reveals very weak antiferromagnetic interaction between neighboring Mn(II) ions bridged by the long NC-M-CN unit. A best-fit to the magnetic susceptibility of complexes 1-3 leads to the magnetic coupling constant of J = -0.081, -0.103 and -0.14 cm(-1), respectively.

TI Ni-doped cobalt hexacyanoferrate microcubes as battery-type electrodes
   for aqueous electrolyte-based electrochemical supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Ni-doped cobalt hexacyanoferrate (NiCoHCF) microcubes were fabricated through co-precipitation method at room temperature. The doping of nickel ions shows positive effect on the nanostructure and electrochemical properties of the cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF). The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) indicate that the doping of nickel ions can reduce the grain size of CoHCF microcubes. The as-synthesized NiCoHCF microcubes are studied as electrode materials for supercapacitor showing a high specific capacitance of 129.4 mAh g(-1) (466 F g(-1)) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) and good cycling stability of retaining 87.9% after 2000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4 under 0-1 V at 2 A g(-1) when the molar ratio of nickel-cobalt is 1:2 mmol. The enhanced electrochemical performance of NiCoHCF benefits from the strong synergistic utilization of nickel ions and cobalt ions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Electronic density distribution of Mn-N bonds by a tuning effect through
   partial replacement of Mn by Co or Ni in a sodium-rich hexacyanoferrate
   and its influence on the stability as a cathode for Na-ion batteries
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB This study evaluates the effect of equimolar substitution of manganese by cobalt or nickel in hexacyanoferrate (HCF) open frameworks as electrode materials for Na-ion batteries. As the stability of Mn-N bonds is crucial to obtain long term stability and cyclability of manganese (Mn-HCF), the samples were analyzed thoroughly using several spectroscopic and structural methods. The XPS and infrared experiments reveal that the charge density around Fe is modulated by the presence of Co or Ni, which is associated with their high polarizing power, leading to decreased cell distortion as revealed by XRD. The Rietveld refinement demonstrated that the octahedra built by 3d metals and the cyanide nitrogen were distorted with the axial bond distances being larger than the equatorial distances. This octahedral distortion promotes the spin behavior of 3/2 for Mn2+ confirmed by magnetic experiments; the arising of this spin state is attributed to d orbital splitting determined by UV-Vis experiments. Therefore, the changes upon Mn substitution are related to the modification of the covalent character of Mn-N bonds, modulated by the effect of the Ni and Co polarizing power. All these properties improve the electrochemical stability of the Ni or Co substituted materials as Na-ion batteries, leading to higher capacity retention even at higher C-rates (5C) and good capacity recovery, in comparison with those obtained for Mn-HCF.

TI "Nanoregion" effect of ionic liquid mixture system for preparing highly
   active porous electrocatalytic hydrogen production materials
SO FUEL
AB The development of porous electrocatalytic materials with high activity and large specific surface area is the key to realizing efficient hydrogen production by water electrolysis. In this paper, a universial strategy for preparing porous non-precious metal electrocatalysts with high effective surface area is provided based on the "nano- region" formed by ionic liquid mixture system, and the feasibility is verified by constructing a porous NiCo@NC based electrocatalyst. The microstructure, surface composition, specific surface area and electrochemical properties of the porous electrocatalyst are investigated systematically. Compared with the traditional hydrothermal synthesis, the "nanoregion" effect can give the NiCo@NC electrocatalyst rich pore structure and good hydrophilicity, thus effectively improve the effective surface area available for the electrochemical reaction. As a result, the overpotential for HER on NiCo@NC-500 prepared in the ionic liquid mixing system is 113 mV lower than that on NiCo@NC-500-w prepared by common hydrothermal process, and the Tafel slope decreases by 37 mV dec(-1) (33.9 %), further verifying the effectiveness of this simple and green strategy to develop porous non-precious metal electrocatalysts for hydrogen production by the "nanoregion" effect of ionic liquid mixture system.

TI Electrocatalysis of Methanol Oxidation in Alkaline Electrolytes over
   Novel Amorphous Fe/Ni Biphosphate Material Prepared by Different
   Techniques
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this work, novel phosphate materials based on bimetallic character (Fe and Ni) were introduced by different chemical fabrication methods, the reflux method (FeNiP-R) and the sol-gel technique (FeNiP-S), and evaluated as non-precious electrodes for methanol electrooxidation in KOH electrolytes. The designed FeNiP-R and FeNiP-S samples were investigated using different characterization techniques, namely TEM, SEM, XPS, BET, DLS, and FT-IR, to describe the impact of the fabrication technique on the chemistry, morphology, and surface area. The characterization techniques indicate the successful fabrication of nanoscale-sized particles with higher agglomeration by the sol-gel technique compared with the reflux strategy. After that, the electrochemical efficiency of the fabricated FeNiP-R and FeNiP-S as electrodes for electrocatalytic methanol oxidation was studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different methanol concentrations and scan rates in addition to impedance analysis and chronoamperometric techniques. From electrochemical analyses, a sharp improvement in the obtained current values was observed in both electrodes, FeNiP-R and FeNiP-S. During the MeOH electrooxidation over FeNiP-S, the current value was improved from 0.14 mA/cm(2) at 0.402 V to 2.67 mA/cm(2) at 0.619 V, which is around 109 times the current density value (0.0243 mA/cm(2) at 0.62 V) found in the absence of MeOH. The designed FeNiP-R electrode showed an improved electrocatalytic character compared with FeNiP-S at different methanol concentrations up to 80 mmol/L. The enhancement of the anodic current density and charge transfer resistance indicates the methanol electrooxidation over the designed bimetallic Fe/Ni-phosphates.

TI Cobalt-lignosulfonate complex derived non-noble catalysts: Facile
   valorization for high-performance redox conversion of organic pollutants
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB A versatile and scalable preparation of hierarchically porous and highly active catalysts from a ligno-sulfonate biopolymer was proposed. The materials were systematically evaluated for catalytic oxidation of metformin, sulfamethoxazole, and phenol and reductive hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol and 1-nitronaphthalene as model pharmaceutical and industrial pollutants. Temperature, background matrix, substrate, catalyst and chemical loading govern the conversion rates differently. Complete phenol and sulfamethoxazole removals were achieved in 90 min at very low dosage of Oxone (R) (0.325 mM) and catalyst (0.05 g/L) while mineralizing more than 80% (phenol and sulfamethoxazole) and 36% (metformin). Humic acid, gallic acid, sodium azide, chloride and bicarbonate ions at environmentally relevant levels possessed minor inhibitory effects on sulfamethoxazole degradation. Results from EPR spin-trapping, radical quenching, and D2O exchange experiments support a dual-mode activation mechanism of Oxone (R). In the catalytic reduction of the nitro compounds, excellent turnover frequencies of up to 3.75 x 10(-2)/min for 4-nitrophenol and 2.04 x 10(-3)/min for 4-nitronaphthalene were attained, outperforming the capacity of many previously reported catalysts. Furthermore, various solvent exchange studies reveal the significant role of structured surficial moieties in a "water assisted" catalytic mechanism and reduction pathway. The N, S co-doped samples exhibited superior performance, synergistically attributable to the active heteroatoms and Co-N-x/S-y-C clusters on porous sp(2)-conjugated framework. For both processes, the catalysts maintained their magnetic responsiveness, high activity and stability profile for at least five cycles, highlighting the practical applicability of this benign valorization route and the envisaged straightforward heterogeneous applications.

TI Sulfate Radical-Based Degradation of Organic Pollutants: A Review on
   Application of Metal-Organic Frameworks as Catalysts
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The degradation of organic pollutants present in domestic and industrial effluents is a matter of concern because of their high persistence and ecotoxicity. Recently, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are being emphasized for organic pollutant removal from effluents, as they have shown higher degradation efficiencies when compared to conventional activated sludge processes. Sulfate radical-based methods are some of the AOPs, mainly carried out using persulfate (PS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which have gained attention due to the ease of sulfate radical generation and the effective degradation of organic molecules. PMS is gaining more popularity because of its high reactivity and ability to generate excess sulfate radicals. PMS has been the major focus; therefore, its mechanism has been explained, and limitations have been elaborated. The involvement of metal-organic frameworks for PMS/PS activation applied to organic pollutant removal and recent advances in the application of biochar and hydrogel-assisted metal-organic frameworks have been discussed.

TI Humidity-A Powerful Tool to Customize the Physical Properties of
   Molecular Magnets
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Since the dawn of the century, people have been fascinated by the mysterious force that draws two pieces of lodestone (magnetite, Fe3O4) to each other as well as by property of stilbite (natural zeolite, NaCa4[Si27Al9O72] center dot 28 H2O) to generate huge amounts of steam by rapidly heating the material. Nowadays, we know the first effect is addressed by magnetic attraction whereas the second one is related to the reversible sorption/desorption of water from humid air inside porous materials. For a long time, it was thought that these two, at first glance, were disjunctive properties that cannot be combined into one material. Nevertheless, the scientists have once again proved that there are no impossible things. Based on the discovery of the first molecular magnets, the idea to combine magnetic properties with other functionalities such as porosity gained great consideration by scientists from different research fields. Very soon, we witnessed numerous reports of novel multifunctional materials among which we can distinguish humidity-responsive magnets. In this manuscript, the most outstanding results for such systems working at normal temperature and pressure (NTP) will be presented to motivate in-depth research on this topic.

TI Enhanced lifespan and rate capability of cobalt hexacyanoferrate in
   aqueous Na-ion batteries owing to particle size reduction
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) suffers from low rate capability and lifespan because of the dissolution and structural instability of Co during cycling. A smaller active material can relieve the stress caused by volume change during cycling and enable shorter transport pathways. Here, particle size reduction is performed by reducing the mixing time or citrate concentration in the coprecipitation reaction to improve the rate capability and lifespan of CoHCF. The reduced mixing time produces smaller particles with enlarged active sites, thus improving the capacity. Upon coprecipitation at a low citrate concentration, particle precipitation at reduced sizes is achieved by preferential nucleation versus growth. Although lowering the citrate concentration enlarges the external surface area, the reduced redox-active Fe degrades the capacity. All CoHCF samples with small sizes achieved enhance rate capability and stability. In particular, the sample synthesized with a short mixing time (0 h) achieve a specific capacity of 122 mAh g-1 with improved rate capability (79.4%) and stability (79.3%) over 500 cycles. Structural distortions are relaxed because of the shortened transport pathways and relieved distortion owing to particle size reduction. This study paves the approach for fast rechargeable and long-lasting aqueous Na-ion batteries using CoHCF electrodes.

TI Activation of peroxymonosulfate by metal-organic frameworks derived
   Co1+xFe2-xO4 for organic dyes
   degradation: A new insight into the synergy effect of Co and Fe
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived CoFe2O4 is regarded as a promising catalyst in pollutants control due to its good performance for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. However, the study towards organic dyes degradation is rare and the mechanism of the synergy effect of Co and Fe is not clarified. Herein, the MOFs derived M-Co1+xFe2-xO4 with more Co(III) in octahedral sites was prepared and used to degrade organic dyes by activating PMS. Under optimized conditions, the Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation kinetics rate of MCo1+xFe2-xO4 is 0.260 min(-1), which is 20 times higher than the commercial Co3O4 (0.013 min(-1)). SO4 center dot- plays the vital role in RhB degradation and the contribution of Co(III) in octahedral sites is greater than that of Fe for PMS activation. Under weak acidic condition (pH 5), the effect of surface adsorbed OH- on PMS activation is negligible meanwhile the valence conversion of Fe is absent, implying the mechanism of synergy effect of Co and Fe under such condition is different from what was previously reported. This work would shed lights on understanding the origin of the activity of CoFe2O4 in PMS activation and developing PMS-based technologies for organic dyes wastewater treatment.

   Zn/K1.6Mn1.2Fe(CN)6 batteries with zero
   capacity loss in extremely long working duration
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have attracted intensive attention in large grid energy storage owing to the low cost and high safety, but are impeded by the lack of suitable cathode materials with both long-cycle and working time. To overcome the barrier, we construct a rechargeable non-aqueous zinc-ion battery comprising a new MnHCF cathode, non-aqueous Zn2+-containing electrolyte, and zinc anode. The in-situ XRD analyses reveal a reversible cubic-monoclinic phase transformation mechanism during cycling. The Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple within a stable crystal framework ensures a high operation voltage of 1.6 V and a specific capacity of 65.5 mA h g(-1). Up to 94% capacity retention is maintained after 8500 cycles at 200 mA g(-1), beyond most reported non-aqueous ZIBs. Remarkably, the Zn/MnHCF batteries show nearly zero capacity loss in an extremely long working duration (over 6180 h) even after a break of one month, suggesting the excellent storage stability and potential applications.

TI Near-infrared-photoinduced metamagnet based on a layered cyanido-bridged
   Co-W assembly with π-π interactions
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB A newly synthesized photomagnet based on a cyanido-bridged Co-W assembly, [{Co(isoquinoline)4}3{W(CN)8}2]center dot 2EtOH (CoWisoq), exhibits a controllable photoinduced (PI) phase with a metamagnetic behavior. The PI phase shows a transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic with a coercive field of 550 Oe at 2 K. It has a monoclinic (P21/n) crystal structure and is comprised of two-dimensional cyanido-bridged Co-W coordination layers with two crystallographically independent Co sites (Co1, Co2) and one W site. Both Co sites adopt a pseudo-octahedral six-coordinated geometry involving four isoquinoline and two cyanide ligands. pi-pi interactions are induced at half of the isoquinoline ligands in Co1 and all of those in Co2 sites, suggesting that the coordination environment at the Co1 site has structural flexibility. CoWisoq displays a thermal phase transition around 140 K with a small thermal hysteresis due to the charge transfer-induced spin transition between CoII-WV of the high temperature (HT) phase and CoIII-WIV of the low temperature (LT) phase. This charge transfer, which is also responsible for a drastic color change between purple (HT) and yellow (LT), involves only the structurally flexible Co1 sites. The ligand field, which is composed of four isoquinoline and two cyanide ligands, contributes to a unique metal-to-metal charge transfer absorption band of the LT phase at 1025 nm. Irradiation of the LT phase with near-infrared light produces a PI phase with the CoII-WV state.
   A cyanido-bridged Co-W assembly with pi-pi interactions showed a thermal phase transition and a photo-induced metamagnetism based on a charge transfer-induced spin transition.

TI Functional polymers-assisted confined pyrolysis strategy to transform
   MOF into hierarchical Co/N-doped carbon for peroxymonosulfate advanced
   oxidation processes
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Environmentally friendly MOFs derived carbon-based catalysts with reasonable porous structure and composi-tion have exhibited distinguished effect on persulfate advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Here, functional polymers including dopamine (PDA) and phenolic resin (RF) assisted confined pyrolysis strategy was raised to prepare MOFs derived hierarchical Co/N-doped carbon. Functional polymers shell endowed catalysts with some advantages: (i) achieved confined pyrolysis function; (ii) achieved heteroatomic doping; (iii) phenolic resin protected ZIF-67 from being PDA etching. To better understand the connection between composition and structure, different polymer dosage (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 g) and pyrolysis temperature (700-1000 degrees C) were employed. According to the findings, 0.4-PAC-8 had a higher degradation efficiency (k = 0.295 min-1) for the model contaminant tetracycline (TTCH) than the other materials with the largest specific surface area (403 m2/ g), adequate hierarchical porous structure, and ideal composition. Degradation mechanism used to be tested by way of EPR and quenching experiments, and the degradation pathways have been verified through 3D-EEM and LC-MS. Degradation products toxicity of simulation and test indicated that MOFs derived carbon-based catalysts were reliable in environmental remediation.

TI Facile synthesis of CoxFe1-xP microcubes derived
   from metal-organic frameworks for efficient oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The electrochemical splitting of water provides an attractive method for the production of hydrogen fuels. Unfortunately, the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution (OER) on the anode side of the electrolyzer hinders the efficient and large-scale hydrogen production. In this study, starting from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a series of bimetal phosphides CoxFe1-xP (x = 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 0.75 and 0.80) were synthesized by low-temperature phosphidiation of corresponding MOFs precursors. The as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Studies indicate that the proportion of cobalt and iron elements make a big differences on the structure of the materials. Benefiting from the porous structure and large specific area of the MOFs precursors, as well as the synergistic effect between Co and Fe elements, the as-synthesized Co0.66Fe0.33P shows superior electrocatalytic performances and outstanding stability toward OER in alkaline solution.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We report a spin crossover material based on a cyanido-bridged Fe-II-Mo-IV assembly, Fe-2(II)[Mo-IV(CN)(8)](1-(3-pyridyl)ethanol)(8).4H(2)O. This compound has a cubic crystal structure in the
   I a
   3 <mml:mo stretchy="false"><overbar></mml:mover> d space group and is composed of a three-dimensional cyanido-bridged Fe-II-Mo-IV coordination network with one crystallographic Fe-II site. It exhibits incomplete spin crossover, because 21% of the high-spin Fe-II sites (S=2) changes to low-spin Fe-II sites (S=0) in the temperature range between 200 and 50K. Thermal hysteresis is not observed. Such an incomplete and gradual spin crossover is attributed to the elastic frustration between the high-spin and the low-spin Fe-II sites (e.g., alternating arrangement such as -HS-LS-HS-LS-).

AB The pentacyanidonitrosylmetalate [M(CN)(5)(NO)] (M = metal ion) is an attractive building block for bimetal assemblies exhibiting a long-range magnetic ordering. In this work, a cyanido-bridged bimetal assembly based on a pentacyanidonitrosylmolybdate, Cs1.26Mn0.87[Mo(CN)(5)(NO)]0.6H(2)O, was prepared. This compound has a noncentrosymmetric cubic crystal structure in the F43m space group and a lattice constant of 10.8970(3) angstrom. It exhibits ferrimagnetism with a Curie temperature (T-C) of 65 K due to the antiparallel ordering of the Mn-II (S = 5/2) and Mo-I (S = 1/2) magnetic spins. Owing to the piezoelectric crystal structure, this compound exhibits second harmonic generation (SHG) and magnetization-induced second harmonic generation (MSHG).

TI Cathode Materials for Potassium-Ion Batteries: Current Status and
   Perspective
SO ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have recently attracted considerable attention in electrochemical energy storage applications due to abundant and widely distributed potassium resources and encouraging intercalation chemistries with graphite, the commercial anode of lithium-ion batteries. One main challenge in PIBs, however, is to develop suitable cathode materials to accommodate the large size of K+ ions with reasonable capacity, voltage, kinetics, cycle life, cost, etc. In this review, recent advancements of cathode materials for PIBs are reviewed, covering various fundamental aspects of PIBs, and various cathode materials in terms of synthesis, structure, and electrochemical performance, such as capacity, working potential, and K-storage mechanisms. Furthermore, strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of cathode materials through increasing crystallinity, using buffering and conducting matrixes, designing nanostructures, optimizing electrolytes, and selecting binders are summarized and discussed. Finally, challenges and prospects of these materials are provided to guide future development of cathode materials in PIBs. Graphical Abstract

   [Co2Fe2] Complex into Supramolecular
   Hydrogen-Bonded Networks
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB A stimuli-responsive tetranuclear complex was assembled into new aggregates with controllable dimensionality through directional hydrogen bonds (HBs). A cyanide-bridged tetranuclear complex cation, [Co2Fe2(CN)(6)(tp*)(2)(bpy*)(4)](2+) (abbreviated to 1(2+)) (tp*= hydrotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl) borate and bpy*= 4,4'-dimethyl- 2,2'-bipyridine) has two terminal cyanide nitrogens and acts as a hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) with a linear bridging mode. Co-crystallization of 1(2+) with p-hydroquinone (H(2)Q), a hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) with two donor sites, led to a one-dimensional aggregate, 1(BPh4)(2) center dot (H(2)Q) center dot 2H(2)O (2), while a two-dimensional sheet with a honeycomb structure, 1(3)(PF6)(6) center dot (H(3)PG)(2) center dot 4CH(3)CN center dot 8H(2)O (3), was obtained by co-crystallization with phloroglucinol (H(3)PG) acting as a three-way structure-directing HBD. Magnetic measurements revealed that 2 and 3 exhibited thermal and light-induced electron-transfer-coupled spin transitions (ETCSTs).

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The rapid development of industry in recent years has led to the introduction of serious pollutants into water bodies, and there is an urgent need for efficient organic degradation technologies. At present, selective peroxynitrite (PS) oxidation (SR-AOPs) is an effective way to treat pollutants in water bodies, and it is necessary to select a suitable material for the activation of peroxynitrite. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their tunable structure, large specific surface area, and tunable ligand molecules exhibit excellent reactivity and catalytic performance in the activation of persulfate. With MOF-based materials for PS activation as a novel advanced oxidation technology, this study reviews MOFs and their composites and derived materials. The current research status of activated persulfate for the treatment of organic pollutants in water, the influence of different systems on the degradation performance are discussed, and the activation and degradation mechanisms are discussed; the problems of the above materials in the degradation of organic pollutants are summarized, and research directions based on the coupled activated persulfate system of MOF materials are proposed.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB It is very important to design and prepare low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts for water splitting in alkaline solution. In this study, Ni-Fe-P and Ni-Fe-P-FeMnO3 electrocatalysts are developed using a facile electrodeposition method. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization studies show that FeMnO3 particles are successfully composited into the Ni-Fe-P amorphous matrix, and multi-stage nanostructures are obtained which enable the exposure of more active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The Ni-Fe-P electrocatalyst prepared at a deposition current density of 150 mA cm(-2) exhibits remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activity, and only requires 39.7 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Compared with the Ni-Fe-P electrode, the Ni-Fe-P-FeMnO3 electrode shows more outstanding electrocatalytic properties requiring only 13.5 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The fabricated Ni-Fe-P-FeMnO3 electrode is able to sustain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with negligible increase in overpotential in 24 h which shows remarkable electrochemical stability.

TI From rational design of a new bimetallic MOF family with tunable linkers
   to OER catalysts
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Innovative bimetallic MOFs offer more possibilities to further tailor the properties of MOFs, which have attracted great attention for wide applications. However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic MOFs due to the lack of a tunable and reasonable hybrid structure architecture. Herein, a new series of bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable pillar linkers were prepared by a one-step synthesis method. These bimetallic MOFs retain the same crystal structure when the mole fraction (based on metal) of the two metals changes from 0 to 1 and both metal ions occupy random nodal positions. The incorporation of a second metal cation has a large influence on the intrinsic properties (e.g. thermal stabilities and band gaps) of the MOFs. Furthermore, these bimetallic MOFs were used as self-sacrificial templates to prepare bimetal oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After pyrolysis, a porous and hierarchical honeycomb-like structure with carbon network covered (bi)metal oxides is formed. Among all the bimetallic MOF-derived catalysts, CoNi1@C showed the best performance for the OER with the lowest Tafel slopes (55.6 mV dec(-1)) and overpotentials (335 mV on a glassy carbon electrode and 276 mV on Ni foam) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is higher than those of state-of-the-art Co-Ni mixed oxide catalysts derived from MOFs for the OER. Our results indicate that the incorporation of a second metal ion is a promising strategy to tailor the properties of MOFs. More importantly, this new bimetallic MOF family with tunable linkers is expected to serve as a flexible assembly platform to offer broad possibilities for practical applications of MOFs.

TI MOFs-derived porous nanomaterials for gas sensing
SO POLYHEDRON
AB Developments of the industry lead to the emission of gaseous pollutants. Emissions management systems need real-time feedback, which can be proved by gas sensors, to control the emission. The key factor to gas sensors is gas-sensing material with high sensing performance. Metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) stand for a class of porous material which is combined by organic linkers and metal ions with strong bonds. MOFs can possess large pore volume, high surface area and excellent chemical stability, by careful selection of constituents. Researches on syntheses, structures and properties of MOFs have indicated that they are promising materials for various types of gas sensors. In addition to direct use, MOFs also have been used as sacrificial templates/precursors for preparation of various functional gas-sensing nanomaterials, which showed high gas-sensing response, stable repeatability and so on. In this review, we aim to present the recent development of MOFs-derived nanomaterials applied in gas sensors. Examples of MOFs-derived nanomaterials in the gas sensing of acetone, ethanol, benzene, toluene, xylene, formaldehyde and hydrogen sulfide are then detailed. Finally, an outlook in terms of future challenges is also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The cyanometallic framework (CMF)-derived bimetallic oxide/graphene foam (GF) composites were synthesized by a solution immersion and subsequent annealing treatment. As a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors, the Co3O4-NiO/GF electrode exhibited remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high specific capacity (766 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), superior rate capability with 67% capacitance retention (0.5-10 A g(-1)), as well as excellent cycling stability (86% retention after 5000 cycles). The improved capacitance performances were ascribed to the strong synergistic interaction between hierarchical Co3O4-NiO and GF substrate, where metal oxides contributed to high pseudocapacitance and GF provided outstanding conductivity and structural stability of electrodes.

TI Metal-organic framework derived hollow polyhedron
   CuCo2O4 functionalized porous graphene for

SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB A hollow CuCo2O4 polyhedron/porous reduced graphene oxide (PrGO) composite was prepared by simple thermolysis-induced transformation of heterobimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks/porous graphene oxide (Cu-Co-ZIFs/PGO). In this strategy, the PGO was suitable for Cu-Co-ZIFs growing and anchoring, and the framework acted as sacrificial template during the formation of morphology-inherited hollow polyhedrons. In the obtained composite, PrGO sheets not only provided conduction path, but also served as protective agent to prevent the aggregation of crystals. The hollow rhombic dodecahedral CuCo2O4 possessed plentiful active sites and high electrocatalytic activity. When the composite was optimized and used for glucose sensing, it displayed good performance with a wide linear range of 0.5-3354 mu M, a low detection limit of 0.15 mu M (s/N=3), a high sensitivity of 2426 mu AmM-1 cm(-2) and short response time (<3 s). Moreover, it could resist the interference of coexistent substances from serum sample etc. Thus the composite modified glassy carbon electrode was a promising enzyme-free glucose sensor.

TI Utilization of core-shell nanoparticles to evaluate subsurface
   contribution to water oxidation catalysis of
   [Co<SUP>II</SUP>(H2O)2]1.5[Co<SUP>III</
   SUP>(CN)6] nanoparticles
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Nanoparticles of a cyano-bridged polynuclear metal complex, [Co-II(H2O)(2)](1.5)[Co-III(CN)(6)], have been reported as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for photocatalytic water oxidation, however, reasons for the high catalytic activity have yet to be clarified. Herein, the water oxidation catalysis was investigated for a series of core-shell nanoparticles composed of cyano-bridged polynuclear metal complexes employing [Co-I(I)(H2O)(2)](1.5)[Co-III(CN)(6)] as the shell to assess subsurface contribution. The catalytic activity of the core-shell nanoparticles closely related to that of the core parts suggests that the subsurface contributes to the nanoparticle catalysis. Then, catalysis of the core-shell nanoparticles employing [Co-II(H2O)(2)](1.5)[Co-III(CN)(6)] as the catalytically inactive core but isostructural to [Co-II(H2O)(2)](1.5)[Co-III(CN)(6)] was examined to determine the thickness directly involved in the catalytic reaction. The catalytic activity depending on the thickness of the [Co-II(H2O)(2)](1.5[)Co-III(CN)(6)] shell suggests the involvement of Co-II ions at the subsurface up to 7 nm. These results suggest that the microporous structure of [Co-II(H2O)(2)](1.5)[Co-III(CN)(6)] enlarged by intrinsic defects is a reason for the high catalytic activity, where the photosensitizer and water molecules utilize the subsurface Co-II ions as active sites.

TI In Situ Ligand Transformation for Two-Step Spin Crossover in
   Fe<SUP>II</SUP>[M<SUP>IV</SUP>(CN)8]<SUP>4-</SUP> (M = Mo,
   Nb) Cyanido-Bridged Frameworks
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB We report a unique synthetic route toward the multistep spin crossover (SCO) effect induced by utilizing the partial ligand transformation during the crystallization process, which leads to the incorporation of three different Fe-II complexes into a single coordination framework. The 3-acetoxypyridine (3-OAcpy) molecules were introduced to the self-assembled Fe-II-[M-IV(CN)(8)](4-) (M = Mo, Nb) system in the aqueous solution which results in the partial hydrolysis of the ligand into 3-hydroxypyridine (3-OHpy). It gives two novel isostructural three-dimensional {Fe-2(II)(3-OAcpy)(5)(3-OH-py)(3)[M-IV(CN)(8)]}center dot nH2O (M = Mo, n = 0, FeMo; M = Nb, n = 1, FeNb) coordination frameworks. They exhibit an unprecedented cyanido-bridged skeleton composed of {Fe3M2}(n) coordination nanotubes bonded by additional Fe complexes. These frameworks contain three types of Fe sites differing in the attached organic ligands, [Fe1(3-OAcpy)(4)(mu-NC)(2)], [Fe2(3-OHpy)(4)(mu-NC)(2)], and [Fe3(3-OAcpy)(3)(3- OHpy)(mu-NC)(2)], which lead to the thermal two-step Fe-II SCO, as proven by X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, UV- vis-NIR optical absorption, and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy studies. The first step of SCO, going from room temperature to the 150-170 K range with transition temperatures of 245(5) and 283(5) K for FeMo and FeNb, respectively, is related to Fel sites, while the second step, occurring at the 50-140 K range with transition temperatures of 70(5) and 80(5) K for FeMo and FeNb, respectively, is related to Fe2 sites. The Fe3 site with both 3-OAcpy and 3-OHpy ligands does not undergo the SCO at all. The observed two-step SCO phenomenon is explained by the differences in the ligand field strength of the Fe complexes and the role of their alignment in the coordination framework. The simultaneous application of two related pyridine derivatives is the efficient synthetic route for the multistep Fe-II SCO in the cyanido-bridged framework which is a promising step toward rational design of advanced spin transition molecular switches.

TI Sparkling Synergy: Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution with a Mesoporous
   CoP/FeP Interface
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The reaction kinetics is predominantly determined by the surface and interface engineering of electrocatalysts. Herein, we demonstrate the growth of cobalt monophosphide and iron monophosphide (CoP/FeP) with an effective solid interface. The surface of CoP/FeP is mesoporous, which is obtained by phosphidizing mesoporous CoFe2O4. The CoP/FeP electrode exhibits substantially superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance compared to CoP and FeP. The overpotentials (eta) required to generate 10 mA cm(-2) are determined to be around 98 mV(RHE) (CoP/FeP), 220 mV(RHE) (FeP), and 265 mV(RHE) (CoP) in an acidic electrolyte. The exchange current density and Tafel slopes suggest that CoP/FeP has better redox properties and kinetic abilities compared to FeP and CoP. Furthermore, the CoP/FeP electrode exhibits reduced electrochemical impedance and superior surface charge transport characteristics in comparison to both the CoP and FeP electrodes. In addition to having a greater number of catalytically active sites, the turnover frequency of CoP/FeP is approximately 2 and 5 times higher than that of FeP and CoP, respectively. The CoP/FeP electrode maintains a consistent current density of around 25 mA cm(-2) for a continuous period of 24 h during the HER, attesting to the excellent durability of the CoP/FeP electrode. In addition, a relationship between differential hydrogen adsorption energy (Delta E-H), the corresponding Gibbs free energy change (Delta G(H)), and the hydrogen coverage on distinct surfaces, namely, CoP, FeP, and CoP/FeP, is established. The calculation findings show that the CoP/FeP surface, which is predominantly exposed with CoP, exhibits the highest catalytic potential for the HER. The estimation of the specific HER activity of the electrodes, normalized to the electrochemically active surface area, corroborates the calculation findings.

TI 4-Bromopyridine-Induced Chirality in Magnetic
   M<SUP>II</SUP>-[Nb<SUP>IV</SUP>(CN)8]<SUP>4-</SUP> (M = Zn,
   Mn, Ni) Coordination Networks
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB The introduction of 4-bromopyridine (4-Brpy) to a self-assembled M-II-[Nb-IV(CN)(8)] (M = 3d metal ion) coordination system results in the formation of three-dimensional cyanido-bridged networks, {[M-II(4-Brpy)(4)](2)[Nb-IV(CN)(8)]}center dot nH(2)O (M = Zn, n = 1, 1; M = Mn, n = 0.5, 2; M = Ni, n = 2, 3). All these compounds are coordination frameworks composed of octahedral [M-II(4-Brpy)(4)(mu-NC)(2)] complexes bonded to square antiprismatic [Nb-IV(CN)(8)](4-) ions bearing four bridging and four terminal cyanides. 1 and 2 crystallize in the chiral 14(1)22 space group as the mixture of two enantiomorphic forms, named 1(+)/1() and 2(+)/2(-), respectively. The chirality is here induced by the spatial arrangement of nonchiral but sterically expanded 4-Brpy ligands positioned around M-II centers in the distorted square geometry, which gives two distinguishable types of coordination helices, A and B, along a 4-fold screw axis. The (+) forms contain left handed helices A, and right handed helices B, while the opposite helicity is presented in the (-) enantiomers. On the contrary, 3 crystallizes in the nonchiral Fddd space group and creates only one type of helix. Half of them are right handed, and the second half are left handed, which originates from the ideally symmetrical arrangement of 4-Brpy around Nill and results in the overall nonchiral character of the network. 1 is a paramagnet due to paramagnetic N-IV centers separated by diamagnetic Zn-II. 2 is a ferrimagnet below a critical temperature, T, of 28 K, which is due to the CN--mediated antiferromagnetic coupling within Mn NC Nb linkages. 3 reveals a ferromagnetic type of Ni-II-Nb-IV interaction leading to a ferromagnetic ordering below T, of 16 K, and a hysteresis loop with a coercive field of 1400 Oe at 2 K. Thus, 1 is a chiral paramagnet, 3 is a nonchiral ferromagnet, and 2 combines both of these functionalities, being a rare example of a chiral molecule-based magnet whose chirality is induced by the noninnocent 4-Brpy ligands.

TI Building responsive materials by assembling
   {Fe4Co4} switchable molecular cubes
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Responsive materials that can answer to chemical or physical external stimuli offer numerous prospects in material science. Here, we have elaborated a two-step synthetic approach that allows incorporating molecular cubic switches into a polymeric material. Firstly, a preformed half-capped, Cs+-templated {Fe4Co4} cyanido-polymetallic cubic unit ("pro-cube") is obtained and proven to be stable in solution, as demonstrated by paramagnetic NMR. Secondly, the reaction of the pro-cube with a ditopic scorpionate ligand enables the precipitation of a polymeric network containing the cubic unit. Furthermore, the adequately chosen ditopic ligand that coordinates the Co ions of the pro-cube allows us to preserve the switchable properties of the cubic unit. Indeed, the magnetic properties of the polymeric material compare well with those of the molecular cubic model that is obtained by reacting a non-bridging scorpionate ligand, and that was prepared as a reference. Both the polymeric material and the molecular model cube show a thermally-induced metal-metal electron transfer near room temperature. Interestingly, the magnetic state of the polymeric material is shown to depend on its hydration state, indicating its capability to act as a chemo-sensor.

TI Coordination polymer-derived cobalt-embedded and N/S-doped carbon
   nanosheet with a hexagonal core-shell nanostructure as an efficient
   catalyst for activation of oxone in water
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB As sulfate-radical (SR)-based advanced oxidation processes are increasingly implemented, Oxone has been frequently-used for generation of SR. While Co3O4 nanoparticle (NP) has been widely-accepted as a promising catalyst for activating Oxone, Co3O4 NPs tend to aggregate in water, losing their reactivity. Thus, many attempts have immobilized Co3O4 NPs on supports, especially carbonaceous substrates, because combination of Co NPs with carbon substrates offers synergistic effects for boosting catalytic activities. Moreover, carbon substrates doped with hetero-atoms (N and S) further increase electron transfer and reactivity. Therefore, it is even promising to immobilize Co NPs onto N/S-doped carbon (NSC) to form Co-embedded NSC (denoted as CoNSC) for enhancing Oxone activation. In this study, a convenient and facile technique is proposed to prepare such a CoNSC via a simple carbonization treatment of a coordination polymer of Co and trithiocyanuric acid (TTCA). The resulting CoNSC exhibits the sheet-like hexagonal morphology with the core-shell configuration, and Co NPs are well-embedded into the N/Sdoped carbonaceous matrix, making it an advantageous heterogeneous catalyst for Oxone activation. As Azorubine S (ARS) decolorization is employed as a model reaction of Oxone activation, CoNSC exhibits a higher catalytic activity than pristine Co3O4 and NSC for Oxone activation to decolorize ARS. In comparison to the other reported catalysts, CoNSC also possesses a much lower E-a for ARS decolorization. CoNSC can be also reusable and stable for Oxone activation over multiple cycles without loss of catalytic activity. These features validate that CoNSC is a promising and useful Co-based catalyst for Oxone activation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI An Aqueous Ca-Ion Battery
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Multivalent-ion batteries are emerging as low-cost, high energy density, and safe alternatives to Li-ion batteries but are challenged by slow cation diffusion in electrode materials due to the high polarization strength of Mg- and Al-ions. In contrast, Ca-ion has a low polarization strength similar to that of Li-ion, therefore a Ca-ion battery will share the advantages while avoiding the kinetics issues related to multivalent batteries. However, there is no battery known that utilizes the Ca-ion chemistry due to the limited success in Ca-ion storage materials. Here, a safe and low-cost aqueous Ca-ion battery based on a highly reversible polyimide anode and a high-potential open framework copper hexacyanoferrate cathode is demonstrated. The prototype cell shows a stable capacity and high efficiency at both high and low current rates, with an 88% capacity retention and an average 99% coloumbic efficiency after cycling at 10C for 1000 cycles. The Ca-ion storage mechanism for both electrodes as well as the origin of the fast kinetics have been investigated. Additional comparison with a Mg-ion cell with identical electrodes reveals clear kinetics advantages for the Ca-ion system, which is explained by the smaller ionic radii and more facile desolvation of hydrated Ca-ions.

X-ray single-crystal study of complex 3 revealed that its crystal structure is ionic and is built up of mer-[Co(dien)2](3+) complex cations, scarce [Fe-II(CN)(5)(CNH)](3-) complex anions with one protonated cyanide group and water molecules of crystallization. The thermal properties (TG and DTA) on air of all complexes were studied. The thermal decompositions of all studied complexes are stepwise starting with dehydration at 60 (1), 130 (2), 70 (3) and 55 degrees C (4). Further decomposition of the respective complexes involves (with possible overlapping of the respective processes) deamination and redox decomposition of the cyanido ligands yielding metals which upon further heating are re-oxidized. The solid residue for 1 was identified using powder X-ray diffraction, SEM and EDX methods as inverse spinel oxide.

TI Tunable electronic coupling of Fe-doped CoS2/reduced graphene
   oxide composites for boosting bifunctional water splitting activity
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The electrochemical water splitting process is always restrained for its sluggish kinetics and high reaction energy barrier. Therefore, developing outstanding bifunctional catalysts to enhance the reaction kinetics and electron transfer efficiency of water splitting is crucial. In this work, we reported a bifunctional nanohybrid electrocatalyst consisting of Fe-doped CoS2 nanocage-decorated reduced graphene oxide (FCSRGO) with superior water splitting activity. The Fe doping adjusts the density of state (DOS) to increase the conductivity and decreases the adsorption free energy of intermediates, contributing to optimized catalytic activity. Furthermore, the incorporation of RGO reduces the agglomeration of CoS2 and improves the conductivity, thereby amplifying the charge/species transfer efficiency. By optimizing the amount of RGO, FCSRGO shows exceptional electrocatalytic performance, achieving a benchmark current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) at remarkably low overpotentials (eta(10)) of 107 mV and 239 mV in 1 M KOH solution for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, the nanohybrid exhibits remarkable stability with the current density retention of 89.8% for HER and 85.8% for OER after 36000 s test. This work highlights the creating of high-performance electrocatalysts for efficient and sustainable hydrogen and oxygen evolution through heteroatom doping and carbon incorporation.

TI Effect of valence state of cobalt in cobalt hexacyanoferrate
   coprecipitated at different temperatures on electrochemical behavior

AB Cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoFe(CN)(6); CoHCF) is coprecipitated as a cathode material in an Na-ion aqueous battery with varying solution temperatures of 5 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 70 degrees C to tailor the particle size and defect content. At a low temperature, the small cubic particle is prepared with high Fe vacancies and low Na amounts. Conversely, an elevated temperature results in the enlarged particle with lower Fe vacancies and high Na amounts. Meanwhile, the lattice parameter is extended at a high temperature based on the Co2+ evolution with a larger ionic radius than that of the Co3+ ion at the Co site. Contrary with the expectations, a lower specific capacity is obtained for the highly crystalline structure at high temperature due to the evolution of the irreversible redox-inactive Co2+. The low temperature of 5 degrees C confers an excellent rate capability, capacity retention of 89% at 20 times faster charging rate, based on the smaller particles and relieved distortion in cycling. The shorter diffusion path for Na intercalation due to the fine powder enables a faster charging process. Higher Fe vacancies induced at lower temperature limit Na accommodation, yielding a reduced distortion. The coprecipitation at low temperature enhances the rate performance and cyclability, sacrificing the capacity.

TI Vanadium-Based Materials as Positive Electrode for Aqueous Zinc-Ion
   Batteries
SO ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS
AB With the increasing dependence on high power equipment, there is an urgent need to develop advanced and sustainable energy systems. As one of the main energy storage devices, battery research should make great efforts to implement the sustainable development strategies on ecological, clean and environmentally friendly energy. Currently, aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have gained much attention owing to their cheapness, abundant resources, high safety, and ecological friendliness. Nevertheless, ZIBs also have shortcomings with respect to the positive electrode. Therefore, the development of satisfactory positive electrode materials with structural stability and high capacity has become the focus of attention. In recent years, many vanadium-based compounds have been strongly upheld for their advantages of safety and high theoretical capacity. In this paper, different energy storage mechanisms of vanadium-based positive electrodes are summarized. Typical structures, such as layered and tunnel types, are particularly emphasized. Moreover, the comparison and analysis of electrochemical results of vanadium-based compounds, including vanadium oxide and metal vanadate are focused. Finally, the strategies for improving aqueous ZIBs and development prospects are also discussed.

TI Increasing the availability of active sites in Zn-Co double metal
   cyanides by dispersion onto a SiO2 support
SO JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB Zn-Co double metal cyanides (DMCs) were dispersed on silica by dry and liquid-assisted (LAG) grinding to improve the catalytic performance of the DMC phase. The characterization of the resulting materials by transmission electron microscopy, N-2 physisorption, and powder X-ray diffraction indicated that the presence of water during the grinding step, not only helped to preserve the structural and textural properties of the DMC, but also facilitated the dispersion of the active phase onto the silica support. The accessibility of the Lewis acid sites was increased, as evidenced by FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine as probe molecule. The catalytic activity of the DMC phase for both the hydroamination of phenylacetylene with 4-isopropylaniline and the ring opening polymerization of 1,2-epoxyhexane was enhanced upon dispersion on silica due to the greater availability of the active Zn(II) sites. As a result, higher turnover frequencies were obtained upon decreasing the amount of DMC in the sample. The positive effect on the catalytic activity was the most pronounced for the catalysts prepared via LAG. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Aqueous potassium-ion batteries (AKIBs) with mild aqueous electrolytes can significantly mitigate the safety and environmental issues raised from traditional nonaqueous batteries, positioning them as promising candidates for grid-scale applications. Nonetheless, the progression of AKIBs is currently impeded by the insufficient energy density, largely attributed to the limited voltage window of aqueous electrolytes. This review aims to introduce foundational knowledge about aqueous batteries, illustrates recent advancements in AKIBs, and offers valuable perspectives on designing electrode materials and optimizing electrolytes. To provide a systematic overview, the focus is on the following seven key sections: i) development history, ii) electrode materials, iii) electrolyte design, iv) current collectors, v) aqueous interphase chemistry, vi) full cell configurations, and vii) future prospects. Finally, constructive insights and suggestions are provided for the development of AKIBs with higher energy density.

TI Trace Alcohol Adsorption by Metal Hexacyanocobaltate Nanoparticles and
   the Adsorption Mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Adsorption of alkyl chain alcohols, ranging from methanol to n-hexanol, on manganese hexacyanocobaltate (MnHCCo) and copper hexacyanocobaltate (CuHCCo) nanoparticles was evaluated. The equilibrium adsorption capacity at low pressure was found to be larger than previously published results using other kinds of adsorbents, metal organic frameworks, zeolites, and activated carbons. For example, MnHCCo adsorbed 5 mmol/g of methanol at only 8.9 Pa, less than 1/10 of the lowest pressures used in previous studies. The adsorption can be understood using a two-step process: initial adsorption into the crystal (intra-nanoparticle adsorption) followed by that among the nanoparticles (inter-nanoparticle adsorption). The suggested mechanism was supported by the analysis of the adsorption isotherm with the dual-site Langmuir equation, and the entropy loss in the adsorption process. The highest adsorption amount at low pressure was caused by a combination of coordination bonding between alcohol molecules at the high-density open metal sites in the adsorbent and by the intermolecular interaction between the framework of the adsorbent and the alkyl chain of alcohols.

TI Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Nanoparticles as a Low Cost Cathode Material for
   Lithium-Ion Batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate KNi[Fe(CN)(6)] (NiHCF) was synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method and investigated as a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. The X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy studies revealed the formation of pure phase of agglomerated NiHCF nanoparticles of about 20-50 nm in size. The material exhibited stable cycling performance as a cathode in a lithium half-cell within a wide range of current densities, and a working potential around 3.3 V vs. Li+/Li. The lithium ion diffusion coefficient in this system was determined to be in a range of 10(-9) to 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1), which is within the values for the cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries with high rate capability. Considering promising electrochemical performance and attractive lithium-ion diffusion properties of this material along with its economical benefits and simplified preparation, NiHCF could be considered as a very promising cathode for large scale lithium-ion batteries.

TI Battery Electrode Materials with Omnivalent Cation Storage for Fast and
   Charge-Efficient Ion Removal of Asymmetric Capacitive Deionization
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) that engages porous carbon electrodes constitutes one of the well-established energy-efficient desalination methods. However, improvement in desalination performance, including ion removal capacity, ion removal rate, and charge efficiency remains requisite for a wide range of applications. Herein, an ion-exchange membrane-free asymmetric CDI is introduced by pairing a metal organic framework (MOF), namely, K0.03Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](0.65)center dot 0.43H(2)O and porous carbon. The exclusive intercalation of cations into the MOF prevents the reverse adsorption of co-ions (anions), thus significantly improving ion removal capacity (23.2 mg g(-1)) and charge efficiency (75.8%). Moreover, by utilizing the advantage of the MOF that diverse mono- and divalent cations can be stored in the narrow redox potential range, the asymmetric CDI allows simultaneous capture of mono- and divalent cations, thus achieving omnivalent cation removal. Moreover, cations are intercalated in the hydrated forms without a discrete phase transition of the host structure, facilitating rapid desalination by reducing the desolvation energy penalty, which results in a high ion removal rate of 0.24 mg g(-1) s(-1). This study offers a new design principle in CDI: the integration of a crystal structure with large ionic channels that enable hydrated intercalation of multivalent ions in a fast and exclusive manner.

TI Triple functionalization of carved N-doped carbon nanoboxes with
   synergistic trimetallic sulphide for high performance lithium-sulphur
   batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Lithium-sulphur batteries (LSBs) have been drawing rapidly increasing research attention because of the low cost and high theoretical capacity of sulphur. The applications of LSBs however are hampered by poor stability caused by the shuttle effects of lithium polysulphides (LiPS), poor conductivities of sulphur, and sluggish redox kinetics of LiPS. Here, an advantageous carved N-doped carbon nanobox structure triply functionalized with an FeCoNi trimetallic sulphide was developed as a high performance sulphur host for LSBs. The strong chemical interactions toward LiPS, half-metallic conductivities, and catalytic activities toward redox reactions of LiPS, enabled through functionalization with FeCoNi trimetallic sulphide, work together to resolve the critical issues of LSBs. Moreover, the carved N-doped carbon nanobox structure serves as a nanoreactor that helps retain LiPS at cathodes and offers a confined space for fast local redox reactions. The triply functionalized carved N-doped carbon nanoboxes (S-FeCoNi@C-CNB) lead to high performance LSBs, delivering a high capacity of 1238 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and maintaining a decent capacity of 655 mA h g(-1) at 2C. The LSB exhibits excellent stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle over 200 cycle operations at 1C, indicating the success of S-FeCoNi@C-CNB in suppressing the shuttle effect.

TI A Cation and Anion Dual Doping Strategy for the Elevation of Titanium
   Redox Potential for High-Power Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Titanium-based polyanions have been intensively investigated for sodium-ion batteries owing to their superior structural stability and thermal safety. However, their low working potential hindered further applications. Now, a cation and anion dual doping strategy is used to boost the redox potential of Ti-based cathodes of Na3Ti0.5V0.5(PO3)(3)N as a new cathode material for sodium ion batteries. Both the Ti3+/Ti4+ and V3+/V4+ redox couples are reversibly accessed, leading to two distinctive voltage platforms at ca. 3.3 V and ca. 3.8 V, respectively. The remarkably improved cycling stability (86.3 %, 3000 cycles) can be ascribed to the near-zero volume strain in this unusual cubic symmetry, which has been demonstrated by in situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction. First-principles calculations reveal its well-interconnected 3D Na diffusion pathways with low energy barriers, and the two-sodium-extracted intermediate NaTi0.5V0.5(PO3)(3)N is also a stable phase according to formation energy calculations.

TI Facile synthesis of Co3O4/Co@N-doped carbon
   nanotubes as anode with improved cycling stability for Li-ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Herein we report Co3O4/Co@N-doped carbon nanotubes (T-Co3O4/Co@NC) as an efficient and highly stable anode material for lithium-ion batteries. T-Co(3)o(4)/Co@NC is facilely prepared via the thermal decomposition of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) in N-2 and the oxidation in O-2. T-Co3O4/Co@NC exhibits a high degree of graphitization and a large specific surface area, thus promoting the conductivity and providing more active sites. More importantly, the proper existence of metallic Co makes the reaction more reversible and thus leading to the improved cycling stability. Specifically, T-Co3O4/Co@NC delivers a high specific capacity of 689.2 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) after 400 cycles with the capacity retention rate of 99.5%. In contrast, Co3O4/Co@N-doped carbon nanoball (B-Co3O4/Co@NC) exhibits a discharge specific capacity of only 247.0 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles, and the capacity retention rate is as low as 30.1%. Furthermore, TCo3O4/Co@NC also exhibits excellent cycling performance in a full cell, with the coulombic efficiency over 95%, capacity retention rate over 87% after 100 cycles. The improved stability is mainly attributed to the existence of metallic Co which helps to optimize the solid electrolyte interphase film and form carbon nanotubes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Ni-Fe nanocubes embedded with Pt nanoparticles for hydrogen and oxygen
   evolution reactions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Electrochemical water-splitting is widely regarded as one of the essential strategies to produce hydrogen energy, while Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials are used to prepare electrochemical catalysts because of its controllable morphology and low cost. Herein, a series of trimetallic porous Pt-inlaid Ni-Fe nanocubes (NCs) are developed with bifunctions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the process of prepare the electrochemical catalysts, Pt nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in the Fe-Ni PBA cube structure, and ascorbic acid is employed as a reducing agent to reduce Pt2+ to Pt nanoparticles. In this work, the cubic structure of Fe-Ni PBA is maintained and the noble metal Pt nanoparticles are embedded. Remarkably, the formation of PBA cubes, Pt inlay and reduction are completed in one step, and Pt nanoparticles are embedded by a simple method for the first time. By employing acid etching method, a porous structure is formed on the PBA cube, which increases the exposed area of the catalyst and provides more active sites for HER and OER. Due to the porous structure, highly electrochemical active surface area and the embedded of highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles, the porous 0.6 Ni-Fe-Pt nanocubes (NCs) exhibits excellently electrocatalytic performance and durable stability to HER and OER. In this work, for HER and OER, And Tafel slopes are 81 and 65 mV dec(-1), the overpotential n at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) are 463 and 333 mV, and the onset potential are 0.444 and 1.548 V, respectively. And after a 12-h i-t test and 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV), it maintained high stability and durability. This work opens up a new preparation method for noble metal embedded MOF materials and provided a new idea for the preparation of carbon nanocomposites based on MOF.

TI Carbon-coated cobalt iron bimetallic phosphide as a bifunctional
   electrocatalyst for overall water splitting
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Transition metal phosphides have been widely used in the design of water splitting electrodes because of their high catalytic activity. However, due to the different reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in different media, a major challenge is how to achieve the transition metal phosphides electrocatalysts afford high performance of both HER and OER in the same electrolyte. Herein, a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst with carbon-coated cobalt iron bimetallic phosphide (CoFeP@C/NF-2) was self-assembled on nickel foam by hydrothermal and phosphidation pathway. Benefiting from its unique flower-like structure, and the synergistic effect of bimetallic phosphides and carbon coated, which not only offered abundant catalytic active sites but also accelerated electronic transmission, the CoFeP@C/NF-2 could act a bifunctional electrocatalyst that was simultaneously used for OER and HER. The CoFeP@C/NF-2 hybrid deliv-ered a high OER catalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte, with a low overpotential of 119 and 217 mV at current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm-2, respectively. The CoFeP@C/NF-2 electrode also exhibited a considerable OER stability over 20 h. Meanwhile, when serving as a catalyst for the HER under alkaline condition, it showed an overpotential of 155 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the assembled electrolytic cell using CoFeP@C/NF-2 only required a voltage of 1.59 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the overall water splitting. This work provides a general strategy for improving the water splitting performance of phos-phides, which can be applied to the preparation of other transition metal catalysts.

TI Coprecipitation Temperature Effects of Morphology-Controlled Nickel
   Hexacyanoferrate on the Electrochemical Performance in Aqueous
   Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Coprecipitation effortlessly fabricated nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) with outstanding rate capability and stability for aqueous batteries. Citrate-aided coprecipitation decelerated the crystallization, assembling cubic-shaped powder based on separation between nucleation and growth. This study revealed that coprecipitation temperature determined the electrochemical performance. With lower temperatures, smaller particles with more water were formed by predominant nucleation, resulting in low crystallinity and capacity of 58 mAh g(-1). Expanded surface area reduced electrode/electrolyte interface charge-transfer resistance and showed excellent rate capability (79 % of initial capacity at 100 C-rate). However, poor cyclability was obtained. At elevated temperatures, nuclei growth and dehydration occurred, and thus highly crystalline large particles were formed. In turn, NiHCF delivered excellent capacity of 76 mAh g(-1) at 1 C-rate but exhibited inferior rate performance because of longer diffusional path. Meanwhile, normal coprecipitation at 70 degrees C induced irregular-shaped tiny particles, presenting 93 % retention of initial capacity at 100 C-rate.

TI The bismuth vanadate thin layers modified by cobalt hexacyanocobaltate
   as visible-light active photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water
   oxidation
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Bismuth vanadate thin films deposited using the pulsed laser deposition technique were modified using cobalt hexacyanocobaltate (Cohcc). The 2-step method of Cohcc nanocubes preparation was applied: i) metallic cobalt deposition and ii) cobalt electrooxidation in Co(CN)(6)(3-) containing electrolyte. The presence of CN stretching vibrations was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The energy band gap was equal to 2.5 eV and was estimated using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The presence of Cohcc did not clearly affect the absorbance ability of tested films. Electrodes were tested as photoanodes for water splitting. It was shown that electrocatalytical properties of Cohcc in the oxygen evolution reaction strongly affect the photocurrent generated during FTO/BiVO4/Cohcc illumination. A significant, almost 1 V, shift of the onset potential towards lower potential was achieved. The role of Cohcc has been discussed on the basis of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhanced stability and rate performance of zinc-doped cobalt
   hexacyanoferrate (CoZnHCF) by the limited crystal growth and reduced
   distortion
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) is a potential cathode for aqueous Na-ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity (170 mAh g(-1)); however, its lower rate capability and cyclability limit its applications. Structural distortion at a weak N-coordinated crystal field during cycling disintegrates Co, yielding an irreversible reaction. Different Zn amounts ranging 0-1 were added to the Co site to suppress the structural irreversibility of CoHCF, yielding Co1-xZnxHCF powder; this Zn (x <= 0.09) addition reduced the powder's dimension because the lower four coordination of Zn-N, not the six coordination of Co-N, limits the powder growth. Simultaneously, a small lattice parameter and interaxial angle (similar to 90 degrees) are obtained, implying that a narrower Co1-xZnxHCF inner structure is formed to accommodate Na ions. Moreover, the electronic conductivity of Co1-xZnxHCF gradually increased within 0-0.09 range. A smaller particle size with a high surface area leads to a near-surface-limited redox process, similar to a capacitive reaction. Both the surface-limited reaction and electronic conductivity enhances the reversibility due to the smaller charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface caused by Zn addition. Replacing redox-active Co with non-active Zn amount of 0.07 (Co0.93Zn0.07HCF) slightly reduces the specific capacity from 127 to 119 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) due to the shrunken Co charging sites. Rate performance is enhanced by compromising the capacity and reduced distortion, resulting in 81% retention at a 20 times-faster charging rate. Notably, the Co0.93Zn0.07HCF sample exhibited the good stability while preserving 74% of the initial capacity at 0.5 A g(-1) after 200 cycles.

TI The critical behaviors of a ferromagnetic-ferrimagnetic Ising ternary
   alloy with mixed spin-(1/2,3/2,5/2)
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB The ferromagnetic-ferrimagnetic ternary alloy described in the form of AB(p)C(1-p) consisting of spins S-i(A) = 1/2, S-j(B) = 3/2 and S-j(C) = 5/2 is studied in the framework of the mean field theory (MFT) based on the Bogoliubov inequality for the free energy. The model has a selective site disorder, i.e., S-i(A) can either have S-j(B) as the nearest neighbor with probability p or S-j(C) with 1 - p randomly. The ground-state phase diagrams are calculated on the (R = |JA(C|)/J(AB), d = D/zJ(AB)) planes to reveal various possible ground states of the system. The phase diagrams are mapped on the (R, kT(c)/J(AB)), (D/J(AB), kT(c)/J(AB)), (p, kT(c)/J(AB)) and (p, kT(comp)/J(AB)) planes for given values of p, R and D. It is shown that the model only displays second-order phase transition temperatures. The existence of single or double compensation temperatures is also evident for the appropriate values of our parameters. We have also confirmed the existence of multicompensation behavior for the total magnetization of the system via the application of Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations as predicted by the MFT approach. Our obtained results are compared to those reported in the literature and reliable agreements are found.

TI High-Rate and Long-Life Cycle of Nano-LiMn2O4
   Under High Cut-Off Potential
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY CONVERSION AND STORAGE
AB Nano-LiMn2O4 was successfully synthesized by a low-temperature hydrothermal route with the absence of post-calcination treatment. Employing ethanol as an organic reagent triggers the formation of nanostructured particles approximately 30.39 nm in diameter, associated with 0.007 lattice strain. The pure phase of nano-LiMn2O4/Li displays outstanding electrochemical performances. Under 4.6 V versus Li+/Li cut-off potential, 74.3% of capacity is reserved when C-rate is increased by 50 times, while excellent capacity restoration of 96.9% after cycled again at 1 C. After 331 cycles, a capacity retention of 84.3% is harvested by nano-LiMn2O4/Li, implying the absence of phase transformations in spinel structures under such abuse conditions. This remarkable structural stability can be attributed to the small lattice strain, associated with high Li+ diffusion coefficient, which is estimated to be 10(-9.76) cm(2) s(-1) by the EIS technique. Additionally, Li+ extraction is more favorable when nano-LiMn2O4/Li is charged up to 4.6 V versus Li+/Li, interpreted by the polarization resistance (R-p) of the cell.

TI Ultrafast Spintronics: Dynamics of the Photoisomerization-Induced
   Spin-Charge Excited-State (PISCES) Mechanism in Spirooxazine-Based
   Photomagnetic Materials
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The optical control of spin state is of interest in the development of spintronic materials for data processing and storage technologies. Photomagnetic effects at the single-molecule level have recently been observed in the thin film state at 300 K in photochromic cobalt dioxolenes. Visible light excitation leads to ring-closure of a photochromic spirooxazine bound to a cobalt dioxolene, which leads to generation of a high magnetization state. Formation of the photomagnetic state occurs through a photoisomerization-induced spin-charge excited-state process and is dictated by the spirooxazine ligand dynamics. Here, we report a mechanistic investigation by ultrafast spectroscopy in the UV-vis region of the photochemical ring-closing process in the parent spirooxazine, azahomoadamantylphenanthroline spirooxazine, and the photomagnetic spirooxazine cobalt-dioxolene complex. The cobalt appears to stabilize a photomerocycanine transient intermediate, presumably the TCC isomer, formed along the ground-state potential energy surface (PES). Structural changes associated with the TCC isomer induces formation of the high-spin Co(II) form, suggesting that magnetization dymanics can occur along the excited-state PES, leading to ultrafast switching on the ps time scale. We demonstrate the full ring closure of the spiro-oxazine ligand is not required to switch magnetization states which can be induced with a higher yielding isomerization reaction. The ability of this system to undergo optically induced spin state switching on the ps time scale in the solid state makes it a promising canididate for resistive nonvolatile memory technologies.

TI Moving toward high-energy rechargeable Mg batteries: Status and
   challenges
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have gained significant market share in the field of consumer electronics, grid storage, and hybrid electric vehicles, because of its exceptional energy densities per unit volume (area or weight) compared to other electrochemical energy storage systems. However, they do approach its maximum practical capacities and efforts are underway to explore future battery systems with enhanced energy density than LIBs. There has been growing interest in incorporating multivalent ions such as Zn2+, Mg2+, and Al3+, since they offer greater volumetric energy densities than its monovalent counterparts like LIBs and sodium-ion batteries. It has long been acknowledged that replacing lithium with magnesium (Mg) ions in battery systems has many potential benefits such as low cost, excellent rate capability, high energy density, ease of handling, and eco-friendly. Yet, a few breakthroughs has been made in the advancement of rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) since its first discovery in 2000. The success of RMBs has been hindered by the slow electrode kinetics and also the formation of passive layers on Mg metal surfaces seriously affecting its performance during Mg2+ ion magnesiation/demagnesiation. This chapter provides comprehensive knowledge on the background of rechargeable Mg batteries, principles, and cell configuration, discussing key advancements made in the last two decades in terms of its electrode materials and electrolytes. Finally, a brief note on future research strategies is outlined.

TI Ab initio investigation of layered MoS2 electrodes for aqueous zinc
   batteries via interlayer engineering
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Rechargeable zinc batteries with aqueous electrolytes have traditionally suffered from inferior electrochemical and kinetic performance due to poor accommodation of zinc within the electrodes. Engineered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), with their tunable interlayer spacings, are a promising class of materials for the electrodes to address these limitations, offering potential for fast atomic transport and effective intercalation. Here we investigate in detail the atomic scale mechanism of aqueous zinc intercalation in a prototypical layerexpanded TMD, MoS2. Using systematic first principles density functional theory simulations, we show that the presence of water molecules within bulk unmodified MoS2 decreases stability and diffusion kinetics of intercalated zinc. Optimisation of interlayer distances improves the kinetics in all cases. 1T-MoS2 retains a stable calculated voltage of 0.8 V, showing suitability as the anode material, while 2H-MoS2 has poor stability above zinc concentrations of 0.03 per MoS2 formula unit. 1T-MoS2 is thermodynamically favourable above zinc concentrations of 0.25 zinc per MoS2 formula unit at all engineered interlayer distances, with a specific capacity of 232 mAh g-1. The key findings of the study advance the understanding of the trade-off between electrochemical capacity and kinetics, thus highlighting an approach to improved anodic performance of MoS2 for aqueous zinc batteries.

TI Engineering mesoporous semiconducting metal oxides from metal-organic
   frameworks for gas sensing
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Chemiresistive gas sensors based on semiconducting metal oxides (SMOs) have been widely used in medical diagnosis, industrial production and aerospace vehicles. It's challenging to develop gas sensor with high selectivity and low working temperature. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived SMOs have been regarded as a promising candidate for developing high-performance gas sensors owing to their mesoporous structure, unique morphology, tunable architectures and compositions. Great progresses have been made in design and synthesis of SMOs with different nanostructures and compositions using MOFs as a precursor. However, there are few reviews to summarize the progresses of this fast-growing area. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent developments in the field of MOFs-derived mesoporous SMOs with different architectures and compositions for gas sensing application. In particularly, the influence of structure and composition of SMOs on the sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, response/recovery speed and working temperature are summarized. Strategies including constructing novel nanostructures, building heterojunctions, decorating with noble catalysts and combining with highly-conductive materials for enhancing the sensing performance are discussed in this review. Furthermore, the current challenges and prospects in the application of MOFs-derived mesoporous SMOs for sensing application are proposed. This review may provide a guideline for rational design and development of high-performance gas sensors using MOFs-derived SMOs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   b> framework: crystallographic and <SUP>133</SUP>Cs NMR spectroscopic
   studies
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB Temperature-variable single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Cs-133 NMR studies were performed for a cyanido-bridged layered metamagnet, Cs4CoII[W-V(CN)(8)]Cl-3 (1), to elucidate the origin of its unusually high thermal durability up to ca. 523 K (250 degrees C). 1 reveals a layered structure composed of negatively charged two-dimensional cyanido-bridged Co-W layers ({Cs4CoII[W-V(CN)(8)]Cl-3}(4-)) and cesium ions between and within the layers, where there is a lack of both non-coordinated and coordinated solvent molecules that is an important and characteristic feature of the crystal structure. The cesium ions are surrounded by chlorides and cyanides of the coordination layers, and some Cs+... Cl-, Cs+... N, and Cs+... C distances are shorter than the estimated sums of an ionic radius of Cs+ and ionic or van der Waals radii of Cl-/CN-. These short distances suggest strong interactions between Cs+ and Cl-/CN-, which stabilize the crystal structure by connecting the layers. The temperature-dependent single-crystal structural analyses show that there is no significant structural change upon heating up to 473 K, and indicate that the short distances between Cs+ and Cl-/CN- still remain. Thus, the high thermal durability of 1 is due to not only the absence of solvent molecules but also the existence of strong Cs+... Cl- and Cs+...-NC interactions. The Cs-133 NMR spectrum shows four peaks assignable to the four independent Cs+ ions in the crystal structure. The observed peaks were located in high ppm owing to the hyperfine interactions between the nuclear spin of Cs and electron spins from the magnetic centers CoII and WV. As temperature increased, the peaks moved to low ppm, and the shifts of the peaks are expressed by the Curie-Weiss law indicating no large structural changes around Cs+ ions, that is, the Cs+ ions are fixed at the same positions. This proves the presence of strong interactions involving Cs+ and terminal ligands of cyanido-bridged layers of 1 being responsible for its high thermal stability.

TI Dynamic phenomena in magnetic ternary alloys
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB We apply Monte Carlo simulation with local spin update Metropolis algorithm to investigate dynamic critical phenomena in a magnetic ternary alloy system with the chemical formula AB(p)C(1-p) comprising ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions simultaneously. We perform a detailed investigation of the critical behavior of the system by presenting the phase diagrams in various planes and corresponding thermal and magnetic features as functions of several adjustable parameters, such as the temperature, mixing ratio p and external field amplitude h(0). We also revisit the equilibrium critical phenomena of the system which were previously handled by several theoretical tools and we re-examine former, widely studied properties. It is a fact that magnetic ternary alloy system has a special point at which the phase transition temperature of the system becomes independent of mixing ratio of ions B and C in equilibrium. However, our detailed results explicitly show that when a magnetic ternary alloy system is subject to a periodically driven time-dependent magnetic field, special point character of system tends to disappear, and hereby dynamic phase transition characteristics of the system begin to depend on the active concentrations of magnetic components.

TI Mechanism for Catalytic Stability Enhancement of
   Fe<SUP>III</SUP>[Co<SUP>III</SUP>(CN)6] by Doping Divalent
   Ions for Organophosphate Hydrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Catalytic activity and stability of iron hexacyanocobaltate (FeIII[CoIII(CN)6],Fe-Co) for organophosphate hydrolysis are improved by doping of divalent metal ions (MII=MnII,NiII,orCuII). The catalytic activity of a series of (FeIII0.8MII0.3)[CoIII(CN)6](FeM-Cocompounds) was examined in a mixed solution of water and ethanol [9:1 (v/v)] containing disodiump-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) at 60 degrees C.FeM-Cocompoundsexhibited high conversions (>= 60%, 25 h), which are about four times that of Fe-Co(16%). Repetitive catalytic examinations indicated that theconversion at the second runs in the systems usingFeM-Cocompoundsmaintained over 90% of those at thefirst runs. The low catalytic activity ofFe-Coin the mixed solution resulted from decomposition due to leaching of FeIIIions by ligand exchange from the CN ligand top-NPP as evidenced by IR and XPS measurements for recovered precipitatesafter catalytic examination. Thus, the catalytic stability enhancement observed inFeM-Cocompounds resulted from weakerinteraction betweenp-NPP and FeIIIions, which can be evidenced by reduced surface acidity evaluated from temperature-programmed desorption of pyridine on the surfaces. The heats of pyridine adsorption onFeM-Cocompound surfaces were around60-80 kJ mol-1, which were less than half that ofFe-Co(160 kJ mol-1). Based on these results, a mechanism is proposed for securing Fe-NC bonds and enhancing the catalytic stability by doping of divalent metal ions to Fe-Co.

TI The single-ion anisotropy effects in the mixed-spin ternary-alloy
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB The effect of single-ion anisotropy on the thermal properties of the ternary-alloy in the form of AB(p)C(1-p) is investigated on the Bethe lattice (BL) in terms of exact recursion relations. The simulation on the BL consists of placing A atoms (spin-1/2) on the odd shells and randomly placing B (spin-3/2) or C (spin-5/2) atoms with concentrations p and 1 - p, respectively, on the even shells. The phase diagrams are calculated in possible planes spanned by the system parameters: temperature, single-ion anisotropy, concentration and ratio of the bilinear interaction parameters for z = 3 corresponding to the honeycomb lattice. It is found that the crystal field drives the system to the lowest possible state therefore reducing the temperatures of the critical lines in agreement with the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Structural and Gas Retention Changes Induced by Ozonization of
   Cobalt(II) and Manganese(II) Hexacyanocobaltates(III)
SO CRYSTALS
AB Transition metal hexacyanocobaltates are porous materials with open metal sites and a wide variety of pores. In this work, manganese(II) and cobalt(II) hexacyanocobaltates(III) have been selected to explore the interactions between the open metal sites located in their pores and the guest molecules: hydrogen, carbon dioxide, water and methanol. An experimental setup was designed and implemented to conduct post-synthesis modification of the solids with ozone. Samples were dehydrated, ozonized and saturated with methanol in situ. Ozone molecules acted on the open metal sites changing their oxidation state, causing a contraction of the unit cell and inducing a stronger interaction of the molecules of water and methanol with the lattice. This strengthening prevented the lattice from being evacuated without compromising its framework stability. The decomposition temperature decreased in all ozonized samples as a consequence of the elongation and weakening of the cobalt-carbon bond. Active infrared and Raman bands were used to monitor the interaction between the open metal sites at the framework surface and the guest molecules. The cell contraction and the presence of residual methanol molecules in the porosity reduced the hydrogen and carbon dioxide retention capacity of the samples.

TI Asymmetric K/Li-Ion Battery Based on Intercalation Selectivity
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Using ab initio calculations combined with experimental confirmation, we design an asymmetric intercalation battery using K2NiFeII(CN)(6) as the cathode, commercial graphite as the anode, and an organic electrolyte containing mixed lithium and potassium salts. It works by reversible K-ion intercalation at the cathode side and reversible Li-ion intercalation at the anode side simultaneously. The pi-electron coordination environment in K2NiFeII(CN)6 ensures the preferred reversible intercalation of the K-ion, and the small ionic radius ensures the preferred reversible intercalation of the Li-ion in graphite. It also shows a high working voltage (similar to 3.6 V) and an ultralong cycling life with no capacity fading even after 5000 cycles.

TI Rhombohedral Potassium-Zinc Hexacyanoferrate as a Cathode Material for
   Nonaqueous Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Rhombohedral potassium-zinc hexacyanoferrate K1.88Zn2.88[Fe(CN)(6)](2)(H2O)(5) (KZnHCF) synthesized using a precipitation method is demonstrated as a high-voltage cathode material for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), exhibiting an initial discharge capacity of 55.6 mAh g(-1) with a discharge voltage of 3.9 V versus K/K+ and a capacity retention of similar to 95% after 100 cycles in a nonaqueous electrolyte. All K ions are extracted from the structure upon the initial charge process. However, only 1.61 out of 1.88 K ions per formula unit are inserted back into the structure upon discharge, and it becomes the reversible ion of the second cycle onward. Despite the large ionic size of K, the material exhibits a lattice-volume change (similar to 3%) during a cycle, which is exceptionally small among the cathode materials for PIBs. The distinct feature of the material seems to come from the unique porous framework structure built by ZnN4 and FeC6 polyhedra linked via the C  Nbond and a Zn/Fe atomic ratio of 3/2, resulting in high structural stability and cycle performance.

TI Concentration dependence of Li<SUP>+</SUP>/Na<SUP>+</SUP> diffusion in
   manganese hexacyanoferrates
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrates (Mn-HCFs) with a jungle-gym-type structure are promising cathode materials for Li+/Na+ secondary batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Here, we investigated the diffusion constants D-Li/D-Na of Li+/Na+ against the Li+/Na+ concentration x(Na)/x(Li) and temperature (T) of A(1.32)Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.833)center dot 6H(2)O (A = Li and Na). We evaluated the activation energy E-a(Li)/E-a(Na) of DLi/DNa against xN(a/)x(Li). We found that E-a(Na) steeply increases with x(Na) from 0.41 eV at x(Na) = 0.69 to 0.7 eV at 1.1. The increase in E-a(Na) is ascribed to the occupancy effect of the Na+ site. The increase in E-a(Li) is suppressed, probably because the number of Li+ sites is three times that of Na+ sites.

TI Binary metal co-substituted P2-type
   Na0.67Mn0.7Cu0.15
   Ni0.15O2 microspheres as robust cathode
   for high-power sodium ion battery
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Developing suitable cathode materials is essential to promote the development of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, Ni, Cu co-substituted P2-type Na0.67Mn0.7Cu0.15Ni0.15O2 microspheres are designed and synthesized through high temperature solid reaction using MnO2 template. Compared with pristine Na0.67MnO2, or monometal substituted Na0.67Mn0.7Ni0.3O2 and Na0.67Mn0.7Cu0.3O2, this binary metal co-substituted Na0.67Mn0.7Cu0.15Ni0.15O2 microsphere shows markedly enhanced electrochemical performance as cathode material for SIBs, especially for long-term cycling stability and high rate capability. For the rate capability measurements, when the current increases from 50 mA g(-1) to high current of 2000 mA g (40-folds increase), the capacity retention can be kept for 65.0%. And for the long-term cycling performance within 1000 cycles, a capacity of 74.1 mAh g(-1) can be maintained in the voltage range of 2.0-4.0 V at high current of 1000 mA g corresponding to a capacity retention of 88.1%. The impressive cycling stability and rate capability should be attributed to the stable microsphere structure and synergistic effect of electrochemical active Ni, Cu co-existence in P2 phase lattice. Coupled with presodiation MoSe2/P-C anode and assembled into full cells, the specific capacities are almost matched with those in half-cells, delivering a considerable energy density of 200 Wh Kg(-1).

TI Role of Surface Effects in the Vibrational Density of States and the
   Vibrational Entropy in Spin Crossover Nanomaterials: A Molecular
   Dynamics Investigation
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB Size reduction effects on the lattice dynamics of spin crossover (SCO) thin films have been investigated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the density of vibrational states. The proposed simple model structure and reduced force field allows us to obtain good orders of magnitude of the sound velocity in both spin states and takes into account the contribution of free surfaces in the vibrational properties of very thin films (below a thickness of 12 nm). The slab method issue from the field of surface physico-chemistry has been employed to extract surface thermodynamic quantities. In combination with the related slab-adapted method, the slab approach provides a powerful numerical tool to separate surface contributions from finite-size effects. Due to the relatively low stiffness of SCO materials, the lattice dynamics seems to be governed by surface instead of confinement effects. The size evolution of thermodynamic quantities is successfully reproduced, especially the increase of the vibrational entropy with the size reduction, in good agreement with experimental observations.

The bilinear interaction parameter J(AB) is assumed to be ferromagnetic between the nearest-neighbor spins with spin-3/2 and spin-2, while J(AC) is taken to be antiferromagnetic between spin-3/2 and spin-5/2. The possible phase diagrams are obtained from the thermal analysis of the order parameters for the given coordination numbers z = 3,4,5 and 6. This analysis has also revealed that the model gives both second-and first-order phase transitions in addition to the compensation temperatures.

TI Regulating the exposed crystal facets of electrode materials for Na-ion
   batteries: A review of recent advancements and future perspectives
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Low-cost Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have manifested enormous potential for stationary energy storage and low speed vehicles. Despite their potential advantages, the use of large and heavy Na+ ions as charge carriers in NIBs results in relatively slow kinetics and an inferior rate capacity. Moreover, Na+ de-intercalation is commonly accompanied by irreversible phase transition and sizeable volume changes, leading to structural degradation and capacity decay. Recent advancements have shown that tailoring the crystal growth direction and employing specific exposed crystal facets can bring about significant improvement in the electrochemical performance of electrode materials for NIBs. This review presents an overview of the key techniques for optimizing crystal growth direction, including surfactant addition, template-assisted synthesis, and foreign ion doping, followed by a detailed discussion pertaining to the corresponding regulatory mechanisms. Subsequently, the structure-activity relationship between crystal orientation design and Na storage performance is thoroughly examined with regards to the crystal anisotropy of cathode and anode materials. The prevalent challenges and new developments in regulating crystal orientation have been discussed given the development of high-performance NIB electrodes.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Owing to their high cost and safety hazards, and the low abundance of Li in natural resources, the future of Li-ion batteries is becoming difficult. To replace Li-ion batteries, aqueous multivalent ion batteries are considered to be a worthwhile choice. In particular, aqueous zinc ion batteries are becoming an attractive option due to the natural abundance and unique properties of zinc. However, as for the Li-ion battery, the Zn-ion battery also has its own inadequacies in terms of cathodes. Finding a suitable cathode material for Zn-ion batteries with adequate structural stability and high capacity is an uphill task for researchers. This review presents the recent developments of various cathode materials in zinc ion batteries and their effectiveness towards the advancement of Zn-ion batteries. Based on the collected literature, various strategies adopted for enhancing the performance of Zn-ion batteries are also briefly discussed in this review. Furthermore, the explicit progress and future perspectives of Zn-ion batteries are also discussed.

TI Nickel-cobalt phosphide terephthalic acid nano-heterojunction as
   excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Recent research has focused on preparing excellent and inexpensive bifunctional transition metal electrocatalysts, which is challenging. Herein, a facile synthesis strategy for preparing self-supported nickel-cobalt phosphides using terephthalic acid (H2BDC) as metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor is reported. The incorporation of the MOF precursors modulated the electronic structures and improved the performance of the bimetallic transition metal phosphides with the as-prepared electrocatalyst requiring low overpotentials of 170 mV and 323 mV to reach 50 mAcm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, the electrocatalyst is employed in an alkaline water electrolyzer and requires 1.57 V to attain a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) with long-term stability, surpassing many reported MOF-derived bimetallic transition metal phosphide (TMPs) electrocatalysts. This work explores the incorporation of a rarely studied MOF precursor into self-supported bimetallic TMPs and opens the prospects of designing efficient MOF-derived electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

TI Enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Co bimetallic
   chalcogenides for efficient water-splitting application
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Because of a high global energy demand and challenging sustainability requirements, hydrogen has been promoted as a clean and green energy carrier allowing the potential replacement of nonrenewable fossil fuels. Hydrogen is a renewable energy carrier that does not contribute to CO2 emissions, and it holds the highest gravimetric energy density. It can be produced by the electrochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Herein, we investigate the bifunctional activity of bimetallic oxide, sulfide, and selenide nanostructures in water electrolysis. Spinel-type, phase-pure NiCo2O4, NiCo2S4, and NiCo2Se4 with comparable morphological properties were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The electrocatalytic characterization of NiCo2Se4 was found to demonstrate higher oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction activities (245 mV and 122 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2), respectively) compared to those of NiCo2O4 and NiCo2S4. Furthermore, a lab-scale water-splitting system was fabricated to examine the bifunctional properties of bimetallic nanostructures. A NiCo2Se4-based water-splitting system was found to require a cell voltage of 1.58 V, which is lower than that required by NiCo2S4 (1.64 V)- and NiCo2O4 (1.75 V)-based systems.

TI Opto-Spintronics: Photoisomerization-Induced Spin State Switching at 300
   K in Photochrome Cobalt-Dioxolene Thin Films
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Controllable quantum systems are under active investigation for quantum computing, secure information processing, and nonvolatile memory. The optical manipulation of spin quantum states provides an important strategy for quantum control with both temporal and spatial resolution. Challenges in increasing the lifetime of photoinduced magnetic states at T > 200 K have hindered progress toward utilizing photomagnetic materials in quantum device architectures. Here we demonstrate reversible light-induced magnetization switching in an organic thin film at device operating temperatures of 300-330 K. By utilizing photochromic ligands that undergo structural changes in the solid state, the changes in ligand field associated with photoisomerization modulate the ligand field and in turn the oxidation and spin state of a bound metal center. Green light irradiation (lambda(exc) = 550 nm) of a spirooxazine cobalt-dioxolene complex induces photoisomerization of the ligand that in turn triggers a reversible intramolecular charge-transfer coupled spin-transition process at the cobalt center. The generation of photomagnetic states through conversion between a low-spin Co(III)-semiquinone doublet and a high-spin Co(II)-bis-semiquinone sextet state has been demonstrated in both solution and the solid state and is described as a photoisomerization-induced spin charge excited state (PISCES) process. The high transition temperature (325 K) and long-lived photoinduced state (tau = 10 s at 300 K) are dictated by the photochromic ligand. Theory provides effective modeling of the phenomenon and long-term strategies to further modulate the lifetimes of photomagnetic states for quantum information technologies at the single molecule level.

TI Porous Structural Properties of K or Na-Co Hexacyanoferrates as
   Efficient Materials for CO2 Capture
SO MATERIALS
AB The stoichiometry of the components of hexacyanoferrate materials affecting their final porosity properties and applications in CO2 capture is an issue that is rarely studied. In this work, the effect that stoichiometry of all element components and oxidation states of transition metals has on the structures of mesoporous K or Na-cobalt hexacyanoferrates (CoHCFs) and CO2 removal is reported. A series of CoHCFs model systems are synthesized using the co-precipitation method with varying amounts of Co ions. CoHCFs are characterized by N-2 adsorption, TGA, FTIR-ATR, XRD, and XPS. N-2 adsorption results reveal a more developed external surface area (72.69-172.18 m(2)/g) generated in samples containing mixtures of K+/Fe2+/Fe3+ ions (system III) compared to samples with Na+/Fe2+ ions (systems I, II). TGA results show that the porous structure of CoHCFs is affected by Fe and Co ions oxidation states, the number of water molecules, and alkali ions. The formation of two crystalline cells (FCC and triclinic) is confirmed by XRD results. Fe and Co oxidation states are authenticated by XPS and allow for the confirmation of charges involved in the stabilization of CoCHFs. CO2 removal capacities (3.04 mmol/g) are comparable with other materials reported. CO2 adsorption kinetics is fast (3-6 s), making CoHCFs attractive for continuous operations. Q(st) (24.3 kJ/mol) reveals a physical adsorption process. Regeneration effectiveness for adsorption/desorption cycles indicates similar to 1.6% loss and selectivity (similar to 47) for gas mixtures (CO2:N-2 = 15:85). The results of this study demonstrate that the CoHCFs have practical implications in the potential use of CO2 capture and flue gas separations.

TI Triple mixed-spin Ising model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B
AB The A, B and C atoms with spin-1/2, spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 are joined together sequentially on the Bethe lattice in the form of ABCABC... to simulate a molecule as a triple mixed-spin system. The spins are assumed to be interacting with only their nearest-neighbors via bilinear exchange interaction parameter in addition to crystal and external magnetic fields. The order-parameters are obtained in terms of exact recursion relations, then from the study of their thermal variations, the phase diagrams are calculated on the possible planes of our system. It is found that the model gives only second-order phase transitions in addition to the compensation temperatures.

TI All Binder-Free Electrodes for High-Performance Wearable Aqueous
   Rechargeable Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB Extensive efforts have recently been devoted to the construction of aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (ARSIBs) for large-scale energy-storage applications due to their desired properties of abundant sodium resources and inherently safer aqueous electrolytes. However, it is still a significant challenge to develop highly flexible ARSIBs ascribing to the lack of flexible electrode materials. In this work, nanocube-like KNiFe(CN)(6) (KNHCF) and rugby ball-like NaTi2(PO4)(3) (NTP) are grown on carbon nanotube fibers via simple and mild methods as the flexible binder-free cathode (KNHCF@CNTF) and anode (NTP@CNTF), respectively. Taking advantage of their high conductivity, fast charge transport paths, and large accessible surface area, the as-fabricated binder-free electrodes display admirable electrochemical performance. Inspired by the remarkable flexibility of the binder-free electrodes and the synergy of KNHCF@CNTF and NTP@CNTF, a high-performance quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped ARSIB (FARSIB) is successfully assembled for the first time. Significantly, the as-assembled FARSIB possesses a high capacity of 34.21 mAh cm(-3) and impressive energy density of 39.32 mWh cm(-3). More encouragingly, our FARSIB delivers superior mechanical flexibility with only 5.7% of initial capacity loss after bending at 90 degrees for over 3000 cycles. Thus, this work opens up an avenue to design ultraflexible ARSIBs based on all binder-free electrodes for powering wearable and portable electronics.

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANORGANISCHE UND ALLGEMEINE CHEMIE
AB Six new hexanuclear niobium cluster compounds of the general formula [Nb6Cl14L4]x(solvent molecule) [L = neutral O or N donor ligand, x = 0-2.5; pyrimidine (1), 1-methyl imidazole (2), isobutyronitrile (3), isopropyl alcohol (4), triphenylphosphine oxide (5), dimethyl sulfoxide (6)] were prepared. The syntheses were carried out by dehydration of the precursor [Nb6Cl14(H2O)(4)]4H(2)O with different water scavangers, like acetic anhydride, trimethyl acetic anhydride and diethylcarbonate in the presence of the corresponding neutral ligand. The structures are determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The specific bonding situations of the ligands to the [Nb6Cl12](2+) cluster cores are compared and discussed. The phenomenon of the observed M-6 distortion is explained and interpreted based on the matrix effect and the terminal ligand effect. In addition, other interactions between the cluster units, such as hydrogen bonding and - stacking are discussed.

TI Electrochemical Performance of NaFeFe(CN)6 Prepared by Solid
   Reaction for Sodium Ion Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Commercially available Na4Fe(CN)(6) and Fe-4[Fe(CN)(6)](3) are two cheap compounds that have ever been investigated as positive electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, poor electronic conductivity of Na4Fe(CN)(6) and sodium deficiency of Fe-4[Fe(CN)(6)](3) prevent these two materials from being used in practical rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. In this paper, a NaFeFe(CN)(6) cathode material was synthesized by ball milling the Fe-4[Fe(CN)(6)](3)/Na4Fe(CN)(6) mixture. The obtained NaFeFe(CN)(6) demonstrated a single cubic phase indexed to Fm3m space group similar to Fe-4[Fe(CN)(6)](3) but with larger lattice parameter due to the existence of Na+ in the lattice framework. The NaFeFe(CN)(6) electrode delivered first desodiation capacity of 119.4 mAh g(-1) and first sodiation capacity of 153.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.05C rate. The NaFeFe(CN)(6) showed excellent cycling stability with reversible capacities of 118.2 mAh g(-1) and 96.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and 1C rate, respectively. In-situ XRD analyses demonstrated a single cubic phase process during charge-discharge of NaFeFe(CN)(6) electrode. Low water content benefited from the solid reaction method and the homogenous single phase process during charge/discharge assured the stable long term cycling performance of the NaFeFe(CN)(6) product.

TI Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivative as electrode
   materials for lithium-ion batteries
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Efficient storage of energy is the key to improving the utilization of clean energy. It is urgent to design and prepare a battery system with high specific volume, long cycle life, and fast charge-discharge characteristics. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivative materials have both the functional characteristics of metal ion host and organic ligand guest and have the advantages of large surface area, adjustable pores, structure, and composition. They can be directly applied, and they can be compounded to derive specific structural materials, showing unique advantages and application prospects in energy conversion and storage applications. This paper is mainly based on MOFs and their derivative materials, focusing on lithium-ion batteries with high specific energy, environmental friendliness, and large-scale energy storage. The optimization and application of MOFs and their derivatives in the microstructure and composition control of lithium-ion battery electrode materials are discussed in terms of preparation methods and battery performance, which is conducive to constructing electrode materials with abundant active sites and improving the charge transport movement of electrode materials. In general, MOFs have a very good performance improvement effect on the electrode materials of lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hematite Nanorods Photoanodes Decorated by Cobalt Hexacyanoferrate: The
   Role of Mixed Oxidized States on the Enhancement of Photoelectrochemical
   Performance
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB In this work, we report on the incorporation of cobalt hexacyanoferrate (Co-NC-Fe) with different iron oxidation states (Fe-II and Fe-III) on hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanorod photoanodes with a systematic investigation of enhanced photoelectrochemical performance under a neutral pH. A detailed investigation using in situ techniques was carried out to understand the fundamental aspects of chemical reactions during photoelectrochemical characterization. The alpha-Fe2O3/Co-NC-Fe photoanodes showed a higher photoelectrochemical performance compared to the individual materials. Despite the higher achieved performance of alpha-Fe2O3/Co-NC-Fe, the elucidation of the main contribution upon Co-NC-Fe incorporation was found to be dependent on the different charge transfer mechanism under light illumination. Therefore, given the complexity of the redox processes that take place in Co-NC-Fe under an applied bias, we have systematically investigated the dark- and light-induced effects on alpha-Fe2O3/Co-NC-Fe by in situ UV-vis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies. These techniques allowed us to monitor the effect of the electro and photoelectrochemical potential in several redox processes. The insightful results indicate that, in addition to surface state modification effects, the improvement of the photocurrent density may also result from long-lived holes at the electrode surface as a consequence of the electron transfer from the conduction band alpha-Fe2O3 to Co-NC-Fe with a Fe-III oxidation state. This indicates a second electron pathway during charge separation, thereby contributing to the increase in the electron-hole pair lifetime and the accumulation of photogenerated holes at the alpha-Fe2O3/Co-NC-Fe photoanode surface to drive water oxidation.

SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted extensive attention and are considered to be promising energy storage devices, owing to their low cost, eco-friendliness, and high security. However, insufficient energy density has become the bottleneck for practical applications, which is greatly influenced by their cathodes and makes the exploration of high-performance cathodes still a great challenge. This review underscores the recent advances in the rational design of advanced cathodes for AZIBs. The review starts with a brief summary and evaluation of cathode material systems, as well as the introduction of proposed storage mechanisms. Then, fundamental problems associated with ion and electron transport behaviors inside the electrode will be pointed out and followed by potential solutions, aiming to reveal the correlation between cathode architecture design and efficient transport kinetics through structural engineering. Afterward, the structural engineering for designing advanced cathodes, including interlayer intercalation, doping effects, defect engineering, surface coatings, composite formation, and morphology control, are summarized and discussed from the view of experimental and theoretical results. Finally, the critical research challenges and future perspectives on advanced cathode materials as well as the potential developing directions of AZIBs are also given.

SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Aqueous zinc-iodine (Zn-I2) batteries are one kind of appealing battery systems due to their high energy density (310 W h kg  1), intrinsic safety, low cost, long lifetime, and environmental-friendliness. Nevertheless, Zn-I2 batteries still suffer from severe problems such as polyiodide shuttle, fast self-discharge, slow iodine conversion kinetics, and low I2 loading mass, besides the common hurdles of Zn metal anodes including inhomogeneous Zn electrodeposition and water-related passivation/corrosion. Over the past decades, enormous research efforts have been dedicated to tackling the above obstacles. In this review, we first introduce the electrochemistry of iodine conversion and the underlying working mechanism in aqueous rechargeable Zn-I2 batteries. Then, we indepth discuss the fundamental challenges of iodine conversion reactions and the component/structural design of I2 host materials. Finally, we share our thoughts on the prospects of Zn-I2 batteries. This review is anticipated to provide valuable guidance for the further development of high-performance Zn-I2 batteries.

AB Aqueous energy devices are under the spotlight of current research due to their safety, low cost and ease of handling. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives have spurred extensive exploration as they provide a library of new electrode materials. The rich and structural flexibilities (such as metal nodes, ligands, pore structure) endow MOFs and MOFs-derivatives with vast opportunities for various energy devices. In this review, we discuss the correlation between MOF structural parameters and electrochemical performance for aqueous energy devices in the scope of zinc-based batteries (Znion, Zn-alkaline and Zn-air batteries), potassium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. For each energy device, the effect of determinative factors and structural modulating strategies of MOFs and derivatives are highlighted. Finally, we summarize the challenges and provide our perspective about MOFs and derivatives for future aqueous energy devices.

TI Electrochemical Properties and Redox Mechanism of
   Na2Ni0.4Co0.6[Fe(CN)6]
   Nanocrystallites as High-Capacity Cathode for Aqueous Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Nickel-based ferrocyanides have attracted wide interest as cathode for aqueous sodium-ion batteries in fields of sustainable energies such as wind and solar, owing to excellent cycling stability and high-rate capability. However, they suffer from low specific capacities (similar to 60 mAh g(-1)). Herein, Na2Ni0.4Co0.6[Fe(CN)(6)] nanocrystallites are reported for the first time as high-capacity cathode for aqueous sodium-ion batteries. Its electrochemical properties and redox mechanism have been understood by combining the X-ray diffraction technique, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance microscopy, and charge/discharge measurements. It is revealed that the material undergoes a reversible three-step single-phase reaction mechanism during Na extraction through sequential electro-chemical oxidation of nitrogen-coordinated Co2+ ions and carbon coordinated Fe2+ ions and achieves superior electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 85 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, an average operating potential of 0.62 V (vs Ag/AgCl), and a high capacity retention of 90% after 100 cycles. The combination of high specific energy and good cycling performance enables the Na2Ni0.4Co0.6[Fe(CN)(6)] material exhibiting promising application for high-performance aqueous sodium-ion batteries.

TI Recent advances and future challenges in selective removal of calcium
   and magnesium ions with capacitive deionization
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Hardness problems caused by Ca2+ and Mg2+ significantly impact human production and life, greatly hindering the effective use of water resources. Meanwhile, the effective extraction of mineral resources such as calcium and magnesium from industrial waste brine has triggered widespread concern. Due to its sustainability, costeffectiveness, and low energy consumption, CDI in water treatment applications began to be constantly expanded in recent years, and its research in Ca2+ and Mg2+ selective removal showed a trend of increasing year by year. However, no comprehensive review offers a thorough analysis of this topic. Therefore, our review critically assesses CDI research advances related to calcium and magnesium ion elimination. This article reviews and categorizes general aspects of CDI and selective calcium and magnesium removal mechanisms, summarizing relevant electrode materials and highlighting factors influencing process performance. Following this, this review summarizes the current scenarios for selective application and envisions potential future applications. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in implementing CDI for the selective removal of calcium and magnesium ions have been discussed. The insights from this review will promote the further development of CDI in the field of Ca2+ and Mg2+ selective removal, as well as advance the in-depth research of CDI in ion-selective removal.

TI Atypical Metal-Center Coordination in Two Cyanide-Based Coordination
   Polymers
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB This contribution reports the crystal structure, solved and refined from single crystal XRD data, of two cyanide-based coordination polymers, with K[Cu-2(CN)(3)]center dot H2O (1) and [Cd(H2O)](2)Cd(H2O)(2)[Cu(CN)(3)Cu(CN)(2)](2)center dot 8H(2)O (2) as formula units. These coordination polymers are characterized by metal-metal bonds between copper atoms. In 1, the framework is formed by Cu-Cu(CN)(3) pseudo tetrahedral blocks linked by planar Cu-2(CN)(3) units. In this material, a defined Cu-Cu bond was identified, which is congruent with the corresponding Raman spectrum. The K atom and water molecule occupy the framework cavities. In 2, the Cu-Cu bond is observed in Cu-2(CN)(6) blocks which remain linked to Cd(NC)(2)(H2O)(4) and Cd(NC)(4)(H2O)2 units occupying their axial and equatorial coordination positions, respectively. The solid framework is completed by the -N=C-Cu-C=N- chains linked to Cd(NC)(4)(H2O)(2) moieties. The crystal structure for 2 contains two different sites for the metal centers. The structural study was complemented by recording IR, Raman, and UV/Vis spectra. These two coordination polymers behave as semiconductor materials with a band gap of 2.79 and 3.43 eV, respectively, as derived from the Tauc plot of the corresponding UV/Vis spectrum. Band structure calculations properly supported these values. 1 is a material of an indirect band gap, while 2 has a direct band gap.

TI Emerging polyanionic and organic compounds for high energy density,
   non-aqueous potassium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Potassium ion batteries (PIBs) as promising energy storage candidates have attracted increasing attention due to the low-cost and abundant potassium resources. Despite numerous emerging electrode materials, the development of PIBs has consecutively encountered major challenges compared with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), such as low reversible specific capacities, inferior cycling stabilities, and unsatisfactory energy densities. In light of this, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the development of emerging classes of cathode materials, especially for polyanionic composites and organic compounds, with the aim of achieving high energy density for non-aqueous PIBs. First of all, we highlight the recent development of electrode materials towards non-aqueous PIBs with the discussion on their existing problems and the potential solutions. Then, the recent advancements in polyanionic and organic compounds towards achieving high energy density of PIBs are provided. We focus on their structure-performance relationships with a comparison of their electrochemical properties, and further promising investigations of these types of cathode materials are identified and discussed as well. Finally, personal perspectives on future optimization on cathode materials towards realizing the real applications in PIBs are constructively discussed.

TI Recent advances in bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (BMOFs):
   synthesis, applications and challenges
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess two different metal ions as nodes in their molecular frameworks. They are prepared by either one-pot syntheses, wherein different metals are mixed with suitable ligands and linkers, or by adopting post-synthetic modifications by soaking a monometallic MOF in a concentrated solution of a different (but compatible) metal ion. These bimetallic MOFs exhibit synergistic effects and enhanced properties compared to their monometallic counterparts, such as improved adsorption selectivity, selective catalysis and structural stability. Certainly, there are still many open challenges, given that bimetallic MOFs suffer from the typical drawbacks of MOFs, including high moisture sensitivity, easy oxidation due to their varying oxidation states, and possible metal leaching in liquids. In the present perspective, progress in the research on the synthesis and properties of bimetallic MOFs has been reviewed systematically, describing the synthetic strategies adopted to prepare targeted bimetallic MOFs and their applications in gas adsorption, catalysis, energy storage and conversion, and luminescence sensing. Additionally, the challenges facing the synthesis of stable and robust bimetallic MOFs have been discussed with a final outlook on their further development prospects.

SO SMALL METHODS
AB Aqueous lithium-ion batteries offer promising advantages such as low cost, enhanced safety, high rate capability, and the ability to deliver considerable capacity at 1.8 V, making them ideal candidates for large-scale reserve power sources for renewable energy. However, the practical application of aqueous lithium-ion batteries has been hindered by the poor cycle stability of layered cathode materials, including LiCoO2, in neutral aqueous electrolytes. This review examines the working principles, material limitations, and research progress of aqueous lithium-ion batteries. The types and characteristics of materials used in the cathode of aqueous lithium-ion batteries are summarized, with a primary focus on the attenuation mechanisms of LiCoO2 when used as the cathode material in aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, this review explores the advancements in utilizing LiCoO2 in the cathode of aqueous lithium-ion batteries, as well as the combination with machine learning. By addressing these critical aspects, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of aqueous lithium-ion batteries and shed light on future development and application prospects.

TI The numerical investigation of ferro-ferrimagnetic half-integer mixed
   spin ternary alloy: Monte-Carlo approach
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY
AB In this work, we have investigated in detail the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic-ferrimagnetic ternary alloy (TA) given in the form as AB(p) C1-p by means of the Monte-Carlo simulations with Glauber's kinetics. We assume that this TA consists of two sublattices, one occupied by the A-type atoms of spin-1/2 only and the other one randomly occupied by the B-type (spin-3/2) or C-type (spin-5/2) atoms with probability p. The nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions between A and B or C atoms with probability p and the next NN interactions only among A atoms are considered. By exploiting the thermal analysis of the order-parameters and total susceptibility, we have mapped the phase diagrams of the model on the planes of (R = vertical bar J(AC)vertical bar/J(AB), kT(c) /J(A)B), (p, kT(c)/J(AB)), (p, kT(comp)/J(AB)), (D/J(AB), kT(c)/J(AB)) and (D/J(AB), kT(comp)/J(AB)), where R and D are the exchange interaction parameter ratio and the crystal field interaction, respectively. These investigations revealed the existence of second-order phase transitions only and up to two compensation temperatures. In addition, the analysis of the hysteresis properties of the TA, single, double or triple hysteresis loops was observed depending on the given system parameters. Our findings present an overall agreement with the literature.

TI Structure Characterization and Properties of K-Containing Copper
   Hexacyanoferrate
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Copper hexacyanoferrate, Cu-II[Fe-III(CN)(6)](2/3)center dot nH(2)O, was synthesized, and varied amounts of IC ions were inserted via reduction by K2S2O3 (aq). Ideally, the reaction can be written as Cu-II[Fe-III(CN)(6)](2/3)-nH(2)O + 2x/3K(+) + 2x/3e(-)K(+) <-> K-2x/3 Cu-II[Fe-x(II).Fe-1-x(II),(CN)(6)](2/3)-nH(2)O. Infrared, Raman, and Mossbauer spectroscopy studies show that Fe-II is continuously reduced to Fell with increasing x, accompanied by a decrease of the a-axis of the cubic Fn (3) over barm unit cell. Elemental analysis of K by inductively coupled plasma shows that the insertion only begins when a significant fraction similar to 10% of the Fe-III, has already been reduced. Thermogravimetric analysis shows a fast exchange of water with ambient atmosphere and a total weight loss of similar to 26 wt % upon heating to 180 degrees C, above which the structure starts to decompose. The crystal structures of Cu-III[Fe-III(CN)(6)](2/3)center dot nH(2)O and K2/3Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](2/3)center dot nH(2)O were refined using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data. In both, one-third of the Fe(CN)(6) groups are vacant, and the octahedron around Cull is completed by water molecules. In the two structures, difference Fourier maps reveal three additional zeolitic water sites (8c, 32f, and 48g) in the center of the cavities formed by the-Cu-N-C-Fe- framework. The K-containing compound shows an increased electron density at two of these sites (32f and 48g), indicating them to be the preferred positions for the K+ ions.

TI Greenly Reduced CoFe-PBA/Nickel Foam: A Robust Dual Electrocatalyst for
   Solar-Driven Alkaline Water Electrolysis with a Low Cell Voltage
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB Development of eco-friendly efficient dual electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) gaining increased attention for renewable energy production. Here, the greenly synthesized rCoFe-PBA was established as durable and effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and OER process. The rCoFe-PBA coated Nickel foam electrode exhibit overpotential of 311 mV (OER) and 100 mV (HER) @ 10 mA cm(-2) significantly lower than commercial IrO2 (381 mV) and near to Pt/C (36 mV). The rCoFe-PBA show smaller Tafel slope (OER: 57 mV dec(-1)) than IrO2 (78 mV dec(-1)) and exhibit Tafel slope of 131 mV dec(-1) (HER) which is near to Pt (90 mV dec(-1)). Turnover frequency (TOF) was estimated as 0.22 s(-1) (OER) and 0.26 s(-1) (HER) was found to be 5 and 10 times higher than IrO2 catalyst (0.040 s(-1)) and Pt/C catalyst (0.025 s(-1)), respectively. For solar water electrolysis, rCoFe-PBA/NF shows overpotential of 411 mV and durability over 180 h in 1.0 m KOH (4.1 % potential loss). The combination of non-precious electrolyzer, rCoFe-PBA with commercial solar cell produced H-2 gas in alkaline water under sunlight. This methodology proves that the greenly synthesized rCoFe-PBA electrolyzer can outperform the precious electrocatalysts, implying that the cost-effective large scale H-2 production without artificial current is possible with commercial solar cells.

AB The highly dynamic nature of grid-scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy-storage solution for renewable-energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes. In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and 1D/2D/3D and over-3D-tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over-3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes are developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li+, Na+, K+, H+, NH4+, and Zn2+, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.

TI Curating Metal-Organic Frameworks To Compose Robust Gas Sensor Arrays in

SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), tunable, nanoporous materials, are alluring recognition elements for gas sensing. Mimicking human olfaction, an array of cross-sensitive, MOF-based sensors could enable analyte detection in complex, variable gas mixtures containing confounding gas species. Herein, we address the question: given a set of MOF candidates and their adsorption properties, how do we select the optimal subset to compose a sensor array that accurately and robustly predicts the gas composition via monitoring the adsorbed mass in each MOF? We first mathematically formulate the MOF-based sensor array problem under dilute conditions. Instructively, the sensor array can be viewed as a linear map from gas composition space to sensor array response space defined by the matrix H of Henry coefficients of the gases in the MOFs. Characterizing this mapping, the singular value decomposition of H is a useful tool for evaluating MOF subsets for sensor arrays, as it determines the sensitivity of the predicted gas composition to measurement error, quantifies the magnitude of the response to changes in composition, and recovers which direction in gas composition space elicits the largest/smallest response. To illustrate, on the basis of experimental adsorption data, we curate MOFs for a sensor array with the objective of determining the concentration of CO2 and SO2 in the gas phase.

TI Progress in Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc- and Aluminum-Ion Battery
   Electrodes: Challenges and Outlook
SO ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS
AB Modern cities demand a reliable supply of electricity when and where it is needed, therefore a key design for power generators feeding on noncontinuous, nonfuel renewables is installing auxiliary battery-type energy storage systems (BESS). Batteries using Zn ions or Al ions in aqueous electrolytes are highly attractive due to low cost and elemental abundance considerations, but attaining reversibility at a high energy density and long-life operation is challenging. Here, the authors review recent reports of reversible aqueous-electrolyte batteries, focusing on how mechanisms of electrochemical activation, insertion, and conversion occur. Further, key issues related to cation mobility, electrode stability, the formation of electrode-electrolyte interface, and electrolyte decomposition, along with possible solutions or research directions for enabling superior performance of aqueous Zn-ion batteries and Al-ion batteries are explored.

TI Nafion-coated cadmium pentacyanonitrosylferrate-modified glassy carbon
   electrode for detection of dopamine in biological samples
SO BIOIMPACTS
AB Introduction: Dopamine is one of the key neurotransmitters (NTs) in nature, which plays a crucial role in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Its selective determination in the biological fluids is an essential need in the field of biomedicine studies.
   Methods: In this work, an amperometric sensor was developed using Nafion-coated cadmium pentacyanonitrosylferrate (CdPCNF) modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode (Nafion vertical bar CdPCNF vertical bar GC electrode) as an electrocatalyst to detect dopamine (DA) in human serum samples. To develop this sensor, the surface of bare GC electrode was coated with the film of CdPCNF through an electropolymerization method and then the modified electrode was coated with Nafion to minimize interferences, especially those arising from the presence of anionic compounds. The electrocatalytic behavior of the modified electrodes was studied using the cyclic voltammetry and amperometry, and then the ability of the sensor for the determination of DA in synthetic and biological samples was investigated.
   Results: The modified electrode was showed a significant electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of DA at pH 7.4. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.7 mu M and also no interference effects arose from ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA) or the other biological NTs was observed in the DA detection using the modified Nafion vertical bar CdPCNF vertical bar GC electrode.
   Conclusion: In comparison with the bare electrode, the Nafion vertical bar CdPCNF vertical bar GC electrode could determine DA in the biological samples with adequate sensitivity and selectivity. Therefore, we propose that the modified electrode is utilizable as an amperometric DA sensor for the biological sample analysis.

TI Electric-Field Control of Magnetic and Polarizability Properties of

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB We present a new microscopic approach for the description of the effects of an external direct current (dc) electric field on the magnetic, polarizability, and spectroscopic characteristics of molecular crystals containing cyanide-bridged Fe-Co clusters as structural units. In addition to the interaction with the electric field, the model allows for metal-metal electron transfer, intracluster magnetic exchange, and long-range electron-deformational interactions, which are taken into account within the mean-field approach. The external electric field gives a unique possibility to manipulate the polarizability, magnetic, and spectroscopic characteristics of cyanide-bridged Fe-Co clusters.

SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Three new cyano-bridged Fe-II-Mo(III )complexes assembled from the [Mo-III(CN)(7)](4- )unit, FeII ions, and three pentadentate N3O2 ligands, namely {[Fe2H3(dapab)(2)][Mo(CN)(6)]}n. 2H(2)O.3.5MeCN (1), [Fe(H(2)dapb)(H2O)][Fe(Hdapb)(H2O)][Mo-(CN)(6)].4H(2)O.3MeCN (2), and [Fe(H(2)dapba)(H2O)](2)[Mo(CN)(7)]. 6H(2)O (3) (H(2)dapab = 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(2-aminobenzoylhydrazone), H(2)dapb = 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(benzoylhydrazone), H(2)dapba = 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(4-aminobenzoylhydrazone)), have been synthesized and characterized. Single-crystal structure analyses suggest that complex 1 contains a one-dimensional (1D) chain structure where two FeII ions are bridged by the in situ generated [Mo-III(CN)(6)](3-) unit through two trans-cyanide groups into trinuclear (Fe2MoIII)-Mo-II clusters that are further linked by the amino of the ligand into an infinite chain. Complexes 2 and 3 are cyano-bridged (Fe2MoIII)-Mo-II trinuclear clusters with two FeII ions connected by the [Mo-III(CN)(6)](3)- and [Mo-III(CN)(7)](4-) units, respectively. Direct current magnetic studies confirmed the ferromagnetic interactions between the cyano-bridged FeII and MoIII centers and significant easy-axis magnetic anisotropy for all three complexes. Furthermore, complexes 1-3 exhibit slow magnetic relaxation under a zero dc field, with relaxation barriers of 42.3, 21.6, and 14.4 K, respectively, making them the first examples of cyano-bridged Fe-II-Mo-III single-molecule magnets.

TI Cobalt-embedded carbon nanofiber derived from a coordination polymer as
   a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for activating oxone in water
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Carbon fiber (CF) supported cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) are promising catalysts for activating Oxone because carbon is non-metal and earth-abundant, and CF-based catalysts exhibit a high aspect ratio, which affords more accessible and dense catalytic sites. Nevertheless, most of CF-supported catalysts are fabricated by post-synthetic methods, which involve complicated preparations. More importantly, metallic NPs are attached to the outer surface of CF rather than embedded within CF. However, there is still a great demand for developing Co-bearing carbon fibers for Oxone activation via simple and effective methods. Thus, this study proposes to develop a cobalt NP-embedded carbon nanofiber (CCNF) by a simple hydrothermal reaction of Co and nitrilotriacetic acid (NA), followed by one-step carbonization. Owing to the coordinative structure of CoNA, the derivative CCNF exhibits a fibrous carbon matrix embedded with evenly distributed and densely packed Co3O4 and magnetic Co-0 nanoparticles. The fibrous structure, magnetism and embedded Co NPs enable CCNF to be a promising catalyst for Oxone activation. As degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) is selected as a model reaction, CCNF not only rapidly activates Oxone to fully degrade RhB but also shows a much higher catalytic activity than the most common Oxone activator, Co3O4. CCNF also exhibits the lowest activation energy than any reported catalysts for Oxone activation to degrade RhB. In addition, CCNF could be re-used to activate Oxone for RhB degradation. These results indicate that CCNF is a conveniently prepared and highly effective fibrous Co/C hybrid material for activating Oxone to oxidize contaminants in water.

AB In this work, we studied the dynamic magnetic features of a mixed ferro-ferrimagnetic ternary alloy in the form of AB(p)C(1-p). We also investigated the effect of Hamiltonian parameters on the system's dynamic magnetic features. For this aim, an AB(p)C(1-p) ternary alloy system was simulated within the mean-field approximation based on a Glauber-type stochastic dynamic, and for simplicity, we chose A, B, and C ions as S-A=1/2, S-B=1, and S-C=3/2, respectively. We found that in our dynamic system, critical temperature always depended on the concentration ratio of the ternary alloy.

TI Performance of ion intercalation materials in capacitive
   deionization/electrochemical deionization: A review
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) also referred to as electrochemical deionization (EDI) is a deionization technology which depends on the electrical potential difference applied between a pair of electrodes to extract charged species from the solution. Due to their low cost, good electrical conductivity, porous structure, and high specific sur face area, carbon materials have been the materials of choice for electrodes in most CDI cells. With carbon-based materials, ions from solution are extracted through electrosorption mechanism and stored in the electrical double layer (EDL) formed on the electrode surface. Recently, ion intercalation materials that store ions through pseudocapacitive ion intercalation have attracted interest. In pseudocapacitive ion intercalation mechanism, ions are inserted or stored in the lattice crystal structure sites of the intercalation host compounds (IHCs) due to redox reactions. The desalination performance of these materials, also referred to as salt adsorption capacity (SAC) and expressed in mg/g is reported to be higher compared to that of carbon-based electrode materials. The enhanced SAC of intercalation materials is due to the fact that ions are not only removed from the solution via surface adsorption but also through transfer of charge and intercalation/insertion of the ions into their crystallographic sites. To date, there is inadequate number of articles summarizing the performance of intercalation materials and strategies undertaken to improve performance thereof for desalination and ion separation pur poses. This paper therefore, reviewed the performance of different intercalation electrode materials for water desalination presented in the literature to date. The discussion covers different geometries/architecture of a desalination cell utilizing ion intercalation materials, performance of ion intercalation materials and their mechanism of deionization as well as strategies that have been employed to improve their deionization performance. Furthermore, this paper provides an outlook and research niches existing in the field of ion intercalation materials for desalination applications and selective removal of both mono and divalent ions from aqueous solutions.

SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Double metal cyanides (DMCs) are well known, industrially applied catalysts for ring opening polymerization reactions. In recent years, they have been studied for a variety of catalytic reactions, as well as other applications, such as energy storage and Cs sorption. Herein, a new, layered DMC phase (L-DMC), Zn-2[Co(CN)(6)](CH3COO)center dot 4H(2)O, was synthesized. The structure, which crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/m, consists of positively charged {Zn2Co(CN)(6)}(+) DMC layers linked through acetate groups and presents a new layered structure to the family of double metal cyanides. L-DMC proved to be a reusable and stable catalyst that exhibited a higher activity than the benchmark DMC catalyst in two important applications: hydroamination of phenylacetylene with 4-isopropylaniline and polymerization of 1,2-epoxyhexane.

AB The crystal structure of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF), K2x/3Cu[Fe-(CN)(6)](2/3)center dot nH(2)O, with nominal compositions x = 0.0 and x = 1.0 was studied by neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The compound crystallizes in space group Fm (3) over barm, with a = 10.1036(11) angstrom and a = 10.0588(5) angstrom for x = 0.0 and x = 1.0, respectively. Difference Fourier maps for x = 0.0 show that the coordinated water molecules are positioned at a site 1921 close to vacant N positions in the -Fe-C-N-Cu- framework, while additional zeolitic water molecules are distributed over three sites (8c, 32f, and 48g) in the -Fe-C-N-Cu- framework cavities. The refined water content for x = 0.0 is 16.8(8) per unit cell, in agreement with the ideal 16 (n = 4). For x = 1.0, the refinement suggests that 2.6 K atoms per unit cell (x = 0.98) are distributed only over the sites 8c and 32f in the cavities, and 13.9(7) water per unit cell are distributed over all the four positions. The EXAFS data for Fe, Cu, and K K-edges are in agreement with the NPD data, supporting a structure model with a linear -Fe-C-N-Cu- framework and K+ ions in the cavities.

TI Metal-organic frameworks-based catalysts for electrochemical oxygen
   evolution
SO MATERIALS HORIZONS
AB Engineering highly efficient and cost-effective catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for accelerating the development of renewable energy techniques due to the pivotal role of OER in rechargeable metal-air batteries and water electrolyzers. Recently, porous nonprecious metal catalysts (PNMCs) have received tremendous interest for application in the OER. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) built from metal ions and organic linkers have been demonstrated to be promising precursors for preparing PNMCs for the OER owing to their tunable structures/compositions, high surface area and large pore volume. Benefitting from the versatility of compositional/structural modification, MOFs and MOFs-derived PNMCs are robust in generating various high density active sites, which greatly contribute to their electrochemical OER performances. In this review, we first summarize the composition engineering of pristine MOFs and their derivatives, such as heteroatom-doped carbon, metal oxides/phosphides/sulfides/selenides and their hybrids, followed by structural/morphology engineering, including nano-coating and nano-perforating, and the configuration of high-dimensional architecture and single atom sites. Simultaneously, insights toward an in-depth understanding of the actual active sites and the intrinsic mechanism for OER enhancement are highlighted combined with experimental and theoretical studies. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for engineering MOF-based electrocatalysts are addressed.

TI Functional Defective Metal-Organic Coordinated Network of Mesostructured
   Nanoframes for Enhanced Electrocatalysis
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Although defects are traditionally perceived as undesired feature, the prevalence of tenacious low-coordinated defects can instead give rise to desirable functionalities. Here, a spontaneous etching of mesostructured crystal, cyanide-bridged cobalt-iron (CN-CoFe) organometallic hybrid into atomically crafted open framework that is populated with erosion-tolerant high surface energy defects is presented. Unprecedently, the distinct mechanistic etching pathway dictated by the mesostructured assembly, bulk defects, and strong intercoordinated cyanide-bridged hybrid mediates not only formation of excess low-coordinated defects but also more importantly stabilizes them against prevailing dissolution and migration issues. Clearly, the heteropolynuclear cyanide bonded inorganic mesostructured clusters sanction the restructuring of a new breed of stable organometallic polymorph with 3D accessible structure enclosed by electrochemical active atomic stepped edges and high index facets. The exceptional electrocatalysis performance supports the assertion that defective mesostructured polymorph offers a new material paradigm to synthetically tailor the elementary building block constituents toward functional materials.

TI Heterometallic coordination polymers as heterogeneous electrocatalysts
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Heterometallic coordination polymers are emerging as a class of crystalline materials for sustainable energy production via electrocatalysis, thanks to the synergistic and cooperative effects of different kinds of metal centres present in these polymers. The development of this class of materials mainly relies on screening experiments using a one-pot protocol of mixing metal ions; notably, the incorporation of different metal ions into desired positions in a single polymeric structure is quite difficult. This review article briefly summarizes the synthesis methods for heterometallic coordination polymers that show heterogeneous electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the relationships between the molecular structure and hydrogen evolution (water/proton reduction), oxygen evolution (water oxidation), CO2 reduction, oxygen reduction, and some important organic reactions are reviewed to offer new ideas for designing efficient energy conversion materials and developing new classes of heterometallic coordination polymers.

TI A Better Zn-Ion Storage Device: Recent Progress for Zn-Ion Hybrid
   Supercapacitors
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB As a new generation of Zn-ion storage systems, Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) garner tremendous interests recently from researchers due to the perfect integration of batteries and supercapacitors. ZHSCs have excellent integration of high energy density and power density, which seamlessly bridges the gap between batteries and supercapacitors, becoming one of the most viable future options for large-scale equipment and portable electronic devices. However, the currently reported two configurations of ZHSCs and corresponding energy storage mechanisms still lack systematic analyses. Herein, this review will be prudently organized from the perspectives of design strategies, electrode configurations, energy storage mechanisms, recent advances in electrode materials, electrolyte behaviors and further applications (micro or flexible devices) of ZHSCs. The synthesis processes and electrochemical properties of well-designed Zn anodes, capacitor-type electrodes and novel Zn-ion battery-type cathodes are comprehensively discussed. Finally, a brief summary and outlook for the further development of ZHSCs are presented as well. This review will provide timely access for researchers to the recent works regarding ZHSCs.

TI Composite-Structure Materials for Na-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Due to the growing concern of aggravated environmental problems (air pollution, global warming, etc.) and Li resources, Na-ion batteries have received significant attention as a promising alternative. Many electrode materials for Na-ion batteries have been reported in the past, especially over the past five years. However, most of these materials have a single crystalline structure and exhibit a limited electrochemical performance. Recently, some electrode materials with composite structures have been reported for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries and have attracted attention because of their enhanced comprehensive electrochemical performance. Herein, a detailed discussion on the development of these composite-structure materials for Na-ion batteries is conducted based on the crystalline structure. The structure design, identification, and adjustment of these materials are thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, the future outlook based on a mechanism analysis and a new electrode-material structure system is also introduced in this work, by reviewing previous important studies on composite-structure materials.

TI Rapid removal of tetrabromobisphenol A by
   α-Fe2O3-x@Graphene@Montmorillonite catalyst with
   oxygen vacancies through peroxymonosulfate activation: Role of halogen
   and α-hydroxyalkyl radicals
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB We employed hydrolyzed iron-pillared montmorillonite/tetracycline complex (FeOOH-Mt-TC) as precursor to prepare iron oxide@Graphene@Montmorillonite composite (alpha-Fe2O3-x@Graphene@Mt) through pyrolysis strategy under nitrogen atmosphere. During the pyrolysis process, the involvement of hydrolyzed iron (FeOOH) and TC made the alpha-Fe2O3-x@Graphene@Mt composite have superior conductivity, higher percent of structural Fe(II) and abundant oxygen vacancies, resulting in highly-efficient degradation of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in the presence of PMS. Meanwhile, O-2(center dot-) played the leading role in the oxidation process when compared with (OH)-O-center dot, SO4 center dot- and O-1(2). In addition, the released Br- from TBBPA and the addition of alcohol led to the formation of reactive halogen and alpha-hydroxyalkyl radicals, which contributed to the rapid removal of TBBPA. This study not only provided a novel strategy to prepare excellent iron-based catalysts for PMS activation, but also evaluated the application of reactive halogen and alpha-hydroxyalkyl radicals in the treatment of halogenated organic pollutants.

TI Green synthesized metal hexacyanoferrate based nanostructures for
   environmental applications
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs) are attracting much scientific interest due to their intense properties, which include variable energy band structures, unique redox properties, stability, availability, low cost, and ecofriendly catalysts compared with traditional photocatalysts. Transition metal oxides, metal sulfides, carbon derivatives, and polymers could extend electron-hole creation, improving photocatalytic efficiency and adsorption properties of MHCFs. The band gaps of MHCF are usually between 1.31 and 2.52 eV, generating e(-) and h(+) pairs that degrade pollutants. The surface area, charge, and functional groups of MHCFs impact the adsorption and degradation of contaminants. The shift towards green synthesis is necessary for environmental sustainability, health, and safety. This article concludes that the green synthesis of MHCFs and various applications of MHCFs, like adsorbing and degrading pollutants and selective removal of heavy metals and radioactive ions, make them efficient candidates for water treatment. These are effective for water treatment over a long period due to their stability under various environmental conditions. A handful of reviews on MHCFs individually discuss one of their applications, but this review provides all the information about their green synthesis and environmental applications. A comprehensive study of MHCFs has been conducted for five years. The investigation analyzed sustainable MHCFs, production, challenges, and potential future.

TI Cobalt-impregnated biochar produced from CO2-mediated
   pyrolysis of Co/lignin as an enhanced catalyst for activating
   peroxymonosulfate to degrade acetaminophen
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB While sulfate radical (SO4 center dot(-))-based processes are useful to degrade acetaminophen (ACE), studies of using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade ACE are quite limited. In addition, although Co is validated as the most effective metal for activating PMS, very few Co catalysts have been developed and investigated for activating PMS to degrade ACE. Since carbon is a promising substrate to support Co nanoparticles (NPs) to form Co/carbon composite catalysts, most existing carbon substrates require delicate fabrications. As biochar is an easy-to-obtain but versatile carbon material, pyrolysis of Co/lignin affords an advantageous Co-impregnated biochar (ColB) as an attractive catalyst for PMS activation. Specifically, as CO2 substitutes N-2 as a reaction medium for pyrolysis of Co/lignin, the syngas production from pyrolysis can be substantially improved and a magnetic ColB is afforded. This CoIB consists of evenly-distributed Co nanoparticles (NPs) impregnated in carbon matrices of biochar, and possesses several superior characteristics, such as high porosity, large surface area and magnetism, enabling ColB a promising catalyst for activating PMS to degrade ACE. ColB also shows a much higher catalytic activity of PMS activation than CoIB-N-2, and Co3O4 for degrading ACE. CoIB is also recyclable for activating PMS to effectively degrade ACE for multiple cycles. The ACE degradation pathway by this CoIB-activated PMS is proposed according to the degradation products. These findings validate that CoIB is assuredly an advantageous heterogeneous catalyst, which can be easily prepared from pyrolysis of Co/lignin in CO2 with concomitant enhanced syngas production for effectively activating PMS to degrade ACE.

TI New Tricks by Old Anions: Hydrogen Bonded Hexacyanoferrous Anionic
   Networks
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB Hexacyanoferrates are well-known to form metal organic frameworks by coordination to metal atoms or acting as hydrogen bond acceptors. In this paper we report a new type of hexacyanoferrate self-assembly, based on direct hydrogen bonding of partially protonated hexacyanoferrate anions. By preparing a series of 15 hexacyanoferrates with various organic bases, we have found that protonated hexacyanoferrates (present in 10 structures) readily form chains (two structures), two-dimensional (four structures), or three-dimensional networks (four structures), whereby the dimensionality of the network generally increases with the protonation degree of the hexacyanoferrates. The exact mode of the self-assembly, including the network type, depends on fine interplay of the pK(a) value of the base, its steric properties, and the stoichiometry of the formed solid.

TI Double Metal Cyanide (DMC) Catalysts: Synthesis, Structure, and Action
   Mechanism (A Review)
SO PETROLEUM CHEMISTRY
AB Double metal cyanide (DMC) catalysts have no alternatives for use in the industrial process of propylene oxide (PO) polymerization to obtain polypropylene oxide (PPO) with the properties required for specialty applications: low degree of unsaturation, high molecular mass, and high hydroxyl value. The modern commercial samples show high performance and allow the process to be performed with extremely low catalyst amounts (down to 25 ppm). Such amounts do not require the catalyst regeneration and to not impair the polymer properties. The main drawbacks of these materials are relatively complex synthesis and moisture sensitivity. Despite the fact that DMC catalysts are known since the 1960s, their hybrid character and variable composition still complicate their study and elucidation of the relationship between the preparation procedure, composition, and properties of these materials. This review is aimed at systematizing and analyzing the information on the synthesis, structure, and action mechanism of DMC catalysts. Both traditional synthesis and nontraditional methods for preparing DMC catalysts are described in detail. Much attention is paid to the catalytic site structure, polymerization mechanism, and physicochemical properties of these materials as heterogeneous catalysts.

TI Hierarchically porous metal-organic frameworks: synthesis strategies,
   structure(s), and emerging applications in decontamination
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high porosity have received much attention as promising materials for many applications owing to their unique properties. However, to date, most of the reported MOFs have microporous structures, which slow down diffusion/mass transfer and limit the accessibility of bulky molecules to its internal surface. Thus, it is crucial to develop an efficient way to create larger pores (mesoporous and/or macroporous) into microporous MOFs to form hierarchical porous metal-organic frameworks (HP-MOFs), which facilitate the diffusion and mass transfer of guest molecules. HP-MOFs are excellent and promising candidates for environmental applications under the background of environmental contaminations. In this review paper, we are primarily focusing on the latest progress in the preparation of HP-MOFs by employing template-assisted and template-free synthetic approaches for environmental cleaning applications. Particularly, the adsorptive purification of the most common toxic substances, including gases, dyes, heavy metal ions, and antibiotics from the environment using HP-MOFs as adsorbents is briefly discussed. The overall results clearly showed that the superiority of HP-MOFs compared with conventional microporous MOFs. Finally, we summarize the remaining challenges and provide personal perspectives on possible future development of HP-MOFs.

TI Metal organic framework-based materials for metal-ion batteries
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB The next-generation energy storage systems based on metal-ion batteries are essential for implementing renewable energy sources and the high-quality development of electric vehicles. Efficient metal-ion batteries require both high energy density and high power density. However, there are challenges in the current battery systems due to poor reaction kinetics, making them difficult to fully meet these requirements. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high porosity, multifunctionality, structural diversity, and controllable chemical composition, can serve as catalysts in electrode materials, regulate interface interactions, and improve electrochemical redox kinetics, providing new ideas and possibilities for energy storage materials. Despite these advantages, MOF-based materials are still at their early stages for their applications in the field of electrochemical energy storage and face many challenges. This article reviews the research and development of MOFbased materials in various metal-ion batteries, especially for cathodes, anodes, separators, and electrolytes due to their distinctive structure and properties. It also discusses the mechanisms for improving the electrochemical performance of metal-ion batteries. Finally, the main challenges and prospects for MOF-based materials in metalion batteries are provided.

AB Advancements in energy storage technology have led to the exploration of novel functional materials that have been at the heart of materials science, especially in this century. The distinct physical and electrochemical characteristics of ruthenates and related materials have made them potential candidates for diverse uses and device grade applications. The extensive utilization of ruthenates in metal-ion batteries has been witnessed in the recent past due to their unique structural features, electronic structure, stability, and transport properties. The current technology related to batteries suffers from inadequate storage capacity, cyclic stability, and ionic conductivity, leading to a loss in electrochemical performance, battery longevity and efficiency. The challenges related to stability, cost effectiveness, synthesis complications, and technological aspects are the key difficulties that should be considered by the community while developing the batteries for the future. To address these issues, more consistent efforts are required to ensure scalable, reproducible and controlled synthesis of these materials to fully utilize their potential for applications in rechargeable metal-ion batteries. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge, opportunities, challenges and future prospects on the utilization of ruthenates and related materials as next-generation materials for high-performance metal-ion batteries.

TI First-row transition metal compounds for aqueous metal ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB In recent years, a series of aqueous metal ion batteries (AMIBs) has been developed to improve the safety and cost-efficiency of portable electronics and electric vehicles. However, the significant gaps in energy density, power density, and cycle stability of AMIBs directly hinder them from replacing the currently widely used non-aqueous metal ion batteries, which stems from the lack of reasonable configuration and performance optimization of electrode materials. First-row transition metal compounds (FRTMCs), with the advantages of optional voltage ranges (from low to high), adjustable crystal structures (layered and tunnel types with large spacing), and designable morphology (multi-dimensional nanostructures), are widely used to construct high-performance AMIBs. However, no comprehensive review papers were generated to highlight their specific and significant roles in AMIBs. In this review, we first summarize the superiority and characteristics of FRTMCs in AMIBs. Then, we put forward control strategies of FRTMCs from subsurface engineering to inner construction to promote capacitance control and diffusion control energy storage. After that, the electrochemical performance of the FRTMCs regulation strategies in AMIBs is reviewed. Finally, we present potential directions and challenges for further enhancements of FRTMCs in AMIBs. The review aims to provide an in-depth understanding of regulation strategies for enhancing energy storage to build high-performance AMIBs that meet practical applications.

SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB In this study, based on the extensive discussion of the phase transformation process of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-MIL-88A(Fe) under thermal treatment, the catalytic performance of MIL-88A-derived iron/carbon (FexC) composites on persulfate (PS) activation for phenol degradation was investigated. FexC-600 (gamma-Fe2O3/C) exhibited a superior catalytic activity on PS activation for phenol degradation due to higher carbon content, more sp(2)-hybridized structure, carbonyl group and defective sites in composites, in which 98.23% of phenol (20 mg/L) was degraded after 60 min with 0.3 g/L catalyst and 0.3 g/L PS at ambient pH (6.1). The phenol degradation experiments and mechanism studies revealed that there was a catalytic synergism between iron oxides and carbon component in FexC 400-600 composites. Moreover, sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-), hydroxyl radical (center dot OH), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and interfacial electron transfer process all involved in the degradation of phenol by FexC 400-600 composites, but the O-1(2) -mediated non-radical oxidation was the dominant pathway rather than reactive radicals. Finally, the possible mechanism of PS activation on FexC 400-600 composites was proposed. This work discusses the synergistic catalytic mechanism of FexC composites on PS activation, and favors to provide a better understanding of the metal species and carbon component interaction in iron/carbon-based materials.

SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB It is a challenge to reversibly switch both magnetism and polarity using light irradiation. Herein we report a linear Fe2Co complex, whereby interconversion between Fe-LS(III)(mu-CN) Co-II (HS)(mu-NC)Fe-LS(III) (LS = low-spin, HS = high-spin) and Fe-LS(III)(mu-CN)Co-LS(III)(mu-NC)Fe-LS(II) linkages could be achieved upon heating and cooling, or alternating laser irradiation at 808 and 532 nm. The electron spin arrangement and charge distribution were simultaneously tuned accompanying bidirectional metal-to-metal charge transfer, providing switchable polarity and magnetism in the complex.

TI Construction of ternary NiCo2O4/MnOOH/GO composite
   for peroxymonosulfate activation with enhanced catalytic activity toward
   ciprofloxacin degradation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A catalyst, NiCo2O4/MnOOH/GO, was successfully synthesized by immobilizing NiCo2O4 and graphene oxide (GO) on MnOOH for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) with enhanced catalytic activity in ciprofloxacin (CIP) degradation. Results demonstrated 99% removal of CIP (0.02 mM) in the NiCo/Mn/GO system after 30 min at 0.2 mM of PMS and 0.15 g/L of NiCo/Mn/GO. The effects of solution pH, catalyst dose, PMS concentration, major inorganic ions, and natural organic matter (NOM) on CIP degradation were studied. The NiCo/Mn/GO exhibited good sustainability in catalytic removal efficiency for multiple uses. Furthermore, scavenger tests and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results showed that singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)), sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-), and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) were generated in the NiCo/Mn/GO + PMS system and participated in CIP degradation. The NiCo/Mn/GO is a promising catalyst for PMS activation in the degradation of CIP and other emerging contaminants.

TI Detailed Investigation of the Interplay Between the Thermal Decay of the
   Low Temperature Metastable HS State and the Thermal Hysteresis of
   Spin-Crossover Solids
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB We investigated the interplay between the thermal decay of the low temperature metastable HS state and the thermal hysteresis of the metal diluted spin-crossover complexes, [FexMn1-x(dpp)(2)(NCS)(2)].py (dpp = dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-dphenazine and py = pyridine). The thermal decay temperature T(LIESST) could be shifted into the quasi-static hysteresis range by several means: increase of the Mn content, increase of the temperature scan rate of the heating experiment, and irradiation using visible light. A detailed investigation of the isothermal relaxation of the metastable HS state at various temperatures was made and compared to simulations. The theoretical investigation based on the usual macroscopic master equation was focused on the regime change generated by the meeting of T(LIESST) and the thermal hysteresis range, and provided a qualitative agreement with the experimental data. The search of quantitative agreement led to introduction of parameter distributions and allowed illustration of the already-known drawbacks of the mean-field Ising-like model.

TI Capacitive deionization for ammonia recovery: Progresses and challenges
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Agricultural development, extensive industrialization, and rapid growth of the global population have continuously expedited ammonium pollution in aquatic environments. The issue is exacerbated by the limited efficiency of traditional treatment methods, which struggle to meet increasingly stringent standards for managing complex aquatic pollution. Recently, capacitive deionization (CDI) has demonstrated significant research advances in resource recovery, positioning it as one of the most promising technologies for ammonium recovery. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the application of CDI for ammonium recovery, addressing the controversies and limitations that need to be resolved in order to bridge the gap between experimental findings and practical advancements. A systematic classification of the CDI process and performance evaluation methods is provided. Particular attention has been focused on the principles of electrode material design and recovery mechanism of ammonium. We anticipate that the comprehensive analysis will establish a fundamental correlation between the construction of CDI systems and the performance of ammonium recovery, thereby facilitating future advancements in this field.

Exploring clean and renewable energy to diversify the world energy matrix has become an urgent matter. Less explored or unexplored renewable energy sources like the salinity and proton gradient energy are an attractive alternative with great energy potential.

TI Preparation of Yolk-Shell-Structured
   CoxFe1-xP with Enhanced OER
   Performance
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB The design and development of low-cost, highly efficient, and stable electrocatalysts to take the place of noble-metal catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain a significant challenge. Herein, the synthesis of yolk-shell-structured binary transition metal phosphide CoxFe1-xP with different Co/Fe ratios by phosphidation of a cobalt ferrite precursor is reported. The as-synthesized CoxFe1-xP catalysts were used for the OER. All yolk-shell CoxFe1-xP catalysts with different Co/Fe ratios showed much better performance than the corresponding solid catalyst. The formation of Co oxides on the catalyst surface during OER and the optimal Co/Fe ratio were found to be critical to their activity. Among the as-prepared CoxFe1-xP catalysts, that with a Co/Fe ratio of 0.47/0.53 (Co0.47Fe0.53P) exhibited the best performance. Co0.47Fe0.53P has an overpotential of 277 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1), and superior stability in alkaline medium. The outstanding performance is partly ascribed to the transfer of valence electrons from Co to P and Fe. The Co0.47Fe0.53P matrix with excellent conductivity and Fe phosphate that is stable on the surface of the catalyst are also helpful for the OER performance. In addition, the yolk-shell structure of Co0.47Fe0.53P increases the contact area between electrolyte and catalyst. These characteristics of Co0.47Fe0.53P greatly improve its OER performance. This optimized binary transition metal phosphide provides a new approach for the design of nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts.

TI Transition metal-based bimetallic MOFs and MOF-derived catalysts for
   electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical electrochemical reaction in water splitting and rechargeable metal-air batteries. It plays a pivotal role in achieving high-efficiency clean-energy production and energy storage in these devices. Transition metal-based bimetallic MOFs (TMB MOFs) with two different metal ions possess specific synergistic effects, which could exhibit OER performance and stability superior to those of the corresponding monometallic MOFs for water oxidation. Benefiting from the diversity of chemical composition and structural type, TMB MOFs can also serve as precursors and templates to obtain alloy-particle-decorated carbon materials with high surface area, or metal compounds such as bimetallic sulfides, phosphides, and hydroxides with atomic-level mixing of heterometallic elements. These materials with high-density active sites exhibit much improved catalytic activity in the water oxidation reaction. This article aims to review the recent progress with TMB MOFs and their derivatives in relation to applications as electrocatalysts in OER, including analysis of the mechanism of the OER process with the assistance of DFT calculations and in situ or operando techniques.

TI Mechanism orienting structure construction of electrodes for aqueous
   electrochemical energy storage systems: a review
SO NANOSCALE
AB Aqueous electrochemical energy storage systems (AEESS) are considered as the most promising energy storage devices for large-scale energy storage. AEESSs, including batteries and supercapacitors, have received extensive attention due to their low cost, eco-friendliness, and high safety. However, the insufficient energy densities of the state-of-the-art AEESSs limit their practical applications which are mainly dominated by the electrochemical performances of individual electrode materials. Understanding the underlying relationship between structures, reaction mechanisms, and performances can further lead to the design and optimization of structures of the electrodes instructively, thereby harvesting favorable performances. This review classified the intrinsic logic of structure-mechanism-performance by taking some prevailing mechanisms with some classical structures of materials as examples. Moreover, some problem-oriented structural engineering strategies are proposed aiming to optimize their performance. Finally, comprehensive structural design engineering and some suggestions for fine modifications of electrode materials at the atomic and molecular levels are proposed to combine the advantages of supercapacitor- and battery-type materials for designing excellent electrode materials for AEESSs.

Compound 3 is a neutral heterotrinuclear complex made up by two peripheral [Cr-III(AA)(CN)(4)](-) units acting as monodentate ligands through one of their cyanido groups towards an inner [Mn-II(pyim)(2)](2+) entity. Each manganese(II) ion in 3 is six-coordinate with two cyanido nitrogen atoms and two bidentate pyim molecules, building a distorted octahedral surrounding. The values of the Cr-III-Mn-II distance across the bridging cyanido ligand are 5.3766(7) (1), 5.3194(6) (2) and 5.3245(8) and 5.4538(7) A (3). The magnetic properties of 1-3 were investigated in the temperature range 1.9-300 K. Overall antiferro-magnetic behaviour is observed for all three compounds, with the antiparallel alignment of the local spins leading to either a ground-state spin triplet (1 and 2) or a spin doublet (3). The values of the magnetic coupling between the Cr-III and Mn-II ions across the single cyanido bridges are J = -7.40(2) (1), -6.65(2) (2) and -6.41(2) and -4.65(2) cm(-1) (3), with the spin Hamiltonian being defined as H = -J(S-Cr1 center dot S-Mn1) (1 and 2) and H = -J(1)(S-Cr1 center dot S-Mn1) - J(2)(S-Cr2 center dot S-Mn2) (3). These values could be cor-related with the Mn-N-C-cyanido angle, and they agree with those reported for this exchange pathway in other magneto-structural studies.

TI Tailored Assembly of Molecular Water Oxidation Catalysts on

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Solar-to-chemical energy conversion, or so-called artificial photosynthesis, is a promising technology enabling sustainable production and use of various chemical compounds such as H-2, CO, CH4, HCOOH, CH3OH, and NH3. For practical applications, it is necessary to improve the interfacial properties of light-harvesting semiconductors through modification with proper electrocatalysts, by trying to overcome their intrinsic limitations such as rapid recombination, sluggish reaction kinetics, and photocorrosion. Compared to their heterogeneous counterparts, molecular electrocatalysts have a higher catalytic activity and more flexibility in their design/synthesis and integration with semiconducting materials. In this article, we review recent efforts on the tailored assembly of molecular electrocatalysts to address the above issues for artificial photosynthesis, especially those for oxygen evolution reactions on semiconductor photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. One can expect that the strategies and methods developed for the tailored assembly and integration of molecular electrocatalysts on water oxidation photoanodes can provide insights for the design and fabrication of various forms of photosynthetic devices due to the similarity between their underlying principles.

SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging technology for removing charged ions from wastewater or aqueous solutions, where the charged ions interact electrostatically with the porous electrodes. Although recently, studies on CDI have increased significantly, the bulk of them is related to desalination (removing NaCl from water). So, it is highly recommended to highlight and discuss the CDI's capability to treat wastewater. This review summarizes the principles and application of CDI technology in wastewater treatment. The significant developments made on CDI for removing water containments such as radioactive minerals, heavy metals, nutrients, halides, hardness, and acids are highlighted. Then, CDI integrated or hybrid systems, such as co-precipitation, ultrafiltration, reverse electro-dialysis, electro deionization, and adsorption, for wastewater treatment and ion removal are reviewed and discussed. Finally, recommendations and future aspects for CDI development are presented.

TI 2023 roadmap for potassium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-ENERGY
AB The heavy reliance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has caused rising concerns on the sustainability of lithium and transition metal and the ethic issue around mining practice. Developing alternative energy storage technologies beyond lithium has become a prominent slice of global energy research portfolio. The alternative technologies play a vital role in shaping the future landscape of energy storage, from electrified mobility to the efficient utilization of renewable energies and further to large-scale stationary energy storage. Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are a promising alternative given its chemical and economic benefits, making a strong competitor to LIBs and sodium-ion batteries for different applications. However, many are unknown regarding potassium storage processes in materials and how it differs from lithium and sodium and understanding of solid-liquid interfacial chemistry is massively insufficient in PIBs. Therefore, there remain outstanding issues to advance the commercial prospects of the PIB technology. This Roadmap highlights the up-to-date scientific and technological advances and the insights into solving challenging issues to accelerate the development of PIBs. We hope this Roadmap aids the wider PIB research community and provides a cross-referencing to other beyond lithium energy storage technologies in the fast-pacing research landscape.

TI Two-electron redox-active tricyano iron(II) complex with
   2,4,6-tris(2-pyrimidyl)-1,3,5-triazine as a building block for
   coordination polymers
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB A new tricyano iron(ii) building unit, [{K(H2O)(4)}{Fe-II(CN)(3)(L)}]3H(2)O (1), was synthesized by the reaction of Moor's salts with 2,4,6-tris(2-pyrimidyl)-1,3,5-triazine (L) as a capping ligand. X-ray structural analysis reveals that the mononuclear iron(ii) tricyano complex consists of one ligand and three cyanide groups, with K+ ions coordinated between neighboring units to form a one-dimensional chain network structure. 1 shows two reversible redox waves at +0.713 and -0.849 V vs. SCE, which are assigned as Fe(ii)/Fe(iii) and L/L- processes, respectively. One-dimensional 4,2-ribbon chain type coordination polymers, [M-II(H2O)(2){Fe-II(CN)(3)(L)}(2)]6H(2)O (M = Fe (2) and Mn (3)), were synthesized by using 1 as a building unit. Cryomagnetic studies reveals that 2 and 3 show paramagnetic behaviour of S = 2 and 5/2, respectively. On the other hand, reaction of 1 and Gd(NO3)(3)6H(2)O forms another one-dimensional chain, [Gd-III(NO3)(2)(H2O)(3){Fe-II(CN)(3)(L)}]0.5H(2)O2CH(3)OH (4), showing S = 7/2 paramagnetic behaviour.

TI Cobalt Oxides with Various 3D Nanostructured Morphologies for Catalytic
   Reduction of 4-Nitrophenol: A Comparative Study
SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Catalytic reduction processes represent a promising approach to treat the toxic nitro-aromatic pollutant, 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), via converting 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP). Many efforts have been invested into developing non-precious metal oxides for the conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP. As Co3O4 is validated as a useful non-precious metal catalyst for 4-NP reduction, it is crucial to probe into the relationship of morphology-property-reactivity of Co3O4 catalysts for optimizing design of Co3O4 for 4-NP reduction. Thus, the catalytic activity of Co3O4 for 4-NP is particularly investigated in this study through examining 3-dimensional (3D) Co3O4 catalysts (3DCoOs) with different nanostructured morphologies, including the conical-Co3O4 (CCO), stacked-Co3O4 (SCO), needled-Co3O4 (NCO) and floral-Co3O4 (FCO), for 4-NP reduction. A remarkably enhanced activity in the reduction of 4-NP is realized over all 3DCoOs than commercial Co3O4 catalysts. In particular, CCO shows the highest catalytic performance (k =0.6882 min(-1) and E-a = 37.4 kJ mol(-1)), whereas FCO exhibits the least catalytic activity, with k =0.4709 min(-1) and E-a = 47.1 kJ mol(-1). These values are far more superior than those obtained by the commercial Co3O4 and the reported catalysts. All four 3DCoOs also show stable recyclability with complete 4-NP reduction over five successive cycles. These results and findings suggest that 3DCoOs are certainly advantageous Co-based catalysts for 4-NP reduction, and, through this study, the relationship between morphology, property and reactivity would be correlated to offer useful insights to design and apply 3D nanostructured Co3O4 catalysts for 4-NP reduction.

TI Challenges and future perspectives on sodium and potassium ion batteries
   for grid-scale energy storage
SO MATERIALS TODAY
AB The energy crisis and environmental pollution require the advancement of large-scale energy storage techniques. Among the various commercialized technologies, batteries have attracted enormous attention due to their relatively high energy density and long cycle life. Nevertheless, the limited supply and uneven distribution of lithium minerals, as well as their high cost, has greatly hindered the application of lithium-ion batteries in large-scale energy storage. Therefore, building next-generation alternative rechargeable batteries that feature low cost, long service life, and high safety is of the utmost importance. Over the past several years, we have witnessed many successful research outcomes for sodium and potassium ion batteries (SIBs and PIBs) in regard to electrode and electrolyte materials. In this Perspective, we summarize the current developments on SIBs/PIBs and their challenges when facing practical applications, including their cost, energy density, ion diffusivity in solids/electrolytes/interphases, cycle life, and safety concerns. Furthermore, we provide an overview of strategies to overcome the remaining challenges for achieving better electrochemical performance. Finally, we outline several possible directions for the future development of these two battery chemistries, with the hope of aiding the transition from the laboratory to next-generation practical applications for SIBs/PIBs batteries in grid-scale energy storage.

TI Nanoboxes endow non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts with high
   efficiency for overall water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB In order to solve the environmental and energy crises, it is urgent to develop cost-effective and advanced electrocatalysts for efficient overall water splitting. With the development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), non-noble-metal-based hollow nanoboxes have become one of the most promising candidate materials for heterogeneous electrocatalysts due to their unique structural features. In this review, we aim at providing an updated summary of the research related to hollow nanobox architectures, covering their classification, advantages, electrocatalytic applications and reaction mechanisms. Following a brief introduction, we review the recent progress in various advanced nanoboxes for electrocatalytic processes in the efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting (OWS). Then, we systemically discuss the relationship among the composition, morphology, structure, and catalytic activity, with an emphasis on the classification of nanoboxes, electrocatalytic performance and reaction mechanism. Later, the structural advantages and compositional merits for advanced electrocatalysis are also presented, including abundant surface active sites, facilitated electron/mass transport, and favorable synergistic effect and electronic effect. Finally, the current challenges, future perspectives, and research directions ahead for non-noble-metal-based nanoboxes as efficient electrocatalysts are also outlined.

   Clusters
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB The synthesized chiral (R)- and (S)-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)pyridine ligands (R/S-mpm) were introduced to self-assembled Co-II-[W-V(CN)(8)] and Ni-II-[W-V(CN)(8)] magnetic systems giving a remarkable series of four enantiopure cyanido-bridged clusters, {M-II[M-II(R/S-mpm)(MeOH)](8)[W-V(CN)(8)](6)}center dot 14MeOH (M = Co, 1-R and 1-S; M = Ni, 2-R and 2-S). They consist of 15, metal centers, 9 Co-II or Ni-II ions, and 6 [W-V(CN)(8)](3-) ions, embedded in a 6-capped body-centered cube topology. Bidentate enantiopure mpm ligands coordinated to eight external Co-II or Ni-II sites induce their chiral character, which results in the Strong natural optical activity in the broad UV-vis range of 200-700 nm. All (1-R/S) and (2-R/S) clusters reveal cyanido-mediated ferromagnetic exchange interaction giving high-spin ground states of 15/2 (1-R/S) and 12 (2-R/S). For (2-R/S) forms of {Ni9W6}, the exchange constant J = +16.1 cm(-1) was obtained using exact diagonalization of the exchange Hamiltonian. Because of the significant magnetic anisotropy, (1-R/S) forms of {Co9W6} duster reveal the low temperature onset of the slow magnetic relaxation characteristic of single-molecule magnets (SMMs). Thus, they can be considered as a rare example of chiral SMM molecules.

TI Routes to High Energy Cathodes of Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are now being actively developed as low cost and sustainable alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale electric energy storage applications. In recent years, various inorganic and organic Na compounds, mostly mimicked from their Li counterparts, have been synthesized and tested for SIBs, and some of them indeed demonstrate comparable specific capacity to the presently developed LIB electrodes. However, the lack of suitable cathode materials is still a major obstacle to the commercial development of SIBs. Here, we present a brief review on the recent developments of SIB cathodes, with a focus on low cost and high energy density materials (> 450 Wh kg(-1) vs Na) together with discussion of their Na-storage mechanisms. The considerable differences in the structural requirements for Li- and Na-storage reactions mean that it is not sufficient to design SIB cathode materials by simply mimicking LIB materials, and therefore great efforts are needed to discover new materials and reaction mechanisms to further develop variable cathodes for advanced SIB technology. Some directions for future research and possible strategies for building advanced cathode materials are also proposed here.

SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB The cyanidocobaltate of formula fac-PPh4[Co-III((Me2)Tp)(CN)(3)]center dot CH3CN (1) has been used as a metalloligand to prepare polynuclear magnetic complexes ((Me2)Tp= hydrotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)borate). The association of 1 with in situ prepared [Fe-II(bik)(2)(MeCN)(2)](OTf)(2) (bik= bis(1methylimidazol-2-yl)ketone) leads to a molecular square of formula {[Co-III{((Me2)Tp)}(CN)(3)](2)[Fe-II(bik)(2)](2)}(OTf)(2).4MeCN center dot 2H(2)O (2), whereas the self-assembly of 1 with preformed cluster [Co-2(II)(OH2)(piv)(4)(Hpiv)(4)] in MeCN leads to the two-dimensional network of formula {[Co-2(II)(piv)(3)](2)[CoIII((Me2)Tp)(CN)(3)](2) center dot 2CH(3)CN}(infinity) (3). These compounds were structurally characterized via single crystal X-ray analysis and their spectroscopic (FTIR, UVVis and Co-59 NMR) properties and magnetic behaviours were also investigated. Bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that 1 is diamagnetic and 3 is paramagnetic through-out the explored temperature range, whereas 2 exhibits sharp spin transition centered at ca. 292 K. Compound 2 also exhibits photomagnetic effects at low temperature, selective light irradiations allowing to promote reversibly and repeatedly low-spin.high-spin conversion. Besides, the diamagnetic nature of the Co(III) building block allows us studying these compounds by means of Co-59 NMR spectroscopy. Herein, a Co-59 chemical shift has been used as a magnetic probe to corroborate experimental magnetic data obtained from bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements. An influence of the magnetic state of the neighbouring atoms is observed on the Co-59 NMR signals. Moreover, for the very first time, Co-59 NMR technique has been successfully introduced to investigate molecular materials with distinct magnetic properties.

TI High-Performance Cathode Materials for Potassium-Ion Batteries:
   Structural Design and Electrochemical Properties
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Due to the obvious advantage in potassium reserves, potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention as an alternative energy storage system for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the large size of K+ makes it a challenging task to identify suitable electrode materials, particularly cathode ones that determine the energy density of PIBs, capable of tolerating the serious structural deformation during the continuous intercalation/deintercalation of K+. It is therefore of paramount importance that proper design principles of cathode materials be followed to ensure stable electrochemical performance if a practical application of PIBs is expected. Herein, the current knowledge on the structural engineering of cathode materials acquired during the battle against its performance degradation is summarized. The K+ storage behavior of different types of cathodes is discussed in detail and the structure-performance relationship of materials sensitive to their different lattice frameworks is highlighted. The key issues facing the future development of different categories of cathode materials are also highlighted and perspectives for potential approaches and strategies to promote the further development of PIBs are provided.

TI A method to calculate the NMR spectra of paramagnetic species using
   thermalized electronic relaxation
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE
AB For paramagnetic species, it has been long understood that the hyperfine interaction between the unpaired electrons and the nucleus results in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) peak that is shifted by a paramagnetic shift, rather than split by the coupling, due to an averaging of the electronic magnetic moment caused by electronic relaxation that is fast in comparison to the hyperfine coupling constant. However, although this feature of paramagnetic NMR has formed the basis of all theories of the param-agnetic shift, the precise theory and mechanism of the electronic relaxation required to predict this result has never been discussed, nor has the assertion been tested. In this paper, we show that the standard semi-classical Redfield theory of relaxation fails to predict a paramagnetic shift, as does any attempt to correct for the semi-classical theory using modifications such as the inhomogeneous master equation or Levitt-di Bari thermalization. In fact, only the recently-introduced Lindbladian theory of relaxation in magnetic resonance [J. Magn. Reson., 310, 106645 (2019)] is able to correctly predict the paramagnetic shift tensor and relaxation-induced linewidth in pNMR. Furthermore, this new formalism is able to pre-dict the NMR spectra of paramagnetic species outside the high-temperature and weak-order limits, and is therefore also applicable to dynamic nuclear polarization. The formalism is tested by simulations of five case studies, which include Fermi-contact and spin-dipolar hyperfine couplings, g-anisotropy, zero-field splitting, high and low temperatures, and fast and slow electronic relaxation.

TI Charge and Spin-State Characterization of Cobalt Bis(o-dioxolene)
   Valence Tautomers Using Co Kβ X-ray Emission and L-Edge X-ray Absorption
   Spectroscopies
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The valence tautomeric stated of Co(phen)-(3,5-DBQ)(2) and co(tmeda)(3,5-DBQ)(2), where 3,5-DBQ is either the semiquinone (SQ(-)) or catecholate (Cat(2-)) form of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone, have been examined by a series of cobalt-specific X-ray spectroscopies. In this work, we have utilized the sensitivity of 1s3p X-ray emission Spectroscopy (K beta XES) to the oxidation and spin states of 3d transition-metal ions to determine the cobalt-specific electronic structure of valence tautomers. A comparison of their K beta XES spectra with the spectra of cobalt coordination complexes with known oxidation and spin states demonstrates that the low-temperature valence tautomer can be described as a low-spin Co-III configuration and the high-temperature valence tautomer as a high-spin Co-II configuration. This conclusion is further supported by L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (L-edge XAS) of the high-temperature Valence tautomers and ligand-field atomic-multiplet calculations of the K beta XES and L-edge XAS spectra. The nature and strength of the magnetic exchange interaction between the cobalt center and SQ(-) in cobalt valence tautomers is discussed: in view of the effective spin at the Co site from K beta XES and the molecular spin moment from magnetic susceptibility measurements.

TI Designing Self-Supported Metal-Organic Framework Derived Catalysts for
   Electrochemical Water Splitting
SO CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL
AB To achieve efficient water splitting, it is essential to develop catalysts with high electrochemical performance, enhanced durability and tunable properties. Most of the transition metal-based catalysts employed for the water splitting have been fabricated on the solid-electrode support by using binder, which decreases the activity and durability of the catalyst system. In this respect, self-supported metal organic framework (MOF) derived catalysts have been introduced with enhanced catalytic activity and mechanical stability for the electrochemical water splitting. The self-supported MOF derived catalysts exhibit improved electronic conductivity, high electrochemical surface area, enhanced mechanical stability and strong catalyst-support interaction. Moreover, these catalysts possess highly porous and hollow structure with designed morphology and multi-metallic composition. Recently, a tremendous effort has been provided to explore this newly growing field and new dimensions and directions have been achieved. Looking at this point, we have described here the basic principles of catalyst design from self-supported MOF, structural and interface engineering by controlling the electronic structure of the catalysts to improve the water splitting activity. In addition, the challenges and difficulties associated with this field have been pointed out and addressed for the future progress in this field.

TI Modulating electronic structure of metal-organic framework derived
   catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Oxygen evolution reaction plays the role of a bottleneck in the electrochemical water splitting. The production of high current density at low overpotential and long-time durability of the catalysts are the main challenges to achieve further progress in this field. In this respect, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a new route for the designing of the catalysts with excellent electrochemical water oxidation activity. MOF derived materials have been demonstrated with high surface area, porous structure, increased electron transport, accessible active sites, and tailorable properties. Recent studies of MOF derived electrocatalysts mainly focused on the morphological development, crystal structure modulation, facet engineering, and enhancement of the electrochemical surface area. The recent reviews also followed the same trend to explain the improved water oxidation activity of the MOF derived catalysts. As a result, electronic structure, the major descriptor of the water oxidation activity, was never reviewed for the MOF derived electrocatalysts. Hence a systematic discussion for the designing of the MOF-derived electrocatalysts by electronic structure modulation is highly demanded. In this review, we have described the electronic structure engineering of the MOF derived materials to attain efficient water oxidation activity. The controlling factors like e(g) orbital filling, metal-oxygen covalency, mixed valency of metal ions, octahedral (Oh) vs tetrahedral (Td) occupancy of the metal ions, and vacancy engineering have been discussed. The strategies of tuning the electronic properties by interfacial modulation, surface overlayer, Fermi level manipulation, self-supported strategy, and heterostructure formation have also been addressed to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the MOF derived catalysts. Finally, an attempt has been made to establish a structure-activity-stability relationship in MOF derived materials for the electrochemical water oxidation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Magnetic features of a mixed ferro-ferrimagnetic ternary alloy
   cylindrical nanowire
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In the present study, we have investigated the finite temperature magnetic phase transition properties of a mixed ferro-ferrimagnetic ternary alloy cylindrical nanowire of the type AB(p)C(1-p) by Monte Carlo simulation technique. The nanowire system consists of two interpenetrating sublattices, one of which contains type-A magnetic components with spin-3/2 and the other one is randomly occupied type-B and type-C magnetic components with spin-1 and spin-5/2, respectively. We have examined the effect of exchange interaction ratio, R, and the, concentration value of type-B magnetic ions, p, on the transition temperature of the system. It has been found that one can modify the transition temperature and saturation magnetization of the system by varying concentration value and interaction ratio. Moreover, our numerical results show that the ternary alloy nanowire system exhibits compensation behavior for particular values of the system parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI In situ characterizations of advanced electrode materials for sodium-ion
   batteries toward high electrochemical performances
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Energy storage is an ever-growing global concern due to increased energy needs and resource exhaustion. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have called increasing attention and achieved substantial progress in recent years owing to the abundance and even distribution of Na resources in the crust, and the predicted low cost of the technique. Nevertheless, SIBs still face challenges like lower energy density and inferior cycling stability compared to mature lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Enhancing the electrochemical perfor-mance of SIBs requires an in-deep and comprehensive understanding of the improvement strategies and the underlying reaction mechanism elucidated by in situ techniques. In this review, commonly applied in situ techniques, for instance, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and their applications on the rep-resentative cathode and anode materials with selected samples are summarized. We discuss the merits and demerits of each type of material, strategies to enhance their electrochemical performance, and the applications of in situ characterizations of them during the de/sodiation process to reveal the underlying reaction mechanism for performance improvement. We aim to elucidate the composition/structure-per formance relationship to provide guidelines for rational design and preparation of electrode materials toward high electrochemical performance.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI Recent Advances on Bimetallic Transition Metal Phosphides for Enhanced
   Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB Developing excellent electrocatalysts to replace noble metal catalysts and improve hydrogen production via water splitting is a daunting task. Bimetallic transition metal phosphides (TMPs) display improved performance than monometallic transition metal phosphides due to their synergistic effects. Moreover, research has proven that supporting them on conductive substrates can further enhance their electrochemical performance. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are incorporated into bimetallic TMPs for enhanced performance. This review starts with a synopsis of the reaction mechanisms and performance parameters of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Moreover, the strategies for enhancing the performance of bimetallic TMPs and improving the hydrophilicity of TMPs are also discussed. In conclusion, the challenges and perspectives of bimetallic transition metal phosphides are discussed. This review analyses the extensive progress in this research domain and proffers insights that can aptly guide the future development of more excellent TMPs and other transition metal electrocatalysts for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction.

TI Realizing electrochemical transformation of a metal-organic framework
   precatalyst into a metal hydroxide-oxy(hydroxide) active catalyst during
   alkaline water oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The facile and cost-effective designing of electrocatalysts still remains a challenge for electrochemical water oxidation. In the last three decades, a series of earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been explored for electrochemical water oxidation. In this regard, metal-organic framework (MOF) derived catalysts (metal oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides, etc.) with various compositions, desired morphologies, high porosity, large electrochemical surface areas, and tunable properties have been explored for electrochemical water oxidation. MOF-derived catalysts produce excellent electrochemical water oxidation activity in alkaline medium. However, the direct utilization of MOFs for anodic water oxidation has been overlooked for a long time due to their poor stability under electrochemical conditions. Recently, the instability of MOFs has been successfully utilized to produce ultrathin metal hydroxide-(oxy)hydroxide [M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y)] nanosheets by electrochemical transformation. The MOF plays the role of a precatalyst and undergoes a series of structural reconstructions like hydrolysis, metal ion leaching, oxidation of the metal ions during alkaline anodic water oxidation and forms the active catalyst M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y). The electrochemically synthesized ultrathin nanosheets demonstrate excellent water oxidation activity and stability because of their atomic-level thickness, large electrochemical surface area, optimum inter-layer distance, and tuned electronic structure. Recently, this strategy has been explored to attain high-quality ultrathin M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets for water oxidation. Although tremendous progress has been made in using MOFs as a precatalyst for electrochemical water oxidation, no dedicated review is available in this field. Looking at this point, this review describes a strategy of designing ultrathin M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets by the electrochemical transformation of MOFs, the structural and electronic structure modulation of the ultrathin M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets, morphological development and their application for electrochemical water oxidation. Moreover, the structure-activity-stability relationship has been established with suitable examples and the recent progress and challenges have also been addressed focusing on the future perspective in this field.

TI Cyanide-Bridged Fe-Co Polynuclear Clusters Based on Four-Coordinate
   Cobalt(II)
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Treatment of CoCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and tris(pyrazolyl-1-yl)borate tricyanoiron(III) anions at 55 degrees C afforded a series of new Fe-Co polynuclear clusters: {Co,Cl-2 (DMF)(4)[(Tp(4-Me)) Fe(CN)(3)](2)} (1; Tp(4-Me) = hydridotris(4-methylpyrazol-1-yl) borate), (H3O+)@{Co4Cl4 [(Tp(4-Me))Fe(CN)(3)](4)} (2), (MePh3P)(4){Co6Cl6[(Tp(4-Me))Fe(CN)(3)](6)}center dot 15CH(3)CN center dot 3CH(3)OH center dot 2H(2)O (3), and (BnEt3N)(4){Co5Cl8[(Tp*)Fe(CN)(3)](4)}center dot 4CH(3)CN center dot 2H(2)O (4; Tp*= hydridotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)borate). They feature an asymmetric [Fe2Co2(CN)(4)] square, a pseudocubic [Fe4Co4(CN)(12)] cluster, a distorted-hexagonal-prism-shaped [Fe6Co6(CN)(18)] cage, and a bis(trigonal-bipyramidal) cluster of [Fe4Co5(CN)(12)] fused at one cobalt center, respectively. The Co(II) ions adopt a four-coordinate tetrahedral geometry except for half of 1 in an octahedral geometry. It should be mentioned that 3 and 4 provide two novel molecular skeletons in the cyanometalate family. Interestingly, 1 behaved as a single-molecule magnet with an effective energy barrier for spin reverse of 30.7 K at zero dc field. Our result demonstrated a possible self-assembly route toward high-nuclearity cyanide-bridged clusters by introducing four-coordinate cobalt(II) ions.

TI Coordination nanoarchitectonics at interfaces between supramolecular and
   materials chemistry
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB In this review, we briefly introduce recent progresses related to material construction with coordination as a structure-directing driving force based on two concepts: nanoarchitectonics and interfacial processes as well as their conversion into functional nanoporous materials. Nanoarchitectonics aims to architect functional materials and advanced systems from nanometer-scale units and building blocks on the basis of the harmonization of various actions and events. Although coordination has several advantages due to highly directional interactions, exchangeable components, and a multivalent nature, the utilization of coordination chemistry in nanoarchitectonics has not been yet well recognized in current science and technology. Another interesting feature is the interfacial effect added to coordination nanoarchitectonics because interfacial low-dimensional structures often become suitable media to bridge nanoscale phenomena and macroscopic three-dimensional (3D) structures. Indeed, coordination materials with anisotropic and directional properties can be well-created through interfacial processes. Herein, we summarize recent activities in the field of coordination-chemistry-driven materials science, mainly including coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks, to make readers aware of the deep relation between coordination chemistry and nanoarchitectonics. In addition, we also report in the last section recent examples on the conversion of these coordination structures into novel nanostructured materials in order to connect coordination nanoarchitectonics with useful applications.

Materials containing bothFe and Mn, the two most abundant metal elements, have been widelyused for wastewater decontamination since they are nontoxic, low-cost,easy to prepare, and highly efficient. This review systematicallysummarizes the synthesis methods of Fe-Mn-based unloaded materials(such as spinel-type, perovskite-type, layered double hydroxides,metal-organic framework, and its derivatives) and loaded materials(carbon materials, oxides, and other loaded materials). Furthermore,the progress and problems of the application of Fe-Mn-basedmaterials in the fields of Fenton, photo-Fenton, electro-Fenton, persulfate,and sulfite catalysis processes are analyzed. Different activationmechanisms of Fe-Mn-based materials, such as radical pathwaysand nonradical pathways (like direct electron transfer pathways, singletoxygen, and high valence metals, etc.) are described. Finally, theapplication potential of Fe-Mn-based materials in environmentalremediation is clarified and the future research directions are pointedout. It is expected that this review can provide new inspiration forsubsequent research on the application of Fe-Mn based materialsfor wastewater treatment.

TI Porous Hexacyanometallate(III) Complexes as Catalysts in the
   Ring-Opening Copolymerization of CO2 and Propylene Oxide
SO CATALYSTS
AB In this work, six porous hexacyanometallate complexes (Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2), Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2), Fe-3[Co(CN)(6)](2), Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), Fe-4[Fe(CN)(6)](2)) were synthesized by a complexing agent assisted coprecipitation method and thoroughly characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD), elemental analysis (EA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 physisorption, and gas-solid phase titration with NH3. The thermal stability, chemical composition, pore size and volume, crystallite size and density of surface acid sites were strongly sensitive to both the transition metal and the cyanometallate anion employed. On that basis, transition metal hexacyanometallates must be perceived as an adaptable class of zeolite-like microporous materials. The catalytic properties of these compounds were tested by copolymerization of propylene oxide and CO2, a green route to obtain biodegradable aliphatic polycarbonates. All compounds under study showed moderate activity in the target reaction. The obtained copolymers were characterized by modest CO2 content (carbonate units ranging from 16 to 33%), random structure (R-PEC approximate to 70%), and moderate molecular weight (M-w = 6000-85,400 g/mol) with broad dispersity values (D-M = 4.1-15.8).

TI Advanced electrode materials for nonaqueous calcium rechargeable
   batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Calcium (Ca)-based rechargeable batteries (CRBs) have been considered one of the most promising post-lithium ion battery technologies because of the natural abundance of Ca, high volumetric capacity compared to monovalent metal batteries, and the low reduction potential of Ca2+/Ca. Recently, a breakthrough of Ca reversible plating and stripping at the Ca metal anode in carbonate electrolytes has induced the study of Ca rechargeable batteries. This critical review presents the state-of-the-art progress made in exploring potential electrode materials including Ca metal anodes, alternative graphite and alloy-type anodes, and cathode materials undergoing interaction or conversion reactions. Suitable electrolytes are also required to ensure the compatibility of each cell component, which is essential toward high-performance Ca full batteries. The performance assessment and mechanism analysis are further discussed to evaluate the current progress and existing challenges regarding the performance promise and insufficient understanding of the Ca battery technology. To conclude, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and challenges that need to be addressed to promote the commercialization of CRBs.

TI Control of the Speed of a Light-Induced Spin Transition through
   Mesoscale Core-Shell Architecture
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The rate of the light-induced spin transition in a coordination polymer network solid dramatically increases when included as the core in mesoscale core-shell particles. A series of photomagnetic coordination polymer core-shell heterostructures, based on the light-switchable RbaCob[Fe(CN)(6)](c)center dot mH(2)O (RbCoFe-PBA) as core with the isostructural KjNik[Cr(CN)(6)](l)center dot H2O (KNiCr-PBA) as shell, are studied using temperature dependent powder X-ray diffraction and SQUID magnetometry. The core RbCoFe-PBA exhibits a charge transfer-induced spin transition (CTIST), which can be thermally and optically induced. When coupled to the shell, the rate of the optically induced transition from low spin to high spin increases. Isothermal relaxation from the optically induced high spin state of the core back to the low spin state and activation energies associated with the transition between these states were measured. The presence of a shell decreases the activation energy, which is associated with the elastic properties of the core. Numerical simulations using an electro-elastic model for the spin transition in core shell particles supports the findings, demonstrating how coupling of the core to the shell changes the elastic properties of the system. The ability to tune the rate of optically induced magnetic and structural phase transitions through control of mesoscale architecture presents a new approach to the development of photoswitchable materials with tailored properties.

TI Hofmann-Type Cyanide Bridged Coordination Polymers for Advanced
   Functional Nanomaterials
SO SMALL
AB Since the discovery of Hofmann clathrates of inorganic cyanide bridged coordination polymers (Hofmann-type CN-CPs), extensive research is done to understand their behavior during spin transitions caused by guest molecules or external stimuli. Lately, research on their nanoscale architectures for sensors and switching devices is of interest. Their potential is reported for producing advanced functional inorganic materials in two-dimensional (2D) morphology using a scalable solid-state thermal treatment method. For instance, but not restricted to, alloys, carbides, chalcogenides, oxides, etc. Simultaneously, their in situ crystallization at graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet surfaces, followed by a subsequent self-assembly to build layered lamellar structures, is reported providing hybrid materials with a variety of uses. Hence, an overview of the most recent developments is presented here in the synthesis of nanoscale structures, including thin films and powders, using Hofmann-type CN-CPs. Also thoroughly demonstrated are the most recent synthetic ideas with the modest control over the size and shape of nanoscale particles. Additionally, in order to create new functional hybrid materials for electrical and energy applications, their thermal decomposition in various environments and hybridization with GO and other guest molecules is examined. This review article also conveyed their spin transition, astounding innovative versatile adhesives, and structure features.

TI Recent progress of functional metal-organic framework materials for
   water treatment using sulfate radicals
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Human health is being threatened by the ever-increasing water pollution. Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) are rapidly being developed and gaining considerable attention due to their high oxidation potential and selectivity as a way to purify water by degrading organic contaminants in it. Among the catalytic materials that can activate the precursor to generate SO4 center dot-, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are the most promising heterogeneous catalytic material in SR-AOPs because of their various structure possibilities, large surface area, ordered porous structure, and regular activation sites. Herein, an in-depth overview of MOFs and their derivatives for water purification with SR-AOPs is provided. The latest studies on pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and MOF derivatives (metal oxides, metal-carbon hybrids, and carbon materials) are summarized. The mechanisms of decomposition of pollutants in water via radical and non-radical pathways are also discussed. This review suggests future research directions for water purification through MOF-based SR-AOP.

TI Advances in design of metal-organic frameworks activating persulfate for
   water decontamination
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a type of extended crystalline porous materials, built from organic linkers and metal ions as centers via coordination interaction, have drawn ever-growing concerns in diversiform fields because of their large surface area, high porosity, and tailorable structure. Taking account of the serious water pollution, persulfate-based advanced oxidation technologies (PS-AOTs), as the essential strategy for wastewater treatments, have attracted more attention in recent years, which allow the transformation of chemical pollutants from different sources into less toxic and more readily biodegradable substances by oxidation and mineralization. The efficiency of the oxidation processes could be crucially improved by using appropriate MOFs. In this review, we summarize the strategies for rationally designing MOF-related materials as very efficient PS activators for the prominent elimination of organic contaminants through (i) tailoring compositions and structures of MOF-related catalysts to increase the number of active sites, enhance the electron transfer capacity and promote the surface properties; (ii) researching effects of environmental factors on catalytic performance and corresponding mechanisms to alleviate the negative influences; and (iii) balancing the contribution of different catalytic pathways (free radical and non-radical pathways) to realize better catalytic performance. Finally, we propose possible future directions for the design of MOF-related catalysts as PS activators based on the degradation mechanism, reusability, and toxicity. Additionally, due to the promising potential of MOFs for the elimination of arsenic compounds from water, the successive As(III) oxidation and by-produced As(V) adsorption in PS-AOTs by MOF-related materials were encouraged. These strategies could advance the future design of MOF-related catalysts as PS activators toward water decontamination. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO SMALL
AB With the ever-growing environmental issues, sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) have been attracting widespread attention due to their high selectivity and oxidative potential in water purification. Among various methods generating SO4 center dot-, employing heterogeneous catalysts for activation of peroxymonosulfate or persulfate has been demonstrated as an effective strategy. Therefore, the future advances of SR-AOPs depend on the development of adequate catalysts with high activity and stability. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with large surface area, ultrahigh porosity, and diversity of material design have been extensively used in heterogeneous catalysts, and more recently, enormous effort has been made to utilize MOFs-based materials for SR-AOPs applications. In this work, the state-of-the-art research on pristine MOFs, MOFs composites, and their derivatives, such as oxides, metal/carbon hybrids, and carbon materials for SR-AOPs, is summarized. The mechanisms, including radical and nonradical pathways, are also detailed in the discussion. This work will hopefully promote the future development of MOFs-based materials toward SR-AOPs applications.

TI Review on Cathode Materials for Sodium- and Potassium-Ion Batteries:
   Structural Design with Electrochemical Properties
SO BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS
AB As a promising candidates for next-generation secondary battery system, sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries and potassium-ion (K-ion) batteries are recently attracting considerable attention because of their cost-effectiveness and similar reaction mechanism to that of lithium-ion batteries. However, the major challenges for their practical application are sluggish ionic kinetic with excessive volume change of the cathode material, caused by larger ionic radius than Li+ ion. The current demand for high energy density is not satisfactory with the electrochemical properties of the cathode materials for Na-ion and K-ion batteries studied so far, but extensive studies have been conducted to achieve large reversible capacity, high power capacity, and long life in recent years. This review provides comprehensive information on the cathode material studies reported to date for Na-ion and K-ion batteries, with a particular focus on the various strategies of each cathode material to achieve high electrochemical properties. In this regard, diverse electrochemical properties of cathode materials for Na-ion and K-ion batteries are compared with current Li-ion battery systems, and future research directions are discussed along with related challenges and prospects.

TI Emerging high-entropy strategy: A booster to the development of cathode
   materials for power batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED CERAMICS
AB The coordinated development of new energy vehicles and the energy storage industry has become essential for reducing carbon emissions. The cathode material is the key material that determines the energy density and cost of a power battery, but currently developed and applied cathode materials cannot meet the requirements for high specific capacity, low cost, safety, and good stability. High-entropy materials (HEMs) are a new type of single-phase material composed of multiple principal elements in equimolar or near-equimolar ratios. The interaction between multiple elements can play an important role in improving the comprehensive properties of the material, which is expected to solve the limitations of battery materials in practical applications. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current development status and modification strategies of power batteries (lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs)), proposes a high-entropy design strategy, and analyses the structure-activity relationship between the high-entropy effects and battery performance. Finally, future research topics related to high-entropy cathode materials, including computational guide design, specific synthesis methods, high-entropy electrochemistry, and high-throughput databases, are proposed. This review aims to provide practical guidance for the development of high-entropy cathode materials for next-generation power batteries.

TI Recent progress of emerging cathode materials for sodium ion batteries
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Recently, due to the excessive consumption of fossil energy and the intermittent nature of clean energy resources, electricity storage has attracted great attention from both academia and industry. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density have been widely used for portable energy storage systems. However, limited lithium resources cannot meet the demands for large-scale applications, especially the grid-scale energy storage. Owing to the abundant natural resources of sodium and the low price, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have become potential substitutes for LIBs. Cathode materials are key components that determine the overall performance and entire cost of SIBs. However, the unstable structure and limited electrochemical performance make them difficult to meet the requirement of practical applications. This review summarizes the recent development of the cathode materials used for SIBs, and the modified strategies applied to improve their electrochemical performance. Finally, critical challenges and perspectives to promote the development of SIBs are also presented.

TI Recent Advances in MOF-Based Materials for Remediation of Heavy Metals
   and Organic Pollutants: Insights into Performance, Mechanisms, and
   Future Opportunities
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In recent years, heavy metals and organic pollutants have become two major obstacles to maintaining the ecological environment. Thus, choosing efficient and environmentally friendly methods and materials to remediate heavy metals and organic pollution has become a hot research topic. Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites or derivatives can be used as ideal adsorbents and catalytic materials because of their unique structures and functions. This work reviews the research progress on MOF-based materials in the remediation of the water environment in the past decade. The MOF-based materials discussed here mainly include MOF composites obtained by fabrication and MOF derivatives obtained by pyrolysis. Both MOF composites and MOF derivatives are optimized materials that exhibit adsorption or catalytic performance superior to the pristine MOFs. Additionally, the interactions and mechanisms between the MOF-based materials and different heavy metals or organic pollutants are discussed in detail. Finally, some problems or defects of the MOF-based materials are also proposed considering the materials' economic efficiency, stability and safety. There is still a long way forward for the real application of MOF-based materials. Further efforts are also needed to explore and expand the environmental remediation scope of MOF-based materials.

TI Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur tri-doped hollow carbon shells derived
   from ZIF-67@poly (cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol) as a
   robust catalyst of peroxymonosulfate activation for degradation of
   bisphenol A
SO CARBON
AB Heteroatom-doped carbon materials have emerged as attractive catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation and environment remediation recently due to its low cost and non-toxicity. In this study, novel N, P, and S tri-doped hollow carbon shells (NPSC) are elaborately fabricated using ZIF-67 and poly (cyclotriphosphazeneeco-4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS) as precursors. NPSC obtained at 700 degrees C shows better performance than those at other temperature (600 and 800 degrees C), and it can effectively degrade 90.1% of Bisphenol A (BPA) in the presence of PMS, which totally exceeds the performance of several common catalysts. It is found that for used catalyst, surface oxidation of carbon networks and blockage of heteroatom-doping active sites are two main reasons for the deterioration of reusability. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and radical quenching tests are conducted to reveal that hydroxyl, sulfate, and superoxide radicals are main reactive species for BPA degradation in NPSC/PMS systems. Finally, it is proposed that synergistic effects of N, P, and S doping may greatly break the electroneutrality of pristine carbon structures, promote the O-O breakage of PMS, and facilitate the generation of radicals. Such findings dedicate to enlighten new thoughts and deeper understanding for synthesis of heteroatom-doped porous carbon in PMS activation. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Probing the Local Magnetic Structure of the
   [Fe<SUP>III</SUP>(Tp)(CN)3]<SUP>-</SUP> Building Block Via
   Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy, Polarized Neutron Diffraction, and
   First-Principle Calculations
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB The local magnetic structure in the [Fe-III(Tp)(CN)(3)](-) building block was investigated by combining paramagnetic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (pNMR) spectroscopy and polarized neutron diffraction (PND) with first-principle calculations. The use of the pNMR and PND experimental techniques revealed the extension of spin-density from the metal to the ligands, as well as the different spin mechanisms that take place in the cyanido ligands: Spin-polarization on the carbon atoms and spin-delocalization on the nitrogen atoms. The results of our combined density functional theory (DFT) and multireference calculations were found in good agreement with the PND results and the experimental NMR chemical shifts. Moreover, the ab-initio calculations allowed us to connect the experimental spin-density map characterized by PND and the suggested distribution of the spin-density on the ligands observed by NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, significant differences were observed between the pseudo-contact contributions of the chemical shifts obtained by theoretical calculations and the values derived from NMR spectroscopy using a simple point-dipole model. These discrepancies underline the limitation of the point-dipole model and the need for more elaborate approaches to break down the experimental pNMR chemical shifts into contact and pseudo-contact contributions.

TI Iron-based phosphides as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution
   reaction: recent advances and future prospects
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Electrochemical water splitting is the most promising process to produce carbon-neutral hydrogen as an energy carrier, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are essential to reduce the energy barrier and improve hydrogen production efficiency. This driving force necessitates the design of HER electrocatalysts with low-cost, high-abundance, high activity and stability. In this review, we systemically summarize recent publications with critical insight into the advances of iron-based phosphides as HER electrocatalysts. Various synthesis strategies corresponding to different phosphating strategies for guiding iron phosphide design are described, followed by illustrations of how to boost FeP HER catalytic performance by enriching the accessible active sites and modifying the electronic structure. Finally, we point out several challenges and prospects, which can open up opportunities to design next-generation FeP HER electrocatalysts.

TI Design and application of metal-organic frameworks and derivatives as
   heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts for organic wastewater treatment: A
   review
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Advanced oxidation process (AOP), with a high oxidation efficiency, fast reaction speed (relatively no secondary pollution), has become one of the core technologies of industrial wastewater and advanced drinking water treatment. Heterogeneous Fenton-like oxidation process (HFOP) is a kind of AOP, which developed rapidly in recent years in such a way to overcome the disadvantages of traditional Fenton reaction. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives become essential heterogeneous catalysts for organics mineralization due to the large specific surface area, abundant active sites, and ease of structural regulation. However, the knowledge gap on the mechanism and the fate of heterogeneous catalyst species during organics degradation activities by MOFs presents considerable impediments, particularly for a wide application and scaling up the process. This work has the potential to provide guidance and ideas for researchers and engineers in the fields of environmental remediation, environmental catalysis and functional materials. This review focuses on clarifying the critical mechanism of center dot OH production from MOFs and derivatives as well as its action on the organic's degradation process. The recent developments in MOF based HFOP are compared, and more attention is paid for the following aspects in this review: (1) classifies systematically progressive modification methods of MOFs by chemical and physical treatments; (2) analyzes the fate of catalytic species during treating organic wastewater; (3) proposes design ideas and principles for improving the performance of MOFs catalysts; (4) discusses the main factors influencing the catalytic properties and practical application; (5) summarizes the possible research challenges and directions for MOFs and their derivatives as catalysts applied to wastewater treatment in the future.

   chalcocyanide clusters exhibiting unusually long-lived photoluminescence
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB First examples of Ag(I)-containing coordination polymers based on octahedral rhenium(III) chalcocyanide clusters, namely [{Ag(bpy)}{Ag-4(bpy)(4)(mu-CN)}{Re(6)Q(8)(CN)(6)}] (Q = S in 1 or Se in 2; bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine), have been hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental and thermogravimetric analysis, EDS, IR and luminescence spectroscopy. The compounds are isostructural, crystallize in the orthorhombic system (space group Pccn, Z = 4) and possess a rigid 3D framework structure built up from {Re(6)Q(8)(CN)(6)}(4-) cluster anions and two distinct types of Ag(I)-containing cationic units, mononuclear {Ag(bpy)}(+) and tetranuclear tAg(4)(bpy)(4)(mu-CN))(3+), all of which are interconnected through cyanide bridging. The supramolecular structures of 1 and 2 are supported by argentophilic Ag center dot center dot center dot Ag interactions, but surprisingly show very limited pi-pi stacking of the pyridine rings. Both compounds are highly emissive in red region showing the longest lifetimes hitherto reported for the solid samples of hexarhenium cluster compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They combine the advantages of multivalent metal ion batteries (e.g., zinc-ion batteries, magnesium-ion batteries, and aluminum-ion batteries) with those of supercapacitors, and are characterized by good rate capability, high energy density, high power output and ultralong cycle life. Herein, after a brief introduction to supercapacitors and multivalent metal ion batteries, we reviewed the recent progress in research on multivalent metal ion hybrid capacitors, with a focus on zinc-ion hybrid capacitors, from the perspectives of design concept, configuration, electrochemical behavior and energy storage mechanism. An outlook of the future research regarding multivalent metal ion hybrid capacitors was also presented. This review will be beneficial for researchers around the world to have a better understanding of multivalent metal ion hybrid capacitors and develop novel electrochemical energy storage systems to meet the demands of rapidly developing electric vehicles and wearable/portable electronic products.

   capacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Metal ion hybrid capacitors (MIHCs) integrate both capacitive and battery-type electrodes, thereby merging the benefits of metal ion batteries (MIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs). Despite these advantages, the current performance of MIHCs is limited by the disparity in specific capacity and rate capability between the cathode and anode materials. This underscores the importance of electrode materials, which portray a critical function in the overall performance of MIHCs. To overcome these challenges, it is crucial to focus on the electrochemical properties of these materials and investigate approaches to improve their performance. This article begins by outlining the types, composition, and energy storage processes of MIHCs. It then reviews the electrode materials employed in LIHCs, SIHCs, PIHCs, and ZIHCs, highlighting their properties and their impact on electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the review delves into efficient approaches for improving the energy storage performance of these materials, supported by numerous experimental findings. Lastly, the article offers insights into the progress and large-scale fabrication of MIHC electrodes for Li+, Na+, K+, and Zn2+, focusing existing challenges and suggesting future research targets.

TI Crystal regulation towards rechargeable magnesium battery cathode
   materials
SO MATERIALS HORIZONS
AB Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) as a promising energy storage system in terms of high abundance, greater electron transfer number and more uniform deposition behavior of the Mg metal anode have great potential for innovating the future energy storage markets. However, the large intercalation energy penalty and sluggish diffusion kinetics of bivalent Mg(2+)in host materials due to the strong ionic polarization lead to unsatisfactory energy and power densities. Thus, constructing insertion sites and fast diffusion pathways for Mg(2+)in cathode materials is significant for the development of RMBs. Herein, we systematically reviewed the recent developments of various crystal regulation strategies, including topochemical substitution, interlayer regulation, vacancy introduction, substitution doping, and amorphization, for improving the specific capacity, rate capability, redox potential and cycling stability of RMB cathode materials. The optimized mechanisms and regulation rules of various strategies for Mg(2+)intercalation and diffusion were discussed in detail. The unique advantages of various strategies and the promising crystal systems were summarized. Moreover, the unexploited material systems, the untapped crystal regulation strategies, the current challenges and future objectives for high-energy and high-power RMBs are described.

TI Vitamin B12 derived CoCNx composite confined in SBA-15 as
   highly effective catalyst to activate peroxymonosulfate for naproxen
   degradation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Vitamin B-12 confined in the pores of SBA-15 was converted into Co and N co-doped carbon composite (denoted as CoCNx), which was confined in the pores of SBA-15 (CoCNx@SBA-15) after pyrolysis. For comparison, CoCNx catalyst supported on SBA-15 (denoted as CoCNx/SBA-15) was prepared by the impregnation method using VB12 as CoCNx precursor followed by pyrolysis. The catalysts were fully characterized and naproxen (NPX) degradation by catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) on the catalysts was investigated. The characterization results showed that in contrast to CoCNx/SBA-15, CoCNx of CoCNx@SBA-15 was successfully confined in the pores of SBA-15. For catalytic PMS activation for NPX degradation, CoCNx@SBA-15 exhibited a much higher catalytic activity than CoCNx/SBA-15 and CoCNx as well as commonly used carbon-based and Cobased catalysts. Additionally, Co leaching from CoCNx@SBA-15 was substantially suppressed as compared with CoCNx/SBA-15. Accordingly, the removal of either Co or CNx from CoCNx@SBA-15 led to substantially decreased catalytic activity and a considerable synergistic effect was identified between active Co and CNx species for catalytic PMS activation. The reuse of CoCNx@SBA-15 in catalytic PMS activation showed a gradual catalyst deactivation, whereas the activity of the used catalyst could be effectively restored by calcination in N-2 atmosphere.

AB Thermal and magnetic properties of pristine and Stone-Wales (SW) defected zigzag mixed spin-(2, 5/2)AFe(II)Fe(III) (C2O4)(3) nanoribbons have been investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. The variation in thermal and magnetic properties has been examined in terms of the number and the positions of SW-defects relative to the edges and the widths of ribbons, as well as to the temperature. Many interesting phenomena have been obtained, such as first and second order phase transitions, N-type compensation behavior and compensation temperature originating mainly from the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between magnetic ions Fe-III and Fe-II. Furthermore, different hysteresis loop behaviors, such as a single and quintuple hysteresis loops which exhibit different number of steps and various shapes have been observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The contamination of water with antibiotics presents a critical challenge due to its adverse effects on the environment and public health. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), particularly sulfate radical-based AOPs (SR-AOPs), have emerged as promising technologies for antibiotic degradation due to their remarkable oxidative strength and selectivity. Sulfate radicals can produced through the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of highly porous materials, demonstrate exceptional potential in activating PMS for the production of either radical or non-radical reactive species, further enhancing pollutant degradation efficiency. A literature review is carried out on the activation of peroxymonosulfate by MOF materials for antibiotics degradation. By delving into the mechanisms of PMS activation by pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and their derivatives (including both radical and non-radical pathways), this review comprehensively evaluates various MOF/PMS systems to determine their effectiveness in antibiotic degradation. Furthermore, it examines the impact of environmental factors such as pH, temperature, and initial solution concentration on the degradation process. Finally, an overview of the degradation efficiency and mechanisms of MOFs/PMS systems towards antibiotics was provided and the challenges for such applications are proposed. The findings of this review article are expected to contribute significantly to the development of innovative approaches to address the problem of antibiotic degradation in water.

TI A critical review of cathodes for rechargeable Mg batteries
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Benefiting from a higher volumetric capacity (3833 mA h cm(-3) for Mg vs. 2046 mA h cm(-3) for Li) and dendrite-free Mg metal anode, reversible Mg batteries (RMBs) are a promising chemistry for applications beyond Li ion batteries. However, RMBs are still severely restricted by the absence of high performance cathodes for any practical application. In this review, we provide a critical and rigorous review of Mg battery cathode materials, mainly reported since 2013, focusing on the impact of structure and composition on magnesiation kinetics. We discuss cathode materials, including intercalation compounds, conversion materials (O-2, S, organic compounds), water co-intercalation cathodes (V2O5, MnO(2)etc.), as well as hybrid systems using Mg metal anode. Among them, intercalation cathodes are further categorized by 3D (Chevrel phase, spinel structure etc.), 2D (layered structure), and 1D materials (polyanion: phosphate and silicate), according to the diffusion pathway of Mg2+ in the framework. Instead of discussing every published work in detail, this review selects the most representative works and highlights the merits and challenges of each class of cathodes. Advances in theoretical analysis are also reviewed and compared with experimental results. This critical review will provide comprehensive knowledge of Mg cathodes and guidelines for exploring new cathodes for rechargeable magnesium batteries.

TI Metal-Organic Frameworks and Metal-Organic Gels for Oxygen
   Electrocatalysis: Structural and Compositional Considerations
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Increasing demand for sustainable and clean energy is calling for the next-generation energy conversion and storage technologies such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, CO2/N-2 reduction electrolyzers, metal-air batteries, etc. All these electrochemical processes involve oxygen electrocatalysis. Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active-site density through rational design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal-organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach toward improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. MOFs/MOGs afford a broad selection of combinations between metal nodes and organic linkers and are known to produce electrocatalysts with high surface areas, variable porosity, and excellent activity after pyrolysis. Some recent studies on MOFs/MOGs for oxygen electrocatalysis and their new perspectives in synthesis, characterization, and performance are discussed. New insights on the structural and compositional design in MOF/MOG-derived oxygen electrocatalysts are summarized. Critical challenges and future research directions are also outlined.

TI Opportunities in Na/K [hexacyanoferrate] frameworks for sustainable
   non-aqueous Na<SUP>+</SUP>/K<SUP>+</SUP> batteries
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB In the past decade, the most sought-after cathode materials for SIBs and PIBs have included transition metal oxides (TMOs), polyanionic phosphates and fluorophosphates, NASICON-type polyanionic compounds, and alkali metal hexacyanoferrates (AMHCFs/PBAs). From the commercialization perspective, Novasis Energies, Inc. and Faradion Ltd. have successfully used AMHCFs and TMOs as cathode materials, respectively, for large-scale energy storage in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The open framework voids (similar to 3.4 angstrom) in AMHCFs are ideal for the insertion of the larger K+/Na+ ions into PIBs and SIBs. The lower cost/performance ratio due to cheaper raw materials and sustainability due to coulombically efficient cycling stability make AMHCFs ideal cathode materials for sustainable future batteries. In terms of commercial prospects, we review the AMHCFs as cathode materials for both SIBs and PIBs with the focus on optimizing AMHCF cathodes through morphology control, reducing [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies, and minimizing interstitial water, while maintaining high crystallinity and Na+/K+ content in the AMHCFs to enhance the electrochemical performance. Surface engineering, gradient compounds, graphene-based composites, and multiple cation substitutions can create efficient Na+/K+ ion diffusion pathways. The storage mechanisms and optimizing the electrolyte systems in AMHCFs are critical for efficient Na+/K+ ion batteries for stationary storage.

TI Electrochemically active sites inside crystalline porous materials for
   energy storage and conversion
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB The design and development of crystalline porous materials (CPMs), including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), have been subjects of extensive study due to their regular crystalline lattices and well-defined pore structures. In recent times, an enormous amount of research effort has gone into using CPMs as sacrificial templates to fabricate electrochemically functional materials. The inherently electrochemically active sites inside CPMs are notably abundant and being explored with respect to electrochemical reactions. In this review, electrochemically active sites and the space around them (metal ions, ligands, crystal structures, pores, and morphologies) inside CPMs are the focus and recent progress in the fields of metal-ion batteries, metal-air batteries, water splitting, and other related electrochemical devices has been summarized. Overall, this review provides guidance on the preparation of electroactive CPMs via rational design and modulation of active sites such as redox-active metal clusters and organic ligands, and the space around the electrochemically active sites, and their applications in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.

TI Heteroatom-Doping of Non-Noble Metal-Based Catalysts for
   Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution: An Electronic Structure Tuning
   Strategy
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production is an appealing way to reduce carbon emissions and generate renewable fuels. This promising process, however, is limited by its sluggish reaction kinetics and high-cost catalysts. Construction of low-cost and high-performance non-noble metal-based catalysts have been one of the most effective approaches to address these grand challenges. Notably, the electronic structure tuning strategy, which could subtly tailor the electronic states, band structures, and adsorption ability of the catalysts, has become a pivotal way to further enhance the electrochemical water splitting reactions based on non-noble metal-based catalysts. Particularly, heteroatom-doping plays an effective role in regulating the electronic structure and optimizing the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. Nevertheless, the reaction kinetics, and in particular, the functional mechanisms of the hetero-dopants in catalysts yet remains ambiguous. Herein, the recent progress is comprehensively reviewed in heteroatom doped non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, particularly focus on the electronic tuning effect of hetero-dopants in the catalysts and the corresponding synthetic pathway, catalytic performance, and activity origin. This review also attempts to establish an intrinsic correlation between the localized electronic structures and the catalytic properties, so as to provide a good reference for developing advanced low-cost catalysts.

AB Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) materials can be directly carbonized or combined with other materials to obtain porous carbons or composites loaded with metal/metal oxide and doped with nonmetals such as N, P, and B. The addition of dielectric metal oxide, magnetic metal particle, and nonmetallic element can enrich the loss mechanisms and bring abundant heterogeneous interfaces in the composite system, which can enhance the interfacial polarization and relaxation at the interface and increase the scattering of electromagnetic waves.

Herein, the mechanism and classification of microwave absorption materials are briefly discussed and the advantages of MOFs and carbon-based materials in microwave absorption field are considered. The recent achievements of MOFs derived carbon-based microwave absorption composites are summarized in detail, and the effects of different components and special microstructures are also analyzed. In addition, the current challenges and the research perspectives are also proposed.

   Batteries: Development, Challenges, and Prospects
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB The progress on electrode materials over the last few years has greatly facilitated sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) toward practical applications. Cost-effectiveness is the key character to realize practical applications of SIBs. The iron-based phosphate materials (IPBMs) are composed of the resource abundant and low-cost Na-Fe-P-O system and have demonstrated intriguing sodium-storage properties to reach this goal. Starting from NaFePO4, through compositional and structural engineering, many IPBMs have been developed in recent years. This review offers a comprehensive overview about the development of IPBMs. Crystal structure, electrochemical performance, and reaction mechanism of three main categories (phosphates, pyrophosphates, mixed polyanions) of IPBMs and their represented materials are systematically introduced. Besides, the key challenges encountered by IPBMs, including the impurity phase issue, low-quality carbon coating, limited energy density, and random morphology are proposed. Finally, perspectives on the future development of IPBMs from intrinsic properties regulation to full battery manufacturing are highlighted in aspects of electrochemical performance enhancements, mechanism investigation, surface and electrolytes, and commercialization. It is believed that this review is timely and is of great importance to promote applications of cost-effective sodium-ion batteries.

   semiconductor-based sensors for BTEX detection: A review
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB The precise monitoring of extremely deadly volatile organic compounds based on aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) is desired for indoor air quality. Due to their unique morphology, tunable architectures, mesoporous structure, and compositions, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted substantial interest in the fabrication of ultra-sensitive and selective-based gas sensors. This is because of their exceptional characteristics, like specific adsorption affinities, vastly diversified structures, bulky surface area, and functionalized sites. Thus, the current review reports on the recent developments in the design, synthesis, and properties of MOF-derived semiconductor metal oxides (SMOs). Moreover, the fabrication of MOFderived SMO-based sensors for monitoring toxic vapours, such as BTEX compounds, for environmental and air quality applications is also discussed. The gas sensing mechanisms associated with BTEX detection are also highlighted in detail. It further deliberates on the advances in MOF-derived SMO-based sensors for their integration in smartphones, the Internet of Things (IoT), and self-powered sensors to pave the way for cost-efficient and portable monitoring of BTEX. This review concludes by summarizing accomplishments and current challenges, delivering a forthcoming viewpoint for the advancement of next-generation MOF-based sensors in realworld environments.

SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB In battery systems, aqueous electrolytes are superior in ionic conductivity, interfacial wettability, safety and environmentally benign compared to organic liquids, polymers, inorganic solid-state and ionic liquid electrolytes. However, their narrow electrochemical stability window, electrode dissolution/side reactions and temperature-variation instability result in a low energy density, undesirable cyclic lifespan and limited working temperature window in aqueous rechargeable batteries. Herein, the historical development of aqueous electrolytes in various types of batteries, ranging from monovalent-ion batteries, multivalent-ion batteries, metal-air batteries, metal-chalcogen batteries, and hybrid batteries to redox flow batteries is summarized through the representative pioneering works. Meanwhile, the strategies of electrolyte additive, pH-management, salt-concentrated electrolyte, gelling, solvent hybridizing, interface tuning and beyond concentrated electrolyte to mitigate the challenges associated with aqueous electrolytes are reviewed and discussed in detail. All these new electrolyte concepts mutually stabilize aqueous rechargeable batteries and improve their corresponding energy density in a broad temperature range, ushering in a promising aqueous energy storage era.

Exploring not only more efficient renewable energy systems, but also advanced energy conversion and storage materials is an essential requisite to achieve the task. Since the emergence of alkali-ion rechargeable batteries, the development of cathode materials has been considered as a key factor that improves the overall performance of batteries. In this respect, understanding the underlying science of the factors affecting the properties and performance of cathode materials and how to ameliorate them have made remarkable progress. There have been several reports about factors ranging from the nano-to the micrometer scale, and now it is time to build an infrastructure to design advanced cathode materials with a selective and comprehensive perspective on those factors. In this Review article, we discuss the key factors contributing to the properties and performance of cathode materials with a comprehensive perspective on various alkali-ion transition metal compounds. It covers a wide scope of factors from atomic to microscopic levels as follows: atomic, electronic, crystal and particle structures.

TI Beyond Li-ion: electrode materials for sodium- and magnesium-ion
   batteries
SO SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS
AB The need for economical and sustainable energy storage drives battery research today. While Li-ion batteries are the most mature technology, scalable electrochemical energy storage applications benefit from reductions in cost and improved safety. Sodium-and magnesium-ion batteries are two technologies that may prove to be viable alternatives. Both metals are cheaper and more abundant than Li, and have better safety characteristics, while divalent magnesium has the added bonus of passing twice as much charge per atom. On the other hand, both are still emerging fields of research with challenges to overcome. For example, electrodes incorporating Na+ are often pulverized under the repeated strain of shuttling the relatively large ion, while insertion and transport of Mg2+ is often kinetically slow, which stems from larger electrostatic forces. This review provides an overview of cathode and anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, and a comprehensive summary of research on cathodes for magnesium-ion batteries. In addition, several common experimental discrepancies in the literature are addressed, noting the additional constraints placed on magnesium electrochemistry. Lastly, promising strategies for future study are highlighted.

TI Strategies to enhance catalytic performance of metal-organic frameworks
   in sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes for organic
   pollutants removal
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Organic pollutant contamination is a general issue. Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) is an efficient technology for degradation of organic pollutants in aquatic environment. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely applied to activation of persulfate (PDS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) due to their tunable metal clusters/organic ligands, large surface area, well-ordered porous structure, and multiple active sites. Herein this review systematically and comprehensively summarizes basic strategies to enhance catalytic performance of MOFs in SR-AOPs. Two main factors to modulate MOFs are metal clusters and organic ligands. Three strategies of optimization, modification, and composite are introduced. The preparation methods, characterizations, catalytic performances, and mechanisms of several typical MOFs are highlighted. In addition, the prospects and challenges of MOFs applied to SR-AOPs are declared.

TI Negative thermal expansion in framework structure materials
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Negative thermal expansion (NTE) is a counterintuitive physical phenomenon that the unit cell volume of material usually contracts instead of expands upon heating. With two decades' development, NTE has been discovered in many kinds of compounds, in which framework structure materials account for the major part. The flexible bridging linkage units and relatively large void in the crystal structure of framework structure materials facilitate the transverse vibration of atoms, resulting the intriguing NTE. A growing number of framework structure NTE materials have been discovered from the earliest studied oxides, cyanides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and then to fluorides. In this paper, framework NTE materials are reviewed thoroughly in terms of chemical formulas and crystal structures, which involve oxides, fluorides, cyanides, and MOFs. The thermal expansion property of framework structure materials is closely associated with the structure character that a larger framework with more flexible bridge groups encourages a stronger NTE. Since the metal atom size impacts the volume of framework structure, the magnitude of NTE is also sensitive to the metal atom size in a specific crystal structure classification. Accordingly, control methods of thermal expansion aiming at framework structures are summarized, including chemical substitution, local structure distortion, and guest molecular or ions intercalation. As for the control of thermal expansion, chemical substitution is the most widespread method. The recently proposed method of guest molecular or ions intercalation is most effective for the thermal expansion control in large framework structures such as cyanides and MOFs. The local structure distortion shows a significant effect in fluorides, which can be extended to other systems. At last, problems and future developments of framework structure NTE materials are discussed from the aspects of discovery and design of new NTE materials, NTE mechanism, thermal expansion control, and application of NTE materials. Some strategies and ideas are proposed for the development of framework structure NTE materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Metal-Ion Coupled Electron Transfer Kinetics in Intercalation-Based
   Transition Metal Oxides
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Electrochemical metal-ion intercalation systems are acknowledged to be a critical energy storage technology. The kinetics of the intercalation processes in transition-metal based oxides determine the practical characteristics of metal-ion batteries, such as the energy density, power, and cyclability. With the emergence of post lithium-ion batteries, such as sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries, which function predominately in nonaqueous electrolytes of special formulation and exhibit quite varied material stability with regard to their surface chemistries and reactivity with electrolytes, the practical routes for the optimization of metal-ion battery performance become essential. Electrochemical methods offer a variety of means to quantitatively study the diffusional, charge transfer, and phase transformation rates in complex systems, which are, however, rather rarely fully adopted by the metal-ion battery community, which slows down the progress in rationalizing the rate-controlling factors in complex intercalation systems. Herein, several practical approaches for diagnosing the origin of the rate limitations in intercalation materials based on phenomenological models are summarized, focusing on the specifics of charge transfer, diffusion, and nucleation phenomena in redox-active solid electrodes. It is demonstrated that information regarding rate-determining factors can be deduced from relatively simple analysis of experimental methods including cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and impedance spectroscopy.

TI Unfolding the structural features of NASICON materials for sodium-ion
   full cells
SO CARBON ENERGY
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are potential candidates for the replacement of lithium-ion batteries to meet the increasing demands of electrical storage systems due to the low cost and high abundance of sodium. Sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) structured materials have attracted enormous interest in recent years as electrode materials for safer and long-term performance of SIBs for electric energy storage smart grids. These materials have a three-dimensional robust framework, high redox potential, thermal stability, and a fast Na+-ion diffusion mechanism. However, NASICON has low intrinsic electronic conductivity, which limits the electrochemical performance. This review describes the structural features of NASICONs to illustrate the ion storage mechanism and electrochemical performance of SIBs. Details of the NASICON crystal structure, the affiliated Na+-ion diffusion mechanism, morphology, and electrochemical performance of these materials in sodium-ion half-cells as well as full cells are described. In addition to the application as electrode materials, the use of NASICONs as solid electrolytes is also elaborated in solid-state SIBs. Based on these aspects, we have provided more perspectives in terms of the commercialization of SIBs and strategies to overcome the limitations of NASICONs. Hence, this review is expected to provide the researchers of energy storage with an in-depth understanding of NASICON materials with the knowledge of structural features, which will provide a new avenue on the practicality of SIBs.

TI Novel hetero-bimetallic coordination polymer as a single source of
   highly dispersed Cu/Ni nanoparticles for efficient photocatalytic water
   splitting
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB A new strategy for depositing highly dispersed Cu and Ni nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 from a single source is demonstrated for photocatalytic hydrogen production. We used a newly synthesized cyanide-bridged hetero-bimetallic coordination polymer [{Cu-II(4,4-dipy)(2)}{Ni(CN)(4)}](n)0.7(C2H6O2).1.6(H2O) (CP-1) (4,4-dipy = 1,3-di(4-pyridyl)propane) as a single-source precursor of Cu-Ni nanoparticles. The structure of CP-1 was established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis; CP-1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c with = 111.67(3)degrees. CP-1/TiO2 composites containing different weight percentages of CP-1 were achieved by hydrolyzing titanium isopropoxide in the presence of CP-1. Highly dispersed Cu and Ni nanoparticles were deposited on TiO2 by the calcination of the CP-1/TiO2 composites at different temperatures (420 degrees C, 470 degrees C and 520 degrees C) in air followed by reduction in H-2/Ar atmosphere at 470 degrees C for 2 h. XRD, DRS/UV-Vis, TEM, Cu/Ni 2p XPS, and photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of CuO/Cu-0 and NiO/Ni-0 as active co-catalysts on the surface of TiO2. The 1 wt% Cu-Ni/TiO2-470 photocatalyst showed the maximum H-2 production activity of 8.5 mmol h(-1) g(-1) in a glycerol/water mixture (20 vol%). The results are anticipated to direct the future development of efficient, low-cost and noble metal-free semiconductor photocatalysts for solar H-2 production.

It is expected that Na-ion technology will attain a position comparable to Li-ion batteries dependent on advancements in establishing a stable electrode-electrolyte interphase. However, Li and Na are both alkali metals with similar characteristics, yet the physicochemical properties of these systems differ. For this reason, a detailed study on the electrode-electrolyte interphase properties, composition, and structure is required to understand the factors that influence the battery's behavior. Herein, the research that has been performed on the electrode-electrolyte interphase for both anode and cathode in the most important families of electrode materials, including carbonate ester-based and advanced electrolytes such as ether-based carbonates and ionic liquids is presented.

TI Correlating structure-activity-stability relationship of high-valent
   3d-metal-based MOFs and MOF-derived materials for electrochemical energy
   conversion and storage
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB The energy crises and environmental pollution are the current main challenges for society. In this regard, efficient electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies could be a promising solution to overcome these challenges. In the past few years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derived materials have emerged as potential candidates for energy conversion and storage owing to their finely tuned structural and electronic properties, 3D morphology, large surface area, abundant active sites, good stability, and improved mass transport and diffusion. Among the thousands of MOFs reported in the literature, most are prepared using divalent 3d-metals (i.e., Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) with a combination of various organic linkers. In contrast, MOFs based on high-valent 3d metals, such as Ti, V, Cr, and Mn are less studied but have shown promise in energy conversion and storage. The high-valent 3d-metal-based MOFs offer easier synthesis, facile charge, and mass transport, tunable electronic properties, and high synergistic effects. Although many reviews have been published in recent years, none have focused on high-valent 3d-metal-based MOFs and their usage in energy conversion and storage. The current review summarizes the applications of MOFs made from high-valent 3d metals (Ti, V, Cr, and Mn) and their derived materials. This review focuses on the structure, porosity, and stability of high-valent 3d-metal-based MOFs and MOF-derived materials with their application in energy conversion and storage. Taking into account pioneering reports, this review offers a deeper comprehension and insight into the characteristics and uses of high-valent 3d-metal-based MOFs and MOF-derived materials. The recent progress, challenges related to the field, and the structure-activity-stability correlation have been established with plausible prospects.

TI Tug-of-War in the Selection of Materials for Battery Technologies
SO BATTERIES-BASEL
AB Batteries are the heart and the bottleneck of portable electronic systems. They power electronics and determine the system run time, with the size and volume determining factors in their design and implementation. Understanding the material properties of the battery components-anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator-and their interaction is necessary to establish selection criteria based on their correlations with the battery metrics: capacity, current density, and cycle life. This review studies material used in the four battery components from the perspective and the impact of seven ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+), employed in commercial and research batteries. In addition, critical factors of sustainability of the supply chains-geographical raw materials origins vs. battery manufacturing companies and material properties (Young's modulus vs. electric conductivity)-are mapped. These are key aspects toward identifying the supply chain vulnerabilities and gaps for batteries. In addition, two battery applications, smartphones and electric vehicles, in light of challenges in the current research, commercial fronts, and technical prospects, are discussed. Bringing the next generation of batteries necessitates a transition from advances in material to addressing the technical challenges, which the review has powered.

TI Optimal preparation of catalytic Metal-organic framework derivatives and
   their efficient application in advanced oxidation processes
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely concerned for their excellent user-configuration flexibility to be capable of different tasks. A popular trend of their diversified development is pyrolyzing them to produce derived materials with improved stability, conductivity, and well-inherited characteristics. Thanks to these properties, prepared MOF derivatives are gradually testified as alternative catalysts in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), involving Fenton reaction, sulfate radical-based AOPs (SR-AOPs) as well as photocatalysis for efficient pollutants degradation. Unfortunately, the introduction of the synthetic method of MOF derivatives is relatively rough yet and a comprehensive understanding of the differences in their application to different AOPs systems has not emerged.

TI Anticatalytic Strategies to Suppress Water Electrolysis in Aqueous
   Batteries
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB Aqueous electrolytes are the leading candidate to meet the surging demand for safe and low-cost storage batteries. Aqueous electrolytes facilitate more sustainable battery technologies due to the attributes of being nonflammable, environmentally benign, and cost effective. Yet, water's narrow electrochemical stability window remains the primary bottleneck for the development of high-energy aqueous batteries with long cycle life and infallible safety. Water's electrolysis leads to either hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which causes a series of dire consequences, including poor Coulombic efficiency, short device longevity, and safety issues. These are often showstoppers of a new aqueous battery technology besides the low energy density. Prolific progress has been made in the understanding of HER and OER from both catalysis and battery fields. Unfortunately, a systematic review on these advances from a battery chemistry standpoint is lacking. This review provides in-depth discussions on the mechanisms of water electrolysis on electrodes, where we summarize the critical influencing factors applicable for a broad spectrum of aqueous battery systems. Recent progress and existing challenges on suppressing water electrolysis are discussed, and our perspectives on the future development of this field are provided.

TI High-Abundance and Low-Cost Metal-Based Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion
   Batteries: Problems, Progress, and Key Technologies
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Recently, room-temperature stationary sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received extensive investigations for large-scale energy storage systems (EESs) and smart grids due to the huge natural abundance and low cost of sodium. The SIBs share a similar rocking-chair sodium storage mechanism with lithium-ion batteries; thus, selecting appropriate electrodes with a low cost, satisfactory electrochemical performance, and high reliability is the key point for the development for SIBs. On the other hand, the carefully chosen elements in the electrodes also largely determine the cost of SIBs. Therefore, earth-abundant-metal-based compounds are ideal candidates for reducing the cost of electrodes. Among all the high-abundance and low-cost metal elements, cathodes containing iron and/or manganese are the most representative ones that have attracted numerous studies up till now. Herein, recent advances on both iron- and manganese-based cathodes of various types, such as polyanionic, layered oxide, MXene, and spinel, are highlighted. The structure-function property for the iron- and manganese-based compounds is summarized and analyzed in detail. With the participation of iron and manganese in sodium-based cathode materials, real applications of room-temperature SIBs in large-scale EESs will be greatly promoted and accelerated in the near future.

TI Voltage issue of aqueous rechargeable metal-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Over the past two decades, a series of aqueous rechargeable metal-ion batteries (ARMBs) have been developed, aiming at improving safety, environmental friendliness and cost-efficiency in fields of consumer electronics, electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. However, the notable gap between ARMBs and their organic counterparts in energy density directly hinders their practical applications, making it difficult to replace current widely-used organic lithium-ion batteries. Basically, this huge gap in energy density originates from cell voltage, as the narrow electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes substantially confines the choice of electrode materials. This review highlights various ARMBs with focuses on their voltage characteristics and strategies that can effectively raise battery voltage. It begins with the discussion on the fundamental factor that limits the voltage of ARMBs, i.e., electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes, which decides the maximum-allowed potential difference between cathode and anode. The following section introduces various ARMB systems and compares their voltage characteristics in midpoint voltage and plateau voltage, in relation to respective electrode materials. Subsequently, various strategies paving the way to high-voltage ARMBs are summarized, with corresponding advancements highlighted. The final section presents potential directions for further improvements and future perspectives of this thriving field.

TI Spin compensation temperatures in the Monte Carlo study of a mixed
   spin-2 and spin-5/2 Ising ferrimagnetic system
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB The thermomagnetic properties of a Ising ferrimagnetic system on a bipartite square lattice of spins S-i(A) = 2 and sigma(B)(j) = 5/2 with different single-ion anisotropies are analyzed by Monte Carlo simulations. We obtained the phase diagrams at finite temperature of the total magnetization (M-T), the magnetization of sublattices (M-A, M-B), specific heat (C) and the total susceptibility (chi(T)) per spin of the model. In the planes (D-1/vertical bar J(1)vertical bar/k(B)T/vertical bar J(1)vertical bar) and (D-2/vertical bar J(1)vertical bar/k(B)T/vertical bar J(1)vertical bar) the critical and compensation temperatures have been deduced. We found that single-ion anisotropy interactions play an important role for the existence of compensation temperatures. Compensation points may be present, for a specific range of crystal field of sublattice spins sigma(B)(j) = 5/2, even when the anisotropy field of sublattice spins S-i(A) = 2 is zero. Mean field theory predicts a wide range of parameters where the system presents even several compensation temperatures, in most of these regions we found none. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI Composition Optimization and Microstructure Design in MOFs-Derived
   Magnetic Carbon-Based Microwave Absorbers: A Review
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB Magnetic carbon-based composites are the most attractive candidates for electromagnetic (EM) absorption because they can terminate the propagation of surplus EM waves in space by interacting with both electric and magnetic branches. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated their great potential as sacrificing precursors of magnetic metals/carbon composites, because they provide a good platform to achieve high dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles in carbon matrix. Nevertheless, the chemical composition and microstructure of these composites are always highly dependent on their precursors and cannot promise an optimal EM state favorable for EM absorption, which more or less discount the superiority of MOFs-derived strategy. It is hence of great importance to develop some accompanied methods that can regulate EM properties of MOFs-derived magnetic carbon-based composites effectively. This review comprehensively introduces recent advancements on EM absorption enhancement in MOFs-derived magnetic carbon-based composites and some available strategies therein. In addition, some challenges and prospects are also proposed to indicate the pending issues on performance breakthrough and mechanism exploration in the related field.

AB Metal-organic frameworks or MOFs are porous compounds with special properties like controllability in terms of composition and structure coupled with high porosity. These kind of porous materials have enticed a great deal of attention in various fields including energy storage and conversion, ion exchange, separation, sensor, drug delivery, molecular recognition, and catalysis. Also, MOFs have been considered as flexible precursors for synthesis of different nano-materials and novel multifunctional nanocomposites/hybrids with preferable functional characteristics compared to their initial components. Hence, development of different strategies for size and shape controlling of MOFs is very important for obtaining ordered MOFs and their derived materials/hybrids. This review offers an overview of various template strategies for synthesis of MOFs and investigation the morphology effect in MOFs application as well as applying them as precursors and templates for directed synthesis of diverse nano-materials.

TI Advanced cobalt-free cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Attempts to utilize lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in large-scale electrochemical energy storage systems have achieved initial success, and solid-state LIBs using metallic lithium as the anode have also been well developed. However, the sharply increased demands/costs and the limited reserves of the two most important metal elements (Li & Co) for LIBs have raised concerns about future development. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) equipped with advanced cobalt-free cathodes show great potential in solving both "lithium panic" and "cobalt panic", and have made remarkable progress in recent years. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent advances of high-performance cobalt-free cathode materials for advanced SIBs, systematically analyze the conflicts of structural/electrochemical stability with intrinsic insufficiencies of cobalt-free cathode materials, and extensively discuss the strategies of constructing stable cobalt-free cathode materials by making full use of non-cobalt transition-metal elements and suitable crystal structures, all of which aim to provide insights into the key factors (e.g., phase transformation, particle cracks, crystal defects, lattice distortion, lattice oxygen oxidation, morphology, transition-metal migration/dissolution, and the synergistic effects of composite structures) that can determine the stability of cobalt-free cathode materials, provide guidelines for future research, and stimulate more interest on constructing high-performance cobalt-free cathode materials.

TI Faradaic reactions in capacitive deionization for desalination and ion
   separation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a novel technology for desalinating feed water because of its low cost and easy regeneration and in spite of its low desalination capacity and charge efficiency. One of the most promising methods to address these issues is replacing traditional carbon materials with materials that can store ions via faradaic reactions (here known as faradaic electrode materials). Faradaic electrode materials have three main advantages over carbon materials: high capacity, low energy loss, and selective separation; thus, faradaic materials have attracted the interest of many scholars. However, there has not been a comprehensive review of the advances in faradaic materials in desalination and ion separation. In this paper, we present an overview of three kinds of architectures of faradaic deionization cells and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. A variety of faradaic materials are introduced in terms of their structures, merits, drawbacks, and methods to address their deficiencies are discussed. The performance of faradaic electrode materials in desalination, the removal of heavy metals and ion separation is also presented. The issues related to performance are identified, and ways to address them are proposed.

TI Challenges and Strategies toward Cathode Materials for Rechargeable
   Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB With increasing demand for grid-scale energy storage, potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have emerged as promising complements or alternatives to commercial lithium-ion batteries owing to the low cost, natural abundance of potassium resources, the low standard reduction potential of potassium, and fascinating K+ transport kinetics in the electrolyte. However, the low energy density and unstable cycle life of cathode materials hamper their practical application. Therefore, cathode materials with high capacities, high redox potentials, and good structural stability are required with the advancement toward next-generation PIBs. To this end, understanding the structure-dependent intercalation electrochemistry and recognizing the existing issues relating to cathode materials are indispensable prerequisites. This review summarizes the recent advances of PIB cathode materials, including metal hexacyanometalates, layered metal oxides, polyanionic frameworks, and organic compounds, with an emphasis on the structural advantages of the K+ intercalation reaction. Moreover, major current challenges with corresponding strategies for each category of cathode materials are highlighted. Finally, future research directions and perspectives are presented to accelerate the development of PIBs and facilitate commercial applications. It is believed that this review will provide practical guidance for researchers engaged in developing next-generation advanced PIB cathode materials.

AB The increasing demands for renewable energy to substitute traditional fossil fuels and related large-scale energy storage systems (EES) drive developments in battery technology and applications today. The lithium-ion battery (LIB), the trendsetter of rechargeable batteries, has dominated the market for portable electronics and electric vehicles and is seeking a participant opportunity in the grid-scale battery market. However, there has been a growing concern regarding the cost and resource availability of lithium. The sodium-ion battery (SIB) is regarded as an ideal battery choice for grid-scale EES owing to its similar electrochemistry to the LIB and the crust abundance of Na resources. Because of the participation in frequency regulation, high pulse-power capability is essential for the implanted SIBs in EES. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the exploration of high-power cathode and anode materials for SIB is presented, and deep understanding of the inherent host structure, sodium storage mechanism, Na+ diffusion kinetics, together with promising strategies to promote the rate performance is provided. This work may shed light on the classification and screening of alternative high rate electrode materials and provide guidance for the design and application of high power SIBs in the future.

TI Activation of persulfates by carbonaceous materials: A review
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In recent years, persulfate-based advanced oxidation processes (PS-AOPs) for removal of organic contaminants from water have gained wide attention. Ever-emerging carbonaceous materials, including pristine carbon materials and their derivatives, heteroatom-doped carbon materials, and carbon materials with metal particles, are demonstrated to be effective in the activation of persulfates (peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS)) to generate free radicals or non-radical active species for degradation of the contaminants. In this paper, mechanisms for the activation of persulfates by carbonaceous materials and their composites are analyzed and summarized. In particular, the synergistic effect for activation improvement in the composites or in the hybrid activation systems is explored. Then the influence of the environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature, inorganic anions and dissolved organic matter, on the activation processes are discussed. Deactivation and regeneration of the carbonaceous materials are discussed as well. Finally, the application of these carbonaceous materials in activating persulfates for remediation of contaminated groundwater and treatment of wastewater are reviewed and the challenges for such applications are proposed.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a new kind of porous crystalline materials have attracted much interest in many applications due to their high porosity, diverse structures, and controllable chemical structures. However, the specific geometrical morphologies, limited functions and unsatisfactory performances of pure MOFs hinder their further applications. In recent years, an efficient approach to synthesize new composites to overcome the above issues has been achieved, by integrating MOF coatings with other functional materials, which have synergistic advantages in many potential applications, including batteries, supercapacitors, catalysis, gas storage and separation, sensors, drug delivery/cytoprotection and so on. Nevertheless, the systemic synthesis strategies and the relationships between their structures and application performances have not been reviewed comprehensively yet. This review emphasizes the recent advances in versatile synthesis strategies and broad applications of MOF coatings. A comprehensive discussion of the fundamental chemistry, classifications and functions of MOF coatings is provided first.

TI Unique role of Mossbauer spectroscopy in assessing structural features
   of heterogeneous catalysts
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Their wide availability in nature, low cost, high reactivity, and low toxicity make Fe-based catalysts versatile in various catalysis fields, including photocatalysis, Fenton-like reaction, electrocatalysis, Li-ion batteries (LIBs), Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), biomass conversion, N2O decomposition and etc. Mossbauer spectroscopy, a powerful technique that is able to give account of structural features for all iron species taking part in the catalysis process, is considered to be a crucial technique for determining catalyst phase, identifying active site, and investigating correlations between catalytic behavior and the coordination structure of catalysts, which are highly desirable for clarifying the catalytic mechanisms. Each kind of Fe-based materials could be functionalized in the most suitable catalysis field, wherever Mossbauer technique may play a unique role. For instance, Fe-N-C based materials are extensively investigated as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and Mossbauer spectroscopy application in this field has been utilized to identify the chemical nature of the active site on the Fe-N-C catalyst. Iron carbides are considered as the most active phase for FTS and Mossbauer technique is widely applied in determining the chemical phase of catalysts. Fe-based silicates, phosphates or polyanionic compounds are recognized as promising cathode materials for Ins, for which Mossbauer technique has been mainly applied for tracking of the oxidation state and coordination environment change of Fe between charged and discharged states of the batteries. Similar phenomena can also be found in other catalysis fields. To give a clear understanding of which field is most suitable for a certain Fe-based catalyst and the best role of the Mossbauer technique in a certain catalysis field associated with the investigation of the mechanism, in this review, the recent advances of applying Mossbauer technique in catalysis are thoroughly summarized, including results from environmental catalysis and energy catalysis. Remarkable cases of study are highlighted and brief insight into applying Mossbauer technique for various Fe-based materials in their special catalysis field is presented. Finally, the trends for future potential applications of Mossbauer technique are discussed.

   for sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation process: A review
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based materials as the emerging catalysts for sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) applications have progressively become a burgeoning research field. Herein, an in-depth overview of state-of-the-art MOFs-based materials currently available in SR-AOPs applications for environmental remediation is presented. The synthetic strategies of different types of MOFs-based materials are summarized. Most importantly, particular emphasis is placed on the applications of MOFs-based materials in SR-AOPs for wastewater treatment. Identification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the radical and non-radical pathways is addressed. Moreover, the theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to predict and explore the possible reaction mechanisms in MOFs-based SR-AOPs are summarized and discussed. Special attention has been focused on the effects of structure on the catalytic activities and the circumstance of radical and non-radical reaction mechanisms in MOFs-based SR-AOPs. Finally, the unresolved challenges of the existent MOFs-based SR-AOPs are pointed out and the outlooks of future research directions are proposed.

TI Metal-Organic Frameworks for Batteries
SO JOULE
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives are two developing families of functional materials for energy storage and conversion. Their high porosity, versatile functionalities, diverse structures, and controllable chemical compositions offer immense possibilities in the search for adequate electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. Despite these advantageous features, MOFs and their derivatives as electrode materials face various challenging issues, which impede their practical applications. From this perspective, we present both the opportunities and challenges that MOFs/MOF composites and MOF-derived materials bring to rechargeable batteries, including lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-oxygen batteries, and sodium-ion batteries. By discussing the development of MOFs/MOF composites and MOF-derived materials in each battery system, some design principles that dominate the specific electrochemical behaviors are outlined, with the key requirements that a practical electrode should fulfill At the end, a basic guidance and future directions for further development are provided.

TI Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites as electrodes for
   lithium battery applications: Novel means for alternative energy storage
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a novel class of advanced functional materials due to their many well-known merits (e.g., ultrahigh porosity, favorable pore size distribution, easy functionalization, and structural tailorability). However, their use in various electronics applications is restricted due to their insulating nature. Therefore, a need arises to intercalate MOFs with various functional/conductive materials for synergistic applications like electrode materials (e.g., diverse Li-ion batteries: LIBs). In this review, the recent developments on pristine MOFs and their derived nanostructures (e.g., nanoporous carbons and metal oxides) for electrode applications are discussed in detail. We focused on the recent applications of various MOF-based composites in anodic/cathodic materials (e.g., LIBs, lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S), lithium-air batteries (Li-O-2), and lithium hybrid electrochemical capacitors (Li-HEC)) along with details associated with their electrochemical performance. This review is expected to help materials scientists to construct a roadmap for the selection of the best possible electrode materials for LIBs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Recent advance of Fe-based bimetallic persulfate activation catalysts
   for antibiotics removal: Performance, mechanism, contribution of the key
   ROSs and degradation pathways
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Antibiotic residues have been widely discovered in different types of water bodies, posing a critical risk to the water ecosystem and human health. Persulfate activation based advanced oxidation process (AOP), as an actual hot research topic for the removal of antibiotic contaminants from water has shown advantages of strong oxidation, high selectivity and wide pH applicability range. Iron -based heterogeneous activators have become the most popular transition metal materials in this persulfate-based AOP due to their versatility, flexibility, efficiency and environmental friendliness. Low-cost, highly stable and catalytically excellent iron -based bimetallic catalysts could activate persulfate exceptionally, which sorted out the vulnerability of single Fe activators to deactivation, low efficiency and susceptibility to secondary contamination. This article reviewed the characteristics and research progress of spinel ferrites, Fe -containing layered double hydroxides, Fe -based bimetallic metal-organic frameworks, Fe -based perovskites, Fe -containing bimetallic oxide complexes and other Fe -based bimetallic catalysts, evaluated their strengths and weaknesses and summarized the commonly used modification methods. Besides a systematic discussion on the intrinsic mechanisms driving the process of persulfate activation with iron -based bimetallic catalysts, it is for the first time that the workflows of qualitative analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and two calculation models for quantitative determination of their contribution rates have been thoroughly organized. The commonly degradation pathways and toxicity analysis of six types of antibiotics were summarized. Finally, research progress in engineering design of materials is also generalized. It is expected to provide clear ideas for future research about the development and application of Fe -based bimetallic catalysts, the corresponding modifications, derivatives and complexes in the activated persulfate process and to improve the reasoning of the degradation mechanism of this system.

TI Research on engineered electrocatalysts for efficient water splitting: a
   comprehensive review
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Water electrolysis plays an interesting role toward hydrogen generation for overcoming global environmental crisis and solving the energy storage problem. However, there is still a deficiency of efficient electrocatalysts to overcome sluggish kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Great efforts have been employed to produce potential catalysts with low overpotential, rapid kinetics, and excellent stability for HER and OER. At present, hydrogen economy is driven by electrocatalysts with excellent characteristics; thus, systematic design strategy has become the driving force to exploit earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalysts toward H-2 economy. In this review, the recent progress on newer materials including metals, alloys, and transition metal oxides (manganese oxides, cobalt oxides, nickel oxides, PBA-derived metal oxides, and metal complexes) as photocatalysts/electrocatalysts has been overviewed together with some methodologies for efficient water splitting. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based electrocatalysts have been highly exploited owing to their interesting functionalities. The photovoltaic-electrocatalytic (PV-EC) process focused on harvesting high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) among various solar energy conversion as well as storage systems. Electrocatalysts/photocatalysts with high efficiency have become an urgent need for overall water splitting. Also, cutting-edge achievements in the fabrication of electrocatalysts along with theoretical consideration have been discussed.

SO ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA
AB Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted increasing attention for energy storage systems because of abundant and low cost sodium resources. However, the large ionic radius of sodium and its slow electrochemical kinetics are the main obstacles for the development of suitable electrodes for high-performance SIBs. The development of high-performance cathode materials is the key to improving the energy density of SIBs and facilitating their commercialization. Herein, we review the latest advances and progress of cathode materials for SIBs, including transition metal oxides, polyanions, ferrocyanides, organic materials and polymers, and amorphous materials. Additionally, we have summarized our previous works in this area, explore the relationship between structure and electrochemical performance, and discuss effective ways to improve the reversibility, working potential and structural stability of these cathode materials.

TI Challenges of today for Na-based batteries of the future: From materials
   to cell metrics
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Several emerging battery technologies are currently on endeavour to take a share of the dominant position taken by Li-ion batteries in the field of energy storage. Among them, sodium-based batteries offer a combination of attractive properties i.e., low cost, sustainable precursors and secure raw material supplies. Na-based batteries include related battery concepts, such as Na-ion, all solid-state Na batteries, Na/O-2 and Na/S, that differ in key components and in redox chemistry, and therefore result in separate challenges and metrics. Na-ion batteries represent an attractive solution which is almost ready to challenge Li-ion technology in certain applications; the other cell concepts represent a more disruptive innovation, with a higher performance gain, provided that major hurdles are overcome. The present review aims at highlighting the most promising materials in the field of Na-based batteries and challenges needed to be addressed to make this technology industrially appealing, by providing an in-depth analysis of performance metrics from recent literature. To this end, half-cell reported metrics have been extrapolated to full cell level for the more mature Na-ion technology to provide a fair comparison with existing technologies.

TI Topological Motifs in Cyanometallates: From Building Units to
   Three-Periodic Frameworks
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB This review focuses on topological features of three-periodic (framework) p, d, and f metal cyano complexes or cyanometallates, i.e. coordination compounds, where CN- ligands play the main structure-forming role. In addition, molecular, one-periodic (chain), and two-periodic (layer) cyanometallates are considered as possible building blocks of the three-periodic cyanometallates. All cyanometallates are treated as systems of nodes (mononuclear, polynuclear, or transitional metal cluster complexes) joined together via CN-containing spacers. The most typical nodes and spacers as well as methods of their connection are described and systematized. Particular attention is paid to the overall structural motifs in the three-periodic cyanometallates, especially to the relations between the local coordination (coordination figure) of structural units and the entire framework topology. The chemical factors are discussed that influence the cyanometallate topological properties due to modification of nodes, spacers, or coordination figures.

Many technical bottlenecks (such as lower ionic-electronic conductivity, huge volume effect and easy pulverization resulted from long-term charge/discharge process) prevent the development and large scale application of traditional anode materials. As a novel kind of advanced multi-functional materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivative materials behave enough pore structures promoting rapid migration of Li+ and electron, and high specific surface areas providing abundant active sites for electrochemical reaction. Importantly, tunable structure and chemical composition of the MOFs and their derivative materials can be further optimized by changing parameters synthesis process, thereby markedly increases specific capacity and cycle stability of lithium ion batteries. Herein, the recent progress in the MOFs and their derivative materials used as anode for lithium ion batteries are reviewed systematically, and the relationships between their preparation methods, microstructures, morphologies and corresponding electrochemical properties are summarized detailly. The urgent problems and challenges of this class of anode materials for lithium ion batteries are also analyzed. On the basis of resonable choosing organic ligands and metal centers, some effective measures for improving performances of lithium storage are proposed by combining with the variability and particularity of structure of the MOFs and their derivative materials, and the feasible strategies for commercialization application are suggested. Finally, the perspective and future development in design and fabrication of the new types of nano porous anodes with high energy efficiencies relation with the next generation lithium ion battery are further discussed.

TI The role of graphene aerogels in rechargeable batteries
SO ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Energy storage systems, particularly rechargeable batteries, play a crucial role in establishing a sustainable energy infrastructure. Today, researchers focus on improving battery energy density, cycling stability, and rate performance. This involves enhancing existing materials or creating new ones with advanced properties for cathodes and anodes to achieve peak battery performance. Graphene aerogels (GAs) possess extraordinary attributes, including a hierarchical porous and lightweight structure, high electrical conductivity, and robust mechanical stability. These qualities facilitate the uniform distribution of active sites within electrodes, mitigate volume changes during repeated cycling, and enhance overall conductivity. When integrated into batteries, GAs expedite electron/ion transport, offer exceptional structural stability, and deliver outstanding cycling performance. This review offers a comprehensive survey of the advancements in the preparation, functionalization, and modification of GAs in the context of battery research. It explores their application as electrodes and hosts for the dispersion of active material nanoparticles, resulting in the creation of hybrid electrodes for a wide range of rechargeable batteries including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), Li-metal-air batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) and zinc-air batteries (ZABs), aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) and aluminum-air batteries and other.

TI Transition metal nitroprussides: Crystal and electronic structure, and
   related properties
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB This review summarizes the state of the art on the structural features, thermal and environmental stability, physical properties and potential applications of transition metal nitroprussides, for their 3D, 2D, 1D and 0D structures. The nitroprusside ion, [Fe(CN)(5)NO](2 -), forms insoluble solids with monovalent and divalent transition metals. The crystal structure for the coordination polymers obtained with divalent metals shows a marked dependence on the used preparative route, metal nature and hydration degree, which was the origin of many incongruities in studies published a few decades ago. Nowadays, the structural features and related properties for the immense majority of the solids formed with such metal ions are known and discussed in this review. The preparation of transition metal nitroprussides using co-ligands with different coordination capability to modulate the dimensionality and related properties of the resulting solids has been on the spotlight of research during the last few years, particularly those related to atypical magnetic behavior. This subject is also herein summarized, revealing the large diversity of hybrid inorganic-organic frameworks that can be obtained with some of their physical properties only recently revealed, among them, the thermal-induced spin transition in ferrous nitroprussides containing monodentate and bridging organic ligands acting as pillar or pseudo-pillars in 2D and 3D hybrid materials. This contribution also includes a general overview of the use of spectroscopic tools such as XPS, XAS, Mossbauer, UV-vis-NIR, IR and Raman, to access electronic and structural characteristics of this family of materials. We also carried out a critical analysis of those research areas that, in our opinion, require further studies, representing opportunities to make important scientific contributions on new knowledge on this family of materials. This is the first general review on transition metal nitroprussides. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Applications of chiroptical spectroscopy to coordination compounds
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Chiroptical methods represent indispensable tools for structural studies of chiral coordination compounds. Numerous applications in asymmetric catalysis, chiral recognition, chiral materials, and supramolecules stabilized by metals have fuelled their ongoing development. Materials derived from chiral coordination compounds have attracted considerable interest due to the possibility to fine-tune their physical properties through versatile chemical synthesis. This review provides an overview of the applicability range of chiroptical methods as a principle tool for chirality investigation, and typical applications of chiral coordination chemistry. The potential of electronic and vibrational chiroptical methods in the design and characterization of coordination compounds is discussed. The electronic optical activity in the form of circular dichroism (CD) continues to be the most frequent tool in stereo-chemical analysis. The potential of vibrational optical activity (VOA) for chiral coordination compounds is still poorly explored, especially when compared with VOA's role in organic chemistry and biochemistry. However, the vibrational region can often provide unique and more detailed information than the electronic methods, because of higher spectroscopic resolution, reduced dependence on characteristic chromophores, and better reproducibility of the spectra by theoretical methods.

TI Towards multifunctional magnetic systems through molecular-programmed
   self assembly of Re(IV) metalloligands
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB The molecular-programmed approach based on the use as ligands of tailor-made metalloligands containing stable six-coordinate rhenium(IV) as paramagnetic centres is presented in this review article. A relatively large amount of spin density is covalent-delocalized away from the rhenium to the peripheral atoms of the ligands in the case of the Re(IV) metalloligands, as shown by polarized neutron diffraction experiments and density functional theory calculations. This feature accounts for the significant through space-magnetic interactions that occur in most of its mononuclear species and more interestingly it also explains the strengthening of the magnetic interactions in the heterometallic Re(IV)-X-3d units respect to the 3d'-X-3d ones, X being a mono- or polyatomic bridging ligand. The complexing ability of the mononuclear Re(IV) species having halo- and pseudohalogeno, cyanide and dicarboxylate groups as peripheral ligands towards either fully solvated metal ion or partially blocked metal complexes allowed the rational preparation of heterometallic compounds with controlled dimensionality and interesting magnetic properties. The variety and a priori easy functionalization of the peripheral donors of these stable Re(IV) precursors, together with their potential bridging ability make them very promising candidates to create multifunctional molecule-based magnetic materials in a very near future.

TI Growth Mechanism of Micro/Nano Metal Dendrites and Cumulative Strategies
   for Countering Its Impacts in Metal Ion Batteries: A Review
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Metal-ion batteries are capable of delivering high energy density with a longer lifespan. However, they are subject to several issues limiting their utilization. One critical impediment is the budding and extension of solid protuberances on the anodic surface, which hinders the cell functionalities. These protuberances expand continuously during the cyclic processes, extending through the separator sheath and leading to electrical shorting. The progression of a protrusion relies on a number of in situ and ex situ factors that can be evaluated theoretically through modeling or via laboratory experimentation. However, it is essential to identify the dynamics and mechanism of protrusion outgrowth. This review article explores recent advances in alleviating metal dendrites in battery systems, specifically alkali metals. In detail, we address the challenges associated with battery breakdown, including the underlying mechanism of dendrite generation and swelling. We discuss the feasible solutions to mitigate the dendrites, as well as their pros and cons, highlighting future research directions. It is of great importance to analyze dendrite suppression within a pragmatic framework with synergy in order to discover a unique solution to ensure the viability of present (Li) and future-generation batteries (Na and K) for commercial use.

TI Recent advances and prospects of layered transition metal oxide cathodes
   for sodium-ion batteries
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Due to the high safety, long service life and outstanding energy density, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in portable energy storage devices. However, the uneven distribution and increasingly high price of lithium resources have hindered the further use of LIBs, particularly for large-scale energy storage. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) that have the same working principle as LIBs have, emerged as some of the most promising candidate devices for use in large-scale energy storage applications and low-speed electric automobiles, due to the low cost and abundant reserves of sodium resources. As a key component of SIBs, the cathode materials have a remarkable effect on the electrochemical performance. Layered transition metal oxides have been considered to be some of the most promising cathodes for SIBs due to their flexibility, versatility, and excellent electrochemical performances. Although layered materials face several challenges such as irreversible phase transition, inferior capacity retention and poor air stability, recent experimental studies have proposed corresponding strategies to solve these problems. Herein, we will survey the latest progress in the development of high-energy SIBs cathodes focusing on high-voltage, high-capacity and composite-structure cathode materials.

TI Nano Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Inorganic Hybrid Nanomaterials:
   Synthetic Strategies and Applications
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Nano- (or micro-scale) metal-organic frameworks (NMOFs), also known as coordination polymer particles (CPPs), have received much attention because of their structural diversities and tunable properties. Besides the direct use, NMOFs can be alternatively used as sacrificial templates/precursors for the preparation of a wide range of hybrid inorganic nanomaterials in straightforward and controllable manners. Distinct advantages of using NMOF templates are correlated to their structural and functional tailor-ability at molecular levels that is rarely acquired in any other conventional template/precursor. In addition, NMOF-derived inorganic nanomaterials with distinct chemical and physical properties are inferred to dramatically expand the scope of their utilization in many fields. In this review, we aim to provide readers with a comprehensive summary of recent progress in terms of synthetic approaches for the production of diverse inorganic hybrid nanostructures from as-synthesized NMOFs and their promising applications.

TI Sodium-based batteries: from critical materials to battery systems
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Sodium-based energy storage systems are attracting tremendous attention along with the growing demand for electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Sharing similar intercalation chemistry to their lithium counterpart, sodium-ion based systems show promising potential for large-scale application due to the benefit of the low cost and natural abundance of sodium sources. However, despite the rapid progress, sodium-based energy storage systems still face enormous challenges such as slow kinetics and unstable cyclability, which continue to attract intense research efforts. In this review, we briefly summarize the recent progress in the material design for sodium-ion batteries, including both inorganic and organic materials. Then, we systematically summarize the current strategies for building post-sodium batteries, typically Na-O-2, Na-S, Na-Se, and Na-CO2, with a focus on the key components of different devices, including the electrode materials, electrolytes, and cell structure. Particularly, we discuss in detail the reaction path between Na and S (Se) to facilitate the understanding of the electrochemical mechanism of sodium-ion based systems. Furthermore, to highlight the recent progress, we discuss the design and optimization of Na-O-2 (CO2) batteries through an evaluation of the electrolytes and cathode configuration with suitable gas channels, which are critical factors to determine the reaction mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of sodium-based energy systems are also presented.

TI Orbital Magnetic Moment and Single-Ion Magnetic Anisotropy of the S=1/2
   K3[Fe(CN)6] Compound: A Case Where the Orbital
   Magnetic Moment Dominates the Spin Magnetic Moment
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), K-3[Fe-III(CN)(6)], is known for its exceptional magnetic anisotropy among the 3d transition metal series. The Fe(III) ions are in the S = 1/2 low spin state imposed by the strong crystal field of the cyanido ligands. A large orbital magnetic moment is expected from previous publications. In the present work, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism was recorded for a powder sample, allowing direct measurement of the Fe(III) orbital magnetic moment. A combination of molecular multiconfigurational ab initio and atomic ligand field multiplets calculations provides the spin and orbital magnetic moments for the [Fe-III(CN)(6)](3-) isolated cluster, the crystallographic unit cell, and the powder sample. The calculations of the angular dependencies of the spin and orbital magnetic moments with the external magnetic induction direction reveal easy magnetization axes for each S = 1/2 molecular entity and the crystal. It also shows that the orbital magnetic moment dominates the spin magnetic moment for all directions. Our measurements confirm that the orbital magnetic moment contributes to 60% of the total magnetization for the powder, which is in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. An orbital magnetic moment greater than the spin magnetic moment is exceptional for 3d transition metal ions. The impact of crystal field strength and distortion, pi back-bonding, spin-orbit coupling, and external magnetic induction was analyzed, leading to a deeper understanding of the spin and orbital magnetic anisotropies.

TI Optical Phenomena in Molecule-Based Magnetic Materials
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB Since the last century, we have witnessed the development of molecular magnetism which deals with magnetic materials based on molecular species, i.e., organic radicals and metal complexes. Among them, the broadest attention was devoted to molecule-based ferro-/ferrimagnets, spin transition materials, including those exploring electron transfer, molecular nanomagnets, such as single-molecule magnets (SMMs), molecular qubits, and stimuli-responsive magnetic materials. Their physical properties open the application horizons in sensors, data storage, spintronics, and quantum computation. It was found that various optical phenomena, such as thermochromism, photoswitching of magnetic and optical characteristics, luminescence, nonlinear optical and chiroptical effects, as well as optical responsivity to external stimuli, can be implemented into molecule-based magnetic materials. Moreover, the fruitful interactions of these optical effects with magnetism in molecule-based materials can provide new physical cross-effects and multifunctionality, enriching the applications in optical, electronic, and magnetic devices. This Review aims to show the scope of optical phenomena generated in molecule-based magnetic materials, including the recent advances in such areas as high-temperature photomagnetism, optical thermometry utilizing SMMs, optical addressability of molecular qubits, magneto-chiral dichroism, and opto-magneto-electric multifunctionality. These findings are discussed in the context of the types of optical phenomena accessible for various classes of molecule-based magnetic materials.

TI Promises and Challenges of Next-Generation "Beyond Li-ion" Batteries for
   Electric Vehicles and Grid Decarbonization
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB The tremendous improvement in performance and cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have made them the technology of choice for electrical energy storage. While established battery chemistries and cell architectures for Li-ion batteries achieve good power and energy density, LIBs are unlikely to meet all the performance, cost, and scaling targets required for energy storage, in particular, in large-scale applications such as electrified transportation and grids. The demand to further reduce cost and/or increase energy density, as well as the growing concern related to natural resource needs for Li-ion have accelerated the investigation of so-called "beyond Li-ion" technologies. In this review, we will discuss the recent achievements, challenges, and opportunities of four important "beyond Li-ion" technologies: Na-ion batteries, K-ion batteries, all-solid-state batteries, and multivalent batteries. The fundamental science behind the challenges, and potential solutions toward the goals of a low-cost and/or high-energy-density future, are discussed in detail for each technology. While it is unlikely that any given new technology will fully replace Li-ion in the near future, "beyond Li-ion" technologies should be thought of as opportunities for energy storage to grow into mid/large-scale applications.

TI MOFs and COFs for Batteries and Supercapacitors
SO ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as two burgeoning families of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been extensively investigated and applied in various fields on account of their enticing features as large surface area, controllable crystalline structure and highly ordered pores/channels. However, the greatest stumbling block to their widespread application in electrochemical energy storage systems is the inferior electrical conductivity. Therefore, numerous efforts have been exerted on exploiting the advantages and remedying the disadvantages. In this review, we mainly focus on pristine MOFs and COFs, emphasize the recent progress and highlight the milestones of their applications in the fields of lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-air batteries and supercapacitors. We hope to provide a constructive view of the structure-activity relationship between CPMs and energy storage systems and promote their future development.Graphic Abstract

TI Paramagnetic NMR in solution and the solid state
SO PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY
AB The field of paramagnetic NMR has expanded considerably in recent years. This review addresses both the theoretical description of paramagnetic NMR, and the way in which it is currently practised. We provide a review of the theory of the NMR parameters of systems in both solution and the solid state. Here we unify the different languages used by the NMR, EPR, quantum chemistry/DFT, and magnetism communities to provide a comprehensive and coherent theoretical description. We cover the theory of the paramagnetic shift and shift anisotropy in solution both in the traditional formalism in terms of the magnetic susceptibility tensor, and using a more modern formalism employing the relevant EPR parameters, such as are used in first-principles calculations. In addition we examine the theory first in the simple non-relativistic picture, and then in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. These ideas are then extended to a description of the paramagnetic shift in periodic solids, where it is necessary to include the bulk magnetic properties, such as magnetic ordering at low temperatures. The description of the paramagnetic shift is completed by describing the current understanding of such shifts due to lanthanide and actinide ions. We then examine the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, using a simple model employing a phenomenological picture of the electronic relaxation, and again using a more complex state-of-the-art theory which incorporates electronic relaxation explicitly. An additional important consideration in the solid state is the impact of bulk magnetic susceptibility effects on the form of the spectrum, where we include some ideas from the field of classical electrodynamics. We then continue by describing in detail the solution and solid-state NMR methods that have been deployed in the study of paramagnetic systems in chemistry, biology, and the materials sciences. Finally we describe a number of case studies in paramagnetic NMR that have been specifically chosen to highlight how the theory in part one, and the methods in part two, can be used in practice. The systems chosen include small organometallic complexes in solution, solid battery electrode materials, metalloproteins in both solution and the solid state, systems containing lanthanide ions, and multi-component materials used in pharmaceutical controlled-release formulations that have been doped with paramagnetic species to measure the component domain sizes.

TI Bimetallic metal-organic frameworks and their derivatives
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have two different metal ions in the inorganic nodes. According to the metal distribution, the architecture of bimetallic MOFs can be classified into two main categories namely solid solution and core-shell structures. Various strategies have been developed to prepare bimetallic MOFs with controlled compositions and structures. Bimetallic MOFs show a synergistic effect and enhanced properties compared to their monometallic counterparts and have found many applications in the fields of gas adsorption, catalysis, energy storage and conversion, and luminescence sensing. Moreover, bimetallic MOFs can serve as excellent precursors/templates for the synthesis of functional nanomaterials with controlled sizes, compositions, and structures. Bimetallic MOF derivatives show exposed active sites, good stability and conductivity, enabling them to extend their applications to the catalysis of more challenging reactions and electrochemical energy storage and conversion. This review provides an overview of the significant advances in the development of bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives with special emphases on their preparation and applications.

TI Odyssey of Multivalent Cathode Materials: Open Questions and Future
   Challenges
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB The rapidly expanding field of nonaqueous multivalent intercalation batteries offers a promising way to overcome safety, cost, and energy density limitations of state-of-the-art Li-ion battery technology. We present a critical and rigorous analysis of the increasing volume of multivalent battery research, focusing on a wide range of intercalation cathode materials and the mechanisms of multivalent ion insertion and migration within those frameworks. The present analysis covers a wide variety of material chemistries, including chalcogenides, oxides, and polyanions, highlighting merits and challenges of each class of materials as multivalent cathodes. The review underscores the overlap of experiments and theory, ranging from charting the design metrics useful for developing the next generation of MV-cathodes to targeted in-depth studies rationalizing complex experimental results. On the basis of our critical review of the literature, we provide suggestions for future multivalent cathode studies, including a strong emphasis on the unambiguous characterization of the intercalation mechanisms.

TI Mixed valency in ligand-bridged diruthenium frameworks: divergences and
   perspectives
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The present review article illustrates the mixed valence aspects of ligand-bridged symmetric and unsymmetric diruthenium complexes beyond the textbook example of the Creutz-Taube ion as well as the Robin and Day classification by citing representative examples based on our recent observations. The consideration of varied coordination situations involving bridging and ancillary ligands of diverse electronic and steric demands extended important fundamental events including (i) the influence of ancillary ligands besides the bridge in the intermetallic coupling process, (ii) varying profile of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transition in (RuRuII)-Ru-III (d(5)d(6)) and (RuRuIV)-Ru-III (d(5)d(4)) mixed valence set up, (iii) divergence between the electrochemical (K-c = comproportionation constant) and electronic (IVCT) coupling and (iv) occurrence of the hybrid class II-class III situation. Furthermore, additional challenges due to the introduction of redox non-innocent ligands in assigning valence and spin distributions at the metal-ligand interface as well as in differentiating the emerging alternatives of the radical-derived state and the mixed valence situation along the redox chain have been addressed.

TI Designing Advanced Vanadium-Based Materials to Achieve Electrochemically
   Active Multielectron Reactions in Sodium/Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are considered to be promising alternatives to replace current lithium-ion batteries due to the high abundance of sodium and potassium resources. New energetic vanadium-based compounds that undergoes multielectron reactions and demonstrate good sodium/potassium storage capability, provide new solutions for high-performance SIBs/PIBs in terms of high energy/power density and long-time cyclability. So far, desirable rich redox centers (V2+-V5+), consolidated frameworks, and the high theoretical capacities of vanadium-based compounds have been widely explored for practical applications. Rational materials design utilizing vanadium multiredox centers and the fundamental understanding of their charge-transfer processes and mechanisms are critical in the development of high-performance battery systems. The scientific importance and basic design strategies for high performance V-based anode/cathode materials, structure-function properties and state-of-the-art understanding of V-based electrode materials are herein classified and highlighted alongside their design strategies. The important role of the valence electron layer of vanadium, and the scientific advances of vanadium partitions in other electrochemical behaviors are also summarized in detail. Finally, relevant strategies and perspectives discussed in this review provide practical guidance to explore the undiscovered potentials of multi-electron reaction relationships of not only V-based composites, but also other types of electrode materials.

TI Controlling dynamic magnetic properties of coordination clusters
   via switchable electronic configuration
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Large-sized coordination clusters have emerged as a new class of molecular materials in which many metal atoms and organic ligands are integrated to synergize their properties. As dynamic magnetic materials, such a combination of multiple components functioning as responsive units has many advantages over monometallic systems due to the synergy between constituent components. Understanding the nature of dynamic magnetism at an atomic level is crucial for realizing the desired properties, designing responsive molecular nanomagnets, and ultimately unlocking the full potential of these nanomagnets for practical applications. Therefore, this review article highlights the recent development of large-sized coordination clusters with dynamic magnetic properties. These dynamic properties can be associated with spin transition, electron transfer, and valence fluctuation through their switchable electronic configurations. Subsequently, the article also highlights specialized characterization techniques with different timescales for supporting switching mechanisms, chemistry, and properties. Afterward, we present an overview of coordination clusters (such as cyanide-bridged and non-cyanide assemblies) with dynamic magnetic properties, namely, spin transition and electron transfer in magnetically bistable systems and mixed-valence complexes. In particular, the response mechanisms of coordination clusters are highlighted using representative examples with similar transition principles to gain insights into spin state and mixed-valence chemistry. In conclusion, we present possible solutions to challenges related to dynamic magnetic clusters and potential opportunities for a wide range of intelligent next-generation devices.
