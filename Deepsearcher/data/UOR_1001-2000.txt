TI Ni5P4-embedded FeV LDH porous nanosheets for
   enhancing oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB At present, it is still challenging to design high-performance and low-cost non-noble mental catalysts. In this work, nickel phosphide (Ni5P4) was combined with FeV LDH via an in situ growth approach to form porous nanosheet arrays. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of atoms between Ni5P4 and FeV LDH, the hybrid electrocatalyst displays significantly enhanced electro-catalytic properties for the anodic reaction. Impressively, the Ni5P4@FeV LDH material delivers 10, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of only 204, 250 and 416 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Additionally, it also exhibits superior properties for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a low cell voltage of 1.44 V at 50 mA cm(-2) and retains stability for at least 15 h in the alkaline electrolyte with 0.33 M urea. This strategy provides a new idea for the design and synthesis of transition metal phosphides that can be used as an efficient electrocatalyst for electrolysis of water and wastewater treatment.

TI Accelerating the generation of NiOOH by in-situ surface phosphating
   nickel sulfide for promoting the proton-coupled electron transfer
   kinetics of urea electrolysis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) is a highly promising electrocatalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and NiOOH formed by the surface phase transition of Ni3S2 during UOR is the ideal catalytic active species. However, the strong covalent bonds of Ni3S2 hinders the generation of NiOOH, limiting the further improvement of UOR activity. Herein, the Ni3S2@Ni3P core-shell nanorods have been constructed by an in-situ surface phosphating method to boost UOR performance, realizing high catalytic activity (100/1000 mA cm-2 at 1.36/1.49 V vs. RHE, respectively) and a rapid kinetics (19.13 mV dec-1). The Ni3P on the surface of Ni3S2 can rapidly form highly active gamma-NiOOH with low energy consumption, and the formed Ni3S2@gamma-NiOOH accelerates proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) kinetics through reducing the energy barrier of urea dehydrogenation process, thereby enhancing UOR intrinsic activity. In addition, we also demonstrate a Ni3S2@Ni3P//Ni3S2@Ni3P urea electrolysis device with low voltages of 1.54 and 1.69 V at current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively. This work proposes an efficient strategy to accelerate the generation of NiOOH on the surface of Ni3S2 during UOR electrocatalysis, revealing the enhanced UOR mechanism of Ni3S2@Ni3P, which can promote the development of urea-assisted hydrogen production.

TI NixFe100-x for urea and oxygen evolution: a matter of compromise
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The combination of aqueous electrolysis, either for hydrogen generation or CO2 conversion, with wastewater treatment offers an elegant way to tackle issues associated with our energy transition and the need for clean drinking water. However, it requires an anode capable of doing both the oxidation of the targeted pollutant and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as most pollutants are present in too low concentration to be practical for industrial electrolysis. In this study, we focussed on the oxidation of urea on NixFe100-x catalysts. These catalysts were prepared by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, a versatile and green technique to prepare electrocatalysts. Transmission electron microscopy of the nanoparticles indicates the production of monodisperse nanoparticles, with an average diameter increasing from 7.8 +/- 2.8 to 19.7 +/- 3.9 nm with a higher iron fraction. The composition could be controlled between pure Ni and NiFe bimetallic nanoparticles with up to 56 +/- 3% of iron, by controlling the composition of the target. A brief optimisation of the electrode preparation (loading, catalyst-to-carbon ratio) yielded an optimum at about 30 mu g/cm2 of catalyst with a catalyst-to-carbon ratio of 20:80. During the electrocatalytic tests, Ni was the best catalyst for urea oxidation, with a maximum peak current of 619 mA/mg. However, Ni75Fe25 was the best OER catalyst, showing a peak current of 1150 mA/mg. The difference increased further during CA at 0.5 V, during which Ni75Fe25 outperformed pure Ni by almost a factor of 3 after 30 min.

TI Surface Engineering of a Nickel Oxide-Nickel Hybrid Nanoarray as a
   Versatile Catalyst for Both Superior Water and Urea Oxidation
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Developing efficient and low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes is a pressing but still challenging task for energy conversion technologies such as water electrolysis, regenerative fuel cells, and rechargeable metal-air batteries. Hence, this study reports that a nickel oxide-nickel hybrid nanoarray on nickel foam (NiO-Ni/NF) could act as a versatile anode for superior water and urea oxidation. Impressively, this anode could attain high current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) at extremely low overpotentials of 292 and 323 mV for OER, respectively. Besides, this electrode also shows excellent activity for urea oxidation with the need for just 0.28 and 0.36 V (vs SCE) to attain 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, respectively. The enhanced oxidation performance should be due to the synergistic effect of NiO and Ni, improved conductivity, and enlarged active surface area.

TI Electrodeposited Porous Nickel-Copper as a Non-Noble Metal Catalyst for
   Urea-Assisted Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolysis for Hydrogen
   Production
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with other less energy-intense oxidizing reactions is an attractive option to reduce the energy demand for hydrogen production in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer using transition metals and their alloys. Since urea is commonly available as a waste product, pairing the urea oxidation at the anode with hydrogen evolution at the cathode in alkaline electrolysis can alleviate environmental issues while simultaneously producing hydrogen. In this respect, we prepared nickel-copper films on nickel felt substrate as a urea oxidation catalyst, which exhibited a lower Tafel slope compared to oxygen evolution, indicating a more favorable reaction pathway. Confirming the improvement, in an AEM electrolyzer, a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) required a cell voltage of 1.60 V for urea coupled hydrogen production compared to 1.83 V for water oxidation. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide were identified using mass spectrometry (MS) as the main gaseous products during urea electrolysis. A relatively stable zero-gap AEM urea electrolyzer operation at room temperature for over 120 h and at 323.15 K under intermittent power conditions, using nickel-copper catalyst as anode and nickel-molybdenum catalyst as cathode, was demonstrated. Finally, an efficient hydrogen production in the zero-gap alkaline urea electrolyzer at a lower voltage than for water electrolysis was proven using online MS analysis. These results validate the feasibility of reducing the specific energy consumption of electrolyzers used for low-carbon hydrogen production with renewable energy sources.

TI Hybrid ZnO nanostructures modified graphite electrode as an efficient
   urea sensor for environmental pollution monitoring
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Herein, we propose a facile electrochemical sensing platform for urea detection using pencil graphite electrode modified nanocomposites of CuO/ZnO and Fe2O3/ZnO. The detection of urea is essential to monitor for identifying its pollution in the water, at the soil surface and in diagnosing urea cycle disorder related diseases. Therefore, an effective, accurate, cost-effective method of diagnosis is urgently needed. Nanostructured metal oxides have the potential ability to detect molecules even at trace level and to explore this, the present work is formulated with Cu and Fe based ZnO nanocomposites for enhancing the sensing performance towards electrochemical sensing of urea. The sensing responses were confirmed from the increase in oxidation current with respect to the concentration of urea. The results show that Fe2O3/ZnO coated graphite electrode has a higher response against urea compared to ZnO and CuO/ZnO. The cyclic voltammetry studies also validate urea sensing of Fe-ZnO in the linear range of 0.8 mu g/mL to 4 mu g/mL, with the detection limit of 2.5 mu g/mL. This suggests that the cost-effective pencil graphite electrode modified Fe2O3/ZnO can be utilized as a promising analytical tool for urea sensing.

TI Lanthanum-doped α-Ni(OH)2 1D-2D-3D hierarchical
   nanostructures for robust bifunctional electro-oxidation
SO PARTICUOLOGY
AB The development of advanced electrocatalysts for electro-oxidation reactions has attracted much attention because of the critical role of such electrocatalysts in improving the overall efficiency of coupled hydrogen production. We have developed an efficient lanthanum-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) bifunctional catalyst with a 1D-2D-3D hierarchical nanostructure. It shows superior activity and stability in the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Enrichment of the edge sites and conducting La doping in alpha-Ni(OH)(2) phase enable formation and stabilization of abundant local Ni3+ ions. This guarantees ultralow onset potentials in electro-oxidation reactions. The 1D-2D-3D hierarchical nanostructure significantly boosts the in situ generation of high-valence active species, which results in efficient and stable OER and UOR performances, and the synergistic merit of doping-induced facile reaction kinetics. Because of the structural benefits of a large surface area, charge-transfer promotion, good structural stability, and bifunctionality, a 1% La-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) hierarchical nanostructure gives superior OER and UOR performances with low overpotentials, large catalytic current densities, and excellent operational stability. It is therefore a promising catalyst for use in simultaneous alkaline wastewater treatment and hydrogen production.

TI Insight into the Structure of Mn-NiS2 during Urea Oxidation
   Using Combined In Situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and Attenuated
   Total Reflectance Surface-Enhanced Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB The urea electrocatalytic oxidation reaction (UOR) has enormous potential as an ideal alternative anode reaction for water splitting owing to its lower thermodynamic equilibrium potential of 0.37 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE). Nickel-based materials, especially NiOOH, are considered to be one of the most promising non-noble metal catalysts for UOR due to their inexpensive cost and rich abundance. However, NiOOH displays a high overpotential and poor long-term stability. Herein, our density functional theory calculations show that the rate-determining step for UOR is desorption of CO2 on NiOOH, and Mn-doped NiOOH has the lowest energy for CO2 desorption. Hence, we prepared a Mn-NiS2 precatalyst that would transform into the active form of Mn-NiOOH during the electrochemical process. The catalyst exhibits good performance for UOR, achieving 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.426 V (vs RHE, without IR correction) for 200 h with no significant voltage change, which is rarely reported for nonprecious-metal UOR catalysts. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction characterization show the transformation from sulfide to oxyhydroxide when a voltage is applied, while in situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) proves that Mn-NiOOH accelerates the desorption of CO2 compared to NiOOH.

TI Water-Stable Pillared Three-Dimensional Zn-V Bimetal-Organic Framework
   for Promoted Electrocatalytic Urea Oxidation
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the potential routes in which urea-rich wastewater is used as a source of energy for hydrogen production. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have promising applications in electrocatalytic processes, although there are still challenges in identifying the MOFs' molecular regulation and obtaining practical catalytic systems. The current study sought to synthesize [Zn-6(IDC)(4)(OH)(2)(Hprz)(2)](n) (Zn-MOF) with three symmetrically independent Zn(II) cations connected via linear N-donor piperazine (Hprz), rigid planar imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate (IDC3-), and -OH ligands, revealing the 3,4T1 topology. The optimized noble-metal-free Zn0.33V0.66-MOF/NF electrocatalysts show higher robustness and performance compared to those of the parent Zn monometallic MOF/NF electrode and other bimetallic MOFs with different Zn-V molar ratios. The low potential of 1.42 V (vs RHE) at 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea required by the developed Zn0.33V0.66-MOF electrode makes its application in the UOR more feasible. The availability of more exposed active sites, ion diffusion path, and higher conductivity result from the distinctive configuration of the synthesized electrocatalyst, which is highly stable and capable of synergistic effects, consequently enhancing the desired reaction. The current research contributes to introducing a practical, cost-effective, and sustainable solution to decompose urea-rich wastewater and produce hydrogen.

TI The effect of saturation magnetization of nanocatalyst and oscillating
   magnetic field for green urea synthesis
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Hematite and cupric oxide nanowires have been synthesized using the oxidation method for green urea production. Hematite nanowires were obtained by the oxidation of an iron wire at a temperature of 650 degrees C and ambient pressure in the presence of N-2 and O-2 gases. Cupric oxide nanowires were obtained by the same method at 700 degrees C, using a copper wire. The X-ray diffraction results show the formation of rhombohedral structure of alpha-Fe2O3 and monoclinic phase of CuO. FE-SEM results reveal the formation of nanowires with dimensions ranging between 5-15 mu m and 4-12 mu m in length and a diametere ranging between 50-150 nm and 50-250 nm for alpha-Fe2O3 and CuO respectively. The VSM results show that the saturation magnetization values for hematite and cupric oxide were 132.8700 and 0.0124 emu/g, respectively. The nanowires were used as catalyst for green urea synthesis in the presence of an oscillating and a static magnetic fields. The use of nanocatalyst with high saturation magnetization

TI Synthesis of binary nanohybrid-based polygonal Pd nanoparticles for
   proficient photoelectrochemical oxidation of methanol and urea
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB The use of high-performance electrocatalysts is critical for the electrooxidation of methanol and urea, but there are some potential challenges. A binary nanocomposite was created based on palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs), and the anchored gold solution (HAuCl4 center dot 3H(2)O) was deposited onto PdNPs via a one-step photodeposition technique. Otherwise, the as-prepared graphene was added to PdNPs using the hydrothermal route to exhibit the second nanocomposite Pd/graphene. Pd deformed into a polygonal shape in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent. Throughout the photodeposition of Au on the surface of PdNPs, the surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) was observed near 523 nm, resulting in a significant decrease in the diameter size from 27m to 18.6 nm. The attenuation of photoluminescence intensity also demonstrated that Pd/graphene is more efficient for charge separation, which is favorably reflected in the efficiency of the single fuel cell. After adding Au and graphene to PdNPs, the surface roughness was improved. Besides, electrochemical data showed that Pd/graphene has superior mass-specific behavior equal to 76.96 mC/mg under visible light illumination rather than in the dark state (52 mC/mg) during methanol oxidation. Otherwise, the mass-specific activity of Pd/Au under such urea conditions has a value of 31.86 mC/mg. To avoid the harsh conditions and to depend on the obtained promising data, it can be concluded that such a preparation method is a reliable synthetic route for the production of a nanocomposite system for attaining maximum electrochemical oxidation of both methanol and urea.

TI High efficient trifunctional electrocatalyst based on bimetallic oxide
   with rich oxygen vacancies towards electrochemical oxidation of small
   molecules at high current density
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Exploiting low-cost, high-activity and robust-stability catalysts has become a meaningful and challenging research topic in the development of hydrogen production via electro-chemical water splitting, meanwhile the as-synthesized materials exhibiting multi-functional electrocatalytic performance is highly desirable, but remains tremendous dif-ficulty. Herein, a facile and scalable strategy is developed to synthesize nanowire-like NiCo2O4 arrays with space group Fd3m in-situ grown on cobalt foam (denoted as NiCo2O4/CF) via hydrothermal approach and air calcination treatment. The as-prepared nanoporous NiCo2O4/CF electrode possesses a high specific surface area, multiple redox couples and rich oxygen vacancies, thus displaying excellent tri-profitable catalytic activ-ities towards hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Experimental results show that affording current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 needs potentials of-0.172 and-0.149 V for HzOR, delivering 100 and 500 mA cm-2 current densities merely requires low potentials of 1.343 and 1.440 V for UOR. Impressively, for MOR, a potential of only 1.5 V is required to achieve a high current density of 1058 mA cm-2, outperforming most of the reported electrocatalysts. What's more, the NiCo2O4/CF electrode exhibits exceptional stability at a high current density of 100 mA cm-2 over 20 h for all of the three small molecules electro-oxidation. The current work provides a promising application opportunity for the nanowire-like NiCo2O4 in the aspect of energy-saving hydrogen generation with the assistance of small molecule electro-oxidation reaction.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI Carbon fiber confined mixed Ni-based crystal phases with interfacial
   charge redistribution induced by high bond polarity for electrochemical
   urea-assisted hydrogen generation
SO CARBON ENERGY
AB Interfacial electronic structure modulation of nickel-based electrocatalysts is significant in boosting energy-conversion-relevant urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, porous carbon nanofibers confined mixed Ni-based crystal phases of Ni2P and NiF2 are developed via fluorination and phosphorization of Ni coated carbon nanofiber (Ni2P/NiF2/PCNF), which possess sufficient mesoporous and optimized Gibbs adsorption free energy by mixed phase-induced charge redistribution. This novel system further reduces the reaction energy barrier and improves the reaction activity by addressing the challenges of low intrinsic activity, difficulty in active site formation, and insufficient synergism. A considerably high current density of 254.29 mA cm(-2) is reached at 1.54 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode on a glass carbon electrode, and the cell voltage requires 1.39 V to get 10 mA cm(-2) in hydrogen generation, with very good stability, about 190 mV less than that of the traditional water electrolysis. The facile active phase formation and high charge transfer ability induced by asymmetric charge redistribution are found in the interface, where the urea molecules tend to bond with Ni atoms on the surface of heterojunction, and the rate-determining step is changed from CO2 desorption to the fourth H-atom deprotonation. The work reveals a novel catalyst system by interfacial charge redistribution induced by high bond polarity for energy-relevant catalysis reactions.

TI Achieving low-energy consumption water-to-hydrogen conversion via urea
   electrolysis over a bifunctional electrode of hierarchical cuprous
   sulfide@nickel selenide nanoarrays
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Replacing sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation reaction is a promising strategy for hydrogen-generation from water with low-energy consumption. However, the involved six-electron transfer process makes it formidable and seems critical. Hence, exploring high-efficient and low-cost bifunctional catalysts toward urea electrolysis is highly desirable. Herein, hierarchical cuprous sulfide@nickel selenide nanowire arrays were grown on copper foam (termed as Cu2S@Ni3Se2) via a developed method composed of in situ chemical deposition, ion exchange and electrodeposition. The as-prepared bifunctional Cu2S@Ni3Se2 not only shows remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity but also affords excellent urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity. A subsequently configured Cu2S@Ni3Se2//Cu2S@Ni3Se2 full-cell (Cu2S@Ni3Se2 working as both anode and cathode) only requires a low voltage of 1.48 V to launch a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), not only surpassing the routine water electrolysis (1.70 V), but also outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C//IrO2 for urea electrolysis (1.65 V). Moreover, the performance is superior to most recently reported ones that configured with other catalysts. This work presents a solid step for hydrogen-generation from water with low-energy consumption. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Heteroatom Engineering in Earth-Abundant Cobalt Electrocatalyst for
   Energy-Saving Hydrogen Evolution Coupling with Urea Oxidation
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The development of multifunctional electrocatalysts with high performance for electrocatalyzing urea oxidation-assisted water splitting is of great significance for energy-saving hydrogen production. In this work, we demonstrate a novel heteroatom engineering strategy for development of B-doped Co as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Density functional theory (DFT) results suggest that a B dopant can efficiently adjust the electron reconstruction of the exposure of Co sites nearby and facilitate electron transfer, resulting in an optimal d-band center along with a lower Gibbs free energy barrier. Ultimately, the obtained B-Co exhibits pH-universal HER properties in various electrolytes. A highly efficient HER performance with overpotentials as low as 27, 163, and 430 mV to -10, -100, and -500 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, is observed for the B-Co electrode. More importantly, the UOR-assisted electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 1.55 V to produce the current densities of 50 mA cm-2, resulting in a 200 mV saving-energy potential compared to water electrolysis, demonstrating its high efficiency of hydrogen production in industrial applications.

TI Achieving efficient urea electrolysis by spatial confinement effect and
   heterostructure
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode in water elec-trolysis, which can reduce the thermodynamic potential of electrochemical water splitting. Currently, UOR performance is mainly limited by the 6 e(-); transfer process, requiring high-performance catalysts to reduce overpotential. Here, we innovatively designed and synthesized a binder-free self-standing composite electro-catalyst, viz. a carbon layer containing Fe2P/Co2P nanoparticles on a nickel foam substrate with Mo2S3 ([Fe2P/ Co2P]@Mo2S3/NF). FeCo-prussian blue analogue (PBA)/nickel foam (NF) was obtained from cobalt-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOFs) by anion exchange at room temperature, and then [Fe2P/Co2P] @Mo2S3/NF was derived through high-temperature phosphating and hydrothermal treatment of FeCo-PBA/NF. After high-temperature phosphating treatment, FeCo-PBA collapses to form a carbon layer tightly wrapping on the NF skeleton. The carbon layer has a confinement effect on Fe2P/Co2P nanoparticles, preventing the nano -particles from agglomerating and deactivating. Simultaneously, Fe2P/Co2P/NF and Mo2S3 form a heterostructure to optimize the electronic structure and accelerate electron transfer and urea activation, and make metal phosphides prone to interfacial oxidation during UOR catalysis. The internal carbon layer containing (FeP)-P-2/(CoP)-P-2 nanoparticles acts as a conductive support for better electron transfer from the interior to the exterior metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide species and Mo2S3 species. The synergistic interaction amang Fe2P/Co2P, hydroxide/ oxyhydroxide and Mo2S3 enhances the catalytic performance of [Fe2P/Co2P]@Mo2S3/NF. Strong hydrophilicity and superaerophobicity are conducive to electrolyte immersion and bubble detachment, which further promotes the [Fe2P/Co2P]@Mo2S3/NF catalyst to exhibit excellent UOR catalytic performance, only requiring potential of 1.36 V (vs. RHE) at 100 mA cm(-2) with low Tafel slope of 41.5 (-1) in alkaline solution. Remarkably, the electrochemical activity of [Fe2P/Co2P]@Mo2S3/NF displays only slightly decay after 72 h durability test.

TI Temperature effect on crystallinity and chemical states of nickel
   hydroxide as alternative superior catalyst for urea electrooxidation
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Developing a highly efficient and stable catalyst, composited by inexpensive, earth-abundant and nontoxic materials, is the critical issue for electrochemical urea oxidation. Among the all other physical parameters, the reaction temperature plays the key role in catalyst performance. Herein, we have studied the effect of temperatures on the synthesis of nickel hydroxide-carbon nanotubes composites via a facile hydrothermal method and the catalytic performance towards urea electro-oxidation in detail. Our studies indicate that the higher temperature enhances the crystallinity of beta-Ni(OH)(2) species. Furthermore, the Ni(III) species in Ni(OH)(2)-CNTs composites show an optimal point upon the changes of the reaction temperature, and the highest Ni(III) content appears at 80 degrees C of beta-Ni(OH)(2)-CNTs. Meanwhile, electrochemical studies show that the electrochemically active surface areas (ESA) of the optimized beta-Ni(OH)(2)-CNTs (80 degrees C, 95.6 m(2) g(-1)) catalyst is 4.51- and 2.76-fold higher than that of beta-Ni(OH)(2)-CNTs synthesized at 20 and 140 degrees C, respectively. The higher ESA of beta-Ni(OH)(2)-CNTs (80 degrees C) also accompanies a superior electrochemical urea oxidation with a peak current density of 98.5 mA cm(-2), significantly higher than all the other studied catalysts. Additionally, the optimal beta-Ni(OH)(2)-CNTs (80 degrees C) also demonstrates the highest initial and limiting current densities after uninterrupted long-term operation. These excellent performance of beta-Ni(OH)(2)-CNTs (80 degrees C) catalyst indicates the positive effect of Ni(III) content which provides more catalytically active species along with the unique lamellar structures of CNTs as the support to facilitate electron/mass transfer and gas emission.

TI Synergistic Engineering of Doping and Vacancy in Ni(OH)2 to
   Boost Urea Electrooxidation
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) has been identified as one of the best promising electrocatalyst candidates for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) due to its flexible structures, wide compositions, and abundant 3d electrons under alkaline conditions. However, its layered structure with limited exposed edge sites severely hinders further improvement of the UOR activity. Herein, oxygen-vacancy rich and vanadium doped Ni(OH)(2) (O-vac-V-Ni(OH)(2)) catalysts are prepared and synergistically boost the urea electrooxidation. Vanadium doping contributes more exposed active sites, and simultaneously generates oxygen vacancies, switching the rate-determining step of UOR from *COOH deprotonation to the N-H bond cleavage process and lowering the thermodynamic barrier by around 1.13 eV. The novel O-vac-V-Ni(OH)(2) demonstrates good electrocatalytic performances with a working potential of 1.47 V at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Synergistic engineering of doping and oxygen vacancy is a promising strategy for designing efficient UOR electrocatalysts.

TI Interfacial engineering of a CoSe@NiFe heterostructure electrocatalyst
   for high-efficiency water and urea oxidation
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB Electro-oxidation reactions as critical half-reactions in both overall and assisted water electrolysis play a pivotal role in realizing highly effective and energy-saving hydrogen generation and achieving simultaneous wastewater degradation. Herein, we synthesize a porous and hierarchical CoSe@NiFe/NF heterostructure electrocatalyst constructed by coupling uniform CoSe nanosheets with well-dispersed Ni(OH)2 and Fe2O3 spherical nanoparticles in situ grown on a Ni foam (NF) substrate via a facile and scalable two-step method (i.e., electrodeposition and hydrothermal treatment). Differing from its monophasic counterpart, the CoSe@NiFe/NF electrode possesses impressive multifunctional electrocatalytic activity, exhibiting low potentials of 1.46, 1.36, 1.38 and 1.38 V at 100 mA cm-2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), respectively. Excitingly, the durability is higher than 90 h at high current densities of 400 and 100 mA cm-2 for the OER and UOR, respectively, without obvious attenuation. In situ Raman spectroscopy and ex situ characterization unveiled the surface self-reconstruction of Ni(OH)2 and Fe2O3 to evolve Ni(Fe)-oxyhydroxides as the real active substances for the OER. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the reconstructed heterogeneous interface can regulate the intrinsic electronic structure and optimize the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, thereby accelerating charge transfer and facilitating the reaction kinetics during the OER. Interestingly, the asymmetric electrolyte cell (CoSe@NiFe/NF||Pt/C/NF) needs cell voltages of only 1.44 and 1.40 V to drive a current density of 100 mA cm-2 for overall water and urea splitting with long-term durability for more than 20 h. This study not only provides valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms governing electrocatalysis but also presents a facile and efficient scheme for constructing multifunctional all-in-one electrocatalysts tailored for sustainable green hydrogen production.

TI One-step electrodeposited NiFeMo hybrid film for efficient hydrogen
   production via urea electrolysis and water splitting
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Urea electrolysis as a promising approach to highly effective and energy-saving hydrogen production, is gaining increasing attention to cope with the global energy crisis and environmental issues. In this study, we report a NiFeMo hybrid film acting as cathode and anode materials in an electrolytic cell for urea electrolysis to hydrogen generation and purification of wastewater containing urea. The NiFeMo prepared by simple one-step electrodeposition exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Meanwhile, the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of NiFeMo can ensure the smooth progress of hydrogen production in the wastewater of varying urea concentration. The results show that Mo dopant has significant effects on HER performance of the NiFeMo. The excellent OER and UOR performance of the NiFeMo is derived from synergism of these three metals and the formation of active intermediates. This work provides a facile method to synthesize low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis and water splitting, which may open up new opportunities for hydrogen production.

TI One-step electrodeposition synthesis of amorphous
   NiCoFe(OH)x/NF as an efficient catalyst for urea-assisted
   overall water splitting
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB An environmentally friendly method of producing hydrogen is electrocatalytic water splitting, but the high theoretical potential of the anode's OER (1.23 V vs. RHE) restricts the efficiency of hydrogen production. Therefore, using the urea oxidation reaction (UOR, theoretical potential of 0.37 V vs. RHE) in place of the OER can significantly increase the efficiency of hydrogen production. Here, we grow the hydroxide layer of Ni-Co-Fe directly on NF by one-step electrodeposition and obtain the best catalyst by regulating the elemental ratio of Co and Fe. Through tests, it is found that NiCoFe(OH)x/NF(Co: Fe=3: 1) exhibits the best electrocatalytic performance, and the required potential is only 1.24 and 1.30 V when the current density reaches 10 and 50 mA cm-2 in the UOR process, which is 170 and 140 mV lower than the OER overpotential under the same conditions, showing a more advantageous anodic catalytic effect. At the same time, integral water decomposition in an electrolyte of 1 M KOH adds with 0.5 M urea also shows more favorable catalytic activity and stability. The NiCoFe(OH)x/NF(Co: Fe=3: 1) plays an important role in improving the efficiency of hydrogen production by water splitting through simple electrodeposition, and has sustainable development prospects.

The porous nanostructure of Ni3N and the nickel foam provide abundant active sites andchannel during catalytic process. Moreover, Ru doping and rich defects favor to boost thereaction kinetics by optimizing the adsorption/desorption or dissociation of intermediatesand reactants. The above advantages enable RueNi(3)N@NC to have good bifunctional catalytic performance in alkaline media. Only 43 and 270 mV overpotentials are required forhydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions to drive a current of10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, it also showed good electrocatalytic performance in neutral andalkaline seawater electrolytes for HER with 134 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2 )and 83 mV to drive100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, the as-designed RueNi3N@NC also ownsextraordinary catalytic activity and stability toward UOR. Moreover, using the synthesizedRueNi(3)N@NC nanomaterial as the anode and cathode of urea assisted water decomposition, a small potential of 1.41 V was required to reach 10 mA cm(-2). It can also be powered by sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar and thermal energies. In order to make better use of the earth's abundant resources, this work provides a new way to develop multifunctional green electrocatalysts. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI Heterostructured Ni3S2-Ni3P/NF as a
   Bifunctional Catalyst for Overall Urea-Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen
   Generation
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been proposed to replace the formidable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to reduce the energy consumption for producing hydrogen from electrolysis of water owing to its much lower thermodynamic oxidation potential compared to that of the OER. Therefore, exploring a highly efficient and stable hydrogen evolution and urea electrooxidation bifunctional catalyst is the key to achieve economical and efficient hydrogen production. In this paper, we report a heterostructured sulfide/phosphide catalyst (Ni3S2-Ni3P/NF) synthesized via one-step thermal treatment of Ni(OH)(2)/NF, which allows the simultaneous occurrence of phosphorization and sulfuration. The obtained Ni3S2-Ni3P/NF catalyst shows a sheet structure with an average sheet thickness of similar to 100 nm, and this sheet is composed of interconnected Ni3S2 and Ni3P nanoparticles (similar to 20 nm), between which there are a large number of accessible interfaces of Ni3S2-Ni3P. Thus, the Ni3S2-Ni3P/NF exhibits superior performance for both UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the overall urea-water electrolysis, to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), cell voltage of only 1.43 and 1.65 V is required using this catalyst as both the anode and the cathode. Moreover, this catalyst also maintains fairly excellent stability after a long-term testing, indicating its potential for efficient and energy-saving hydrogen production. The theoretical calculation results show that the Ni atoms at the interface are the most efficient catalytically active site for the HER, and the free energy of hydrogen adsorption is closest to thermal neutrality, which is only 0.16 eV. A self-driven electron transfer at the interface, making the Ni3S2 sides become electron donating while Ni3P sides become electron withdrawing, may be the reason for the enhancement of the UOR activity. Therefore, this work shows an easy treatment for enhancing the catalytic activity of Ni-based materials to achieve high-efficiency urea-water electrolysis.

TI Urea-nitrate combustion synthesis of CuO/CeO2nanocatalysts
   toward low-temperature oxidation of CO: the effect of Red/Ox ratio
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The low-temperature catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) is the key process to overcome incomplete combustion of fossil fuels for both commercial (e.g., lowering automotive emissions) and domestic (e.g., indoor air quality improvement) applications. So the development of cost-effective and high-active catalysts made from non-noble metals is an actual material science challenge. Ce-Cu-O oxide system is one of the most prospective to investigate due to the feasibility of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood dual-site oxidation mechanism, and, in our previous work, it was shown that solution combustion synthesis using the urea as fuel in stoichiometric ratio with metal nitrates is a most reasonable fuel choice toward the synthesis of CuO/CeO(2)nanocatalysts for effective CO oxidation. In this work, the effect of the Red/Ox (urea to nitrates orU/N) ratio on the catalytic oxidation activity of resulting CuO/CeO(2)composites is in the spotlight. Series of CuO/CeO(2)nanocatalysts were successfully synthesized via the urea-nitrate combustion method withU/Nratios from 0.2 to 1.4 and then were applied for CO oxidation. The samples before and after catalysis were characterized by EDX, SEM, PXRD, N-2-ASA, H-2-TPR, etc. It was shown that theU/Nratio strongly affects the qualitative and quantitative X-ray phase composition (c-CeO2,m-CuO, andam-CuO, in general), CeO(2)and CuO crystallite sizes (4.9-63.0 nm and 14.7-28.3 nm, correspondently), specific surface area (4-46 m(2)/g) and porosity (0.009-0.033 cm(3)/g), as well as the morphology of nanocomposites and their catalytic characteristics (t(50%) = 113-199 degrees C andt(100%) = 137-348 degrees C). The sample synthesized atU/N = 0.2 shows the best oxidative performance (t(50%) = 113 degrees C andt(100%) = 137 degrees C) explained by the highest surface (46 m(2)/g), the lowest CeO(2)crystallite size (4.9 nm), and the lowest degree of agglomeration of nanocrystals in the CuO/CeO(2)composite. Besides, cyclic and water resistivity tests of this sample confirm the high stability of its catalytic activity in the CO oxidation process due to the close conjugation of the CeO(2)and CuO components in the resulting nanocomposite, confirmed by the H-2-TPR analysis results. Thus, it was shown that the optimization of Red/Ox ratio in the urea-nitrate combustion process contributes to obtaining the stable CuO/CeO(2)nanocatalyst with gradual conversion of CO at quite low temperatures (t(i) ~ 50 degrees C). We believe that the subsequent reduction of CuO loading in the Ce-Cu-O system allows creating a cost-effective and stable composite nanocatalyst with high activity even at room temperature.

TI Bimetallic PtAu superlattice arrays: Highly electroactive and durable
   catalyst for oxygen reduction and methanol oxidation reactions
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Superlattice arrays, an important type of nanomaterials, have wide applications in catalysis, optic/electronics and energy storage for the synergetic effects determined by both individual metals and collective interactions. Herein, a simple one-pot solvothermal coreduction approach is developed for facile preparation of bimetallic PtAu alloyed superlattice arrays (PtAu SLAs) in oleylamine, with the assistance of urea via hydrogen bonding induced self-assembly. Urea is essential in morphology-controlled process and prevents PtAu nanoparticles from the disordered aggregation. The characterization and formation mechanism of PtAu SLAs are investigated in details. The as-synthesized hybrid nanocrystals exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic performances for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline electrolyte in comparison with commercial Pt-C (50%, wt.%) and Pt black catalysts.

TI Synthesis and performance evaluation of various metal chalcogenides as
   active anodes for direct urea fuel cells
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Metal chalcogenides have received significant attention as electro-catalysts in different applications, due to their superior electrical conductivity and good thermal and mechanical stabilities. In this work, the optimum monocrystalline Ni-P and Ni-C, C (Se, S, O) nanosheet (NS), prepared on nickel foam as standalone anodes for urea fuel cells was introduced. The activity was investigated ex-situ and in-situ the cell. The results demonstrated that the non-oxide metal forms, i.e., Ni-P, Ni-S, and Ni-Se, have superior oxidation activity than the Ni layered double hydroxide (Ni-LDH) and Ni-O. In addition, Ni-Se showed the most superior urea oxidation activity among all prepared catalysts. Although the onset potential of all the samples was around 0.35 V vs Ag/AgCl, a steady current of 195 mAcm(-2) was recorded after 120 min using Ni-Se, which is two times higher than that of Ni-S, five times higher than Ni-O, and ten times higher than Ni-LDH. The superior activity of the Ni-Se was related to its unique crystalline structure and the high porous morphology. The performance of Ni-Se electrode under actual direct urea fuel cell (DUFC) operation using a nonprecious a Prussian blue cathode revealed 33 mWcm(-2) power, which is, one of the highest power outputs in DUFCs equipped with Ni-based anodes at room temperature, as far as the authors know.

TI Tungsten Carbide and Cobalt Modified Nickel Nanoparticles Supported on
   Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes as Highly Efficient Electrocatalysts for Urea
   Oxidation in Alkaline Electrolyte
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The tungsten carbide and cobalt-modified Ni-based catalyst [Ni-Co-WC/multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)], synthesized through a sequential impregnation method, was evaluated for the urea electrooxidation in alkaline electrolyte to reduce the overpotential and increase the current density simultaneously. The as-prepared Ni-Co-WC/MWCNTs catalyst was characterized using scanning electron microscopy-EDX, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Characterization results indicate that Ni, Co, and WC nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the MWCNTs. For the Ni-Co-WC/MWCNT electrode, the maximum current density for urea electrooxidation is more than 4 times higher than that of the Ni/C catalyst, with a reduction of 120 mV in the onset overpotential. In addition, the Ni-Co-WC/MWCNTs catalyst also shows an enhanced catalytic stability with a continuous higher current density under steady-state conditions.

TI Electrocatalytic Properties of 3D Hierarchical Graphitic Carbon- Cobalt
   Nanoparticles for Urea Oxidation
SO ACS OMEGA
AB A 3D hierarchical graphitic carbon nanostructure encapsulating cobalt(0)/cobalt oxide nanoparticles (CoGC) has been prepared by solid-state pyrolysis of a mixture of anthracene and cobalt 2,2'-bipyridine terephthalate complex at 850 degrees C. Based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner- Halenda (BJH) methods, the prepared material has high surface area (186.8 m(2) g(-1)) with an average pore width of 205.5 angstrom. XPS reveals the functionalization of carbon with different oxygen-containing groups, such as carboxylic acid groups. The presence of metallic cobalt nanoparticles with cubic and hexagonal crystalline structures encapsulated in graphitized carbon is confirmed using XRD and TEM. Raman spectroscopy indicates a graphitization degree of I-D/I-G = 1.02. CoGC was cast onto a glassy carbon electrode and used for urea electrooxidation in an alkaline solution. The electrochemical investigation shows that the newly prepared CoGC has a promising electrocatalytic activity toward urea. The specific activity is 128 mA cm(-1) mg(-1) for the electrooxidation of 0.3 M urea in 1 M KOH at a relatively low onset potential (0.31 V vs Ag/AgCl). It can be mainly attributed to the morphological structure of carbon and the high reactivity of cobalt nanoparticles. The calculated charge-transfer resistance, R-ct, of the modified electrode in the presence of urea (10.95 Omega) is significantly lower than that in the absence of urea (113.5 Omega), which indicates electrocatalytic activity. The value of charge-transfer rate constant, k(s), for the anodic reaction is 0.0058 s(-1). Electrocatalytic durability in 1000 s(-1) chronoamperometry of the modified electrode suggests high structure stability. The modified electrode retained about 60% of its activity after 100 cycles as indicated by linear sweep voltammetry.

TI Indirect urea electrooxidation by nickel(III) in alkaline medium: From
   kinetic and mechanism to reactor modeling
SO AICHE JOURNAL
AB This study consists in the determination of two kinetic laws of urea oxidation (UO) and electrooxidation (UEO) in alkaline media on nickel(III). Two kinds of active sites were examined, the first one derived from a Ni(OH)(2) powder and the second from a massive nickel electrode. Partial orders of nickel(III) (two for UO and five UEO) enable to conclude about (i) the urea adsorption on two nickel(III) sites and (ii) that a multistep oxidation of urea occurs involving five nickel(III) site electroregenerations. A multipathway mechanism is also proposed to explain UEO facilitated by the nickel(III)/nickel(II) mediation system, and to predict the by-products' formation previously identified (NO2-,NH3,OCN-,CO32-). At last, a model combining the UEO kinetic law previously established, with diffusive and convective transport phenomena was developed. A consistent correlation (maximum deviation of 6%) between laboratory electrolysis results with the model' predictions was obtained under different operating conditions, enabling the validation of this model.

TI Controlled Fabrication of Hierarchically Structured
   MnO2@NiCo-LDH Nanoarrays for Efficient Electrocatalytic Urea
   Oxidization
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Urea, a prevalent component found in wastewater, shows great promise as a substrate for energy-efficient hydrogen production by electrolysis. However, the slow kinetics of the anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) significantly hamper the overall reaction rate. This study presents the design and controlled fabrication of hierarchically structured nanomaterials as potential catalysts for UOR. The prepared MnO2@NiCo-LDH hybrid catalyst demonstrates remarkable improvements in reaction kinetics, benefiting from synergistic enhancements in charge transfer and efficient mass transport facilitated by its unique hierarchical architecture. Notably, the catalyst exhibits an exceptionally low onset potential of 1.228 V and requires only 1.326 V to achieve an impressive current density of 100 mA cm(-2), representing a state-of-the-art performance in UORs. These findings highlight the tremendous potential of this innovative material designing strategy to drive advancements in electrocatalytic processes.

   of Isocyanates from Hydroxamic Acids
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB An external oxidant-free protocol for the generation of isocyanates from hydroxamic acids assisted by trivalent phosphine under mild electrochemical conditions was reported. The process started with the anodic oxidation of hydroxamic acids, followed by reacting with phosphine to form corresponding alkoxyphosphoniums and subsequent rearrangement with the release of tri-substituted phosphine oxide as the driving force to give isocyanates, which were trapped by N-based nucleophiles to produce various ureas. This method provides a broadly applicable procedure to access isocyanate intermediates under mild electrochemical conditions.

TI How nanoparticles and submicron particles adsorb inside coating during
   plasma electrolytic oxidation of magnesium?
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB The effects of seven different additives including ethanol, methanol, glycerin, triethanolamine (TEA), urea, formamide and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were investigated on the incorporation of alumina nanoparticles (NPs) and submicron particles in plasma electrolytic oxidation of AZ31B magnesium alloy substrates. Initial results from weight changes indicate that the additives did not improve the incorporation of submicron particles, whereas the incorporation of NPs was indeed enhanced. The most efficient additive was found to be urea which resulted in the highest content of alumina NPs to be incorporated. Later, the impact of urea concentration was investigated and it was discovered that the highest incorporation of NPs occurred at 20 g/l of urea concentration, in which NPs were properly dispersed into the solution and their size was decreased. Corrosion and wear properties of films which were evaluated either with or without urea were studied. The highest content of incorporated alumina NPs was obtained at 20 g/l of urea. DLS results show that 20 g/l urea caused the lowest size of particles in the electrolyte. The highest corrosion resistance (with a current density of 1.5 mA/cm(2)) and the lowest wear rate (approximately 0.1 mu g/N.m) were achieved at 20 g/l of urea concentration.

TI Core-shell structured Ni/NiS/NiS2@C(S, N) nanocomposites: A efficient
   multi-interfaces electrocatalyst for overall urea electrolysis
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Herein, we synthesized S, N co-doped graphitic carbon-coated Ni/NiS/NiS2 (Ni/NiS/NiS2@C(S, N)) nanocomposites via the arc-discharge method combined with the sulfidation process. The as-prepared Ni/NiS/ NiS2@C(S, N) nanocomposites with unique core-shell structures and multiple interfaces exhibit highly efficient electrocatalytic capacity. They only needed the overpotential of 60 mV to afford the current density of -10 mA cm-2 towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, they required a low potential of 1.381 V at 10 mA cm-2 towards urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Even during urea electrolysis, they only needed the cell voltage of 1.45 V at 10 mA cm-2 and exhibited strong stability in the long-time test. Further, the catalytic mechanism of Ni/NiS/NiS2@C(S, N) nanocomposites was discussed in detail. The superior electrocatalytic capacity of Ni/NiS/NiS2 @C(S, N) nanocomposites towards HER, UOR, and urea electrolysis results from the synergistic effect among multiple interfaces. Such synergistic effect triggers rapid electron transfer, fast rate cleavage of H2O and urea, and improved hydrogen adsorption free energy.

TI Improvement of NOX Reduction Rate of Urea SCR System Applied
   for an Non-Road Diesel Engine
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Urea SCR technology has been widely used to reduce NOx emissions of diesel engines. Despite remarkable development for decades, more advanced control and optimization of urea SCR systems are still required as global NOx emissions standards are expected to become more stringent. This study investigated several influential parameters of urea SCR system to improve NOx reduction efficiency. This study uses a commercialized UWS (Urea Water Solution) supply system and a SCR catalyst which was installed in the exhaust line of a non-road CRDI (Common Rail Direct Injection) diesel engine. From this study, it was found that the low space velocity of SCR catalyst is essential for high NOx reduction efficiency, especially at low temperatures. Early injection of UWS enhances the overall NOx reduction efficiency if UWS injection was carefully controlled to avoid urea deposits. Rich injection of UWS with AOC is a good strategy for high NOx reduction efficiency. However, NOx reproduction in the AOC, which has an adverse effect on the overall NOx reduction rate, occurs at high exhaust gas temperatures. System insulation also can improve the NOx reduction efficiency by a few percentage points.

TI Regulating the electronic structure of
   Ni3Se4-MoSe2 by coupling with
   ZIF-derived Co@C promotes boosted urea-assisted water splitting at
   industrial current density
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Adopting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) as an alternative to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a prospective approach to achieve energy-saving H-2 generation as well as purify wastewater with abundant urea, while the industrial application of bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR still remains challenge. Herein, novel coleslaw-like arrays Ni3Se4-MoSe2/Co@C electrocatalyst is fabricated by coupling Ni3Se4-MoSe2 heterointerface with Co-ZIF derived Co@C, in which the synergistic effects of Ni3Se4-MoSe2 and Co@C can tailor the electronic state caused by Ni, Mo, Se and Co atoms, contributing to the modulated d-band center and charge redistribution, hence balancing the absorption and desorption of HER and UOR reaction intermediates and realizing facilitated HER and UOR activities. Furthermore, the coleslaw-like arrays could expose more active sites as well as speed up mass transport. As a result, Ni3Se4-MoSe2/Co@C shows ultralow potentials of 189 mV and 1.427 V to achieve industrial current density of 1000 mA.cm(-2) with small Tafel slopes of 56.5 and 30.2 mV.dec(-1) towards HER and UOR with exceptional long durability, respectively. Impressively, a remarkably decreased cell voltage of 1.98 V is seen to achieve 1000 mA.cm(-2) for urea-assisted water splitting. This study introduces a new strategy to producing non-noble-based selenides with ZIF derivative to realize bifunctional application in energy-saving H-2 production with industrial treatment of urea wastewater.

TI High-pressure investigations on urea hydrogen peroxide
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The effect of high-pressure on the crystal structure of urea hydrogen peroxide has been investigated to 30 GPa. Through in-situ Raman scattering and ADXRD measurements, a first-order phase transition is concluded at 2.5GPa, and the new phase is indexed to a triclinic phase using Rietveld refinement method. Further increase in pressure up to 30 GPa does not show any structural phase transition. From the Raman analysis, the irreversible phase transition should be correlated with the twist structure of urea in the adduct of urea and hydrogen peroxide as a result of the cooperation and competition of inter-molecular hydrogen bonds.

TI Two-dimensional CoP-Ni2P heterostructure nanosheets intertwined with
   carbon nanotubes as catalysts for enhanced hydrogen generation and urea
   oxidation
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB Electrocatalytic water splitting is an efficient way to provide green energy hydrogen (H2), and it is a challenge to prepare high-efficiency and inexpensive electrocatalysts. In this work, we constructed two-dimensional (2D) CoP-Ni2P heterostructure nanosheets intertwined with carbon nanotube (CoP-Ni2P/CNT) as bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent performance. The CoP-Ni2P/CNT exhibits the outstanding HER (an overpotential of 82 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 62.6 mV dec- 1) and OER (an overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 97.4 mV dec-1) activities. The optimal electrocatalytic performance of the CoP-Ni2P/CNT are ascribed to the following factors: i) the introduction of CNTs into electrocatalysts is helpful to reduce excessive aggregation of nanosheets and enhance the electron transport rate; ii) the 2D nanosheet structure and interface designing of CoP-Ni2P/CNT expose more active sites, which are beneficial to enhance electrocatalytic performance toward HER and OER. In a two-electrode system, the cell voltage is 1.39 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 after adding 0.1 M urea into 1 M KOH electrolyte. This obviously low voltage implies the feasibility of realizing energy-saving hydrogen production and urea degradation. All these results reveal the CoP-Ni2P/CNT is a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst toward practical application.

TI Ni2P nanoflakes for the high-performing urea oxidation
   reaction: linking active sites to a UOR mechanism
SO NANOSCALE
AB Urea electrolysis is regarded as an effective method for addressing both energy and environment issues. Herein, we successfully synthesized Ni2P nanoflakes for catalyzing the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Due to the higher electrical conductivity as well as the prevailing tendency in triggering the UOR via a direct electro-oxidation mechanism, Ni2P nanoflakes exhibit comparable UOR activity (1.33 V vs. RHE for onset-potential, and 95.47 mA center dot cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs. RHE) to the most active state-of-the-art catalysts, rendering them an effective alternative to precious metals such as Pt and Rh. The accelerated proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process caused by PO43- facilitates the in situ generation of NiOOH; thus, the UOR process is initiated at a lower onset-potential on Ni2P nanoflakes than on beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoflakes. The in situ generated NiOOH instead of the Ni2P phase in Ni2P nanoflakes functions as an active site during the UOR process, while both NiOOH and the Ni2P phase serve as active sites in the OER process. This work provides insights into the understanding of the UOR mechanism and opens a new avenue to design low-cost Ni-based phosphide UOR catalysts.

TI Ce doped Ni(OH)2/Ni-MOF nanosheets as an efficient oxygen evolution and
   urea oxidation reactions electrocatalyst
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely recognized as precursors or sacrificial templates for the synthesis of target catalysts on account of their high porosity and high active surface area. Elemental doping strategy is considered as an effective method for the synthesis of efficient and stable catalysts for electrolytic water. Therefore, in this paper, Ce-doped Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles and Ni-MOF nanosheets composites were synthesized by electrodeposition using Ni-MOF as precursor. Catalyst Ce-Ni(OH)2@Ni-MOF/NF displays excellent OER performance, requiring only 193 mV and 279 mV overpotentials to realize current densities of 10 mA cm -2 and 100 mA cm -2, respectively, while the UOR performance was very remarkable, only a potential of 1.28 V was demanded to reach a current density of 10 mA cm -2. In addition, no obvious change in the overpotential was noticed during the stability test of 16 h, indicating good stability of Ce-Ni(OH)2@Ni-MOF/NF. This study provides a meaningful reference for the design of an efficient and stable environmental friendly electrocatalyst.

TI Urea injection control strategy in urea-selective catalytic reduction
   for heavy-duty diesel engine under transient process
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH
AB A urea injection control strategy for urea-selective catalytic reduction under a transient process is investigated on a heavy-duty diesel engine test bench in this study. The aim is to improve NO (x) conversion efficiency and reduce ammonia slip. With the selective catalytic reduction system as the research object, an open thermodynamic conservation system is established. The conservation relationship in the process of urea injection, NO (x) reduction reaction, ammonia storage, and ammonia slip is investigated. The ideal target ammonia storage area and the ammonia storage characteristics during the transient process are studied. The ammonia storage area and boundary, which change with the transient temperature, are established. Correction of real-time ammonia injection is further deduced from the boundary of the area. The world harmonized transient cycle test cycle result showed that compared to feed-forward control, the NO (x) conversion efficiency increased by 16% and the NH3 slip decreased by 75% when using the proposed real-time ammonia storage-management control method.

TI Nickel 2-Methylimidazole Metal-Organic Framework Ultrathin
   Nanosheets/Titanium Carbide MXene Hybrid Nanostructure as a Bifunctional
   Electrocatalyst for Methanol and Urea Oxidation Reactions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB In the development of direct methanol and direct urea fuel cells, efficient electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are employed. These approaches are essential in fuel cell technology for addressing the rising global energy and environmental concerns. In this research, nickel 2-methylimidazole metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) and Ni-MOF-integrated titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene hybrid nanostructures (Ni-MOF/Ti3C2) were controllably synthesized via a facile solvothermal method. Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets are utilized as two-dimensional support to enhance the catalytic activity of the Ni-MOF/Ti3C2 hybrid nanostructure. Furthermore, the methanol and urea electro-oxidation activity of the Ni-MOF/Ti3C2 hybrid nanostructure is investigated. The synergistic effect between Ni-MOF and Ti3C2 MXene resulted in excellent and durable electrochemical performance. Thus, the newly synthesized electrode material exhibited high electrocatalytic activity at 0.8 V vs. Hg/HgO for methanol (166 mA cm-2) and urea electro-oxidations (161 mA cm-2). The methanol and urea oxidation rates of the Ni-MOF/Ti3C2-10 hybrid nanostructure are approximately five and three times higher than that of pure Ti3C2 MXene and pristine Ni-MOF, respectively. This work provides the potential of the Ni-MOF-integrated Ti3C2 MXene hybrid nanostructure as a promising electrocatalyst for MOR and UOR.

TI Introducing Platinum Nanoparticles on Inorganic/Organic
   Nanoheterostructures for Enhancing their Efficiency toward the
   Photoelectrochemical Urea Oxidation Reaction
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB TiO2-based inorganic/organic nanoheterostructure (NHs) photoanodes have been widely employed for visible-light-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) urea oxidation to produce hydrogen (H2). The efficiency of these NHs toward the PEC urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is further enhanced by anchoring platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) on inorganic/organic NHs. In this article, Pt nanoparticle-decorated inorganic/organic NHs (Pt@TiO2/NDIPh) were fabricated for the PEC UOR. These NHs consist of a N,N-bis(hexyl)-2,6-(phenyl)-naphthalenediimide (NDIPh) thin layer on TiO2 nanorods (TiO2/NDIPh). To these TiO2/NDIPh NHs, the Pt NPs are anchored by the magnetron sputtering technique. The Pt NPs on TiO2/NDIPh NHs act as a protective layer, increasing the stability of the NHs. The significance of introducing Pt NPs to inorganic/organic NHs is explored through PEC studies under light illumination conditions. Pt@TiO2/NDIPh NHs achieve a high current density and provide long-term stability over light illumination with 92% faradaic efficiency. The improved PEC performance of the Pt-decorated NHs was attributed to an increased separation of the photogenerated electron-hole charge carriers.

SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
AB To develop the high sensitive ion-sensitive field-effect-transistor (ISFET) urea biosensors, the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure with high electron sheet carrier concentration was utilized in this paper. Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical etching method and the oxidation method were, respectively, applied to recess the gate region and directly grow the GaxAlyO3 sensing membrane for enhancing sensing performances. Due to the progress of controlling ability from the gate-recessed region, the resulting characteristics of the gate-recessed AlGaN/GaN ISFET urea biosensors, including transconductance and sensing sensitivity, were obviously improved compared with the planar gate AlGaN/GaN ISFET urea biosensors. The maximum transconductance value and the urea sensitivity of the gate-recessed AlGaN/GaN ISFET urea biosensors were, respectively, improved to 75.9 mS/mm and 18.15 mA/pC(urea) compared with that of the planar gate ones. Compared with the planar gate structure, the maximum transconductance value and the urea sensitivity of the gate-recessed structure were improved 17.7% and 40.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the urea biosensors were, respectively, measured in the solution with various common interfering ions (glucose, K+, and Na+) to verify stability and reliability.

TI A universal approach of constructing two-dimensional transition metal
   phosphide heterostructures and the superior performance in (urea-rich)
   water electrolysis
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Transition metal phosphides have consistently shown excellent performance in electrocatalytic hydrogen production, but challenges remain in the development of efficient diverse catalysts. We designed a superhydrophilic two-dimensional (2D) TMP heterostructure with generalized approach. The phosphidation of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with controlled exfoliation yielded multiple phosphide heterostructures (Ni2P/CoP, CoP/Fe2P and Ni2P/Fe2P) of less than 5 nm, the thinnest phosphide sheet up to date. All 2D phosphide heterojunctions are superhydrophilic (theta w=10 degrees), which is more favourable for bubble desorption. Both XPS and XANES, among other characterizations, indicated the much stronger electron-donating effect of metal sites comparing with bulk analogues, resulting in the formation of highly electron-rich P sites for facilitated proton adsorption. 2D Ni2P/CoP showed superior activity (eta 10=46.1 mV) for hydrogen production. Interestingly, 2D Ni2P/CoP was also highly active (eta 50=112.1 mV) for urea oxidation. This work demonstrates a versatile method for building superhydrophilic 2D phosphides, opening up exciting opportunities for multifunctional applications.

TI Local Charge Distribution Engineered by Schottky Heterojunctions toward
   Urea Electrolysis
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Urea electrooxidation with favorable thermodynamic potential offers great promise for decoupling H-2/O-2 evolution from sluggish water splitting, and simultaneously mitigating the problem of urea-rich water pollution. However, the intrinsically slow kinetics of the six-electron transfer process impels one to explore efficient catalysts in order to enable widespread use of this catalytic system. In response, taking CoS2/MoS2 Schottky heterojunctions as the proof-of-concept paradigm, a catalytic model to modulate the surface charge distribution for synergistically facilitating the adsorption and fracture of chemical group in urea molecule is proposed and the mechanism of urea electrooxidation at the molecular level is elucidated. Based on density functional calculations, the self-driven charge transfer across CoS2/MoS2 heterointerface would induce the formation of local electrophilic/nucleophilic region, which will intelligently adsorb electron-donating/electron-withdrawing groups in urea molecule, activate the chemical bonds, and thus trigger the decomposition of urea. Benefiting from the regulation of local charge distribution, the constructed Schottky catalyst of CoS2-MoS2 exhibits superior urea catalytic activities with a potential of 1.29 V (only 0.06 V higher than the thermodynamic voltage of water decomposition) to attain 10 mA cm(-2) as well as robust durability over 60 h. This innovational manipulation of charge distribution via Schottky heterojunction provides a model in exploring other highly efficient electrocatalysts.

TI Electrochemical Synthesis of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate and Nickel Sulfide
   on Nickel Foam as Sustainable Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Generation
   via Urea Electrolysis
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB A promising approach to energy-efficient hydrogen production is coupling the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), significantly reducing the energy requirements. However, achieving a low-cost yet high-performance electrocatalyst for both HER and UOR remains challenging. Here, we present a facile method for synthesizing nanoporous nickel sulfide (NiS) and nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) nanocubes directly on nickel foam (NF) without any added nickel source using a cyclic voltammetry technique. In this approach, NF serves simultaneously as the substrate and nickel source, streamlining the synthesis process. The unique nanoarchitecture of NiHCF and NiS promotes highly efficient catalytic activity for both UOR and HER. NiHCF catalyzes urea oxidation by dual active sites of Ni and Fe with its synergistic interaction, without the formation of NiOOH or FeOOH. For hydrogen production, the self-supporting NiHCF/NF||NiS/NF-coupled system achieves a notably low cell voltage of 1.8 V at 100 mA cm-2, which is approximately 487 mV lower than traditional IrO2/NF||Pt/C/NF water electrolysis. This innovative electrochemical method enables the controlled synthesis of Ni-based nanoelectrocatalysts, offering a sustainable, energy-efficient pathway for H2 production from urea-rich wastewater. This environmentally friendly strategy holds significant potential to reduce the global carbon footprint, paving the way for a greener future.

Therefore, it is essential to develop a new type of odour inhibitor that has both adsorption and oxidation functions and can effectively block odour. In this study, bentonite-modified cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was synthesised, and the structural changes of bentonite before and after modification were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and other characterisation methods. Urea peroxide was loaded on modified bentonite (150C-Bent) by in situ synthesis method, and the preparation conditions were optimised. The effects of temperature, humidity and species on the adsorption behaviour and adsorption kinetics were studied by adsorption experiments. It is demonstrated that CTAB is embedded in bentonite through ion exchange, and the interlayer spacing expands from 1.42 to 3.11 nm. The optimal loading mass ratio of modified bentonite to urea peroxide was 1:1.5 and pH was 3. When the relative humidity is 54.3% and the temperature is 55 degrees C, the removal effect of paraxylene is the best; the optimal removal reached 82.4%. The adsorption behaviour of 1.5UHP-Bent conforms to the pseudo-second-order kinetic adsorption model. The adsorption pathway of paraxylene on UHP-Bent mainly includes partition effect and hydroxyl radical capture.

   oxidation
SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB A new pseudopolymeric nanomagnetic catalyst containing urea linkers, namely Fe3O4@SiO2@[(CH2)(3)-urea-(CH2)(2)-O-(CH2)](2), was synthesized. The mentioned nanomagnetic catalyst was characterized by using several methods including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric/differential thermogravimetric analysis, vibrating sample magnetometer analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. In this research, we examined the catalytic usage of Fe3O4@SiO2@[(CH2)(3)-urea-(CH2)(2)-O-(CH2)](2) for the preparation of a wide range of 2-amino-3-cyano and 2-hydroxy-3-cyanopyridine derivatives bearing thiophene or furan moieties. All desired hybrid pyridines were synthesized in short reaction times with high yields. The crucial finding is that the catalyst was very efficient, stable, and easy retrieve. In addition, a vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation pathway is suggested as a mechanism for the preparation of target molecules.

TI Sn-induced electronic structure engineering of NiFe LDH for stable and
   efficient oxygen evolution reaction and urea oxidation reaction
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Water splitting and urea splitting are two of the most promising ways to produce clean energy. In this experiment, the presence of the Sn ion is regulated by modulating the amount of ion introduced, so as to investigate its influence on the electrochemical performance of this NiFe LDH electrode. Different forms of Sn ions will affect the electrochemical performance of NiFe LDH materials, so the effects of ions on NiFe LDH materials can be discussed through doping or the construction of heterogeneous interfaces. What is noteworthy is that when Sn is doped as an ion, the Sn-NiFe LDH/NF electrode exhibited superior oxygen evolution (overpotential of 260 mV@10 mA cm-2) and urea oxidation (potential of 1.35 V@10 mA cm-2) properties. Sn-induced electronic structure engineering is beneficial to adjust the adsorption of reaction intermediates and improve conductivity, hence enhancing catalytic activity. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the promoted performance of the Sn-NiFe LDH/NF electrode can be assigned to the rapid electron transfer rate, improved electrical conductivity and the construction of Sn-induced electronic structure engineering. This work will propose novel insights into how the presence of ions affects the catalytic activity of materials.

TI Improved Sensing Performance of Amperometric Urea Biosensor by Using
   Platinum Nanoparticles
SO ELECTROANALYSIS
AB A novel Platinum nanoparticle (PtNPs) modified Poly(pyrrole-co-1-(2-Aminophenyl)pyrrole)/Urease film coated Au electrode was designed for amperometric detection of urea. PtNPs quantity, film density and pH were optimized and interference effect of some substances readily found in municipal wastewater and blood was investigated. The biosensor responded to urea with a measurement concentration range of 0.1 to 30 mM, a sensitivity of 31.8 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), a LOD of 7.58 mu M, an accuracy of 104 % and a RSD% of only 0.82. It sensed the concentration of urea in the municipal sewage water with recovery of 97.6 % (n=3) and remained 78 % of its initial response at 28(th) day. Results confirmed that PtNPs with strong conductivity improved the electron transfer ability of the working electrode.

AB This work illustrates a high-performance Urea sensor using Cys-GO (L-Cysteine functionalized GO) as a sensing material. The device is fabricated using the standard lithography process. The device has an additional feature of liquid holding, which increases sensing performance. The morphological and structural characterization of Cys-GO is investigated to ensure the bonding between L-Cysteine and GO.

TI Revealing Adsorption Conformation and Electro-oxidation Mechanism of
   Urea on the Ni Film Catalyst by In Situ ATR-SEIRAS
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is considered as a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction due to its lower thermodynamic equilibrium potential (0.37 V). Nickel (Ni)-based catalysts have been universally used for UOR due to their lower cost and higher catalytic activity. However, the lack of mechanistic clarity has limited the study of catalyst constructional relationship. Herein, electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection-surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy was utilized to investigate the adsorption conformation and the reaction mechanism of UOR on the Ni-based catalyst. Combining CO((NH2)-N-15)(2) isotopic experiments and polarization spectra method, the O-terminal adsorbed structure of urea, *O= C(NH2)(2), was unveiled as a reaction precursor. Moreover, with the potential increasing, *O= C(NH2)(2) was converted to the N-terminal adsorbed structure, *NHCONH2, which was oxidized to generate CO2 and N-2 by undergoing dehydrogenation. The finding could promote the knowledge of the reaction mechanism of UOR on Ni-based catalysts, which is conducive to the further design of high-performance catalysts for urea oxidation.

TI Dual-doping NiMoO4 with multi-channel structure enable urea-assisted
   energy-saving H2 production at large current density in alkaline
   seawater
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB Seawater electrolysis is an efficient method for producing carbon-neutral hydrogen; however, it is hindered by high energy cost and chlorine evolution reaction. In this study, we report Ru, P dual-doped NiMoO4 multichannel nanorods in-situ grown on nickel foam (Ru/P-NiMoO4 @NF), which can achieve chlorine-free hydrogen production by coupling seawater splitting with thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation. The Ru/P-NiMoO4 @NF exhibits bifunctional activity with working potentials of 0.23 V to deliver 3000 mA cm-2 for HER and 1.46 V to deliver 1000 mA cm-2 for UOR. The overall urea splitting system in the two-electrode electrolyzer require low voltage of 1.73 V to drive 500 mA cm-2, and demonstrate remarkable durability to keep above 100 mA cm-2 for 145 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that dual-doping modulate the D-band center of catalyst, thus enhancing the adsorption of reactants and intermediates. This work provides information for designing catalysts for combing seawater splitting with urea purification.

TI Synergistically Interfaced Bifunctional Transition Metal Selenides for
   High-Rate Hydrogen Production Via Urea Electrolysis
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB The realization of carbon-neutral energy is regarded a prime challenge as the environment and energy have become two key issues facing modern society. Here, synergistically interfaced transition metal selenides are studied for hydrogen production via urea electrolysis with concurrent environmental treatment. Extremely low overpotentials of 210 mV, 250 mV, and 1.41 V vs. RHE were observed at 100 mA cm(-2) for HER, OER and UOR, respectively with a 98.3 % faradaic efficiency. A notably low cell voltage of 1.6 and 1.84 V was required at 200 mA cm(-2) for urea and water electrolysis, respectively along with a remarkably stable performance for 4 days. Additionally, A 1.45-fold increase in H-2 production rate was observed for urea electrolysis [26.6 mu mol min(-1)] when compared with water electrolysis [18 mu mol min(-1)] decreasing the power consumption by 37 %. Real human urine electrolysis was conducted with excellent performance requiring a cell voltage of only 1.9 V at 200 mA cm(-2), attributed to the synergistic intermediate-active site interaction, improved charge transfer capability, and slow surface transformation-induced activation.

TI Efficient hydrogen production via urea electrolysis with cobalt doped
   nickel hydroxide-riched hybrid films: Cobalt doping effect and mechanism
   aspect
SO JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB The exploration of earth-abundant catalysts that are highly active and robustly stable for urea electro-oxidation is critical for energy-efficient hydrogen production associated with urea-rich wastewater purification. Herein, Co-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) hybrid films with unique ultrafine nanoparticles assembled network structure are constructed as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea-assisted water electrolysis. By employing a facile potentiodynamic deposition route carried out in a deep eutectic solvent (Ethaline), ultrafine Ni-based nanoparticles with a alpha-Ni(OH)(2) rich surface doping by Co are in-situ grown on Cu foam substrate (Co-x-Ni(OH)(2) NPs/CF), creating an integrated electrode full of intimate contact interfaces. The doping of Co triggers a structural transition with electronic structure changes at the electrode surface and lowers the onset potential required for Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH, which strongly enhances the urea electrolysis activity. Through potential conditioning procedure, the optimized Co-0.26-Ni(OH)(2) NPs/CF catalyst (with a Ni/Co proportion of 1:0.26) manifests excellent electrocatalytic performance for urea electrolysis in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, presenting a low onset potential of 1.27 V vs. RHE for urea oxidation and an overpotential of 106 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2). Impressively, the constructed alkaline urea electrolyzer based on Co-0.26-Ni(OH)(2) NPs/CF delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at a stable output voltage of 1.42 V with robust durability over 38 h and high selectivity.

TI Easy-to-prepare electrochemical platform composed of ionic liquid-Ni
   (II)-graphite composites: laboratory study on electrochemical oxidation
   of urea, alcohols, and glucose
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Ni(II) was introduced into four room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), namely 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium salicylate (BMI-SAL), BMI hexafluorophosphate (BMI-PF6), 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide (BMP-DCA), and BMP bis((trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl) imide (BMP-TFSI), via the addition of NiCl2 or the anodic dissolution of Ni metal. The RTILs containing different Ni(II) species were mixed with pure and fine graphite (GP) powder to form RTIL/Ni(II)/GP composites, which were used to prepare composite electrodes for the electrocatalytic oxidation of urea, alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, and glycerol), and glucose. Ni(II) produced from the anodic dissolution of Ni metal in BMP-TFSI showed the best activity. The BMP-TFSI/Ni(II)(anodization)/GP composite thus has potential as an easy-to-prepare electrochemical platform for the electrochemical oxidation of the above-mentioned compounds. The oxidation and determination of urea using the BMP-TFSI/Ni(II)(anodization)/GP composite electrode was thoroughly studied. A very high sensitivity of 517 mu A.mM(-1).cm(-2) was obtained. This electrode also showed good stability during the anodic electrolysis of the aforementioned compounds, indicating that it may be appropriate as an anode for the electrolysis of urea, alcohols, and glucose.

TI Ti-Mesh supported porous CoS2 nanosheet self-interconnected
   networks with high oxidation states for efficient hydrogen production
   via urea electrolysis
SO NANOSCALE
AB The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an ideal alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) towards energy efficient hydrogen production. However developing Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for urea oxidation and hydrogen generation still remains a big challenge. Herein, porous CoS2 nanosheet self-interconnected networks with high oxidation states located on a Ti-mesh (P-CoS2/Ti) are synthesized and can act as a high activity catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this literature, we report a very interesting phenomenon that cobalt hydroxide with different chemical compositions and crystal structures can be synthesized by adjusting the concentration of NaOH during the etching process. Moreover, porous CoS2 nanosheets with different crystallite sizes can be synthesized by adjusting the sulfuration temperature. P-CoS2/Ti presents outstanding catalytic performance with an overpotential of 91 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER, and it gives an anode potential of 1.243 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) for the UOR. A two-electrode electrolyser is used to validate the catalyst performance, and the P-CoS2/Ti||P-CoS2/Ti electrode is capable of producing a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell potential of only 1.375 V, demonstrating its potential feasibility in the practical application of efficient hydrogen production.

TI Suppression of Passivation on Nickel Hydroxide in Electrocatalytic Urea
   Oxidization
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Surface passivation of Ni-based electrocatalysts during the electrocatalytic urea oxidization reaction (UOR) renders them impractical and inefficient for applications requiring high current densities. Herein, an efficient strategy to suppress passivation of Ni(OH)x nanosheets is demonstrated by modulating the near-surface properties using plasma immersion ion implantation, and more importantly, the formation threshold of the UOR-active gamma-NiOOH phase is retained. As a result, a remarkable UOR current density of up to 470 mA cm-2 is achieved from the La ion implanted sample, due to the mitigation of passivation, increase in operando active sites, and acceleration of the catalytic kinetics. By performing a systematic assessment with a multitude of operando, quasi-operando, and time-varying methods, the gamma-NiOOH derived from Ni(OH)x is shown to undergo surface deprotonation at high potentials consequently leading to the occurrence of OER as well as UOR passivation. Furthermore, the implanted La ions are capable of stabilizing protons to sustain UOR.
   An innovative strategy is described to mitigate surface passivation of Ni-based electrocatalysts during the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR). La plasma immersion ion implantation is performed to modulate the near-surface properties of Ni(OH)x nanosheets, resulting in a remarkable UOR current density and suppression of competitive oxygen evolution. The stabilizing effect of the implanted La ions on protons enables sustained UOR.image

TI CTAB-Assisted Synthesis of FeNi Alloy Nanoparticles: Effective and
   Stable Electrocatalysts for Urea Oxidation Reactions
SO LANGMUIR
AB Development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for treating urea-rich wastewater is an important problem in environmental management and energy production. In this work, an iron-nickel alloy (Fe-Ni alloy) was synthesized via soft-template cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-assisted precipitation using low-temperature calcination. The as-synthesized nanoalloy was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), which revealed the formation of a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of the Fe-Ni alloy; field emission-scanning electron microscopic (FE-SEM) analysis revealed the spherical shape of the Fe-Ni alloy; high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) revealed the average size to be similar to 33.09 nm; and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed the presence of Fe, Ni, C, and O components and their chemical composition and valence states in the Fe-Ni alloy. The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) was investigated by conducting linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests on the synthesized electrocatalysts with different Ni/Fe ratios in alkaline electrolytes with urea. The potential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 1.27 V vs RHE, which demonstrates the higher electrochemical activity of the Fe-Ni alloy compared to other individual compounds. This could be due to CTAB which improved the structural stability and synergetic and electronic effects in the nanoscale. This study will further contribute to renewable energy generation technology with long-term energy sustainability and also opens up great potential for reducing water pollution.

TI Urea-dithiocarbamic acid functionalized magnetic nanoparticles modified
   with Ch-Cl: Catalytic application for the synthesis of novel hybrid
   pyridones via cooperative geminal-vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS
AB This investigation was focused on the novel magnetic nanoparticles anchored deep eutectic solvent namely Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3-urea-dithiocarbamic acid/Ch-Cl as a heterogeneous catalyst. The formation of the catalyst was confirmed by several techniques including FT-IR spectroscopy, FE-SEM, TEM, EDX, ele-mental mapping, TGA/DTG and VSM analysis. Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3-urea-dithiocarbamic acid/Ch-Cl was applied as environmentally sustainable and recoverable catalyst for the synthesis of novel hybrid pyri-dones containing triazole and sulfonamide moieties. X-ray crystallography was also used for the accurate determination of the structure of hybrid pyridones. In addition, based on revealed results, pyridone iso-mer was solely confirmed compared to its relevant tautomer (pyridine). In the current study, cooperative geminal-vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation concept has been used for suggesting a plausible mecha-nism for the synthesis of target molecules. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Promoting High-Oxidation-State Metal Active Sites in a Hollow Ternary
   Metal Fluoride Nanoflake Array for Urea Electrolysis
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The adsorption ability of hydrogen, hydroxide, and oxygenicintermediatesplays a crucial role in electrochemical water splitting. Electron-deficientmetal-active sites can prompt electrocatalytic activity by improvingthe adsorption ability of intermediates. However, it remains a significantchallenge to synthesize highly abundant and stable electron-deficientmetal-active site electrocatalysts. Herein, we present a general approachto synthesizing a hollow ternary metal fluoride (FeCoNiF2) nanoflake array as an efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalystfor the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction(UOR). We find that the F anion withdraws electrons from the metalcenters, inducing an electron-deficient metal center catalyst. Therationally designed hollow nanoflake array exhibits the overpotentialof 30 mV for HER and 130 mV for UOR at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and superior stability without decay eventsover 150 h at a large current density of up to 100 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, the assembled urea electrolyzer using a bifunctionalhollow FeCoNiF2 nanoflake array catalyst requires cellvoltages of only 1.352 and 1.703 V to afford current densities of10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are 116mV less compared with that required for overall water splitting.

TI Thermodynamic analysis of hydrogen-rich syngas production with a mixture
   of aqueous urea and biodiesel
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB An auxiliary power unit based on a solid oxidation fuel cell for heavy-duty vehicles has been receiving attention for high efficiency, low emissions, and more comfort and safety in vehicles. This study explores hydrogen-rich syngas production via reforming of a mixture of aqueous urea and biodiesel by thermodynamics analysis. The aqueous urea is available from Adblue used in a selective catalyst reduction providing efficient control of nitrogen oxides from heavy-duty vehicles to minimize particulate mass and optimize fuel consumption. The results show that at a reaction temperature of 700 degrees C, urea/biodiesel ratio = 3, and oxygen/biodiesel ratio = 9, the highest reforming efficiency is 83.78%, H-2 production 30.43 mol, and CO production 12.68 mol. This study verified that aqueous urea could successfully replace the steam in autothermal reforming, which provides heat and increases syngas production, and reforming aqueous urea mixed with biodiesel has ultra-low sulfur, low carbon and little modifying the fuel system.

TI Prepared Reticulated Nickel Hydroxide for Sensing Urea by Differential
   Pulse Voltammetry
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A urea sensor base on reticulated nickel hydroxide is prepared by hydrothermal way and operated by differential pulse voltammetry method. The reticulated nickel hydroxide has been successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method and has been characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The Ni(OH)(2) sensor exhibits a higher sensor response (S) of 7.1 than NiO and Au sensing materials to 0.05 M urea concentration at 0.62 V. Various concentration of urea from 0.1 mM to 50 mM are performed on Ni(OH)(2), and the sensor response are increased from 1.1 to 7.1 by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) method. The urea detection limit is measured as 0.1 mu M in this system. In addition, the Ni(OH)(2) sensor exhibited good reproducibility and short term stability, and the response exhibits no obvious changes after 20 days tests. A possible sensing mechanism of Ni(OH)(2) urea sensor is presented.

TI A novel chitosan-urea encapsulated material for persulfate slow-release
   to degrade organic pollutants
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB A novel eco-friendly material (CS-U@PS) for persulfate slow-release to effectively degrade organic pollutants (methyl orange and pyrene) was synthesized using chitosan and urea as the encapsulated framework materials via an emulsion cross-linking method for the first time. The obtained CS-U@PS exhibits spherical shapes with a uniform size of approximately 2-3 mu m according to the particle-size distribution and SEM image results. The slow-release mechanism was proposed through a kinetics model study and the Ritger-Peppas model fit well (r2 = 0.9699) to indicate that the slow-release process is non-Fickian diffusion. The influences of urea and PS dosages and oxidative conditions on methyl orange degradation were studied, and all the results suggested that urea played an important role in PS slow-release and can also catalyze the activation of PS by iron to further produce radicals and improve the removal efficiency of pollutants. A pyrene removal rate of 90.53% was achieved in aqueous solutions and an above 80% removal rate was obtained in weakly acidic or neutral soil environments by CS-U@PS activated by Fe2+ with citric acid as the chelating agent. Therefore, the fabricated slow-release oxidation materials exhibit application potential for the remediation of organic polluted groundwater and soil.

TI Nitric oxide removal from flue gas by ferrate(VI)/urea solutions
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB In this work, nitric oxide absorption process by using ferrate(VI)/urea was proposed. The respective influences of the four factors including pH value, ferrate(VI) concentration, urea concentration, and the temperature and the interactive function of them on nitric oxide absorption were investigated with the response surface methodology (RSM) by central composite design (CCD). The proposed model system showed good consistency with the experiment results, by a correlated coefficient (R-2) of 0.9875. In addition, the interactive influences between any two variables were elaborated through analysis of response surface. The optimal parameters were found at pH of 7.1, reaction temperature of 43.8 degrees C, urea concentration of 6.3 wt%, ferrate(VI) concentration of 4.4 mmol/L for 85.2% NO absorption. Finally, N containing product analysis shows that nitric oxide was primarily transformed to N-2 and NO3-.

TI Balancing dynamic evolution of active sites for urea oxidation in
   practical scenarios
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Electrochemical urea splitting provides a sustainable and environmentally benign route for facilitating energy conversion. Nonetheless, the sustained efficiency of urea splitting is impeded by a scarcity of active sites during extended operational periods. Herein, an atomic heterostructure engineering strategy is proposed to promote the generation of active species via synthesizing unique Ru-O4 coordinated single atom catalysts anchored on Ni hydroxide (Ru1-Ni(OH)2), with ultralow Ru loading mass of 40.6 mu g cm-2 on the nickel foam for commercial feasibility. Leveraging in situ spectroscopic characterizations, the structure-performance relationship in low and high urea concentrations was investigated and exhibited extensive universality. The boosted generation of dynamic Ni3+ active sites ensures outstanding activity and prominent long-term durability tests in various practical scenarios, including 100 h Zn-urea-air battery operation, 100 h alkaline urine electrolysis, and over 400 h stable hydrogen production in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system under industrial-level current density.

TI Hierarchical Flower-like NiFeSbP Electrocatalyst toward Efficient and
   Stable Urea-Assisted Electrolytic Hydrogen Production
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Designing high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting and urea-assisted electrolysis is of great significance in the hydrogen production industry. Herein, a hierarchical flower-like NiFeSbP electrocatalyst with different Ni/Fe ratios was fabricated on a graphite bar (GB) through a one-step electrodeposition method. By optimizing and regulating the ratios of Ni and Fe in the composition, the NiFeSbP electrocatalyst exhibited excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activities with overpotentials of 143, 323, and 272 mV at 100 mA.cm(-2), sequentially, and also demonstrated longevity for over 100 h in an alkaline solution. More impressively, a symmetrical electrolyzer using NiFeSbP/GB as both the anode and cathode to afford a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) needs 1.72 V for overall water splitting and 1.54 V for urea-assisted electrolysis. The superior catalytic performances of the NiFeSbP/GB catalyst in the urea-added water electrolysis mainly benefit from the synergistic effect between tricomponent metal catalytic centers (Ni, Fe, and Sb) and P atoms, which modulates the chemical and electronic structure of the catalyst. This work opens up new prospects for the rational design of versatile and stable UOR electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation in an efficient manner.

TI Ionic liquid crystals/nano-nickel oxide-decorated carbon nanotubes
   composite for electrocatalytic treatment of urea-contaminated water
SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Electrochemical treatment is an efficient approach for urea-decontamination from aqueous media. Reliable electro-catalysts are therefore crucial for water decontamination applications. We introduce in this work a newly developed composite by modifying a nickel substrate with nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and ionic liquid crystals (ILCs). The composite modifier (Ni/NiO + CNTs) exhibit an outstanding specific catalytic current for 0.33 M urea electm-oxidation in 1 M KOH of 1303 A.g(-1).cm(-2). The optimum regime of the catalyst administration to the substrate surface is a layer of ILCs followed by a mixture of CNTs and NiO with a ratio of 1:1 by mass (Ni/ILCs/NiO CNTs (1:1)). The inclusions of ILCs assist the ionic exchange of the electrode surface and increase substantially the performance of the catalyst. The change in the carbon-based component of the catalyst affects the electro-catalytic current; reduced graphene oxide (RGO) exhibit relatively lower value compared to CNTs. The Tafel slope, the exchange current density, charge transfer coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and heterogeneous rate constant in 0.33 M urea/1.0 M KOH for the optimized electrode (Ni/ILCs/NiO CNTs (1:1)) are: 33.0 mV.dec(-1), 2.89 x 10(-5) A.cm(-2), 0.91, 1.70 x 10(-3) cm(2).s(-1), 1.51 x 10(5) mol(-1).L.s(-1), respectively. The calculated activation energy of the electrochemical conversion of urea is 5.28 k.J.mol(-1). The electrode shows high stability when used for extended time to constant applied potential of about +0.5 V for urea electro-oxidation. The conversion efficiency increased in the order Ni/ILC5/NiO CNTs > Ni/NiO CNTs > Ni/NiO compared to the Ni surface.

TI Mono-coordinated metallocene ligands endow metal-organic frameworks with
   highly efficient oxygen evolution and urea electrolysis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are generally recognized as promising platforms for energy conversion and storage due to their structural diversity and ligands tunability features, yet there are still challenges before practical applications become possible. Herein, a two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) with mono-coordinated ferrocenecarboxylic acid (Fc) is successfully prepared. Different from the pure MOF, the as-prepared Fc-MOF offers remarkable electrocatalytic activity, exhibiting a low overpotential of 273 mV (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) at 200 mA cm(-2) and a small driving potential of 1.49 V (10 mA cm(-2)) for the overall water splitting with Pt/C as a counterpart cathode. The advance nature of the as-prepared Fc-MOF could also be evidenced by its remarkable Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity as it drives a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a potential of 1.35 V. Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of highly electronegative Fc not only change the electronic structure of MOF but also expose more unsaturated active sites, which in turn varies the adsorption features of the intermediate species during the catalytic process. This work represents a new pathway for exploration of highly efficient MOF based electrocatalysts.

TI Cobalt Nitride Supported on Nickel Foam as Bifunctional Catalyst
   Electrodes for Urea Electrolysis-Assisted Hydrogen Generation
SO NANO
AB Replacing the high theoretical potential of anodic water decomposition (oxygen evolution reaction) with the low theoretical potential of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an urgent need for hydrogen energy storage and conversion. Cobalt nitride nanoflakes, high-performance bifunctional catalysts supported on nickel foam (Co-5.47 N NF/NF), were synthesized by hydrothermal and calcination method. The morphology and composition of the catalyst were studied by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and elemental analysis. In order to conduct electrochemical performance and stability, a two-electrode electrolyzer composed of Co-5.47 N NF/NF as both anode and cathode materials is constructed (Co-5.47 N NF/NF parallel to Co-5.47 N NF/NF). Only a voltage of 1.687 V is needed to complete 100 mA.cm(-2). It is much lower than the voltage of Pt/C parallel to IrO2 (1.816 V), because of which it is believed that this work provides a valuable route for the design of inexpensive and efficient urea electrolysis-assisted hydrogen generation.

TI Nickel borate with a 3D hierarchical structure as a robust and efficient
   electrocatalyst for urea oxidation†
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO
AB Water electrolysis has become a promising green and sustainable strategy for hydrogen fuel production. However, due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), large overpotentials are required to drive the overall reaction. In this work, we demonstrate an environmentally friendly and energy-saving strategy by the synergy of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to replace the ordinary water hydrolysis. In order to further boost the UOR kinetics, nickel borate (Ni-B-i) is synthesized by a facile co-precipitation method, forming a nanosheet morphology and 3D hierarchical porous structure. The resulting Ni-B-i catalyst exhibits exceptionally high catalytic performance for the UOR, achieving a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at 1.42 V vs. RHE, which is about 250 mV lower than that of the OER process. The two-electrode urea electrolytic cell composed of the Ni-B-i anode and a Pt cathode requires a small cell voltage of 1.66 V in order to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and is very stable. Overall, this work demonstrates a promising electrocatalyst system for efficient hydrogen production and simultaneous urea-containing wastewater treatment, providing valuable information for the development of advanced non-noble metal catalysts for the UOR.

The dilution-extinction procedure on culture A31 led to the isolation of a strain that was designated as Nitrobacter sp. A67. The nxrB] gene sequence of Nitrobacter sp. A67 (302 bp) was classified into Cluster 5, and the highest sequence identity was 96.10% with Nitrobacter sp. BS5/19. The NO2- oxidation activity of Nitrobacter sp. A67 was investigated at various pH. The optimum pH for NO2- oxidation was 5.8-6.4. This result indicates that Nitrobacter sp. A67 is a moderately acidophilic nitrite-oxidizing bacterium.

TI Influences of tungsten incorporation, morphology and calcination
   temperature on the electrocatalytic activity of Ni/C nanostructures
   toward urea elimination from wastewaters
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Electrooxidation of urea is an efficient methodology for the production of hydrogen with a simultaneous treatment of urea-containing wastewaters. In this study, tungsten was suggested as a co-catalyst to foster the activity of Ni/C nanostructures in the process of urea electro-oxidation. Beside optimization of the co-catalyst content, influences of the nano-morphology and the synthesis temperature have been investigated. The results indicated that WNi nanoparticles-incorporated carbon nanofibers can be produced from calcination of electrospun mats composed of nickel acetate, tungsten chloride, and ploy (vinyl alcohol). Compared to the nanoparticles, the morphology of nanofibrous was strongly foster the electrocatalytic activity. The W-free and the prepared, from calcination of an electrospun solution containing 10 wt% WCl2 at 850 degrees C, nanofibers give better performance compared to the nanoparticles having similar compositions. Compared to the nanoparticles, the nanofibrous morphology results in increasing the current density from 11.5 to 16 mA/cm(2) (28% increase) and from 22 to 37.75 mA/cm(2) (42% increase) for the pristine and W- containing catalyst, respectively. Studying the influence of the metallic nanoparticles composition indicated that the tungsten content strongly affects the electrocatalytic activity; the nanofibers prepared from electrospun solution containing 35 wt% tungsten precursor reveal the best performance. Investigating the effect of the calcination temperature indicated that 1000 degrees C is the optimum temperature compared to 700 and 850 degrees C. Numerically, for 10 wt% co-catalyst sample, the current density was duplicated four times when the calcination temperature increased from 850 to 1000 degrees C. Studying the kinetic of urea oxidation reaction concluded that the activation energy is -17 kJ/mol. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Highly efficient overall urea electrolysis via single-atomically active
   centers on layered double hydroxide
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an intriguing half reaction that can replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and work together with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) toward simultaneous hydrogen fuel generation and urea-rich wastewater purification; however, it remains a challenge to achieve overall urea electrolysis with high efficiency. Herein, we report a multifunctional electrocatalyst termed as Rh/NiV-LDH, through integration of nickel-vanadium layered double hydroxide (LDH) with rhodium single-atom catalyst (SAC), to achieve this goal. The electrocatalyst delivers high HER mass activity of 0.262 A mg(-1) and exceptionally high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.125 s(-1)at an overpotential of 100 mV. Moreover, exceptional activity toward urea oxidation is addressed, which requires a potential of 1.33 V to yield 10 mA cm(-2), endorsing the potential to surmount the sluggish OER. The splendid catalytic activity is enabled by the synergy of the NiV-LDH support and the atomically dispersed Rh sites (located on the Ni-V hollow sites) as evidenced both experimentally and theoretically. The self -supported Rh/NiV-LDH catalyst serving as the anode and cathode for overall urea electrolysis (1 mol L-1 KOH with 0.33 mol L-1 urea as electrolyte) only requires a small voltage of 1.47 V to deliver 100 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability. This work provides important insights into multifunctional SAC design from the perspective of support sites toward overall electrolysis applications. (c) 2022 Science China Press.

TI Double Hydroxide Nanocatalysts for Urea Electrooxidation Engineered
   toward Environmentally Benign Products
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Recent advancements in the electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) present promising avenues for wastewater remediation and energy recovery. Despite progress toward optimized efficiency, hurdles persist in steering oxidation products away from environmentally unfriendly products, mostly due to a lack of understanding of structure-selectivity relationships. In this study, the UOR performance of Ni and Cu double hydroxides, which show marked differences in their reactivity and selectivity is evaluated. CuCo hydroxides predominantly produce N2, reaching a current density of 20 mA cmgeo-2 at 1.04 V - 250 mV less than NiCo hydroxides that generate nitrogen oxides. A collection of in-situ spectroscopies and scattering experiments reveal a unique in situ generated Cu(2-x)+-OO-center dot active sites in CuCo, which initiates nucleophilic substitution of NH2 from the amide, leading to N-N coupling between *NH on Co and Cu. In contrast, the formation of nitrogen oxides on NiCo is primarily attributed to the presence of high-valence Ni3+ and Ni4+, which facilitates N-H activation. This process, in conjunction with the excessive accumulation of OH- ions on Jahn-Teller (JT) distorted Co sites, leads to the generation of NO2- as the primary product. This work underscores the importance of catalyst composition and structural engineering in tailoring innocuous UOR products.
   Electrochemical urea oxidation offers potential for wastewater remediation and energy recovery, but challenges persist in controlling reaction products due to limited structure-selectivity understanding. In article number 2403187, the authors used in situ characterization methods to showcase that CuCo double hydroxide's unique superoxo active redox sites facilitate high N2 selectivity, while NiCo double hydroxide's high-valence Ni sites promote nitrogen oxide formation. image

TI Effect of reactor configuration on the kinetics and nitrogen byproduct
   selectivity of urea electrolysis using a boron doped diamond electrode
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Electrochemical systems have emerged as an advantageous approach for decentralized management of source-separated urine with the possibility of recovering or removing nutrients and generating energy. In this study, the kinetics and byproduct selectivity of the electrolytic removal of urea were investigated using a boron doped diamond working electrode under varied operational conditions with a primary focus on comparing undivided and divided reactors. The urea removal rate in the undivided and divided reactors was similar, but the divided reactor had an increased required cell voltage needed to maintain the equivalent current density. The current efficiency was similar for 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 A (333, 83.3, 167 mA/cm(2)), suggesting no interference from competing reactions at higher potentials. In a divided reactor, increasing the anolyte pH reduced the urea removal rate presumably from hydroxyl radical scavenging by hydroxide. Further, for all divided reactor experiments, the final pH was less than 1, suggesting that the transport of protons across the ion exchange membrane to the cathode was slower than the oxidation reactions producing protons. The nitrogen byproduct selectivity was markedly different in the undivided and divided reactors. In both reactors, nitrate (NON) formed as the main byproduct at the anode, but in the undivided reactor it was reduced at the stainless steel cathode to ammonia. In the presence of 1 M chloride, the urea removal kinetics improved from the generation of reactive chlorine species, and the byproduct selectivity was shifted away from NO to presumably chloramines and N-2. Overall, these results indicate that the electrochemical reactor configuration should be carefully considered depending on the desired outcome of treating source-separated urine (e.g., nitrogen recovery, H-2 generation).

TI One-pot Synthesis of NiO/NiCr2O4 Nanostructure as
   an Efficient Catalyst for Urea Electro-oxidation in Alkaline Media
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The development of exceptionally active and stable electrocatalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a current research topic of interest. In this work, NiO/NiCr2O4 nanocomposites with different CrNi ratios (denoted as NiO/NiCr2O4-m, m = 1, 2, 3) were synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal mothed without any template followed by a thermal treatment in N-2 at 600 degrees C. The NiO/NiCr2O4-2 catalyst exhibited a large electrochemical surface area, which provided numerous accessible active sites and electronic transmission channels for the UOR. At a low catalyst loading of 50 mu g cm(-2), NiO/NiCr2O4-2 electrode delivered a current density of 994 mA cm(-2) mg(-1) (49.7 mA cm(-2)) in an electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea at the potential of +0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl. The catalyst showed excellent redox characteristics and better stability compared to catalysts with other ratios of NiO/NiCr2O4, pure NiO and NiCr2O4 prepared similarly. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of NiO and NiCr2O4, multicomponent catalysts, particularly NiO/NiCr2O4-2, have demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activities and are considered as promising candidates for direct urea fuel cells.

TI Ni2Se3-CuSex Heterostructure as
   a Highly Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Urea-Assisted
   Hydrogen Generation
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Coupling urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an attractive alternative anode reaction for electrochemical hydrogen generation with low energy consumption. However, the development of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts is still a challenge. In this work, Ni2Se3-CuSex heterostructure was synthesized on copper foam (Ni3Se2@CuSex/CF) by electrodeposition accompanied by a selenization process. Benefiting from the abundant active sites, faster reaction kinetics, and modulated electronic structure, the self-supporting Ni3Se2@CuSex/CF electrode exhibited superior catalytic performance. Extremely low overpotentials of 120 and 140 mV were achieved at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for HER/UOR, respectively. Respectively, in HER||UOR coupled electrolyzer for H-2 generation, the Ni3Se2@CuSex/CF||Ni3Se2@CuSex/CF delivered a low cell voltage of 1.49 V to reach a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) along with good stability, outperforming most of the other well-developed materials to date. The rational design of coupled heterostructure as bifunctional electrodes is a promising approach for energy-saving H-2 production.

TI Coupling interface constructions of flower-like structure
   MoSe2-NiWSe2 for efficient oxygen evolution
   reaction and urea oxidation reaction
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Because of its low thermodynamic voltage, the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an effective way to replace the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and address the issue of urea-rich water pollution. Herein, we have synthesized MoSe2-NiWSe2 with spherical nanoflower structure consisting of MoSe2 nanosheets and NiWSe2 nanosheets crisscrossed longitudinally and transversely. The results show that the prepared MoSe2-NiWSe2 has a significant competitive advantage in the UOR and OER. With 10 mA cm(-2), a mere 200 mV overpotential was required, indicating high OER catalytic activity. MoSe2-NiWSe2-driven UOR might operate at a comparatively low potential of 1.36 V (10 mA cm(-2)). The overpotential did not significantly alter after 40 h of continuous operation, suggesting it possesses high UOR stability. A built-in electric field that aids in controlling the adsorption and oriented distribution of urea molecules and thus promotes the oxidative properties of water and urea forms at the interface of MoSe2 and NiWSe2, where the difference in electronegativity between the elements Mo and Ni induces self-driven charge transfer and interfacial coupling effects. This work offers a method for creating catalysts that produce more oxygen and clean up urea-rich water contamination.

TI Modulating the electronic structure of ultra-thin NiCo-LDH by
   FeNiCoS4 for efficient electrocatalytic urea oxidation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) provides a promising alternative pathway for oxygen evolution in water electrolysis due to its lower thermodynamic barriers. Developing efficient nonprecious metal UOR catalysts is important. Rational design of heterogeneous structures to regulate the morphology and electronic structure is an effective method to improve the activity of electrocatalysts. Herein, a unique heterostructure of ultrathin NiCo-LDH supported by FeNiCoS4 was constructed for the UOR via a facile hydrothermal followed by electrodeposition process. The electrode exhibits superior activity and stability in a solution of 1 M KOH containing 0.33 M urea, with a potential of 1.366 V at 50 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability over 48 h. The outstanding performance is attributed to the high conductivity of FeNiCoS4, ultrathin NiCo-LDH and the strong interface interaction between the two components, regulating the local electronic structure of the active metals. This work represents an effective strategy for the preparation of an efficient UOR catalyst with promising applications.

TI Insight into the High Activity of Nickel Phosphide Precatalysts for Urea
   Oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The quest for advanced Ni-based (pre)catalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been significantly impeded by a lack of understanding regarding the catalytic structures and mechanisms after the surface reconstruction, particularly for metalloid compounds like nickel phosphide. This study systematically investigates the UOR performance of Ni(OH)2, nickel phosphate (Ni-Pi), and Ni2P, shedding light on the role of electronic structure and surface morphology in dictating catalytic activity. Through the electrochemical experiments and in situ spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate that the superior activity of Ni2P originates from its unique electronic conductivity and the presence of residual phosphate ions, which facilitate the formation of highly active, coordinatively unsaturated sites following the surface reconstruction as well as the faster electron transport. A novel descriptor based on the reversibility of the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple is proposed to underscore the importance of NiOOH formation and regeneration kinetics in the UOR process. The findings reveal that the rapid UOR dynamics on Ni2P results in minimal accumulation of intermediates, indicative of its high catalytic efficiency. This research not only elucidates the catalytic mechanisms of metal-nonmetal compounds in UOR but also offers a strategic framework for the design of efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.

AB The highly porous electrode of a crisscrossed CoNi nanosheets array grown on reduced graphene oxide decorated Ni foam (CoNi/rGO@Ni foam) is fabricated through a facile dip and dry method followed by electroreduction and electrodeposition methods. The phase composition and morphology of the electrode are characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and EDS. In single electrode tests, CoNi/rGO@Ni foam electrode displays an excellent catalytic performance (330 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V) and stability towards urea electrooxidation when comparing to Ni foam and CoNi nanosheets modified Ni foam (CoNi@Ni foam) electrode. Besides, a low initial oxidation potential of urea electro-oxidation to 0.14 V is achieved on the CoNi/rGO@Ni foam electrode. The introducing of rGO to the electrode greatly reduced the reaction activation energy from 14.47 to 10.35 kJ mol(-1). Besides, large active surface area (261.67 cm(2)) is also obtained from the electrode. The CoNi/rGO@Ni foam anode exhibits a maximum power density of 12.58 mW cm(-2) in direct urea-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell tests. Excellent performance shows in single electrode tests and fuel cell tests suggest that addition of rGO to the electrode is an easy and feasible method to enhance the performance of the catalyst.

The first step was to destroy the cellulose crystal I by NaOH/urea solution to obtain cellulose powder with decreased crystallinity. The second step was to oxidize the cellulose powder by TEMPO oxidation. The TEMPO-oxidized cellulose was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), conductimetry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), fiber analyzer, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FTIR showed that the hydroxymethyl groups in cellulose chains were converted into carboxyl groups. The degree of oxidation measured by conductimetry titration was as high as 91.0%. The TEMPO-oxidized cellulose was soluble in water for valuable polyelectrolytes and intermediates.

TI Electrodeposited Ni-Fe alloy as a cost-effective material for harnessing
   hydrogen via the oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Electrochemical energy conversion for hydrogen production is a crucial method to address the global energy demand. Here, a cost-effective approach for the preparation of a transition metal-based alloy electrode through electrodeposition with composition-modulated binary alloy electrodes is achieved using various electrolyte concentrations. An alloy electrode formed from the synergistic combination of Ni-Fe acted as a dual-path energy conversion anode in two different energy conversion systems, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Under the optimal conditions, the Ni-5-Fe-3 alloy electrode consumes 1.48 V and 1.45 V vs. RHE for the OER and UOR, respectively. Evidential information from solar-powered water and urea oxidation with a low cell voltage (1.52 V) supports the feasibility of the prepared electrode materials. A lab scale direct oxidation of human urine has also been conducted and the obtained results are a promising cornerstone for waste-to-energy achievement.

TI Preparation of Nanocatalysts Using Deposition Precipitation with Urea:
   Mechanism, Advantages and Results
SO CHEMBIOENG REVIEWS
AB The main works carried out on precipitation deposition with urea (DPU) are summarized. This method is widely applied and considered as excellent for the preparation of catalysts. It proved to be the optimum technique, e.g., in view of deposition yield, total reduced particle size, high particle distribution, and metal-support interaction. The influence of several parameters on the DPU process, such as the effect of temperature during deposition, maturation time, annealing manner of the final powder, metal and the urea concentrations and others, are discussed. The main steps of the DPU, the preparation of monometallic catalysts by this variant, and the bimetallic catalysts obtained by co-deposition precipitation with urea (CO-DPU) are described.

TI Engineering hierarchical quaternary superstructure of an integrated
   MOF-derived electrode for boosting urea electrooxidation assisted water
   electrolysis
SO GREEN ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT
AB Controllable design of the catalytic electrodes with hierarchical superstructures is expected to improve their electrochemical performance. Herein, a self-supported integrated electrode (NiCo-ZLDH/NF) with a unique hierarchical quaternary superstructure was fabricated through a self-sacrificing template strategy from the metal-organic framework (Co-ZIF-67) nanoplate arrays, which features an intriguing well-defined hierarchy when taking the unit cells of the NiCo-based layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) as the primary structure, the ultrathin LDH nanoneedles as the secondary structure, the mesoscale hollow plates of the LDH nanoneedle arrays as the tertiary structure, and the macroscale three-dimensional frames of the plate arrays as the quaternary structure. Notably, the distinctive structure of NiCo-ZLDH/NF can not only accelerate both mass and charge transfer, but also expose plentiful accessible active sites with high intrinsic activity, endowing it with an excellent electrochemical performance for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specially, it only required the low potentials of 1.335, 1.368 and 1.388 V to deliver the current densities of 10, 100 and 200 mA cm-2, respectively, much superior to those for typical NiCo-LDH. Employing NiCo-ZLDH/NF as the bifunctional electrode for both anodic UOR and cathodic HER, an energy-saving electrolysis system was further explored which can greatly reduce the needed voltage of 213 mV to deliver the current density of 100 mA cm-2, as compared to the conventional water electrolysis system composed of OER. This work manifests that it is prospective to explore the hierarchically nanostructured electrodes and the innovative electrolytic technologies for high-efficiency electrocatalysis.

TI A paper microfluidic fuel cell powered by urea
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB A paper microfluidic fuel cell was developed that is powered by urea and compares favorably to recent literature reports of paper microfluidic fuel cells. During fuel cell testing, we found the maximum power density to be as high as 0.91 mW cm(-2) and the maximum current density to be as high as 4.3 mA cm(-2) at room temperature using 0.3 M urea as fuel. Under continuous reactant flow, the fuel cell voltage is stable for at least 1 h. Under stopped flow conditions, the voltage was stable for up to 20 min. When 3 fuel cells (using Ni anode) were connected in series, sufficient energy was produced to power the LCD screen of a paper-based, over-the-counter pregnancy test for at least 30 min. Since this fuel cell is constructed on paper, it does not require continuous flow of reactants as a micro-channeled microfluidic fuel cell would. Hence, it could be possible with this chemistry to integrate energy production with urinalysis on paper since human urine contains both urea (fuel) and hormones (analyte) to provide power and analyte simultaneously.

TI Plasmonic MoO2 coupled with sulfur-incorporated
   NiMoO4 as multifunctional heterostructures for solar
   thermoelectric self-powered urea electrolysis
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Efficient conversion and utilization of abundant renewable solar energy is highly desirable for the sustainable production of green hydrogen, but it is still a great challenge. In the present study, the multifunctional heterostructure of MoO2 coupled with sulfur-incorporated NiMoO4 (S-NiMo) on nickel foam (NF) was explored to construct a self-powered hydrogen production system that ingeniously integrates a solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) and a urea electrolyzer. The plasmonic MoO(2 )in S-NiMo/NF acts as a solar absorption unit to covert solar energy into thermal energy, which can combine with thermoelectric (TE) module for efficient power generation. When served as an electrocatalyst, the S-NiMo/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances to promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and overall urea electrolysis. Under simulated solar irradiation at light intensity of 5 sun, the S-NiMo/NF-based STEG-urea electrolyzer system can produce 2.68 mu mol of hydrogen per minute via the four-series connected S-NiMo/NF-STEGs. This self-powered thermoelectric urea electrolysis system offers new opportunities to convert renewable solar energy into green hydrogen.

TI Fabrication of an amperometric urea biosensor using urease and metal
   catalysts immobilized by a polyion complex
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB An amperometric urea biosensor based on urease and metal catalysts (Pt and Rh) has been synthesized on a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-modified ITO glass. A sequential coating of the metal catalysts and urease over the surface of the MWCNT-modified ITO glass was adopted for the electrode preparation by entrapment with a polyion complex (PIC). The activity of the immobilized enzyme for urea hydrolysis and the metal catalysts for the electrochemical oxidation of the ammonia generated during the enzymatic reaction were investigated. The electrochemical performance of the bioelectrode was characterized by a cyclic voltammetry technique. The sensor exhibited a linear amperometric response to urea concentration ranging from 0.05 mM to 20 mM, with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.995. A sensitivity of 1.7 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and a response time of approximately 10 s were achieved for the hybrid electrode. The biosensor retained half of its initial activity after 20 days of storage under ambient conditions. The urea sensor employing an enzyme and metal catalysts exhibited excellent electroactivity and sensor efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The carboxylic acid-functionalized graphene oxide/gold nanoparticles modified glassy carbon electrode has been utilized as a platform to immobilize 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (mesalazine). The su rface structure and composition of the sensor were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Electrocatalytic oxidation of urea on the surface of modified electrode was investigated with cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and hydrodynamic voltammetry methods. The cyclic voltammetric results indicated the ability of carboxylic acid-functionalized graphene oxide gold nanoparticles modified glassy carbon electrode to catalyze the oxidation of urea. In addition, the modified electrode has short response time, low detection limit, high sensitivity, and low operation potential. Some kinetic parameters, such as the electron transfer coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and catalytic rate constant of the catalytic reaction were calculated. A sensitive amperometric method was proposed for determination of urea with advantages of fast response and good reproducibility.

TI Oxygen vacancy-rich nitrogen-doped CO3O4
   nanosheets as an efficient water-resistant catalyst for low temperature
   CO oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Over the past decade, there has been significant research of CO3O4 catalysts for oxidation of carbon mono oxide (CO) at low temperatures. However, development of water-resistant CO3O4 materials is still challenging. In this work, a novel oxygen vacancy-rich nitrogen-doped Co3O4 catalyst was developed using straightforward urea-assisted method. Nitrogen doping increases oxygen vacancies on the surface in Co3O4 as well as improves the activity of lattice oxygen. Comparing with pure CO3O4 and CO3O4 with less nitrogen doping, the as-synthesized nitrogen-doped CO3O4 exhibited significantly enhanced activity as well as water resistance in the catalytic oxidation of CO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of CO oxidation on N-doped CO3O4, which provides a new strategy for developing highly active and water-resistant catalysts.

TI Construction of hierarchical nanostructures and NiO nanosheets@nanorods
   for efficient urea electrooxidation
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB Hierarchical NiO nanosheets@nanorods have been rationally designed and constructed for efficient urea electrooxidation in an alkaline solution. The critical synthetic strategy, engaging the one-step anion -competitive reaction, precisely integrates two nickel-based materials into a heterostructure with Ni(OH)2 nanosheets and NiC2O4 nanorods. Benefiting from the hierarchically porous structure and high specific surface area, the NiO NNs can improve the escape efficiency of gas in electrochemical reactions and main-tain sustainability. Furthermore, this distinctive structure can expose highly dispersed active sites for en-hancing urea molecules' adsorption, surface-dependent redox reactions, and electrical conductivities. As a result, these hierarchical NiO nanosheets@nanorods exhibit superior activity with a low overpotential of 156 mV at 10 mA/cm2, and a slight Tafel slope of 40.7 mV/dec, and high stability with almost no decay of 12,0 0 0 s for urea electrooxidation. This work promotes the application of well-designed hierarchical structure in electrooxidizing urea and provides a possibility for highly efficient electrolysis of alkaline urea wastewater.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

TI Hindered Urea Bond: A Bilaterally Responsive Chemistry to Hydrogen
   Peroxide
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB As a type of safe, clean, and bio-relevant oxidant, hydrogen peroxide has been widely used as a trigger in the design of stimuli-responsive materials. Hindered urea bond (HUB) is a type of dynamic covalent bond which can reversibly dissociate into isocyanate and amine. Quenching of isocyanate or amine will shift the equilibrium and facilitate the degradation of HUB bond. Herein, we report that one of the HUB moiety - 1,1-tert-butylethylurea (TBEU) can react with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) resulting in two opposing outcomes. Perhydrolysis of isocyanate and oxidation of amine lead to the bond fracture, while formation of urethane product with an oxygen inserted into the original TBEU structure was also observed giving a stabilized form of linkage. More precise kinetic control of the two distinct pathways are expected to make hydrogen peroxide a trigger to either degrade or fix the HUB based polymeric materials.

TI Unfolding the Significance of Regenerative Active Species in Nickel
   Hydroxide-Based Systems for Sustained Urea Electro-Oxidation
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Electrochemical urea oxidation (UOR) has gained attention as an alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of its low thermodynamic energy barrier for hydrogen generation. The activity enhancement of the conventional Ni-based catalysts can be addressed by enhancing NiOOH active species, but ensuring stability for a prolonged duration can be a challenging feat. The catalyst degradation is usually attributed to the lack of tolerance for COx released during UOR; however, in this study, we show that the catalyst activity and durability are also governed by the dynamics of the generated NiOOH species in Ni-hydroxides. We have studied the UOR activity and stability of Ni-based hydroxide systems, Ni(OH)(2) and Ni3O2(OH)(4), having Ni in different oxidation states. Ni3O2(OH)(4) shows better UOR activity in 0.1 M KOH as compared to Ni(OH)(2), but the activity trend is reversed in 1 M KOH. The time-dependent UOR indicates drastic degradation of activity for Ni3O2(OH)(4) in both electrolytes compared to Ni(OH)(2). The in situ X-ray absorption study reveals the regeneration of NiOOH active species in Ni(OH)(2) during the urea electrooxidation, whereas in Ni3O2(OH)(4), the active species gets reduced to Ni(OH)(2) rather than getting regenerated. The Ni3O2(OH)(4) catalyst seems to undergo fast degradation accompanied by an enhancement in the Ni-O and Ni-Ni coordination number as a function of KOH concentration derived from extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. The active species dynamics are further supported through in situ FT-infrared spectral studies. The variation in the contributions of direct and indirect mechanisms to UOR and their correlation with the regeneration of active species are analyzed through an electrochemical impedance study. The present study reveals that the regenerative active species of UOR catalysts have a profound effect on catalyst durability.

TI Urea removal coupled with enhanced electricity generation in
   single-chambered microbial fuel cells
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB High concentration of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in the form of urea is known to inhibit the performance of many biological wastewater treatment processes. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have great potential for TAN removal due to its unique oxic/anoxic environment. In this study, we demonstrated that increased urea (TAN) concentration up to 3940 mg/L did not inhibit power output of single-chambered MFCs, but enhanced power generation by 67% and improved coulombic efficiency by 78% compared to those obtained at 80 mg/L of TAN. Over 80% of nitrogen removal was achieved at TAN concentration of 2630 mg/L. The increased nitrogen removal coupled with significantly enhanced coulombic efficiency, which was observed for the first time, indicates the possibility of a new electricity generation mechanism in MFCs: direct oxidation of ammonia for power generation. This study also demonstrates the great potential of using one MFC reactor to achieve simultaneous electricity generation and urea removal from wastewater.

TI Porous hetero-structured nickel oxide/nickel phosphide nanosheets as
   bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen production via urea
   electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Urea electrolysis is a promising hydrogen generation and urea-rich wastewaters treatment technology, which requires the development of highly active electrocatalysts. In this study, porous heterostructured nanosheet electrocatalyst (NiO/Ni2P/NF), composed of crystalline NiO and Ni2P, is prepared via the in-situ acid etching and gas-phase phosphating method, and the obtained NiO/Ni2P/NF material is applied as efficient urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution catalyst for the overall splitting of ureacontaining wastewaters. An electrolyzer containing NiO/Ni2P/NF||NiO/Ni2P/NF electrode pair in an alkaline urea aqueous solution requires a potential of just 1.457 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2, lower than that of 1.490 V needed for a Pt/C/NF||RuO2/NF electrolyzer to operate under the same current density. The study demonstrates the synergistic effect between NiO/Ni2P nanosheets as well as their uniform pore structure formed by the Kirkendall effect, resulting in enhanced electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen production by urea electrolysis.

TI Solvent modulated self-assembled VS2 layered microstructure
   for electrocatalytic water and urea decomposition
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) assisted water-splitting is a promising approach for effective treatment of urea-rich waste-water at the anode and parallelly generate green-hydrogen (H-2) energy at the cathode via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, facile designing and fabricating robust and cheap electrodes derived from earth-abundant materials is a great challenge. This work reports the synthesis of vanadium sulfide (VS2) micro-flowered structure via solvent-assisted hydrothermal method using ethylene glycol as an additive in the aqueous-based reaction medium, which has imparted a significant effect on the morphology and the crystallinity of the VS2. In addition, in contrast to the VS2 electrode fabricated in a pure aqueous medium, the ethylene glycol mediated VS2 electrode upon coupling as a cathode and anode in an HER||UOR vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)-based three-electrode configuration demonstrates a significantly reduced overall urea decomposition potential of 1.38 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as compared to the conventional water-splitting of 1.75 V vs RHE. The obtained high-performance electrocatalytic activity on UOR and HER can be ascribed to the influence of ethylene glycol solvent, particularly on VS2 growth, morphology, and crystallinity, favoring the formation of abundant catalytic sites with facile electrolyte diffusion and electrolysis.

TI Ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets decorated on NiSe nanowire arrays as advanced
   trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and urea
   electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY
AB Developing highly-efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts act as pressing impacts on the flourishing of hydrogen energy, including electrochemical water splitting is a kind of prevailing energy conversion technology. However, it is hampered by the high activation barrier of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a hybrid electrocatalyst with trifunctional and 3D core-shell structure is designed by hydrother-mal process in order to achieve outstanding OER, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) properties. NiSe@MoS2/NF catalyst is composed of the heterogeneous interface formed by NiSe nanowire arrays which supported by nickel foam and MoS2 nanosheets. The synergistic effect and strong electronic interaction between the interface display the dominant impact of OER, HER and UOR. Especially in basic electrolyte, the potential is as low as 310 mV at 100 mA cm-2, even Tafel slope is 70.8 mV dec-1, representing the predominant OER property. The HER and UOR also demonstrate enor-mous prospect with 210, 233 mV at 100 mA cm-2. When NiSe@MoS2/NF||NiSe@MoS2/NF catalyst as anode and cathode, only requires potential of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm-2 for overall water splitting test. The work offers a plain, high-efficiency and inexpensive method to evolve the progressive trifunctional electrocatalysts for other energy-related applications.(c) 2023 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

TI Modulation of energy barrier of reaction steps over S-doped Ni(OH) 2 /Cu
   composites to achieve high-performance urea electrolysis catalysts
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Ni(OH) 2 has been found a cost-effective and promising electrocatalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). However, HER activity is challenging due to its weak adsorption of active H atoms, poor water dissociation, and low conductivity. In this study, heteroatomic S -doped Ni(OH) 2 /Cu composite has been synthesized using the onepot electrodeposition process. The incorporation of S atoms significantly enhanced the electron transfer rate and adsorption of active H atoms, which promoted the UOR and HER process. Similarly, the metallic Cu with S -doped Ni(OH) 2 also exhibited the synergistic effect and promoted water dissociation, adsorption of active H atoms. As expected, S -doped Ni(OH) 2 /Cu composites exhibit remarkable urea electrolysis activity with a small cell voltage of 1.35 V to approach the current density of 10 mA cm -2 . Results indicate that the adopted strategy has been found effective and the prepared composite is a good bifunctional urea electrolysis catalyst.

TI Self-supporting Nickel Phosphide/Hydroxides Hybrid Nanosheet Array as
   Superior Bifunctional Electrode for Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Production
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an important strategy to synergistically realize energy-saving hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea-rich wastewater purification by replacing water oxidation in water electrolysis. However, the efficient realization of integral urea electrolysis remains challenging. Herein, a self-supporting Ni2P-Ni(OH)(2) hybrid nanosheet array on nickel foam (Ni2P@Ni(OH)(2)/NF) is designed by a simple hydrothermal accompanied by electrodeposition strategy, representing a new class of bifunctional electrodes for urea-assisted water electrolysis. The Ni2P@Ni(OH)(2)/NF reaches the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at potentials of -0.16 V and 1.388 V, along with small Tafel slopes of 69 mV dec(-1) and 33 mV dec(-1) for HER/UOR, respectively. For the HER||UOR coupled system, the constructed electrolyzer only needs 1.38 V to realize the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) under 80 degrees C. The superior bifunctional activity of the Ni2P@Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrode is ascribed to the combined merits of the Ni2P@Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure, enriching the catalytic active sites and offering a faster charge transfer process for electrolysis. Our work provides important insights into the design of highly active bifunctional catalysts from the perspective of overall water electrolysis.

TI Incorporation of sulfur vacancies in the ZnIn2S4
   photoanode for highly efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting and
   urea oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Sluggish water oxidation kinetics and rapid charge recombination severely hinder the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance of the ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) photoanode. Herein, a simple annealing strategy to rationally modulate sulfur vacancies (Sv) in the ZIS photoanode is developed, and the optimized ZIS-Sv-2h photoelectrode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent density of 2.18 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), AM 1.5 G), achieving a low onset potential of 0.14 VRHE. Systematic electrochemical studies and dynamics analysis reveal that the sulfur vacancies (Sv) not only enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics but also improve the charge separation. More importantly, compared with the former, the latter plays a vital role in achieving enhanced PEC water oxidation performance. In addition, the ZIS-Sv-2h also presents high PEC activity for urea oxidation (4.60 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE). This work provides guidance for designing highly efficient photoelectrodes for solar-to-hydrogen conversion.

TI Comparative assessment of urea briquette applicators on greenhouse gas
   emission, nitrogen loss and soil enzymatic activities in tropical
   lowland rice
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Suitable method of application of urea briquette in flooded rice (Oryza sativa L.) not only increases nitrogen use efficiency, but at the same time sustain yield and reduce greenhouse gas emission in general and nitrous oxide emission in particular. Keeping this hypothesis, seven different treatments including manual and mechanical mode of application with two different type of applicators were tested in field in consecutive wet (2015) and dry (2016) seasons. Three row briquette applicator (TRBA) and top dressing applicator (TDA) were used in combination for basal and top dressing application along with prilled urea broadcasting and without application as well. It was observed the use of TRBA at basal with first top dressing by TDA and manual placement of urea briquette at second top dressing (TRBA + TDA) yielded highest @ 6.71 t ha(-1) and 5.47 t ha(-1) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, with the highest agronomic use efficiency (36.3 kg kg(-1)). Average emission of methane from all treatments were higher (19.2-27.1%) during wet season than the dry season and vice versa in case of nitrous oxide (3.6-11.8%). Among the treated plots, TRBA + TDA recorded the lowest emission of nitrous oxide. The largest amount of ammonia was lost through volatilization after basal application of urea, followed by top dressing at the end of maximum tillering stage and panicle initiation stage. As a whole, volatilization loss of N was lowest in control (3.3-3.4 mg NH3-N m(-2) d(-1)), followed by mechanical (27.6-33.9 mg NH3-N m(-2) d(-1)) and manual (49.1-55.3 mg NH3-N m(-2) d(-1)) method of urea briquette application. The population of nitrite oxidizers and heterotrophs were highest in prilled urea broadcasting. Soil dehydrogenase activity was the highest in urea briquette manual placement + top dressing applicator (UBMP + TDA, 148.0 pg-160.0 TPF g(-1) soil d(-1)) treatment, while the urease activity was less was in urea applicator treated plots. Subsurface application of larger size urea (urea briquette) and applicator based precise placement of urea reduced the lossess of nitrogen through ammonia volatilization and nitrous oxide emission, thus enhanced nitrogen use efficiency. Apart from that, issue of adequate skilled labour for precise depth of application could be tackled by effectively adopting mechanical placement of urea briquette. The mechanical placement of briquette (relatively larger size particle) in tropical flooded rice is more precise and less labour intensive, hence this is an efficient environment friendly approach of N management.

TI Enhanced oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reaction using a
   nanosheet-structured NiO@P-doped carbon composite as an anode catalyst
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB One promising approach to solving energy and environmental problems is urea electrolysis. In order to catalyze the urea oxidation process (UOR), we were able to successfully construct a NiO hierarchical nanosheet on a P-doped carbon layer (NiO@PC). Because of the increased electrical conductivity and the widespread practice of using the direct electro-oxidation mechanism to initiate the UOR, NiO@PC is a good substitute for valuable metals like IrO2 because it has UOR activity that is on par with the most active modern catalysts. The outermost layer of P-doped carbon enhanced Ni-O bond fabrication at the anion-cation interface; because of this, the NiO@PC hierarchical nanosheet initiates the UOR process with a lower onset-potential (1.30 V vs. RHE) than the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet. The NiO@PC nanosheet acts as a reaction site during the UOR process for the generated NiOOH rather than the NiO phase, although both the NiOOH and the NiO phase operate as active sites during the OER process. This study contributes to our comprehension of the UOR mechanism and creates a new path for the development of affordable P-doped carbon UOR catalysts based on Ni.

SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Developing multifunctional, efficient, inexpensive, and eco-friendly electrocatalyst has become a challenging and crucial task for researchers. Herein, we have designed and developed a NiCo-based NiCo-MOF-Phosphide (NiCo-MOF-P) as a multifunctional electrocatalyst via electrodeposition and phosphorization approach. The structurally and electronically modified NiCo-MOF-P can significantly boost the electrocatalytic activity towards urea-assisted water splitting. The optimized electrocatalyst exhibits a lower overpotential of 230 mV for OER and delivered a current density 10 mA cm-2 at applied potential of 1.33 V for UOR. When, catalyst was used as cathode and anode, it requires a cell voltage of 1.45 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2 for urea-assisted full water splitting (230 mV less than that of urea free counterpart) with remarkable long time stability. The NiCo-MOF-P also exhibits an overpotential 191 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for HER in an alkaline medium.

TI A novel Ni-Cu/ZnO@MWCNT anode employed in urea fuel cell to attain
   superior performances
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Ni-Cu alloy nanoparticles loaded onto ZnO- coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were evaluated as anode catalysts in direct urea fuel cells. The Ni-Cu/ZnO@MWCNT catalyst was synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal process. Uniform distribution of the spherical Ni-Cu alloy nanoparticles on the ZnO@MWCNT surface was realized, as ascertained by scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. A Ni-Cu/MWCNT catalyst was also prepared and evaluated to examine the effect of the ZnO coating on the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Cu/ZnO@MWCNT. Cyclic voltammetry of the Ni-Cu/ZnO@MWCNT catalyst exhibited a peak current density of 30.02 mA cm(-2) at 0.38 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a low onset potential in an aqueous solution of 0.4 M KOH/0.07M urea. The Ni-Cu/ZnO@MWCNT catalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity for urea electro-oxidation than Ni-Cu/MWCNT, owing to the electronic interaction between its different components, viz, Ni, Cu, and ZnO@MWCNT. A unit cell based on the Ni-Cu/ZnO@MWCNT anode exhibited peak power densities of 26.9 and 44.36 mW cm(-2) at 20 and 50 degrees C, respectively, in 3 M KOH/0.70M urea fuel. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI In Situ Construction of Nickel Sulfide Nano-Heterostructures for Highly
   Efficient Overall Urea Electrolysis
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Constructing high-performance bifunctional catalysts for urea oxidation (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is beneficial to improving the hydrogen production efficiency and reducing the cost of electrolyzers. Currently, nickel sulfides are of wide concern due to their theoretically high catalytic activity and the characteristic that their activity is very sensitive to the phase structure. Integrating the respective advantages of different phases to form heterojunctions can effectively enhance the bifunctionality of nickel sulfides; however, their performance is still far lower than that of an electrolyzer assembled with noble-metal catalysts. Herein, with NiMoO4 as the parent material, rod-like Ni3S2/NiS heterojunctions were controllably prepared on nickel foam (NF) via sulfurization and Mo leaching. Thanks to the abundant Ni2+ active sites in NiS, the metallic conductivity of Ni3S2, and the favorable three-dimensional mass transfer channels, the Ni3S2-NiS/NF exhibits an excellent bifunctionality with 1.273 V for UOR and -0.146 V for HER at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the urea electrolyzer with Ni3S2-NiS/NF as both the anode and cathode only requires 1.54 V to drive 50 mA cm(-2), outperforming the most advanced urea electrolyzers. This work provides a useful strategy for synthesizing efficient bifunctional or multifunctional catalysts by combining the advantages of different phases of the same composition material to design nano-heterostructures.

AB Exploiting efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts are significant for energy-saving H-2 production through urea-assisted water electrolysis, but it is still challenging. Herein, carbon-encapsulated CoNi coupled with CoNiMoO (CoNi@CN-CoNiMoO) is prepared by solvothermal method and calcination to enhance the activity/stability of urea-assisted water electrolysis at large current density. It exhibits good activity for UOR (E-10/1,E-000 = 1.29/1.40 V) and HER (E-10/-1000 = -45/-245 mV) in 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M urea solution. For the UOR||HER system, CoNi@CN-CoNiMoO only needs 1.58 V at 500 mA cm(-2) and shows good stability. Density functional theory calculation suggests that the strong electronic interaction at the interface between NiCo alloy and N-doping-carbon layers can optimize the adsorption/desorption energy of UOR/HER intermediates and accelerate the water dissociation, which can expedite urea decomposition and Volmer step, thus increasing the UOR and HER activity, respectively. This work provides a new solution to design UOR/HER catalysts for H-2 production through urea-assisted water electrolysis.

TI Effective NiMn Nanoparticles-Functionalized Carbon Felt as an Effective
   Anode for Direct Urea Fuel Cells
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The internal resistances of fuel cells strongly affect the generated power. Basically, in the fuel cell, the anode can be prepared by deposition of a film from the functional electrocatalyst on a proper gas diffusion layer. Accordingly, an interfacial resistance for the electron transport is created between the two layers. Electrocatalyst-functionalized gas diffusion layer (GDL) can distinctly reduce the interfacial resistance between the catalyst layer and the GDL. In this study, NiMn nanoparticles-decorated carbon felt is introduced as functionalized GDL to be exploited as a ready-made anode in a direct urea fuel cell. The proposed treated GDL was prepared by calcination of nickel acetate/manganese acetate-loaded carbon felt under an argon atmosphere at 850 degrees C. The physiochemical characterizations confirmed complete reduction for the utilized precursors and deposition of pristine NiMn nanoparticles on the carbon felt fiber. In passive direct urea fuel cells, investigation the performance of the functionalized GDLs indicated that the composition of the metal nanoparticles has to be optimized as the GDL obtained from 40 wt% manganese acetate reveals the maximum generated power density; 36 mW/m(2) at room temperature and 0.5 M urea solution. Moreover, the electrochemical measurements proved that low urea solution concentration is preferred as utilizing 0.5 M solution resulted into generating higher power compared to 1.0 and 2.0 M solution. Overall, this study opens a new avenue toward functionalization of the GDL as a novel strategy to overcome the interfacial resistance between the electrocatalyst and the GDL.

TI Effect of functional groups on the adsorption of urea on activated
   carbon
SO CARBON
AB The recovery of urea, present in the urine of mammals, has the potential of converting a current wastewater pollutant into an energy source due to its high hydrogen content, in alignment with the waste-to-energy principles. Carbon-based materials enable this approach due to their relatively high urea adsorption capacities. This work reveals that the adsorption of urea from aqueous solutions on activated carbon is a combination of weak van der Waals interactions such hydrogen bonds with the aromatic structure of the pristine carbon surface and also with carboxyl groups on the functionalised carbon, showing no appreciable interaction with hydroxyl or lactone groups. The selective introduction and quantification of different oxygen functional groups on activated carbon reveals their independent effect on the urea adsorption capacity, bringing an end to previous discrepancies in the literature. It also demonstrates that the optimisation of carbon materials must balance the increase of carboxyl groups and the decrease of the surface area associated to functionalisation treatments, providing guidance for future developments of carbon-based materials for circular economy applications.

TI BiFeO3-BiOI impregnation to UiO-66(Zr/Ti) as a promising
   candidate visible-light-driven photocatalyst for boosting urea
   photodecomposition in a continuous flow-loop thin-film slurry flat-plate
   photoreactor
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB The BiOI/BiFeO3/UiO-66(Zr/Ti)-MOF composite as a new ternary separable visible light photocatalyst was synthesized and well-characterized through the XRD, FE-SEM, FTIR, PL, VSM and DRS analyses. The BiOI/BiFeO3/UiO-66 photocatalytic performance for urea photo-oxidation to N-2, H2O and CO2 were evaluated in a continuous flow-loop thin-film slurry flat-plate photoreactor (TFSR) equipped to blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) illumination. Results show that the introduction of BiFeO3 perovskite and BiOI on the UiO-66(Zr/Ti) surface improves the separation and migration rate of photo-induced charges and thereby boosting the photocatalytic efficiency. Additionally, the appropriate band alignment, photo-stability and electron-hole pairs separation improvement of BiOI/BiFeO3/UiO-66(Zr/Ti)-MOF cause to enhance the urea decomposition. Moreover, five operational parameters including solution flow rate, pH, initial urea concentration, photocatalyst mass and light irradiation time were analyzed and optimized using the central composite design (CCD) and desirability function (DF), respectively. The maximum urea photocatalytic oxidation and elimination efficiency (88.53%) with the desirability value of 0.84 was achieved at the optimum conditions: 603 ml/min, 0.12 g/L, 7, 136 min and 60 ppm for flow rate, photocatalyst mass, pH, irradiation time and initial urea concentration, respectively.

TI Effect of oxygen and additives on thermal decomposition of aqueous urea
   solution
SO FUEL
AB The thermal decomposition of aqueous urea solution was studied in a lab-scale experimental system. The experimental research was focused on the effect of oxygen concentration and different additives on NH3 yields, N2O production, and CO concentration. Without oxygen or additives, the NH3 yields increased gradually as the temperature increased from 473 K to 923 K and remained approximately 60% in the temperature range of 923-1073 K. Oxygen promoted the thermal decomposition process and enhanced the NH3 yields in the temperature range of 473-773 K, but it brought about the oxidation of NH3 and led to significant decline of the NH3 yields when the reaction temperature was above 823 K. The addition of Na2CO3 promoted the NH3 yields obviously, but it did not restrain the NH3 oxidation at high temperatures. Furthermore, Na2CO3 reduced the production of N2O and CO at 623-1073 K. Similar to Na2CO3, the addition of NaNO3 also increased the NH3 yields and decreased the N2O and CO concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI NiSe2/CeO2 catalysts from Ce-UiO-66 metal-organic
   skeletons and their electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol, urea and
   glycerol
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Hydrogen is a viable alternative energy source to fossil fuels. In order to manufacture enough hydrogen to meet the needs of social growth, finding an alternate energy source that is more effective is essential. Electrochemical water cracking is a more appropriate method for producing hydrogen. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) can be used to replace the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and indirectly accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which has the advantages of saving energy and reducing environmental pollution. In this study, Ni/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by thermal annealing of MOFs (Ce-UiO-66) containing nickel species and NiSe2/CeO2 nanocrystalline catalysts were obtained through the selenation reaction at different temperatures. The NiSe2/CeO2-450 degree celsius catalysts exhibited superior catalytic performance for the MOR, UOR, and GOR. The MOR showed a peak current density of roughly 186.68 mA cm(-2) and a low oxidation potential of around 1.34 V. Similarly, the UOR demonstrated a peak current density of approximately 142.28 mA cm(-2) and a low oxidation potential of around 1.32 V. Furthermore, the GOR exhibited a peak current density of approximately 82.56 mA cm(-2) and a low oxidation potential of around 1.37 V. NiSe2/CeO2-450 degree celsius could improve electrocatalytic performance for the MOR, UOR, and GOR, which is attributed to the more active sites that were exposed as a result of utilizing MOFs (Ce-UiO-66) as a precursor. Additionally, selenation increased the ability to transfer electrons. This research is crucial for the production of inexpensive, easily accessible transition metals in place of expensive noble metals, for the reduction of wastewater pollution from methanol and urea, and for the creation of effective anodic oxidation electrocatalysts.

   Electrocatalysts Decorated with NiFeO x H
   y  for Energy-Saving Hydrogen Evolution via Urea
   Oxidation Reaction-Assisted Water Splitting
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Clean hydrogen extracted from water splitting is a sustainable energy source, but it remains challenging because it requires a low-cost and high-efficient electrocatalyst. Herein, a two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is applied to fabricate a dual-functional electrocatalyst consisting of Mo (oxy)sulfide alongside Ni3S2, from a single-source precursor, self-supported on Ni foam (NF), providing effective control on competitive sulfurization of Ni and Mo. The MoS2-MoO2/Ni3S2/NF allows not only the suitable exposure of highly active heterointerfaces but also the facilitated charge transport along both the metallic Ni3S2 and MoO2 anchored on the conducting Ni foam, resulting in kinetics and activity improvement for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions. In the next step, benefitting from a simple immersing method, a NiFeOxHy nanolayer decorates the surface of the prepared MoS2-MoO2/Ni3S2/NF. The NiFeOxHy/MoS2-MoO2/Ni3S2/NF exhibits low overpotentials of 220 and 147 mV (@+/- 10 mA/cm(2)) and small Tafel slope values of 33 and 89 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH for OER and HER, respectively. Replacing the OER with a urea oxidation reaction (UOR) leads to energy-efficient hydrogen generation. Assembling a two-electrode electrolyzer, the designed electrocatalyst achieves a low cell voltage of 1.47 V @10 mA/cm(2) for the UOR.

TI Sensitive determination of urea in luciferin chemiluminescence system
   using an experimental design
SO CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB In this study, a sensitive and rapid chemiluminescence (CL) approach was developed to determine the lowest concentration of urea in the luminescent system of bioluminescent earthworms based on the urea reaction with luciferin, a common substrate for bioluminescent earthworms. To this end, response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized through a Box-Behnken design (BBD) to optimize the key variables such as luciferin (2 x 10(-4)-2 x 10(-2) M), urea (1 x 10(-5)-1 x 10(-3) M), and the mixture of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as oxidant (2 x 10(-4)-2 x 10(-2) M) and also evaluate their interactive effects on the CL emission. The linear response of CL intensity was detected in the urea concentration ranging from 1 x 10(-2) to 5 x 10(-9) M (R-2 = 0.9918). The detection limit under the optimum conditions was calculated 3.25 x 10(-10) M. This rapid and facile method required low amounts of reagent for the successful detection of urea. Based on the results, these methods can offer an opportunity for the potential role of the bioluminescent earthworms in biological and non-biological analyses.

TI Exploring The Synergistic Effect Of CoSeP/CoP Interface Catalyst For
   Efficient Urea Electrolysis
SO SMALL
AB Electrocatalytic oxidation of urea (UOR) is a potential energy-saving hydrogen production technology that can replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, CoSeP/CoP interface catalyst is synthesized on nickel foam using hydrothermal, solvothermal, and in situ template methods. The strong interaction of tailored CoSeP/CoP interface promotes the hydrogen production performance of electrolytic urea. During the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the overpotential can reach 33.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The cell voltage can reach 1.36 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in the overall urea electrolytic process. Notably, the overall urine electrolysis performance of the catalyst in the human urine medium can reach 1.40 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and can exhibit durable cycle stability at 100 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) proves that the CoSeP/CoP interface catalyst can better adsorb and stabilize reaction intermediates CO* and NH* on its surface through a strong synergistic effect, thus enhancing the catalytic activity.

SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Urea is the final product of nitrogen metabolism in mammals. In human beings, it is a main indicator of liver and kidney activity and a marker for hemodialysis treatments. Furthermore, urea is used in many industrial processes, in agriculture and in the farm industries. Thus, it is important to evaluate the level of this compound in biological fluids, in environmental matrices and in food samples. Electrochemical sensors represent an interesting tool for simple, rapid, in-situ, in-flow monitoring of urea. This review focuses on the recent advancements in electrochemical sensors and biosensors for urea determination. An overview of the existing electroanalytical approaches for urea determination is presented, and some new strategies are discussed, particularly those based on nanostructuration of the electrode surface. Finally, a brief description of the role that Artificial Intelligence could have in overcoming selectivity issues and speed of the analysis is also discussed.

SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this study, Ni-MOF-derived NiO was mixed with various weights of commercial antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) using a simple and efficient hydrothermal method to synthesize composites denoted as AN-1, AN-2, and AN-3, which were subsequently characterized using a variety of physicochemical methods. The as-prepared materials were used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In the UOR, the AN-1 electrocatalyst exhibited excellent performance compared to the other electrocatalysts. In a 1.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, the OER onset potential was approximately 1.64 V, whereas, in the UOR, the overpotential was 1.38 V (vs RHE), which is lower than that of the OER. The AN-1 electrocatalyst showed lower Tafel slope values in both the OER and UOR studies: 173 mV dec- 1 and 109mV dec-1, respectively.

AB There are many factors that affect the efficiency of NOx conversion in the diesel engine SCR (selective catalytic reduction) post-processing system. In this study, we researched the factors affecting the efficiency of NOx conversion by engine bench testing. The SCR system was applied to the Weichai WD615 engine exhaust. First, the system used DOC (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst)/DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) of which DOC is a noble metal-containing filter, it lets the filter passes through converting nitrogen monoxide (NO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for passive regenerations and to provide high hydrocarbon (HC) oxidation activity for active DPF regenerations, the DPF is a wall-flow filter used to trap the remaining soot that the DOC can not oxidize. The combined catalytic oxidation device improved the original SCR deNO(x) system, which we developed. The new catalytic oxidation apparatus has a simple structure and fundamentally solves the clogging problem of the SCR method and the defects led by the unstable gaseous ammonia generation. Secondly, we studied the influence of an increased urea injection on the conversion efficiency of NOx and the secondary pollution of NH3 at different speeds and torques of the engine. It was found that at the maximum removal rate, the downstream NOx concentration was only 1 ppm. The NOx conversion efficiency can reach 79.10% or more-even 99.90%. Finally, we used the KDS and the BOSCH urea injection pumps to analyze the effect of different pumps on the conversion efficiency of NOx. Hence, the matching diesel engine urea SCR post-processing system can reduce the emission concentration and pollution. There was little difference between the two pumps under most of the working conditions, although KDS was a little better than BOSCH under some individual conditions.

SO PHOSPHORUS SULFUR AND SILICON AND THE RELATED ELEMENTS
AB Novel organic-inorganic hybrid heterogeneous catalysts containing cobalt(II) and iron(III) Schiff base complexes, grafted on the internal surface of MCM-41 pores were prepared by introducing a metal salt into a mesoporous silica functionalized with a Schiff base ligand. The chemical and physical properties of the catalysts were investigated by BET, TGA, XRD, FT-IR, and TEM techniques. These complexes were found to be efficient, selective catalysts for the oxidation of various sulfides to sulfoxides and oxidative coupling of thiols to their corresponding disulfides with urea hydrogen peroxide in excellent yield at room temperature. The designed catalytic system prevents effectively the overoxidation of sulfides and thiols to sulfoxides and sulfones, respectively. Also the heterogeneous catalysts can be recovered easily and reused many times without significant loss of activity and selectivity.

TI Synthesis, properties, and applications of hybrid polyurethane urea
   obtained from air-oxidized soybean oil
SO PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS
AB This study explores the synthesis of hybrid polyurethane (PU) urea obtained from air-oxidized soybean oil. The effect of the oxidation time of the soybean oil on the production of soy poliol and hybrid PU urea films employing (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane was investigated. Soybean polyols and hybrid PU urea materials were characterized by various techniques such as H-1 and Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), gel content, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), contact angle, and glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the physicomechanical properties of the materials were characterized and their corrosion resistance was determined. The produced ecofriendly materials exhibited a dependency of the hybrid network on the degree of gel content. The phase morphology developed during the polymerization reaction influences the size of hard domains and their organization. This study provides a direct relation between the corrosion resistance and material hydrophobicity and the nature of the heterogeneity of the phase morphology formed during one-step polymerization procedure.

TI Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Fe/Co-based Bifunctional Electrode for
   H2 Production through Water and Urea Electrolysis
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Hollow-structured FexCo2-xP, FexCo3-xO4, and Prussian blue analogue (FeCo-PBA) microbuilding arrays on Ni foam (NF) are derived from Co-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOF) using a simple room temperature and post-heat-treatment route. Among them, FexCo2-xP/NF shows excellent bifunctional catalytic activities by demonstrating very low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials of 255/114mV at a current density of 20/10mAcm(-2) respectively, whereas FexCo3-xO4/NF and FeCo-PBA/NF demand higher overpotentials. Remarkably, for water electrolysis, FexCo2-xP/NF requires only 1.61V to obtain 10mAcm(-2). In contrast to water electrolysis, urea electrolysis reduces overpotential and simultaneously purifies the urea-rich wastewater. The urea oxidation reaction at the FexCo2-xP/NF anode needs just 1.345V to achieve 20mAcm(-2), which is 140mV less than the 1.48V potential required for OER. Moreover, the generation of H-2 through urea electrolysis needs only 1.42V to drive 10mAcm(-2).

TI Ni5Sm-P/C ternary alloyed catalyst as highly efficient
   electrocatalyst for urea electrooxidation
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB A ternary Ni5Sm-P/C electrocatalyst is successfully prepared for urea electrooxidation. Physical characterization reveals that the addition of samarium (Sm) and phosphorus (P) to nickel (Ni) can change the electronic configurations of the Ni5Sm-P/C catalyst, leading to more active form of NiOOH. Electrochemical measurements show that the Ni5Sm-P/C catalyst exhibits exceptionally high activity and good stability for the electrooxidation of urea. Notably, the anodic peak current of Ni5Sm-P/C catalyst is over 1.5 times, 21 times and 29 times higher than that of Ni-P/C, NisSm/C and Ni/C, respectively. The high activity on Ni5Sm-P/C owes to the synergistic contribution among Ni, Sm and P. All results demonstrate that adding metal and non-metallic components into Ni/C catalyst will provide a valuable resource of research and practical application for improving the performance of direct urea fuel cells.

TI A multi-component system for urea electrooxidation: Ir3Sn
   nanoparticles loading on Iron- and Nitrogen- codoped composite carbon
   support
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Multi component system is a good strategy in attaining highly efficient electrocatalyst. In this study, through combining two aspects of multi-component alloy and composite support, a multi-component system of Ir(3)5n/FeNC electrocatalyst is obtained for urea electrooxidation reaction. With a series of the characterizations, the heterogeneous structure of Ir(3)5n/FeNC electrocatalyst, which consists of multi-component Ir3Sn alloy nanoparticles and composite FeNC support, is identified. The electrochemical results show that the Ir(3)5n/FeNC exhibits the best electrocatalytic performance for urea oxidation with the highest UOR peak current density (0.157 A mg(-1)) and long-time current density (0.013 A mg(-1) after 5000 s) when compared with Ir3Sn/C, Ir/FeNC and Ir/C electrocatalysts. This multi-component Ir(3)5n/FeNC catalyst presents great potential for the development of urea fuel cells. (C) 2020 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Superhydrophilicity and Electronic Modulation on Self-Supported
   Lignin-Derived Carbon Coupled with NiO@MoNi4 for Enhancing
   Urea Electrolysis
SO SMALL
AB Developing highly efficient biomass-derived carbon-based electrocatalysts remains challenging for urea electrolysis because most of these electrocatalysts show powder morphology, which can lead to Ostwald ripening during the reaction process, and its reaction mechanism should be further verified. Herein, self-supported lignin-derived carbon coupling NiO@MoNi4 heterojunction (NiO@MoNi4/C) possesses superhydrophilic properties and electronic modulation, boosting the performance of urea electrolysis. Electrochemical results show that an indirect oxidation step for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs on the surface of NiO@MoNi4/C. It displays low potentials for UOR (E10/500/1000 = 1.28/1.41/1.47 V) and for HER (E-10/-500/-1000 = -38/-264/-355 mV) in 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M urea electrolyte solution. The good activity is ascribed to the self-supported lignin-derived carbon and heterojunction, which increases the number of active sites, optimizes electronic structure, and improves electron transfer. Benefiting from the self-supported lignin-derived carbon, NiO@MoNi4/C demonstrates corrosion resistance and superhydrophilicity, which avoids Ostwald ripening and accelerates gas-liquid transfer, thus, maintaining for 100 h at +/- 1000/+/- 1500 mA cm-2 during the UOR and HER test. This work provides a good catalyst for urea electrolysis and presents a promising way for preparing lignin-derived carbon-based catalysts while expanding the application of lignin-based biomass carbon materials.

TI Small-Scale Detonation of Industrial Urea-Hydrogen Peroxide (UHP)
SO PROPELLANTS EXPLOSIVES PYROTECHNICS
AB The adduct of Urea and Hydrogen Peroxide (UHP), also called Carbamide Peroxide, is industrially produced as a solid source of hydrogen peroxide for bleaching, disinfection, and oxidation reactions. As a chemical combination of fuel and oxidiser, UHP has explosive potential but it is unclear whether it could sustain a detonation at small scale. In the configuration we tested, we succeeded in recording self-sustained detonation at relatively small scale under heavy confinement, measuring a maximum experimental velocity of detonation of 3860 m/s at an optimum 1.1 g/cm(3) loading density. UHP can sustain a detonation, even at the 100 g scale, but this is strongly dependant on booster size, confinement material, loading density, charge length and diameter. According to our performance assessment, pure UHP exhibits the behaviour of a non-ideal tertiary explosive. Maximum calculated detonation pressures are below 10 GPa, the order of magnitude for commercial blasting explosives. Small-scale results are consistent with literature values from large-scale experiments, although literature on the matter is quite limited. The proposed experimental method can be used to quantify the detonability and performance of other industrial materials that may have energetic properties, or small samples of homemade explosive compositions, avoiding time-consuming, expensive and potentially hazardous large-scale experiments.

TI An effective strategy for preparing nickel nanoparticles encapsulated in
   polymer matrix-derived carbon shell with high catalytic activity and
   long-term durability toward urea electro-oxidation
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Direct urea fuel cells have been recognised as a potential approach for sustainable development. However, the low catalytic activity of urea oxidation has hindered its practical application. Herein, by employing a facile pyrolysis strategy, we successfully synthesised nano-sized nickel particles encapsulated in a carbon shell supported on carbon nanofibers. The morphology and structure of the synthesised catalysts were characterised by TGA, XRD, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, and XPS. The catalytic activity of the catalysts toward the electro-oxidation of urea was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. Ni@2CS/CNF was found to possess the smallest size and uniform particle distribution on the carbon support, thus manifesting exceptional performance and remarkable long-term durability. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the nickel-encapsulated by carbon shell can be applied for urea oxidation as an efficient catalyst in direct urea fuel cells.

TI 4f-2p-3d Orbital Coupling in Ce-Ni3S2 Enhancing
   the Urea Oxidation Reaction
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) provides a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for various renewable energy-related systems owing to its lower thermodynamic barriers. However, its optimization and commercial utilization were hampered due to a lack of mechanistic understanding. Here, we demonstrate a Ce-doped Ni3S2 catalyst supported on Ni foam (Ce-Ni3S2/NF) with superior activity toward UOR. The resultant Ce-Ni3S2/NF catalyst exhibits a lower Tafel slope of 20.3 mV dec(-1), a higher current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.39 V versus RHE, and better durability than those for Ni3S2/NF. Based on in situ synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and in situ Raman spectroscopy, we observe the structural reconstruction of sulfide and identify the adsorbed intermediates during UOR. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ce can regulate the electronic structure of Ni through Ce(4f)-O(2p)-Ni(3d) orbital electronic coupling. The modulated Ni sites have weaker adsorption of carbonaceous intermediates, thus accelerating the UOR. This work provides a promising route for the design of high-activity UOR catalysts.

TI Hydrogen production for photocatalytic decomposition of water with urea
   as a reducing agent
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
CT 9th International Conference on Environmental Catalysis (ICEC)
CY JUL 10-13, 2016
CL Newcastle, AUSTRALIA
AB Urea is expected to be used as a reducing agent in the photocatalytic formation of hydrogen from water because it is a non-petroleum material and abundant in domestic wastewater. In this study, a TiO2 catalyst co-doped with tantalum(V) and a trivalent metal cation, serving as promoters, was applied for the photocatalytic decomposition of water for hydrogen production using urea as the reducing agent. Co-doping of TiO2 with tantalum(V) and a trivalent metal cation resulted in a considerable redshift of the absorption edge of TiO2 via the formation of impurity levels. In particular, the incorporation of tantalum(V) and chromium(III) into TiO2 resulted in significant performance enhancement for the photocatalytic decomposition of water for hydrogen production. The products obtained from the photodecomposition of water with urea were also identified, and urea was transformed into N-2 and CO2 during the reaction. Moreover, the reaction was performed using thin-film photocatalysts based on organic semiconductors, such as picene, representing a class of novel, unconventional photocatalytic materials. Picene thin-films exhibited activity similar to that exhibited by traditional inorganic semiconductors. Effective utilisation of urea has potential application in a green and sustainable production of hydrogen from wastewater via photocatalysis using various semiconductors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI High efficiency of osmotically stable laccase for biotransformation and
   micro-detoxification of levofloxacin in the urea-containing solution:
   Catalytic performance and mechanism
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES
AB Laccase-catalyzed oxidation was applied in the biotransformation of levofloxacin (a potentially environmental antibiotic contamination); however, the enzyme may denature in urea-containing wastewater and lead to the formation of an inactive form followed by decreasing the yield of the bio-removal. In this study, the osmolytes-stabilized laccase was used to eliminate levofloxacin in the urea-containing solution. Sorbitol and proline 100 mM appeared to be the two most efficient laccase protectants against the urea-induced denaturation. In a 1-M urea solution, the maximum velocity (V-max) of laccase was estimated to be 39.1 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1). This value was improved to 101.7 and 51.8 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) in the presence of sorbitol and proline, respectively. In optimal conditions for the elimination of levofloxacin, sorbitol-and proline-treated laccase led to 82.9 % and 76.2 % bio-removal of the applied fluoroquinolone in 1 M urea solution, respectively. Biotransformation products of the parent antibiotic were spectroscopically analyzed that assigned to different reaction pathways including demethylation, defluorination, decarboxylation, deamination, and hydroxylation. A micro-toxicity study con-cerning the growth of some Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria exhibited decreasing in inhibition of laccase-treated levofloxacin after a 10-h incubation at 37 degrees C.

TI One-pot synthesis and immobilization of urea-derived graphitic carbon
   nitride onto ceramic foams for visible-light photocatalytic wet peroxide
   oxidation in water treatment
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A straightforward one-pot in-situ method was employed to successfully obtain urea-derived graphitic carbon nitride (CN) deposited onto a macro-reticulated ceramic alumina-based foam (AF). The resulting CN-coated foams (CN-F) were characterized by different techniques (SEM, N-2 adsorption, DRUV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopy), revealing that CN-F structures have visible light absorption and distinctive photoluminescence properties. Moreover, these CN-F materials were investigated for the first time in water treatment, specifically for the degradation of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in aqueous solutions under visible-LED irradiation and continuous flow mode with total recirculation. The photocatalytic activity of different CN-F was investigated using various CN loads, without or with addition of H2O2 (i.e. Photocatalysis - PC or photocatalytic wet peroxide oxidation - PCWPO, respectively), at different pH (5.0 - 8.5) and a tentative reaction mechanism was described. Thus CN-F with 13.5 mg(CN)center dot g(AF)(-1) performed better than with other loads in PCWPO, as demonstrated by a higher conversion of H2O2 and SMX into reaction by-products (short-chain acids and inorganic ions belonging to organic N- or S-containing species). This photocatalyst also succeeded when tested in continuous dead-end mode operation with SMX in ultrapure water or a mixture of 6 pharmaceutical substances (500 ppb each) spiked in a natural river water sample, demonstrating an excellent visible-light PCWPO activity preventing fouling over the catalyst, achieving lower phytotoxicity for the treated water and showing a prolonged stability under 72 h, without CN detachment or any loss of material.

SO EBIOMEDICINE
AB Background: Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a condition characterized by small intestine inflammation and abnormal gut permeability, is widespread in children in developing countries and a major cause of growth failure. The pathophysiology of EED remains poorly understood.
   Methods: We measured serum metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 400 children, aged 12-59 months, from rural Malawi. Gut permeability was assessed by the dual-sugar absorption test.
   Findings: 80.7% of children had EED. Of 677 serum metabolites measured, 21 were negatively associated and 56 were positively associated with gut permeability, using a false discovery rate approach (q < 0.05, p < 0.0095). Increased gut permeability was associated with elevated acylcarnitines, deoxycarnitine, fatty acid beta-oxidation intermediates, fatty acid omega - oxidation products, odd-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide, cystathionine, and homocitrulline, and with lower citrulline, ornithine, polyphenol metabolites, hippurate, tryptophan, and indolelactate.
   Interpretation: EED is a syndrome characterized by secondary carnitine deficiency, abnormal fatty acid oxidation, alterations in polyphenol and amino acid metabolites, and metabolic dysregulation of sulfur amino acids, tryptophan, and the urea cycle. Future studies are needed to corroborate the presence of secondary carnitine deficiency among children with EED and to understand how these metabolic derangements may negatively affect the growth and development of young children.

TI Surface engineering of hierarchical Ni(OH)2
   nanosheet@nanowire configuration toward superior urea electrolysis
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB In order to resolve the pollution and waste caused by urea-rich wastewater, designing superior and stable earth-abundant catalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) have always been attractive and urgent but still challenging. Herein, we report on a facile surface-engineering strategy of building hierarchical nickel hydroxide nanosheet@nanowire array on Ni foam (Ni(OH)(2) NS@NW/Ni foam) as anode material toward superior urea electrolysis. This Ni(OH)(2) based-catalyst with peculiar nanosheet@nanowire configuration just requires a small potential of 0.34 V (vs. SCE) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, which outperforms the one with pure nanosheet array architecture and even the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Further, a two-electrode electrolysis system is built here with the cathode of cobalt phosphide nanowire array on Ni foam (Co2P NW/Ni foam) and anode of Ni(OH)(2) NS@NW/Ni foam for overall urea electrolysis, which needs a low voltage of 1.58 V to drive 5 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. Note that, the current density presented in this work is based on the real surface area of Ni foam but not the geometric area, unless otherwise specified. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Interface engineering in Ni(OH)2/NiOOH heterojunction to
   enhance energy-efficient hydrogen production via urea
   electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Electrochemical urea electrolysis has merged as a promising alternative to conventional water splitting methods for hydrogen fuel production due to its cost-effectiveness and superior energy efficiency. The utilization of heterostructures has been proposed as a viable strategy to improve the efficiency of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) by augmenting the quantity of active sites and optimizing the electronic structure. In this study, a Ni (OH)(2)/NiOOH heterojunction, referred to as H-Ni, was synthesized via a straightforward hydrothermal synthesis method. The notable performance of H-Ni in UOR is ascribed to the synergistic interaction between Ni(OH)(2) and NiOOH, which constitute the principal components of the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the H-Ni composite is capable of modulating the d-band center, thereby enhancing the adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates and decreasing the Gibbs free energy (Delta G) associated with the rate-determining step (RDS) of the UOR. Experimental results from catalytic performance tests indicate that the HNi-140 catalyst attains a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing 0.33 M urea at a relatively low potential of 1.341 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), thereby highlighting its superior electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the catalyst requires only a cell voltage of 1.78 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA.cm(-2), which is approximately 120 mV lower than that required for water electrolysis. This work presents a straightforward methodology for the cost-effective development of heterojunction catalysts.

TI The long-term effects of using nitrite and urea on the enrichment of
   comammox bacteria
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The discovery of complete ammonia oxidizer (comammox) was a breakthrough in the study of nitrification. However, slow growth of comammox bacteria makes it challenging to distinguish themfrom traditional ammonia oxidizing microorganisms. Genomic data indicated that comammox bacteria encoded genes that can metabolize urea and had higher nitrite tolerance, which could only be found in several ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). This implies that using nitrite and urea as nitrogen sources may accelerate comammox bacteria's enrichment efficiency. In this study, two reactors using nitrite and urea as substrates, respectively, were operated for 390 days. At the end of cultivation, the reactor fed with urea exhibited higher nitrification potential than the reactor fed with nitrite. Comammox bacteria outcompeted AOA and AOB, regardless of whether they were cultured with nitrite or urea. Using nitrite can improve the proportion of comammox amoA to total amoA of 92%, while using urea may increase the proportion of comammox bacteria among total bacteria to 14.2%. Metagenomic results implied that nitrite was converted to ammonia by nitrate reduction and absorbed by comammox bacteria. On the other hand, urea may be directly utilized as substrate. These results demonstrated that using different nitrogen sources caused niche differentiation of comammox bacteria, AOA, and AOB. Using nitrite can increase the relative abundance of comammox amoA to total amoA, while using urea can increase the quantity of comammox amoA. Comammox bacteriawere dominant among ammonia oxidizing microorganisms for both nitrite and urea cultures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Nitrogen use efficiency and nutrient partitioning in maize as affected
   by blends of controlled-release and conventional urea
SO ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
AB Blends of controlled-release urea (CRU) and conventional urea can be an alternative to conventional fertilization to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and reduce costs when applied as a single application to agricultural crops. Different indexes of NUE, grain yield, nutrient uptake and partitioning in maize (Zea mays L.) were investigated in field experiments. The treatments consisted of a single rate of 180 kg N ha(-1) with different proportions of polymer-sulfur coated urea (PSCU) and conventional urea (U) applied incorporated at sowing (0.05 m below and 0.1 m to the side of the seed row) at two tropical sites (Site 1, Typic Haplustox; Site 2, Rhodic Haplustox) in Brazil. A control treatment (without urea-N) and a treatment with conventional urea management (UCM: 20% of urea-N applied as basal fertilizer and 80% of N applied as top dressing) were also included. This study demonstrates that blends of PSCU and U are efficient in supplying N throughout the maize cycle at a Typic Haplustox site when applied in a single application incorporated at sowing, resulting in high yields and adequate macronutrient uptake. PSCU improved NUE index compared to U and UCM. There was not response for N fertilization in the Rhodic Haplustox site.

TI Novel Ni foam based nickel oxalate derived porous NiO nanostructures as
   highly efficient electrodes for the electrooxidation of methanol/ethanol
   and urea
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In this paper, porous NiO with three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures are prepared by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) process in oxalic acid solution at a fixed temperature using Ni foam (NF) as the substrate and Ni source, and followed by an electrochemical activation treatment in an alkaline medium. The special 3D porous structure of the as-prepared NF based NiO (NiO/NF) electrode is benefit for the diffusion of fuels (CH3OH/C2H5OH and urea) during the electrochemical reaction. Besides, the obtained NiO may combine with the remained nickel oxalate (NiC2O4) to further enhance the catalytic performance due to its synergistic effect. At 0.60 V, the electrooxidation current density reached 257mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol dm(-3) NaOH and 0.40 mol dm(-3) CH3OH, and a high performance of 120mA cm(-2) was achieved in 1.0mol dm(-3) NaOH and 0.10 mol dm(-3) C2H5OH. The oxidation current density reached 222 mAcm(-2) in 0.1 mol dm(-3) urea with the NaOH concentration of 8.0 mol dm(-3) at around 0.48 V. The facile preparation method, high electrocatalytic activity, low cost and various applications make the NiO/NF be a promising electrode material. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis via N2 Dimerization and
   Universal Descriptor
SO ACS NANO
AB Electrocatalytic urea synthesis through N-2 + CO2 coreduction and C-N coupling is a promising and sustainable alternative to harsh industrial processes. Despite considerable efforts, limited progress has been made due to the challenges of breaking inert N equivalent to N bonds for C-N coupling, competing side reactions, and the absence of theoretical principles guiding catalyst design. In this study, we propose a mechanism for highly electrocatalytic urea synthesis using two adsorbed N-2 molecules and CO as nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. This mechanism circumvents the challenging step of N equivalent to N bond breaking and selective CO2 to CO reduction, as the free CO molecule inserts into dimerized *N-2 and binds concurrently with two N atoms, forming a specific urea precursor *NNCONN* with both thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility. Through the proposed mechanism, Ti-2@C4N3 and V-2@C4N3 are identified as highly active catalysts for electrocatalytic urea formation, exhibiting low onset potentials of -0.741 and -0.738 V, respectively. Importantly, taking transition metal atoms anchored on porous graphite-like carbonitride (TM2@C4N3) as prototypes, we introduce a simple descriptor, namely, effective d electron number (Phi), to quantitatively describe the structure-activity relationships for urea formation. This descriptor incorporates inherent atomic properties of the catalyst, such as the number of d electrons, the electronegativity of the metal atoms, and the generalized electronegativity of the substrate atoms, making it potentially applicable to other urea catalysts. Our work advances the comprehension of mechanisms and provides a universal guiding principle for catalyst design in urea electrochemical synthesis.

TI SiBOC foams from methylvinylborosiloxane using urea crystals as a pore
   template and ethylenediamine as a gelling agent
SO JOURNAL OF THE AUSTRALIAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB A simple urea crystal templating method is reported for the preparation of SiBOC ceramic foams, with rectangular rod-like pores, from methylvinylborosiloxane (MVBS) preceramic polymer solution. Pastes of urea crystals in concentrated MVBS solution were filled in open rectangular mold and set by cross-linking of MVBS using ethylenediamine (EDA) at room temperature. The cross-linking is due to the formation of adduct between electron-deficient boron in the polymer backbone and lone pair of electrons in amino groups of EDA. The gelation time of 60 wt.% MVBS solution in ethanol is modulated in the range of 240 to 3.25 h using EDA concentration in the range 0.33 to 10 wt.%. The gelled body is water-washed to leach out urea, followed by inert heat treatment at 1500 degrees C to produce SiBOC foam. The SiBOC ceramic foams of density 0.739 to 0.215 g cm(-3), compressive strength 2.75 to 0.207 MPa, and thermal conductivity 0.262 to 0.073 W m(-1) K-1 were achieved with urea concentrations of 50 to 88 vol.%. SEM micrographs show rectangular rod-like pores resulting from the urea particle template, which increases with an increase in urea concentration. XRD and TEM confirm SiBOC as amorphous, with the presence of a few nanocrystals of beta-SiC and turbostratic carbon layers. The low thermal conductivity, excellent oxidation resistance, and reasonably high compressive strength make the prepared foams suitable candidate for high temperature thermal protection in aerospace.

TI Effect of Urea as a Shape-Controlling Agent on the Properties of Bismuth
   Oxybromides
SO CATALYSTS
AB Bismuth oxybromides were prepared via a solvothermal method by applying different urea amounts during synthesis. The effects of the urea ratio on the morpho-structural properties and photocatalytic activity of the samples were investigated. X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and surface tension measurements were carried out to characterize the samples. Their photoactivity was evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B and ibuprofen under UV and visible light irradiations. The urea ratio notably influenced morphology, particle size distribution, and photoactivity. However, it only had a limited effect on the crystalline composition, primary crystallite size, and band gap of bismuth oxybromides. The formation of Bi-based complexes and degraded urea-based products were observed, which were deduced to influence band gap energies and hence, photoactivity. Predominantly, samples prepared at low urea ratios proved to be the best for both rhodamine B and ibuprofen degradations under both irradiations.

TI High-current-density PB@S-NiCo nanorod array catalyst for urea-assisted
   water splitting
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB To alleviate severe environmental and energy pressures, urea oxidation reaction (UOR) was frequently studied as an alternative electrochemical hydrogen production anode reaction for its low theoretical voltage. Herein, a series of self -supported UOR catalysts were synthesized on the combination of PB nanoparticles and sulfur doped NiCoCO 3 (OH) 2 nanorod arrays (PB@S-NiCo NRA) on copper foam. By changing the modifying time of S-NiCo NRA precursor in K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] solution, PB@S-NiCo-X (X=10, 60, 120 for reaction time) were obtained. The highly hydrophilic heterostructure array can adjust the interface electronic structure and accelerate the mass transfer process, thereby optimizing the thermal/kinetic dynamics of urea electrolysis hydrogen production. Over the typical PB@S-NiCo-60 catalyst, only 1.48 V (UOR) and 1.83 V (overall urea electrolysis) were required to drive a large current density of 500 mA cm -2 , showing excellent electrocatalytic activities of the composite catalysts. Furthermore, PB component in the composite catalyst enhanced the reaction kinetics to achieve good stability at high current densities. This study provides new ideas for durable urea electrolysis -assisted H 2 production.

TI Vanadium-Doped Bimetallic Nanoporous Metal-Organic Frameworks as
   Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Production
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Water electrolysis is considered a compelling path for generating ecofriendly and sustainable hydrogen fuel. To realize highly effective electrocatalytic water splitting, improving anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is key because of its high overpotential. The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising method instead of the OER. Herein, a series of bimetallic nanoporous M2V-MOF materials (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) with vanadium doping is successfully synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method and the materials are applied as electrocatalysts for water and urea electrolysis. Among the as-synthesized M2V-MOF materials, Fe2V-MOF as an impressive trifunctional electrocatalyst has very low overpotentials of 291 mV@10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, 1.48 V@50 mA cm(-2) for the UOR, and 182 mV@-10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Adapting it as a cathode and anode electrode for water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, a low cell voltage of 1.73 V is required for delivering 10 mA cm(-2). The urea-assisted electrolysis cell only needs 1.63 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits excellent stability over 60 h.

TI Carbon Anchored Epitaxially Grown Nickel Cobalt-Based Carbonate
   Hydroxide for Urea Electrooxidation Reaction with a High Activity and
   Durability
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB Urea has shown a potential importance as a possible alternative hydrogen-storage source for low-temperature fuel cells. Besides, the electrooxidation of urea provides an efficient solution for the disposal of wastewater in the agricultural industry, but the state-of-the art urea electrocatalysis suffers from the associated sluggish kinetics. In this study, we fabricated unique vertically aligned nanorod arrays-like carbon anchored nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxides (C-NiCo CHs) without agglomeration through a mass scale one-step hydrothermal approach for electrocatalytic oxidation of urea in an alkaline environment. The composite affords a high specific surface area of 162.55 m(2) g(-1) with distinctive porous features, suggesting a large surface exposure and sufficient electrolyte accessibility during chemical reactions. The catalyst exhibits an outstanding electrocatalytic activity towards urea electrooxidation with a high current density and an outstanding durability benefiting from the tuned electric conductivity. Impressively, the hybrid shows a greatly improved catalytic performance at higher KOH moieties with a much-enhanced peak current and a negatively shifted onset voltage, which can be interpreted by the intensive Ni activation processes caused by the densely formed OH- ions. These findings signify that the well-developed nanoarchitecture of C-NiCo CHs hybrid could pave the way to rationally fabricate highly active electrocatalysts for urea electrocatalysis.

TI Effects of nano manganese dioxide on performances of urea-formaldehyde
   resin
SO JOURNAL OF ADHESION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In cured urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin with low molar ratio of formaldehyde/urea (F/U), existent crystalline regions are believed to affect the properties of wood-based composites bonded with UF resins. The effects of crystalline regions on physicomechanical properties and formaldehyde emission of the plywood bonded with UF resin modified by nano Manganese dioxide (MnO2) were studied in this work. Results show that the modified UF resins with 0.9% MnO2 has a higher ratio of crystalline regions than those of neat resins. They resulted in a 79% improvement in the wet shear strength and a 70% reduction in the formaldehyde emission. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that the crystallinity in the cured UF increases with the amount of MnO2 added. No change in the structure of the cured UF was found in the Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) with the addition of MnO2.

TI Hydrogen-Bond-Enhanced Photoreforming of Biomass Furans over a
   Urea-Incorporated Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Solar-driven upgrading of biomass-derived 5-hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) holds great promise for sustainable production of bio-plastics and resins. However, the process is limited by poor selectivity and sluggish kinetics due to the vertical coordination of HMF at relatively strong metal sites. Here, we purposely developed a Cu(II) porphyrin framework featuring side-chain incorporated urea linkages, denoted as TBUPP-Cu MOF, to render HMF a weak hydrogen bond at the urea site and flat adsorption via pi-pi stacking with the benzene moiety. The unique configuration promotes the approaching of -CHO of HMF to the photoexcited porphyrin ring towards kinetically and thermodynamically favourable intermediate formation and subsequent desorption. The charge localisation and orbital energy alignment enable the selective activation of O-2 over the porphyrin to generate & sdot;O-2(-) and O-1(2) instead of highly oxidative H2O2 and & sdot;OH via spin-flip electron transfer, which drive the ambient oxidation of proximal -CHO. The effective utilisation of redox species and circumvented over-oxidation facilitate a FDCA selectivity of >90 % with a high turnover number of 193 mol(HMF) mol(Cu)(-1). The facile purification of high-purity FDCA and zero-waste recycling of intermediates and durable catalyst feature TBUPP-Cu MOF a promising photo-oxidation platform towards net-zero biorefining and organic transformations.

TI Self-driven Ru-modified NiFe MOF nanosheet as multifunctional
   electrocatalyst for boosting water and urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Urea electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) has been a promising strategy to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by urea-mediated water splitting for hydrogen production. Naturally, rational design of highefficiency and multifunctional electrocatalyst towards UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of vital significance, but still a grand challenge. Herein, an innovative 3D Ru-modified NiFe metalorganic framework (MOF) nanoflake array on Ni foam (Ru-NiFe-x/NF) was elaborately designed via spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction (GRR). Notably, the adsorption capability of intermediate species (H*) of catalyst is significantly optimized by Ru modification. Meanwhile, rich high-valence Ni active species can be acquired by self-driven electronic reconstruction in the interface, then dramatically accelerating the electrolysis of water and urea. Remarkably, the optimized Ru-NiFe-(R)/NF (1.6 at% of Ru) only requires the overpotential of 90 and 310 mV to attain 100 mA cm(-2) toward HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Impressively, an ultralow voltage of 1.47 V is required for Ru-NiFe-(R)/NF to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in urea-assisted electrolysis cell with superior stability, which is 190 mV lower than that of Pt/C-NF parallel to RuO2/NF couple. This work is desired to explore a facile way to exploit environmentally-friendly energy by coupling hydrogen evolution with urea-rich sewage disposal. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Water splitting by CoFeLDH@NiFeS nanoelectrocatalyst assisted urea
   electrooxidation reaction
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB In this paper, NiFeS@CoFeLDH nanostructure was synthesized for the first time by electrochemical method in two steps. In the first stage, the first layer of NiFeS was deposited on the nickel foam (NF) substrate, and in the second stage, the second layer of cobalt-iron layered double hydroxide (CoFeLDH)by controlling the electro-deposition condition was deposited on the first. The deposition time and potential were optimized. The opti-mized NiFeS@CoFeLDH coating on NF has promising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, which exhibits small overpotentials of -191.5, and -304.0, at the current densities of -10, and -100 mA. cm-2, respectively. Furthermore, the synthesized NiFeS@CoFeLDH electrocatalyst only needs 358 mV overpotentials to operate at a current density of 10 mA. cm-2 indicating its great performance for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The electrode stability was examined at an industrial scale current density of -100 and 10 mA. cm-2 for HER and UOR respectively, which showed a very stable response for at least 10 h. The results showed that the simulta-neous application of NiFeS and CoFeLDH electrocatalysts has a synergistic effect that increases the surface-to-volume ratio and improves the active sites. According to high performance for HER and UOR and also simple, fast, and binder-free synthesis without using expensive materials for preparing the electrocatalyst layer, the proposed electrode can be used as a good candidate for water splitting in the presence of urea.

TI Electronic modulation of Co2P nanoneedle arrays by the doping
   of transition metal Cr atoms for a urea oxidation reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Urea electrolysis is of great interest for energy-related applications, but it is limited by a complex six-electron transfer process with slow kinetics. Herein, the in situ growth of Cr-doped Co2P homogeneous nanoneedle arrays on nickel foam substrates (Cr-Co2P/NF) was reported for the first time by a typical hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphorization process. The appropriate amount of Cr doping was found to promote the electronic modulation of active centers and the expansion of the specific active surface area, resulting in the superior performance of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). It is noteworthy that Cr-0.4-Co2P/NF exhibited a superior performance of the UOR at an onset potential of 1.290 V and a cell voltage of 1.333 V at 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. The experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to favorable electronic regulation, an improved charge transfer rate and increased exposure to active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the appropriate doping of Cr effectively regulates and controls the adsorption energy of urea and the conductivity of the Co2P material itself. This work provides new ideas for the development of robust catalysts for the electrolysis of urea through doping strategies.

SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB A highly sensitive non-enzymatic urea sensor was fabricated using nickel oxide deposited on a cellulose/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite. The structure and morphological properties of the NiO/cellulose/CNT composite were investigated using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. A thin film of the NiO/cellulose/CNT composite was coated on an indium tin oxide glass to fabricate an amperometric urea sensor. The composition of the modified electrode and detection conditions (i.e., pH and temperature) were optimized. The prepared electrode exhibited an excellent sensitivity of 371 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) with a fast response time of 4 s. The electrode also showed high stability with only a 3.6% decrease in its sensitivity after storage for two months under ambient conditions. In addition, the feasibility for urea analysis in urine samples was demonstrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Self-Supported Mn-Ni3Se2 Electrocatalysts for
   Water and Urea Electrolysis for Energy-Saving Hydrogen Production
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Recently, there has been a huge research interest in developing robust, efficient, low-cost, and earth-abundant materials for water and urea electrolysis for hydrogen (H-2) generation. Herein, we demonstrate the facile hydrothermal synthesis of self-supported Mn-Ni3Se2 on Ni foam for overall water splitting under wide pH conditions. With the optimized concentration of Mn in Ni3Se2, the overpotential for hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and urea oxidation is significantly reduced by an enhanced electrochemical active surface area. Different electronic states of metal elements also produce a synergistic effect, which accelerates the rate of electrochemical reaction for water and urea electrolysis. Owing to the chemical robustness, Mn-doped Ni3Se2 shows excellent stability for long time duration, which is important for its practical applications. A two-electrode electrolyzer exhibits low cell voltages of 2.02 and 1.77 V for water and urea electrolysis, respectively, to generate a current density of 100 mA/cm(2). Finally, the prepared nanostructured Mn-Ni3Se2@NF acts as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting under wide pH conditions and urea electrolysis for energy-saving hydrogen production and wastewater treatment.

TI Three-dimensional core-shell structured
   NiCo2O4@CoS/Ni-Foam electrocatalyst for oxygen
   evolution reaction and electrocatalytic oxidation of urea
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Rational construction of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for energy generation and environmental electrooxidation receives attention because of their simplicity, versatility, and high efficiency. In this study, a novel core-shell electroactive material architecture is developed by electrodepositing cobalt sulfide shell over core NiCo2O4 structure on Ni-Foam substrate, which is developed by hydrothermal process. The synergistic effect of the three-dimensional chrysanthemum-like NiCo(2)O(4 )with CoS shell exhibits superior activity towards oxygen evolution reaction with high durability and lower onset potential obtained at 1.52 V vs. RHE (over-potential 290 mV @ 10 mA/cm(2)) in alkaline solution. The electron pairs from NiCo2O4 and CoS along with increased active sites from their interfacial interaction considerably improve the charge transfer phenomena. The electrocatalytic activity in the presence of urea is also investigated, which aids in reducing the onset potential to 118.4 mV vs. RHE. A considerably higher current density of 78 mA/cm(2) is achieved at the potential of 0.5 V, which is comparatively higher than that of other electrocatalysts. Thus, the activity from sulfide/oxide core-shell architectures proves to have a high potential in efficient electrochemical reactivity producing green energy.

TI Fe-doping induced electronic structure reconstruction in Ni-based
   metal-organic framework for improved energy-saving hydrogen production
   via urea degradation
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Urea-assisted water electrolysis provides an energy-saving strategy toward hydrogen evolution and wastewaterrelevant environmental crisis. Efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea oxidization reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the key to solve these challenges. Herein, we demonstrated a Fe-doped Nibased MOF nanosheet arrays (FeNi-MOF NSs) through one-step hydrothermal synthesis for efficient energysaving urea-assisted water electrolysis. When applied for UOR, such prepared FeNi-MOF NSs achieves a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 at overpotentials of 131 and 155 mV, respectively. Based on both comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations, the excellent UOR performance can be attributed to that the Fe-doping caused electronic structure reconstruction in MOF, which not only induced the formation of abundant high-valence Ni as active centers for UOR, but also created more electronic states with optimized adsorption energies of reactant and product molecules on the surface, benefiting the UOR kinetics. Based on the UOR and HER activities of FeNi-MOF NSs, a urea electrolyser has been assembled, which affords 10 mA cm-2 current density at a low cell voltage of 1.431 V with excellent stability during long-term electrolysis.

TI A versatile Fe2+/urea hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation process for
   not only organoarsenic remediation but also nitrogen supplement in soil
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Organoarsenics in soil urgently desired careful remediation. Unfortunately, it did not receive enough attention. Herein, we report a versatile Fe2+/Urea Hydrogen Peroxide (UHP) process for not only organoarsenic remediation but also nitrogen supplement in soil. Insight mechanism was firstly studied in water. Roxarsone (ROX) was efficiently degraded by 99.6% following a kinetics of v= 33.91 x [ROX]x [UHP]1.2175 x [Fe2+]1.8990. Aromatic ring cleavage of ROX was realized, resulting in a satisfying mineralization performance. After degradation processes, 88.5% of total arsenic was removed from the solution at pH 5.0 via adsorption processes by generated Fe(OH)3 particles. The particles showed much higher adsorption capacity to inorganic arsenic species than that to organoarsenic. The degradation of ROX facilitated the immobilization of total arsenic. The remediation was further carried out in soil. Satisfying removal of ROX (95.5%) and immobilization of total arsenic (89.3%) was achieved. More importantly, 94.2%- 94.6% less arsenic was transferred into the lettuce. By the injection of Fe2+/UHP, a sixteen times higher concentration of total nitrogen was achieved. The growth of lettuce was significantly promoted due to the multi-functions including arsenic immobilization and nitrogen supplement. The achievements suggested Fe2+/UHP system potentials in applications for organoarsenic remediation in soil and also soil amelioration.

TI Engineered CoS/Ni3S2 Heterointerface Catalysts
   Grown Directly on Carbon Paper as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Urea
   Oxidation
SO CATALYSTS
AB Developing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for urea electro-oxidation reactions (UORs) will improve wastewater treatment and energy conversion. A low-cost cobalt sulfide-anchored nickel sulfide electrode (CoS/Ni3S2@CP) was synthesized by electrodeposition in DMSO solutions and found to be highly effective and long-lasting. The morphology and composition of catalyst surfaces were examined using comprehensive physicochemical and electrochemical characterization. Specifically, CoS/Ni3S2@CP electrodes require a potential of 1.52 volts for a 50 mA/cm(2) current, confirming CoS in the heterointerface CoS/Ni3S2@CP catalyst. Further, the optimized CoS/Ni3S2@CP catalyst shows a decrease of 100 mV in the onset potential (1.32 V-RHE) for UORs compared to bare Ni3S2@CP catalysts (1.42 V-RHE), demonstrating much greater performance of UORs. As compared to Ni3S2@CP, CoS/Ni3S2@CP exhibits twofold greater UOR efficiency as a result of a larger electroactive surface area. The results obtained indicate that the synthetic CoS/Ni3S2@CP catalyst may be a favorable electrode material for managing urea-rich wastewater and generating H-2.

TI In-situ reconstitution of Ni(III)-based active sites from vanadium doped
   nickel phosphide/metaphosphate for super-stable urea-assisted water
   electrolysis at large current densities
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea electrooxidation reaction (UOR) are urgently needed for hydrogen production from urea-containing wastewater electrolysis. The main challenge lies in the sluggish UOR kinetics and the stability of catalyst under practical high current density. Here, a vanadium doped heterostructure of Ni(PO3)2/Ni2P with shaggy nanosheet morphology was successfully synthesized. The doping of V atoms promotes the formation of Ni(PO3)2/Ni2P heterojunction in phosphating process. It is demonstrated that V-doped Ni(PO3)2/Ni2P accelerates the generation of real active site V@NiOOH in OER and UOR processes, which can also be stabilized by the PO3- ions. The in-situ formed V@NiOOH increases the adsorption energy of urea molecule, and reduces the adsorption energy of key intermediates *COO, thus facilitating the release of CO2 product from the catalyst surface. The energy barrier of *HNCON to *NCON is also reduced dramatically, promoting the kinetics of UOR. In addition, the shaggy nanosheets morphology provides large number of catalytic sites and transport channels, which are conducive to mass transfer under high current density. As a result, the V-Ni(PO3)2/Ni2P electrode based anion-exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer needs only 1.61 V to drive the total urea electrolysis at an industrial grade current density of 550 mA cm-2 with an outstanding durability of 700 h. This work paves the way for designing practical efficient and stable electrocatalyst for urea contained wastewater electrolysis to produce hydrogen.

TI Facile fabrication of amorphous NiFeP nanosheets to promote urea
   oxidation reaction for energy-saving hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Although Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with favorable thermodynamic potential has been well-acknowledged as a feasible alternative to slow oxygen evolution reaction for hydrogen production through water splitting, but the shortage of low-cost and high efficiency electrocatalysts restricts its practical development. In this research, a free-standing nickel-iron-phosphide (NiFeP) nanosheets electrocatalysts on nickel foam is synthesized by electrodeposition method. The presence of phosphide (P) causes nickel-iron (NiFe) to evolve from crystalline to amorphous structures. The NiFeP electrocatalysts with nanosheets structure exhibit reliable electrocatalytic activities toward UOR with small potential of 1.397 V at 10 mA cm-2, low Tafel slope of 60.1 mV dec-1 and outstanding catalytic stability in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea solution. More impressively, the electrochemical activation energy (Ea) of UOR for the NiFeP electrocatalyst (35.6 kJ mol-1) is much lower than that of NiFe electrocatalyst (52.1 kJ mol-1). The phosphorus doping triggers the electronic structure of Ni and Fe site reconstruction, which is conducive to accelerating charge and mass transport, and then contributes to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the formation of amorphous structure and nanosheets structure by the incorporation of phosphorus contributes to the improved intrinsic activity of NiFeP for UOR.

TI Rose-like Cu-doped Ni3S2 nanoflowers decorated
   with thin NiFe LDH nanosheets for high-efficiency overall water and urea
   electrolysis
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Water electrolysis is a promising way to produce green hydrogen energy but still limited by the sluggish anodic oxidation kinetics. Herein, we firstly introduced a multifunctional electrocatalyst of rose-like Cu-doped Ni3S2 nanoflowers decorated with thin NiFe LDH nanosheets (Cu-Ni3S2@NiFe LDH) with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water electrolysis performance. More impressively, CuNi3S2@NiFe LDH-200 target catalyst shows the huge potential to replace the slow OER with urea electrolysis when it is used to catalyze urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In addition, the structure-function relationship of material was highlighted and the performance of target catalyst was well revealed by analyzing the growth law of NiFe LDH on Cu-doped Ni3S(2). It's worth noting that Cu-Ni3S(2)@NiFe LDH-100 performs well for HER, while Cu-Ni3S2@NiFe LDH-200 stands out for OER and UOR. The resulting Cu-Ni3S2@NiFe LDH-200(+)//Cu-Ni3S2@NiFe LDH-100(-) electrode couple only requires 1.502 V and 1.413 V to deliver the same current density of 10 mA cm-2 for water electrolysis and urea electrolysis and catalyzed stably for over 20 h, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. Our work will open a new idea to enhance the catalytic activity and stability of transition metal sulfides with layered double hydroxides.

TI Electrochemical synthesis of urea on MBenes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Urea is an important raw material in the chemical industry and is widely used as a nitrogen source in chemical fertilizers. The current industrial urea synthesis not only requires harsh reaction conditions, but also consumes most of the NH3 obtained through artificial synthesis. The conversion of N-2 and CO2 into urea through electrochemical reactions under ambient conditions represents a novel green urea synthesis method. However, the large-scale promotion of this method is limited by the lack of suitable electrocatalysts. Here, by means of density functional theory computations, we systematically study the catalytic activity of three experimentally available two-dimensional metal borides (MBenes), Mo2B2, Ti2B2, and Cr2B2 toward simultaneous electrocatalytic coupling of N-2 and CO2 to produce urea under ambient conditions. According to our results, these three MBenes not only have superior intrinsic basal activity for urea formation, with limiting potentials ranging from -0.49 to -0.65eV, but also can significantly suppress the competitive reaction of N-2 reduction to NH3. In particular, 2D Mo2B2 and Cr2B2 possess superior capacity to suppress surface oxidation and self-corrosion under electrochemical reaction conditions, rendering them relatively promising electrocatalysts for urea production. Our work paves the way for the electrochemical synthesis of urea. The conversion of N-2 and CO2 into urea through electrochemical reactions under ambient conditions represents a novel green urea synthesis method. Here, the authors demonstrate that two-dimensional transition metal borides can serve as effective catalysts for electrochemical urea synthesis.

TI Construction of Fe-doped NiS-NiS2 Heterostructured
   Microspheres Via Etching Prussian Blue Analogues for Efficient
   Water-Urea Splitting
SO SMALL
AB Developing efficient and robust non-precious-metal-based catalysts to accelerate electrocatalytic reaction kinetics is crucial for electrochemical water-urea splitting. Herein, Fe-doped NiS-NiS2 heterostructured microspheres, an electrocatalyst, are synthesized via etching Prussian blue analogues following a controlled annealing treatment. The resulting microspheres are constructed by mesoporous nanoplates, granting the virtues of large surface areas, high structural void porosity, and accessible inner surface. These advantages not only provide more redox reaction centers but also strengthen structural robustness and effectively facilitate the mass diffusion and charge transport. Density functional theory simulations validate that the Fe-doping improves the conductivity of nickel sulfides, whereas the NiS-NiS2 heterojunctions induce interface charge rearrangement for optimizing the adsorption free energy of intermediates, resulting in a low overpotential and high electrocatalytic activity. Specifically, an ultralow overpotential of 270 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is achieved. After adding 0.33 M urea into 1 M KOH, Fe-doped NiS-NiS2 obtains a strikingly reduced urea oxidation reaction potential of 1.36 V to reach 50 mA cm(-2), around 140 mV less than OER. This work provides insights into the synergistic modulation of electrocatalytic activity of non-noble catalysts for applications in energy conversion systems.

TI Pyrazole-Mediated On-Surface Synthesis of Nickel/Nickel Oxide Hybrids
   for Efficient Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Production
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Creating densely functionalized supported materials without aggregation has been one of the ultimate goals for heterogeneous catalysts. Direct conversion of readily available bulk materials into highly dispersed supported materials could be highly beneficial for real applications. In this work, we invented an on-surface synthetic strategy for generating highly loaded and well-dispersed nickel nanoparticles on nickel oxide supports (Ni/NiO). This on-surface synthesis is a two-step process involving the surface transformation of Ni(OH)2 into a layer of chain-like nickel pyrazolate [Ni(pz)2] and an ultra-high-vacuum annealing process that evacuates the pyrazole and decomposes the Ni(OH)2 into the Ni/NiO hybrid. The highly dispersed Ni/NiO catalyst exhibited superior activities and long-term stability for both the urea oxidation reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction, which enables efficient urea electrolysis with a single catalyst. This approach presents a novel on-surface synthetic strategy for metal oxide-supported materials and offers efficient catalysts for advanced urea-assisted hydrogen production.

TI Coaxial Ni3S2@CoMoS4/NiFeOOH nanorods
   for energy-saving water splitting and urea electrolysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB High efficiency and energy-saving electrochemical hydrogen production has always been a research challenge, mainly due to the limitation of the sluggish kinetics of anodic reactions. Excellent performance depends largely on the clever design of nano-architectures and smart hybridization of active components. It is also very important to establish the relationship between structure and performance of materials. Form perspectives of chemical composition and nanostructure, we developed a novel heterostructure of Ni-3-S-2@CoMoS4/NiFeOOH coaxial nanorods on NF scaffold, in which the two-dimensional CoMoS4 nanoplates and ultrathin NiFeOOH nanosheets vertically coil around the Ni3S2 nanorods by hydrothermal reaction combined with electrodepostion process. Such hierarchical nanorods can provide the heterointerface with highly open surface, ensuring the maximization of synergistic interaction. This heterostructure results in prominent bifunctional activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis systems, and HER coupled with urea oxidation reaction in urea electrolysis devices. It exhibits very low cell voltages for alkaline water splitting (1.732 V) and urea electrolysis (1.660 V) to afford a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in the two-electrode system as well as excellent long-term stability. Our work provides a new construction for combining various active materials to competitive bifunctional electro-catalysts applied in energy-relative electrochemical devices.

TI V-doped transition metal selenides derived from NiFe Prussian blue
   analogues for efficient oxygen evolution reaction and urea oxidation
   reaction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Hydrogen production from electrolytic water is considered as an effective strategy for the preparation of clean energy. Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a decisive step for electrolytic water process due to its slow kinetics and excessively high energy barrier. In this work, Prussian blue analogue (PBA) was chosen as a sacrificial template to effectively improve the growth environment of NiFe-based electrocatalysts and V-doped NiSe, FeSe, Fe-4 center dot 4Ni(17)center dot 6Se(16) (FNSe) hybrid electrodes were synthesized using a simple in-situ immersion then multi-step hydrothermal method on a conductive substrate nickel foam (NF). V-NiSe/FeSe/FNSe/NF exhibited a unique nanomicrospheres surface-loaded nanoparticles in a unique morphology. Abundant crystal surface defects and heterojunctions can provide the advantages of a large number of active sites and accelerated electron transfer, which also can lead to the enhancement of catalytic activity, OER (overpotential of 181 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and UOR (potential of 1.31 V@10 mA cm(-2)). This study provides new ideas for the exploration of transition metal selenide electrocatalysts for electrolytic water.

TI Silver decorated nickel-cobalt (oxy)hydroxides fabricated via
   surface reconstruction engineering for boosted electrocatalytic oxygen
   evolution and urea oxidation
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Electrochemical water splitting is considered to be a promising renewable hydrogen generation technology but is significantly limited by the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Herein, a silver nanoparticle decorated nickel-cobalt (oxy)hydroxide composite is fabricated on nickel foam (Ag@NiCo(OH)(x)/NF) via electrodeposition followed by spontaneous redox reaction. Benefitting from the synergetic contributions of an amorphous/crystalline phase, abundant artificial heterointerfaces, and a 3D porous architecture, the as-designed Ag@NiCo(OH)(x)/NF shows substantially enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the OER and urea oxidation reaction. Impressively, in the urea-assisted alkaline electrolyzer (coupled with commercial Pt/C on NF as the cathode) for hydrogen production, a cell voltage of only 1.49 V is required to deliver a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of traditional water splitting (1.69 V). Importantly, this work represents a facile and feasible method to exploit efficient self-supported electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting and urea-rich wastewater purification.

TI Honeycomb-like Ni-Mo-S on Ni foam as superior bifunctional
   electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and urea oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB It is still a challenge to prepare highly-efficient electrocatalysts through a facile and controllable technology for hydrogen production. Herein, a simple electrochemical deposition method was designed for the pre-paration of honeycomb-like nickel-molybdenum-sulfur amorphous microstructures on the nickel foam (labeled as NiMoS/NF), which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The as-deposited NiMoS/NF electrode merely required overpotential of 37 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1.0 M KOH solution, and presented ultralong durability above 310 h at 10 mA cm(-2). In a mixed solution of 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, simultaneously, 1.015 V of overpotential was needed to generate the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for UOR. In a two-electrode cell with the electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, a voltage of 1.377 V was demanded to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The present work shows that the electrodeposition technology is a simple and feasible approach to construct robust and highly-active electrocatalysts for H-2 production. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Detection and Removal of Arsenite from Water Using Bis-Urea
   Supramolecular Polymer and Dipeptide Adsorbent
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB Arsenic is one of the most toxic element and contaminant of groundwater. Arsenic enters into the groundwater from natural deposits through various industrial and agricultural activities. Though arsenic can present in different oxidation states starting from -3 to +5, the trivalent As(III) (arsenite) is most toxic. A cost-effective, easy-to-use in-field arsenite sensor in aqueous media has been developed. The (6-ureicio-pyridine-2-yl)-urea has been synthesized via simple one-pot synthesis by treating 2,6-diaminopyridine with potassium cyanate at 80 C. The bis-urea can selectively sense arsenite and form a light yellow color supramolecular polymer in aqueous media even in the presence of other biologically and environmentally important ions. Various analytical techniques were employed to study the arsenite sensing, and the detection limit was found to be 73.6 nM. The immediate, accurate, selective, naked-eye detection of arsenite makes it suitable for in-field water testing. We have also developed a device packed with dipeptide and silica that can remove 71.1 % arsenite-supramolecular polymer in a single touch in 5 minutes. Notably, the filter can be used upto five cycles efficiently. The results demonstrate the potential of the bis-urea supramolecular polymer and dipeptide adsorbent for the efficient and sustainable remediation of arsenite contamination.

TI Sea urchin-like NiMoO4 nanorod arrays as highly efficient
   bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalytic/photovoltage-driven urea
   electrolysis
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB Developing multifunctional electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, long-term stability, and low cost is essential for electrocatalytic energy conversion. Herein, sea urchin-like NiMoO4 nanorod arrays grown on nickel foam has been developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution. The NiMoO4-200/NF catalyst exhibits efficient activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of only 68 mV in 1.0 mol/L KOH to gain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The NiMoO4-300/NF catalyst exhibits a prominent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity with an overpotential of 288 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), as well as for urea oxidation reaction with an ultra-low potential of 1.36 Vat 10 mA cm(-2). The observed difference in electrocatalytic activity and selectivity, derived by temperature variation, is ascribed to different lattice oxygen contents. The lattice oxygen of NiMoO4-300/NF is more than that of NiMoO4-200/NF, and the lattice oxygen is conducive to the progress of OER. A urea electrolyzer was assembled with NiMoO4-200/NF and NiMoO4-300/NF as cathode and anode respectively, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of merely 1.38 V. The NiMoO4 nanorod arrays has also been successfully applied for photovoltage-driven urea electrolysis and hydrogen production, revealing its great potential for solar-driven energy conversion.

TI Urea additive improves the performance of low bandgap tin-lead
   perovskite solar cells
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Recently, narrow bandgap tin-lead mixed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a research hotspot because they can be applied in tandem cells to break the Shockley-Queisser radiative limit of the single junction PSCs. However, the introduction of tin, on the one hand, makes the crystal quality of perovskite thin film worse, leading to the increase of film defects; on the other hand, the easy oxidation of divalent tin also leads to the increase of defect states, which seriously affects the photoelectric conversion efficiency of tin-lead cell devices. Good crystallization and low defect density of perovskite layer are very important to ensure good light absorption and photogenerated carrier generation and transport. Here, we adjust the crystallization of tin-lead perovskite films by a Lewis base-urea (CO(NH2)(2)), which significantly increases the grain size and improves the film morphology. At the same time, because of the Lewis base property of urea, the uncoordinated Pb2+ and Sn2+ defects of Lewis acids in the tin-lead films are effectively passivated, and the occurrence of non-radiative recombination in the films is reduced. Under the dual effects of improving crystallization and passivating defects, the photoelectric performance of tin-lead perovskite solar cell devices is significantly improved to 18.1% compared with the original device of 15.4%.

TI Barium-induced lattice expansion of Ni(OH)2: enhancing
   catalytic urea oxidation activity for energy-saving H2
   production
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Constructing an environmentally friendly and efficient electrocatalyst holds important and profound significance for energy-efficient hydrogen production. Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with a lower potential urea oxidation reaction (UOR) may save energy in water electrolysis to produce hydrogen. The UOR is characterized by its high energy barrier, which results in slow reaction kinetics. In this study, we introduced Ba(OH)(2) into Ni(OH)(2) to form uniform nanosheets. Due to the introduction of Ba2+, the lattice expansion of Ni(OH)(2) was triggered, leading to significant improvement in UOR activity. The catalyst achieved a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at only 1.316 V and exhibited remarkable stability over time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ba-Ni(OH)(2) site significantly reduces the energy barrier for urea adsorption, intermediate steps, and desorption. This work provides a novel and environmentally friendly strategy for constructing energy-efficient and highly efficient catalysts through the doping of alkaline earth metals.

AB Starch high biodegradation is a limitation for commercialization of starch derived slow release fertilizers (SRFs). To reduce starch biodegradation, kraft lignin (5%-20%) was tested for reducing the starch biodegradability in urea crosslinked starch (UcS) films, reported as here as a SRF. Biodegradability tests were conducted under anaerobic soil microcosm for period of 60 days. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy results showed an absence of peak at 1776 cm(-1) (pertained to oxidation of starch) in biodegraded lignin reinforced films. Thermogravimetric analysis of lignin reinforced films showed deceleration in the biodegradability rates, which were clearly evident from increase in the decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss, similar to 67.0 degrees C and at maximum weight loss, similar to 13.6 degrees C. Besides, char contents were increased, similar to 11.3%. Molecular weight distribution indicated the lignin's effect on conservation the molecular weight and polydispersity of starch in films. Lignin role in protecting the starch morphology was confirmed through optical microscopy results, which showed a less change for feret mean and particle area of starch particles. Further, lignin increased average roughness, similar to 1.04 to 4.76 times for biodegraded films, possibly due to accumulation of lignin after loss of starch in films. Further, this study concluded that lignin influenced effectively the reduction in starch biodegradability under anaerobic soil microcosm. Thus, lignin could be used in urea crosslinked starch and other similar films, for controlling the starch biodegradability and improving the SRF formulations.

TI Toluene combustion on MnOx, CeO2, and Mn-Ce-O
   solids prepared via citrate complexation, and citrate and urea
   combustion methods
SO JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH
AB MnOx, CeO2, and MnCe-O (Mn/Ce = 1) solids have been prepared via the citrate complexation and combustion method using citrate and urea precursors. The solids have been characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, N-2-adsorption-desorption, UV-Vis spectroscopy, TPR, O-2-TPD, and XPS techniques. The catalytic reactivity of the manganese oxides was not affected by the preparation protocol. In the case of ceria and mixed oxides, the synthesis method greatly affected the structural and chemical properties, ultimately altering their reactivity. The citrate complexation method produced the most homogeneous and active mixed oxide, whereas the urea combustion method resulted in less active solids. The mixed oxide prepared via urea combustion was less active than the manganese single oxide; the decrease in activity was attributed to phase separation and the formation of Mn3O4 domains on the surface of ceria. In contrast, citrate complexation resulted in solids with the lowest particle size (similar to 3 nm), the highest oxidation state for manganese, and the highest proportion of oxygen vacancies, which promote the oxidation reaction.

TI A three-dimensional nanostructure of NiFe(OH)X
   nanoparticles/nickel foam as an efficient electrocatalyst for urea
   oxidation
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Developing high-performance electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can not only solve the problem of environmental pollution, but also solve the problem of the energy crisis by producing hydrogen for electrodes. The preparation of porous three-dimensional nanostructures as efficient electrocatalysts has become important work. Here, we developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure of NiFe(OH)(X) nanoparticles/nickel foam with a high active area by a simple electroplating method and a subsequent treatment with ferric ion solution. This structure shows much greater UOR activity than the control sample (Ni/Ni foam) with the potential of 1.395 V (vs. RHE) (with an overpotential of 1.025 V) for driving the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with 0.33 M urea. This work not only provides rapid and large-scale preparation of a three-dimensional nanostructure, but also gives a new way to design and obtain high-performance electrocatalysts.

TI Bimetallic NiCo Metal-Organic Frameworks with High Stability and
   Performance Toward Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Urea in Seawater
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an alternative anodic reaction for hydrogen generation via water splitting. The significance of UOR lies in both H-2 production and the decontamination of urea-containing wastewater. Commercial electrocatalysts in this field are generally based on noble metals and show several limitations. Bimetal-organic frameworks (BMOFs) can be excellent candidates for the replacement of noble-metal-based catalysts beacuse of their promising features, such as a tunable structure, high surface area, and abundant sites for electrocatalysis. In this study, a series of nickel-cobalt BMOFs (Ni-x-Co-y-BMOFs: x and y refer to a molar fraction of Ni and Co) were synthesized and applied as electrocatalysts in UOR. In particular, a Ni0.15Co0.85-MOF material with a structure similar to that of its parent Co-MOF, revealed exceptional electrocatalytic performance, as evidenced by low values of overpotential (1.33 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2)), TOF (0.47 s(-1)), and Tafel slope (125 mV dec(-1)). At a 40 mA cm(-2) current density, Ni0.15Co0.85-MOF also showed excellent stability during the 72 h tests. This performance of NiCo-BMOF can be assigned to the synergistic effect between Co and Ni, abundant active sites, porosity, and a tunable structure, all of which result in an increased reaction rate due to the acceleration of charge and mass transfers. Thus, the present work introduces an efficient noble-metal-free UOR for energy generation from urea-based wastewater.

TI Simultaneous removal of Hg<SUP>0</SUP> and SO2 from flue gas
   using vacuum ultraviolet radiation combining with absorption of urea
   solution
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
AB A novel process on simultaneous removal of SO2 and Hg-0 from flue gas using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation combining with absorption of urea solution was developed. Several process parameters (e.g., VUV radiated power, O-2 content, solution pH, solution temperature, SO2 content, liquid-gas ratio, urea concentration and Hg-0 content) of He removal process were studied and optimized in a semicontinuous and small-scale photochemical reactor. Products and intermediates of SO2 and Hg-0 simultaneous removal were measured. Chemistry of Hg-0 removal was also investigated initially. Results show that an increase in VUV radiated power, O-2 content or liquid-gas ratio promotes He removal. Increasing solution temperature, SO2 content or Hg-0 content reduces Hg removal efficiency. Increasing solution pH or urea concentration has a dual impact on Hg-0 removal. SO2 reaches 100% removal efficiency under all test conditions. The highest simultaneous removal efficiency is 100% for SO2 and 98.1% for Hg. Hg2+ and SO42- are the final products of Hg and SO2 oxidation, respectively. Ozone and hydroxyl free radicals are successfully captured. The ozone, oxygen atom and hydroxyl free radicals are proved to be the most important oxidants for oxidation removal of Hg-0.

TI Synthesis of a novel superabsorbent with slow-release urea fertilizer
   using modified cellulose as a grafting agent and flexible copolymer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB In this work, a number of glucose unites in polymeric structure of cellulose was converted to 2,4-dihydroxy-3-(1-hydroxy-2-oxoethoxy)butanal (cellulose containing di aldehyde units (CCDAUs)) by oxidation with sodium periodate, followed by condensation with acetone to produce 5,7-dihydroxy-6-((1-hydroxy-4-oxopent-2-en-1-yl)oxy)hept-3-en-2-one unites (cellulose containing di ene units (CCDEUs)). This modified cellulose was characterized by different methods and applied as a copolymer and grafting agent to synthesize an eco-friendly (CCDEUs-g-poly(AA)/urea) superabsorbent with slow-release urea fertilizer. The created double bonds in C-2 and C-3 positions of beta-D-glucose units increased the linkage between cellulose and acrylic acid, leading to the formation of a strong network for slow-release urea fertilizer. Also, this modification created an expanded network for storage a high amount of water by increasing the cellulose flexibility. The reaction conditions for modification and synthesis of the superabsorbent, the oxidation degree value of glucose units, kinetics models, the effect of different saline solutions, various pH and reswelling time on the water absorbency, water retention capacity, reusability, biodegradability, and slow-release property were investigated. Also, the effect of synthesized CCDEUs-g-poly(AA)/urea on plant growth was tested and excellent results were obtained. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Remarkable COx tolerance of Ni<SUP>3+</SUP> active
   species in a Ni2O3 catalyst for sustained
   electrochemical urea oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) provides a cost-effective way of generating hydrogen owing to its low thermodynamic energy barrier. Although the UOR is an effective way to generate hydrogen, sustained activity and long-term catalyst usage are retarded by COx poisoning. In nickel oxide-based UOR electrocatalysts, enhancing Ni3+ active species (NiO(OH)) is one of the effective ways to improve the activity. In this study, we show that Ni2O3 is a promising UOR catalyst with Ni3+ ions being highly active and the UOR activity is seen to be almost six times higher than that of NiO. Ni2O3 shows retention of 70% UOR performance even after 25 hours at an average current density of 25 mA cm(-2), whereas the NiO system loses 50% of its activity within 10 h even at a low current density of 5.1 mA cm(-2). The efficient and sustained UOR activity of Ni2O3 can be correlated with the highly tolerant Ni3+ ions in the Ni2O3 system towards COx poisoning compared to the tolerance of NiO, as proved by impedance studies. The impedance spectra acquired at various applied potentials in the UOR regime show a highly significant reverse loop (real impedance is negative) for NiO indicative of impeding COx desorption as a rate-determining step in the 0.48 to 0.52 V potential window, whereas for Ni2O3, it is less influential under the same conditions indicating the better tolerance of Ni2O3 towards COx poisoning. Furthermore, this is reflected in the fast electro-oxidation kinetics of Ni2O3 with a lower Tafel slope value (21 mV dec(-1)) than NiO (104 mV dec(-1)). The higher COx tolerance of the Ni2O3 catalyst is the main reason behind the remarkable stability of the catalyst. Theoretical modeling supports the high activity of Ni2O3 through effective adsorption of reactants such as urea and hydroxide with feasible CO2 removal on the Ni2O3 surface.

TI One-Step Ni-Co Alloy Nanoparticles Electrodeposition from Leach Liquor
   of Spent Ni-MH Batteries Using a Deep Eutectic Solvent and Its Use
   Towards Urea Electrooxidation
SO ELECTROCATALYSIS
AB This work reports a simple, low-cost, and environmentally friendly method to synthesize Ni-Co alloy nanoparticles (Ni-CoNPs) onto a glassy carbon electrode, GCE, and its use towards the efficient urea electrooxidation in basic aqueous media. Ni-CoNPs were directly electrodeposited onto the GCE surface, GCE/Ni-CoNPs by a single potentiostatic step, from the leached liquor of the cathode powder of spent Ni-MH batteries using the reline deep eutectic solvent, DES, as leaching agent, and electrolytic bath. The GCE/Ni-CoNPs were immersed in a 1 M KOH, 0.33 M urea aqueous solution and used as anode for urea electrochemical oxidation. The mass activity of this electrode depicted a maximum value of 27,900 mAmg-1 cm-2 at ca 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a steady state mass activity of 1690 mAmg-1 cm-2 during the potentiodynamic and potentiostatic evaluation. The performance of the GCE/Ni-CoNPs electrode reported in this work is similar or better than other electrodes reported for this purpose using more sophisticated, time-consuming, and costly methods.

TI The Physiological and Pathological Role of Acyl-CoA Oxidation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Fatty acid metabolism, including beta-oxidation (beta OX), plays an important role in human physiology and pathology. beta OX is an essential process in the energy metabolism of most human cells. Moreover, beta OX is also the source of acetyl-CoA, the substrate for (a) ketone bodies synthesis, (b) cholesterol synthesis, (c) phase II detoxication, (d) protein acetylation, and (d) the synthesis of many other compounds, including N-acetylglutamate-an important regulator of urea synthesis. This review describes the current knowledge on the importance of the mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta OX in various organs, including the liver, heart, kidney, lung, gastrointestinal tract, peripheral white blood cells, and other cells. In addition, the diseases associated with a disturbance of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in the liver, heart, kidney, lung, alimentary tract, and other organs or cells are presented. Special attention was paid to abnormalities of FAO in cancer cells and the diseases caused by mutations in gene-encoding enzymes involved in FAO. Finally, issues related to alpha- and omega- fatty acid oxidation are discussed.

SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB Developing low-cost and highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) electrocatalysts is critically important for hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting. Herein, ultrasmall NiFe-LDH NCs anchored with high density on the surface of graphene oxide (NiFe NCs/GO) were prepared via an ultrafast (5 s) one-step preparation method. The obtained NiFe NCs/GO exhibited exceptional activity for OER and UOR with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 231 mV and 130 mV, respectively, in basic conditions due to the high inherent catalytic activity of NiFe LDH and the strong coupled interface between the NiFe-LDH NCs and GO substrate. Our work may provide a new ultrafast avenue for preparing highly efficient OER and UOR catalysts.

TI Evaluation of selected medicinal plant materials and dicyandiamide on
   nitrification of urea-derived ammonium under laboratory conditions
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE
AB Background: Poor utilization of urea fertilizer and N losses from agriculture lands demands alternate fertilization practices to reduce N losses and improve utilization, i.e., application of nitrification inhibitors.
   Aims: This study was aimed to evaluate and compare the influence of dicyandiamide (DCD) and selected medicinal plant materials and on N transformations, nitrification inhibition and recovery of applied N.
   Methods: Treatments included: urea nitrogen (UN), UN + DCD, UN + Gingiber officinale, UN + Viola odorata, UN + Sewertia chirata, UN + Azadirachta indica, UN + Sphaenathus indicus, UN + Allium sativus, UN + Artemisia absenthium, UN + Fumaria indicus, UN + Caesalpinea bondusella, UN + Barberis lyceum, and an un-amended control. Urea was applied at 200 mg N kg(-1) soil, while DCD and medicinal plant materials were applied at of 1% and 20% of applied urea, respectively.
   Results: Medicinal plant materials inhibited nitrification of urea-derived NH4 + - N. On an average of medicinal plant materials treatments, 51% of NH4 + - N was still present in soil compared to 17% NH4 + - N in UN treatment without medicinal plant materials after 28 days. Similarly, NO3 - - N was 76.54 mg kg(-1) in UN treatment compared to 34.40 mg kg(-1) in UN + medicinal plant materials treatments, indicating 55% reduction in nitrification. Apparent nitrogen recovery (ANR) in UN treatment was 65% compared to 74% in UN + DCD treatment. ANR in treatments, where UN was amended with medicinal plant materials, varied between 58 to 70%.
   Conclusions: The use of DCD and medicinal plant materials with UN significantly reduced NH4 + - N oxidation and nitrification ( NO3 - - N). In general, medicinal plant materials were more effective in regulating N transformations and, thus, offer a suitable alternate fertilization practice to reduce N losses and improve fertilizer utilization.

TI Solar-assisted urea oxidation at silicon photoanodes promoted by an
   amorphous and optically adaptive Ni-Mo-O catalytic layer
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Enabling Si to perform solar photoelectrocatalysis is a tedious task due to its low stability and because it requires interfacial catalytic layers that can impede light absorption. Here, we report the deposition of amorphous Ni-Mo-O (NMO) coatings onto metal-insulator-semiconductor silicon junctions and we use these surfaces as photoanodes for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The novelty is that these photoanodes stand out for two reasons. First, they allow unprecedented performance for photoelectrochemical UOR at silicon at low overpotentials: photovoltage of 400 mV, onset potential of 0.9 V vs. RHE, activity for hours, high faradaic and photoconversion efficiencies. Second, the deposited NMO coating exhibits an optically adaptive nature, that promotes considerable improvement of the maximum photocurrent in the presence of urea. This original behavior is promising for the future development of original photoelectrode architectures.

TI Enhanced adsorption and removal of urea from aqueous solutions using
   eco-friendly iron phosphate nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB This work reports of using iron phosphate nanoparticles (nano-FePh) as adsorbent for removing urea. Hence, the adsorption of urea on nano-FePh was investigated as a function of reaction time, temperature, catalyst weight, shaking speed and solution pH. Amorphous iron phosphate is synthesized by a cost-effective method reflux. The nano-FePh is characterized by different techniques including; X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron micrograph (TEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), FT-IR and BET surface area determination. Highest adsorption extent obtained at pH range of 7-9 with uptake of urea equals to 1.2 x 10(2) mg/g (gram of nano-FePh). The reaction kinetics of the adsorption of urea follows a pseudo-first-order model. Application of homogenous film diffusion model and matrix diffusion model is carried out and analyzed. The model of the diffusion liquid film controls the process at the first adsorption step and then at the final stage is under control by matrix diffusion model. Frumkin adsorption isotherm is found to fit with the experimental data. The kinetics and thermodynamic parameters have been determined and analyzed. The nano-FePh adsorbent was stable and the adsorption capacity was remaining excellent after 10 cycles.

TI Urea Amendment Decreases Microbial Diversity and Selects for Specific
   Nitrifying Strains in Eight Contrasting Agricultural Soils
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers, predominantly as urea, is a major source of reactive N in the environment, with wide ranging effects including increased greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere and aquatic eutrophication. The soil microbial community is the principal driver of soil N cycling; thus, improved understanding of microbial community responses to urea addition has widespread implications. We used next-generation amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize bacterial and archaeal communities in eight contrasting agricultural soil types amended with 0, 100, or 500 mu g N g(-1) of urea and incubated for 21 days. We hypothesized that urea amendment would have common, direct effects on the abundance and diversity of members of the microbial community associated with nitrification, across all soils, and would further affect the broader heterotrophic community resulting in decreased diversity and variation in abundances of specific taxa. Significant (P < 0.001) differences in bacterial community diversity and composition were observed by site, but amendment with only the greatest urea concentration significantly decreased Shannon indices. Expansion in the abundances of members of the families Microbacteriaceae, Chitinophagaceae, Comamonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, and Nitrosomonadaceae were also consistently observed among all soils (linear discriminant analysis score >= 3.0). Analysis of nitrifier genera revealed diverse, soil-specific distributions of oligotypes (strains), but few were correlated with nitrification gene abundances that were reported in a previous study. Our results suggest that the majority of the bacterial and archaeal community are likely unassociated with N cycling, but are significantly negatively impacted by urea application. Furthermore, these results reveal that amendment with high concentrations of urea may reduce nitrifier diversity, favoring specific strains, specifically those within the nitrifying genera Nitrobacter, Nitrospira, and Nitrosospira, that may play significant roles related to N cycling in soils receiving intensive urea inputs.

TI Enabling the full exposure of Fe2P@NixP
   heterostructures in tree-branch-like nanoarrays for promoted urea
   electrolysis at high current densities
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB It's highly desirable but still challenging, through the structure construction strategy, to design brilliant bifunctional electrocatalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with both fast electron and mass transport, especially under high current densities. Herein, a novel tree-branch-like Fe2P@NixP heterostructure nanoarrays on NF (denoted as Fe2P@NixP/NF) were fabricated as bifunctional catalysts to realize urea-rich-water electrolysis at large current density. Benefiting from the tree-branch-like hierarchical architectures with rich exposed heterointerfaces between Fe2P and NixP that can simultaneously achieve facilitated mass and electron transfer, the elaborated Fe2P@NixP/NF electrode shows brilliant electrocatalytic UOR and HER performance. The assembled Fe2P@NixP/NF I Fe2P@NixP/NF couple could yield the current density of as high as 500 mA cm(-2) at super low cell voltage of 1.604 V for urea electrolysis. We believe our work can chart a brand-new-path in developing an industrial electrolyzer to promise an energy-saving H-2 generation along with urea-rich wastewater treatment.

TI In situ growth of single-layered -Ni(OH)2 nanosheets
   on a carbon cloth for highly efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of
   urea
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is useful for the simultaneous elimination of urea-rich wastewater and generation of hydrogen. In theory, nickel-based catalysts, as non-precious metal catalysts, show great advantages in this regard. However, poor conductivity and insufficient active sites on common nickel-based nanomaterials hinder their catalytic performance. Herein, we report methanol-directed one-step growth of single-layered (SL) -Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets on a conductive carbon cloth (CC) (SL -Ni(OH)(2) NS/CC) for highly efficient electrocatalytic urea oxidation. Without the use of any other pretreatment and modification methodology, it is found that huge SL -Ni(OH)(2) NS with a thickness of approximate to 0.8 nm densely and fully covers every CC fiber in the form of nanowalls. Taking advantage of the good conductivity of CC and the sufficiently exposed active surface of SL -Ni(OH)(2) NS, the resulting SL -Ni(OH)(2) NS/CC-integrated electrode displays superior UOR performance. A current density as high as 436.4 mA cm(-2) at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl is achieved, which represents the best UOR performance among those of the reported nickel-based electrocatalysts. This convenient approach opens a new way to obtain ultrafine heterogeneous catalysts and their integrated electrodes with the assistance of methanol solvent instead of water.

TI Modulation of Urea Transport Attenuates TLR2-Mediated Microglial
   Activation and Upregulates Microglial Metabolism In Vitro
SO METABOLITES
AB Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder traditionally characterised by the presence of amyloid beta (A beta) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles in the brain. However, emerging research has highlighted additional metabolic hallmarks of AD pathology. These include the metabolic reprogramming of microglia in favour of glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation. This shift is attributed to an 'M1 '-like pro-inflammatory phenotype, which exacerbates neuroinflammation and contributes to neuronal damage. The urea cycle also presents as an altered metabolic pathway in AD, due to elevated urea levels and altered expression of urea cycle enzymes, metabolites, and transporters in the brain. However, to date, these changes remain largely unexplored. Methods: This study focuses on understanding the effects of extracellular urea and urea transporter-B (UT-B) inhibition on inflammatory changes in lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-stimulated BV2 microglia and on the viability of SH-SY5Y neuronal cells under oxidative stress and neurotoxic conditions. Results: In BV2 microglia, UT-B inhibition demonstrated a notable anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and the expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and CCL2 in response to stimulation with the toll-like receptor (TLR)2 agonist, lipoteichoic acid (LTA). This was accompanied by a reduction in extracellular urea and upregulation of UT-B expression. The application of exogenous urea was also shown to mediate the inflammatory profile of BV2 cells in a similar manner but had only a modest impact on UT-B expression. While exposure to LTA alone did not alter the microglial metabolic profile, inhibition of UT-B upregulated the expression of genes associated with both glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Conversely, neither increased extracellular urea nor UT-B inhibition had a significant impact on cell viability or cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neurones exposed to oxidative stressors tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Conclusions: This study further highlights the involvement of urea transport in regulating the neuroinflammation associated with AD. Moreover, we reveal a novel role for UT-B in maintaining microglial metabolic homeostasis. Taken together, these findings contribute supporting evidence to the regulation of UT-B as a therapeutic target for intervention into neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease.

TI Constructing NiO/Co3O4/KNbO3
   heterostructure with NiO and Co3O4 particles
   coupled on KNbO3 cubes for high-performance urea-assisted
   alkaline oxygen evolution reaction
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB In this study, a novel NiO/Co3O4/KNbO3 heterostructured electrocatalyst with NiO and Co3O4 particles coupled on KNbO3 cubes was constructed using simple sol-gel and calcination processes. The formation of multiple interfaces between NiO, Co3O4, and KNbO3 in the heterostructure contributed to a synergistic effect, adjusted the electronic structure, and generated abundant active sites at the interfaces. As a result, the NiO/Co3O4/KNbO3 electrocatalyst exhibited remarkable urea electrolysis performance, including a low potential of 1.67 V at 100 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 29 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the change in the overpotential was negligible even after a rigorous stability test of 3000 cycles, highlighting its exceptional durability and reliability. This study provides a novel structural engineering strategy for achieving efficient hydrogen production and purification from urea-containing wastewater.

TI N-induced compressive strain in Ni-MoO2 heterostructure with micro-nano
   array for improving high-current-output urea-assisted water electrolysis
   performance
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Developing high-performance catalysts is significant for hydrogen production from urea electrolysis, but is still an enormous challenge. Herein, we construct an N-induced compressive strain of Ni-MoO2 heterostructure with a micro-nano array structure supported on nickel foam (N-Ni-MoO2/NF) to dramatically boost the urea electrolysis performance. In 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M urea condition, N-Ni-MoO2/NF shows low potentials for urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction (UOR: E10/500/1000 = 1.351/1.415/1.439 V; HER: E- 10/-500/- 1000 = -49/-242/-284 mV). Furthermore, it can obtain 1.753 V at the high-current-output of 500 mA cm-2 for urea electrolysis and stably operate for 100 h. The good UOR/HER activity and stability of N-Ni-MoO2/NF are owing to the triaxial compressive strain of Ni and MoO2, and the heterostructure between Ni and MoO2, which tune the electronic structure of N-Ni-MoO2/NF and optimize the adsorption/desorption energy of hydrogen/urea species. Besides, the micro-nano array structure accelerates the diffusion of gas/liquid and affords more active sites to improve UOR/HER performance. Therefore, this work not only fabricates a good catalyst for urea electrolysis but also provides a promising avenue for designing high-performance non-precious-metal catalytic materials at high -current-output.

TI Modulating effect of urea/melamine on Co2+/Co3+ratio of Co3O4
   microplates for rapid hydrogen generation via NaBH4 hydrolysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The oxidation state of an active metal is vital in the hydrolysis of NaBH4 for rapid hydrogen generation since the electron-rich and electron-deficient sites facilitate BH4- and H2O adsorption. Herein, we systematically design a tunable oxidation state of Co in Co3O4 by in situ N-doing using the combination of melamine (M) and urea (U) as nitrogen precursors during thermal treatment. The oxidation state of Co was tuned via electronic interaction between N and Co. This interaction was optimized by varying the amount of N doping and calcination temperature. The types of heterocyclic nitrogen, mainly pyridinic- and graphitic-N, and their carbon matrix content are critical in controlling the Co oxidation state. Various Co2+/Co3+ ratios showed a different catalytic performance, and the catalytic activity reached its peak at the highest ratio of 2.74 due to the synergetic effect of the maximum adsorption of BH4- and H2O by Co2+ and Co3+, respectively. Consequently, an excellent hydrogen generation rate (2042 mL g-1 min-1) was achieved with a low activation energy of 46.9 kJ mol- 1 of M2.5U10Co3O4-400. Hence, N doping from a dual N source significantly enhanced the hydrogen performance compared to the reported cobalt-based catalyst. Furthermore, M2.5U10Co3O4-400 is highly recyclable, implying its stability and practical application.

TI Unconventional Phase Synergies with Doping Engineering Over Ni
   Electrocatalyst Featuring Regulated Electronic State for Accelerated
   Urea Oxidation
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Exploring high-performing Ni-based electrocatalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is crucial for developing urea-related energy technologies yet remains a daunting challenge. In this study, a synergistic anomalous hcp phase and heteroatom doping engineering over metallic Ni are found to enhance the UOR. A metal-organic framework-mediated approach is proposed to construct Ni nanoparticles (NPs) with designated crystal phase embedded in N-doped carbon (fcc-Ni/NC and hcp-Ni/NC). Significant crystal phase-dependent catalytic activity for the UOR is observed; hcp-Ni/NC, featuring unusual hcp phase, outperforms fcc-Ni/NC with conventional fcc phase. Moreover, incorporating foreign Mn species in hcp-Ni/NC can further dramatically promote UOR, making it among the best UOR catalysts reported to date. From experimental results and DFT calculations, the specific nanoarchitecture, involving an anomalous hcp phase together with Mn doping engineering, endows hcp-MnNi/NC with abundant exposed active sites, facile charge transfer, and more significantly, optimized electronic state, giving rise to enriched Ni3+ active species and oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface during electrocatalysis. These features collectively contribute to the enhanced UOR activity. This work highlights a potent design strategy to develop advanced catalysts with regulated electronic state through synergistic crystal phase and doping engineering.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Fabrication of earth-abundant, environmentally friendly, high-efficiency and robust bifunctional elec-trodes for generating hydrogen has become increasingly appealing. Herein, a series of MnS/ZnS nano -hybrids grown directly on Ni foams was firstly explored at different temperatures by one-step hydrothermal method for water and urea electrolysis. When it was used as the hydrogen evolution re-action and oxygen evolution reactions catalyst, MZS/NF-180 demonstrates a small overpotentials of 223 mV and 357 mV at a considerable current density of 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, adapting it as cathode and anode electrode for water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, a low cell voltage of 1.61 Vis required for delivering 10 mA cm(-2) and cycling lifespan is attained for more than 12 h. Additionally, the elec-trochemical urea oxidation results demonstrates that MZS/NF-180 demands just cell voltage of 1.37 V (vs RHE) to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. And urea-assisted electrolysis cell displayed a low potential of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a good stability for a 12 h test. Besides, the theoretical cal-culations are also conducted to explore the detail of electrocatalyst activity in water splitting. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Environmental performance assessment of the melamine-urea-formaldehyde
   (MUF) resin manufacture: a case study in Brazil
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) resin is commonly used in the production of wood-based panels. It can replace urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin particularly to improve wood panel properties under high humidity conditions. This paper presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) study of the production of MUF resin through a case study conducted in Brazil. The assessment of 1 kg of MUF resin included two main stages: raw material supply and MUF resin manufacturing. A detailed inventory of MUF resin was obtained from technical visits to a Brazilian producer (foreground system), as well as from literature reviews (mainly background systems). The potential environmental impact assessment phase was assessed by applying two methods and seven impact categories: CML (abiotic depletion, acidification, global warming, eutrophication and photochemical oxidation) and USEtox (ecotoxicity and human toxicity). The raw material supply stage was responsible for most of the impacts, except for the toxicological impact categories. Nearly all of the raw material supply hotspots are related to the production of melamine (9-61% of impacts) and urea (3-72% of impacts). The MUF manufacturing stage was significantly more important for ecotoxicity (84% of impacts) and human toxicity (72% of impacts) due to local formaldehyde emissions. Improvement scenarios were developed and the addition of up to 10% of melamine was suggested for the production of MUF resins. MUF resin was compared with UF resin and the results showed that MUF can replace UF resin because of its lower contribution to photochemical oxidation, ecotoxicity and human toxicity.

TI Advances in Phosphorus-Based Catalysts for Urea Electrooxidation: A
   Pathway to Sustainable Waste to Energy Conversion Through
   Electrocatalysis
SO CATALYSTS
AB The electrocatalytic oxidation of urea has gained significant attention as a promising pathway for sustainable energy conversion and wastewater treatment that could address the dual goals of waste remediation and renewable energy generation. Phosphorous function groups-based catalysts have been introduced as potential electrode materials for enhancing the urea electrocatalytic oxidation reaction (UEOR) due to their unique structural properties, high stability, and tunable electronic characteristics. This review presents recent advancements in phosphorous-based catalysts (phosphates/phosphides) for UEOR. It highlights the development of novel phosphorous materials, synthesis approaches, and electrocatalytic insights into urea electrooxidation on phosphorous-based materials surfaces. Key topics include the role of different metal phosphates, surface modifications, and compositional optimizations to improve electrocatalytic efficiency and durability.

TI Revealing the Reactant Mediation Role of Low-Valence Mo for Accelerated
   Urea-Assisted Water Splitting
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Construction of bifunctional catalysts with balanced adsorption toward multiple reactants and intermediates is crucial for efficient urea-assisted water splitting. Nickel Sulfide (NiS) is considered as a promising choice for both urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), whereas the highly occupied d orbital of Ni sites results in too weak reactant adsorption to achieve satisfactory bifunctionality. Herein, considering the adsorption-energy scaling limitations, another Mo4+ site with empty d orbital is introduced into NiS crumpled nanoflowers as a reactant mediator for accelerated urea electrolysis. Based on the in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, a dual-center catalytic mechanism is proposed that the Mo4+ sites govern the reactant adsorption, subsequently cooperate with nearby Ni sites to promote the reactant dissociation, intermediate formation, and product desorption. The crumpled flower-like nanostructure also provides abundant active sites and rapid mass transfer. Consequently, the Mo-NiS exhibits excellent UOR/HER bifunctionality in an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) flow electrolyzer. Compared with the pure-water electrolysis system, the urea-assisted water electrolyzer saves 15% energy to produce hydrogen. Besides, this electrolyzer obtains an ampere-level current density of 1 A cm(-2) at the cell voltage of 2.0 V, about 2.56 times higher than that of the assembly of RuO2||Pt/C, and robust durability.

TI Self-Encapsulated Ni Nanoparticles on Delignified Wood Carbon for
   Efficient Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Production
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Developing efficient, low-cost electrocatalysts for industrial-level hydrogen production remains a significant challenge. Here lattice-distorted Ni nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated within a nitrogen-doped carbon shell on delignified wood carbon (Ni-NC@DWC) are constructed through a chitosan-induced assembly and the pyrolysis process. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the lattice distortion due to strong metal-support interactions, boosts electron transfer and reaction intermediate adsorption/desorption, enhancing both the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Interestingly, the active center Ni3+-O is dynamically cyclically generated during the UOR. When utilized as a self-standing electrode in an alkaline electrolyte, the Ni-NC@DWC exhibits low potentials of 24 mV and 1.244 V at 100 mA cm(-2) for HER and UOR, respectively. Moreover, the Ni-NC@DWC achieves an ultrasmall cell voltage of 1.13 V at 100 mA cm(-2) for urea-assisted water splitting and can operate stably over 1000 h. Furthermore, when it is self-assembled as an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, it requires only 1.62 V at 2000 mA cm(-2) for industrial urea-assisted water splitting and operates stably for 150 h without degradation, confirming that it is highly attractive for economical, sustainable, and scalable hydrogen production.

TI Influence of amine chain extenders on morphology and performances of
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) based poly(urea-urethane) elastomers
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE
AB The structure, morphology, and performance of polyurethanes are greatly influenced by the structure of chain extenders. In this study, two types of amine chain extenders, 1,3-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (BAPD) and isophorone diamine (IPDA), were utilized in the synthesis of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based poly(urea-urethane) elastomers (PDMS-PUUs). The mechanical properties, morphology, and in vitro oxidative stability of the as-prepared elastomers were controlled by altering the ratio of BAPD and IPDA. The results indicate that the overall phase mixing of PDMS-PUUs improves after incorporating of BAPD into the hard segments. The hard segment, composed of IPDA with a rigid structure, plays a crucial role in maintaining the essential mechanical properties of the PDMS-PUUs. Furthermore, PDMS-PUUs based on mixed chain extenders exhibit relatively high boundary diffuseness and boundary thickness. Especially, the PDMS-PUU sample synthesized from BAPD and IPDA with a molar ratio of 1/1 features the highest boundary diffuseness (0.094) and boundary thickness (0.395 nm), consequently displaying some remarkable properties, including enhanced cyclic tensile properties, superior strain recovery (92.6%), a low modulus (8.6 MPa), and high tensile strength (20.3 MPa). PDMS-PUUs also exhibit good oxidative stability and biocompatibility, implying that the as-prepared PDMS-PUUs are proven to be biostable and capable of long-term implantation.

TI A novel process for removal of Hg<SUP>0</SUP> from flue gas using
   urea/persulfate activated by high temperature in a spray reactor
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN
AB Urea-based wet flue gas desulfurization (Urea-WFGD) is a promising technology because of its simple process, high desulfurization efficiency, and recyclability of the products. However, it cannot effectively remove Hg-0 from flue gas because of the low solubility of Hg-0 in water. In this study, enhancement of the removal of Hg-0 from flue gas in a urea-WFGD system using high-temperature-activated (NH4)(2)S2O8 was investigated for the first time in a spray reactor. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of process parameters on Hg-0 removal. Reaction products and key radicals were detected. The reaction mechanism and pathways were also revealed. Removal of Hg-0 in urea-WFGD system was significantly enhanced by high-temperature-activated (NH4)(2)S2O8. The mechanism behind this effect is that an increase of reaction temperature significantly increases the concentration of (NH4)(2)S2O8 or liquid-gas ratio, thereby increasing Hg-0 removal efficiency. However, an increase of solution pH or urea concentration significantly decreases the removal efficiency. Changing Hg-0 or SO2 concentration has only a small effect on Hg-0 removal. NH4+, SO42-, NO3-, and Hg2+ are found in solution, and S2O82-/OH/SO4- oxidations play an important role in the removal of Hg-0. The results demonstrate that the feasibility of Hg-0 removal in urea-WFGD system was enhanced by high-temperature-activated (NH4)(2)S2O8 in a spray reactor.

TI Functional Nickel Oxide Nanostructures for Ethanol Oxidation in Alkaline
   Media
SO ELECTROANALYSIS
AB Nickel oxide (NiO) nanostructures are employed in the basic medium for the oxidation of ethanol. A variety of NiO nanostructures are synthesized by wet chemical growth method, using different hydroxide (OH-) ion sources, particularly from ammonia, hexamethylenetetramine, urea and sodium hydroxide. The use of urea as (OH-) ion source results in flower-like NiO structures composed by extremely thin nanowalls (thickness lower than 10 nm,), which demonstrated to be the most active for ethanol oxidation. All the samples exhibit NiO cubic phase, and no other impurity was detected. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of NiO nanostructures were found linear over the concentration range 0.1-3.5 mM (R-2=0.99) of ethanol, with the limit of detection estimated to be 0.013 mM for ethanol. The NiO nanostructures exhibit a selective signal towards ethanol oxidation in the presence of different members of alcohol family. The proposed NiO nanostructures showed a significant practicality for the reproducible and sensitive determination of ethanol from brandy, whisky, mixture of brandy and rum, and vodka samples. The nanomaterial was used as a surface modifying agent for the glassy carbon electrode and it showed a stable electro-oxidation activity for the ethanol for 16 days. These findings indicate that the presented NiO nanomaterial can be applied in place of noble metals for ethanol sensing and other environmental applications (like fuel cells).

TI Concurrent Deposition and Exfoliation of Nickel Hydroxide Nanoflakes
   Using Liquid Crystal Template and Their Activity for Urea
   Electrooxidation in Alkaline Medium
SO ELECTROCATALYSIS
AB Nickel hydroxide nanoflakes (Ni(OH)(2)-NF) were prepared by chemical deposition and in situ exfoliation of nickel hydroxide layers confined in the aqueous domain of the liquid crystalline hexagonal template of BrijA (R) 78 surfactant. Using excess of sodium borohydride as a reducing agent generates concurrent excessive dynamic hydrogen bubbles which exfoliated and fragmented the nickel hydroxide layers precipitated within the soft hexagonal template. The physicochemical characterizations of Ni(OH)(2)-NF by using surface area analyser, X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS and transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed the formation of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanoflakes with thickness of 2-3 nm and have about 450 m(2) g(-1) surface area which is 20 times higher than that for bare nickel (bare-Ni) deposited without surfactant template. The electrocatalytic activity of the Ni(OH)(2)-NF catalyst for urea electrolysis was studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques. The Ni(OH)(2)-NF has shown a superior activity for the electrochemical oxidation of urea in alkaline solution and exhibits more than tenfold increase in activity in comparison with the bare-Ni deposit. The enhancement of urea electrooxidation activity was related to the superficial enhancement in the electroactive surface area of Ni(OH)(2)-NF. This new approach of deposition and in situ exfoliation by using liquid crystal template and hydrogen bubbles offers a new platform to nanostructuring wide range of catalysts with better catalytic performance.

TI Maize Stover Biochar Accelerated Urea Hydrolysis and Short-term Nitrogen
   Turnover in Soil
SO BIORESOURCES
AB A soil incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of biochar application (2% w/w) on urea hydrolysis and inorganic nitrogen accumulation. Fresh biochars were produced from maize stover that was pyrolyzed at 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C, and 700 degrees C. Then the matured biochars were obtained via a 50 days maturing process. Biochar prepared at 700 degrees C strongly accelerated the urea hydrolysis and increased soil pH. Fresh biochar, especially when pyrolyzed at low temperature, contained a relatively high concentration of labile carbon and 43% to 64% could be oxidized within 40 days of maturing incubation. The labile carbon in fresh biochars led to microbes thriving and resulted in an accelerated short-term nitrogen (N) turnover, i.e., at an early stage of incubation, fresh biochar increased mineralization of soil organic N by 79 mg.kg(-1) to 449 mg.kg(-1). However, a reduction of soil available N contents induced by microbial immobilization effect was observed at the end of incubation. The authors concluded that aged biochar was suitable for simultaneous soil amendment with urea rather than newly produced biochar. This is because aged biochar can avoid high soil available N accumulation; thus it can decrease the risk of inorganic N leaching loss.

TI Biogenic synthesis of Mn3O4 NPs using
   Phyllanthus emblica leaf extract for electrochemical sensing of
   urea
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB Green synthesis integrates green chemistry, environmental remediation, and nanotechnology, focusing on biogenic manganese oxide nanoparticles. This method promotes advanced techniques for human health and safety by minimizing the use of chemical reagents. Herein Phyllanthus emblica leaf extract was used for producing biogenic manganese oxide nanoparticles (B-Mn3O4 NPs), which serve as a reducing, capping, and stabilizing agent in the reaction. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FTIR, UV-visible, and energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were used to investigate the structural, morphological, and spectroscopic studies of Mn3O4 NPs. These analyses confirmed the formation of a single-phase Mn3O4 tetragonal structure. The characterization results indicated that biogenic materials are heterogeneous, making them suitable candidates for electrochemical sensing of urea. This study utilizes urease enzyme to enhance the selectivity, sensitivity, and specificity of B-Mn3O4 NPs-modified electrode towards urea sensing, considering its impact on human health. The selection of the urea analyte arises from the urgent requirement to monitor environmental contamination with urea, which directly affects human health at higher concentrations. To monitor contaminated environments, this study developed ultrasensitive urea biosensors that achieved high sensitivity (2.33 mu A mu M(-1)cm(-2)) and selectivity with a low detection limit (0.0276 mu M).

TI Electrochemical non-enzymatic urea sensing using polyvinylpyrrolidine
   derived highly electrocatalytic NiCo2O4 nanowires
SO JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH
AB It is highly desirable to use non-enzymatic urea sensors in the clinical, biomedical, agricultural, and food industries. Thus, we have utilized polyvinyl-pyrrolidine (PVP) to tune the shape, particle and electrochemical properties of NiCo2O4 nanowires during hydrothermal processes. NiCo2O4 nanowires were investigated under alkaline conditions 0f 0.1 M NaOH in relation to their electrochemical activity in detecting urea using PVP. NiCo2O4 nanowires were analyzed using different analytical techniques to determine their structure, chemical composition, and crystallinity. The PVP has strongly changed the morphology of NiCo2O4 from nanorod to thin nanowires with diameter of 150 nm to 250 nm and the grain size was also reduced. A cubic phase crystal system displayed a typical spinel structure in NiCo2O4 nanowires. NiCo2O4 nanowires prepared with 50 mg of PVP show a wide linear range of urea concentrations between 1 and 16 mM with a limit of detection of 0.01 mM. In addition to this, the stability, selectivity, and reproducibility of the experiment were all satisfactory. Consequently, NiCo2O4 nanowires may perform better because they have a smaller particle size, a smaller grain size, are exposed to more catalytic sites, and have a higher electrical conductivity. The newly developed NiCo2O4 nanowire-bussed enzyme-free sensor was also examined for practicality.

We suggested a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation as a mechanistic route for the last step of the described synthesis. A simple procedure, high proficiency, and recyclability of the catalyst are the most attractive features of this protocol.

TI F-regulated Ni2P-F3 nanosheets as efficient electrocatalysts
   for full-water-splitting and urea oxidation
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Heteroatomic anion doping represents a powerful approach for manipulating the electronic configuration of the active metal locus in electrocatalysts, resulting in enhanced multifunctional electrocatalytic properties in hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). Here, fluorine-tailored Ni2P-F3 nanosheets were synthesized and evaluated as a robust multifunctional electrocatalyst for HER, OER, and UOR. Our comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the anionic F effectively tailored the electronic states of the Ni2P-F3 nanosheets, resulting in an elevated d-band center and optimizing the sorption capacity of intermediates. In addition to thermodynamically and kinetically favoured redox reactions, F doping facilitates the reconstruction and generation of active gamma-NiOOH. Resulting from the optimized electronic configuration and nanosheet architecture, outstanding catalytic activities are demonstrated by Ni2P-F3 with low overpotentials to reach 100 mA cm(-2) for HER (177 mV) and OER (293 mV), surpassing Ni2P by 234 and 205 mV, respectively. Notably, 1.618 V is required for full-water-diversion to reach 10 mA cm(-2), while 1.414 V is required with urea oxidation for 100 mA cm(-2).

TI Smart selection of fuel blends: Robust oxidation of formic acid in its
   blend with urea at NiOx/Pd nanoparticles-based binary anodes
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Enhanced oxidation of formic acid (FAO) is observed at NiOx/Pd/GC anodes in the presence of urea as a blending fuel. FAO is noticeably enhanced (in the presence of urea as a blending fuel) as demonstrated by CV measurements where a five-fold increase of the direct FAO peak (I-p(d)), and a favorable negative shift of its onset potential (E-onset) are observed. Additionally, a six-fold increase of the fuel utilization (FU), expressed in the amount of charge consumed during FAO is markedly enhanced in FA-urea fuel blend (0.3 M FA and 0.2 M urea) compared to that obtained in the absence of urea (i.e., 0.3 M FA only) at the NiOx/Pd/GC electrode. Additionally, capacitance measurements of the electrode/electrolyte interface increases in line with FAO activity. Urea molecules are thought to form a bridged H-bonding with formate anions thus facilitating a favorable adsorption geometry allowing for a facile C-H scissoring, thus promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway of FA to CO2. A plausible explanation assumes the formation of 6- and/or 8-membered rings between formate anion and urea (via hydrogen bonding). These findings emphasize the importance of the proper design of the catalyst together with the smart selection of the blending fuel with FA. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Ultrathin nickel terephthalate nanosheet three-dimensional aggregates
   with disordered layers for highly efficient overall urea electrolysis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The controlled synthesis of ultrathin metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets and the rational design of three-dimensional (3D) aggregates of these nanosheets are vital for electrochemical applications. Herein, ultrathin nickel terephthalate nanosheet 3D aggregates were synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method and employed as electrocatalysts for overall urea electrolysis. Surprisingly, the thickness of the nanosheets could be controlled by varying the synthesis time. A low-dose high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique with spherical aberration corrected TEM was utilized to visualize the crystalline structures of the ultrathin MOF nanosheets. Interestingly, similar to 5 nm thick disordered layers were observed at the edges of the ultrathin nanosheets, plausibly induced by vacancies that could not be identified with conventional TEM. The 3D aggregates of the ultrathin nanosheets with disordered layers required an ultralow potential of 1.381 V for urea oxidation with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 186 mV lower than that for the oxygen evolution reaction, and a potential of 1.52 V for overall urea electrolysis, with outstanding long-term durability. The amazing catalytic properties may be attributed to the adequate unsaturated coordination of nickel on the surface of the disordered layers, which guarantees numerous active sites; these results are consistent with the high-resolution TEM observations.

TI Interfacial electronic modification of bimetallic oxyphosphides as
   Multi-functional electrocatalyst for water splitting and urea
   electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Electrochemical water or wastewater splitting is a sustainable development approach for both hydrogen generation and pollutant elimination. Herein, an N-engineering ultrathin bimetallic oxyphosphides nanosheets on Ni foam (CoNiOP/NF) as a multi-functional binder-free electrode was synthesized for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The catalytic activity of the composites could be improved through introducing N-doping via an in-situ transformation and heterogeneous metals by ion exchange. Both theoretical calculation and experimental investigations confirmed that electrons transferred from metal centers to anion at the interface, which was favor to accelerate the phase transformation to electrochemically active species and optimize the intermediates adsorption dynamics, thus providing greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activities. Assembled an electrolyzer using UOR replaced OER, it required only 1.42 V to achieve 50 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability, 214 mV less than that required for HER parallel to OER. This work would be beneficial for the exploitation of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for simultaneous realization of energy-saving urea-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production and urea-containing wastewater purifying.

TI Platinum nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon for ammonia
   electro-oxidation
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Pt nanoparticles supported on carbon (Pt/C) and nitrogen-doped carbon (Pt/NC) were prepared by an alcohol-reduction process and used for ammonia electro-oxidation in alkaline media. Nitrogen-doped carbons were prepared by thermal treatment of urea and Carbon Vulcan XC72 at 800 degrees C under argon atmosphere. The obtained materials showed the presence of face centered cubic structure of Pt and mean particle sizes in the range of 3-3.7 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results revealed that Pt/NC 5 (carbon prepared with 5% of urea) presents more Pt on the surface than Pt/C, and the nanoparticles are predominantly in the metallic state. The electrocatalytic activity was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry experiments. Pt/NC materials showed a higher electrocatalytic activity for ammonia electro-oxidation than Pt/C, whereby the material Pt/NC 5 showed the peak current density 161% higher than Pt/C. The increase of activity might be related to the high electrochemically accessible area of Pt/NC and the improvement on the interaction with water due to the nitrogen onto the support which could contribute to the oxidation of intermediate products from ammonia electro-oxidation.

TI Green Pathway of Urea Synthesis Through Plasma-Ice Interaction:
   Optimization and Mechanistic Insights With N2 +
   CO2 and NH3 + CO2 Gas Mixtures
SO PLASMA PROCESSES AND POLYMERS
AB This study presents a green approach for urea synthesis using plasma-ice interaction with N-2+CO2 and NH3 + CO2 gas mixtures. Plasma characterization via electrical and optical emission spectroscopy revealed that urea formation involves complex reactions driven by high-energy species, producing reactive nitrogen and carbon intermediates. Plasma-treated ice exhibited increased pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and reduced oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). Optimization of parameters, especially treatment time, significantly influenced urea formation. The NH3 + CO2 plasma produced a higher urea concentration (7.7 mg L-1) compared to the N-2 + CO2 plasma (0.55 mg L-1) due to ammonia's greater reactivity. This method offers a sustainable, energy-efficient alternative to traditional urea synthesis processes.

TI Urea/nitric acid co-impregnated pitch-based activated carbon fiber for
   the effective removal of formaldehyde
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY
AB Urea/nitric acid co-impregnated pitch-based activated carbon fibers (ACFs) were examined as adsorbents for the removal of low-concentration formaldehyde gas from dry and humid atmospheres. Urea, which is a harmless and environmentally friendly primary amine, was selected as an effective reagent to capture formaldehyde and nitric acid was used to promote the oxidation of formaldehyde into formic acid, which inhibits the liberation of formaldehyde even under humid atmospheres. The optimized urea/nitric acid co-impregnated ACF showed a 110-fold (0.72 mg/g to 79.28 mg/g) improvement in its formaldehyde removal capability as compared to that of pristine ACF at 40% humidity. The formaldehyde removal mechanism is proposed based on careful analysis and quantification of the inlet and outlet gases. Further, the optimized sample facilitates complete removal of formaldehyde from ambient air at humidity of 11-88% and temperatures of 3-26.9 degrees C over 24 h, whereas only 81.5% formaldehyde removal is achieved with pristine ACF under the same conditions.

TI In vivo instability of platensimycin and platencin: Synthesis and
   biological evaluation of urea- and carbamate-platensimycin
SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN), two natural products and promising drug leads that target bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases, are known to have unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties. It is not clear, however, what the metabolic fates of PTM and PTN are and no efforts have been reported to address this key roadblock in the development of these compounds as viable drug options. Here we describe the pharmacokinetics of PTM and PTN, and reveal rapid renal clearance as the primary metabolic liability with three additional sites of chemical liability: (i) amide hydrolysis, (ii) glucuronidation, and (iii) oxidation. We determined that hydrolysis is a viable clearance mechanism in vivo and synthesized two PTM analogues to address in vivo hydrolysis. Urea-and carbamate-PTM analogues showed no detectable hydrolysis in vivo, at the expense of antibacterial activity, with no further improvement in systemic exposure. The antibacterial sulfur-containing analogues PTM D1 and PTM ML14 showed significant decreases in renal clearance. These studies set the stage for continued generation of PTM and PTN analogues in an effort to improve their pharmacokinetics while retaining or improving their biological activities.

   electrocatalyst for the water and urea oxidation
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB The clean and affordable production of green hydrogen is condicio sine qua non to endorse a carbon -neutral socioeconomic system. Complementing sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with a more ther-modynamically favored urea oxidation reaction promotes energy-saving hydrogen production and environmental remediation. In this work, carbon-incorporated ruthenium-cobalt mixed metal phos-phide was meticulously designed and synthesized via self-assembling and pyrolysis procedure with the optimal Ru doping level. A superior performance toward urea oxidation reaction and oxygen evolution reaction has been achieved: exhibiting an ultralow potential/overpotential of 1.30 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, respectively. Such mild and optimal Ru doping on the Co2P/CoP mixed phase allowed the necessary structural tuning for superior catalytic performance via modulating the electronic structure and its interaction with the adsorbed species. The rationale behind their working relationship has been developed using multimodal spec-troscopic/analytical techniques. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Piperazine-impregnated silica aerogel for direct air capture of CO2 for
   prevention of urea formation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN
AB Direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 using solid sorbents is a promising negative emission technology to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Despite many advantages of alkylamine-based adsorbents, degradation caused by urea formation under a dry CO2 regeneration remains a challenge. Herein, we hypothesized that certain nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds can contribute toward suppressing urea formation by the ring structure and thus, selected piperazine (PZ) as a representative chemical. PZ was wetimpregnated onto a silica aerogel (PZ/silica) with controlled pore size and volume. The synthesized sorbents exhibited high CO2 sorption uptake and kinetics. In a cyclic test via temperature swing adsorption (adsorption: calibrated 200 ppm CO2; desorption: dry CO2), PZ/silica exhibited stable and high adsorption capacities (average 1.3 mmol/g over 24 cycles). The suppression of urea formation in PZ/silica under extended dry CO2 regeneration was demonstrated using an in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, thereby proving the above hypothesis. PZ/silica showed good antioxidation performance of CO2 capture, 1.6 mmol CO2/g, after 12 h oxidation under 21% O2 balanced with N2. Besides, PZ/silica maintained a CO2 adsorption uptake of 0.79 mmol/g after the preliminary adsorption of H2O. This study proposes a novel way to synthesize DAC solid adsorbents using N-containing heterocyclic compounds. (c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Novel nanostructured ceria-zirconia materials were synthesized in the presence or absence of bulky cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant using an original approach combining the utilization of urea as a precipitator followed by hydrothermal treatment. The obtained materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, UV-Vis spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with hydrogen and their potential application in catalysis was studied in ethyl acetate total oxidation as a model reaction for elimination of volatile organic compounds. The results show that the presence of the bulky CTAB molecules not only does not improve notably the textural characteristics of the obtained nanomaterials but limits Ce-Zr interactions in case of mixed oxide samples and thus provides a negative effect on their catalytic performance in the studied reaction. With increasing the amount of Zr in the mixed oxide samples both Ce-Zr interactions and textural mesoporosity are enhanced and this has beneficial effect on the catalytic activity in the total oxidation of ethyl acetate.

TI Methane emission and soil microbial communities in early rice paddy as
   influenced by urea-N fertilization
SO PLANT AND SOIL
AB Background and aims Urea is widely used in rice farming systems to improve the nitrogen (N) availability and crop yield, yet its influence on CH4 emissions remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify the potential microbial mechanisms resulting in the N fertilizer-induced effects on CH4 emissions from paddies.
   Method A field experiment was conducted with (N1, 100 kg N ha(-1)) and without (N0) N fertilization. CH4 emission rate was measured every 3-7 day using the static chamber-gas chromatography method. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing approaches were employed to investigate the community composition and structure of methanogenic archaea and methanotrophic bacteria in rice rhizosphere soil at three time points (tillering stage 17d, heading stage 47d and mature stage 67 d).
   Results Urea application significantly stimulated the CH4 emissions from paddies, partially due to the decrease of redox potential (E-h) around the root region and the reduction of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration at the soil-water interface. qPCR indicated a sharp increase in methanogenic archaeal 16S rRNA and methanotrophic bacterial pmoA gene copies with urea fertilization. Next-generation sequencing of these amplicons revealed that the diversity of both methanogenic and methanotrophic communities was decreased by urea input. Additionally, urea fertilization stimulated the genera Methanoregula (methanogen) and Methylococcus (type I methanotrophs) and inhibited the genus Methylocystis (type II methanotrophs).
   Conclusions Urea fertilization changed oxygen state of the paddy soil and water and thus changed the community structure of methanogens and methanotrophs, which resulted in increased CH4 emissions.

TI Turning poison into medicine: NH3 or urea treatment leads to

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Contrary to the stereotype that exposure to NH3 or urea should be strictly avoided when preparing three-way catalysts using Pd due to Pd2+-NH3 coordination, remarkable catalytic activity improvement was realized with careful NH3 or urea treatment towards the oxides support or Pd precursor. And with the help of a newly designed facile CO temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) method, developed to replace traditional H-2-TPR, it was found that the catalytic activity is closely related with the catalyst reducibility and total oxygen storage capacity (OSC, represented by the integrated area of a CO-TPR curve), thus showing the potential of this CO-TPR method for screening candidate catalysts. When applying the most effective "Urea-PP" technology during monolith converter preparation, this method could no longer show its advantage, unless an outer layer was coated to protect the highly active but also highly sensitive inner layer.

TI P doped NiCoZn LDH growth on nickel foam as an highly efficient
   bifunctional electrocatalyst for Overall Urea-Water Electrolysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Water electrolysis is one of the important methods for hydrogen production, but the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode has a higher theoretical potential. Using urea oxidation reaction (UOR) instead of OER has been an energy-saving method because it has a lower theoretical potential and also can reduce pollution. In this paper, NiCoZn LDH/NF, P-NiCoZn LDH/NF-X (X is the atom ratio of P) = 10%, 15%, 20%) were synthesized through typically hydrothermal and calcination methods. P-NiCoZn LDH/NF-15% was demonstrated to be abifunctional electrocatalyst towards HER and UOR. When P-NiCoZn LDH/NF-15% is used as the anode and cathode for urea-water electrolysis,it shows that when the current density is 100 mA cm(-2), the voltage is 1.479 V for urea-water electrolysis, which is much better than that of IrO2/NF parallel to Pt/C/NF (1.698 V). Thus, P-NiCoZn LDH/NF-15% is expected to replace precious metals for practical applications. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Insights into mechanisms on electrochemical oxygen evolution
   substitution reactions
SO JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB The high total energy consumption of water electrolysis systems is often attributed to the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To address this issue, substituting small molecule oxidation reaction that is thermo-dynamically more advantageous for OER at the anode can significantly increase its energy conversion efficiency. Diversified oxidation substrates can ensure efficient conversion of the cathodic reaction while generating high value-added products or pollutant degradation at the anode. However, the complexity of the elemental composition of the substrate requires an in-depth study of the reaction mechanism. This review focuses on the mechanism of electrooxidation of different substrate molecules, such as ethanol, urea, and hydrazine. Additionally, it introduces some design ideas and strategies for high-performance electrocatalysts in conjunction with reaction path selectivity. The work also foresees the challenges in achieving industrial transformation in this field.

TI Accurate synergy effect of Ni-Sn dual active sites enhances
   electrocatalytic oxidation of urea for hydrogen evolution in alkaline
   medium
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB On account of its relatively low equilibrium potential, the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has promising application prospects for replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in boosting the cathode hydrogen production. To overcome the limitation of catalysts with only one active site, Ni-Sn dual sites, respectively pointing at the amino and carbonyl groups of the urea molecule, were designed based on the orbital symmetry matching principle to electrocatalytically oxidize urea at the anode for highly efficient hydrogen evolution at the cathode. The synthesized Ni-Sn sulfide catalyst, having a high active surface area (145 m(2)g(-1)), displayed outstanding performance in the UOR with a low potential of 1.36 V (vs.RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2)and achieved a high hydrogen production rate (100 L min(-1)g(cat)(-1)) at the potential of 1.69 V (vs.RHE). The density functional theory studies combined with Raman experiments unveiled that the enhanced performance is due to the weakening of the urea C-N bond, resulting from the precisely designed Ni-Sn dual active sites, and the self-driven electron transfer between Ni and Sn. The synergistic strategy of point-to-point dual active sites developed here not only achieved a highly efficient UOR to boost hydrogen production, but also provides a new concept when designing catalysts for other catalytic reactions.

TI Effects of Phosphorus on Nitrification Process in a Fertile Soil Amended
   with Urea
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB While the effects of carbon on soil nitrogen (N) cycle have been extensively studied, it is not clearly understood how co-existing macronutrients, such as phosphorus (P), affect the N cycle in agroecosystems. In this study, P amendment effects on nitrification in a fertile agricultural soil were investigated under a typical N-P amendment rate. In a laboratory incubation study, soils were amended with urea, monopotassium phosphate and a mixture of urea and monopotassium phosphate at the same rate. In soils that received no amendments (control), P only, urea only, and urea plus P amendment, nitrification occurred within the first five days, with an average net nitrification rate of 5.30, 5.77, 16.66 and 9.00 mg N kg(-1)d(-1), respectively. Interestingly, nitrification in urea-treated soils was retarded by P addition where a N:P ratio seemed to be a key factor impeding nitrification. This was also supported by the response of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), which was more sensitive to P addition than ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). The outcome of this study showed that application of P fertilizer suppressed the nitrification process in urea amended soil, suggesting that a synergistic aspect of N and P nutrient management should be further explored to retard N losses from agricultural systems.

TI Influence of Sn Content, Nanostructural Morphology, and Synthesis
   Temperature on the Electrochemical Active Area of Ni-Sn/C Nanocomposite:
   Verification of Methanol and Urea Electrooxidation
SO CATALYSTS
AB In contrast to precious metals (e.g., Pt), which possess their electro catalytic activities due to their surface electronic structure, the activity of the Ni-based electrocatalysts depends on formation of an electroactive surface area (ESA) from the oxyhydroxide layer (NiOOH). In this study, the influences of Sn content, nanostructural morphology, and synthesis temperature on the ESA of Sn-incorporated Ni/C nanostructures were studied. To investigate the effect of the nanostructural, Sn-incorporated Ni/C nanostructures, nanofibers were synthesized by electrospinning a tin chloride/nickel acetate/poly (vinyl alcohol) solution, followed by calcination under inert atmosphere at high temperatures (700, 850, and 1000 degrees C). On the other hand, the same composite was formulated in nanoparticulate form by a sol-gel procedure. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the nanofibrous morphology strongly enhanced formation of the ESA. Investigation of the tin content concluded that the optimum co-catalyst content depends on the synthesis temperature. Typically, the maximum ESA was observed at 10 and 15 wt % of the co-catalyst for the nanofibers prepared at 700 and 850 degrees C, respectively. Study of the effect of synthesis temperature concluded that at the same tin content, 850 degrees C calcination temperature reveals the best activity compared to 700 and 1000 degrees C. Practical verification was achieved by investigation of the electrocatalytic activity toward methanol and urea oxidation. The results confirmed that the activity is directly proportionate to the ESA, especially in the case of urea oxidation. Moreover, beside the distinct increase in the current density, at the optimum calcination temperature and co-catalyst content, a distinguished decrease in the onset potential of both urea and methanol oxidation was observed.

TI Reflux-based synthesis and electrocatalytic characteristics of nickel
   phosphate nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB This is a first report on the synthesis of nickel phosphate nanoparticles (N-NiPh) from its precursors using a reflux-based route at 90 degrees C and its use for destruction and conversion of urea (a biochemical species) to useful fuel (H-2 gas). The prepared particles are characterized by different techniques including: X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR spectroscopy and BET surface area determination. The particle size is found to have an average value of similar to 70 nm with surface area of 22.3 m(2)/g. According to the XRD pattern and FTIR spectrum, the obtained phase structure of the NiPh nanoparticles is Ni-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O with a monoclinic crystallographic form. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (and also EIS), the N-NiPh modified glassy carbon electrode (GC/N-NiPh) is activated upon potential cycling in 0.5 M KOH for 75 cycles. This is obtained at the maximum attainable enrichment of the N-NiPh surface by Ni(II)/Ni(III) species. The GC/N-NiPh shows superior electrocatalytic activity towards urea oxidation from alkaline solution compared to the corresponding Ni(OH)(2)-based electrodes. The oxidation process is analyzed in the light of the measured and collected electrochemical data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Ligand-induced electronic structure and morphology regulation in
   Ni3S2 heterostructures for efficient bifunctional
   electrocatalysis
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Developing highly efficient and robust transition metal-based electrocatalysts for urea and sulfion electrolysis is crucial to the development of sustainable and clean hydrogen energy, however, is still a significant challenge. Herein, we reported a one-step synthetic protocol to fabricate terephthalic acid (TPA) anchored Ni3S2 (TPA-Ni3S2) brush-shaped nanoarrays on nickel foam (NF) skeleton. The introduction of TPA ligands simultaneously regulates the charge transfer and morphology of Ni3S2, thus optimizing the adsorption strength and increasing the number of active sites, thereby improving the catalytic performance. The optimized TPA@Ni3S2/NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance toward urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a low overpotential of 1.0 V at 100 mA cm(-2) and excellent operation stability, outperforming the benchmarks and many other previous re -ported Ni-based catalysts. More excitingly, as for sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR), the TPA@Ni3S2/NF also shows excellent activity, which merely requires 0.48 V to achieve current densities of 100 mA cm(-2). Researches of the mechanism by XPS and in-situ Raman spectroscopy revealed abundant active NiOOH derivatives originated from the surface reconstruction of TPA@Ni3S2/NF, which promoted the excellent electrocatalytic performance towards UOR. In-situ DEMS isotope tracing experiments revealed the generation of N-2 was derived from urea intermolecular N-N coupling. Ex-UV-vis and in-situ UV-vis spectra further disclosed the reaction mechanism that S-2-was oxidized to short-chain polysulfides that were further combined to generate S-delta. This work provides a feasible strategy and deep understanding to design cost-efficient electrocatalysts for energy-saving hydrogen production and simultaneously eliminating wastewater pollutants.

TI Combination of Polymer-Coated Urea and Rapid-Release Urea Increases
   Grain Yield and Nitrogen Use Efficiency of Rice by Improving Root and
   Shoot Activities
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB The use of polymer-coated urea (PCU) can improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), compared to the application of rapid-release urea (RU). However, the effect of PCU-based nitrogen management on grain yield and the NUE of rice and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. A japonica rice cultivar Jinxiangyu 1 was grown in the field with four treatments including N omission (0N), split application of RU (Control), one-time application of 100% PCU (T1), and one-time application of 70% PCU + 30% RU (T2). Results showed that, compared to the control, the grain yield was significantly increased in the T2 treatment, while it was comparable in the T1 treatment. This was mainly due to increased total spikelets in the T2 treatment. Root oxidation activity (ROA) and root zeatin (Z) + zeatin riboside (ZR) content during booting were the distinct advantages of the T2 treatment, compared to either the control or T1 treatment, exhibiting significant or highly significant correlations with leaf photosynthesis. This process contributed significantly to total spikelets and total N uptake. Additionally, the T2 treatment absorbed more N than the control without reducing the internal N use efficiency (IEN), primarily due to its unchanged harvest index (HI) driven by comparable non-structural carbohydrate remobilization. In conclusion, combining PCU with RU can enhance the coordination of root and shoot traits during booting while maintaining a competitive HI at maturity, thereby significantly improving grain yield and achieving a balance in N uptake and utilization.

TI Low-Temperature Plasma-Constructed Ni-Doped W18O49
   Nanorod Arrays for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Urea
   Oxidation
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Surface engineering by doping and amorphization is receiving widespread attention from the perspective of the regulation of the electrocatalytic activities of electrocatalysts. However, the effective modulation of active sites on catalysts is still challenging. Herein, a straightforward and efficient method combining hydrothermal treatment with low-temperature plasma processing is presented to synthesize Ni-doped W18O49 nanorod arrays on carbon cloth with abundant oxygen vacancies (CC/WO-Ni-x). Mild plasma doping with Ni modifies the electronic structure of the W18O49 nanorod arrays, resulting in the formation of an amorphous structure that significantly reduces the electron transfer resistance. Additionally, the coupling with high-valent W6+ (derived from W18O49) leads to the partial preoxidation of doped Ni to form active Ni3+ species and oxygen vacancies. These features are collectively responsible for the remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) properties of CC/WO-Ni-4, for example, 10 mA cm(-2 )current density, an overpotential of 265 mV required for the OER under 1.0 M KOH solution. The addition of 500 mM urea to the 1.0 M KOH solution decreases the overpotential required for the same current density from 265 to 93 mV. This study provides insights into the modification of surface structures and presents an effective strategy to optimize the electrocatalytic active sites and enhance the efficiency of multifunctional electrocatalysts.

TI Oxygen-Incorporated NiMoP Nanotube Arrays as Efficient Bifunctional
   Electrocatalysts For Urea-Assisted Energy-Saving Hydrogen Production in
   Alkaline Electrolyte
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB To couple hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising approach to produce H-2 with reduced energy consumption. However, the development of a low-cost and high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst toward HER and UOR is still a challenge. In this work, oxygen-incorporated nickel molybdenum phosphide nanotube arrays are synthesized on nickel foam (O-NiMoP/NF) via electrodeposition accompanied with in-situ template etching. Benefiting from the modulated electronic structure and the nanotube array architecture of O-NiMoP, the self-supporting O-NiMoP/NF electrodes demonstrate highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity toward HER and UOR. Particularly, in the HER and UOR (HER||UOR) coupled system for H-2 production, a significantly reduced cell voltage of 1.55 V is obtained at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), which is about 300 mV lower than that of the conventional water electrolysis. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the remarkable HER and UOR activities originated from the Ni sites with the modulated electronic environment induced by Mo, P and O atoms, which facilitate the water dissociation during HER and balance the adsorption/desorption of the intermediates during UOR. The development of Ni-based phosphides nanotube arrays as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in HER||OER system provides a new approach enabling energy-saving H-2 production.

TI Amorphous dominated metal hydroxide-organic framework with compositional
   and structural heterogeneity for enhancing anodic electro-oxidation
   reactions
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Inorganic-organic hybrids are promising anode catalysts to realize high activity and stability. Herein, an amorphous-dominated transition metal hydroxide-organic framework (MHOF) with isostructural mixed-linker was successfully synthesized on nickel foam (NF) substrate. The designed IML24-MHOF/NF exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity with an ultralow overpotential of 271 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and a potential of 1.29 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) at 10 mA center dot cm(-2). Furthermore, the IML24-MHOF/NF||Pt-C cell required only 1.31 V for urea electrolysis at 10 mA center dot cm(-2), which was much smaller than traditional water splitting (1.50 V). When coupled with UOR, the hydrogen yield rate was faster (1.04 mmol center dot h(-1)) than with OER (0.32 mmol center dot h(-1)) at 1.6 V. The structure characterizations, together with operando monitoring, including operando Raman, Fourier transform infrared, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and alcohol molecules probe, revealed that: (1) amorphous IML24-MHOF/NF prefers self-adaptive reconstruction into active intermediate species against the external stimulus; (2) pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate-incorporation into parent framework reconfigures electronic structure of system, thus mediating the absorption of oxygen-containing reactants during anodic oxidation reactions, such as O* and COO*. This work provides a new approach for boosting the catalytic activity of anodic electro-oxidation reactions by trimming the structure of MHOF-based catalysts.

AB Slow-release fertilizers are developed to enhance the nutrient use efficiency (NUE), by coating urea with less water soluble or hydrophobic material. Diverse range of materials have been utilized to coat urea, however, their inherit non -biodegradability, hydrophilicity, crystallinity, and high synthesis cost limits their scalability. Herein, we reported the preparation of a novel slow-release sulfur enriched urea fertilizers using sustainable hydrophobic, biodegradable, crosslinked copolymer made from sulfur and rubber seed oil (Poly(S-RSO)) through the use of dip coating method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to study the fertilizers morphology and estimate the coating film thickness. A nitrogen release test was carried out in distilled water, which revealed that the coated fertilizers with a coating thickness of 165 mu m, 254 mu m and 264 mu m released only 65 % of its total nutrient content after 2, 19 and 43 days of incubation, respectively: hence, showing an excellent slow-release property. In soil, fertilizer with 264 mu m coating thickness released only 17 % nitrogen after 20 days of incubation, in line with the European standard (EN 13266, 2001). The release kinetic data best fits the Ritger-Peppas model with a R-2 value of 0.99 and then value of 0.65 indicated the release was mainly due to diffusion. Submerged cultivation (SmC) demonstrated the potential of poly(S-RSO) to enhance sulfur oxidation; it was observed that the copolymer oxidation was 50 % greater than that of elemental sulfur. A comparison between the newly developed fertilizers and existing coated fertilizers was also presented. On the whole, the results demonstrated outstanding slow-release characteristics and improved sulfur oxidation.

TI Coated and un-coated urea incorporated with organic fertilizer improves
   rice nitrogen uptake and mitigates gaseous active nitrogen loss and
   microplastic pollution
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Coated urea can improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for crops, while it is also identified as a potential source of microplastics (MPs). Organic fertilizer (OF) shows potential to promote MPs degradation. However, little is known about the influence of OF incorporated with coated urea on MPs accumulation, NUE, and gaseous N loss (NH3 3 and N2O) 2 O) in paddies. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to address this gap, with five fertilization treatments, viz., urea (un-coated) with full rates (U), coated urea with full rates (CU), coated urea with reduced rates (RCU), 70 % coated urea blending 30% urea with reduced rates (RBU), and RBU blending OF (ORBU). The results showed that, compared with U, the CU increased the number of MPs by 62.2-117.4 %. The ORBU significantly reduced the weight of MPs by 53.2 % through decreasing large-particle size. Additionally, the ORBU enhanced the effect of CU on increasing grain yield and NUE, mainly due to the improvement in the yield components and N uptake. The distribution of NH4+ 4 + in water and soil was a major factor driving NH3 3 and N2O 2 O emissions. The ORBU elevated activities of N-assimilation enzymes, decreased water NH4+ 4 + and NH3 3 emissions, and increased soil NH4+ 4 + and ammonium-oxidation bacteria and ( nirK + nirS )/ nosZ , ultimately increased soil N2O 2 O emissions compared with RBU. However, the reduction in NH3 3 much outweighed the increase in N2O 2 O emissions. In conclusion, this study highlighted coated urea as a source of MPs pollution, emphasized OF amendment as a strategy to diminish MPs accumulation, and found that OF incorporated with coated urea could increase grain yield and N uptake of rice while mitigating gaseous N loss in paddies.

   formaldehyde
SO POLYMER BULLETIN
AB Polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) are the recyclable and easily processed thermoplastics which are commonly used as cable insulation materials. The improvement of thermal and structural properties of PP and HDPE is very important for aging processes. For this purpose, powdered waste urea-formaldehyde was added to PP and HDPE at 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 20 wt% and 30 wt% ratios. The thermal, structural and morphological properties of the produced samples were observed by using thermogravimetric differential thermal analyser, oxygen induction time tests, fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, X-ray diffractometer and scanning electron microscopy. By the results of the relevant study, the thermal and oxidative stability of the composites was improved by the incorporation of WUF into the polymer matrices. In conclusion, powdered urea-formaldehyde can be a cost-effective and good filler for PP and HDPE.

TI Choline Chloride-Urea Deep Eutectic Solvent Enhanced Removal of Lead
   from Mining Area Soil in the Presence of Oxalic Acid
SO EKOLOJI
AB Choline chloride-urea deep eutectic solvent (ChCl-urea DES) is a potential soil heavy metal eluent due to its advantages of low cost and simple synthesis, easy to biodegrade, and non-toxic. In this paper, the effect of ChCl-urea DES on the removal of lead from soil in the presence of oxalic acid was investigated. The experimental results indicate that ChCl-urea DES has a significantly enhanced effect on lead removal, the lead removal rate obviously increase from 49.8% to 71.1% as 3% of ChCl-urea DES was added to 0.2 mol/L oxalic acid under the condition of shaking time of 4 h and liquid/solid ratio of 10:1, the results suggest that ChCl-urea DES play a synergistic role with oxalic acid in the removal of lead from soil. Speciation analysis of lead was conducted using BCR sequential extraction method before and after washing. The result of speciation analysis indicates that oxalic acid-ChCl-urea DES was more effective in reducing the content of lead in each fraction than oxalic acid alone, particularly for acid-soluble fraction, followed by oxidation fraction and reducible fraction. The increased removal percentage is ranked in descending order: acid extracted fraction (36.2%) > reducible fraction (28.0%) > oxidizable fraction (22.6%) > residual fraction (18.0%). ChCl-urea DES can effectively remove most of mobile and bioavailable lead in contaminated soils in the presence of oxalic acid. The results are helpful to develop ChCl-urea DES based environment-friendly soil heavy metal washing system.

TI Self-Derivation and Surface Reconstruction of Fe-Doped
   Ni3S2 Electrode Realizing High-Efficient and
   Stable Overall Water and Urea Electrolysis
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Exploring earth-abundant, highly effective, and stable electrocatalysts for overall water and urea electrolysis is urgent and essential for developing hydrogen energy technology. Herein, a simple self-derivation method is used to fabricate a Fe-doped Ni3S2 electrode. The electrode exhibits an impressive trifunctional catalyst, with low overpotentials of 290, 198, and 254 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The durability is higher than 3500 h (146 days) at 100 mA cm(-2) for the OER without obvious change. In situ Raman spectra reveal the incorporation of Fe inhibited S dissolution and facilitates the catalyst reconstruction. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the doping of Fe optimizes the adsorption of the rate-determining step and the d-band center is closer to the Fermi level, which accelerates the OER process. The two-electrode electrolyzer needs the cell voltages of only 1.76 and 1.57 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and remarkable durability for more than 500 h at 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) for overall water and urea splitting. This work holds great promise for industrial water and urea splitting applications.

SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB Three new molybdenum (VI) complexes of 4,6-O-ethylidene-beta-d-glucopyranosylamine derived ligands has been synthesized and the same has been used in the oxidation of thioanisole along with an earlier reported analogous complex. A selective oxidation of thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulphoxide in high yield is achieved using 1:1 mixture of thioanisole and urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in ethanol. A longer reaction time or excess of UHP, leads to the formation of corresponding sulphone, which was confirmed using HPLC and NMR measurements.

TI Atomically dispersed Au single sites and nanoengineered structural
   defects enable a high electrocatalytic activity and durability for
   hydrogen evolution reaction and overall urea electrolysis
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The development of exceptionally active and stable trifunctional electrocatalysts is essential to facilitate industrial applications of proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Rare earth catalysts have a wide range of applications in alkaline solution oxidation, but limitations in their stability and activity prevent their further application. In this paper, Au doped CeO 2 coated porous Au x /CeO 2 ( x = 1,2,3) was designed as a three-function electrocatalyst with excellent performance and stability. At 1 M KOH conditions, both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reactions exhibit excess potentials of 159.6 and 320.8 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 . In addition, when incorporated into an Au 2 /CeO 2 (0.05 mmol, HAuCl 4 & sdot;4H 2 O) microparticles, the catalyst exhibits the potential of 1.42 V(10 mA cm-2 ) containing 0.33 M urea in 1 M KOH. Remarkably, for hydrogen production driven by urea electrolysis, Au 2 /CeO 2 demonstrated exceptional performance by requiring only a voltage input of 1.63 V. The reducing agent that forms the Au/CeO 2 heterojunction modulates the electronic structure of the Au active site and optimizes the adsorption of the intermediate. In addition, the interaction of the Au monolayer with the CeO 2 nanosphere effectively prevents excessive oxidation and dissolution of Au, and the porous hollow structure provides additional exposed active sites and facilitates mass transfer.

TI Surface engineering of Ni2P/CoP nanosheet heterojunctions by the
   formation of F-doped carbon layers for boosting urea-rich water
   electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB It's highly desirable but still challenging to design bifunctional non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with high activity and boosted mass transport, especially under large-current densities. Hence, a novel 3D reticular heterostructure nanosheet arrays are fabricated (Ni2P/CoP/P,F-C) through coupling the F-doped carbon to realize urea-rich water electrolysis. The interface of carbon doping F can effectively enhance the conductivity and stability of Ni2P/CoP heterojunctions along with possible changes in surface hydrophobicity to accelerate release of generated bubbles under large -current densities. Benefiting from tailored d-band center of CoP nanosheet arrays and well-designed hydrophilic-superaerophobic feature, the elaborated Ni2P/CoP/P,F-C electrode shows brilliant electrocatalytic HER (198 mV) and UOR (251 mV) performance at 100 mA cm-2 current density. Meanwhile, the assembled alkaline urea-rich water electrolyzer with Ni2P/CoP/P,F-C as both the cathode and anode present ultralow cell voltages of 1.57 V to achieve 100 mA cm-2 with long-time stability. This work will promote research interest in material design for energy conversion technologies and urea-assisted hydrogen production.

SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB A NiCo2O4 bimetallic electro-catalyst was synthesized on three-dimensional graphene (3D graphene) for the non-enzymatic detection of urea. The structural and morphological properties of the NiCo2O4/3D graphene nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The NiCo2O4/3D graphene was deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass to fabricate a highly sensitive urea sensor. The electrochemical properties of the prepared electrode were studied by cyclic voltammetry. A high sensitivity of 166 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) was obtained for the NiCo2O4/3D graphene/ITO sensor. The sensor exhibited a linear range of 0.06-0.30 mM (R-2=0.998) and a fast response time of approximately 1.0 s with a detection limit of 5.0 mu M. Additionally, the sensor exhibited high stability with a sensitivity decrease of only 5.5% after four months of storage in ambient conditions. The urea sensor demonstrates feasibility for urea analysis in urine samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Copper-incorporated hierarchical wire-on-sheet α-Ni(OH)2

   generation and urea oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Copper-incorporated alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanoarrays with a unique hierarchical wire-on-sheet structure and local Ni3+ species are explored as efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts for urea oxidation and water electrolysis. The unique hierarchical morphology can not only provide abundant reactive sites for the in situ generation of catalytically active species for electrooxidation reactions, but also guarantee a robust and conductive skeleton for facile charge transport and offer effective buffering space for the volume change during the Ni2+-to-Ni3+ pre-oxidation process. Besides, the presence of local Ni3+ ions and the optimal Cu concentration further enhance the electrooxidation behaviors such as the UOR and OER, and the role of the Cu dopant in boosting the HER activity toward long-term operation is illustrated as the generation of low-valence Cu that could effectively facilitate the electron transfer process. As a result, remarkable UOR, HER and OER performance can be achieved with the synergistic benefits of large surface area, enhanced charge transfer and robust structural stability, which can be beneficial for electrolytic cells for efficient coupled urea electrolysis and overall water splitting.

TI Urea-mediated synthesized carbon quantum dots to tune the
   electrochemical performance of polyaniline nanorods for supercapacitor
   device
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE-ADVANCED MATERIALS AND DEVICES
AB A polyaniline (PANi)-carbon quantum dots (CQDs) nanocomposite material with CQDs made from a PEG (polyethylene glycol and NaOH) source was synthesized. This unique synthesis technique was developed to overcome the setbacks of the PEG method by using UG (urea and glycine). PANi was synthesized by chemical oxidation in the presence of CQDs, which were prepared according to the two above-mentioned methods. The sample was further characterized by morphological, optical, and electrochemical experiments. FE-SEM showed ridge-like morphology and UV-Vis studies revealed the presence of PANi and CQDs. HRTEM images gave details on the uniformly distributed polyaniline, which showed lengthy rodlike rough surfaces with interconnected tiny CQDs. The electrochemical results from CV and GCD studies indicated an enhancement of the specific capacitance for sample PCQ-2 (CQDs synthesized via the UG method as a source) compared to only PANi and PCQ-1 (CQDs prepared by the PEG method). The cyclic stability established was 84.5% retention from initial capacitance values over 3000 cycles. A two-electrode prototype device was also developed with the PCQ-2 sample and it achieved a reasonable capacitance of 161.3 mF/cm(2) and demonstrated good retention stability over 5000 cycles. These results may be due to a variety of factors related to compositing CQDs (with urea and glycine as a source) with PANi. (C) 2021 Vietnam National University, Hanoi. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Modulation of the crystalline/amorphous interface engineering on
   Ni-P-O-based catalysts for boosting urea electrolysis at large current
   densities
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The intrinsically sluggish reaction dynamics of urea electrolysis at large current densities promote one to develop highly efficient catalysts so as to enable widely application of this meaningful catalytic model. In response, the Ni-P-O-based micro-nanostructures with rich crystalline/amorphous interface are rationally constructed by a facile electrodeposition strategy. A nickle oxide/phosphate (NiO-NiPi) synthesized under 1.2 V for 1 min displays prominent activity for catalyzing the anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR), whereas a nickel phosphide/NiO-NiPi generated under 1.1 V for 20 min (named as NiP/NiO-NiPi) possesses a faster cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) dynamics. Such tunable catalytic activities of the NiO-NiPi and NiP/NiO-NiPi may be correlated with their different interface structure and composition, which could accelerate the charge and electron transfer as well as increase active sites density for facilitating the absorption of urea and water. Impressively, the whole assembled cell using the developed NiO-NiPi//NiP/NiO-NiPi couple could deliver as high as 250 mA cm(-2) at an ultra-low potential of 1.67 V, 345 mV less than that of the pure water electrolysis, which hence makes an important step forward in obtaining massive energy-saving hydrogen by urea electrolysis at large current density.

TI In Situ Assembly of a Superaerophobic CoMn/CuNiP Heterostructure as a
   Trifunctional Electrocatalyst for Ampere-Level Current Density
   Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Production
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Urea electrolysis is a promising energy-efficient hydrogen production process with environmental benefits, but the lack of efficient and sustainable ampere-level current density electrocatalysts fabricated through simple methods is a major challenge for commercialization. Herein, we present an efficient and stable heterostructure electrocatalyst for full urea and water electrolysis in a convenient and time-efficient preparation manner. Overall, superhydrophilic/superaerophobic CoMn/CuNiP/NF exhibits exceptional performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (-33.8, -184.4, and -234.8 mV at -10, -500, and -1000 mA cm(-2), respectively), urea electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) [1.28, 1.43, and 1.51 V (vs RHE) at 10, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively], and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [1.45, 1.67, and 1.74 V (vs RHE) at 10, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively]. Moreover, the superaerophobic CoMn/CuNiP/NF demonstrates promising potential in full urea (1.33, 1.57, and 1.60 V at 10, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively) and water (1.46 V, 1.78, and 1.86 at 10, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively) electrolysis. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, it was determined that the surface of the CoMn/CuNiP electrode was rich in redox pairs such as Ni2+/Ni3+, Cu+/Cu2+, Co2+/Co3+, and Mn2+/Mn3+, which are crucial for the formation of active sites for the OER and UOR, such as NiOOH, MnOOH, and CoOOH, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. Besides, the in situ assembled CoMn/CuNiP/NF displayed highly stable performance for HER, OER, and UOR with high Faradaic efficiency for over 500 h. This research offers a simple and efficient method for manufacturing a high-efficiency and stable trifunctional electrocatalyst capable of delivering ampere-level current density in urea-assisted hydrogen production. Our density functional theory calculations reveal the potential of CoMn/CuNiP as an effective catalyst, enhancing the electronic properties and catalytic performance. The near-zero Gibbs free-energy change for HER underscores its promise, while reduced CO2 desorption energies and charge redistribution support efficient UOR. These findings signify CoMn/CuNiP's potential for electrochemical applications.

TI Electron modulation of cobalt carbonate hydroxide by Mo doping for
   urea-assisted hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Combining urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an effective method for energy saving and highly efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen production. Herein, molybdenum-incorporated cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanoarrays (CoxMoyCH) are designed and synthesized as a bifunctional catalyst towards UOR and HER. Benefiting from the Mo doping, the dispersed nanoarray structure and redistributed electron density, the CoxMoyCH catalyst display outstanding catalytic performance and durability for both HER and UOR, affording the overpotential of 82 mV for HER and delivering a low potential of the 1.33 V for UOR (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, when CoxMoyCH was applied as bifunctional catalyst in a two-electrode electrolyzer, a working voltage of 1.40 V is needed in urea-assisted water electrolysis at 10 mA cm(-2) and without apparent decline for 40 h, outperforming the working voltage of 1.51 V in conventional water electrolysis.

TI Electrochemical tuning of nickel molybdate nanorod arrays towards
   promoted electrocatalytic urea oxidization
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Urea electrolysis enables simultaneous energy-saving hydrogen production and wastewater purification at a small thermodynamic potential of 0.37 V; however, the total energy-utilization efficiency is still substantially restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the urea oxidization reaction (UOR) at the anode. In this work, an electrochemical tuning strategy has been employed to obtain a Ni (III)-enriched catalyst by starting from NiMoO4 center dot xH2O nanorod arrays. It has been found that the electrochemical tuning not only modifies the valency state of Ni but also causes a dramatic change in stoichiometry and microstructure of the material, leading to significantly improved activities for UOR under alkaline conditions. Notably, the obtained catalyst delivers a current density of 100 mA cm-2 for UOR at the potential of only 1.36 V vs RHE, which surpasses the bestreported values for UOR catalysis at the same applied potential, demonstrating the great promise of the electrochemical tuning strategy in rational modifications of material towards promoted electrocatalysis.

TI Vertically Oriented FeNiO Nanosheet Array for Urea and Water
   Electrolysis at Industrial-Scale Current Density
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB In addressing the challenging quest for an efficient electrocatalyst in electrochemical water splitting, we demonstrate an Fe-doped NiO nanosheet array anchored on nickel foam synthesized via a two-step process. Demonstrating exceptional performance in an alkaline electrolyte, FeNiO catalysts exhibit the oxygen evolution reaction with a low potential of 1.52 V vs RHE and the urea oxidation reaction of 1.32 V vs RHE @ 10 mA/cm(2). The bifunctional electrolyzer generates 10 mA/cm(2) current at 1.95 V for water and 1.59 V for urea electrolysis at ambient temperature. Promisingly, the FeNiO catalyst based electrolyzer generates hydrogen at an industrial-scale current density of 400 mA/cm(2) at a cell voltage of just 1.91 V in concentrated alkaline electrolyte and elevated temperature (80 degrees C) due to the dimensionally stable and robust behavior of the self-supported catalyst. The activation energy for alkaline water electrolysis is found to be 52 kJ/mol. The present catalysts also demonstrate stable performance at 300 mA/cm(2) in 4 M KOH electrolyte at 50 degrees C for more than 20 h. The synergy induced by Fe doping into NiO activates catalytic sites, expediting charge transfer and reaction kinetics. The present research report highlights the potential of catalysts as a practical and cost-effective approach for green hydrogen production via water splitting.

TI Effect of precursors on the structure and photocatalytic performance of
   g-C3N4 for NO oxidation and CO2
   reduction
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY
AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C[sub]3[/sub]N[sub]4[/sub], CN) is recognized as the most extensively studied organic polymeric photocatalyst for pollution control and energy conversion due to its facile synthesis and suitable electronic band structure. The aim of the present work is to explore the effect of precursors, such as urea (U, (NH[sub]2[/sub])[sub]2[/sub]CO), dicyandiamide (D, C[sub]2[/sub]H[sub]4[/sub]N[sub]4[/sub]) and melamine (M, C[sub]3[/sub]H[sub]6[/sub]N[sub]6[/sub]), on the structure and photocatalytic activity of the obtained CN samples, denoted as UCN, DCN and MCN, respectively. The sheet-like UCN sample shows significantly enhanced photoreactivity in both NO oxidation and CO[sub]2[/sub]reduction compared to the bulk DCN and MCN materials. In addition, UCN demonstrates the ability to suppress the formation of toxic NO[sub]2[/sub]intermediate during the photocatalytic oxidation of NO. The improved photocatalytic activity of UCN can be attributed to a dual effect: first, its increased specific surface area provides more active sites for the photocatalytic reaction; second, it exhibits a stronger affinity for substrates like NO and CO[sub]2[/sub], which facilitates charge migration at the interface.

TI Electronic and vacancy engineering of ruthenium doped hollow-structured
   NiO/Co3O4 nanoreactors for low-barrier electrochemical urea-assisted
   energy-saving hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Discovering a valid approach to achieve a novel and efficient water splitting catalyst is essential for the development of hydrogen energy technology. Herein, unique hollow-structured ruthenium (Ru)-doped nickel-cobalt oxide (Ru-NiO/Co3O4/NF) nanocube arrays are fabricated as high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/urea oxidation reaction (UOR) through combined electronic and vacancy engineering. The structural characterization and experimental results indicate that the doping of Ru can not only effectively modulate the electronic structure of Ru-NiO/Co3O4/NF, but also increase the content of oxygen vacancies in the structure of Ru-NiO/Co3O4/NF to stabilize the existence of oxygen vacancies during the catalytic process. This can optimize the adsorption and desorption of the reactive intermediates on the surface of Ru-NiO/ Co3O4/NF and dramatically accelerate the HER and UOR kinetics. As a result, the Ru-NiO/Co3O4/NF hollow structure nanocube arrays exhibit overpotentials of 21 and 60 mV for HER, as well as potentials of 1.36 and 1.42 V for UOR at 10 and 100 mA cm- 2, respectively. Furthermore, the coupled HER and UOR system requires only 1.59 V of cell voltage to drive a current density of 100 mA cm- 2, which is approximately 240 mV lower than conventional water electrolysis. This work provides a tremendous promise for the development of novel and high-activity electrocatalysts in future energy conversion applications.

TI Facile synthesis of Ni-decorated multi-layers graphene sheets as
   effective anode for direct urea fuel cells
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB A large amount of urea-containing wastewater is produced as a by-product in the fertilizer industry, requiring costly and complicated treatment strategies. Considering that urea can be exploited as fuel, this wastewater can be treated and simultaneously exploited as a renewable energy source in a direct urea fuel cell. In this study, multi-layers graphene/nickel nanocomposites were prepared by a one-step green method for use as an anode in the direct urea fuel cell. Typically, commercial sugar was mixed with nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate in distilled water and then calcined at 800 degrees C for 1 h. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to characterize the final product. The results confirmed the formation of multi-layers graphene sheets decorated by nickel nanoparticles. To investigate the influence of metal nanoparticles content, samples were prepared using different amounts of the metal precursor; nickel acetate content was changed from 0 to 5 wt.%. Investigation of the electrochemical characterizations indicated that the sample prepared using the original solution with 3 wt.% nickel acetate had the best current density, 81.65 mA/cm(2) in a 0.33 M urea solution (in 1 M KOH) at an applied voltage 0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl. In a passive direct urea fuel cell based on the optimal composition, the observed maximum power density was 4.06 x 10(-3) mW/cm(2) with an open circuit voltage of 0.197 V at room temperature in an actual electric circuit. Overall, this study introduces a cheap and beneficial methodology to prepare effective anode materials for direct urea fuel cells. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI Modeling urea-selective catalyst reduction with vanadium catalyst based
   on NH3 temperature programming desorption experiment
SO FUEL
AB The selective catalyst reaction technology was stipulated under the IMO Tier 3 regulation for controlling NOx emissions from marine diesel engines. This paper presents a steady kinetic model of urea-SCR with a vanadium-based catalyst. Simulation was carried out using a commercial one-dimensional aftertreatment code coupled with an optimizer. Optimization was performed using experimental NH3 temperature programming desorption (TPD) data. The simulated data and trends in NH3 and NOx reactions under different temperatures, NO/NO2 ratios, space velocities and NH3/NOx ratios produced generally good agreement with experimental measurements. At increased space velocities, the NOx and NH3 reaction rates decreased, but this had no effect on the NOx conversion rate until over 400 degrees C. Over 450 degrees C, the NH3 oxidation of ammonia was equal to the NOx conversion rate due to NH3 oxidation. Based on these results, an optimal condition was proposed for urea-SCR in terms of NH3/NOx ratio and temperature. In the case of NH3/NOx = 0.8, the NOx conversion rate was 80% and NH3 slip was no occur over 200 degrees C. The optimal NOx conversion condition for these two performance indicators is estimated to be NH3/NOx = 0.8-1.0 at 300 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of temperature and precursor concentration on the morphology of
   Cu/γ-Al2O3 prepared via urea combustion method
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB Mesoporous gamma alumina (gamma-Al2O3) was successfully prepared via urea route synthesis. Different urea concentration effects were investigated toward the material's characterization. Calcination was done at 500 degrees C for 3 h to obtain gamma-Al2O3. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that the urea was decomposed completely after calcination. The amorphous gamma phase of alumina was transformed completely into crystalline alpha phase, accompanied by a lower surface area of alumina at a higher concentration of urea. Copper was added by wet impregnation and the gamma-Al2O3 was then calcined at different temperatures to study the effect on the material's properties. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) characterization showed peaks that belong to CuO and CuAl2O4. As the calcination temperature rose, the peak intensity of the CuAl2O4 became higher. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that CuO nanoparticles covered the surface of the gamma-Al2O3. The absence of a gamma-Al2O3 diffraction peak was due to its low crystallinity.

   samples
SO MICROCHIMICA ACTA
AB A flexible, wearable, non-invasive contact lens sensor utilizing nickel-cobalt metal-organic framework (Ni-Co-MOF) based hydrogel is introduced for urea monitoring in tear samples. The synthesized Ni-Co-MOF hydrogel exhibits a porous structure with interconnected voids, as visualized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Detailed structural and vibrational properties of the material were characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The developed Ni-Co-MOF hydrogel sensor showcases a detection limit of 0.445 mM for urea within a linear range of 0.5-70 mM. Notably, it demonstrates exceptional selectivity, effectively distinguishing against interfering species like UA, AA, glucose, dopamine, Cl-, K+, Na+, Ca2+, and IgG. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of the Ni-Co-MOF hydrogel electrode is attributed to the presence of Ni and Co, fostering Ni2+ oxidation on the surface and forming a Co2+ complex that acts as a catalyst for urea oxidation. The fabricated sensor exhibits successful detection and retrieval of urea in simulated tear samples, showcasing promising potential for bioanalytical applications. The binder-free, non-toxic nature of the Ni-Co-MOF hydrogel sensor presents exciting avenues for future utilization in non-enzymatic electrochemical sensing, including applications in wearable devices, point-of-care diagnostics, and personalized healthcare monitoring.

TI Carboxyl functionalization of carbon fibers via aryl diazonium reaction
   in molten urea to enhance interfacial shear strength
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Using molten urea as the solvent, carbon fibers were functionalized with carboxylic acid groups via aryl diazonium reaction in 15 min to improve their interfacial bonding with epoxy resin. The surface functionalization was quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which showed that the relative surface coverage of carboxylic acid groups increased from an initial percentage of 3.17-10.41%. Mechanical property test results indicated that the aryl diazonium reaction in this paper could improve the interfacial shear strength by 66%. Meanwhile, the technique did not adopt any pre-oxidation step to produce functional groups prior to grafting and was shown to maintain the tensile strength of the fibers. This methodology provided a rapid, facile and economically viable route to produce covalently functionalized carbon fibers in large quantities with an eco-friendly method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI The Electrochemical Analysis of Cadmium in Choline Chloride/Urea Deep
   Eutectic Solvent Electrolyte at Carbon Nanotubes Modified Electrode
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The electrochemical behavior of Cd at choline chloride/urea electrolyte and multi-wall carbon nanotubes modified electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). A couple of sensitive and quasi-reversible redox peaks of Cd was obtained with - 0.75 V of oxidation peak potential (E-pa) and -0.91 of reduction peak potential (E-pc) (Delta E = 0.16 V) in choline chloride /urea ionic liquids and 0.1mol.L-1 HAc-NaAc mixed buffer system (pH 5.4). A sensitive DPV method for the determination of Cd was proposed. The oxidization peak was linearly related to the concentration of Cd in the range of 6.0 x 10(-4)-1.5x10(-2) mu g.mL(-1), the detection limit was 6.8x10(-5) mu g.mL(-1). The proposed method is quick, sensitive, reliable and can be used for the determination of (C)d in environment and food.

TI A simple sonochemical approach to fabricate a urea biosensor based on
   zinc phthalocyanine/graphene oxide/urease bioelectrode
SO ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY
AB A novel zinc phthalocyanine/graphene oxide (ZnPh/GO) nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was prepared by using sonochemical approach and simple drop casting method. Urease (Urs) was used as the specific enzyme for urea detection and was physically immobilized onto the surface of ZnPh/GO nanocomposite. The fabricated ZnPh/GO/Urs matrix was successfully characterized by UV vis-spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), raman spectrum, thermogravimetric analysis, cyclic voltammetric (CV) and amperometric techniques. The electrocatalytic performance of the ZnPh/GO/Urs electrode was investigated by urea biosensor. Our results demonstrate that the modified electrode has excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the sensing of urea in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.2). The biosensor tolerated a wide linear concentration range for urea from 0.4 to 22 mu M (R-2 = 0.991), with a detection limit of 0.034 mu M (S/N = 3). The ZnPh/GO/Urs bioectrode has several excellent properties, including a fast response time, high reproducibility and stability.

TI Electronic Structure Modulation Via Iron-Incorporated NiO to Boost Urea
   Oxidation/Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The urea-assisted water splitting not only enables a reduction in energy consumption during hydrogen production but also addresses the issue of environmental pollution caused by urea. Doping heterogeneous atoms in Ni-based electrocatalysts is considered an efficient means for regulating the electronic structure of Ni sites in catalytic processes. However, the current methodologies for synthesizing heteroatom-doped Ni-based electrocatalysts exhibit certain limitations, including intricate experimental procedures, prolonged reaction durations, and low product yield. Herein, Fe-doped NiO electrocatalysts were successfully synthesized using a rapid and facile solution combustion method, enabling the synthesis of 1.1107 g within a mere 5 min. The incorporation of iron atoms facilitates the modulation of the electronic environment around Ni atoms, generating a substantial decrease in the Gibbs free energy of intermediate species for the Fe-NiO catalyst. This modification promotes efficient cleavage of C-N bonds and consequently enhances the catalytic performance of UOR. Benefiting from the tunability of the electronic environment around the active sites and its efficient electron transfer, Fe-NiO electrocatalysts only needs 1.334 V to achieve 50 mA cm(-2) during UOR. Moreover, Fe-NiO catalysts were integrated into a dual electrode urea electrolytic system, requiring only 1.43 V of cell voltage at 10 mA cm(-2).

TI Adsorptive Removal of Artificial Sweeteners from Water Using
   Metal-Organic Frameworks Functionalized with Urea or Melamine
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB A highly porous metal organic framework (MOP), MIL-101, was modified to introduce urea or melamine via grafting on open metal sites of the MOF. Adsorptive removal of three artificial sweeteners (ASWs) was studied using the MOFs, with or without modifications (including nitration), and activated carbon (AC). The adsorbed quantities (based on the weight of the adsorbent) of saccharin (SAC) under various conditions decreased in the order urea-MIL-101 > melamine-MIL-101 > MIL-101 > AC > 02N-MIL-101; however, the quantities based on unit surface area are in the order melamine-MIL-101 > urea-MIL-101 > MIL-101 > O2N-MIL-101. Similar ASWs [acesulfame (ACE) and cyclamate (CYC)] showed the same tendency. The mechanism for very favorable adsorption of SAC, ACE, and CYC over urea- and melamine-MIL-101 could be explained by H-bonding on the basis of the contents of NH2 groups on the MOFs and the adsorption results under a wide range of pH values. Moreover, the direction of H-bonding could be clearly defined (H-acceptor: ASWs; H donor: MOFs). Urea-MIL-101 and melamine-MIL-101 could be suggested as competitive adsorbents for organic contaminants (such as ASWs) with electronegative atoms, considering their high adsorption capacity (for example, urea-MIL-101 had 2.3 times the SAC adsorption of AC)' and ready regeneration.

TI Competent production of hydrogen and hydrogenation of carboxylic acids
   using urea-rich waste water over visible-light-responsive rare earth
   doped photocatalyst
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Background: A strategy employing water as a hydrogen source is promising but challenging. Conversely, urea is the major pollutants causing substantial water pollution. Moreover, direct reduction of carboxylic acids into aldehydes is still a great challenge due to higher propensity of aldehydes being further reduced to alcohols.Methods: We report a visible-light driven one-step protocol to selectively convert aromatic carboxylic acids to aldehydes with water as the sustainable hydrogen source, environmental pollutant urea as a hole scavenger and Eu3+ doped Na2CaP2O7 phosphor as a viable photocatalyst. Significant findings: Apart from the photocatalytic H2 evolution, the procedure is able to reduce a broad range of carboxylic substrates with good functional group tolerance in good to excellent yield. The insertion of Eu3+ into the present host creates several metastable states inside the forbidden region and thereby led to enhancement of photo stimulation process. Moreover, various experiments and analytical analysis reveal that photo-generated active H-species from water are the direct reducing agent, skipping the use of traditional flammable H2. Pre-sent work provides a 'waste-to-value' route for solar energy driven preparation of valuable chemicals by simultaneous photocatalytic treatment of urea-rich waste water.

TI Flexible Electrochemical Sensor Based on NiCu(OOH) for Monitoring Urea
   in Human Sweat
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Wearable and flexible electrochemical sweat analysis for monitoring health-related urea concentrations with high sensitivity and selectivity is highly required for individual medical care and disease diagnosis. Herein, we report a sensitive and selective sweat sensor based on a flexible NiCu(OOH)/polystyrene (PS) electrode to detect a urea biomarker. The non-enzymatic sensor was fabricated using electrospinning PS containing carbon nanotube as a conductive component and co-sputtering Ni-Cu alloys as a catalyst. The flexible PS provided a porous structure, leading to sufficient active sites, easy access to reactants, and adequate water wettability for effective charge transfer. The sputtered Ni-Cu alloys deposited on the PS were transformed to a Ni-Cu oxyhydroxide form by cyclic voltammetry treatment, managing the detection of the urea molecule in a neutral pH environment. This urea sensor displayed an excellent linear response with a sensitivity of 10.72 mu AmM(-1)cm(-2) toward a physiologically appropriate linear range of 2.00-30.00 mM, and negligible interferences from co-existing common species. Furthermore, bending tests demonstrated excellent mechanical tolerance where electrochemical performance was not affected under 200 cycles and 150 degrees bending. The flexible electrochemical urea sensor platform can provide noninvasive monitoring of urea levels in sweat fluids, ensuring clinical diagnosis for biomedical applications.

TI Constructing Hierarchical Fluffy CoO-Co4N@NiFe-LDH Nanorod
   Arrays for Highly Effective Overall Water Splitting and Urea
   Electrolysis
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Exploration of highly efficient bifunctional electro-catalysts for optimal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been widely carried out, though it still remains a big challenge. Herein, a hierarchical CoO-Co4N@NiFe-LDH (layered-double-hydroxides) heterostructure electrode anchored on nickel foam (NF) is prepared via a developed three-step hydrothermal-nitridation-electrodeposition pathway. The fabricated CoO-Co4N@NiFe-LDH/NF electrode needs low overpotential values of 66 and 231 mV to supply a current density value of 10 mA cm(-2) in aqueous solution of KOH (1 M) for HER and OER, respectively. The Tafel slopes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results display favorable reaction kinetics throughout the electrolysis process. Subsequently, an alkaline electrolyzer is assembled with CoO-Co4N@NiFeLDH/NF, which serves both as the anode and cathode, yielding 10 mA cm(-2) with a small voltage of 1.529 V and showing a robust stability for 28 h. Impressively, a urine-mediated electrolysis cell shows efficient catalytic activity as well, allowing to mount the sluggish OER during water splitting. To drive the urine-mediated electrolysis cell containing 0.33 M urea, a low voltage of 1.393 V is required, which is about 136 mV lower compared to the urea-free electrolysis cell. This work presents a solid step for the electrocatalytic generation of hydrogen through water splitting by harvesting low energy.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Developing cost-effective, durable anode electrodes is essential for commercializing direct urea fuel cells (FCs). In the current study, standalone copper hydroxide nanograss was grown on the surface of the copper foam at room temperature. The surface morphology, elemental analysis, and crystalline structure were investigated. The prepared materials demonstrated a high activity towards urea electro-oxidation that increased with increasing urea concentration and slightly decreased at 4 M. The generated current using the modified electrodes is almost twice that obtained using the bare copper foam. The electrodes effectively operated for a prolonged current discharge (15 hr) using 3 M urea with outstanding stability. The morphology of the nanograss was retained even after such a very long time of operation. Moreover, the prepared materials are effectively used for the current generation from real urine with and without pH adjustment. Finally, real FC operation using urine was verified, showing an open circuit voltage of 1 V. The cell was operated for a long time, demonstrating the potential of the prepared electrodes for commercialization to realize simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation from urine and other urea-contaminated wastewater.

TI Synthesis of glycerol carbonate from glycerol and urea over lanthanum

SO REACTION KINETICS MECHANISMS AND CATALYSIS
AB The synthesis of glycerol carbonate (GC) from glycerol and urea was investigated over a series of lanthanum compounds. Among them, LaCl3 showed the best catalytic activity. The conversion of glycerol could be 95.4 % with 99.9 % selectivity towards GC under the optimum reaction conditions. Then, it was found that for these catalysts, their solubility in the reaction system during reaction was the key to achieve high glycerol conversion and GC selectivity. Meanwhile, catalytic tests and FTIR measurements of the liquid phases after reaction confirmed that this approach could be divided into two steps, and the second one was the key step. Interestingly, it was revealed that some La-containing complex species could be formed via NH3 coordination to La3+ during the reaction. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed based on these systematic experimental results.

TI Urea-cysteine based extraction of densely crosslinked proteins from
   sorghum distillers grains with high yield and quality
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB A urea-cysteine based system is developed to extract densely crosslinked sorghum proteins from sorghum distillers grains with high efficiency and quality. Due to the high crosslinking degrees, sorghum proteins are expected to possess better tensile properties and aqueous stabilities than common proteins, thus become a promising candidate to replace the unsustainable petroleum products. However, due to the long-standing difficulty in dissolution of densely crosslinked proteins, to extract sorghum proteins with high efficiency and quality for satisfactory properties in end products has not been achieved by previous methods In this paper, a urea-cysteine based system is used to replace the most widely used ethanol based system. The urea-cysteine based system endows sorghum proteins with high purity and yield, which are 14% and 42% higher than those from the ethanol based system. Based on amine and thiol group analysis, the urea-cysteine based system provides sorghum proteins with preserved peptide backbones, full breakage of disulfide bonds for linear structures and sufficient thiol groups for re-oxidation. Due to such unique structures and thus regular arrangement of protein molecules during film casting, sorghum protein films from the urea-cysteine based system have crystallinity 21% higher than those from the ethanol based system. Tensile properties and water-vapor-barrier properties of sorghum protein films are improved by 27% and 28% compared to the ethanol based system. Sorghum protein films derived from sorghum distillers grains are first reported and their tensile properties are better than those of all sorghum protein films developed previously. Quantified effects of preservation of protein peptide backbones and recovery of disulfide bonds on tensile strength are also compared. With the unique structures, sorghum proteins from the urea-cysteine based system have great potential to achieve excellent properties in various applications, such as films and fibers, which account for a total market share of over $100 billion worldwide.

TI Co-Ni Layered Double Hydroxide for the Electrocatalytic Oxidation of
   Organic Molecules: An Approach to Lowering the Overall Cell Voltage for
   the Water Splitting Process
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Electrocatalytic oxidation of simple organic molecules oilers a promising strategy to combat the sluggish kinetics of the water oxidation reaction (WOR). The low potential requirement, inhibition of the crossover of gases, and formation of value-added products at the anode are benefits of the electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules. Herein, we developed cobalt-nickel-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) as a robust material for the electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols and urea at the anode, replacing the WOR. A facile synthesis protocol to form LDHs with different ratios of Co and Ni is adapted. It demonstrates that the reactants could be efficiently oxidized to concomitant chemical products at the anode. The half-cell study shows an onset potential of 1.30 V for benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction (BAOR), 1.36 V for glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), 1.33 V for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), and 1.32 V for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) compared with 1.53 V for WOR. Notably, the hybrid electrolyzer in a full-cell configuration significantly reduces the overall cell voltage at a 20 mA cm(-2) current density by similar to 15% while coupling with the BAOR, EOR, and GOR and similar to 12% with the UOR as the anodic half-cell reaction. Furthermore, the efficiency of hydrogen generation remains unhampered with the types of oxidation reactions (alcohols and urea) occurring at the anode. This work demonstrates the prospects of lowering the overall cell voltage in the case of a water electrolyzer by integrating the hydrogen evolution reaction with suitable organic molecule oxidation.

   enhanced water splitting and urea oxidation: A plasma-assisted approach
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The design of high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting and urea oxidation reactions requires effective regulation of their electronic structure and electrochemical surface area (ECSA). In this study, we developed an in-situ grown Fe-MOF electrocatalyst on Fe foam (FF) by using a combination of easy hydrothermal synthesis and advanced plasma technology (Fe-MOF/FF). By varying the plasma treatment time, we could tailor the surface morphology and electronic structure of the Fe-MOF/FF microrods. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations investigated the catalytic mechanism, revealing that plasma-treated Fe-MOF/FF has a lower energy barrier for water splitting and H* adsorption during the HER process, and higher catalytic activity for UOR. Additionally, the electronic density of optimized Fe-MOF/FF is significantly expanded near the Fermi level. Remarkably, our catalysts achieved exceptional activity in both water splitting and urea electrolysis, requiring only 1.54 V and 1.472 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm-2, with excellent stability. Our findings highlight the potential of plasma technology as a powerful tool for developing multifunctional electrocatalysts for clean energy and industrial wastewater treatment applications.

TI Simple Urea Immersion Enhanced Removal of Tetracycline from Water by
   Polystyrene Microspheres
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Antibiotics pose potential ecological risks in the water environment, necessitating their effective removal by reliable technologies. Adsorption is a conventional process to remove such chemicals from water without byproducts. However, finding cheap adsorbents with satisfactory performance is still a challenge. In this study, polystyrene microspheres (PSM) were enhanced to adsorb tetracycline by surface modification. Simple urea immersion was used to prepare urea-immersed PSM (UPSM), of which surface groups were characterized by instruments to confirm the effect of immersion. Tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) and doxycycline (DC) were used as typical adsorbates. The adsorptive isotherms were interpreted by Langmuir, Freundlich, and Tempkin models. After urea immersion, the maximum adsorption capacity of UPSM at 293 K and pH 6.8 increased about 30% and 60%, achieving 460 mg/g for TC and 430 mg/g for DC. The kinetic data were fitted by first-order and second-order kinetics and Weber Morris models. The first-order rate constant for TC adsorption on UPSM was 0.41 /h, and for DC was 0.33 /h. The cyclic urea immersion enabled multilayer adsorption, which increased the adsorption capacities of TC on UPSM by two to three times. The adsorption mechanism was possibly determined by the molecular interaction including pi-pi forces, cation-pi bonding, and hydrogen bonding. The simple surface modification was helpful in enhancing the removal of antibiotics from wastewater with similar structures.

TI Preparation and application of Cu/ZnO catalyst by urea hydrolysis method
   for low-temperature methanol synthesis from syngas
SO FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB The Cu/ZnO catalyst prepared by urea hydrolysis method was investigated for low-temperature methanol synthesis from syngas containing CO2. Concurrently, the activity of the conventional Cu/ZnO catalyst prepared by co-precipitation method was also compared. The effects of precipitation temperature, urea content, stirring speed and the introduction of Al on the catalytic performance of Cu/ZnO were deeply studied. It was found that the total carbon conversion of the Cu/ZnO catalyst prepared by urea hydrolysis method was increased to 45.0% from 32.8%, comparing with that of the catalyst prepared by co-precipitation method. The structure, BET surface area, surface morphology of the catalyst were characterized by XRD, BET, EDX and SEM. The catalyst prepared by urea method obtained higher BET surface area and larger metallic surface area of Cu than those of the co-precipitation method. The crystals sizes of Cu by urea method were smaller than those of co-precipitation method. Surface structure prepared by urea method had needle shape, and it could increase the surface area, different from the catalyst by co-precipitation method. Both the increased BET surface area of the catalysts and the enhanced metallic surface area of Cu promoted the catalyst activity for the low-temperature methanol synthesis. The deactivation of the Cu-ZnO catalysts prepared by urea method was not observed in low-temperature methanol synthesis here. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Understanding the Electrochemically Induced Conversion of Urea to
   Ammonia Using Nickel Based Catalysts
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB In this paper, the mechanism of the electrochemically induced hydrolysis of urea to ammonia (eU2A) at 70 degrees C in alkaline medium using nickel electrodes was investigated. The intermediates and products in the bulk solution were monitored by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The intermediates and products of the reaction on the catalyst surface were analyzed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy. Urea electrolysis and thermal hydrolysis of urea to ammonia (in the bulk solution) take place in parallel to the eU2A process. The ammonia production rate depends strongly on the amount of nickel oxyhydroxide as well as the concentration of OH ions. The redox couple of Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions plays an important role in the mechanism of the reaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Modulation electronic structure of NiS nanoarray induced by Fe, V doping
   for high efficiency water and urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY
AB Exploring high-efficient and stable low-cost electrocatalysts is of significant importance for boosting the efficiency of water splitting and purifying urea-enriched wastewater. Herein, bimetallic doping strategy was adopted to obtain jasminum nudiflorum-like Fe, V doped NiS arrays (Fe, V-NiS/NF) via typical hydrothermal process and subsequent anion exchange reaction. The as-obtained Fe, V-NiS/NF array displays high catalytic activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in alkaline media, with reduced overpotentials of 273 and 214 mV to deliver the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for OER and UOR, respectively. More notably, when employing Fe, V-NiS/NF as symmetric electrolytic cell for urea electrolysis, a low cell voltage of 1.45 V is needed at 10 mA cm(-2), which is about 110 mV lower than the conventional water electrolysis. Meanwhile, the catalyst also displays superior stability for over 72 h. Such outstanding performance is attributed to the following points: (i) 3D porous flower-like structure facilitates the mass transfer and abundant exposure of active sites; (ii) in situ growth of catalysts on conductive substrate and the effective interface engineering of different composition shorten the charge transport pathways and expedite electron transfer. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the Fe and V dopants regulate the electronic environment of Ni sites and optimize the adsorption free energy of urea. This work provides a universal pathway to design high-efficient and non-noble electrocatalysts for H-2 production in an energy-saving way via urea electrolysis.

TI Biochar-based urea increases soil methane uptake in a subtropical forest
SO GEODERMA
AB Novel biochar-based fertilizers, produced by combining biochar particles with chemical fertilizers, have strong potential to enrich soil with carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), and to increase plant productivity. Application of biochar-based fertilizers modifies soil microbial community compositions, thereby influencing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane (CH4) fluxes. Due to the improved aeration in soils amended with biochar particles, we hypothesized that biochar-based urea would decrease CH4 production and increase CH4 oxidation, leading to increase of total CH4 uptake by soil. A three-year field experiment was conducted in a subtropical Moso bamboo forest to compare the impacts of biochar-based urea and traditional urea on seasonal CH4 uptake by soil, as well as on soil physicochemical and microbial attributes. Urea application lowered the annual soil CH4 uptake by 6 % and 16% at 100 and 300 kg N/ha, respectively, within the first year. Biochar-based urea application at 300 kg N/ha increased the annual CH4 uptake by 12 % in both the first and second years, whereas the effects weakened over time. Soil CH4 uptake was positively correlated with CH4 oxidation rate but negatively with CH4 production rate. The urea-induced decrease in CH4 uptake was attributed to the increased NH4+ and NO3- contents and mcrA gene abundance as well as decreased pmoA/mcrA ratio, thereby increasing CH4 production rate. The biocharbased urea increased CH4 uptake by enhanced soil aeration and labile C supply, which created favorable conditions for methanotrophs. This resulted in increased pmoA gene abundance and the pmoA/mcrA ratio, thereby accelerating CH4 oxidation. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of biochar-based fertilizers in augmenting CH4 uptake within subtropical forest soils. Notably, the transition from traditional urea to biochar-based urea in China Moso bamboo forests alone has the potential to lift annual soil CH4 uptake by an estimated 4450 t.

   as extremely efficient and robust electrocatalyst for urea
   electrocatalysis
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Here, we fabricated N,S-Carbon (NSC) enfolded MnFe2O4 (MFO) nanospheres with abundant oxygen defects (OV), exploited as brilliant electrocatalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This typical nanoarchitecture possesses many characteristic compensations, (i) incorporation of OV in MFO to moderate the electronic arrangement for enhancing the electrons mobility and offering additional space for electrocatalysis and rapid absorption/diffusion of ions, (ii) homogeneously dispersed MFO nanospheres with great number of active sites and excellent catalytic activity, (iii) robust interaction between NSC and MFO ensuring the longstanding electrochemical stability, which are favorable to enhancing the kinetics of urea electrocatalysis. Electrochemical measurements proved NSC-MFO possesses outstanding UOR activity that shows a low potential of 1.42 V to attain 50 mA/cm(2), too NSC-MFO contributes to excellent HER activity with low overpotential of 0.192 V to attain 50 mA/cm(2). The excellent UOR performance of NSC-MFO authenticates could be wonderful applicant to replace OER to lower the cell potential thus decrease consumption of electrical energy for hydrogen-gas generation. As a proof of concept, overall urea splitting has been done with NSC-MFO as both cathode and anode, as-fabricated urea electrolytic cell offered 10 mA/cm(2) at the cell voltage of 1.43 V with good durability for 15 h, displaying its potential practicability for energy-saving hydrogen making.

SO KINETICS AND CATALYSIS
AB Gold nanoparticles supported over mesoporous ceria (Au/CeO2), titania (Au/TiO2) and iron oxide (Au/Fe2O3) were prepared by deposition-precipitation with urea and used for toluene oxidation. The mesoporous CeO2, Fe2O3, andTiO(2) were synthesized employing a hard-template approach using SBA-15 as the template. The catalysts were characterized by BET, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H-2-temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy (DR/UV-Vis), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Based on the temperature required to achieve 50% toluene conversion in the oxidation reaction (T-50%), the activity sequence was Au/CeO2 > Au/Fe2O3 > Au/TiO2. The Au/CeO2 catalyst was the most active catalyst, achieving 50% toluene conversion at 240 degrees C and full toluene conversion at 295 degrees C demonstrating high stability over successive catalytic runs.

TI Bimetallic NiCu alloy nanoparticles supported on porous carbon
   nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for methanol and urea
   electrooxidation
SO IONICS
AB The development of non-precious, efficient, and nanostructured electrocatalysts using a facile method to replace noble metal-based electrocatalysts has received wide attention in the field of fuel cell technology. In this study, a highly efficient and non-precious electrocatalyst was fabricated via facile and in situ two-step method. The electrocatalyst that has been developed relies on the utilization of nickel-copper alloy nanoparticles (NiCu), which have been supported on porous carbon nanosheets (PCNs). The preparation method involved a microwave-assisted fabrication of carbon quantum dots with nickel and copper ions chelated on their surface, followed by calcination to produce NiCu@PCNs. The structure and the surface morphology of NiCu@PCNs were investigated by TGA, XRD, TEM, and SEM techniques. XRD results proved that the average size of bimetallic Ni-Cu is 18.31 nm, and PCNs are made up of 9.33 stacked graphitic layers. TEM image confirmed that NiCu NPs are encapsulated into carbon and distributed over the PCNs, forming a core-shell nanostructure. The electrocatalysts, NiCu@PCNs, possess a favorable electrochemically active surface area of 116 cm(-2) and exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation in comparison to urea. The onset potentials value of methanol and urea oxidation were 0.34 V and 0.38 V vs. Ag/AgCl and the highest current densities of 140 and 62 mA cm(-2), respectively. This study provides a simplistic method for the design of PCNs-supported bimetallic nanoparticles, which can serve as non-precious electrocatalysts and an alternative to noble metal-based catalysts.

TI Ammonia oxidizing archaea do not respond to ammonium or urea supply in
   an alkaline soil
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB Strains of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) can utilize urea under limited conditions of ammonia in terrestrial environments. In this work, we investigate whether this mechanism operates more widely, including soils with non-limiting conditions of ammonia. To test this hypothesis, pots filled with a soil of basic pH (8.3) were supplied with two rates of N (25 and 50 mu g N/g dry soil) in the form of urea and ammonium applied at seven consecutive doses every 2 days. The findings of the study revealed a strong increase in the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) at both application rates, independently of N source. By contrast, AOA did not respond to N additions. These findings indicate that urea availability does not offer an advantage on the growth and activity of AOA over the AOB under non-limiting conditions of N. However, a slight increase in AOA abundance following substrate utilization provided support for a link between AOA growth and mineralization of soil organic matter.

TI Superior electrocatalytic performance of nitrogen-doped carbon-embedded
   Ni/NiO/NiB nanocrystals for urea oxidation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can serve as an alternative to the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop efficient and cheap electrocatalysts to improve the kinetics of the UOR. In this study, a Ni/NiO/NiB@NC-500 composite was prepared by anchoring Ni/NiO/NiB nanoparticles on a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate through a straightforward hydrothermal-pyrolysis method. The optimal Ni/NiO/NiB@NC-500 composite exhibited remarkable activity and stability for the UOR, that is, the current density (j) of Ni/NiO/NiB@NC-500 for the UOR was 264 mA cm-2 at a potential of 1.67 V. Furthermore, the j retention rate of Ni/NiO/NiB@NC-500 was 84.6% of the initial value after 12 h of chronoamperometry (CA) test. The remarkable performance of Ni/NiO/NiB@NC-500 was ascribed to the following aspects: its hydrophilicity facilitated the adsorption of reactants and products, its porous spongy structure exposed more active sites for the UOR and promoted charge transfer and electrolyte diffusion, and the nitrogen-containing carbon matrix enhanced its electrical conductivity and stability. In addition, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the introduction of B significantly reduced the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) during the UOR.

TI A bridging coordination of urea tailoring metal hydroxides oxygen
   evolution catalysts promotes stable solar water splitting
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Stability is one of essential factors for evaluating the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance on photocorroded semiconductors for practical applications. Cocatalyst decoration can only maintain the stability for several hours, and organic/inorganic hybrid photoelectrodes (e.g. polymer coated photoelectrodes) also has a limited durability. Therefore, it is challenging to develop a facile but effective approach for stabilizing the photoelectrodes. In this work, we induced a handful of cheap urea into the Ni,Fe-based hydroxides as robust and conformal OECs layers, deposited on the BiVO4 photoanodes by an one-step impregnation process. Urea, an assisted nitrogen/carbon source, played an active role on the uniform growth of ultrathin OEC layer, replacing the complex organic cocatalyst. The thickness of urea induced Ni,Fe-based OEC could be modified by tuning the amount of urea, thereby improving the carrier dynamics and protecting photoelectrodes from photocorrosion. The presence of urea facilitates to deposit a homogeneous cocatalyst layer with higher electron transfer than the absence of urea, resulting in a high electrocatalytic OER and PEC performance. The optimized urea-NiFeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode showed a photocurrent density of 4.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE with impressive stability over 40 h at a potential of 0.8 V-RHE, which is one of the best PEC stabilities using NiFe-based OECs on BiVO4. Benefiting from the strong coordination bond between the metal ions and urea, the C and N elements remained stable in the OEC layer before and after PEC test. This work presents a potential application using cheap, non-precious metal based electrocatalysts to overcome the bottle-necks limiting a long-term stability of PEC water splitting.

TI Catalytic activity of Mn(III) porphyrins supported onto graphene oxide
   nano-sheets for green oxidation of sulfides
SO JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY
AB In this research, oxidation of various sulfides with urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in the presence of manganese porphyrin grafted onto graphene oxide ([Mn(THPP)OAc@GO]) in ethanol was studied. The heterogenized catalyst was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The amount of Mn-porphyrin loaded on the GO nano-sheets was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and the thermal stability of the heterogenized catalyst was investigated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). [Mn(THPP)OAc@GO] was applied for the green oxidation of different sulfides and the solid catalyst can be simply reused several times without losing its catalytic efficiency.

TI Effects of soil properties on urea-N transformation and efficacy of
   nitrification inhibitor 3, 4-dimethypyrazole phosphate (DMPP)
SO SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB Ammonia (NH3) and nitrate (NO3-) are two major sources of N loss during the urea-N transformation process in soil. 3, 4-dimethypyrazole phosphate (DMPP) is a nitrification inhibitor that could effectively limit the NO3- production process but aggravate NH3 emissions. NH3 volatilization, NO3- production and the efficiency of DMPP are all influenced by different soil factors. The objective of this study was to understand the effects of soil properties on N losses after urea application and DMPP efficacy. A laboratory incubation experiment was set up with urea applied to seven different types of soil at a rate of 0.25 g N/kg soil, with or without DMPP, (at a rate of 1% of the N applied in the fertilizer). Urea content, NH3 losses and mineral N were measured regularly for 50 days after treatment addition. NO3-N production rates, inhibition efficiencies of DMPP and urea half-lives were calculated based on the measured NO3-N and urea concentrations. Results showed that urea half-life was negatively correlated with soil total organic carbon (TOC) (r = -0.930). NO3 (-) production rate was correlated with soil pH (r = 0.670), sand (r = 0.639) and clay content (r = -0.632). The efficiency of DMPP for inhibiting NO3 (-) production was positively correlated with NO3 (-) production rate (r = 0.721). NH3 volatilization was positively correlated with soil pH (r = 0.657) and sand content (r = 0.687) and negatively correlated with urea half-life (r = -0.586). Greater inhibition efficiency of DMPP led to higher NH3 losses. Urea degradation, NH3 loss, NO3 (-) production rate and the inhibition efficiency of DMPP were significantly affected by soil properties and the risk of NH3 volatilization was increased by DMPP application.

TI Superhydrophilic Dendritic FeP/Cu3P Electrocatalyst for Urea
   Splitting via the Intramolecular Mechanism
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The electrocatalytic overall urea splitting can achieve the dual goals of urea treatment and hydrogen energy acquisition. Herein, we exploited the principle of precipitation dissolution equilibrium to obtain bimetallic phosphide FeP/Cu3P/CF for the simultaneous oxidation of urea and reduction of water and comprehensively reveal the inherent molecular thermodynamic mechanisms on the surface of catalysts. The excellent electrochemical performance can be derived from the super water affinity and synergistic effect. Especially, the theoretical calculation unveils that the synergistic effect between FeP and Cu3P can lower the activation energy required for urea electrooxidation, thereby promoting urea splitting. In situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (in situ DEMS) measurements further demonstrated that urea oxidation on FeP/Cu3P/CF proceeded according to the intramolecular mechanism. This work has laid the foundation for constructing highly efficient superhydrophilic bifunctional electrocatalysts.

TI Efficient nanointerface hybridization in a nickel/cobalt oxide nanorod
   bundle structure for urea electrolysis
SO NANOSCALE
AB Urea electrolysis has received great attention for the energy-relevant applications, and efficient nanostructured catalysts are required to overcome the sluggish urea oxidation kinetics. Herein, we noticed that the valence state of Ni in the hybrid Ni/Co oxide nanorods can be correlated to the catalytic capability for urea oxidation. Crystal lattice hybridization was found in the interface of Ni/Co oxide nanoparticles that assembled as a nanorod bundle structure. The more or the less of Ni2+/Ni3+ generated lower catalytic ability, and Ni/Co oxide with the optimum content of Ni2+/Ni3+ exhibited the highest catalytic ability for urea oxidation because of the efficient synergism, resulting from the formation of high valence state of Ni species and improved kinetics. A low onset potential of 1.29 V was required for the urea oxidation compared with the high onset potential of 1.52 V for water oxidation; high selectivity for urea oxidation was found in the potential below 1.50 V, and as a promising application for urea-assisted water electrolysis about 190 mV less was required to provide 10 mA cm(-2) in the two-electrode system, indicating the energy-efficient nature for hydrogen evolution. The study provides some novel insights into the Ni/Co catalyst design and fabrication with efficient catalytic synergism for electrocatalysis.

TI A formaldehyde-free amino resin alternative to urea-formaldehyde
   adhesives: A bio-based oxidized glucose - urea resin
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB Urea-formaldehyde resins (UF) are the most commonly used wood-based panels adhesive in industry. These adhesives are more than 80 % by volume of the wood adhesives market. However, due to formaldehyde toxicicity and extreme volatility UF resins yield panels with formaldehyde emission problem both during wood panels preparation and their in-service use. In order to address this problem, to find an environment friendly replacement for formaldehyde to manufacture novel and safe aminoresins is essential research for wood adhesives. In this article, a bio-based amino resin wood adhesive (OGU) is developed by using oxidized glucose reacted with urea. The research work presented here tests the impact on the adhesive properties of a number of oxidation treatment parameters and of the glucose to urea molar ratio. The molecular structure and thermal properties of the OGU adhesive were studied by different analytical techniques. The results indicate that the bioaldehydes are obtained by glucose under mild oxidation conditions. The bioaldehydes obtained can then be reacted with urea to form a novel oxidized glucose-urea amino resin, suitable to manufacture plywood. Under the specified process conditions at pH 4 and at a urea-to-glucose molar ratio of 1, the OGU adhesive yielded plywood with a dry strength of 0.99 MPa, 24 h cold water soaking wet strength of 0.77 MPa, and 3 h hot water (63 degrees C) soaking wet strength of 0.76 MPa. These results satisfy the requirements of the GB/T 9846-2015 standard. The OGU resin adhesive prepared has then a good market potential to replace the current UF resins used in the industrial production of wood-based panels and as a novel biomass amino resin adhesive.

TI Complementary effects between NO oxidation of DPF and NO2
   decomposition of SCR in light-duty diesel engine
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY
AB This study was conducted as part of the development process of the diesel oxidation catalyst, diesel particulate filter, and selective catalytic reduction systems of old diesel vehicles for particles and NOx reduction. While SCR plays the most important role in the reduction of NOx emissions, the contribution of the DOC and DPF cannot be ignored. The conversion, generation, and reduction of NO, NO2, and N2O emissions through DOC, DPF, and SCR were tracked for use as basic data for the development of the catalyst and control logic. The results of the experiment show that NO was converted to NO2 at over 300 degrees C by Pt catalytic oxidation reaction. The highest conversion rate appeared at 450 degrees C for DOC and at 350 degrees C for DPF. NO2 was converted to NO in the operating range of 150-300 degrees C by de-oxidation reaction. Under most operating conditions, NOx reduction efficiency in SCR was maximized when the NH3 to NOx ratio was 1, but the reduction efficiency was deteriorated by excessive NO2 conversion in DOC and DPF. In SCR, NO2 decomposition without NH3 could convert NO2 to NO, showing improved NO2 reduction efficiency under some operating conditions, where NO2 was excessively converted in DOC and DPF.

TI Simultaneous removal of SO2 and NOx from flue gas
   by wet scrubbing using a urea solution
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are major air pollutants, so simultaneously removing them from gases emitted during fossil fuel combustion in stationary systems is important. Wet denitrification using urea is used for a wide range of systems. Additives have strong effects on wet denitrification using urea, and different mechanisms are involved and different effects found using different additives. In this study, the effects of different additives, initial urea concentrations, reaction temperatures, initial pH values, gas flow rates, and reaction times on the simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification efficiencies achieved using wet denitrification using urea were studied in single factor experiment. The optimum reaction conditions for desulfurization and denitrification were found. Desulfurization and denitrification efficiencies of 97.5% and 96.3%, respectively, were achieved at a KMnO4 concentration 5mmol/L, a reaction temperature of 70 degrees C, initial urea solution pH 8, a urea concentration of 9%, and a gas flow rate of 40L/h. The concentrations of the desulfurization and denitrification reaction products in the solution were determined. NOx was mainly transformed into N-2, and the and concentrations in the solution became very low. The reactions involved in SO2 and NOx removal using urea were analyzed from the thermodynamic viewpoint. Increasing the temperature was not conducive to the reactions but increased the rate constant, so an optimum temperature was determined. The simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification kinetics were calculated. The urea consumption and , , and generation reactions were all zero order. The generation rate was greater than the generation rate. The simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification process and mechanism were studied. The results provide reference data for performing flue gas desulfurization and denitrification in factories.

TI Degradation of urea-formaldehyde resin residues by a hydrothermal
   oxidation method into recyclable small molecular organics
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin residues and the related product wastes as organic hazardous wastes are difficult to be biodegraded or recycled. In this research, a hydrothermal oxidation method using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution has been developed for the degradation and recycling of UF resin residues. The effects of solution concentration, temperature, and time on the degradation efficiency and products of UF resin residues were studied. Under optimal conditions, i.e., 140 degrees C and 5 wt% H2O2 solution, over 75% of UF resin residues was degraded after 3 h. The degradation efficiency is much higher than that of the traditional hydrothermal treatment or acid hydrolysis method. In addition, results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed that H2O2 solution degrades UF resin residues to low molecular compounds, such as alcohols, methylal, and amides. This research provides a novel and high-efficient hydrothermal oxidization process for the degradation of UF resin residues, which might be a promising environmentally friendly and low-cost method for the disposal and recycling of industrial UF resin residues.

TI Electrochemical determination of urea using a gold

SO INSTRUMENTATION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A new amperometric urea biosensor based on gold nanoparticle embedded poly(propylene-co-imidazole) was developed for the determination of urea. The urease adsorbed on the polymeric film catalyzed the hydrolysis of urea to ammonium and bicarbonate ions and the ammonium was then electrooxidized on the gold electrode with the aid of gold nanoparticles at +0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl using differential pulse voltammetry. The biosensor provided a linear current response to urea concentration from 0.1 to 30 mM, a detection limit of 36 mu M, a relative standard deviation of 2.43% (n = 18), and excellent storage stability, as the current decrease was only 3% after 75 days. The operation of the biosensor was evaluated by the analysis of municipal sewage wastewater collected from the inlet pipe of the treatment plant of Zonguldak City in Turkey. The effects of possible interferants were also characterized.

TI N2O emissions from banana plantations in tropical China as
   affected by the application rates of urea and a urease/nitrification
   inhibitor
SO BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB In this study, we quantified N2O fluxes from banana plantations in China using a field experiment as well as static chamber and gas chromatography techniques. We utilized five levels of urea treatments, including CK (no urea addition); urea addition at a rate of 312 (U1), 415 (U2), 519 (U3), and 623 kg N ha(-1) (U4); and a combination of urea (U3) and urease (NBPT) and nitrification (DCD) inhibitor (U3 + I) treatments. Soil temperature, moisture, and the concentrations of NH4 (+) and NO3 (-) have been monitored throughout the study. Compared to CK (11.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and 14.2 t ha(-1), respectively), urea addition significantly increased N2O emission fluxes and banana yields (88.2-177 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and 19.4-25.0 t ha(-1), respectively). The stimulation effect of urea on N2O emissions was significantly higher than its effect on banana yield. N2O emission occurred in pulses during banana cultivation due to repeated topdressing. The cumulative N2O emissions and N2O emission factor of urea applied in banana plantations were estimated to be 6.39-12.8 kg N ha(-1) and 1.46-2.31 %, respectively. Notably, N2O emissions were significantly positively correlated with urea application rate, temperature, and NH4 (+) levels, suggesting that temperature and NH4 (+) availability are the most important factors controlling N2O emissions in tropical banana plantations. Combined NBPT and DCD treatment greatly reduced N2O emissions (by 65.4 %) and increased banana yields (by 4.5 %).

TI Explosive Properties and Thermal Stability of Urea-Hydrogen Peroxide
   Adduct
SO PROPELLANTS EXPLOSIVES PYROTECHNICS
AB The adduct of urea and hydrogen peroxide (UHP) is industrially produced material on a large scale. Although UHP is widely used as a bleaching and oxidizing agent, its properties as energetic material are generally overlooked. In this work we report comprehensive characterization of UHP explosive and thermal properties. We found that UHP is a compound with a negative value of standard enthalpy of formation (- 565.1 kJmol(-1)). It is not sensitive to impact and friction. However, we demonstrated that UHP (1= 0.93 gcm(-3); packed into a steel pipe with inner diameter of 206 mm) detonates with experimental velocity of detonation (VOD) of 3780 ms(-1). Moreover, for UHP with maximal theoretical density (1= 1.43 gcm-3), the calculated VOD reaches 5219 ms(-1). Based on our findings, we recommend that present regulations regarding the handling, storage and transportation of the UHP should be revised, especially in cases, where UHP is kept on a large scale, under confinement and at places where the temperature can reach above 60 degrees C.

AB The presence of urea in wastewater can give rise to many issues, including the proliferation of algae as a consequence of eutrophication as well as the discharge of ammonia, which exerts a detrimental impact on aquatic organisms. To assess the efficacy of several treatment strategies for lowering urea concentrations, this study compared the removing performances of electrocoagulation (EC) with those of conducting electrocoagulation and chemical coagulation in sequence (EC-CC) or vice versa (CC-EC). Many effective parameters of electrocoagulation have been studied, such as current density, spacing between electrodes, electrolyte type, and electrolysis time. A scanning electron microscope was used to investigate the electrode morphology, and a Fourier transform infrared was conducted to analyze the formed sludge. The electrocoagulation was carried out at its optimum conditions at 30 A/m2, and the chemical coagulation was conducted using three types of iron coagulants: FeSO4, Fe2(SO4)3, and FeCl3. The results showed insufficient improvement in urea removal for synthetic and domestic wastewater via EC-CC, regardless of the coagulant type. The urea removal efficiency via EC-CC improved by less than 0.5% and 5.5% for synthetic and domestic wastewater, respectively. In contrast, CC-EC proved a better improvement for urea removal for both synthetic and domestic wastewater, but only for FeCl3. Treatment by CC-EC at 30 A/m2 for 60 min using iron electrodes and 0.5 g/L of FeCl3 resulted in an improvement in the removal efficiency of urea by about 3.4% and 10.40% for synthetic and domestic wastewater, respectively. CC-EC achieved better removal of COD from domestic wastewater than that achieved by EC-CC by 6%. The results obtained from the study indicate that the CC-EC process is a cost-effective method for removing urea from both synthetic and domestic wastewater.

TI Electrocatalytic behavior of a nanocomposite of Ni/Pd supported by
   carbonized PVA nanofibers towards formic acid, ethanol and urea
   oxidation: A physicochemical and electro-analysis study
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB A nanocomposite of Ni/Pd supported by carbonized poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers (NFs) was synthesized via electrospinning followed by calcination under an argon atmosphere. The as-synthesized NFs were studied using physicochemical analyses, such as field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), to investigate the morphology, crystallinity, effect of carbonization and surface chemistry of the NFs, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) were utilized to study the performance of the NFs towards electrooxidation reactions. The designed NFs present superior electrocatalytic behavior in an acid medium towards formic acid oxidation, as well as urea and ethanol oxidation in an alkaline medium. The electrocatalytic performance of the bimetallic NFs appears to arise from the assembly of bimetallic Ni/Pd@NFs based on PVA, which has hydroxyl groups. These hydroxyl groups can decrease the negative processes that occur as a result of metal-metal interactions, such as the aggregation process. This study introduces a novel non-precious electrocatalyst to facilitate the commercialization of fuel cells based on formic acid, urea and ethanol. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Modulating adsorption energy on nickel nitride-supported ruthenium
   nanoparticles through in-situ electrochemical activation for
   urea-assisted alkaline hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The rational design of electrocatalysts with exceptional performance and durability for hydrogen production in alkaline medium is a formidable challenge. In this study, we have developed in-situ activated ruthenium nanoparticles dispersed on Ni3N nanosheets, forming a bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and urea oxidation. The results of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of O-Ru-Ni3N stems primarily from the optimized hydrogen adsorption and hydroxyl adsorption on Ru sites. The O-Ru-Ni3N on nickel foam (NF) electrode exhibits excellent HER performance, requiring only 29 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 in an alkaline medium. Notably, when this O-Ru-Ni3N/ NF catalyst is employed for both HER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to create an integrated H2 production system, a current density of 50 mA cm-2 can be generated at the cell voltage of 1.41 V. This report introduces an energy-efficient catalyst for hydrogen production and proposes a viable strategy for anodic activation in energy chemistry.

TI Nickel-iron in the second coordination shell boost single-atomic-site
   iridium catalysts for high-performance urea electrooxidation
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high catalytic activity as well as great stability are demonstrating great promotion in electrocatalytic energy conversion, which is also a big challenge to achieve. Herein, we proposed a facile synthetic strategy to construct nickel-iron bimetallic hydroxide nanoribbon stabilized single-atom iridium catalysts (Ir-NiFe-OH), where the nickel-iron hydroxide nanoribbon not only can serve as good electronic conductor, but also can well stabilize and fully expose single-atom sites. Adopted as catalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), it exhibited excellent UOR performance that it only needed a low operated potential of 1.38 V to achieve the current density of 100 mAcm(-2). In-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectrum, and density functional theory calculations proved that Ir species are active centers and the existence of both Ni and Fe in the local structure of Ir atom can optimize the d-band center of Ir species, promoting the adsorption of intermediates and desorption of products for UOR. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/UOR electrocatalytic cell demanded voltages of 1.46 and 1.50 V to achieve 50 and 100 mAcm(-2), respectively, which demonstrated a higher activity and better stability than those of conventional catalysts. This work opens a new avenue to develop catalysts for UORs with boosted activity and stability.

TI Rational design of double perovskite La2Ni0.5Co0.5MnO6 decorated
   polyaniline array on MoO3 nanobelts with strong heterointerface boosting
   oxygen evolution reaction and urea oxidation
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The design and implementation of affordable high-performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reac-tion (OER) and urea electrooxidation reaction (UOR) are critical for clean and environmentally friendly energy conversion. Herein, we constructed a novel heterostructure interface engineering of double perovskite La2Ni0.5Co0.5MnO6 (LNCM) nanoparticles and MoO3 nanobelt array-supported amorphous polyaniline (PANI; MoO3/P) for high-performance OER and UOR. Structural and morphological analyses confirmed the formation of a heterostructure interface. The optimized La2Ni0.5Co0.5MnO6@MoO3/P (LMP-30) demonstrated electrocatalytic performance with low overpotentials of 300 mV at 10 mA cm-2 (vs RHE) for OER and 0.48 V at 50 mA cm-2 (vs Hg/HgO) for UOR, as well as better stability after testing for 12 h. The improved electrocatalytic performance was attributed to its distinctive hierarchical nanostructure, which had a synergistic effect on modulating the electrical characteristics and an electrochemically active surface area. More importantly, the LNCM nano -particles on the surface of MoO3/P nanobelts can potentially provide more electrocatalytic active sites, excellent charge transport capacity, enhanced electrical properties, and strong electronic contacts between MoO3/P and LNCM.

TI Ni, N-codoped NiMoO4 grown on 3D nickel foam as bifunctional
   electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in urea-water electrolysis
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB In this study, Ni, N-NiMoO4/NF, and other compared materials are synthesized as bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution (HER) and urea oxidation reactions (UOR). The results of characterizations and tests show that the electrocatalytic performance of Ni, N-NiMoO4/NF is higher than those of NiMoO4 center dot xH2O/NF, Ni-NiMoO4 center dot xH2O/NF, and N-NiMoO4/NF, which may be caused by the synergy between Ni, N, and NiMoO4. The introduction of N and Ni increases the wettability and adsorption of the material, which also increases the conductivity and catalytic performance of the material. Furthermore, it is found that the electrodeposition time of metallic nickel (Ni, N-NiMoO4/NF-x ( x = 10, 20, 30 min)) can affect the catalytic performances of Ni, N-NiMoO4/NF. The results show that the Ni, N-NiMoO4/NF-20 shows the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activity among all prepared samples, with 176 mV towards HER and 1.4 4 4 V towards UOR at 100 mA center dot cm -2, demonstrating its potential in a practical application as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen production in urea-water electrolysis.

TI Effects of of water content and diluent pressure on the ignition of
   aqueous ammonia/ammonium nitrate and urea/ammonium nitrate fuels
SO APPLIED ENERGY

AB Two aqueous monofuels composed of aqueous solutions of ammonia/ammonium nitrate and urea/ammonium nitrate have been suggested as feasible nitrogen-based hydrogen carriers. Such synthetic fuels can serve as long-term energy storage media, providing back-up power generation for intermittent renewable energy sources. The effects of diluents such as helium and water on the thermal behavior of these fuels are mostly unexplored. Experimental results indicated the fuels' autoignition temperature increases with diluent content due to the heat sink effect of the inert water and helium. Simulations were performed using an updated mechanism to study the reaction pathways leading to thermal autoignition. Isocyanic acid underwent hydrolysis generating NH3 and most of the CO2. Ammonia was oxidized by either NO3 or NO2 to form NH2 and either HNO3 or HONO. Nitric acid reacted with HONO producing N2O4 and most of the H2O. Molecular nitrogen was mostly produced by the termination reaction between NH2 and NO. Sensitivity analyses indicated the ignition of these fuels is promoted by the generation of NH2 from NH3 by high oxidation NO,,, and inhibited by the reduction of NO3 and NO2 to NO2 and NO, respectively. This work demonstrates for the first time the effect of aqueous ammonia/ammonium nitrate water content on its auto-ignition temperature and the crucial role of isocyanic acid hydrolysis in aqueous urea/ammonium nitrate pre-ignition pathways.

TI Catalytic oxidation of CO over CuO/CeO2 nanocomposites
   synthesized via solution combustion method: effect of fuels
SO REVIEWS ON ADVANCED MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A series of CuO/CeO2 catalysts were successfully synthesized via solution combustion method (SCS) using different fuels and tested for CO oxidation. The catalysts were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and H-2 temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR). It was found that the used fuels strongly affected the characterization and the low-temperature reduction behavior of CuO/CeO2 catalysts. The CuO/CeO2-urea catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity toward CO oxidation (t(50) =120 degrees C, t(100) =159 degrees C) than the 5 other synthesized catalysts. In addition, the CuO/CeO2-urea catalyst displayed high stability for CO oxidation during five cycles and water resistance. The enhanced catalytic CO oxidation of the synthesized samples can be attributed by a combination of factors, such as smaller crystallite size, higher specific surface area, larger amount of amorphous copper(II) oxide, more mesoporous and uniform spherical-like structure. These findings are worth considering in order to continue the study of the CuO/CeO2 catalyst with low-temperature CO oxidation.

TI Fe3O4 supported on water caltrop-derived
   biochar toward peroxymonosulfate activation for urea degradation: the
   key role of sulfate radical
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A new type of iron-doped and porous biochar (Fe@BC) derived from water mit rap was systematically investigated to catalyze the organic pollutants degradation by peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The effectiveness of this novel material was tested by treating excessive urea concentrations in swimming pool water. It exhibited good PMS activation capacity, achieving urea removal of 100% within 15 min. The Fe@BC/PMS system exhibited excellent resistance to common anions. Only chloride showed a small inhibitory effect, and the removal efficiency of urea decreased by 10% ([Cl-](0) = 10 mM). Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses demonstrated that urea degradation was mainly mediated by the radical pathway, which in turn was dominated by surface-bound sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-). Further, reusability experiments confirmed the stability of the material. After three cycles, the degradation efficiency can still reach 86%. Therefore, the conversion of water caltrop-derived biochar into a composite catalytic material provides a novel strategy for value-added utilization of aquatic waste biomass, and it is also a promising alternative for the treatment of urea from swimming pool water.

TI Catalytic Activity Evaluation of the Molten Salt-Modified Novel Ni
   Electrodes for Urea Electrooxidation in Alkaline Solutions
SO METALS
AB The presented paper characterized the molten salt-modified Ni electrode with excellent catalytic activity towards alkaline urea electrooxidation reaction. The electrodes were modified by electrodeposition of Al from molten salt electrolytes containing NaCl-KCl-AlF3 at a temperature of 750 degrees C and applied potential of -1.9 V. The porous surface was obtained by anodic polarization with a potential of -0.4 V until the anodic current was equal to 0 mAcm-2. The prepared deposits' structure, surface morphology, and composition were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Anodic polarization was applied to assess the electrocatalytic activity and elucidate the urea electrooxidation mechanism in 1 M KOH + 0.33 M urea solution. The nanocrystalline structure, fine grain size, and microcracks on the surface of the studied electrodes contributed to their notably high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The cyclic voltammetry in the non-Faradaic regions of the samples shows that molten salt modification can increase the double layer capacitance of bare Ni plates by around ten times, from 0.29 mFcm-2 to 2.16 mFcm-2. Polarization of the electrodes in urea-containing KOH solution with potential of +1.52 V shows a significant difference in catalytic performance. For the bare nickel sample, the registered current density from the urea electrooxidation reaction was around +1 mAcm-2, and for the molten salt-modified one, it was +38 mAcm-2, which indicates the fact that the molten salt surface treatment can be a promising tool in tailoring the electrochemical properties of materials.

TI A reduced model for the evaporation and decomposition of urea-water
   solution droplets
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW
AB Selective catalytic reduction with urea-water-solution is commonly used in the automotive sector to reduce nitric oxide emissions. Detailed modelling of the exhaust gas system in front of the catalyst can help in optimizing this process. Such simulations include many different physical effects and chemistry on strongly differing spatial and time scales, thus require a high amount of computational reserves. Therefore, simplified or reduced models are needed to describe some of the processes which can then be added in the overall simulation. To develop reduced models the evaporation and decomposition of a droplet of urea-water-solution and the corresponding gas phase chemistry in hot exhaust gas are analysed using detailed simulations. It is shown that the process can be separated into three main phases, namely water evaporation, urea decomposition and reactions in the gas phase, which, for the conditions considered, do not significantly couple with each other. For the first two phases a simple model is developed, which calculates the mass and energy source term for a droplet evaporation process depending only on temperature and water content of the surrounding exhaust gas and the initial diameter of the droplet. The time scales and entropy production of the gas phase chemistry are determined for typical gas mixture compositions and initial conditions and based on these results a skeletal mechanism for chemical kinetics is generated. It can describe the gas phase chemistry for temperatures up to 800 K. In addition, it is found that gas phase chemistry at temperatures up to 1000 K can be modelled without the need to resolve the boundary layer of the small droplets.

TI Magnesium substituted cobalt spinel nanostructures for electrocatalytic
   water oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB Two MgCo2O4 nanostructures in different morphologies have been synthesized by using two different structure-directing agents (urea (U) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)) as new catalysts for water oxidation reactions. The properties of these nanostructures were discovered and characterized by a combination of analytical techniques, being TEM, SEM, EDX, XRD, XPS, and BET. While the urea-stabilized MgCo2O4 (U-MgCo2O4) nanostructures have spiky morphology, the NTA-stabilized ones (NTA-MgCo2O4) have wire-like structures. The synthesized nanostructures were utilized to modify glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs), and the electrochemical activities of the modified electrodes in water oxidation reactions were investigated in an alkaline medium by recording linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs). Even though both modified GCEs had almost the same onset potentials (1.67V vs. RHE for U-MgCo2O4/GCE and 1.63V vs. RHE for NTA-MgCo2O4/GCE), NTA-MgCo2O4/GCE required a lower overpotential (463mV vs. 573mV) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) catalytic current density. Besides being catalytically more active than U-MgCo2O4/GCE, NTA-MgCo2O4/GCE was also found to be more stable in constant potential electrolysis. Moreover, it demonstrated a comparable performance to that of RuO2 and has the advantage of being significantly economic.

TI Study on efficient removal of SOx and NOx from marine exhaust gas by wet
   scrubbing method using urea peroxide solution
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Marine exhaust gas is seriously harmful to the environment, and only using a single pollutant treatment device is difficult to meet the emission regulations. It is imperative to study integrated and efficient marine exhaust gas pollutant removal technology. This study proposes a novel process capable of removing NOx and SOx in marine exhaust gas, and this process can achieve higher NOx and SOx removal efficiency and lower nitrate concentration by using urea peroxide (CO(NH2)(2)center dot H2O2) combined with a countercurrent scrubber. The effects of reaction temperature, urea peroxide concentration, liquid-gas ratio (L/G), SO2 concentration and urea concentration in urea peroxide solutions on NO removal were investigated. The results showed that the temperature and liquid-gas ratio played the key role at a fixed urea peroxide concentration, and the NOx removal efficiency increased with the increase of temperature (from 23 degrees C to 80 degrees C) and liquid-gas ratio (from 2 L/m(3) to 6 L/m(3)). The NO removal efficiency of urea peroxide solution was really higher than that of mixed solution of urea and hydrogen peroxide. The NO removal efficiency can reach above 90% with proper operating parameters. The larger liquid-gas ratio can make the urea peroxide concentration decrease, and the NO removal efficiency still met the emission regulation. The use of onefold urea peroxide can not only achieve higher SOx and NOx removal efficiency, but keep lower nitrate concentration. This novel process can be applied in ships combined with exhaust gas cleaning (EGC) system.

TI Urea fuel cell using cow dung compost soil as a novel biocatalyst for
   power generation applications
SO ENERGY
AB This paper shows use of cow dung compost soil as a biocatalyst to optimize the urea fuel concentrations in the range of 0.1 g/ml to 0.5 g/ml in cow dung compost microbial fuel cells (CC-MFCs). The results indicate that the CC-MFC with the urea fuel concentration of 0.4 g/ml produces the maximum power. Moreover, the bacterial population plays a vital role in electricity generation. For constant cell operation and cell sustainability, it must be refuelled with the catalyst after every 12 h cycle and the max power density was generated 17.84mW/m(2) by CC-MFC. This study confirms for the first time that cow dung compost directly works as a noval biocatalyst. Here primary focus is to generate power through soil processes using urea-rich wastewaters (urine) as fuel. CC-MFCs are inexpensive, non-toxic, leakage proof, low maintenance, less labour intensive, durable, stable, easily disposable, sustainable, and efficient. Moreover, these fuel cells can generate clean energy without biocatalyst deactivation. Research is going on fabrication and development of CC-MFC for application depend upon the type of urea rich urine wastewater used as fuel for power generation and cleaning the environment.

TI Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Urea at CuOx-NiOx
   Nanoparticle-Based Binary Catalyst Modified Polyaniline/GC Electrodes
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB In this study glassy carbon (GC) electrodes modified with electropolymerized polyaniline (PANI) are functionalized by the electrodeposition of copper oxide (CuOx) and nickel oxide (NiOx) nanoparticles (NPs). The proposed binary modified GC electrodes are suggested as effective and stable electrocatalysts towards urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The proposed electrodes were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and mapping EDX. The electrochemical characterization, electrocatalytic activity, and catalyst' durability of the as-prepared anodes were tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry (CA). The loading of PANI and the catalyst' deposition sequence were optimized. The modified electrode with PANI followed by electrodeposition of CuOx and NiOx showed higher electroactivity than without PAM, i.e., it increases by about four times for UOR simultaneously with a negative shift by 40 mV of the onset potential of UOR. Furthermore, the modified PAM fibers with electrodeposition of CuOx and NiOx, where CuOx is the top one, displayed the leading electrocatalytic stability and activity for UOR. The addressed electrode (NiOx/CuOx/PANI/GC) has a low cost, good selectivity and sensitivity, fast response, and high stability. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

TI Visible light promoted aerobic selective photo-oxidation of cyclohexene
   on LaCoxCu1-xO3 catalyst
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Heterogeneously catalyzed liquid oxidation of olefins with O-2 provides an alternative way for synthesizing high-value added chemicals. Herein, we report a straightforward urea-redox and sol-gel process for synthesizing LaCoxCu1-xO3 for aerobic photo-oxidation of cyclohexene. Our research highlights a marked increase in the proportions of Co2+ and Cu+ species in a low chemical state, as well as enhanced visible light absorption through this method. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the catalytic process, particularly with LaCo0.7Cu0.3O3, involves a radical pathway mediated by reactive oxygen species. The presence of Cu+/Co2+ species and surface oxygen vacancies is proposed to boost O-2 adsorption and activation on the catalyst, facilitating the formation of 2-cyclohexene-1-hydroperoxides. Furthermore, Cu2+/Co3+ species are thought to aid in generating cyclohexene-derived radical species. The efficient aerobic oxidation of cyclohexene on LaCo0.7Cu0.3O3 catalyst relies on the formation of reactive oxygen species and carbon radicals, facilitated by its strong visible light illumination. It achieves a cyclohexene conversion of 89.4% and selectivity to cyclohex-2-ene-1-one of 72.2%, along with stable recyclability after six reuses. The creation of nano-structured LaCoxCu1-xO3 through the urea-redox and sol-gel process offers a promising avenue for the development of highly efficient catalysts for the aerobic photo-oxidation of cyclohexene to cyclohex-2-ene-1-one in the future.

TI Self-supported nanoporous Zn-Ni-Co/Cu selenides microball arrays for
   hybrid energy storage and electrocatalytic water/urea splitting
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The phase-pure multiple ternary or quaternary metal selenides in energy boosting, have not been reported yet. Here, self-supported porous crystalline Zn-Ni-Co/Cu selenides microballs arrays were constructed by selenation of the designed tubular Cu(OH)(2) arrays decorated with ultrathin Zn-Co-Ni tri-metallic hydroxide on carbon cloth substrate. For this rational engineering, a novel precursor sample was firstly prepared by conversion of deposited Cu layer to hollow tubular Cu(OH)(2) arrays on carbon cloth, then, Zn-Co-Ni layered ternary hydroxides with a thin layer structure was deposited around this tubular arrays. The selenation with an exciting morphology change from amorphous tube to highly crystalline microballs lead to the advanced electrode materials that successfully combine the desired merits such as high conductivity, large specific surface areas, and multiple redox and electrocatalytic active sites for asymmetric supercapacitors, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) applications. Interestingly, the Zn-Ni-Co/Cu microballs selenide does not demonstrate striking capacitive behaviors, when evaluated as a battery-type material for electrochemical energy storage (ESs) with the maximum capacity reaching as high as 884.6 C g(-1) (or 2211.5 F g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1) and excellent rate capability. But it exhibits competitive OER and UOR electrocatalytic performances with excellent stability, which requires a low potential of 0.312 V (vs. AgCl) to drive 100 mA cm(-2) in UOR and remarkable catalytic current of 325 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs. RHE for OER in alkaline solutions, which superior than that of the reported metal selenides or oxides materials up to date.

TI Engineering CoN/Ni(OH) 2 heterostructures with improved intrinsic
   interfacial charge transfer toward simultaneous hydrogen generation and
   urea-rich wastewater purification
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Exploring cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for simultaneous hydrogen production and environment purification is of great charm. Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalyst is designed by integrating cobalt nitride (CoN) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) on nickel foam. The generated CoN/Ni(OH)2 heterostructures are comprised of the CoN (111) and Ni(OH)2 (001) with the 2.8% low lattice mismatch, in which the polar plane of CoN (111) is beneficial for the charge transfer between interfaces, guaranteeing the excellent properties toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). For alkaline HER, the optimal electrocatalyst delivers the superior activity with a small overpotential of 40 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec1. Furthermore, an excellent UOR performance is also achieved (1.39 V@50 mA cm-2, 64 mV dec-1). Based on the superior HER and UOR electrocatalytic activities, the assembled electrolytic cell by integrating two optimal NF/CNNH electrodes as the anode and cathode can drive the current density of 10 mA cm-2 with the small cell voltage of 1.43 V and possess good stability. Our work may provide a valuable way for designing bifunctional electrocatalysts for both efficient energy-saving hydrogen generation and urea-rich wastewater purification.

TI Ca-assisted nitrogen-rich molecular approach for the synthesis of
   monodisperse tantalum oxide and (oxy) nitride nanocrystals for visible
   light-induced water oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF THE CERAMIC SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB The visible-light-induced photocatalytic water oxidation activity without cocatalyst has been demonstrated for the first time on tantalum (oxy) nitride nanocrystals synthesized by a Ca-assisted nitrogen-rich molecular approach. Monodisperse TaON and Ta3N5 nanocrystals were synthesized by using suitable urea/Ta ratios in the presence of Ca2+ ions. The as-synthesized (oxy) nitrides are in the form of spherically-shaped and well-defined nanocrystals with an average diameter of ca. 7 nm. Both nanocrystals showed absorption edges in the visible region. The band gap energies of TaON and Ta3N5 nanocrystals were determined from the Tauc's plots of the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra to be 2.27 and 2.08 eV for indirect allowed transitions, respectively. The O-2 evolution rate was increased and reached the maximum in the following order: 2.01, 3.32, and 4.66 mu mol.h(-1) for the samples synthesized with Ca2+/urea molar ratio of 0.10, 0.50, and 0.25, respectively, due to the decrease in the optical band gap.

TI SUPERCRITICAL WATER OXIDATION (SCWO) OF FORMALDEHYDE WASTEWATER
SO OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS
AB Formaldehyde wastewater would destroy ecological system and influence human health when discharging the wastewater into the water body. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) and catalytic supercritical water oxidation (CSCWO) of formaldehyde wastewater were investigated. A higher amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD) can be removed using the SCWO process. K2CO3 addition markedly improved COD removal. Biology oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand (BOD5/COD) ratio is 0.56 after the formaldehyde wastewater is treated. It was concluded that CSCWO was far more effective for treating formaldehyde wastewater.

TI Use of Visible Light Modulation Techniques in Urea Photocatalytic
   Degradation
SO WATER
AB The aim of this work was to analyze the effect of visible LED dimming duty-cycle modulation techniques in a photocatalytic system for urea degradation using a visible light photocatalyst immobilized on macroscopic supports. For this reason, the effect of different LED dimming techniques was investigated and compared in terms of urea degradation together with ammonia and nitrate production during the irradiation time. The experimental results evidenced that using a visible LED dimming modulation with variable-peak variable-duty pulse-width modulation (PWM) allows to improve the photocatalytic degradation process, with respect to classical LED dimming with fixed-peak fixed-duty PWM, and influences the product's distribution of ammonia and nitrate in water. Therefore, the proof of concept herein proposed could be considered as preliminary potential results to be used in water recycling applications with a particular emphasis in recovery of urea photodegradation byproducts, such as ammonia, from wastewater that could be used as potential resources and an energy resource.

TI Nickel-Based Hollow Spheres with Optimized Interfacial Electronic
   Structures by Highly Dispersed MoN for Efficient Urea Electrolysis
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Ni-Mo-based catalysts that exhibit well-synergized and readily accessible catalytic sites are ideal catalysts for achieving efficient electrocatalysis. Herein, the synthesis of hollow Ni spheres with a hierarchical nanosheet surface modified by highly dispersed MoN for efficient urea electrolysis is reported. This synthesis is based on the design of hollow Mo-Ni precursors featuring a nanosheet array surface, achieved through the phosphomolybdic acid (PMo12)-mediated reconstruction of hollow Ni-BTC spheres. The optimized MoN-Ni catalyst can effectively drive both the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction at low potentials of 1.37 V and 191 mV, respectively, achieving a current density of 100 mA cm-2. The electrolytic cell utilizing these catalysts can sustain 100 mA cm-2 at a low voltage of 1.53 V and can operate continuously for over 220 h. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) analyses demonstrate the established built-in electric field facilitates electron transfer from MoN to Ni, optimizing the d-band center and consequently reducing the reaction barrier for the UOR. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses indicate that MoN promotes the formation of high-valent Ni sites, which accelerates the UOR and facilitates the urea eletrolysis through a more environmentally friendly "carbonate" pathway.

TI The synergetic effect of the mixed phase of NiMoO4 with a
   1D-2D-3D hierarchical structure for a highly efficient and stable urea
   oxidation reaction
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Using a urea oxidation reaction (UOR) instead of an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is regarded as an effective method for reducing the required hydrogen potential and overall energy costs. Nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) is considered as an efficient UOR catalyst, and its crystalline phase plays a pivotal role in improving the UOR activity. However, a deep understanding of the relevant mechanism of the NiMoO4 phase remains largely ambiguous. Herein, a mixed phase (alpha/beta) of the NiMoO4@NF electrode with a 1D-2D-3D hierarchical structure is fabricated using a facile solvothermal strategy. This unique 1D-2D-3D hierarchical structure is conducive to exposing more abundant active sites. The experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations jointly demonstrate that alpha/beta-NiMoO4 can bring "1 + 1 > 2" multiphase synergetic effects, higher conductivity and lower adsorption energy of urea molecules, which is beneficial for improving the UOR performance. Consequently, the alpha/beta-NiMoO4@NF electrode exhibits a decent UOR activity, i.e., at a potential of 1.36 V to reach 100 mA cm(-2), about 315 mV less than that of the OER. This study provides a promising method for energy conservation and treatment of urea-containing wastewater.

TI Electrooxidation Performance of a Cotton-Cloth-Derived, Ni-Based, Hollow
   Microtubular Weave Catalytic Electrode for Methanol and Urea
SO METALS
AB Increasing consumption produces a large amount of cotton textile waste, the conversion of which into porous metals used for energy purposes is of practical value. In this paper, a porous, Ni-based, hollow microtubular weave (Ni-HTW) is obtained from cotton weave by high-temperature carbonization and hydrothermal synthesis with high-temperature reduction. The Ni-based, hollow microtubules in this weave have a diameter of 5-10 mu m and a wall thickness of about 1 mu m, and every 15 microtubules form a loose bundle with a diameter of 150-200 mu m. For improved performance, Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are further electrodeposited on the fibers' surface of the Ni-HTW to form a nano-Ni(OH)(2)/Ni-HTW composite electrode with a core-shell heterostructure where Ni is the core and Ni(OH)(2) the shell. The combination of hollow microtubule weave morphology and nanosheet structure results in a large specific surface area and abundant active sites, and the composite electrode shows excellent electrocatalytic performance and long-term stability for methanol oxidation (MOR) and urea oxidation (UOR). The current densities can reach 303.1 mA/cm(2) and 342.5 mA/cm(2) at 0.8 V, and 92.29% (MOR) and 84.41% (UOR) of the pre-cycle current densities can be maintained after 2000 consecutive cycles.

TI Heterostructured Nickel-Cobalt Selenide Immobilized onto Porous Carbon
   Frameworks as an Advanced Anode Material for Urea Electrocatalysis
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Transition-metal selenides based materials have recently aroused an increasing consideration in the field of energy reservation and conversion owing to their good electrochemical performance and low synthetic cost. Herein, multi-walled carbon nanotubes supported binary nickel cobalt selenide composite (Ni-Co-Se/CNT) was prepared by a one-pot-hydrothermal method using hydrazine ions that enables the selenium to diffuse and react with the Ni-and Co-cations to form Ni-Co-Se with a stable nanostructure onto the outer walls of the CNT platforms due to the coordination interaction between the metallic cations and surface oxygen-containing group of the conductive scaffolds. The electrochemical performances for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are accessed in an alkaline medium by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CA), and electrochemical impedancespectroscopy (EIS) tests. The as-prepared Ni-Co-Se/CNT hybrid presents an excellent electrocatalytic activity in terms of current density and onset potential due to synergistic effects of tubular CNT scaffolds, additional Co active sites, and electrochemically active NiOOH layer. The CNTs support markedly enhanced the electrocatalytic properties by providing a rapid mass transport for UOR because of their porous network architectures with a robust adhesion to the Ni-Co-Se nanocrystals. Thus, the synthetic methodology synthetic methodology adopted here is entirely effective for constructing various metal selenide compounds in future.

SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB A novel g-C3N4/VC composite was prepared by adopting simple hydrothermal treatment without using any additives from bulk g-C3N4 and Vulcan XC-72R (VC) in different ratios. Further, the resulting composite materials were used as a support for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs. The use of g-C3N4/VC not only acts as a support for the Cu2O NPs but also it forms a new type of novel composite materials, i.e., Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC. Various ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 2:1) of g-C3N4 and VC were used for the synthesis of three different types of the composite materials such as Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC(1:1), Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC(1:2), and Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC(2:1). The structures, surface properties, elemental compositions, and morphologies of synthesized materials were analyzed by various instrument methods such as FTIR, XRD, FESEM, Raman, EDS, BET, etc. Then the electrochemical activity of those resulting Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC composite materials were examined towards urea oxidation. The catalytic activity of Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC composite materials were found to be influenced by the variation of the g-C3N4 to VC ratio. The Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC(1:2) composite presented a higher current density (25.3 mAcm(-2)) as compared to that of Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC(1:1) (21.2 mAcm(-2)) and Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC(2:1) (13.5 mAcm(-2)) at 0.6 V using 2 M urea. The observed higher catalytic activity of this Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC (1:2) composite material compared to Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC (1:1) and Cu2O-g-C3N4/VC (2:1) is due to its higher surface area arising from different morphology compared to that of others. The Chronoamperometric measurements of the composite materials demonstrated their high stability upto 2 h without any degradation in the current density.

TI iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis of Sprague-Dawley rats
   liver reveals perfluorooctanoic acid-induced lipid metabolism and urea
   cycle dysfunction
SO TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a typical C8 representative compound of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) widely used in industrial and domestic products. It is a persistent organic pollutant found in the environment as well as in the tissues of humans and wildlife. Despite emerging scientific and public interest, the precise mechanisms of PFOA toxicity remain unclear. In this study, male rats were exposed to 1.25, 5, and 20 mg PFOA/kg body weight/day for 14 days by gavage; food intake and bodyweight changes were recorded every day. After 14 days, blood was collected for sera biochemistry, livers were quickly stripped and weighed after execution. Part of the liver tissue was frozen by liquid nitrogen for iTRAQ-Based Quantitative Proteomics Analysis; and some was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for histological section and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Urine samples were also collected and monitored by raising rats in metabolic cages. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blot was used to validate the proteomics assay after bioinformatics analysis. The results demonstrate that 20 mg/kg/d PFOA exposure cause body weight loss and significant liver swelling and reduced urea metabolism. The sera biochemistry assay shows that ALT, GGT, BILD and UREA levels have significant changes compared with normal control group and reference range of rat sera. The subsequent iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis of rat livers identified 3,327 non-redundant proteins of which 112 proteins were significantly upregulated and 80 proteins were downregulated. Gene ontology analysis revealed proteins are primarily involved in cellular, metabolic and single-organism processes. Among them, eight proteins (ACOX1, ACOX2, ACOX3, ACSL1, EHHADH, GOT2, MTOR and ACAA1) were related to oxidation of fatty acids and two proteins (ASS1 and CPS1) were found to be associated with urea cycle disorder. The downregulation of urea synthesis proteins ASS1 and CPS1 after exposure to PFOA was then confirmed through qPCR and western blot analysis. Together, these data demonstrate that PFOA exposure directly influences urea metabolism and provides insight into specific mechanisms of hepatotoxicity as a result of PFOA exposure.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Rational design of NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays on
   nickle foam as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts toward urea
   electrooxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A 3D NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays directly grown on Ni foam electrode (NiCo2S4/NF) is prepared by two-step simple hydrothermal process. The morphology and phase composition of NiCo2S4/NF are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As expected, in the following electrocatalytic measurement, the binder-free, self-made NiCo2S4/NF electrode exhibits much higher catalytic activity, lower onset potential, better stability and greater tolerance towards urea electrooxidation compared with the Ni3S2/NF electrode synthesized under the same reaction conditions. The NiCo2S4/NF electrode delivers a current density of 720 mA cm(-2) at 0.18 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a solution containing 5 mol L-1 KOH and 0.33 mol L-1 urea. The impressive electrocatalytic activity of the NiCo2S4/NF catalyst is largely ascribed to its distinctive structure, which exposes more electrochemical active sites at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Besides, the high intrinsic electronic conductivity also largely boosts the charge transfer rates for urea electrooxidation. The results demonstrate that the NiCo2S4/NF electrode showing a beneficial application prospect in the wastewater treatment and direct urea fuel cells.

TI Compositional and electronic reconstruction to co-incorporated
   NiOSO4-NiMoO4 for boosting electrocatalytic
   overall water splitting/ overall urea splitting reactions
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Herein, we grew in situ Co-incorporated NiOSO4-NiMoO4 4 -NiMoO 4 heterostructures on nickel foam (Co-NiSMoO/NF). The introduction of S 2- and MoO42- 4 2- into CoNi-ZIF precursor leads to the compositional and electronic reconstruction, resulting in the Co-NiSMoO/NF nanostructures. The attractive features in the morphology, composition, and electronic structure cooperatively endow them with high electrocatalytic performances. As a result, the CoNiSMoO/NF nanostructures exhibit superior electrocatalytic performances to oxygen evolution, urea oxidation, and thus overall water/urea splitting reactions (OER/UOR/OWS/OUS). Specifically, the Co-NiSMoO/NF shows a high electrocatalytic OER activity, with low overpotentials of 172 mV@10 mA cm- 2 , 238 mV@20 mA cm-- 2 , 278 mV@50 mA cm-- 2 , 308 mV@100 mA cm- 2 in alkaline. For UOR, the overpotential is just as low as 1.318 V@10 mA cm-- 2 , 1.330 V@20 mA cm-- 2 , 1.346 V@50 mA cm-- 2 , and 1.401 V@100 mA cm-- 2 . Especially, the voltage of the record cell even drops to 1.446 V@10 mA cm-- 2 to OUS. Furthermore, the Co-NiSMoO/NF electrocatalysts still stable to OER, UOR, and OUS even for up to 100 h. More importantly, we also realized H2 2 production in a green manner driven by solar. Under solar illumination on a solar panel, H2 2 production speed is even as high as 408 L h- 1 m- 2 .

TI Interconnected phosphorus-doped CoO-nanoparticles nanotube with
   three-dimensional accessible surface enables high-performance
   electrochemical oxidation
SO NANO ENERGY
AB The ability to create nanomaterials with hollow micro- or nanostructures renders their applications in fields such as catalysis, controlled delivery and lightweight composites. Herein, we report a simple three-step route to Cu2O/Cu nanotubes populated by interconnected, phosphorus-doped CoO nanoparticles (denoted P-CoO-Cu2O/Cu-NTs). They possess three-dimensional (3D) accessible surface, thereby greatly favoring the exposure of active sites and electrolyte transport for efficient electrocatalysis. Notably, the integrated electrochemical tests and theoretical calculation reveal that the P-doping imparts the optimization of the electronic structures of CoO, enhancing its conductivity, facilitating the in-situ formation of active CoOOH species during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and suitably regulating free energy for adsorption of the OER intermediates. Consequently, the P-CoO-Cu2O/Cu-NTs exhibit outstanding performance for OER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with the overpotential of 261 mV and potential of 1.43 V vs RHE, respectively, at 10 mA em(-2), outperforming most of non-precious metal electrocatalysts and RuO2. As such, the three-step approach involving the use of Cu nano-wires as template to yield Cu2O/Cu nanotubular yet porous scaffold may stand out as a robust strategy for judicious crafting of interconnected hetematom-doped metal oxides for high-performance electrocatalysis.

TI Comparative study of the removal of urea by electrocoagulation and
   electrocoagulation combined with chemical coagulation in aqueous
   effluents
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Urea is a major issue in human wastewater because it may be easily broken down by the urease enzyme produced by bacteria, leading to ammonia production. Due to its ability to increase soil pH and eutrophicate streams, ammonia-containing effluent emissions pose environmental and health risks. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatment approaches in reducing urea concentrations by comparing the removal rates of conducting electrocoagulation (EC), EC followed by chemical coagulation (EC-CC), and CC followed by electrocoagulation (EC-CC). Numerous electrocoagulation parameters have been investigated, including current density, electrode gap distance, electrolyte type, concentration, and electrolysis duration. The electrode morphology was examined using a scanning electron microscope, while the produced sludge was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Three kinds of aluminum coagulants-potash alum, aluminum sulfate, and aluminum chloride-were used in the chemical coagulation, while the electrocoagulation was optimized at 30 A/m2. The results of this investigation suggest that the application of EC-CC, regardless of the type of coagulant used in both synthetic and real effluent, could marginally improve the efficacy of urea removal. Conversely, CC-EC exhibits an adverse effect on the efficiency of urea removal in both synthetic and real wastewater. The application of CC-EC demonstrated a significant improvement in the effectiveness of COD removal from actual wastewater, according to experimental results. The study emphasized the effectiveness and economic advantages of electrocoagulation over EC-CC and CC-EC techniques, used to remove urea from both real and synthetic wastewater.

TI Salen copper(II) complex heterogenized on mesoporous MCM-41 as
   nano-reactor catalyst for the selective oxidation of sulfides using urea
   hydrogen peroxide (UHP)
SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB MCM-41 silica spheres were synthesized and functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (3-APTES). The Schiff base has been derived from amino groups and 5-boromo salicylaldehyde, then a tetra dentate Cu(II)-Schiff base complex was prepared. This compound was characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, UV-Vis spectrometer, transmission electron micrographys (TEM), IR-spectra, and TGA/DTA technique. The prepared grafting Cu-salen-MCM-41 over a mesoporous surface was found to be an efficient and selective catalyst for the oxidation of different sulfides into sulfoxides with urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) giving excellent yields at room temperature. The results showed that Cu-salen-MCM-41 is an effective catalyst for the oxidation of sulfides and can be repeatedly used and regenerated with no significant decrease in its catalytic ability. They also showed that the prepared material retained a good mesoporous structure and the best catalytic properties.

SO PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS
AB In the present study, linseed oil based alkyd resin and linseed oil have been encapsulated to propose the alkyd resin as a prospective material for being used in epoxy coating system for corrosion protection through self-healing.
   The superiority of the present systems as Linseed oil and its alkyd resin evolves from the utilization of the environmentally friendliness thanks to their film formation by auto-oxidation. The encapsulation of healing agents by means of in-situ polymerization of urea formaldehyde has been studied with the parameters as the amount of surfactant and the rate of stirring. The experimental design has been modeled by using Response Surface Method to investigate the effect of surfactant (poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA) amount and stirring rate effect on the microcapsules (MC) size. Optical microscopy has been utilized to follow the reaction and size change of MCs. The chemical structure, thermal properties and capsule morphology has been illuminated by using FTIR spectroscopy, TGA and SEM analysis, respectively. The capsules obtained have had 51 and 56 tun diameter at high levels of the parameters (60 ml PVA, 1500 rpm stirring rate) and 97 and 261 pm diameter at low levels of the parameters (20 ml PVA, 800 rpm stirring rate) for LO and LO-Alkyd respectively.

TI Nickel-Rhodium bimetallic dispersions supported on nickel foam as the
   efficient catalyst for urea electrooxidation in alkaline medium
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The nickel-rhodium bimetallic dispersions supported on nickel foam (Ni-Rh/Ni foam) are prepared by the hydrogen-bubble templated electrodeposition of nickel on nickel foam (Ni/Ni foam) and the subsequent electrodeposition of rhodium on Ni/Ni foam. The physicochemical characterizations including FESEM, XRD, XPS and ICP show the Ni-Rh/Ni foam electrode owns highly porous structure and uniform unalloyed Ni-Rh dispersions, and loads minute amount of Rh (0.467 mg cm(-2)). By modulating the Rh electrodeposition time to 50 min, the Ni-Rh/Ni foam electrode exhibits the highest catalytic current density for urea electrooxidation and the most delayed oxygen evolution reaction. From the quadrant position of the Nyquist plots, the Rh component in Ni-Rh/Ni foam is found to exert no apparent effect on the anti-poisoning of intermediate (adsorbed CO2). Instead, Rh facilitates the formation of Ni(OH)(2), which contributes to the boost in the catalytic activity of Ni-Rh/Ni foam over Ni/Ni foam. This work suggests the Ni-Rh/Ni foam electrode is a promising anode catalyst for the urea electrooxidation-assisted hydrogen production and the simultaneous urea-containing sewage disposal.

TI Size Fractionation of Two-Dimensional Sub-Nanometer Thin Manganese
   Dioxide Crystals towards Superior Urea Electrocatalytic Conversion
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB A universal technique has been proposed to sort two-dimensional (2D) sub-nanometer thin crystals (manganese dioxide MnO2 and molybdenum disulfide MoS2) according to their lateral dimensions. This technique is based on tuning the zeta potential of their aqueous dispersions which induces the selective sedimentation of large-sized 2D crystals and leaves the small-sized counterparts in suspension. The electrocatalytic properties of as-obtained 2D ultrathin crystals are strongly dependent on their lateral size. As a proof-of-concept study, the small-sized MnO2 nanocrystals were tested as the electrocatalysts for the urea-oxidation reaction (UOR), which showed outstanding performance in both half reaction and full electrolytic cell. A mechanism study reveals the enhanced performance is associated with the remarkable structural properties of MnO2 including ultrathin (ca. 0.95nm), laterally small-sized (50-200nm), and highly exposed active centers.

TI Electrocatalytic urea mineralization in aqueous alkaline medium using
   Ni<SUP>II</SUP> cyclam-modified nanoparticulate TiO2 anodes
   and its relationship with the simultaneous electrogeneration of
   H2 on Pt counterelectrodes
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Ni(II)cyclam-modified nanoparticulate TiO2-coated ITO electrodes (ITO/TiO2//Ni-II-cyclam) were prepared by electropolymerization of Ni(II)cyclam monomers to TiO2-coated ITO electrodes (ITO/TiO2) to improve electrocatalytic urea CO(NH2)(2) oxidation in alkaline aqueous solutions. A high value adding secondary effect was the collection of electrons at Pt cathodes, to simultaneously generate H-2 from water reduction. Ni(II)cyclam-modified ITO electrodes (ITO//Ni-II-cyclam) were also prepared by electropolymerization of Ni(II)cyclam monomers to bare ITO electrodes (ITO) for comparison purposes. In the presence of the TiO2 nanoparticles, the urea mineralization on Ni(II)cyclam coatings was doubled (23.95% - organic carbon removal at 120 min of electrolysis) compared to those without TiO2 nanoparticles (13.02% - organic carbon removal at 120 min of electrolysis).
   In agreement, the faradaic efficiency for H-2 generation at the Pt cathode, electrically connected to an anode having TiO2 nanoparticles (0.99 at 120 min of electrolysis), was also twice as effective than that observed when the same Pt cathode was electrically connected to an anode without TiO2 nanoparticles (0.46 at 120 min of electrolysis). The experimental results indicated that the poisoning of Ni-II centers (which is caused by an excessive production of CO intermediates during the urea oxidation on both Ni(II)cyclam-modified anodes) was strongly inhibited in the presence of the nanoparticulate TiO2 vertical bar Ni(II)cyclam junction.
   A final comparison between our results and those reported in selected publications revealed that the Ni(II)cyclam-modified nanoparticulate TiO2-coated ITO anodes here developed, constitutes a promising electrocatalytic system for performing direct urea mineralization at a relative short electrolysis time. Furthermore, the combination of the following phenomena: (a) effective charge separation on the semiconducting ITO vertical bar nanoparticulate TiO2 junctions, (b) remarkable capabilities of the nanoporous TiO2 films for tuning the load of OH- anions demanded by the urea oxidation and, (c) outstanding capabilities of the TiO2 nanoparticles for capturing CO intermediates (at Ti3+ donor sites), successfully promoted the enhancement of the electron external transport to Pt cathodes, and consequently improved the faradaic efficiency associated to the cathodic generation of H-2.

   high-performance urea electrooxidation
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In recent years, electric oxidation of urea has become an effective method to treat wastewater. Non-noble nickel-based catalyst is a kind of urea oxidation catalyst. Therefore, monodisperse Ni0.85Se/rGO nano-crystals on rGO (Ni0.85Se/rGO) was prepared by reflux and pyrolysis, and the physical properties of Ni0.85Se/rGO were characterized, moreover, the electrooxidation performance of urea was tested in 1 M KOH/0.5 M Urea solution. It turns out that Ni0.85Se/rGO is an inexpensive, high-efficiency and durable catalyst for UOR with potential of 1.36 V vs. RHE (corresponding to 10 mA cm(-2)). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI Defective Black TiO2: Effects of Annealing Atmospheres and
   Urea Addition on the Properties and Photocatalytic Activities
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB A series of black TiO2 with and without the addition of urea were successfully prepared using a simple one-step synthetic method by calcination under different atmospheres (vacuum, He, or N-2). The physicochemical, optical, and light-induced charge transfer properties of the as-prepared samples were characterized by various techniques. It was found that a vacuum atmosphere was more beneficial for the formation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) than the inert gases (He and N-2) and the addition of urea-inhibited OVs formation. The samples annealed in the vacuum condition exhibited better visible-light adsorption abilities, narrower bandgaps, higher photo-induced charge separation efficiency, and lower recombination rates. Hydroxyl radicals (.OH) were the dominant oxidative species in the samples annealed under a vacuum. Finally, the samples annealed under vacuum conditions displayed higher photocatalytic activity for methylene blue (MB) degradation than the samples annealed under He or N-2. Based on the above, this study provides new insights into the effects of annealing atmospheres and urea addition on the properties of black TiO2.

TI Hollow NiMo-based nitride heterojunction with super-hydrophilic/
   aerophobic surface for efficient urea-assisted hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are key reactions of the watercycling associated catalytic process/device. The design of catalysts with a super-hydrophilic/aerophobic structure and optimized electron distribution holds great promise. Here, we have designed a threedimensional (3D) hollow Ni/NiMoN hierarchical structure with arrayed-sheet surface based on a onepot hydrothermal route for efficient urea-assisted HER based on a simple hydrothermal process. The Ni/NiMoN catalyst exhibits super-hydrophilic/aerophobic properties with a small droplet contact angle of 6.07 degrees and an underwater bubble contact angle of 155.7 degrees, thus facilitating an escape of bubbles from the electrodes. Density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate the optimized electronic structure at the interface of Ni and NiMoN, which can promote the adsorption/desorption of reactants and intermediates. The virtues combining with a large specific surface area endow Ni/NiMoN with efficient catalytic activity of low potentials of 25 mV for HER and 1.33 V for UOR at 10 mA cmz. The coupled HER and UOR system demonstrates a low cell voltage of 1.42 V at 10 mA cm -2, which is approximately 209 mV lower than water electrolysis.

TI Tailoring porous structure, reducibility and Mn<SUP>4+</SUP> fraction of
   ε-MnO2 microcubes for the complete oxidation of toluene
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB 3D architectures porous epsilon-type manganese dioxide (epsilon-MnO2 ) microcubes (PEMD) are successfully prepared by a glucose-urea-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of MnCO3-carbon composites followed by annealing. It turns out that urea essentially assists in building the cubic shape while glucose plays a crucial role to form carbon inside the microcrystals, which are latterly removed by annealing to generate the porous structure. As a result, epsilon-MnO2 materials possessing extraordinary features including the high porosity, reducibility, lattice oxygen reactivity and Mn4+ fraction, are feasible tailored. These unique properties, all together, significantly improve the catalytic performances of complete oxidation of toluene. Thus, it is found that the optimal catalyst (manganeseglucose-urea ratio of 6-2-6) synthesized at 180 degrees C exhibits an excellent activity for the complete oxidation of toluene (T-90 = 243 degrees C, lower 10 degrees C than that of pristine epsilon-MnO2 ) and stability up to 10 h.

TI Ni(II)-Incorporated Porphyrin-Based Conjugated Porous Polymer Derived
   from 2,6-Diformyl-4-methylphenol as a Catalyst for the Urea Oxidation
   Reaction
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an excellent alternative to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as an anode reaction for hydrogen generation via electrochemical water splitting. Here, a porphyrin-based conjugated porous polymer (CPP) has been developed through the polycondensation reaction of 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol and pyrrole (DMP-POR). The nickel(II) complex of this conjugated polymer Ni-DMP-POR shows efficient UOR in an alkaline medium. The as-synthesized materials were characterized by solid-state 13C CP-MAS, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The porous property of the materials was characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K. Both DMP-POR and Ni-DMP-POR showed excellent thermal stability. The Ni-DMP-POR exhibits very good UOR in 1 M KOH and 0.33 M urea with an overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec-1. The catalyst also shows excellent chronoamperometric and chronopotentiometric stability, suggesting its future scope in sustainable hydrogen production from wastewater resources.

TI Black phosphorus-based nanocomposites and transition metal phosphates
   for electrocatalytic oxidation of small molecules
SO MOLECULAR CATALYSIS
AB The electrochemical oxidation reaction of small molecules (EORSM) has attracted extensive attention due to its advantages such as mild operating conditions, high conversion efficiency, good selectivity and environmental friendliness. Moreover, with relatively fast reaction kinetics and low theoretical thermodynamic equilibrium potential, EORSM is expected to replace anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The coupling of EORSM at anode with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at cathode could realize multiple targets including high-value chemicals production, pollutant degradation and efficient hydrogen production. Black phosphorus-based nanocomposites are supposed as a promising EORSM electrocatalyst due to their adjustable electronic structure, large specific surface area, high carrier mobility and active lone pair electrons. Apart from that, transition metal phosphates (TMPs) are also widely used for EORSM because of their abundant active sites, strong electrical conductivity and adjustable component structure. This mini review briefly summarizes the recent progress of EORSM including alcohol oxidation, urea oxidation and hydrazine oxidation over BP-based nanocomposites or TMPs. In addition, possible challenges and research directions are also discussed for inspiring people to optimize EORSM using BP-based nanocomposites and TMPs.

TI Alternate wetting and drying irrigation combined with the proportion of
   polymer-coated urea and conventional urea rates increases grain yield,
   water and nitrogen use efficiencies in rice
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Interaction between water and nitrogen (N) plays important roles in regulating crop yields and resource use efficiencies. Little is known, however, if and how irrigation regimes could synergistically interact with proportions of polymer-coated urea (PCU) and conventional urea (CU) rates to increase grain yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and N use efficiency (NUE) in rice. This study investigated the question. Field experiments were conducted with three N treatments, 100 % CU (N1), 100 % PCU (N2), and 70 % PCU + 30 % CU (N3), and two irrigation regimes, continuously flooded (CF) and alternate wetting and moderate drying irrigation (AWMD). The results showed that grain yield, internal N use efficiency, N partial factor productivity, and WUE exhibited small differences among the three N treatments in the CF regime, whereas they were the highest under N3, and the lowest under N1 in the AWMD regime. The above parameters were the highest under the N3 + AWMD among the all treatment combinations. Enhanced root and shoot growth, especially increases in root oxidation activity, leaf area duration, crop growth rate, and photosynthetic NUE, and increased N uptake, pre-stored carbon remobilization from stems during grain filling, and harvest index at maturity, and higher nitrate-N content in the soil accounted for a better synergistic interaction under the N3 + AWMD treatment. Collectively, adoption of an AWMD regime with an appropriate proportion of PCU and CU rates (70 % PCU + 30 % CU) can synergistically increase grain yield and resource use efficiency by improving biological process in rice.

   nanoflower/nanourchin arrays grown on HCNs: a highly efficient
   bi-functional electrocatalyst for boosting hydrogen
   productionviathe urea electro-oxidation reaction
SO NANOSCALE
AB Over the last few years, substantial efforts have been made to develop earth-abundant bi-functional catalysts for urea oxidation and energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production due to their low cost and the potential to replace traditional noble-metal-based catalysts. Nevertheless, finding a straightforward and effective route to prepare efficient catalysts with unique structural features and optimal supports still is a big challenge. Among the various candidates, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived materials show great advantages as new kinds of active non-precious catalysts. On the other hand, the controllable integration of MOFs and carbon-based nanomaterials leads to further enhancement in terms of the stability and electrical conductivity of catalysts. In this communication, we develop an MOF-carbon-based composite to synthesize a transition metal phosphide (TMP) catalyst for the electrocatalytic oxidation of urea. First, poly(pyrrole-co-aniline) (PPCA) hollow nanospheres were fabricatedviathein situemulsion polymerization of a mixture of aniline and pyrrole in the presence of Triton X-100. Then, the simple carbonization treatment of these PPCA hollow spheres led to the carbonized hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) with ultrahigh surface areas and uniform nano-morphologies. After that, bimetallic MM '/MOFs (M/M ' = Ni, Co) were uniformly grown around the HCNsviaa simple hydrothermal reaction (NiCo/MOF@HCNs). During the synthesis process, by adjusting Ni/Co ratios, the MOF morphology can be engineered so that by reducing the Ni/Co ratio, the flower-like structures change into urchin-like structures. Finally, this NiCo/MOF@HCNs precursor with different Ni/Co ratios during thein situcarbonization/phosphorization was chemically converted into Ni-Co mixed-metal phosphides (NixCo2-xP/C@HCNs). Finally, the electrocatalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was tested for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

TI Selective Control of Oxidation Resistance of Diamond by Dopings
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB A method based on the density functional theory calculations is proposed for predicting the influences of dopants on the diamond oxidation, by evaluating the O adsorption energy, chemical bond weakening related to desorption, and probable products. It is proven by verification tests that oxidation resistances of the diamond materials can be indeed selectively controlled (e.g., -36 to 54.3% for diamond films, -36.5 to 45.1% for diamond grits) by adding various doping sources ((CH3O)(3)B, Si(OC2H5)(4), N-2, and CO(NH2)(2)), attributed to their direct impurity incorporation, or modified gas chemistry. B and Si dopings can improve the oxidation resistance, but the addition of N-2 or urea plays an opposite role. Reactive ion etching and chemomechanical polishing tests are also accomplished, further demonstrating the influences of dopings on oxidation-related processes. This study paves the way for enhancing the efficiencies of the ultraprecision machining and micro-nano machining on the diamonds. Most importantly, the proposed prediction method can be potentially used in similar cases with other dopants and in other materials.

TI Removal of urea from swimming pool water by UV/VUV: The roles of
   additives, mechanisms, influencing factors, and reaction products
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB To discover an applicable technology for urea abatement from swimming pool water (SPW), this study compared the performances of seven ultraviolet (UV)-based technologies on urea removal, including UV alone, UV coupled with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2), sulfite (UV/Na2SO3), potassium persulfate (UV/K2S2O8), a combination of UV and vacuum UV (UV/VUV), and UV/VUV in tandem with either H2O2 (VUV/H2O2) or potassium persulfate (VUV/K2S2O8). Among them, UV and UV/Na2SO3 showed little removal ability, and UV/H2O2 removed only 12.8% of urea within 3-h experiments, while UV/VUV degraded 71.7% of urea without introducing substantial total dissolved solids (TDS). Therefore, UV/VUV was considered as a promising technology for further exploration. In comparison, although UV/K2S2O8 exhibited higher urea removal than UV/VUV, it caused dramatic increases of TDS, which made the regulatory threshold for the TDS increment difficult to maintain. Within UV/VUV studies, some common components in SPW (e.g., cyanuric acid, humic acid, nitrate, and bicarbonate) inhibited the removal process, whereas chloride and sulfate facilitated it, while free chlorine at doses <= 3 mg-Cl-2/L and pH levels from 6.8 to 8.0 imposed little impact on urea degradation. Overall, UV/VUV degraded 40.0% and 22.2% of urea from tap water and SPW, respectively; both were lower than the efficiency observed in ultrapure water. As for reaction byproducts, urea phototransformation via UV/VUV yielded nitrate and ammonia as the key products with the mass balance of nitrogen element being met. However, the contents of organic carbon decreased at a rate slightly lower than urea degradation, suggesting that urea was mostly mineralized and slightly converted to unknown organic compounds. The results hence demonstrate that UV/VUV is an effective alternative for urea removal from SPW. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI ZnO modified by urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct as photocatalyst for
   2-propanol photooxidation in the gas phase under different irradiations
SO REACTION KINETICS MECHANISMS AND CATALYSIS
AB Zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized via sol-gel process using zinc acetate dihydrate, ethanol and oxalic acid as precursor, solvent and complexing agent, respectively. Urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP) and urea were added as modification agents. UHP played, simultaneously, the role of nitrogen precursor and oxygen donor. Structural, morphological, textural and optical properties of zinc oxide samples were studied using XRD, SEM, BET, UV-Vis-DRS and Raman techniques. The XRD patterns and Raman spectroscopy results showed that the products consisted of ZnO and revealed that nitrogen was doped in the lattice of ZnO. SEM images revealed the occurrence of agglomeration and aggregation of ZnO nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO samples was estimated based on the photooxidation of 2-propanol in gaseous phase under UV and solar irradiations. Under both UV and solar irradiations, ZnO doped with UHP showed higher photocatalytic activity in comparison with bare ZnO and ZnO doped with only urea. The results showed that increasing the crystallite size has a direct effect on the improvement of the photocatalytic activity of ZnO.

TI Identification of enzymes involved in oxidation of phenylbutyrate
SO JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH
AB In recent years the short-chain fatty acid, 4-phenylbutyrate (PB), has emerged as a promising drug for various clinical conditions. In fact, PB has been Food and Drug Administration-approved for urea cycle disorders since 1996. PB is more potent and less toxic than its metabolite, phenylacetate (PA), and is not just a pro-drug for PA, as was initially assumed. The metabolic pathway of PB, however, has remained unclear. Therefore, we set out to identify the enzymes involved in the beta-oxidation of PB. We used cells deficient in specific steps of fatty acid beta-oxidation and ultra-HPLC to measure which enzymes were able to convert PB or its downstream products. We show that the first step in PB oxidation is catalyzed solely by the enzyme, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The second (hydration) step can be catalyzed by all three mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase enzymes, i.e., short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, and 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase. Enzymes involved in the third step include both short-and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The oxidation of PB is completed by only one enzyme, i.e., long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.(jlr) Taken together, the enzymatic characteristics of the PB degradative pathway may lead to better dose finding and limiting the toxicity of this drug.

TI Urea removal in reclaimed water used for ultrapure water production by
   spent coffee biochar/granular activated carbon activating
   peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB This study evaluated the performance of spent coffee biochar (SCBC)/granular activated carbon (GAC) activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS) for urea degradation in reclaimed water used for ultrapure water production. Results showed that catalyst and oxidant wielded a great influence on urea removal. Of them, the GAC-PMS system could completely remove urea at the least oxidant (1 g/L) and catalyst dosage (0.2 g/L). GAC activating PMS mainly depended on graphite C structure and minor oxygen functional groups. However, the amounts of urea removed by 600BC-PMS and 900BC-PMS were 57% and 70%, respectively. In the PDS system, the urea removal through GAC-PDS could reach 90%, which mainly depends on the graphite C structure of GAC. Using the same conditions, the urea removal of 900BC-PDS was similar to GAC-PDS, so it has some potential as an alternative to commercial GAC.

   structure and catalytic activity in sulfide oxidation
SO POLYHEDRON
AB A novel binuclear iron(III)-salicylaldazine complex has been synthesized and characterized by various techniques such as IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The catalytic oxidation of sulfides in the presence of the aforementioned complex was explored at room temperature using urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) as an oxidant. Effects of different reaction conditions consisting catalyst and oxidant amount, solvent effect and reaction time on the catalytic activity and selectivity in the reaction of methylphenylsulfide oxidation has been surveyed. Perfect selectivity toward sulfoxide was achieved after 15 min in CH3CN by choice of a properly optimized reaction condition. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Direct growth of Au nanoparticles on g-C3N4 for
   photocatalytic selective alcohol oxidations
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Direct growth of Au nanoparticles on g-C3N4 has been successfully achieved by a facile in-situ redox reaction between oxidative Au precursor and reductive gases produced via urea decomposition for the first time, which exhibits the highly enhanced activity for selective alcohol oxidations in aqueous medium under visible-light irradiation due to the synergetic effects of the increased surface area, the enhanced light-harvesting ability and the improved separation efficiency of photocharges. Meanwhile, this photocatalyst also demonstrates strong stability, showing good potential in practical applications. This work can deliver some new insights to develop highly active photocatalysts for organic transformation reactions.

TI A novel combined system using
   Na2S2O8/urea to simultaneously remove
   SO2 and NO in marine diesel engine exhaust
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB The novel combined system using Na2S2O8/urea was used to simultaneously absorb nitric oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from marine diesel engines as well as inhibit the formation of nitrate in cleaning wastewater to meet the increasingly stringent requirements of regulations. The influences of reaction temperature, Na2S2O8 concentration, urea concentration, SO2 concentration, NO concentration and pH value on SO2 removal efficiency, NO removal efficiency and nitrate concentration were investigated. The experimental results showed that different reaction temperatures had different influences on SO2 removal efficiency, NO removal efficiency and nitrate concentration. An increase in Na2S2O8 could improve the absorption of NO. The addition of urea could effectively improve the removal efficiency of NO and reduce the nitrate concentration. The removal efficiencies of 1000 ppm NO and 1000 ppm SO2 achieved 100 % with 0.2 mol/L Na2S2O8 and 2 mol/L urea at 70 degrees C, and the nitrate content was 8.56 mg/L which was far lower than the regulatory requirement of 60 mg/L. The acidic condition (pH <= 5.5) not only facilitated the absorption of NO but also reduced the generation of nitrate. According to the experimental results, the novel combined system was promising to be applied to the control technology of marine diesel engine exhaust

TI Synthesis of nickel-sphere coated Ni-Mn layer for efficient
   electrochemical detection of urea
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Using a trustworthy electrochemical sensor in the detection of urea in real blood samples received a great attention these days. A thin layer of nickel-coated nickel-manganese (Ni@NiMn) is electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode (GC) (Ni@NiMn/GC) surface and used to construct the electrochemical sensor for urea detection. Whereas, electrodeposition is considered as strong technique for the controllable synthesis of nanoparticles. Thus, X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscope (AFM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques were used to characterize the produced electrode. AFM and SEM pictures revealed additional details about the surface morphology, which revealed a homogenous and smooth coating. Furthermore, electrochemical research was carried out in alkaline medium utilizing various electrochemical methods, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical investigations showed that the electrode had good performance, high stability and effective charge transfer capabilities. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical characteristics of Ni@NiMn/GC electrodes were well understood using the analytical and electrochemical techniques. The electrode showed a limit of detection (LOD) equal to 0.0187 mu M and a linear range of detection of 1.0-10 mM of urea. Furthermore, real blood samples were used to examine the efficiency of the prepared sensor. Otherwise, the anti-interfering ability of the modified catalyst was examined toward various interfering species.

TI In situ Grown Ni phosphate@Ni12P5 Nanorod Arrays
   as a Unique Core-Shell Architecture: Competitive Bifunctional
   Electrocatalysts for Urea Electrolysis at Large Current Densities
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB It is still a big challenge to develop active, stable, and easy-to-make bifunctional non-noble electrocatalysts for upshifting overall urea-assisted water splitting toward practical environmental applications at large current densities with lower cell voltages. In response, here we report a competitive bifunctional electrocatalyst that can catalyze both the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by fabricating the in situ grown Ni phosphate (shell)-anchored Ni12P5 nanorod (core) arrays on the 3D Ni foam skeleton (named as Ni12P5 /NiPi/NF). Benefiting from the unique hierarchical core-shell nanorod architecture with abundant exposed active sites and improved electron and mass transfer efficiency, such elaborate binder-free arrays could act as a robust 3D UOR anode and can achieve 900 mA cm(-2) only at potentials of 1.378 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. Additionally, this electrode also shows remarkable cathodic HER catalytic activities. Moreover, when constructing an alkaline electrolyzer using the bifunctional electrodes, the integrated system is capable of delivering the current density of 500 mA cm(-2) stably for over 6 h at a cell voltage as low as 1.662 V, which is 287 mV less than that for pure water splitting. As such, our result may become a significant step in developing an industrial electrolyzer for meaningful massive electrocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) production by urea-assisted water splitting.

TI Modulating the electronic structure of Ni(OH)2 by coupling
   with low-content Pt for boosting the urea oxidation reaction enables
   significantly promoted energy-saving hydrogen production
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Replacing the high-potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by the low-potential nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is an essential way to further promote the production rate of hydrogen during water electrolysis. Here, low-content Pt-anchored Ni(OH)(2) on the surface of nickel-carbon nanofibers (Ni-CNFs) are prepared via a simple electrospinning-electrodeposition strategy to achieve the alkaline urea oxidation reaction (UOR) electrocatalysis, and they are optimized by controlling different concentrations of deposition solutions during the electrodeposition process. Owing to the Pt loading on the Ni(OH)(2) surface, the dehydrogenation processes of both Ni(OH)(2) to Ni(OH)O and urea molecules to N-2 and CO2 are promoted, leading to a greatly enhanced UOR performance with low potentials of 1.363 and 1.422 V vs. RHE at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) for the optimized Pt-Ni(OH)(2)@Ni-CNFs-2 catalyst, which is significantly better than many reported representative Ni-based catalysts. Moreover, considering the superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the optimized Pt@Ni-CNFs-2 catalyst through a similar synthetic procedure, a home-made urea-assisted water splitting device is constructed with the Pt-Ni(OH)(2)@Ni-CNFs-2 and Pt@Ni-CNFs-2 catalysts serving as the anode and cathode, respectively, which exhibits a voltage of 1.40 V at 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing many reported representative urea-assisted water splitting electrolyzers. The as-fabricated electrolyzer displays a significantly promoted H-2 production rate of 10-fold that of the overall water splitting, demonstrating the prominent prospects of our catalysts in urea-assisted water splitting for energy-saving H-2 generation.

TI Urea fertilization increased CO2 and CH4 emissions
   by enhancing C-cycling genes in semi-arid grasslands
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Global climate change is predicted to increase exogenous N input into terrestrial ecosystems, leading to significant changes in soil C-cycling. However, it remains largely unknown how these changes affect soil C-cycling, especially in semi-arid grasslands, which are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems. Here, based on a 3-year field study involving N additions (0, 25, 50, and 100 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of urea) in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau, we investigated the impact of urea fertilization on plant characteristics, soil properties, CO2 and CH4 emissions, and microbial C cycling genes. The compositions of genes involved in C cycling, including C fixation, degradation, methanogenesis, and methane oxidation, were determined using metagenomics analysis. We found that N enrichment increased both above- and belowground biomasses and soil organic C content, but this positive effect was weakened when excessive N was input (N100). N enrichment also altered the C-cycling processes by modifying C-cycle-related genes, specifically stimulating the Calvin cycle C-fixation process, which led to an increase in the relative abundance of cbbS, prkB, and cbbL genes. However, it had no significant effect on the Reductive citrate cycle and 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle. N enrichment led to higher soil CO2 and CH4 emissions compared to treatments without added N. This increase showed significant correlations with C degradation genes (bglA, per, and lpo), methanogenesis genes (mch, ftr, and mcr), methane oxidation genes (pmoA, pmoB, and pmoC), and the abundance of microbial taxa harboring these genes. Microbial C-cycling genes were primarily influenced by N-induced changes in soil properties. Specifically, reduced soil pH largely explained the alterations in methane metabolism, while elevated available N levels were mainly responsible for the shift in C fixation and C degradation genes. Our results suggest that soil N enrichment enhances microbial C-cycling processes and soil CO2 and CH4 emissions in semi-arid ecosystems, which contributes to more accurate predictions of ecosystem C-cycling under future climate change.

TI Selective degradation of endogenous organic metabolites in acidified
   fresh human urine using sulphate radical-based advanced oxidation
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The human urine metabolome is complex, containing a wide range of organic metabolites that affect treatment of urine collected in resource-oriented sanitation systems. In this study, an advanced oxidation process involving heat-activated peroxydisulphate was used to selectively oxidise organic metabolites in urine over urea and chloride. Initial experiments evaluated optimal conditions (peroxydisulphate dose, temperature, time, pH) for activation of peroxydisulphate in unconcentrated, non-hydrolysed synthetic urine and real urine acidified to pH 3.0. Subsequent experiments determined the fate of 268 endogenous organic metabolites (OMs) and removal of COD from unconcentrated and concentrated real urine (80-90% mass reduced by evaporation). The results revealed >90% activation of 60 mM peroxydisulphate in real unconcentrated urine heated to 90 degrees C for 1 h, resulting in 43% Sigma OMs degradation, 22% COD removal and 56% total organic carbon removal, while >94% of total nitrogen and >97% of urea in real unconcentrated urine were recovered. The mechanism of urea degradation was identified to be chemical hydrolysis to ammonia, with the rate constant for this reaction determined to be 1.9 x 10(-6) s(-1) at pH 3.0 and 90 degrees C. Treating concentrated real urine resulted in similar removal of COD, Sigma OMs degradation and total nitrogen loss as observed for unconcentrated urine, but with significantly higher chloride oxidation and chemical hydrolysis of urea. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that peroxydisulphate treatment degraded 157 organic metabolites in urine, of which 67 metabolites were degraded by >80%. The rate constant for the reaction of sulphate radicals with oxidisable endogenous organic metabolites in urine was estimated to exceed 10(8) M-1 s(-1). These metabolites were preferentially oxidised over chloride and urea in acidified, non-hydrolysed urine treated with peroxydisulphate. Overall, the findings support the development of emerging urine recycling technologies, including alkaline/acid dehydration and reverse osmosis, where the presence of endogenous organic urine metabolites significantly influences treatment parameters such as energy demand and product purity.

TI Catalytic oxidation of nitrogen containing compounds for nitrogen
   determination
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB The high temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO) performance of Al2O3 supported Pt, Cu, Cu-Ce and Fe catalysts were systematically studied with a perspective of selective oxidation of nitrogenous compounds to nitric oxide for quantitative determination of bound nitrogen. The catalyst samples were prepared via impregnation and characterized by XRD and BET. In addition, temperature programmed reaction experiments with acetonitrile and oxygen were conducted to evaluate the catalytic activity and selectivity toward N-2, N2O and NO. The catalyst samples were also tested for model components; urea, EDTA, pyridine, glutamic acid and ammonium sulfate representing different functional groups.
   The conversion of acetonitrile was tended to increase in the order of Cu-Ce/Al2O3> Cu/Al2O3> Pt/Al2O3> Fe/Al2O3 at around 500 degrees C and almost complete conversion of acetonitrile was achieved at 700 degrees C over the all catalyst samples studied. Temperature programmed reaction experiments indicated that two reaction routes, direct oxidation of cyanide species and oxidation of ammonia formed by hydrolysis of cyanide species determine NO selectivity. Direct oxidation of cyanide species is favored over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst which exhibit highest NO yield (93%) at 700 degrees C. The second route, hydrolysis of cyanide species to ammonia which is further oxidized to N-2, NO and NO2 was evidenced by TPR-FTIR analyses over Fe/Al2O3, Cu/Al2O3 and Cu-Ce/Al2O3 catalysts. Among these catalysts, highest NO yield (90%) was observed over Fe/Al2O3 at 700 degrees C which is comparable to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. For Cu and Cu-Ce/Al2O3 catalyst, lower yields were obtained due to higher N-2 selectivity. Similar results were obtained from benchmark tests performed by model nitrogen components representing different functional groups. Pt/Al2O3 and Fe/Al2O3 catalysts possessed higher oxidation activities and nitrogen recoveries than Cu and Cu-Ce catalysts. As a result, Fe/Al2O3 catalyst is highly effective, lower cost alternative to existing Pt based catalysts which are used for bound nitrogen determination.

TI Nitrogen Doped Graphene Supported Pt Nanoflowers as Electrocatalysts for

SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A facile Pt nanoflowers/nitrogen-doped graphene (PtNFs/NG) electrocatalyst was prepared via depositing Pt nanoflowers (PtNFs) onto the nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) matrix with urea as the nitrogen source and PtNFs/NG modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was prepared by electrochemical method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to characterize the resulting composites. Also oxidation of formaldehyde on the resulting PtNFs/NG modified electrode was investigated. The influence of deposition time, electrodeposition potential and formaldehyde concentration on electrooxidation of formaldehyde was detected, the experimental results indicate the high performance of PtNFs/NG catalyst for formaldehyde oxidation is at electrodeposition time of 300 s with the applied potential of -0.3 V. Electrochemical process, electrocatalytic stability and chronoamperometry were also inspected, it was indicated that formaldehyde oxidation reaction on the PtNFs/NG electrode is diffusion-controlled and PtNFs/NG exhibits a high catalytic activity, stability as well as excellent poisoning-tolerance towards formaldehyde oxidation, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of PtNFs and NG. It turns out that PtNFs/NG can be used in direct liquid-feed fuel cells as a promising alternative catalyst.

TI Electrochemical Oxidation of Sulfur Dioxide on Nitrogen-Doped Graphite

SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB This work reports on the electrochemical oxidation of sulfur dioxide on nitrogen-doped graphite (NG) in acidic media. The NG samples were prepared via one-step pyrolysis of the mixtures of sugar and urea at 700-1000 degrees C in argon atmosphere. Mechanism analysis indicated that the electrochemical oxidation reaction of sulfur dioxide on NG was irreversible and diffusion controlled. Moreover, the influence of pyrolysis temperature on the electrocatalytic activity of NG was also investigated. The electrochemical measurement and physical characterization results revealed that elevating the pyrolysis temperature could enhance the electrocatalytic activity of NG, which might ascribe to the improved surface area, graphitization degree and electrical conductivity.

TI Understanding the Role of Tantalum in Heteropoly Tungstate Catalysts for
   the Synthesis of Glycerol Carbonate from Glycerol and Urea
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB Tantalum exchanged tungstophosphoric acid (Ta(x)TPA) catalysts were prepared and studied for the synthesis of glycerol carbonate from glycerol and urea. These catalysts were characterized by FT-IR, X-ray diffraction, Laser Raman, pyridine adsorbed FT-IR and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia. The characterization results indicate that the Keggin ion structure of tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) is intact. The activity towards the synthesis of GC over the Ta(x)TPA catalysts depended on the number of Ta5+ ions exchanged in the secondary structure of heteropoly tungstate. Presence of Ta in TPA leads to the generation of Lewis acidic sites. Catalysts with partially exchanged Ta with the protons of TPA showed high activity due to the presence of both Bronsted and Lewis acidic sites. Different reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, glycerol to urea molar ratio and catalyst loading were studied and optimum conditions were established. These catalysts exhibited reusability.

TI Degradation mechanism and QSAR models of antibiotic contaminants in soil
   by MgFe-LDH engineered biochar activating urea-hydrogen peroxide
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Developing an in-situ soil remediation technology for simultaneous catalytic degradation of contaminants and nitrogen supplementation is of great importance but remains challenging. Herein, MgFe-LDH engineered biochar (MB) was successfully synthesized by using a simple co-precipitation method. The as-prepared materials were used as catalysts for the first time to activate urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP) to degrade antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and provide nitrogen. The enhanced degradation efficiency of SMX (91%) were mainly attributed to center dot OH and 1O2-mediated oxidation. Pot experiments showed MB/UHP significantly decreased the SMX concentration from 6.47 to 2.10 mg kg-1 and simultaneously increased NH4+-N and NO3--N concentration. The optimal quantitative-structure-activity-relationship model for 19 antibiotics suggested the dipole moment, energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital, and bond order were the intrinsic influencing factors. This study not only provides a green remediation technology but also offers a theoretical basis for estimating the removal rate of unexplored antibiotics.

TI The synthesis of W-Ni3S2/NiS nanosheets with
   heterostructure as a high-efficiency catalyst for urea oxidation
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The development of efficient and stable non-precious-metal-based electrocatalysts is essential for practical water splitting applications. The electrolysis of water for hydrogen production is a green and efficient method, while urea electrolysis can improve energy conversion efficiency. In this paper, W-Ni3S2/NiS catalysts with heterogeneous structures were synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method using a W-doping-induced phase transition strategy. The doping of W modulates the morphology of the catalyst, which can form uniform nanorod arrays and improve the activity of the electrocatalyst. In an alkaline solution of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, W-Ni3S2/NiS requires a potential of only 1.309 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). An electrolyzer containing urea with W-Ni3S2/NiS as both the cathode and anode can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a potential of only 1.569 V and has relatively good stability after testing for 20 h. Experimental results show that the improvement in the catalytic activity is due to the rapid charge transfer, exposure of more active sites and better conductivity. Density functional theory calculations show that the W-Ni3S2 material exhibits higher urea adsorption energy, indicating that urea is preferentially adsorbed on its surface. The NiS material shows more state density near the Fermi level, indicating that the introduction of this material enhances the conductivity of the W-Ni3S2/NiS material. The synergistic catalysis of the two materials promoted the improvement of the catalytic activity. This work provides new ideas for the development of highly efficient and stable catalysts by means of doping and interface construction.

TI Defect-promoted nanoparticles-nanorod Ni-NiMoO4 heterogeneous
   nanostructures as efficient electrocatalysts to overall water/urea
   splitting in fresh/sea water
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The heterogeneous nanoparticles-nanorod Ni- NiMoO4 nanostructures grown in situ on nickel foam (Ni- NiMoO4/NF) were rationally engineered as efficient electrocatalysts. The morphological and compositional features cooperatively propel high-performance electrocatalysis to hydrogen evolution reaction (eta 10, eta 100, and eta 200 values are 26/84/113 mV in fresh water and 27/101/132 mV in seawater), urea oxidation reaction (eta 10, eta 100, and eta 200 values are 1.321/1.340/1.356 and 1.329/1.344/1.361 V in fresh/seawater). The Ni- NiMoO4/NF nanostructures therefore perform a low cell voltage of 1.506/1.509@10 mA cm-2 in fresh/sea water. Specifically, the record cell voltage even drops to as low as 1.339/1.361 V in fresh/sea water for overall urea splitting (OUS) reaction with a long-term stability for 240 h@100 mA cm-2 toward OUS in seawater. More importantly, to realize a green manner, we also evaluated a solar-driven H2 production. Even in seawater, H2 gas was collected in high speed under solar illumination on a commercial solar panel.

TI Nitrogen-doped graphene-based materials for advanced oxidation processes
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
CT CarboCat 6 Symposium
CY JUN 22-25, 2014
CL Trondheim, NORWAY
AB Nitrogen-doped graphene-based materials were prepared by the modified Hummers method using natural graphite as primary precursor, followed by chemical and thermal reduction processes, and finally ball milled with urea or melamine. The graphene-based materials were characterized at different stages of their synthesis by different techniques (including temperature programmed desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and then tested as metal-free catalysts in the degradation of oxalic acid and phenol by two different oxidation processes: catalytic wet air oxidation (temperature between 413 and 433 K, and 7 bar of O-2) and catalytic ozonation (room temperature and atmospheric pressure). The melamine treated sample was always found to be more active due to the presence of nitrogen groups and adequate surface area available. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An efficient Urea-formaldehyde resin degradation method by hydrogen
   peroxide and malic acid: At three-mole ratios
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin has a high annual output, but the used and waste UF resin poses a challenge for recycling due to the difficulty in effectively decomposition them. In this study, A novel one-step degradation method was proposed, i.e., using eco-friendly malic acid and hydrogen peroxide to degrade cured UF resin residues using carboxylic acid through the hydrothermal oxidation method (HPMA), which was proved to have high cured UF resin degradation efficiency. This method will offer a new path for effectively recycling the UF resin out of service.

TI Multiwalled carbon nanotubes twined α-nickel hydroxide microspheres as
   high-efficient urea electrooxidation catalysts
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) twined alpha-Ni(OH)(2) microspheres, denoted as alpha-Ni(OH)(2)@-MWCNT, are synthesized by a facile solvothermal method and are developed as a remarkably active catalyst for urea electrooxidation in alkaline media. Through optimizing the mass ratio between alpha-Ni(OH)(2) and MWCNT, it is found that alpha-Ni(OH)(2)@MWCNT catalyst with a weight ratio of 2.5:1 affords the highest current density of 2503 mA cm(-2) mg(-1) at the potential of 0.58 V versus Hg/HgO and the largest exchange current density of 1.49 x 10(-4) mA cm(-2) among all the studied catalysts, which are much higher than that of pure alpha-Ni(OH)(2) microspheres and are about one order of magnitude higher than that of reported Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. Additionally, the alpha-Ni(OH)(2)@-MWCNT catalysts also present superior durability than pure alpha-Ni(OH)(2). The exceptional catalytic performance of alpha-Ni(OH)(2)@MWCNT catalysts is attributed to the good electronic transport of MWCNT and favorable mass transport facilitated by alpha-Ni(OH)(2) hollow porous microspheres. These results suggest the feasibility of an easy and low-cost solvothermal method to develop high-efficient catalyst for urea electrooxidation.

TI In situ growth of ZIF67 at the edge of nanosheet transformed into
   yolk-shell CoSe2 for high efficiency urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derivatives are excellent electrocatalytic materials due to their own structural characteristics. However, it is still very essential to design a logical synthesis route of MOFs derivatives to avoid the adverse effects caused by the collapse of MOFs structure and improve its intrinsic catalytic activity. For these reasons, we designed and synthesized cobalt-based metal-organic framework (ZIF67) grown in situ at the edge of Co(OH)(2) nanosheets. Through adjusting the alcohol-water ratio of the reaction solution, the number of ZIF67 grown on the Co(OH)(2) can be controlled to make it grow uniformly at the edge of nanosheet. After the selenization reaction in a tube furnace, ZIF67 is transformed into CoSe2 (Co-Z/Se-2) with a yolk-shell structure. This precisely designed synthetic route allows Co-Z/Se-2 to expose more active sites, which is conducive to electron transport and has good performance in both urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Co-Z/Se-2 as UOR catalyst only needs 1.390 V to reach 50 mA cm(-2). Co-Z/Se-2 as bifunctional catalysts, are assembled to be a urea electrolyzer cell. Co-Z/Se-2 parallel to Co-Z/Se-2 only needs 1.490 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2), and can maintain a good stability for 20 h.

TI Synthesis of new hybrid pyridines catalyzed by
   Fe3O4@SiO2@urea-riched ligand/Ch-Cl
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Herein, a new heterogeneous catalytic system through modification of urea functionalized magnetic nanoparticles with choline chloride [Fe3O4@SiO2@urea-riched ligand/Ch-Cl] was designed and synthesized. Then, the synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2@urea-riched ligand/Ch-Cl was characterized by using FT-IR spectroscopy, FESEM, TEM, EDS-Mapping, TGA/DTG and VSM techniques. After that, the catalytic usage of Fe3O4@SiO2@urea-riched ligand/Ch-Cl was investigated for the synthesis of hybrid pyridines with sulfonate and/or indole moieties. Delightfully, the outcome was satisfactory and the applied strategy represents several advantages such as short reaction times, convenience of operation and relatively good yields of obtained products. Moreover, the catalytic behavior of several formal homogeneous DESs was investigated for the synthesis of target product. In addition, a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation pathway was suggested as rational mechanism for the synthesis of new hybrid pyridines.

TI Titanium dioxide surface modified with both palladium and fluoride as an
   efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of urea
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB TiO2 surface modified with both Pd nanoparticles and fluorides (F-TiO2/Pd) was prepared and applied as a photocatalyst in the degradation of urea. Various surface analysis techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, were used to verify the coexistence of Pd nanoparticles and fluorides on the surface of TiO2 in F-TiO2/Pd. F-TiO2/Pd showed a higher photocatalytic activity than those of bare TiO2 and single-component-modified TiO2 photocatalysts such as fluorinated TiO2 (F-TiO2) and Pd-loaded TiO2 (Pd/TiO2). The higher urea degradation efficiency of F-TiO2/Pd is ascribed to the enhanced production of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) by the synergistic action of the surface Pd and fluoride. Pd nanoparticles and fluorides facilitate the transfer of valence band holes (h(vb)(+)) and their reaction with water molecules, respectively, synergistically enhancing the production of (OH)-O-center dot. The photocatalytic activity of F-TiO2/Pd for the degradation of urea increased upon increasing the fraction of the fluorinated TiO2 surface, which is higher at higher fluoride concentrations and lower pH. Although Pt/TiO2 showed higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of urea than those of Pd/TiO2 and Au/TiO2, the strong positive effect of fluoride complexation was only exhibited by Pd/TiO2 (a slight positive effect and a negative effect were observed for Au/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2, respectively). As a result, the degradation of urea proceeded more rapidly in a UV-irradiated suspension of F-TiO2/Pd than when any of other photocatalysts (i.e., bare TiO2, Pd/ TiO2, F-TiO2, Au/TiO2, F-TiO2/Au, Pt/TiO2, and F-TiO2/Pt) were used under the same conditions. The first-order degradation rate constants (k) of urea depending on the type of TiO2 were as follows: 0.097 h(-1) for bare TiO2, 0.158 h(-1) for Pd/TiO2, 0.151 h(-1) for F-TiO2, 0.351 h(-1) for F-TiO2/Pd, 0.173 h(-1) for Au/TiO2, 0.223 h(-1) for F-TiO2/Au, 0.240 h for Pt/TiO2, and 0.165 h(-1) for F-TiO2/Pt, respectively. In addition, F-TiO2/Pd proved to be stable in repeated urea degradation cycles.

TI Metal-organic framework-derived Ni@C and NiO@C as anode catalysts for
   urea fuel cells
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Highly porous self-assembled nanostructured Ni@C and NiO@C were synthesized via calcination of a Ni-based metal-organic framework. The morphology, structure, and composition of as synthesized Ni@C and NiO@C were characterized by SEM, FIB-SEM, TEM, and XRD. The electro-catalytic activity of the Ni@C and NiO@C catalysts towards urea oxidation was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the Ni@C had a higher residual carbon content and a higher specific surface area than NiO@C, thus exhibiting an enhanced electrochemical performance for urea oxidation. A direct urea fuel cell with Ni@C as an anode catalyst featured an excellent maximum power density of 13.8 mW cm(-2) with 0.33 M urea solution in 1 M KOH as fuel and humidified air as oxidant at 50 degrees C, additionally showing excellent stability during continuous 20-h operation. Thus, this work showed that the highly porous carbon-supported Ni catalysts derived from Ni-based metal-organic framework can be used for urea oxidation and as an efficient anode material for urea fuel cells.

TI Synergetic effect of bimetallic Au-Ru/TiO2 catalysts for
   complete oxidation of methanol
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Bimetallic Ru-Au/TiO2 catalysts prepared by deposition-precipitation with urea method were tested for the first time in the total oxidation of methanol. Different Ru:Au atomic ratios were used (1:1-0.25:1). The catalytic activity results showed a synergetic effect at low temperature (RT-50 C-O), mainly for the 1:1 and 0.75:1 atomic ratio. HAADF-STEM and STEM-EDS characterization confirmed the interaction between Ru and Au. TPR, UV-vis spectra, XPS and DRIFTS-CO results also confirm this interaction. FTIR spectra, recorded following the oxidation of methanol as a function of the reaction temperature, showed that formates are the main reaction intermediates in the oxidation of methanol, which are formed from RT on bimetallic Ru-Au catalysts and are oxidized at lower temperatures compared to their monometallic Ru and Au counterparts.

TI Baby diaper's super absorbent polymer derived carbon templated
   NiCuP@NiCu nanostructures for green hydrogen production
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Water electrolysis is considered as the most favorable method to generate hydrogen because of its environmentally friendly approach. As an upgradation of this process, the introduction of urea gives improved energy conversion efficiency and can also be used for the treatment of urea-rich wastewater. Inspired by the above, a bifunctional electro-catalyst, namely NiCuP@NiCu supported on graphitic carbon, is prepared for the first time via high-temperature pyrolysis and in-situ phosphidization process. The carbon support endorses better electron transference, and the presence of mixed active metal redox couples (Mx+/My+, M = Ni&Cu) and their M-O/O-C bonds formation with urea molecule collectively leads to substantial UOR activity. Under alkaline conditions with 0.33 M urea in 1.0 M KOH, the NiCuP@NiCu/C drives 10 mA cm-2 current density with a minimum po-tential of 1.242 V and overpotential of 98 mV for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. What is significant is that NiCuP@NiCu/C is explored as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to construct two electrode electrolyzer, which only requires the minimum potential of 1.313 V to drive 10 mA cm-2 current density. Furthermore, the NiCuP@NiCu/C equipped electrolyzer is used under human urine sample and achieved the maximum H2 production of 0.387 mmol. From the aforementioned outcomes, this works delivers a facile method for exploring an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea electrolysis and providing a new path to real-time fuel approach enabled H2 production.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI Toluene Oxidation by Hydrogen Peroxide in Deep Eutectic Solvents
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB The catalytic effect of several deep eutectic solvents (DESs) on biphasic toluene oxidation by hydrogen peroxide to produce benzaldehyde was studied under various operational conditions. Experiments were performed with sodium tungstate, iron(III) chloride, phosphotungstic acid, and phosphomolybdic acid as catalysts dissolved in three DESs composed of choline chloride and a hydrogen-bond donor molecule such as urea, glycerol, or ethylene glycol. Additionally, a fourth catalytic system composed of iron(III) chloride and choline chloride was tested. The best result was achieved with FeCl3 dissolved in the DES containing ethylene glycol, which gave 37.9% conversion and 63.6% selectivity. The results are better than those reported for other ionic liquids; this may be due to similar activation of hydrogen peroxide by polarization of the peroxide bond through hydrogen bonding and the low viscosity of the solvent.

TI Dual-functional
   Co3O4@Co2P4O12
   nanoneedles supported on nickel foams with enhanced electrochemical
   performance and excellent stability for overall urea splitting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Urea splitting to produce hydrogen is one of the most promising solutions to the energy crisis in the future. A series of Co3O4 and cobalt phosphate composites on nickel foam were synthesized by hydrothermal and calcination process and firstly used as dual-functional electrode for the overall urea splitting. When the current density is 20 mA cm(-2), the required cell voltage is significantly lower than that of fully water splitting. The stability test results show that the composition and morphology of our catalyst do not change significantly before and after the reaction. By controlling the morphology under the same conditions, we concluded that the main factor affecting the activity of urea splitting was specific surface area and synergistic effect.

TI Urea-Assisted Sol-Gel Synthesis of LaMnO3 Perovskite with
   Accelerated Catalytic Activity for Application in Zn-Air Battery
SO BATTERIES-BASEL
AB Precious metal-based materials such as commercial Pt/C are available electrocatalysts for redox reactions in Zn-air batteries. However, their commercial use is still limited by slow kinetics and restricted stability. In this work, we highlight a facial urea-assisted sol-gel method to synthesize A-site vacancy in LaMnO3+delta oxide for boosting its catalytic activity and further explore the effect of the amount of urea on the A-site LaMnO3. The A-site vacancy in LMO was confirmed by XRD, TEM, and XPS, which revealed that the urea-assisted sol-gel method mitigated the A-site vacancy in LaMnO3+delta and increased its surface area, thus ultimately accelerating its redox reaction kinetics. The half-wave potential and current density of the resultant 3.0U-LMO electrocatalyst were 0.74 V and 5.74 mA cm(-2), respectively. It is worth noting that the assembled Zn-air battery with the 3.0U-LMO catalyst presented a power output of 130.04 mW cm(-2) at 0.51 V and a promising energy efficiency of 58.4% after 150 cycles. This protocol might offer an efficient approach for developing new defect-regulated perovskites for electrocatalysis.

TI Effect of products of low temperature oxidation reaction on NOx
   reduction in HC-SCR system
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE
AB Fuel reforming technology using a low temperature oxidation reaction was applied to improvement of NOx reduction efficiency of hydrocarbons selective catalytic reduction (HC-SCR) system, which does not require urea. The low temperature oxidation reaction of hydrocarbons produces oxygenated hydrocarbons which has high NOx reduction ability such as aldehydes. A pre-evaporation and premixing-type fuel reformer was developed in order to generate uniform fuel/air premixed gas. To prevent from hot-flame ignition, the reaction chamber of the fuel reformer has a high surface/volume ratio and the wall temperature of the reaction chamber was controlled. As a fundamental study, NOx reduction experiments and elementary reaction calculation were carried out to investigate the suitable fuel reformer temperature and reforming equivalence ratio for the promotion of NOx reduction on the surface of the catalyst. It was found that the reforming fuel gas has a higher NOx reduction efficiency than the fuel vapor in the catalyst temperature range from 473 to 773 K. The NOx reduction efficiency was highest at the reforming temperature of 673 K. The NOx reduction efficiency at the catalyst temperature of 723 K increases with the increase in the reforming equivalence ratio. It was suggested that alcohols predominantly affect NOx reduction reaction at low catalyst temperatures, and aldehydes at high catalyst temperatures.& COPY; 2022 The Combustion Institute.

TI Construction of heterostructure interface with
   FeNi2S4 and CoFe nanowires as an efficient
   bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and urea
   electrolysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The design of high-performance non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts for electro-oxidation reactions involving splitting of water molecule for energy and environmental applications is the need of the hour. In this study, we report the electrocatalytic performance of a nanocomposite catalyst of FeNi2S4 nanoparticles/CoFe nanowires supported on nickel foam that was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The electrocatalyst has several advantages, such as the nanocomposite structure, relatively high electrical conductivity, and synergistic effect between FeNi2S4 and CoFe. These characteristics enhanced the catalytic efficiency of FeNi2S4/CoFe electrode, gaining small overpotentials of 380 and 207 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively, at a current density of 100 mA cm-2. The charge transfer processes are significantly improved by the electron pairs from FeNi2S4 and CoFe, as well as by the enhanced active sites at the electrode -electrolyte interface and their bonding interactions. The electrooxidation of urea was also explored, which showed a lower overpotential of 230 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2) current density. Interestingly, FeNi2S4/CoFe was successfully employed as cathode and anode for urea-assisted water electrolysis, utilizing 1.56 V to produce 10 mA cm(-2) current density, which is approximately 160 mV below that for water electrolysis, thus verifying the lower energy consumption during electrolysis. These results indicate that nanoparticle and nanowire composite catalysts can be used for wastewater treatment and green energy production applications.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI Thermo-oxidative degradation kinetics of renewable hybrid
   polyurethane-urea obtained from air-oxidized soybean oil
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB This study explores the synthesis and kinetics of non-isothermal thermo-oxidative degradation of renewable hybrid polyurethane (PU)-urea obtained from air-oxidized soybean oil. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetry (TG) analyses were performed, aiming to verify chemical changes and the kinetics parameters using different approaches for the samples obtained. FTIR confirmed that a polymerization process occurred as well and modification in the relative hydrogen bonds is due to the formed urea groups that formed in the hybrid materials. TG analysis showed a dependence of the activation energy (using the FWO and KAS model-free methods) on the degree of conversion for all samples studied in three different degradation steps. The most probable degradation mechanism was tested by using a multivariate nonlinear regression by using the F statistical test. For all samples, the autocatalytic model successfully described the thermo-oxidative degradation, which is in accordance with the chemical degradation process for polyurethanes. Finally, thermal degradation in the time function was estimated and more satisfactory results were obtained by comparing the literature data for similar systems. So, it was possible to obtain reliable and consistent results of the kinetic parameters, which are essential for academic and industrial purposes.

TI Oxidative contaminant degradation on bimetallic boride electrocatalysts
   enhances anodic charge transfer for efficient H2 production
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via electrocatalytic water splitting is restricted by the sluggish ox-ygen evolution reaction (OER). By contrast, alkaline urea electrolysis provides the prospect of energy -saving H2 production together with urea-rich wastewater purification. Here, we report a feasible and reliable strategy for the fabrication of the cuboid-like Co2MoB4 electrode anchored on Co foam. The Co2MoB4 electrocatalyst exhibits high activity toward HER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) as well as superior durability. Specifically, a low HER overpotential of 230 mV is required to support a current density of 100 mA/cm2, and an alkaline urea electrolyzer can achieve 50 mA/cm2 at voltage of 1.632 V, lower than that in alkaline or acetamide electrolytes. In situ electrochemical characterizations reveal that the desired oxidation state of the CoIII formed on the surface is the key features determining a high reactivity for urea oxidation with shortening the oxidation pathway. This scenario is beneficial for accelerating charge transfer across the interface between the anode and electrolyte. Differently, the higher valence Co (IV) is generated to further oxidizing the acetamide, similar to the OER process. Our work demonstrates the promising development of bimetallic borides for urea splitting to produce H2 with reduced energy consumption. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Traditional NiCo2S4 Phase with Porous Nanosheets
   Array Topology on Carbon Cloth: A Flexible, Versatile and Fabulous
   Electrocatalyst for Overall Water and Urea Electrolysis
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB We report on our recent finding here that bimetallic nickel-cobalt sulfide nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (NiCo2S4 NS/CC) by anion exchange from its NiCo-precursor could act as a flexible, versatile and fabulous electrocatalyst for both the overall water splitting and urea electrolysis in base. The overall water-splitting efficiency of this material is higher than that for reported NiCo2S4 nanowire array on CC with just needing a voltage of 1.66 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, this material also shows fabulous catalytic activity and selectivity for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with an ultralow potential of 0.249 V vs SCE to obtain 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing all reported transition-metal based UOR catalysts. An urea-assisted energy-saving alkaline hydrogen-production system was further built here by replacing anodic oxygen evolution reaction with UOR. This whole urea electrolysis cell driven by NiCo2S4 NS/CC (+,-) affords 10 mA cm(-2) at a relative low voltage of 1.49 V, which is 210 mV less than that for urea-free counterpart and also comparable to those for other reported catalysts. The amazing catalytic performances should be due to the intrinsic high activity and metallic feature of NiCo2S4 phase, the nanoporous and open-shelled nanosheet topology that exposes more catalytic active sites and accelerates the diffusion of electrolyte and the generated gas bubbles, as well as the spinel structure and mixed valence states of Ni and Co elements in NiCo2S4 phase that offers richer redox reactions.

AB Employing the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) instead of the water oxidation reaction can not only decrease the theoretic hydrogen generation cell voltage in sustainable energy conversion but also eliminate urea pollution in water. Herein, we used a facile in situ trapping and pre-modification strategy to synthesize MoC@C and hybrid Ni/WC@C nanoparticles and employed the two materials as hydrogen evolution reaction and UOR catalysts, respectively, in an electrolytic cell. The resultant setup can achieve a catalytic current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.5 V in alkaline solutions and maintain stability for at least 12 h in the same conditions.

TI Enhancement of direct urea-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell performance by
   three-dimensional porous nickel-cobalt anode
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB A novel three-dimensional (3D) porous nickel-cobalt (Ni-Co) film on nickel foam is successfully prepared and further used as an efficient anode for direct urea-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (DUHPFC). By varying the cobalt/nickel mole ratios into 0%, 20%, 50%, 80% and 100%, the optimized Ni-Co/Ni foam anode with a ratio of 80% is obtained in terms of the best cell performance among five anodes. Effects of the KOH and urea concentrations, the flow rate and operation temperature on the fuel cell performance are investigated. Results show DUHPFC with the 3D Ni-Co/Ni foam anode exhibits a higher performance than those reported direct urea fuel cells. The cell gives an open circuit voltage of 0.83 V and a peak power density as high as 17.4 and 31.5 mW cm(-2) at 20 degrees C and 70 degrees C, respectively, when operating on 7.0 mol L-1 KOH and 0.5 mol L-1 urea as the fuel at a flow rate of 15 mL min(-1). Besides, when the human urine is directly fed as the fuel, direct urine-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell reaches a maximum power density of 7.5 mW cm(-2) with an open circuit voltage of 0.80 V at 20 degrees C, showing a good application prospect in wastewater treatment.

TI Development of Asymmetric Oxidation Reactions Catalyzed by
   Guanidinium-bisurea Bifunctional Organocatalysts Utilizing Computational
   Methods
SO JOURNAL OF SYNTHETIC ORGANIC CHEMISTRY JAPAN
AB Organocatalysis has become widely used since the early 2000s as a third type of catalysis in addition to the two types of catalysis, metals and enzymes, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 2021 for its pioneering achievements. In organocatalytic reactions, stereoselectivity is often controlled by the cooperative action of weak interactions such as hydrogen bonding and dispersion interactions, and it is extremely difficult to elucidate the stereocontrol mechanism from experimental perspectives. On the other hand, recent advances in computational chemistry have made it possible to deeply understand transition state and clarify important roles in controlling the stereoselectivities in organocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the findings computationally revealed can provide guidelines for the design of new reactions and catalytic structures. Herein, we describe asymmetric oxidation reactions using conformationally flexible bifunctional guanidine-bisurea organocatalysts developed by us and theoretical analysis of the transition states of these reactions. We also discuss the development of novel catalytic reactions and catalyst designs based on the obtained transition state models.

TI Silver nanoparticles modified mesoporous titanosilicate materials for
   high oxidation of carbon monoxide
SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB This paper investigates a new path to synthesis an ordered nanostructured mesoporous titanosilicate by the assembly of preformed titanosilicate (MTS-9) precursors with triblock copolymers. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with different loadings are supported on MTS-9 composite by two different methods: Deposition Precipitation with Urea (DPU) and Impregnation Reduction with Citrate (IRC). The structure and active component of catalysts were confirmed trough N-2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The influence of catalytic activity of AgNPs supported on MTS-9 has been evaluated in the oxidation of Carbon monoxide (CO). The obtained results emphasize on the improvement of catalytic activity of MTS-9 by AgNPs. A total of CO-oxidation up to 100% was achieved at 240 degrees C for the catalyst prepared by impregnation reduction with citrate. Indeed, the 0.5% Ag/MTS-9 (IRC) catalyst exhibited a high stability after four continuous runs. Overall, this catalyst could be very suitable for oxidation of carbon monoxide industrial process.

TI Ni-P nanostructures on flexible paper for morphology effect of
   nonenzymatic electrocatalysis for urea
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB This study accounts the controllable design over the structure and morphology of Ni-P nanomaterials directly growing on cellulose paper, and its excellent non-enzymatic electrocatalytic performance to urea. The Ni-P papers were prepared by simple solution soaking and electroless bathing. And the simple experimental steps and mild experimental conditions make it possible for large-scale industrial production, and potential for practical applications. In addition, tuning the pH and concentration of the electroless bath, the Ni-P nanomaterials with different morphologies of nanoflower, nanosheet, nano-wire microsphere and microsphere were obtained. The Ni-P nanomaterials impart conductivity to cellulose paper while being potently sensitive to urea owing to its high catalytic activity. Cellulose paper has a large specific area and open macroporous framework which hadn't been damaged during the process of electroless bathing, providing much more activated sites for Ni-P deposition. And the prepared Ni-P papers, as composite materials of cellulose papers loading Ni-P nanomaterials, have high electrocatalytic properties to urea. Comparing the electrochemical behaviors of the four Ni-P paper electrodes with different morphologies, the Ni-P nanoflower paper electrode showed the best electrochemical performance with highest sensitivity of 683.46 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) in the low concentration range (0-1 mM) and 1140 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) in the high concentration range (1-11 mM), lowest detection limit of 12 mu M, shortest response time of 3 s, which may owes to the highest surface area of the Ni-P nanoflower structure. It also has a good stability in room environment remaining 97% after 35 days of storage. Moreover, the electrocatalytic activities of the four Ni-P paper electrodes are ranked as follows: nanoflower > nanosheet > nanowire microsphere > microsphere. What's more, the long-term stability and repeatability, good selectivity of the flexible Ni-P paper make it successfully applied to swimming pool water quality monitoring. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Increasing power generation to a single-chamber compost soil urea fuel
   cell for carbon-neutral bioelectricity generation: A novel approach
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Microbial fuel cells (CS-UFC) utilize waste resources containing biodegradable materials that play an essential role in green energy. MFC technology generates "carbon-neutral" bioelectricity and involves a multidisciplinary approach to microbiology. MFCs will play an important role in the harvesting of "green electricity." In this study, a single-chamber urea fuel cell is fabricated that uses these different wastewaters as fuel to generate power. Soil has been used to generate electrical power in microbial fuel cells and exhibited several potential applications to optimize the device; the urea fuel concentration is varied from 0.1 to 0.5 g/mL in a single-chamber compost soil urea fuel cell (CS-UFC). The proposed CS-UFC has a high power density and is suitable for cleaning chemical waste, such as urea, as it generates power by consuming urea-rich waste as fuel. The CS-UFC generates 12 times higher power than conventional fuel cells and exhibits size-dependent behavior. The power generation increases with a shift from the coin cell toward the bulk size. The power density of the CS-UFC is 55.26 mW/m(2). This result confirmed that urea fuel significantly affects the power generation of single-chamber CS-UFC. This study aimed to reveal the effect of soil properties on the generated electric power from soil processes using waste, such as urea, urine, and industrial-rich wastewater as fuel. The proposed system is suitable for cleaning chemical waste; moreover, the proposed CS-UFC is a novel, sustainable, cheap, and eco-friendly design system for soil-based bulk-type design for large-scale urea fuel cell applications.

TI A novel pillar-layered MOF with urea linkers as a capable catalyst for
   synthesis of new 1,8-naphthyridines via the anomeric-based oxidation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Metal-based catalysts play an essential role in organic chemistry and the chemical industry. This research designed and successfully synthesized a pillar-layered metal-organic framework (MOF) with the urea linkers, namely Basu-HDI, as a novel and efficient heterogeneous catalyst. Various techniques such as FT-IR, EDX, elemental mapping, SEM, XRD, BET, and TGA/DTA studied its structure and morphology. Then, we investigated the synthesis of new 1,8-naphthyridines utilizing Basu-HDI in mild conditions via a one-pot, three-component tandem Knoevenagel/Michael/ cyclization/anomeric-based oxidation reaction. Final products were achieved by anomeric-based oxidation without employing an oxidation agent. Remarkably, this tandem process gave a good range of new 1,8-naphthyridines with high yields in a short reaction time. The pure products were confirmed by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry techniques. Moreover, the introduced catalyst showed good efficiency and stability and can be reused four times without significantly reducing efficiency.

TI Effect of Co3O4 Nanoparticles on Improving
   Catalytic Behavior of Pd/Co3O4@MWCNT Composites
   for Cathodes in Direct Urea Fuel Cells
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) have recently drawn increased attention as sustainable power generation devices because of their considerable advantages. Nonetheless, the kinetics of the oxidation-reduction reaction, particularly the electrochemical oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), in direct urea fuel cells are slow and hence considered to be inefficient. To overcome these disadvantages in DUFCs, Pd nanoparticles loaded onto Co3O4 supported by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Pd/Co3O4@MWCNT) were employed as a promising cathode catalyst for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode in DUFCs. Co3O4@MWCNT and Pd/Co3O4@MWCNT were synthesized via a facile two-step hydrothermal process. A Pd/MWCNT catalyst was also prepared and evaluated to study the effect of Co3O4 on the performance of the Pd/Co3O4@MWCNT catalyst. A current density of 13.963 mA cm(-2) and a maximum power density of 2.792 mW cm(-2) at 20 degrees C were obtained. Pd/Co3O4@MWCNT is a prospectively effective cathode catalyst for DUFCs. The dilution of Pd with non-precious metal oxides in adequate amounts is economically conducive to highly practical catalysts with promising electrocatalytic activity in fuel cell applications.

TI Low-cost synthesis of non-noble Ni-based MXene (Ni3C) nanosheets
   decorated nickel foam as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for
   alkaline-acid urea-nitrate fuel cell
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Urea and nitrate are the two indispensable hydrogen generation molecules present in different biological and non-biological sources like human urine, wastewater, groundwater samples. These molecules can be removed via urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and nitrate reduction reaction (NRR) while using them as a source for direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) and direct nitrate fuel cells (DNFCs), respectively. Herein, we report the nickel-based MXene (Ni3C) nanosheets modified 3D skeletal nickel foam (Ni3C/NF) as a bifunctional catalyst electrode for DUFC and DNFC in alkaline and acid electrolytic medium, respectively. The high purity synthesis of Ni3C nanosheets is achieved through a solid-state synthesis of Ni-based MAX compound (Ni3AlC2) followed by an etching and exfoliation process (via solvothermal technique). The as-fabricated Ni3C/NF electrode exhibits a peak current density of 434 mA/cm2 (for UOR) and 85 mA/cm2 (for NRR) at an onset potential of-0.62 V (vs Hg/HgO) and--0.58 V (vs Hg/HgO), respectively. This performance of the electrode is ascribed to the improved electro-catalytic activity of Ni3C nanosheets with good chemical stability and large surface area for UOR and NRR. This excellent bifunctional performance of the catalyst electrode proves the efficacy of the Ni3C nanosheets-based electrode for direct fuel cell applications.

TI Highly active Ni-Fe double hydroxides as anode catalysts for
   electrooxidation of urea
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Urea is a safe and sustainable chemical for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. However, the sluggish kinetic rates of the electrooxidation reaction of urea as well as catalyst stability still remain to be challenges. In this work, we investigated several catalysts for the electro-oxidation of urea by directly growing NiM double hydroxides (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn) on carbon fibre cloth and nickel foam electrodes through a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis method. The results indicated that the activity was significantly related to the elemental composition. Among the investigated double hydroxides, the NiFe double hydroxide (DH) catalyst showed the highest activity, which achieved a specific current density of similar to 95 mA cm(-2) mg(-1) at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, about 10 times larger than that of Ni(OH)(2). In addition, the NiFe DH also had a high activity when grown on a Ni foam substrate. This NiFe DH performs well in the aspect of urea oxidation stability, demonstrating it to be a promising low-cost and stable catalyst for the efficient electrooxidation of urea under alkaline conditions.

TI Coupling platinum with the hierarchical NiCo/oxide heterostructures for
   highly efficient urea-assisted water electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Alloying the platinum with the nickel and cobalt is an efficient approach to lessen the usage of Pt without compromising the catalytic performance. Few studies have focused on coupling the Pt with the NiCo/oxide composite for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesize three types of hierarchical Pt15-NiCo/ oxide composites by impregnation, followed by calcination and hydrogenation treatment. The three electrocatalysts have similar intrinsic activity towards HER in 1.0 M KOH, while the Pt15-NiCo/CeO2- x displays the highest catalytic performance because of its large electrochemically active surface area, showing an extremely small overpotential of 12 mV at 100 mA cm-2, making it the best low-Pt-content electrocatalyst for HER. When used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea-assisted hydrogen production, the Pt15-NiCo/CeO2- x demonstrates excellent catalytic performance with a very small cell voltage of 1.36 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 and robust longterm working stability. The outstanding catalytic performance of the Pt15-NiCo/CeO2- x is assigned to the uniquestructure-induced abundant active sites, the optimized NiCo/CeO2-x, the suitable Pt loading, the synergy between the Pt and the NiCo, and the synergy between the PtNiCo and the CeO2-x.

TI Water activating fresh NiMo foam for enhanced urea electrolysis
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recently, production of hydrogen (H2) through the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has acquired great attention because it is more environmentally friendly and energy-saving. Herein, an approach of water activation was developed for in situ growth of NiMo LDH nanosheet arrays on NiMo foam without using any binder or pressurizing or heating steps. The obtained NiMo foam electrodes showed exceptional catalytic activity and durability for both the UOR and HER. This work offers a new standpoint on designing electrodes with high activation for efficient and sustainable hydrogen production coupled with urea organic oxidation.
   A simple water-activation strategy was adopted to rapidly synthesize an efficient and stable electrode featuring in situ autologous catalyst-substrate characteristics.

TI Advanced Mott-Schottky heterojunction of semi-conductive MoS2
   nanoparticles/metallic CoS2 nanotubes as an efficient
   multifunctional catalyst for urea-water electrolysis
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB Metallic CoS2 has attracted considerable interest for the catalysis of electrochemical reactions; however, its catalytic activity is still lower than that of commercial novel metal-based catalysts. Semiconductive 2H-MoS2 also holds a high capability for catalysis. In this work, a rationally designed Mott-Schottky heterojunction of ultrasmall MoS2 nanoparticles/CoS2 nanotube arrays is constructed via an effective synthetic protocol. Because of the difference in the Fermi level of the metallic CoS2 and semiconducting MoS2, strong Mott-Schottky interaction occurs at their heterointerface to gain equalization, resulting in the optimization of intermediates adsorption energies, thereby favoring the reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Consequently, the proposed catalyst yields high current densities at small HER and OER overpotentials or low UOR potentials, small Tafel slopes, and desirable stability, confirming its excellent electrocatalytic activities for these key half-reactions toward significantly boosting water and urea electrolysis.

TI 2D Co3O4 stabilizing Rh nano composites developed
   for visual sensing bioactive urea and toxic p-aminophenol in
   practice by synergetic-reinforcing oxidase activity
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB To enlarge the perspective of nanozyme, 2-dimensional Co3O4 stabilizing Rh nano composite (2D Co3O4@Rh NC) was identified and developed first by one-pot surfactant-aided oxido-reduction. By virtue of the synergeticreinforcing oxidase activity between 2D Co3O4 substrate and Rh nano particles, the obtained 2D Co3O4@Rh NC could catalyze the oxidation of chromogenic substrate 3,3',5,5,'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to blue oxTMB with quite a low Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m) of 0.018 mM and a quick nu(max) of 6.45 x 10(-8) M s(-1), expressing superior oxidase-like catalysis with a wide temperature range from 20 to 60 degrees C. Importantly, either bioactive urea or toxic p-aminophenol (p-Ap) could exclusively alter the existed state of oxTMB with differentiable color changes. Under the optimized conditions, 2D Co3O4 @Rh NC was successfully applied for ratiometric colorimetric sensing urea and p-Ap in environmental water, soil and urine samples with low detection limits (1.1 mu M for urea and 0.68 mu M for p-Ap) and satisfactory recoveries (96.0-105.8%). The synergetic enhanced oxidase-like activity of 2D Co3O4@Rh NC and the different reaction mechanisms of the 2D Co3O4@Rh NC-TMB system to urea and p-Ap were investigated. Not only does the work provide an efficient way for sensing organic pollution of p-Ap, it will offer an efficient potential for diagnosing urea-related diseases on clinical medical testing in future.

TI Spout Fluidized Bed Assisted Preparation of Poly(tannic acid)-Coated

SO ACS OMEGA
AB Slow-release fertilizers (SRFs) have been widely used to reduce environment pollution derived from excessive nutrients. Coated fertilizers have been designed and prepared using various materials. However, development of new green coating materials and simple process is still a huge challenge. In this study, tannic acid (TA), a natural polyphenol, was used to prepare poly(tannic acid) (PTA)-coated fertilizers with urea prills as the core, and the technology of the coating process in a spout fluidized bed was developed. PTA coating could be formed rapidly by the fast oxidation of TA by an oxidation solution containing CuSO4 and H2O2. The coated urea release behavior was systematically studied in water and soil. In both water and soil, the release rate of nitrogen from coated urea is much slower than that from raw urea. Raw urea was completely dissolved within 30 min, while 27% of urea was released from coated urea. The pot experiments indicated that coated urea has a positive effect on the plant growth as well. Our results provide an effective method to prepare environment-friendly SRFs, indicating a promising application in sustainable agriculture.

TI Controlled synthesis of Co2P/Ni12P5@NF
   nanoarray as electrocatalyst for urea assisted hydrogen production in
   freshwater and seawater
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The research and development of environmentally friendly, stable and low cost catalyst for water electrolysis is the general trend and imminent direction. In this paper, the cobalt-nickel phosphide with nanoflake (Ni12P5 / Co2P @NF) was prepared by a simple hydrothermal reaction and low temperature phosphating process for the first time. As a catalyst for urea assisted water electrolysis, Ni12P5 /Co2P @NF exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, providing a very small overpotential of 124 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution containing 0.5 M urea. At the same time, it also present a very low Tafel slope (61.98 mA dec(- 1)), which demonstrates that the faster the rate of charge transfer is, the better the reaction is. We also tested HER performance in seawater solution containing 0.5 M urea and 1.0 M KOH, and the overpotential was 146 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the stability of the Ni12P5 /Co2P @NF material for HER was also tested for a long time, and the result showed that the catalytic performance decreased first and then was relatively stable. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that the Ni12P5 monomer presents the optimal Gibbs free energy for hydrogen, the introduction of Co2P promotes the conductivity of the electrode, and the synergistic catalysis of the Ni12P5 and Co2P promotes the electrochemistry performance of the electrode. This work proposes a novel idea and strategy for designing reasonable metal phosphide as an environmentally friendly and stable electrode.

AB This study proposed a straightforward process to synthesize 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles in which a cost-effective linker (TDI) with high reactivity was employed to couple nano-TiO2 through covalent bonding to a deep eutectic solvent (DES). By this method, DES was successfully immobilized on the TiO2@TDI surface as an adsorbent and stabilizer. The structural, morphological, and physicochemical characteristics of the synthesized nanocatalysts were evaluated using various analytical methods including Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), and elemental analysis. The heterogeneity of the catalyst was also examined by a hot filtration test. The obtained TiO2@TDI@DES nanoparticles offered superior catalytic behavior and excellent yield as well as recyclability for the chemoselective oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide using a green oxidant (hydrogen peroxide). This catalyst exhibited excellent reusability as it can be recovered for six successive cycles with no significant leach or reduction of catalytic efficiency.

TI Reaction site exchange in hierarchical bimetallic Mn/Ni catalysts
   triggered by the electron pump effect to boost urea electrocatalytic
   oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The deep exploration of real reaction sites in composite catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions has profound significance, especially in low energy cost hydrogen production coupled with the urea electrocatalytic oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, we combined non-UOR-active nano MnOx with hierarchical NiS2, which achieved high catalytic performance for UOR (over 200 mA cm(-2) at 1.9 V vs. RHE and approximately 100% UOR selectivity at 2.0 V vs. RHE). A series of rigorous experiments, including ex situ XPS, selective inactivation experiment, in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy, in situ electrochemical mass spectrometry isotope tracing experiment and DFT calculations proved that the UOR takes place at the Mn sites rather than Ni sites, and the role of Ni changes from the active site to an electrons pump. The electron pump effect proposed here provides a new idea for the design of highly efficient catalysts for most small molecular electrocatalysis.

AB Mesoporous ferrisilicates MFS-n (n = Si /Fe) with different Si/Fe molar ratio (Si/Fe = 20, 135) were synthesised by the assembly of Fe MFI nanoclusters with triblock copolymers in strongly acidic media. Au/MFS-n catalysts were prepared by deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) with a loading of gold of 1 wt%. They were characterised by various techniques including XRD, BET, FT-IR spectroscopy; diffuse reflectance UV-vis (DRUV-vis), TPR. Total oxidation of toluene was investigated on MFS-n and Au/MFS-n. The catalytic activity of MFS-n materials for total toluene oxidation is considerably enhanced as the iron content increases. The presence of gold improves the catalytic activity of MFS-n towards the combustion of toluene, the extent of this effect depending on the Si/Fe molar ratio. The catalysts are totally selective for CO2 and H2O.

TI Liquid phase oxidation of cyclopentanone over metal-free carbon
   catalysts
SO CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB Oxidation of cyclopentanone (CPO) was studied over metal-free carbon catalysts in solvent-free conditions. Norit SX plus (900 m2 g-1) and Vulcan XC72 (240 m2 g-1) were used as pristine materials. Catalysts were prepared by activation in nitrogen and by treatment with urea, calcined in nitrogen at 500 degrees C and 950 degrees C. SEM, EDX, XPS, X-ray powder diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, acid-base titration, FTIR and Raman techniques were used for characterization. Catalytic tests carried out at 0.45 MPa and 80-110 degrees C enabled to find the best results: 30% selectivity to glutaric acid (GA) and 3% to succinic acid at 25% conversion of CPO, over Vulcan type catalysts. A low activity, selectivity and strong deactivation of Norit type catalysts can be ascribed to a higher specific surface in a disordered arrangement providing a high concentration of unselective catalytic sites. A higher extent of side reactions can yield in higher molar mass products, which stick on the surface and block catalytic sites. Optimum amount of accessible planar domains, represented by graphene and/or graphitic plates with some disorders present in Vulcan type catalysts classified them superior to Norit catalysts. A redox reaction scheme of oxidation of CPO to GA is also proposed.

TI Ultrathin One-Dimensional Ni-MIL-77 Nanobelts for High-Performance
   Electrocatalytic Urea Evolution
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB During all the electrochemical energy conversion processes, the urea (CO(NH2)(2)) oxidation reaction (UOR), acting as an anode reaction in the urea electrolyzer, takes only 0.37 V to reach the equilibrium potential. As a result, the urea oxidation reaction can form a more effective hydrogen generation pathway by the coupling cathode water decomposition reaction (HER) in theory. However, limited by the harsh reaction mechanism of six-electron transfer, it is still necessary to develop catalyst materials with excellent performance and low costs to carry out efficient UOR performance. In this work, we obtained ultrathin nickel-based organic framework (MOF) nanobelts using a one-step hydrothermal method. Because of growth restrictions, not all of the six coordination sites of nickel are occupied by carboxyl groups. These metal centers with unbalanced coordination will act as active centers of the catalytic reaction, oxidizing CO(NH2)(2) and promoting the formation of CO2 and N-2.

TI Enhanced activity of urea electrooxidation on nickel catalysts supported
   on tungsten carbides/carbon nanotubes
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Nickel nanoparticles with tungsten carbides supported on the multi-walled carbon nanotubes, noted as Ni-WC/MWCNT catalyst, is prepared through an impregnation method and used for the electrooxidation of urea in alkaline conditions. The micro-morphology and composition of the Ni-WC/MWCNT particles are determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Xray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The electrooxidation activity and conductivity of the catalyst are investigated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. Characterization results indicate that the Ni nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the WC/MWCNT framework, and the Ni-WC/MWCNT catalyst shows an improved activity for the urea electrooxidation. The current densities of Ni-WC/MWCNT are over 3 times and 15 times higher than those of the Ni-WC/C and Ni/C catalysts, respectively, and the electrochemical impedance also decreases markedly. The higher activity on Ni-WC/MWCNT is attributed to the support effect of MWCNT as well as the synergistic effect between Ni and WC. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Green and rapid oxidation of aldehydes using a catalytic applications of
   Deep Eutectic Solvent
SO JOURNAL OF SAUDI CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The development of novel and environmentally friendly solvents for chemical reactions is a vital in the pursuit of sustainable chemistry. This study presents a sustainable and efficient protocol for the rapid oxidation of benzaldehyde derivatives in the presence of catalytic Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) system to their corresponding benzoic acids. A novel ternary DES composed of Urea/ZnCl2/HCl was synthesized using a combination of Urea, ZnCl2, and HCl for the first time and employed as an environmentally friendly oxidation catalyst using H2O2 as an oxidant at 60 degrees C. Benzaldehyde derivatives with diverse range of functional groups and substitution patterns afforded remarkable results, as it achieved high to excellent yields of the corresponding benzoic acids within a remarkably short reaction time of only 50 min. This protocol offers several advantages over alternative methods, including high product yields, the elimination of toxic and hazardous solvents and catalysts, and straightforward experimental procedures. Furthermore, the synthesized DES excellent recyclability, allowing for its reuse up to five times without any significant loss of functionality. Moreover, the synthesized DES demonstrated exceptional recyclability, enabling it to be reused up to five times without experiencing any notable decline in its effectiveness or functionality.

TI Controlled synthesis of Mn\M-doped NiP3/Cu3P (M=Cr, Ce, Bi and Co) as
   electrocatalysts for urea splitting reactions in alkaline solutions
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Urea is generally used in agricultural fertilization to provide nutrients they need with the crops, however overuse of urea for fertilization can pollute the environment. Electrolysis urea is a greener way of treating urea, and in recent years electrolysis urea has been studied as a hot topic. It is mainly due to the fact that the potential of urea electrolysis is 0.37 V, which is smaller than the potential of traditional water splitting of 1.23 V. In this paper, a series of synthetic experiments were carried out by doping with the same content of Cr, Ce, Bi and Co into MnNiP3/Cu3P. It is found that Cr-doped Mn-NiP3/Cu3P possesses excellent electrochemical properties compared to nickel foam doped with the other three elements. At an iR compensation value of 70 %, Mn\Cr-doped NiP3/Cu3P has strong catalytic activity and durability for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). At an ultra-low voltage of 1.352 V, the Mn\Cr-doped NiP3/Cu3P catalyst had a catalytic current of 10 mA cm- 2 , a low Tafel slope (102.03 mV dec-1), a high C dl (9.35 mF cm- 2 ), and catalytic stability of more than 50 hours. The enhanced activity of Mn\Crdoped NiP3/Cu3P is attributed to rapid charge transfer, improved electrical conductivity, and increased electrochemical area. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations showed that synergic catalytic effect of Mn-CrNiP3 and Mn-Cr-Cu3P in the catalysts can effectively improve the adsorption capacity of the catalysts, this provides a new ideas of exploration for the electrolysis of urea with cheap and relatively low toxicity catalysts, which can effectively reduce the cost.

TI Redox-Active and Urea-Engineered-Entangled MOFs for High- Efficiency
   Water Oxidation and Elevated Temperature Advanced CO2 Separation Cum
   Organic-Site-Driven Mild-Condition Cycloaddition
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Development of the multifaceted metal-organic framework (MOF) with in situ engineered task-specific sites can promise proficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and high-temperature adsorption cum mild condition fixation of CO2. In fact, effective assimilation of these attributes onto a single material with advance performance characteristics is practically imperative in view of renewable energy application and carbon-footprint reduction. Herein, we developed a three-fold interpenetrated robust Co(II) framework that embraces both redox-active and hydrogen-bond donor moieties inside the microporous channel. The activated MOF demonstrates notable OER catalysis in alkaline medium via quasi-reversible Co2+/Co3+ couple and unveils low overpotential with impressive 53.5 mV/dec Tafel slope that overpowers some benchmark, commercial, as well as contemporary materials. In particular, significantly increased turnover frequency (3.313 s-1 at 400 mV) and fairly low charge-transfer resistance (3.02 omega) compared to Co3O4, NiO, and majority of redox-active MOFs together with 91% Faradaic efficiency and notable framework durability after multiple OER cycles endorse high-performance water oxidation. Pore-wall decked urea groups benefit appreciable CO2 adsorption even at elevated temperatures with considerable MOF-CO2 interactions and exhibit recurrent capture-release cycles at diverse temperatures. Interestingly, CO2 selectivity displays radical upsurge with temperature rise, affording 40% improved CO2/N2 value of 200 at 313 K, which outperforms many porous adsorbents and delineates real-time CO2 scavenging potential. The guest-free MOF effectively catalyzes solvent-free CO2 cycloaddition with broad substrate tolerance and satisfactory reusability under relatively mild condition. Opposed to the common Lewis acid-mediated reaction, two-point hydrogen-bonding activates the substrate, as supported from controlled experiments, juxtaposing the performance of an un-functionalized MOF and fluorescence modification-derived framework-epoxide interaction, providing valuable insights on unconventional cycloaddition route in the MOF.

TI Efficient dissolution of cellulose in slow-cooling alkaline systems and
   interacting modes between alkali and urea at the molecular level
SO CARBOHYDRATE RESEARCH
AB The dissolution of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) in a urea-NaOH system is beneficial for its mechanical processing. The apparent MCC solubility was greatly improved to 14 wt% under a slow-cooling condition with a cooling rate of -0.3 degrees C/min. The cooling curve or thermal history played a crucial role in the dissolution process. An exotherm (-54.7 +/- 3 J/g MCC) was detected by DSC only under the slow-cooling condition, and the cryogenic dissolution of MCC was attributed to the exothermic interaction between MCC and solvent. More importantly, the low cooling rate promoted the dissolution of MCC by providing enough time for the diffusion of OHand urea into MCC granules at higher temperatures. The Raman spectral data showed that the intramolecularly and intermolecularly hydrogen bonds in cellulose were cleaved by NaOH and urea, respectively. XPS and solidstate 13C NMR results showed that hydrogen bonds were generated after dissolution, and a dual-hydrogen-bond binding mode between urea and cellulose was confirmed by DFT calculations. Both the decrease of enthalpy and increase of entropy dominated the spontaneity of MCC dissolution, and that is the reason for the indispensability of cryogenic environment. The high apparent solubility of MCC in the slow-cooling process and the dissolution mechanism are beneficial for the studies on cellulose modification and mechanical processing.

TI Organophosphorus Compound Formation Through the Oxidation of Reduced
   Oxidation State Phosphorus Compounds on the Hadean Earth
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION
AB Reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds may have been brought to the early Earth via meteorites or could have formed through geologic processes. These compounds could have played a role in the origin of biological phosphorus (P, hereafter) compounds. Reduced oxidation state P compounds are generally more soluble in water and are more reactive than orthophosphate and its associated minerals. However, to date no facile routes to generate C-O-P type compounds using reduced oxidation state P compounds have been reported under prebiotic conditions. In this study, we investigate the reactions between reduced oxidation state P compounds-and their oxidized products generated via Fenton reactions-with the nucleosides uridine and adenosine. The inorganic P compounds generated via Fenton chemistry readily react with nucleosides to produce organophosphites and organophosphates, including phosphate diesters via one-pot syntheses. The reactions were facilitated by NH4+ ions and urea as a condensation agent. We also present the results of the plausible stability of the organic compounds such as adenosine in an environment containing an abundance of H2O2. Such results have direct implications on finding organic compounds in Martian environments and other rocky planets (including early Earth) that were richer in H2O2 than O-2. Finally, we also suggest a route for the sink of these inorganic P compounds, as a part of a plausible natural P cycle and show the possible formation of secondary phosphate minerals such as struvite and brushite on the early Earth.

   preparation of activated carbon from sugarcane bagasse by urea phosphate
   activation
SO CELLULOSE
AB In this study, sugarcane bagasse was used to prepare urea phosphate activated carbons (UPACs) using a novel activator urea phosphate (UP) at three different temperatures (300 celcius, 550 celcius, and 800 celcius) to analyze the reaction mechanism during the pyrolysis process by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR-MS), to deduce the reaction mechanism of UP activation. Below 300 degrees C, the functional groups on the surface of sugarcane bagasse fibers undergo hydroxyl dehydration and oxidation reactions, and molecular chains were broken to produce H2O, CH4, CO2, H2, HCHO, and NH3 small molecule gas products. At 300-800 degrees C was the main temperature range for activation reactions, and the molecular structure gradually formed an ordered carbon network structure. Nitrogen-containing compounds were gradually transformed into graphite N and oxidized N as temperature increased and functional groups containing phosphorus underwent decomposition. Above 800 degrees C, the pyrolysis was basically complete. Phosphorus compounds were completely decomposed, with fewer macromolecular products and gaseous products being mainly H2O, CO2, CO, and HCHO.

TI A novel design of urea-assisted hydrogen production in
   electrochemical-chemical decoupled self-circulating systems
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB In traditional water electrolysis processes, the oxidation and reduction reactions of water are coupled in both time and space, which presents significant challenges. Here, we propose an optimized design for an electrochemical-chemical self-circulating decoupled system. This system uses the continuous Ni2+/Ni3+ redox process on nickel hydroxide electrode sheets to stepwise couple the urea oxidation-assisted hydrogen production system, separating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) into two distinct steps: electrochemical and chemical reactions. In the first electrochemical step, water is reduced at the cathode to produce hydrogen, while the single-electron electrochemical oxidation of Ni(OH)(2) at the anode generates NiOOH. Then, in the second chemical reaction step, NiOOH spontaneously oxidizes urea, causing its decomposition and simultaneously reducing back to the Ni(OH)(2) state. We concurrently investigated the effects of temperature and OH-concentration on the spontaneous oxidation of urea. At 80 degrees C and with a 1 M KOH concentration containing 50 mg of urea solution, the NiOOH electrode successfully catalyzed the spontaneous decomposition of urea, achieving conversion rate of 100% and faradaic efficiency of 98%.

TI Tailoring the local electron and modulating morphology to enhance the
   overall water splitting and urea electrolysis of CoMoO4@Cu2S
   electrocatalyst with superhydrophilicity
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Tailoring the local electron and modulating morphology are the effective ways to improve catalytic performance of the electrocatalysts. Herein, oxygen vacancy-rich CoMoO4@Cu2S heterojunction nanorod arrays electro-catalyst was successfully fabricated on copper foam (VO-CoMoO4@Cu2S HNAs/CF) via the simple solvothermal and calcination routes. The unique VO-CoMoO4@Cu2S HNAs/CF possesses extraordinary activities with an ul-tralow overpotential of 45 and 181 mV for cathodic hydrogen evolution (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution (OER), respectively, and the low potential of 1.32 V for anodic urea oxidation (UOR) at 10 mA cm- 2. More impressively, the assembled VO-CoMoO4@Cu2S HNAs/CF(+/-) cell requires merely 1.47 and 1.33 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 with superb durability for 150 h in 1 M KOH without and with urea, respectively. Multiple charac-terization and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show that the outstanding electrocatalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of the tailoring the local electron and modulating morphology.

TI Integrative metabolomic analysis reveals diet supplementation with green
   tea alleviates UVB-damaged mouse skin correlated with ascorbate
   metabolism and urea cycle
SO METABOLOMICS
AB Introduction While green tea is known to protect skin from ultraviolet (UV) light, underlying damage-repair mechanisms remain unclear.
   Objectives The major objective of this study was to investigate, using multi-omics analysis, the metabolic mechanisms associated with the effects of a diet supplemented with green tea (SGT) in UVB-damaged mice.
   Methods Six to eight weeks old female Skh: HR-1 mice were randomly divided into three experimental groups i.e., non-irradiated with control diet (NOR), UVB-irradiated with control diet (UND), and UVB-irradiated with SGT (UGD), and subjected to experimental conditions over 10 weeks. The skin samples were analyzed by metabolomics, transcriptomics, and in silico modeling.
   Results Our results revealed that SGT significantly alleviated UVB-induced metabolite alterations (aspartic acid, ornithine, ascorbic acid, ethanolamine, and C20:0-lysophosphatidylethanolamine) and gene expressions (keratin sulfate biosynthesis/degradation, fatty acid oxidation, and steroid metabolism) in the skin. Among these changes, key metabolic pathways, including ascorbate metabolism and the urea cycle, were the major pathways mitigated through SGT diet among UGD group mice. Additionally, SGT treatment also affected serum and hepatic lysophospholipid levels through attenuating and intensifying UVB-induced metabolic changes, respectively.
   Conclusion Our results suggested that the SGT diets primarily influenced ascorbate metabolism and the urea cycle in UVB-irradiated mouse skin, alleviating deleterious UVB-induced skin wrinkles, epidermal thickening, and collagen-fiber destruction.

AB Cellulose nanomaterial with rod-like structure and highly crystalline order, usually formed by elimination of the amorphous region from cellulose during acid hydrolysis. Cellulose nanomaterial with the property of biocompatibility and nontoxicity can be used for enzyme immobilization. In this work, urease enzyme was used as a model enzyme to study the surface modification of cellulose nanomaterial and its potential for biosensor application. The cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) surface was modified using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation to introduce the carboxyl group at C6 primary alcohol. The success of enzyme immobilization and surface modification was confirmed using chemical tests and measured using UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The immobilization strategy was then applied for biosensor application for urea detection. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques were used for electroanalytical characterization of the urea biosensor.

In this work, a ligand substitution strategy is used to synthesize ultrathin-nanosheet electrocatalysts of Cl-doped NiSe2 (NiSe2-a and NiSe2-b), which exhibit high-electrocatalytic activity during OER and UOR. NiSe2-a and NiSe2-b only need an overpotential of 227 and 268 mV, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) during OER. Furthermore, NiSe2-a with its smaller steric effects exhibits excellent catalytic performance for UOR, requiring an ultralow potential of 1.360 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). This excellent performance can be attributed to the nonmetallic elements (Se and Cl) modulating and optimizing the charge state of the metal sites, thereby increasing the electrocatalytic activity. Overall, this work provides an unparalleled example of tuning space structures to design efficient electrocatalysts and has promising industrial applications.

TI Study on Ship Exhaust Gas Denitrification Technology Based on
   Vapor-Phase Oxidation and Liquid-Phase Impingement Absorption
SO PROCESSES
AB A system combining gas-phase oxidation and liquid-phase collision absorption for removing NO from marine diesel engine exhaust was proposed. This method was the first to utilize different physical states of the same mixed solution to achieve both pre-oxidation and impingement reduction absorption of exhaust gases. During the pre-oxidation stage, a mixture of (NH4)2S2O8 and urea solution was atomized into a spray using an ultrasonic nebulizer to increase the contact area between the oxidant and the exhaust gas, thereby efficiently pre-oxidizing the exhaust gas in the gas phase. In the liquid-phase absorption stage, the (NH4)2S2O8 and urea solution was used in an impingement absorption process, which not only enhanced gas-liquid mass transfer efficiency but also effectively inhibited the formation of nitrates. Experimental results showed that, without increasing the amount of absorbent used, the maximum NO removal efficiency of this method reached 97% (temperature, 343 K; (NH4)2S2O8 concentration, 0.1 mol/L; urea concentration, 1.5 mol/L; NO concentration, 1000 ppm; pH, 7; impinging stream velocity, 15 m/s), compared to 72% using the conventional liquid-phase oxidation absorption method. Additionally, this method required only the addition of a nebulizer and two opposing nozzles to the existing desulfurization tower to achieve simultaneous removal of sulfur and nitrogen oxides from the exhaust gas, with low retrofitting costs making it favorable for practical engineering applications.

TI Hexagonal NiMoO4-MoS2 nanosheet heterostructure as
   a bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea oxidation assisted overall water
   electrolysis
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB For overall water splitting, easy synthesis methodologies for non-precious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with the advantages of low cost and high activity are essential. Herein, a hexagonal NiMoO4-MoS2 nanosheet heterostructure on nickel foam (NiMoO4-MoS2/NF) was synthesized by simple hydrothermal and annealing treatment. Synergies between NiMoO4 and MoS2 significantly promoted the intrinsic activity of the HER and exposed more active sites for the UOR and the HER. The NiMoO4-MoS2/NF electrocatalyst shows small electric potentials of 1.345 V for the UOR and 23 mV for the HER in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea at 10 mA cm(-2). NiMoO4-MoS2/NF has outstanding overall water splitting performance, with a low cell voltage of 1.445 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and an excellent sustainability of 24 h. The bifunctional electrocatalyst's design strategy and controllable synthesis of the hexagonal NiMoO4-MoS2 nanosheet heterostructure will benefit the overall urea water separation efficiency.

TI 3-D printed electrode integrated sensing chip and a PoC device for
   enzyme free electrochemical detection of blood urea
SO BIOELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB Herein we report a novel electrochemical sensing chip and a point-of-care device (PoC) for enzyme-free electrochemical detection of urea in human blood. The electrochemical sensing chip was developed by 3-D printing of conductive Ag ink and subsequent electrodeposition of AuNP-rGO nanocomposite. Material characterization of the sensing chip was conducted to find a plausible mechanism for the electrochemical reaction with urea. Subsequently, the response with varying concentrations of urea in solution and human blood samples was tested. High peak response current (similar to 5 times than that of the highest reported value), low impedance, rapid sensor fabrication procedure, high selectivity towards urea, excellent linear response (R-2 = 0.99), high sensitivity of 183 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), the fast response indicated by high diffusion coefficient, the limit of detection of 0.1 mu M, tested shelf life of more than 6 months and recovery rate of >99% ensured the application of the developed sensor chip towards PoC urea detection test kit. A PoC device housing an electronic circuitry following the principles of linear sweep voltammetry and compatible with a sensing chip was developed. A maximum percentage error of 4.86% and maximum RSD of 3.63% confirmed the use of the PoC device for rapid urea measurements in human blood. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hole dynamic acceleration over CdSO nanoparticles for high-efficiency
   solar hydrogen production with urea photolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Solar water splitting to hydrogen (H-2) fuel is considered a sustainable approach to meet green energy demands in the future, but is mainly limited owing to the sluggish hole dynamics involved in the water oxidation reaction and bulk charge separation. Herein, we implemented hole dynamics engineering over cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles (NPs) via the oxidation reaction substitution with a facile urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and surface conjugation with sulfurous groups (-S/SOx2-) as hole-extraction chains, which thermodynamically reduced the reaction barrier and kinetically accelerated the charge separation concomitantly. We then demonstrated a highly efficient photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER) from a urea solution with valuable urea degradation. An impressive and stable H-2 generation rate of 1.49 mmol h(-1) g(-1) was achieved under 1 sun irradiation with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of up to 2.4% at 420 nm. In this study, we designed CdSxO NP photocatalysts to enable hole thermodynamic and kinetic acceleration, which promise a cost-effective and course-smooth solar H-2 production along with urea-rich wastewater purification.

TI Nitrogen-doped Hollow Carbon Hemisphere Supporting PtSn Nanoparticles
   with a Tunable Microstructure to Effectively Improve Electrocatalytic
   Performance for Ethanol Oxidation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Herein, a series of nitrogen-doped hollow carbon hemispheres (HCHs) were prepared using silica as template, asphalt and urea as carbon and nitrogen source. The obtained different nitrogen content HCHs were then applied for supports of PtSn nanoparticles catalyst for ethanol oxidation in acid media. The PtSn nanoparticles were evenly deposited on HCHs with a narrow size distribution. Tunable size and distribution of the PtSn catalysts were obtained by adjusting nirtrogen content. Among all the synthesized PtSn catalysts, nitrogen content was the highest when the mass ratio of asphalt to urea was 2:1. The electrochemical analysis illustrated that the catalyst with highest nirtrogen content presented best electrocatalytic activity and stability for ethanol oxidation in acid media, providing that the HCHs with unique hollow structure and optimum nitrogen doping content can effectively improve the ethanol electrocatalytic activity and stability.

TI Facile and scalable synthesis of 2D porous Ni/C via a
   salt-template assisted approach for enhanced urea oxidation reaction and
   energy-saving hydrogen production
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Urea splitting has gained increasing attention for energy-saving hydrogen production. The development of inexpensive, efficient and durable nanostructured electrocatalysts is highly desired to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Nickel-containing materials have emerged as inexpensive and promising electrocatalysts for UOR in recent years. Herein, a series of cost-effective composites consisting of different loadings of Ni nanoparticles anchored on two-dimensional (2D) porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as Ni/CS) were fabricated for UOR via a facile and eco-friendly salt template-assisted approach. Among the prepared Ni/CS composites, the 4-Ni/CS sample with a suitable nickel loading and optimum structures exhibited the best UOR performances with a low potential of 1.369 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, an overall urea splitting cell with the optimized 4-Ni/CS as the anode catalyst delivered only 1.372 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which was 200 mV lower than the pure water splitting cell. The enhanced performances of 4-Ni/CS for UOR and the urea splitting cell were mainly attributed to its larger electrocatalytic specific area, more abundant active sites and defects, and faster mass transfer. The remarkable 2D porous 4-Ni/CS electrocatalyst exhibits potential application in UOR and energy-saving hydrogen production.

TI Hierarchical CoFe LDH/MOF nanorods array with strong coupling effect
   grown on carbon cloth enables efficient oxidation of water and urea
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) play important roles in the fields of hydrogen energy production and pollution treatment. Herein, a facile one-step chemical etching strategy is provided for fabricating one-dimensional hierarchical nanorods array composed of CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) supported on carbon cloth as efficient and stable OER and UOR catalysts. By precisely controlling the etching rate, the ligands from Co-MOFs are partially removed, the corresponding metal centers then coordinate with hydroxyl ions to generate ultrathin amorphous CoFe LDH nanosheets. The resultant CoFe LDH/MOFs catalyst possesses large active surface area, enhanced conductivity and extended electron/mass transfer channels, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. Additionally, the intimate contact between CoFe LDH and MOFs modulates the local electronic structure of the catalytic active site, leading to enhanced adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates to facilitate fast electrocatalytic reaction. As a result, the optimized CoFe LDH/MOF-0.06 exhibits superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 276 at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term durability. Additionally, it merely requires a voltage of 1.45 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution with 0.33 urea and is 56 mV lower than the one in pure KOH. The work presented here may hew out a brand-new route to construct multi-functional electrocatalysts for water splitting, CO2 reduction, nitrogen reduction reactions and so on.

TI Insights over the in-situ grown copper sulfide/NiFe-LDH composites for
   alkaline and urea water electrolysis
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Harnessing hydrogen fuel through electrocatalytic water splitting offers an eco-friendly alternative to the traditional fossil fuels. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are the two half-cell reactions, that make up the electrocatalytic water splitting. Replacing the sluggish OER in the electrocatalytic water splitting with less energy demanding urea oxidation reaction (UOR) might benefit overall water splitting with reduced cell voltages. On the other hand, developing electrodes based on non-precious metals is essential for cost-effective and efficient water splitting. Herein, composites comprising non-precious nickel iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) and copper (II) sulfide (CuS) are grown over the nickel foam and subjected to electrochemical measurements for alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) and urea water electrolysis (UWE). Structural and morphological investigations reveal that the 10 wt% CuS composited NiFe-LDH (NFCS10) is supposed to have effective catalytic features for water electrolysis. The electrochemical investigations in the three-electrode system with silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl, reference electrode) and platinum (Pt, counter electrode) revealed that the NFCS10 requires only a minimal overpotential (eta(50)) of 235 mV for UOR and 400 mV for OER respectively. For bifunctional performance, NFCS10 requires an overall cell potential (O-CP) of 1.65 V and 1.50 V to reach 10 mA/cm(2) current density in AWE and UWE, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifies the enrichment of oxygen vacancies in NiFe-LDH:CuS heterostructure, which could influence the charge transport and stability of the proposed electrode. This study emphasizes the interfacial interactions between the LDH and metallic sulfide, as well as their impact on the electrocatalytic activity in alkaline and urea water splitting.

TI Defect-activated ternary carbon composite: A multifunctional
   electrocatalyst for efficient oxidation of water, urea, glucose, ORR,
   and zinc-air batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Designing a low-cost multifunction electrocatalyst that can synergistically catalyze multiple reactions in alkaline media while operative for long periods is of paramount importance for the hydrogen economy. Particularly, defect-activated electrocatalysts can significantly improve electrolytic performance by altering their chemical properties and electronic structures. However, developing defect-rich electrocatalysts with multiple active sites for efficient electro-oxidation of water remains challenging. In this respect, we present a straightforward strategy to design a defect-activated multifunctional ternary carbon composite by integrating graphene oxide (GO), Mxene (Mx), and graphitic carbon nitride (CN). Benefiting from the well-integrated 2D interfacial coupling of different carbon nanostructures, carbon composite has several advantageous properties including superior electric conductivity, higher specific surface area, activated surface defects, and highly accessible multicomponent surface-active sites. In addition, carbon composite exhibited macroporous 3D architecture for free migration of oxygen species and electrons. Accordingly, the carbon composite served as a multifunctional electrocatalyst in alkaline media, displaying superior electrolytic activities toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Moreover, the Znair batteries (ZABs) fabricated with Zn anode and carbon composite as air-cathode demonstrated to have a highpower density, high discharge voltage, and excellent cycling stability in alkaline media. The exceptional electrolytic performance is attributed to the defect-rich interfaces and the synergistic interactions between the multicomponents of carbon composite, which not only facilitate free accessible volume for rapid diffusion of oxygenrelated species but also maintain the structural integrity during the reaction, thus allowing its comparable fast reaction kinetics. Overall, this work presents a simple and scalable strategy to design an efficient, stable, and ecofriendly multifunctional electrocatalyst that has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications in energy conversion and storage.

SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB In this study, synthesis and characterization of an acidic-hydrogen bonding dual role and recover-able catalyst [Fe3O4 @SiO2 @(CH2)3-urea-dithiocarbamic acid] was reported. The catalyst was character-ized with several techniques such as Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), elemental mapping (Mapp), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis. Also, to review the catalytic performance of Fe3O4 @SiO2 @(CH2)3-urea-dithiocarbamic acid, we investigated the catalytic synthesis of new pyridones with 1,2,3-triazole moiety. Good yield of products, recovering and reusability of catalyst and mild reac-tion conditions can be considered as the advantages of the described catalytic system. An anomeric-based oxidation mechanism is suggested for the last step of the preparation of desired molecules.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Morphology-Controlled Fabrication of Co3O4
   Catalysts and Performance Towards Low Temperature CO Oxidation
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB This article reports the heterogeneous catalysis of CO oxidation over nanostructured Co3O4 at low temperatures. The hydrothermal method was deftly exploited to fabricate nanostructured Co3O4 with three kinds of precipitants (i.e., urea, hexamethylene tetramine, and sodium hydroxide), which were thoroughly characterized with XRD, BET, TEM/SEM, HR-TEM, H-2-TPR, and XPS to understanding the correlation between the morphology of Co3O4 and the corresponding catalytic performance. Specifically, the straw-like nanorods, flower-like nanosheets, and honeycomb-like nanoparticles of Co3O4 could be controlled with the choice precipitants. Our comprehensive analysis indicated that the straw-like Co3O4 nanorods possessed preferential performance for CO catalytic oxidation among these nanostructured Co3O4 to produce CO2. In addition, the results showed good long-term stability for practical application over the straw-like Co3O4 nanorods and showed no significant decay (the activity maintained 97% conversion) within 50 h at 125 degrees C. The novel insights of low-temperature CO oxidation on nanostructured Co3O4 from this work could hold promise for the development of new strategies and design principles for manufacturing highly active and stable catalysts.

TI Gold-TiO2-Nickel catalysts for low temperature-driven CO
   oxidation reaction
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Nickel-doped-TiO2 catalysts were prepared by the solgel method and surface modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by the urea-deposition-precipitation technique. The as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman and XPS spectroscopies, N-2 physisorption, STEM-HAADF microscopy and TPR hydrogen consumption. The Au/TiO2-Ni catalysts were evaluated catalytically performing CO oxidation reactions. The catalyst with nickel content of 1 wt. % (Au/TiO2-Ni 1) showed the highest CO conversion with respect to the high-nickel-content or bare/commercial TiO2 at 0 degrees C. In situ DRIFTS showed a strong participation of both nickel due to the presence of surface-nickel-metallic nanoparticles formed during the CO adsorption process at reaction temperatures above 200 degrees C, and surface-bridged-nickel-CO species. A minor deactivation rate was observed for the Au/TiO2-Ni 1 catalyst in comparison with the Au/TiO2 one. The oxygen vacancies that were created on the solgel-doped TiO2 improved the catalytic behavior during the performance of CO oxidation reactions, and inhibited the AuNP sintering.

TI Synergetic Modulation of Electronic Properties of Cobalt Oxide via "Tb"
   Single Atom for Uphill Urea and Water Electrolysis
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Exploring single-atom (SA) catalysts in hybrid urea-assisted water electrolysis offers a viable alternative to both Hydrogen (H-2) generation and polluted water treatment. However, the unfavorable electronic stabilization, low SA content, intrinsically slow kinetics, and imbalanced adsorption-desorption steps are the bottleneck for its scale-up implementation. Herein, a rare-earth Terbium single atom (Tb-SA) is topologically stabilized on defect-rich Co3O4 (Tb-SA@d-Co3O4) by TbO co-ordination for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and H-2 evolution reaction (HER). Benefitting from the strong Tb-SA interaction with the d-Co3O4, the Tb-SA@d-Co3O4 achieves a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at 1.27 V and -35 mV for UOR and HER, respectively. Remarkably, when Tb-SA@d-Co3O4 is applied as a bi-functional catalyst in a two-electrode system, it merely requires 1.22 V to acquire 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent operational stability for 100 h. The hybrid electrolyzer can be successfully empowered by the triboelectric nanogenerator, AA battery, and solar panel with a nominal potential of 1.5 V. The mechanistic investigation predicts "Tb-SA" insertion in d-Co3O4 lowered the potential determining step, attributed to balanced reaction energetics for adsorption-desorption of intermediates and favorable charge transfer characteristics for UOR. This work offers a new paradigm to explore the catalytic properties of rare-earth "f-block" elements to create advanced electrocatalysts via structural modulation.

TI Bi-functionality of mesostructured MnCo2O4
   microspheres for supercapacitor and methanol electro-oxidation
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB In this work, we describe the synthesis of hierarchically mesoporous MnCo2O4 microspheres via a urea-assisted co-precipitation method, followed by a post-annealing treatment in air. The stoichiometric amount of urea serves as a self-template to favor the self-assembly of hierarchically well-organized, 3D interconnected precursor carbonate microspheres under optimized reaction conditions. An electrode fabricated from micro/nano-structured MnCo2O4 delivers an excellent multi-functional electrochemical performance when used in supercapacitors and methanol electro-oxidations. The electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1857 F/g at a 5 mV/s scan rate, and 97% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Also, as an electro-catalyst for methanol oxidation, it maintains an optimum current density up to 95 A/g. The superior electrochemical performance might be attributed to its three-dimensional interconnected porous architecture, which offers a rapid ion/electron transfer, and structural stability. The synthesis method adopted in the present study is simple, controllable, and easy to carry out at a production scale. Furthermore, the superior electrochemical performance of the as-obtained MnCo2O4 microspheres renders them a potential candidate for various energy applications.

TI RELEASE OF AMMONIA AND GREENHOUSE GASES ALONG MOISTURE GRADIENT FROM
   MANURE AND UREA APPLIED FARGO SILTY CLAY SOIL
SO APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE
AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) [nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4)] emission and ammonia (NH3) volatilization from organic and commercial fertilizers are likely related to soil moisture levels. Effect of soil moisture [(30%, 60%, and 90% water-holding capacity (WHC)] on emissions from urea and manure treated (215 kg ha(-1)) Fargo-Ryan silty clay soil was studied under laboratory conditions. Soils (250 g) amended with solid beef manure (SM), straw-bedded solid beef manure (BM), urea (UR), and control (CT) were incubated for 28 days at 22 +/- 1 degrees C, to determine GHGs (N2O, CO2, and CH4) emission and NH3 volatilization loss. The cumulative emission of N2O-N, CO2-C, and CH4-C ranged from 27 to 4402 mu g N2O-N kg(-1), 272 to 2030 mg CO2-C kg(-1), and 10.1 to 1389 mu g CH4-C kg(-1) soil, respectively. The daily fluxes and cumulative emissions of N2O and CO2 generally followed the decreasing order of 30% < 90% < 60% of WHC. At 60% WHC, 1.01% of the total applied N was lost as N2O from urea treated soil. Carbon dioxide emission from manure treated soil (SM and BM) was up to two times the emission from UR treated soils. The Fargo clay soils showed higher CH4 emission at 90% WHC level. The cumulative NH3 volatilization loss from soil ranged from 29.4 to 1250.5 mu g NH3-N kg(-1), with the highest loss from UR amended soils at 30% WHC. These results suggest that gaseous emissions from manure and urea application under laboratory study are influenced by moisture levels of Fargo-Ryan silty clay soil.

TI Ultrafine NiFe clusters anchored on N-doped carbon as bifunctional
   electrocatalysts for efficient water and urea oxidation
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Hydrogen production through electrocatalysis is crucial in renewable energy technologies but significantly impeded by sluggish anodic reactions. Developing bifunctional anode noble-metal-free electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to boost cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is promising but challenging to meet different reaction media and multiple applications for simultaneous clean energy production and pollution treatment. Herein, a facile one-pot thermal treatment strategy is presented to anchor NiFe nanoclusters (with a size of about 2 nm) on N-doped carbon as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both OER and UOR. Such an electrocatalyst can deliver a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) with a low overpotential of 260 mV and a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) for OER, superior to the state-of-the-art Ru-based materials. Besides, this electrocatalyst also shows excellent activity for UOR with the need for just 1.37 V (vs. RHE) to attain a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). In a two-electrode electrolyzer for both cathodic HER and anodic UOR, only a cell voltage of 1.50 V is required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 140 mV lower than that of overall water splitting electrolysis (1.64 V). The excellent electrooxidative performance can be attributed to the improved conductivity, abundant active sites and fast charge transfer and transport benefiting from the ultrafine structure of NiFe clusters and their synergistic effect with N-doped carbon.

TI Low loading platinum dispersed on Ni/C nanoparticles as high active
   catalysts for urea electrooxidation reaction
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Ni/C, Ni90Pt10/C and Ni95Pt5/C (Ni:Pt atomic ratios of 90:10 and 95:5) nanoparticles were investigated for urea electrooxidation reaction (UER) in alkaline media. The catalysts nanoparticles were synthesized by sodium borohydride reduction and galvanic replacement methods with 20 wt% of metals loading on carbon. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses showed the presence of peaks attributed to the Ni-0, Ni(OH)(2) and Pt. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images show nickel nanoparticles with an average size of about 6 nm, platinum nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm as well as platinum atoms spread on the carbon and nickel. The electromagnetic magnetic measurements results of the materials revealed that the addition of platinum to nickel change its magnetic properties, which is associated to the transfer of electrons from platinum to nickel 5d band. The catalytic activity of the materials was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) measurements. The Ni90Pt10/C material showed the highest catalytic activity for UER, on both CV and CA experiments. The higher catalytic activity of the Ni90Pt10/C could be due to a change of urea electrooxidation pathway in which platinum atoms might play an important role in order to oxidize intermediates formed during the UER, and also due to the modification of the electronic properties of nickel which could decrease the energy of poisoning species adsorption on the catalyst's surface.

TI Metal-organic framework-based materials as key components in

SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Studies have extensively addressed the development of electrocatalytic technologies for energy storage and conversion, fuel production, and environmental protection. Electrode processes such as different oxi-dation and reduction reactions play a vital and significant role in these technologies. In this regard, effi-cient, inexpensive, and stable electrocatalysts capable can significantly promote electrochemical reactions. Unique features of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) such as their high porosity, tunable structure, size, and pore shape, high surface area, and redox properties have introduced them as an ideal electrocatalyst candidate. This review is thus aimed at elucidating the role of MOF-based materials (pris-tine, derivatives and composites) as efficient electrocatalysts in energy and sensing-related oxidation and reduction reactions such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), alcohol oxidation reaction (AOR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) in advanced energy and sensing devices. Also, the structure-property relationship of the electrocatalyst was elaborated for each electro-catalytic reaction. Finally, perspectives on the potential research topics for practical use of MOF-based electrocatalysts are addressed. The present review can improve the interest in MOF-based electrocata-lysts to study different oxidation and reduction reactions in energy and sensing systems.(c) 2023 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China, and Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd.

TI In situ construction of WNiM-WNi LDH (M = Se, S, or P)
   with heterostructure as highly efficient electrocatalyst for overall
   water splitting and urea oxidation reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Electrochemical water splitting as an important means of obtaining high purity hydrogen fuel has attracted great interest. In this study, the structural engineering of complex WNiM-WNi LDH (M = Se, S, or P) was firstly developed by in situ growth on Ni foam for use in overall water splitting and the urea oxidation reaction. These WNiM-WNi LDH (M = Se, S, or P) catalysts exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. An overpotential of only 64 mV of OER is required for WNiS-WNi LDH and 126 mV of HER is required for WNiP-WNi LDH to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). The WNiSe-WNi LDH materials display a particularly outstanding performance for UOR, requiring a potential of 1.25 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the optimized WNiS-WNi LDH as an anode and WNiP-WNi LDH as a cathode can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.45 V in 1 M KOH solution for overall water splitting. The density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of the NiP2 and WP material greatly reduces the Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen adsorption of the material.

TI Simultaneously Tuning Charge Separation and Surface Reaction Kinetics on
   ZnIn2S4 Photoanode by P-Doping for Highly
   Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting and Urea Oxidation
SO SEPARATIONS
AB ZnIn2S4 nanosheets are a promising photoanode for driving photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen fuel production; nevertheless, poor charge separation and sluggish surface reaction kinetics hinder its PEC performance to an extreme degree. Herein, a facile element doping strategy (i.e., P element) was developed to obtain the desired photoanode. As a result, the ZnIn2S4-P (ZIS-P-5) photoanode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent density of 1.66 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE) and a much lower onset potential of 0.12 V vs. RHE for water oxidation. Careful electrochemical analysis confirms that the P doping and sulfur vacancies (Sv) not only facilitate the hole transfer, but also boost surface reaction kinetics. Finally, the "killing two birds with one stone" goal can be achieved. Moreover, the optimized photoanode also presents high PEC performance for urea oxidation, obtaining a photocurrent density of 4.13 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. This work provides an eco-friendly, simple and effective method to realize highly efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion.

TI The effect of ageing on bonding performance of plasma treated beech wood
   with urea-formaldehyde adhesive
SO CELLULOSE
AB In the process of wood bonding, the usage of aged and inactivated wooden elements can cause a reduction in mechanical properties of products containing wood-adhesive joints. Treating wood with an atmospheric air plasma represents a sophisticated technique for surface activation. With this regard, to enhance the bondability of normal beech wood (Fagus sylvatica L.) with urea-formaldehyde (UF) adhesive, a dielectric barrier discharge plasma in floating electrode configuration was implemented. In this study, fresh and aged wood specimen both, untreated and plasma treated, were investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed promotion of carbon-rich species with ageing, but generation of a new functional oxygen-containing functional groups after plasma treatment. Microscopic observations with scanning electron microscope showed no obvious changes in the wood structure after plasma treatment. Surface oxidation consequently improved the wettability of the wood surface with water and UF adhesive. However, this enhanced wettability slightly diminished over time. As shown with dynamic mechanical analysis, the rheological properties of the UF adhesive in wood-adhesive joints were not affected by aging nor by plasma treatment. The positive influence of plasma treatment and negative impact of substrate ageing to the shear strengths of wood lap-joints were determined using an automated bonding evaluation system. Similarly, the negative effect of wood ageing and the positive effect of plasma pre-treatment were reflected in the bending strengths of the produced laminated veneer lumbers. Results showed that plasma treatment of beech wood improves the bonding performance of both fresh and aged wood. Graphic abstract

SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB In the presented study, we developed a new and efficient strategy for the synthesis of coumarin-linked nicotinonitrile derivatives via a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation mechanism. Target compounds were prepared through a four component reaction between aldehyde derivatives, 2-acetyl-3H-benzo[f]chromen-3-one or 3-acetylcoumarin, malononitrile or ethyl cyanoacetate and ammonium acetate, in the presence a catalytic amount of Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)(3)-urea-benzimidazole with sulfonic acid tags as a recoverable nanomagnetic catalyst. All reactions proceed smoothly with good to high yields under solvent free conditions. Graphic abstract Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3-urea-benzimidazole with sulfonic acid tags shows elegant catalytic activity for the preparation of coumarin linked nicotinonitrile derivateives via a cooperative vinylogous anomeric based oxidation mechanism.

TI Anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to arsenate reduction, a novel
   biogeochemical process observed in arsenic-contaminated paddy soil
SO GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
AB Anaerobic ammonium oxidation represents an important pathway of N loss, which can be coupled with reduction of nitrite and metal(loid)s (e.g., Fe(III) and Mn(IV)). Similar to Fe(III) and Mn(IV), As(V) is also an active metal(loid) and ammonium oxidation coupled with As(V) reduction is thermodynamically feasible. However, little is known about this poten-tial process. In this study, anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled with As(V) reduction, designated as Asammox, was observed in cultures inoculated from As-contaminated paddy soil using N-15 isotope tracer analysis. Compared with the treat-ment amended with N-15-urea only, the production of N-15-labeled N-2 (i.e., N-30(2) and N-29(2)) was significantly greater in the treat-ment amended with As(V) and N-15-urea. Furthermore, the abundances of the genes encoding for arsenate reductase (arrA) and hydrazine synthase (hzsB) were significantly higher in the treatment amended with As(V) and N-15-urea than those in the treatment amended with N-15-urea only. In addition, putative Asammox bacteria affiliated with Halomonas, Pelagibacterium, and Chelativorans were identified by DNA-stable isotope probing. Members of Ca. Brocadia were the most dominant Anam-mox bacteria in the soil cultures and may interact with Asammox bacteria in ammonium oxidation, suggesting that the N loss may be attributed to the contribution of Asammox and Anammox in the As-contaminated soil. The observation of Asam-mox, a novel biogeochemical process, and identification of bacteria responsible for this biogeochemical process expands the fundamental understanding of both N and As biogeochemical cycling. In addition, this study provides a proof-of-concept for investigating anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled with metal(loid)s reduction by combining stable isotope probing and isotope tracer microcosm incubations.

TI Nickel Oxide Immobilized on the Carbonized Eggshell Membrane for
   Electrochemical Detection of Urea
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been known as a viable method for renal/liver disease diagnostic detection. Here, we reported a three-dimensional (3D) nickel oxide nanoparticles dressed carbonized eggshell membrane (3D NiO/c-ESM) as a modified electrode toward urea detection. Several common physical measurements were employed to confirm its structural and morphological information. NiO/c-ESM modified electrode exhibits an outstanding performance for urea determination with a linear range from 0.05 to 2.5 mM, and limit detection of similar to 20 mu M (3 sigma). This work offered a green approach for introducing 3D nanostructure through employing biowaste ESMs as templates, providing a typical example for producing new value-added nanomaterials with urea detection.

TI A Low-Cost Fertilizer Medium Supplemented with Urea for the Lutein
   Production of Chlorella sp. and the Ability of the Lutein to
   Protect Cells against Blue Light Irradiation
SO BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB This study aimed to investigate the use of organic fertilizers instead of modified f/2 medium for Chlorella sp. cultivation, and the extracted lutein of the microalga to protect mammal cells against blue-light irradiation. The biomass productivity and lutein content of Chlorella sp. cultured in 20 g/L fertilizer medium for 6 days were 1.04 g/L/d and 4.41 mg/g, respectively. These values are approximately 1.3- and 1.4-fold higher than those achieved with the modified f/2 medium, respectively. The cost of medium per gram of microalgal biomass reduced by about 97%. The microalgal lutein content was further increased to 6.03 mg/g in 20 g/L fertilizer medium when supplemented with 20 mM urea, and the cost of medium per gram lutein reduced by about 96%. When doses of >= 1 mu M microalgal lutein were used to protect mammal NIH/3T3 cells, there was a significant reduction in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the cells in the following blue-light irradiation treatments. The results show that microalgal lutein produced by fertilizers with urea supplements has the potential to develop anti-blue-light oxidation products and reduce the economic challenges of microalgal biomass applied to carbon biofixation and biofuel production.

   reactions
SO JOURNAL OF POROUS MATERIALS
AB Using post grafting method, two hybrids composite materials were prepared by anchoring Nickel and Zinc Schiff base complexes onto amino-modified MCM-41(Ni-MCM-41 and Zn-MCM-41). The prepared catalysts have been characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The catalysts showed excellent catalytic efficiency in oxidation reaction of sulfides to sulfoxides and oxidative coupling of thiols to their corresponding disulfides using urea hydrogen peroxide as oxidant under mild reaction conditions. The supported Schiff base complexes can be recovered easily and reused many times without significant loss in catalytic activity and selectivity.

TI Combustion simulations of aqueous urea ammonium nitrate monofuel at high
   pressures
SO COMBUSTION AND FLAME
AB This paper describes a high pressure combustion mechanism of aqueous urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) monofuel. Simulation results were validated by comparison to experiments at pressures of 1-25 MPa and residence times of up to 450 s using a PFR model. Results showed agreement for nitrogen-based species above 15 MPa. For carbon-based species close agreement between experiments and simulations was observed at all pressures. In several conditions, experimental trends were successfully reproduced in the simulation results. Increased pressure and residence time were both found to have a positive effect on pollutant reduction. However, the pressure effect was found to be dominant. A sensitivity analysis was used to identify potential pressure dependent rate limiting reactions during combustion. Different reaction pathways were prominent at 5 and 25 MPa in agreement with the experimental trends. This paper supports the importance of carrying UAN combustion at high pressure to minimize pollutants emission, thereby achieving an environmentally friendly process.

TI Amine-Functionalized Graphene-Rich NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide
   Nanostructure for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Water and Urea Oxidation
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Development of green technologies for hydrogen generation is crucial but is hindered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A nickel-iron metal-based layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) has emerged as an efficient material as an OER catalyst, but the standalone material is lacking due to its poor conductivity and a sluggish mass transfer process. Herein, a functionalized aminated graphene-rich nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH@NH2-G) nanocomposite was successfully synthesized with a one-pot coprecipitation method that demonstrates onset potentials of 0.41 and 0.32 V for both OER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively, and both are lower than those of NiFe-LDH and NiFe-LDH@rGO under similar conditions. Moreover, the catalyst shows a mass activity of 0.356 mA mg(-1) at 1.49 mV for the OER, which is 6.6 times higher than that of NiFe-LDH, and for the UOR, the mass activity was 0.368 mA mg(-1) at 1.49 mV, which is 4.8 times higher than that of NiFe-LDH. The catalyst shows the lowest Tafel value of 49 mV dec(-1) and possesses a high turnover frequency of 2.92 x 10(-1) S1- for the OER. The aminated graphene-functionalized catalyst shows the lowest overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) compared to those of NiFe-LDH@rGO (300 mV) and NiFe-LDH@Graphene (290 mV) for the OER. The excellent catalytic activity is attributed to the incorporation of functionalized aminated graphene, which improves the electronic structure of the composite with the successful integration of nitrogen into the carbon matrix. The amine is an electron-withdrawing group, and its incorporation can eliminate the oxygen functional groups which increases the C/O ratio thereby enhancing the conductivity of the graphene layers, making a good case for the electrocatalyst. This is the first ever report where an aminated graphene-based nanocomposite is shown to have exceptional electrocatalytic activity and will is an important step toward design of a future electrocatalyst for OER and UOR.

TI One-step corrosion inducing the amorphous/crystalline-Co0.8Ru0.2/ RuCoOx
   heterostructures for urea-assisted water decomposition at ampere-level
   current density
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB It is challenging to directionally construct the amorphous/crystalline (a/c)-alloy/oxide heterostructures with exceptional bifunctional electrocatalytic performances via a facile method. With these in mind, the a/c-RuCo NWs/NF electrode with the unique hollow structure and a/c-Co0.8Ru0.2/RuCoOx heterostructure was constructed by cleverly controlling the corrosion time. As expected, the well-designed a/c-RuCo NWs/NF||a/c-RuCo NWs/NF only needs 1.46 V to reach an industrial-grade current density of 1 A cm- 2, outperforming other advanced electrodes. Strikingly, density functional theory (DFT) and in-situ Raman reveal that the Ru delta+-Ru0 dual-sites and Co delta+ at the a/c-Co0.8Ru0.2/RuCoOx heterointerface act as active species for alkaline HER and UOR, synergistically promoting urea-assisted water splitting. Surprisingly, the unique Co0.8Ru0.2 alloy exhibits the potential to surpass the pure Ru metal in optimizing d-band centers and the adsorption of reaction intermediates. Overall, the a/c-alloy/oxide bifunctional electrode with Ru delta+-Ru0-Co delta+ multi-active sites was constructed by one-step corrosion, providing a new idea for designing efficient a/c-alloy/oxide electrodes and realizing industrial urea-assisted water splitting.

TI A composite of graphitic carbon nitride and Vulcan carbon as an
   effective catalyst support for Ni in direct urea fuel cells
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB A g-C3N4/VC composite material comprising of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and Vulcan carbon (VC) with different ratios, i.e., 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 were prepared through hydrothermal method without using any additives. These composite materials were further utilized as a support for Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles. These materials formed new type of Ni/(g-C3N4/VC) composite materials. The SEM images show the sheet-like structure of the graphitic carbon nitride. Although Ni nanoparticles' electrochemical activity over the surface for graphitic carbon nitride was slightly more compared to Ni supported on the Vulcan carbon, the Ni supported on the different composite supports demonstrated an outstanding activity compared with that over the single supports. Among the different composite ratios of the graphitic carbon nitride to the Vulcan carbon, the one with high Vulcan carbon, i.e., 2:1, exhibited the best performance that is nine-times the current density in comparison to that of Ni over Vulcan carbon at 0.5 V using 2 M urea in 1 M potassium hydroxide. The stability for the prepared Ni over the composite support was high, where the degradation in the current density for more than 2 hours was negligible.

TI Urea-glass preparation of titanium niobium nitrides and subsequent
   oxidation to photoactive titanium niobium oxynitrides
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Titanium niobium oxynitrides (TiNbON) are an attractive category of potential photocatalysts, but strategies for preparing them remain limited. We adapt the wet chemical "urea glass" method for pure transition metal nitrides to single-phase mixed-metal titanium niobium nitrides for a range of niobium mole fractions. We then oxidize the nitrides by heating in air to prepare titanium niobium oxynitride that absorbs visible light of lambda <= 550 nm. The materials are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy. Their photochemical activity as a function of Nb fraction is benchmarked with methylene blue photomineralization promoted by full-spectrum AM 1.5G solar irradiation with and without a lambda <= 400 nm cut-on filter. First-order Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate constants for photomineralization reveal a composition with similar to 8% Nb to have superior reactivity. Full compositional analysis by Kjeldahl chemical nitrogen determination and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy yields a chemical formula of Ti0.92Nb0.08O1.97N0.03. Finally, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy correlates a localized Nb4+ defect with increased photochemical reaction rate.

TI Highly Conductive Non-Calcined 2D Cu0.3Co0.7
   Bimetallic-Organic Framework for Urea Electrolysis in Simulated Seawater
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Global clean energy demands can be effectively addressed using the promising approach of hydrogen energy generation combined with less energy consumption. Hydrogen can be generated, and urea-rich wastewater pollution can be mitigated in a low-energy manner using the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). This paper seeks to assemble a unique electrocatalyst of a pristine 2D MOF, [Co(HBTC)(DMF)] n (Co-MUM-3), from 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) to oxidize urea in simulated seawater. Ni foam (NF)-based working electrodes were fabricated by incorporating a series of heterometallic CuCo-MUM-3 frameworks (Cu0.1Co0.9-MUM-3, Cu0.2Co0.8-MUM-3, Cu0.3Co0.7-MUM-3, and Cu0.4Co0.6-MUM-3), after which their application in the urea oxidation reaction was examined. A very low required overpotential [1.26 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl (simulated seawater) + 0.33 M urea] and a Tafel slope of 112 mV dec-1 could be observed for the Cu0.3Co0.7-MUM-3 electrocatalyst, ensuring the achievement of urea electro-oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions at a corresponding 10 mA cm-2 electrocatalytic current density. A relatively lower overpotential will be evident compared to other reported pristine MOFs, outperforming the commercial catalyst RuO2 (1.41 V at 10 mA cm-2, 131 mV dec-1) and ensuring considerable stability at significantly high current densities for a minimum of 72 h.

SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)(3)-urea-quinoline sulfonic acid chloride, as a novel and efficient nanomagnetic catalyst bearing urea linkers, was designed, synthesized and then fully characterized by using various techniques. To investigate the catalytic activity of the described catalyst, it was used for the synthesis of coumarin containing 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs), through a condensation reaction of aromatic aldehydes, 4-hydroxycoumarin, and ammonium acetate under solvent-free conditions. This procedure includes important aspects like simple procedure, simplicity of product isolation using water, decreasing the temperature of reaction, disuse of solvent, high to excellent yields, environmentally benign reaction conditions and short reaction times. Also, the presented catalyst was recycled and reused for at least five times with only a negligible decrease in its catalytic activity. The applied catalyst has both acidic and H-bond donor-acceptor sites so that it can use as a dual role catalytic system. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the effects of V dopant on the structural, electrochemical, and theoretical properties of free-binder CoP/nickel foam (NF) electrodes are explored for supercapacitors, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) applications. By increasing the vanadium dopant concentration, the sheet-like morphology of CoP/NF transforms to a dual morphology (spherical and sheet-like morphology), showing the best electrochemical performance including a specific capacitance of 3740 F g- 1 at a current density of 1 A g- 1. The CoVP (10:1)/NF//activated carbon capacitor stores the electrochemical energy with the energy density of 24 Wh kg- 1 at a power density of 1400 W kg- 1 and shows 100 % capacity retention after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at the current density of 20 A g- 1. Additionally, the impact of V-dopant on the pristine CoP is evident in the quantum capacitance (CQ), in which the CoVP (10:1) has the highest CQ of 1812 F g- 1 at a potential of -0.04 V. The CoVP (10:1)/NF electrode depicts superior OER performance with an overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm- 2. Additionally, the CoVP (10:1)/NF electrode requires the potential of 1.28 V vs. RHE to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm- 2 for UOR. The electrochemical properties of CoP material are enhanced by V dopant through modulating the microstructure and electrical conductivity.

TI Synthesis of FeCo2O4@Co3O4 nanocomposites and their electrochemical
   catalytical performaces for energy-saving H2 prodcution
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB In this study, FeCo2O4@Co3O4 bifunctional catalysts with a unique structure combining nanosheets and nanowires were prepared on nickel foam by a simple hydrothermal + annealing method. The catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen pro-duction during urea electrooxidation reaction (UOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). For UOR, the potential at 10 mA/cm2 current density is 1.387 V and the tafel slope is 67 mV/ dec. In the configured two-electrode electrolytic cell, the FeCo2O4@Co3O4 catalysts in the UOR and EOR processes required only 1.425 and 1.471 V, respectively, to produce a current density of 10 mA/cm2, which is much less than that of the (oxygen evolution reaction) OER (1.640 V). In addition, the current density remained stable at a fixed potential during a long time (20 h) i-t test in the urea solution.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effect of increased enteral protein intake on plasma and urinary urea
   concentrations in preterm infants born at &lt; 32 weeks gestation and
   &lt; 1500 g birth weight enrolled in a randomized controlled trial - a
   secondary analysis
SO BMC PEDIATRICS
AB Background: Feeding breast milk is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality, as well as improved neurodevelopmental outcome but does not meet the high nutritional requirements of preterm infants. Both plasma and urinary urea concentrations represent amino acid oxidation and low concentrations may indicate insufficient protein supply. This study assesses the effect of different levels of enteral protein on plasma and urinary urea concentrations and determines if the urinary urea-creatinine ratio provides reliable information about the protein status of preterm infants.
   Methods: Sixty preterm infants (birthweight < 1500 g; gestational age < 32 weeks) were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial and assigned to either a lower-protein group (median protein intake 3.7 g/kg/d) or a higher-protein group (median protein intake 4,3 g/kg/d). Half the patients in the higher-protein group received standardized supplementation with a supplement adding 1.8 g protein/100 ml milk, the other half received individual supplementation depending on the respective mother's milk macronutrient content. Plasma urea concentration was determined in two scheduled blood samples (BS1; BS2); urinary urea and creatinine concentrations in weekly spot urine samples.
   Results: The higher-protein group showed higher plasma urea concentrations in both BS1 and BS2 and a higher urinary urea-creatinine-ratio in week 3 and 5-7 compared to the lower-protein group. In addition, a highly positive correlation between plasma urea concentrations and the urinary urea-creatinine-ratio (p < 0.0001) and between actual protein intake and plasma urea concentrations and the urinary urea-creatinine-ratio (both p < 0.0001) was shown.
   Conclusions: The urinary urea-creatinine-ratio, just like plasma urea concentrations, may help to estimate actual protein supply, absorption and oxidation in preterm infants and, additionally, can be determined non-invasively. Further investigations are needed to determine reliable cut-off values of urinary urea concentrations to ensure appropriate protein intake.

TI Ni-Co bimetal decorated carbon nanotube aerogel as an efficient anode
   catalyst in urea fuel cells
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Ni-based catalysts have been considered as an efficient anode material for urea fuel cells due to the low cost and high activity in alkaline media. Herein, we demonstrate that Ni-Co bimetallic nanoparticles decorated carbon nanotube aerogels as catalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can be synthesized by a polyol reduction and sol-gel method. The morphology, structure, and composition of the Ni-Co/MWCNT aerogels were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-Ray diffraction. The electro-catalytic activity of the Ni-Co/MWCNT aerogels towards UOR was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the Co-doping at 25% (Co/Ni) significantly increased the oxidation peak current and reduced the overpotential of the UOR. Furthermore, the MWCNT aerogel support also remarkably enhanced electro-catalytic activity by providing a high surface area and fast mass transport for the UOR owing to the porous 3D network structures with uniform distribution of Ni-Co nanoparticles. Urea/O-2 fuel cell with Ni-Co/MWCNT aerogel as anode material exhibited an excellent performance with maximum power density of 17.5 mWcm(-2) with an open circuit voltage of 0.9 V. Thus, this work showed that the highly porous three-dimensional Ni-Co/MWCNT aerogel catalysts can be used for urea oxidation and as an efficient anode material for urea fuel cells.

TI Surface adsorbed-H2O promoted aerobic oxidation of
   biomass-derived alcohols on MnOx  catalysts
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Manganese oxides (MnOx) x ) have been emerged as highly active catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of biomass- derived compounds. Herein, a facile urea-redox hydrothermal method was employed to scalable synthesis of MnOx x oxides with surface abundant unsaturated Mn and O species. The defective MnOx x (MnOx-D) x - D) catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance, enabling the room-temperature aerobic oxidation of biomass-derived alcohols with yields exceeding 99%. This represents a substantial 90.8-fold increase in activity compared to commercial MnO2. 2 . Moreover, MnOx-D x - D catalyst demonstrates broad substrate scopes for various biomass-derived alcohols and displays recyclability for the aerobic oxidative conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) over five cycles. Through a comprehensive analysis involving X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in-situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and controlled experiments, it is established that the presence of surface-adsorbed H2O 2 O species on MnOx-D x - D catalyst significantly influences its catalytic performance. Mechanism studies reveal that the aerobic oxidation of biomass-derived R-CH2-OH 2 - OH compounds into the corresponding aldehydes can proceed via radical and non-radical pathways. Notably, the catalytic activity of MnOx-D x - D catalyst in both pathways is mediated by the surface adsorbed H2O 2 O species. In the radical route, surface adsorbed H2O 2 O and O2 2 species are converted into active center dot OH radical species, while in the non-radical route, surface adsorbed H2O 2 O can form a complex of HMF--H2O 2 O species. Both processes enhance the abstraction of H from the O-H and C-H bonds in the R-CH2-OH 2 - OH compounds on MnOx-D x - D catalyst. This discovery could potentially guide the development of efficient metal oxidic catalysts for the oxidation of biomass-derived R-CH2-OH 2 - OH compounds.

TI CuFe2O4 modified expanded graphite synthesized by
   urea-assisted hydrothermal method for tetracycline treatment through
   persulfate activation: Characterization, mechanism and degradation
   intermediates
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Owing to the stable crystal structure and wide range of pH applications, CuFe2O4 particles have been intensively concerned in the field of advanced oxidation, but their serious agglomeration and slow catalytic efficiency are still the stumbling blocks. The composite catalyst (EG-CuFe2O4-U) prepared by urea-assisted hydrothermal method with expanded graphite (EG) as the substrate immobilized CuFe2O4 not only exposed more active sites but also exhibited a higher electron transfer rate. Additionally, EG-CuFe2O4-U showed excellent performance in degrading tetracycline (TC) in model wastewater by activated peroxydisulfate (PDS). The synthesis mechanism of EG-CuFe2O4-U and the principle of urea in the formation of reduction environment were discussed in detail by the experimental results of key preparation parameters and characterization. Meanwhile, several critical influencing factors were examined including PDS concentration, catalyst dosage, initial pH of the solution, and the change of pH in different systems. Furthermore, the removal efficiency and mineralization efficiency of TC (50 ppm) exceed 91% and 34.6%, on the conditions of 0.4 gL(-1) EG-CuFe2O4-U, 6 mM PDS, initial solution pH of 4, and room temperature. What's more, the internal reaction mechanism of free radicals and non-free radicals in the EG-CuFe2O4-U/PDS system was further elaborated via scavenging tests, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Finally, based on twenty-one principal intermediates of TC, four possible degradation pathways were proposed. In general, the catalyst with a rich pore structure and high catalytic activity has great potential in the effective activation of PDS and is prospective to be further applied in the field of antibiotic wastewater degradation.

TI Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols in Low Melting Mixtures and
   Water and Use for Telescoped One-Pot Hybrid Reactions
SO CHEMISTRYOPEN
AB An efficient, selective and sustainable protocol was developed for the CuCl2/TEMPO/TMEDA-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of activated alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds using water or the environmentally friendly low melting mixture (LMM) d-fructose-urea as the reaction medium. Such oxidation reactions proceed under mild (room temperature or 40 degrees C) and aerobic conditions, with the carbonyl derivatives isolated in up to 98 % yield and within 4 h reaction time when using the above-mentioned LMM. The potential application of this methodology is demonstrated by setting up useful telescoped, one-pot two-step hybrid transformations for the direct conversion of primary alcohols either into secondary alcohols or into valuable nitroalkenes, by combining oxidation processes with nucleophilic additions promoted by highly polarized organometallic compounds (Grignard and organolithium reagents) or with nitroaldol (Henry) reactions, respectively.

TI Au/LaPO4 nanowires: Synthesis, characterization, and
   catalytic CO oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Au/M-P-O (M=Mg, Al, Ca, Fe, Co, Zn, La) catalysts were prepared by loading ca. 1 wt.% gold onto commercial metal phosphate supports by deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU), and tested in CO oxidation. Au/La-P-O showed the highest activity, achieving complete CO conversion at 70 C. Au/Ca-P-O was the second most active, achieving complete CO conversion at 155 degrees C. The remaining catalysts were not active below 200 C. In view of the results, we additionally prepared Au/LaPO4 nanowires by loading ca. 1 wt.% gold onto LaPO4 nanowires via DPU. The Au/LaPO4 nanowires catalyst was even more active, achieving complete CO conversion at 15 degrees C. The catalysts were characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature-programmed desorption of O-2 or CO2 (O-2-TPD, CO2-TPD). Reasons for the higher activity of Au/LaPO4 nanowires were discussed. (C) 2016 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cyanamide-Modified Iron (III) Oxide Photocatalysts for Degradation of
   Phenol in the Presence of Urea and Formaldehyde
SO SAINS MALAYSIANA
AB Cyanamide as the source of carbon and nitrogen was used to modify iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) photocatalyst. While X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed that the cyanamide-modified Fe2O3 photocatalysts have comparable crystallinity to that of the unmodified Fe2O3, the diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DR UV-vis) spectra obviously showed additional light absorption around 500-800 nm on the cyanamide-modified Fe2O3, resulting in a better absorption capability under visible light irradiation. The presence of cyanamide modifier decreased the fluorescence emission intensity of Fe2O3, implying the reduced electron-hole recombination on the Fe2O3 and/or blocked emission sites by the modifier. The presence of carbon and nitrogen on the modified Fe2O3 photocatalysts was confirmed by the elemental analyzer. Photocatalytic activities of Fe2O3 and cyanamide-modified Fe2O3 were then evaluated for degradation of phenol under UV and visible light irradiation. Modification of Fe2O3 with cyanamide significantly improved the degradation of phenol from 30 to 75% under UV light irradiation and from 0 to 80% under visible light irradiation. Photocatalytic degradation of phenol was also investigated in the presence of urea or formaldehyde or both urea and formaldehyde. Even though the percentage of phenol degradation decreased in the presence of other pollutants, it was demonstrated that cyanamide modified iron(III) oxide photocatalysts still gave good activity towards degradation of phenol even in the presence of other organic pollutants.

TI Defect-rich Ni(OH)2/NiO regulated by WO3 as
   core-shell nanoarrays achieving energy-saving water-to-hydrogen
   conversion via urea electrolysis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Constructing low-cost, high-efficient, and stable electrocatalysts is crucial for large-scale and sustainable water-to-hydrogen conversion. Herein, the combination approaches of hydrothermal, annealing and electrodeposition have been used to fabricate a novel defect-rich electrocatalyst, Ni(OH)(2)/NiO-C/WO3 HAs, that is composed of WO3 core with Ni(OH)(2)/NiO shell hierarchical arrays (HAs), which exhibits relatively large specific surface area and thus exposing abundant defect sites. Additionally, both experimental and computational results reveal that the regulation of the electronic structure of W6+ contributes to inducing Ni centers to reform and transform into active species. The unique Ni(OH)(2)/NiO-C/WO3 HAs possess extraordinary activities with an ultralow over-potential of 53 mV for cathodic hydrogen evolution (HER), and the low potential of 1.340 V for anodic urea oxidation (UOR) at 10 mA cm(-2). When employing Ni(OH)(2)/NiO-C/WO3 HAs as symmetric electrolyzer in a hybrid water electrolysis system, the cell voltage reduces to 1.370 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the electrolytic cell remains stable over 60 h at 20 mA cm(-2), outperforming the commercial counterpart of Pt/C||IrO2. This study provides a promising pathway to design high-efficient electrocatalysts for energy-saving water-to-hydrogen conversion via urea electrolysis.

TI Fabrication of a highly effective electrochemical urea sensing platform
   based on urease-immobilized silk fibroin scaffold and aminated glassy
   carbon electrode
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was successfully functionalized with amine groups (-NH2) through the electrooxidation of carbamic acid, to produce an aminated GCE. The aminated GCE could be effectively used to detect current changes during the urease-catalyzed decomposition of urea. The silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds were used to place urease near the surface of the aminated GCE (urease/SF/aminated GCE). The prepared electrode was employed for electrochemical urea sensing utilizing cyclic voltammetry and amperometry techniques. The fabricated sensing platform displayed rapid detection response and high sensitivity of 112.3 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) with a linear correlation between current and urea concentrations (0.3-2.7 mM). Values for limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were estimated to be 0.163 mM and 0.394 mM, respectively. The reproducible sensing responses recorded using the urease/SF/aminated GCE comprising replaceable SF discs (generated and functionalized with urease in the same batch) assure the suitability of the present platform for application in urea sensing devices.

TI Laboratory Evaluation of Metal Elements Urease Inhibitor and DMPP
   Nitrification Inhibitor on Nitrogenous Gas Losses in Selected Rice Soils
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB Urea is considered as the most widely used nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Unfortunately, its application is associated with losses such as emissions of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in a gas form. In addition to the economic loss, such N losses may threaten atmospheric quality. Application of both urease and nitrification inhibitors is advocated as an approach to mitigate these gaseous losses. Thus, laboratory studies were carried out to evaluate the effects of urease inhibitor-coated urea, nitrification inhibitor-coated urea, and other modified urea fertilizers on NH3 volatilization and N2O gas emissions in selected anaerobic rice soils. Copper (Cu) and Zinc (Zn) were selected as urease inhibitors and DMPP (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate) as nitrification inhibitor. Nitrogen fertilizer treatments used were urea, Cu-coated urea (CuU), Zn-coated urea (ZnU), Cu + Zn-coated urea (CuZn), DMPP-coated urea (DMPPU), DMPP + Cu + Zn-coated urea (DMPPCuZn), OneBaja, sulfur-coated urea (SU), and dolomite-coated urea (DU). Results demonstrated that CuU, ZnU, DMPPCuZn, SU, and OneBaja were effective in reducing NH3 volatilization by 12.12-37.48 % compared to urea, while DMPPU had no effect on NH3 volatilization. Meanwhile, sulfur-coated urea (SU), CuU, ZnU, CuZn, OneBaja, DMPPU, and DMPPCuZn reduced N2O emission over urea by 14.86, 17.57, 21.62, 29.73, 29.73, 33.78, and 48.64 %, respectively. These results suggest that using Cu, Zn, or combinations of DMPP, Cu, and Zn is recommended as an alternative to mitigate both NH3 volatilization and N2O emission, in addition to providing positive impact to environment.

TI Modulation of the morphology and electronic structure of
   Ni3S2 nano-forests via P and Mo co-doping
   in polyoxometalates to promote the urea oxidation reaction
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Heazlewoodite nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) is a promising catalyst for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) due to its facile fabrication and low cost. However, the low active sites inhibit the UOR activity of pure Ni3S2. Doping is an effective strategy to modify the active site of an electrocatalyst. Herein, a theory-guided strategy is used for screening the doping elements, and the results indicate that P and Mo co-doping contributes most to enhancing the UOR activity of Ni3S2. Then, P and Mo co-doped Ni3S2 (P-Mo-Ni3S2@NF) is synthesized using polyoxometalate PMo12O40 center dot xH(2)O as the precursor. Experimental/theoretical results demonstrate that P and Mo co-doping can regulate the morphology and electronic structure, accelerate electron transfer, increase the Ni3+ active sites of Ni3S2, improve the conductivity, and strengthen the urea adsorption and *COO desorption. Consequently, the P-Mo-Ni3S2@NF electrode shows a decent UOR activity and stability, i.e., reaching 1 A cm(-2) at a potential of 1.53 V. This work can inspire more insights into doping modification of UOR electrocatalysts.

TI Enhancement of urea removal from reclaimed water using thermally
   modified spent coffee ground biochar activated by adding
   peroxymonosulfate for ultrapure water production
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB To enhance the degradation of urea in reclaimed water for producing ultrapure water (UPW), thermally modified biochar (TBC) was prepared by secondary pyrolysis using spent coffee biochar with the function as an activator of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Results showed that 94.4% of urea can be degraded effectively by the TBC-PMS system at the dosage of 0.4 g/L TBC and 2 g/L PMS under neutral and weak acid conditions. Moreover, urea removal mainly depended on the free radical pathway (SO4 center dot- and OH center dot), especially OH center dot. The inorganic anions of TBC increased via secondary pyrolysis, especially carbonate and phosphate, resulting in higher electrical conductance (EC) value than the original biochar. It was conducive to activating PMS. As well, C-O, -OH worked as an active site in the TBC-PMS system, providing electrons and activating PMS. This work provides a novel strategy for UPW production using TBC-PMS system.

TI Energy-efficient hydrogen production over a high-performance
   bifunctional NiMo-based nanorods electrode
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Electrochemical water splitting to hydrogen fuel is highly desirable yet challenging mainly limited by sluggish cathodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Urea electrolysis can produce hydrogen more energysavingly by replacing OER process with urea oxidation reaction (UOR) due to favorable thermodynamic potential, however lacking efficient UOR catalysts restricts the industrial application. Here we reported novel NiMo-based nanorods, Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/MoO3, by thermal ammonolysis of NiMo-based precursor as excellent catalyst for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with small overpotentials of 252 mV, and 103 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, the Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/MoO3 shows fabulous catalytic UOR activity with a low potential of 1.349 V at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming most recently reported non-noble metal catalysts and commercial RuO2. More importantly, the cell voltage of urea electrolysis using Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/MoO3 as cathode for HER and anode for UOR is significantly reduced from 1.52 V of traditional water electrolysis to 1.356 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability for over 400 h, superior to almost recently reported catalysts. The high performances result from the synergistic effect between highly active and conductive metal nickel and nitride, and nanorods arrays grown on 3D substrate. This work demonstrates that this material holds encouraging potential in largescale energy-saving H-2 production and urea-related wastewater treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI In-situ prepared NiMoO4 nanocrystals synergizes with nickel micro-tubes
   with hydrodynamic effects for energy-saving watersplitting
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Coupling hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can significantly reduce the cell voltage, but also alleviate the environmental pollution caused by urea. We prepared NiMoO4 nanocrystals (NC) in situ and cooperated with the hydrodynamics effect of nickel-micro tubes (NT), so that nanocrystals growing inside and outside the tube wall can fully react with electrolyte under the effect of flow field during the process of liquid flow, and achieve the best catalytic activity. Significantly, NiMoO4 NC400/NT as electrode in coupled system achieving an ultralow cell voltage. And DFT calculations suggested a lattice oxygen involved urea oxidation reaction pathway with Ni-Mo site as the active site. Our approach can give a straightforward synthesis method for in-situ nanocrystal preparation, as well as break the shackles of standard water electrolysis and provide a new way to produce energy-saving hydrogen.

TI Metronidazole and Cephalexin degradation by using of
   Urea/TiO2/ZnFe2O4/Clinoptiloite
   catalyst under visible-light irradiation and ozone injection
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS
AB Cephalexin (CEX) and metronidazole (MNZ) degradationwere photodegraded using the synthesized Urea/TiO2/ZnFe2O4/-Clinoptiloite catalyst under visible light irradiation. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VisDRS) and photoluminescence (PL) analysis approved themodification of TiO2 byUrea and ZnFe2O4 compounds increased the absorption edge of catalyst to 590 nm and decreased the electron-hole recombination rate. The results showed the degradation efficiencies of ozonation process for the metronidazole and cephalexin removal were obtained 36% and 39%, respectively. The photocatalyst activity of Urea/TiO2/ZnFe2O4/Clinoptiloite (Zeolite) under visible light irradiation was determined 70% for metronidazole and 74% for cephalexin degradation. Furthermore, the combination of ozonation process and photocatalyst degradation under visible light irradiation showed high potential for the antibiotics degradation (94% for metronidazole and 95% for cephalexin) due to the increase in the generation of reactive species and synergistic effect between photocatalysis and ozonation processes. The response surfacemethodology (RSM) results revealed the removal efficiency of both pollutants were highly dependent on pH, irradiation time, catalyst concentration and initial antibiotics concentration. First order kinetics model descripted the degradation process and the rate constants were 0.0196 and 0.0243 min(-1) for the metronidazole and cephalexin removal, respectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

   Tetraamide Phthalocyanine and Its Application for Aerobic Oxidation of
   Hydrocarbons and Alcohols
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB The activation of oxygen for selective oxidation of organic molecules, such as hydrocarbons and alcohols, remains a major catalytic challenge. We have developed a catalytic system combiningN-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) with cobalt tetraamide phthalocyanine [CoPc(CONH2)(4)] for the oxidation of hydrocarbons and alcohols at 75 degrees C under an oxygen atmosphere. CoPc(CONH2)(4)was synthesized by trimellitic anhydride-urea method, and its structure was confirmed by FT-IR, UV-Vis and XRD. This catalyst, in synergy with NHPI/O(2)system, exhibited excellent catalytic ability and high selectivity in the oxidation of hydrocarbons and alcohols. Based on the experimental results, a reasonable reaction mechanism was proposed for the oxidation of alkanes and alcohols, respectively.
   Graphic Abstract
   Cobalt tetraamide phthalocyanine (CoPc(CONH2)(4)) was synthesized by a simple solid-thermal method, and the synergistic catalysis oxidation of NHPI and CoPc(CONH2)(4)was studied. A synergistic catalysis system for the aerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons and alcohols byN-hydroxyphthalimide combined with cobalt tetraamide phthalocyanine has been developed.

TI Efficient CO (carbon monoxide) oxidation using gold catalysts supported
   on WO3/titanate protonated nanotubes
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB WO3/titanate protonated nanotubes used to disperse gold nanoparticles were prepared by the deposition-precipitation with urea method and tested in CO oxidation reaction. Remarkably enhanced CO oxidation activity was achieved with the addition of gold nanoparticles with respect to WO3/NT and Au/NT catalysts. XPS and H-2/TPR showed that when the samples were activated at 400 degrees C under hydrogen treatment, gold was present in the metallic Au form and tungsten as W5+ and W6+ species; likewise, the addition of tungsten to the tubular morphology led to the formation of vacancies and new adsorption sites, preserving the structure at up to 400 degrees C. The interaction between WO3 and the titanate nanotubes was improved by adding gold nanoparticles with sizes around 1 and 3 nm under hydrogen treatment, increasing the content of reduced W5+ species that promoted the CO oxidation at low temperatures. The 2Au-3WO(3)/NT catalyst was active from 0 degrees C and showed temporary stability at room temperature.

TI Whole Body Protein Oxidation Unaffected after a Protein Restricted Diet
   in Healthy Young Males
SO NUTRIENTS
AB Protein oxidation may play a role in the balance between anabolism and catabolism. We assessed the effect of a protein restricted diet on protein oxidation as a possible reflection of whole body protein metabolism. Sixteen healthy males (23 +/- 3 years) were instructed to use a 4-day isocaloric protein restricted diet (0.25 g protein/kg body weight/day). Their habitual dietary intake was assessed by a 4-day food diary. After an overnight fast, a 30 g C-13-milk protein test drink was administered, followed by 330 min breath sample collection. Protein oxidation was measured by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. To assess actual change in protein intake from 24-h urea excretion, 24-h urine was collected. During the 4-day protein restricted diet, the urinary urea:creatinine ratio decreased by 56 +/- 9%, which is comparable to a protein intake of 0.65 g protein/kg body weight/day. After the protein restricted diet, 30.5 +/- 7.3% of the 30 g C-13-milk protein was oxidized over 330 min, compared to 31.5 +/- 6.4% (NS) after the subject's habitual diet (1.3 +/- 0.3 g protein/kg body weight/day). A large range in the effect of the diet on protein oxidation (-43.2% vs. +44.0%) was observed. The residual standard deviation of the measurements was very small (0.601 +/- 0.167). This suggests that in healthy males, protein oxidation is unaffected after a protein restricted diet. It is uncertain how important the role of fluctuations in short-term protein oxidation is within whole body protein metabolism.

TI Synthesis of Sterically Encumbered Thiourea S-Oxides through
   Direct Thiourea Oxidation
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Thiourea S-oxides can be viewed as formal analogs of the currently unknown diamino-substituted Criegee intermediates (urea O-oxides). However, the preparation of such S-oxides is rather challenging, and the direct oxidation of thioureas typically only leads to formation of desulfurized products. Employing the accurate revDSD-PBEP86-D4 double hybrid density functional, it was found that the peracid mediated oxidation of thiourea S-oxides exhibits a lower reaction barrier than the oxidation of the corresponding thiourea itself in contrast to most other ordinary thioketones. The undesired overoxidation reactivity, which is associated with strong pi-donation from the thiourea's nitrogen atoms, can be partially suppressed by introduction of bulky substituents and the utilization of protic solvents. In this regard, we managed to prepare two sterically encumbered thiourea S-oxides in isolated yields of 35-40 %. The S-oxides are stable in the solid state and in alcoholic solutions at room temperature for extended periods of time, but swiftly decompose in aprotic solvents by disproportionation. A dimesityl-substituted thiourea S-oxide complexed with residual mCBA could be characterized by means of X-ray crystallography, confirming the importance of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of the amino-substituted C=S+-O- moiety.

TI Adjusting the Structure-Activity Relationship of MOFs to Obtain
   Electrocatalysts with Higher Hydrogen Evolution and Urea Oxidation
   Performance by Introducing Different Linkers
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Three kinds of metal-organic frameworks possessing analogous structures were prepared by regulating the structure units of organic linkers. MOF/nickel foam electrocatalysts were formed by in situ hydrothermal growth of MOFs on a clean supported substrate nickel foam (NF), and the corresponding composites were prepared. We phosphatated them and obtained the heterojunction catalyst. Different structure units in the ligand have significant influences on the phosphating, resulting in heterogeneous materials that are not quite the same. Among them, heterogeneous materials with Co2P and NiP have the best catalytic performance. We also studied the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) properties of the materials and proved that it is feasible to improve the UOR performance of MOF/NF composites by regulating the structure units in the organic linkers. The results provided an idea for the reasonable selection of organic ligands to construct MOFs to regulate the electrocatalytic performance.

TI Remediation of CO by oxidation over Au nanoparticles supported on mixed
   metal oxides
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The efficiency of gold supported on Mn2O3-Fe2O3 mixed oxides in the preferential oxidation of CO to CO2 in H-2 rich streams and in total oxidation is influenced by the particle size of gold. The mixed oxide precursors were prepared by co-precipitation. Gold nanoparticles were supported on the mixed oxides by deposition-precipitation technique using urea. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed that the oxides formed during calcination of oxide precursors at 550 degrees C were Mn2O3 and Fe2O3. Gold particles with an average size of 3.7 nm produced a 99.5% CO conversion in the presence of hydrogen at 80 degrees C using 1 vol.% CO and 2 vol.% O-2 with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 12 000 h(-1)for preferential oxidation. The catalysts were also tested in a simulated reformate feed stream. The addition of 15 vol% CO2 to the feed caused reduction in the conversion of CO, while the introduction of 8.8 vol% H2O did not affect CO conversion, but mitigated the negative effect of CO2. All catalysts showed complete CO conversion up to 250 degrees C in total CO oxidation experiments when sufficient oxygen was supplied to the system.

TI Defective ferrocene-based metal-organic frameworks for efficient
   solar-powered water oxidation via the ligand competition and etching
   effect
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks are considered to be promising electrocatalytic materials due to their ultrathin lamellar structure, ultrahigh porosity and large surface area, but there are still many challenges such as the embedding of organic ligands leading to low density of active sites and poor conductivity. Herein, we synthesize two-dimensional ferrocene-based metal-organic frameworks nanosheet electrocatalysts via the onestep hydrothermal hydrogen peroxide etching method. The prepared FcNi-BDC-H2O2/NF exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance with a current density of 100 mA center dot cm-2 at only 258 mV and a small driving potential of 1.542 V (10 mA center dot cm-2) is required to achieve overall water splitting. Significantly, an overall watercracked cell using a solar cell assembly achieves the solar hydrogen conversion efficiency of 19.5%. The introduction of high electronegativity ferrocene and the etching of H2O2 increase the Ni3+ content of FcNi-BDC-H2O2, and expose more unsaturated active sites, which improve the intrinsic activity of the catalysts and the mass transfer rate during the catalytic process. Moreover, the FcNi-BDC-H2O2/NF demonstrates significant urea oxidation reaction performance, achieving a potential of 1.35 V and producing 10 mA center dot cm-2. This study presents a viable approach to investigating highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction and urea oxida-tion reaction using MOF-based bifunctional catalysts.

TI Interfacial engineering of the hetero-coordinated Ru-O-M clusters in
   MOF/ LDH structures for boosting urea-assisted water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) assisted water splitting has attracted tremendous interests for efficient hydrogen production, but the sluggish reaction kinetics still hinders its extensive application. Herein, the well-defined Ru clusters anchored on metal-organic framework (MOF)/layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterointerface (Ru@MOF/LDH) was prepared via an interface-induced strategy. By hydrolyzing the MOF precursor, confined sites-rich intermediate MOF/LDH heterostructure formed, providing numerous anchor sites to confine Ru. Inspiringly, monodispersed Ru clusters and hetero-coordinated Ru-O-M bonds successfully fabricated on the heterointerface between MOF and LDH. Benefiting from the well-designed Ru clusters, Ru-O-M bonds and multicomponent synergistic effect, the blossom-like Ru@MOF/LDH exhibited outstanding activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR bifunctionality in alkaline electrolyte. Optimized Ru@MOF/LDH displayed an ultra-low overpotential of 84.7 mV for HER to reach 10 mA cm- 2 and only with the potential of 1.44 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm- 2 for UOR. For a two-electrode electrolyser, Ru@MOF/LDH drove a ureaassisted water splitting to reach 10 mA cm- 2 at a low cell voltage of 1.4 V, which was superior to most of the reported LDH-based catalysts. This work provides profound insights for designing the MOF-based heterostructure electrocatalysts, further improving catalytic performance.

TI Cobalt Encapsulated in Nitrogen-Doped Graphite-like Shells as Efficient
   Catalyst for Selective Oxidation of Arylalkanes
SO MOLECULES
AB Selective oxidation of ethylbenzene to acetophenne is an important process in both organic synthesis and fine chemicals diligence. The cobalt-based catalysts combined with nitrogen-doped carbon have received great attention in ethylbenzene (EB) oxidation. Here, a series of cobalt catalysts with metallic cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in nitrogen-doped graphite-like carbon shells (Co@NC) have been constructed through the one-pot pyrolysis method in the presence of different nitrogen-containing compounds (urea, dicyandiamide and melamine), and their catalytic performance in solvent-free oxidation of EB with tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as an oxidant was investigated. Under optimized conditions, the UCo@NC (urea as nitrogen source) could afford 95.2% conversion of EB and 96.0% selectivity to acetophenone, and the substrate scalability was remarkable. Kinetics show that UCo@NC contributes to EB oxidation with an apparent activation energy of 32.3 kJ/mol. The synergistic effect between metallic cobalt NPs and nitrogen-doped graphite-like carbon layers was obviously observed and, especially, the graphitic N species plays a key role during the oxidation reaction. The structure-performance relationship illustrated that EB oxidation was a free radical reaction through 1-phenylethanol as an intermediate, and the possible reaction mechanistic has been proposed.

TI Dual cation-modified hierarchical nickel hydroxide nanosheet arrays as
   efficient and robust electrocatalysts for the urea oxidation reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The rational modification of electronic structures to create catalytically active sites has been proved to be a promising strategy to efficiently facilitate the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, a well-defined nanosheet arrays catalyst of Ni(OH)2 doped with dual cations of Co and Mn on Ni foam (NF) (Co/Mn-Ni(OH)2) is synthesized through a simple hydrothermal process. Benefiting from the advantages of unique structures and modified binding strengths, it is found experimentally that the obtained Co/Mn-Ni(OH)2 catalyst only requires a potential of 1.38 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm-2 and exhibits a small Tafel slope of 35 mV dec-1, outperforming single-component-incorporated Ni(OH)2. Moreover, the catalyst has shown excellent stability for 25 h at a current density of 50 mA cm-2. Additionally, first-principles calculations demonstrate that the co-incorporation of Co and Mn remarkably lowers the adsorption barrier of CO(NH2)2* on the catalyst surface, and accelerates the dissociation of the CO(NH2)2* intermediate into CO* and NH* intermediates, which synergistically improve the UOR reaction kinetics. This work provides a generic paradigm for designing advanced and effective catalysts toward the UOR.

TI Cerium phosphate-supported Au catalysts for CO oxidation
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB LaPO4 and hydroxyapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) are typical metal phosphates recently found to be useful for making supported metal or metal oxide catalysts, but CePO4 (also belonging to the metal phosphate family) has been rarely used to make supported catalysts. It would be interesting to develop CePO4-supported catalysts and explore their catalytic applications. Herein, hexagonal CePO4 nanorods (denoted as CePO4-H), hexagonal CePO4 nanowires (CePO4-HNAW), monoclinic CePO4 nanoparticles (CePO4-M), and monoclinic CePO4 nanowires (CePO4-MNW) prepared by different methods were used to support gold via deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU). The gold contents of these catalysts were all around 1 wt%. The catalytic activities of these Au/CePO4 catalysts in CO oxidation were found to follow the sequence of Au/CePO4-MNW > Au/CePO4-HNW > Au/CePO4-M > Au/CePO4-H. These catalysts were characterized by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), N-2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) to find possible correlations between the physicochemical properties and catalytic activities of these catalysts.

TI Facile in-situ growth of Ni2P/Fe2P nanohybrids on

SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Urea electrolysis is regarded as an alternative energy-saving hydrogen production technique to replace the conventional water splitting method due to the predicted lower thermodynamic potential. Herein, we demonstrate a robust and mass-produced strategy to in-situ grow Ni2P/Fe2P nanohybrids on Ni foam (Ni2P/Fe2P/NF) as an advanced electrode for overall urea electrolysis via a 30 s manual shaking reaction of FeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O, K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] and pre-treated NF, followed by a facile phosphorization treatment. The as prepared Ni2P/Fe2P/NF electrode exhibits high activity for the HER at 115 mV and UOR at 1.36 V with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and only a cell voltage of 1.47 V is required to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work reveals a promising industrializable pathway to develop non-noble materials as bifunctional catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Atomically dispersed Pt single sites and nanoengineered structural
   defects enable a high electrocatalytic activity and durability for
   hydrogen evolution reaction and overall urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The scarcity and high cost of PGM electrocatalysts are the key bottleneck in the mass-scale commercialization of many electrolysis technologies. Bifunctional single-atom electrocatalysts (SACs) are promising alternatives for PGM electrocatalysts in next-generation electrolysis technologies because of their superior intrinsic activity and perfect atom utilization. Regulating the coordination environment of platinum atomic sites identifies their electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, exploring more appropriate supports could facilitate the construction of active and durable electrocatalysts with ultralow noble metal content. Herein, we report on a reliable approach for producing a novel type of SACs composed of atomically dispersed Pt active sites stabilized on defective NiCo layered double hydroxide (Pt/D-NiCo LDH) nanosheets as an ultralow-Pt hybrid electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and full urea-water electrolysis. The optimized Pt1/D NiCo LDH-24 SAC displays a remarkable HER and UOR performance where it yields a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 37 mV and 1.25 V vs. RHE for HER and UOR, respectively. Symmetrical urea electrolyzer constructed of Pt1/D-NiCo LDH-24 electrodes attains 10 mA cm-2 at a cell voltage of 1.32 V vs. RHE, demonstrating superior activity and durability over 60 h operation when compared to commercial Pt/C(+)||RuO2 (-) system.

TI Preparation and characterization of cellulose nanocrystals with high
   stability from okara by green solvent pretreatment assisted TEMPO
   oxidation
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Because the traditional preparation methods of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) involve chemical pollution issues, in this study, two typical green solvents, alkali/urea solvent (AUS) and deep-eutectic solvent (DES), were used to dissolve insoluble soybean fibers (ISF) extracted from okara and prepare regenerated CNCs (AUS/CNC and DES/ CNC), which were further modified by TEMPO oxidation (AUS/T-CNC and DES/T-CNC). The recoveries of AUS and DES were 82.58 % and 84.00 %, respectively. Chemical composition analysis showed high cellulose purity (>95 %) of the regenerated CNCs. FTIR, XRD and 13C NMR analysis indicated the cellulose structure and polymorph of CNCs. Thermal analysis revealed that the maximum degradation peak of regenerated CNC shifted to a lower temperature. AFM revealed that CNCs exhibited rod-like fiber structures, while AUS-pretreated CNCs exhibited some special spherical fibers. TEMPO oxidation showed an enhancement effect on the characteristics of AUS/T-CNC and DES/T-CNC; DES/T-CNC exhibited higher stability and apparent viscosity than AUS/T-CNC. The DES/T-CNC-based cryogel displayed a higher adsorption capacity for anthocyanin (0.40 g/g) and curcumin (1.09 g/g) with good controlled release capacity. These results indicated that green solvent pretreatment-assisted TEMPO oxidation is a new environmentally friendly and low-cost method for the preparation of CNCs and shows excellent potential in the field of drug loading and controlled release.

TI A review of hetero-structured Ni-based active catalysts for urea
   electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Urea electrooxidation has received considerable attention because of its tremendous practical application in environmental protection and energy regeneration. The catalytic performance of urea oxidation as an electrochemical reaction is highly determined by catalysts, and Ni-based catalysts have been intensively studied due to their low cost, facile structure tuning, and easy active phase formation based on the electrochemical-chemical mechanism. The Ni catalyst for urea oxidation can be largely improved by rational surface/interface structure optimization via various surface engineering approaches that provide more active sites, desirable crystal phase, and defects promoting the mass and electron transfer for the catalytic reaction. Due to significant recent advances, herein, we review the recent advances of heterostructured Ni-based active catalysts for urea electrolysis. The concerns about general heterostructured catalyst engineering principles in terms of crystal phase orientation, increased bond polarity, high-valent Ni formation, increased active surface area, electronic effect, and ensemble effect are first presented, and then theoretical analysis for the promotion effect is briefly demonstrated. Following this, specific hetero-structured Ni-based catalysts classified according to hetero-element doping, hetero-metallic alloying, and multi-component heterostructure construction are mainly discussed and analyzed with some typical examples. Finally, we present the problems, challenges, and perspective comments for the subject topic. It is noted that each component has its functionality to contribute to catalytic reactions, and the study on rationally integrated components to fully make use of their strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses is still a great challenge. Hopefully, this review could be helpful and instructive for the literature survey of heterostructured Ni-based catalysts in urea electrolysis.

TI Construction of MoSe 2 /Ni x Se y /NF Schottky heterojunction as
   electrocatalyst for water splitting and electrochemical oxidation for
   sulfur recovery
SO FUEL
AB Substituting oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with small molecule (urea, S2-) oxidation reaction being of favorable thermodynamical kinetics is a feasible strategy for energy-saving hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. Herein, we prepared anti-sulfuretted bifunctional MoSe 2 /Ni x Se y /NF Schottky heterojunction electrocatalysts on nickel foam by one-step hydrothermal method. The built-in electric field formed by this heterojunction promotes electron transfer and interfacial redox kinetics, making the catalyst being of excellent electrocatalytic performance. At 50 mA cm(-2) , the voltage of this catalyst for sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) in the sulfur-containing electrolyte is only 0.422 V vs. RHE, much lower than those of 1.399 and 1.557 V vs. RHE of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and OER, respectively. Moreover, the well-designed MoSe 2 /Ni x Se y /NF as a bifunctional catalyst for sulfur ion-assisted electrolysis in two-electrode electrolytic cells achieves a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a remarkably low voltage of only 0.47 V with little performance degradation for 200 h. The UV -vis spectra and XRD patterns show that S2- is gradually oxidized to short-chain polysulfide (S-x(2-), 2 <= x <= 4), and finally to form S 8 . This work provides a feasible strategy for energy-saving hydrogen production while treating sulfur-containing wastewater to protect the ecological environment and realize sulfur recovery.

TI [MoS4]<SUP>2-</SUP>-Intercalated NiCo-Layered Double
   Hydroxide Nanospikes: An Efficiently Synergized Material for Urine To
   Direct H2 Generation
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Substituting the energy-uphill water oxidation half-cell with readily oxidizable urea-rich urine, a ground-breaking bridge is constructed, combining the energy-efficient hydrogen generation and environmental 6 protection. Hence, designing a robust multifunctional electrocatalyst is desirable for widespread implementation of this waste to fuel technology. In this context, here, we report a simple tuning of the electrocatalytically favorable characteristics of NiCo-layered double hydroxide by introducing [MoS4]2- in its interlayer space. The [MoS4]' insertion as well as its effect on the electronic structure tuning is thoroughly studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with electrochemical analysis. This insertion induces overall electronic structure tuning of the hydroxide layer in such a way that the designed catalyst exhibited favorable kinetics toward all the required reactions of hydrogen generation. This is why our homemade catalyst, when utilized both as a cathode and anode to fabricate a urea electrolyzer, required a mere X1.37 V cell potential to generate sufficient H2 by reaching the benchmark 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH/0.33 M urea along with long-lasting catalytic efficiency. Other indispensable reason of selecting [MoS4]2- is its high-valent nature making the catalyst highly selective and insensitive to common catalyst-poisoning toxins of urine. This is experimentally supported by performing the real urine electrolysis, where the nanospike-covered Ni foam-based catalyst showed a performance similar to that of synthetic urea, offering its industrial value. Other intuition of selecting [MoS4]2- was to provide a ligand-based mechanism for hydrogen evolution half-cell [hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)] to preclude the HER-competing oxygen reduction. Another crucial point of our work is its potential to avoid the mixing of two explosive product gases, that is, H2 and O-2.

TI In vitro and in vivo metabolism of N-adamantyl
   substituted urea-based soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors
SO BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB N,N'-disubstituted urea-based soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors are promising therapeutics for hypertension, inflammation, and pain in multiple animal models. The drug absorption and pharmacological efficacy of these inhibitors have been reported extensively. However, the drug metabolism of these inhibitors is not well described. Here we reported the metabolic profile and associated biochemical studies of an N-adamantyl urea-based sEH inhibitor 1-adamantan-1-y1-3-(5-(2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy)pentyl)urea (AEPU) in vitro and in vivo. The metabolites of AEPU were identified by interpretation of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and/or NMR. In vitro, AEPU had three major positions for phase I metabolism including oxidations on the adamantyl moiety, urea nitrogen atoms, and cleavage of the polyethylene glycol chain. In a rodent model, the metabolites from the hydroxylation on the adamantyl group and nitrogen atom were existed in blood while the metabolites from cleavage of polyethylene glycol chain were not found in urine. The major metabolite found in rodent urine was 3-(3-adamantylureido)-propanoic acid, a presumably from cleavage and oxidation of the polyethylene glycol moiety. All the metabolites found were active but less potent than AEPU at inhibiting human sEH. Furthermore, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 was found to be a major enzyme mediating AEPU metabolism. In conclusion, the metabolism of AEPU resulted from oxidation by CYP could be shared with other N-adamantyl-urea-based compounds. These findings suggest possible therapeutic roles for AEPU and new strategies for drug design in this series of possible drugs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI In-Situ DRIFT Study of Au-Ir/Ceria Catalysts: Activity and Stability for
   CO Oxidation
SO TOPICS IN CATALYSIS
AB Monometallic gold and iridium, and bimetallic gold-iridium on ceria catalysts were synthesized by deposition-precipitation with urea. The activity of these ceria supported catalysts for CO oxidation was: Au-Ir >> Au > Ir. The bimetallic catalyst was highly active and stable during the carbon monoxide oxidation reaction, showing synergism between both metals. The catalysts were thoroughly characterized chemical and structurally. High-resolution electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed evidences of iridium-gold intimacy. In situ infrared spectroscopy in the diffuse reflectance mode was used to investigate the reactivity of the active sites. Concentration-modulation excitation spectroscopy allowed selective identification of intermediates and 'spectator' species. CO chemisorbed onto iridium sites (2096, 2060 and 2012 cm(-1)) was found inactive, whereas carbon monoxide on metallic gold sites (Au-0-CO, 2110 cm(-1)) exhibited reactivity for CO oxidation. In the bimetallic catalyst, new active sites (Au delta--CO, 2095 and 2026 cm(-1)) together with Au-0-CO species were observed, most likely produced by the isolation and stabilization of gold atoms by iridium.

TI Volatilization of Ammonia Originating from Urea Treated with Oxidized
   Charcoal
SO JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Loss of N through volatilization of ammonia is the main limitation for agricultural use of urea. The aim of this study was to evaluate the volatilization of NH3 from urea granulated (Ug) or urea coated (Ur) with two oxidized charcoals produced by the oxidation of eucalyptus charcoal with 4.0 mol L-1 HNO3, followed by the post-treatment with NaOH (CHox) or without post-treatment with NaOH (CHox-OH). Ug and Ur were produced with 5, 10, 15 and 20% (m/m) of CHox or CHox-OH. The volatilization of NH3 was evaluated as 100 mg of N in the form of Ug or Ur applied to samples of a Hapludalf placed in a system with continuous and controlled air flow. The Ug with CHox-OH or with CHox was more effective in reducing the volatilization of NH3 than the Ur. It was estimated that the Ug with 16% of CHox or CHox-OH, with 39% N, reduced the volatilization by 40% in relation to urea without the additives. Results show that charcoal oxidized is an effective additive for reducing ammonia volatilization of urea.

TI Ternary cobalt-iron-manganese layered double hydroxides with 1D/2D
   hierarchical nanostructure for oxygen evolution reaction and urea
   oxidation reaction
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Developing high-efficient and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for water splitting and metal-air batteries. Herein, ternary CoFe1-XMnX (0 < X < 1) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) grown on nickel form (NF) with nanosheet-nanowires (1D/2D) hierarchical nanostructure are synthesized. The introduction of Mn causes the change of crystal phase, morphology, and electronic structure of CoFe-LDH through electron transfer from Co/Fe to Mn, which provides the whole merit structural features and synergistic effect. Further experimental results exhibit that CoFe0.75Mn0.25-LDH possesses superior OER performance, which only requires overpotentials of 243 and 298 mV to reach 20 and 100 mA cm-2. The remodeling of LDHs in the OER process is also discussed to further explore the OER catalytic mechanism. In addition, CoFe0.75Mn0.25-LDH can also be utilized to the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which requests a low potential of 1.367 V to reach 10 mA cm-2. A solar driven water splitting system is assembled and acquires the current density of 10 mA cm-2 at the low cell voltage of 1.58 V. This work offers an effective approach to boost the OER and UOR performance of CoFe-LDH based bifunctional electrocatalysts.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI V8C7 decorating CoP nanosheets-assembled
   microspheres as trifunctional catalysts toward energy-saving
   electrolytic hydrogen production
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Hydrogen production via water electrolysis for large scale application is still limited majorly by the huge energy consumption and high cost of catalyst materials. In this work, with rationally designing V/Co metal-organic framework (V/Co-MOF) as a precursor, a series of V8C7 decorating CoP nanosheets-assembled microspheres (V8C7/CoP) was synthesized via pyrolysis and a subsequent phosphidation. Thanks to the synergistic effect between V8C7 and CoP, the optimized V8C7/CoP as trifunctional catalysts exhibit remarkable performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). More importantly, we propose an acid-alkaline asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer (AAAE) by using the optimized V8C7/CoP electrode as both acidic cathode for HER and alkaline anode UOR, respectively. The optimum AAAE system only needs an applied voltage of 0.8 V to reach an electrolytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen production, which significantly reduces the energy consumption for hydrogen production owing to the assistance of electrochemical neutralization energy (ENE) and electrochemical urea oxidation energy.

TI Carbon dioxide abatement by integration of methane bi-reforming process
   with ammonia and urea synthesis
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The use of thermal power plants has been increasing lately, despite its use being associated with high greenhouse gases emissions, especially carbon dioxide. In the context of the Paris Agreement of 2015, carbon dioxide capture, storage and utilization techniques must be increasingly employed to reduce environmental impacts. The utilization of carbon dioxide from a power plant flue gas as feedstock to other chemicals synthesis (such as ammonia and urea) arises as a good alternative to achieve near-zero carbon dioxide emissions. The aim of this work is to propose an alternative route, based on the bi-reforming of methane, for the synthesis gas section of ammonia and urea production plants, in order to promote carbon dioxide abatement, comparing this innovative route with the conventional and century-long existing process. Technical and environmental metrics of the proposed and conventional routes were compared. Aspen Plus (R) process simulator was used to simulate the bireforming process and both routes for ammonia and urea synthesis and choose the operational parameters. Simulation results show that for a target production of 2000 tonne/day of urea, the proposed alternative route has the potential to abate 745 tonne/day of carbon dioxide, while the conventional route emits 1156 tonne/day of carbon dioxide. Comparison of technical metrics of both routes shows that the proposed route requires an electricity usage of 0.27 MWh/tonne of products while the conventional route requires 0.47 MWh/tonne of products. However, hydrogen yield in the conventional route is higher than in its counterpart, with 0.41 and 0.22 tonnes of hydrogen produced for each tonne of inlet natural gas in the conventional and proposed routes, respectively. Comparison of economic metrics of both configurations show that none of the routes are economically viable, however, the alternative route has better economic indicators besides successfully promotes carbon dioxide abatement.

TI Plasma-Induced Surface Reconstruction of NiFe/Co3O4 Nanoarrays for
   High-Current and Ultrastable Oxygen Evolution and the Urea Oxidation
   Reaction
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Low-cost and simple strategies to synthesize highly efficient and robust oxidative electrocatalysts for commercial large-scale water electrolysis are still a challenge. Here, we reported a reductive H2 plasma surface modification strategy, where a defect-rich amorphous NiFe coating layer can be anchored and interact with porous Co3O4 nanoarrays. The plasma-modified surface can promote the reconstruction process to generate high-valence and ultra-active species, thus forming abundant active centers and oxygen vacancies with high electrocatalytic activity. The H2-NiFe/ Co3O4 composite reveals excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic ability, and ultralow overpotentials of 233 and 273 mV are required to reach 100 and 1000 mA cm-2, respectively, for oxygen evolution, while the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) requires the potentials of 1.315 and 1.420 V to reach 10 and 1000 mA cm-2, respectively. The superior electrocatalytic stability is confirmed by a 240 h long-term test at 1 A cm-2 for the oxygen evolution reaction and the consecutive multistep chronoamperometric tests for the UOR. This work provides an easily scalable and energy-efficient surface modification method to fabricate a robust bifunctional catalyst, while the atomic species and configuration can also be flexibly adjusted, which is suitable to be extended to various application fields.

TI 1D/2D core-shell structure Ni-Mo-S@NiFe LDH grown on nickel foam: a
   bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient oxygen evolution and urea
   oxidation reactions
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The construction of bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is important for accelerating the development of the hydrogen economy. Herein, a novel three-dimensional core-shell heterostructure (Ni-Mo-S@NiFeLDH/NF) was prepared by vertically growing NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheets on nickel foam (NF)-supported arrays of Ni-Mo-S (Ni3S2, Ni0.96S, Mo2S3) nanorods via a hydrothermal-sulfide-hydrothermal process. Benefiting from the unique core-shell structure with numerous exposed active sites, the optimized Ni-Mo-S@NiFe LDH/NF shows excellent OER/UOR activity, with an overpotential of only 274 mV for OER to reach 100 mA cm-2 and 1.318 V for UOR to reach 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, the assembled Ni-Mo-S@NiFe LDH||Pt/C urea electrolytic system requires only 1.348 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2, as much as 159 mV lower than pure water electrolysis. This work provides an idea for researching NiFe LDH-based OER/UOR bifunctional catalysts.
   Benefiting from the unique core-shell structure with numerous exposed active sites, the electrocatalyst Ni-Mo-S@NiFe LDH/NF exhibits excellent OER and UOR activities.

TI Modulating Electronic Structure by Etching Strategy to Construct
   NiSe2/Ni0.85Se Heterostructure for Urea-Assisted
   Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
SO SMALL
AB Exploring and developing novel strategies for constructing heterostructure electrocatalysts is still challenging for water electrolysis. Herein, a creative etching treatment strategy is adopted to construct NiSe2/Ni0.85Se heterostructure. The rich heterointerfaces between NiSe2 and Ni0.85Se emerge strong electronic interaction, which easily induces the electron transfer from NiSe2 to Ni0.85Se, and tunes the charge-state of NiSe2 and Ni0.85Se. In the NiSe2/Ni0.85Se heterojunction nanomaterial, the higher charge-state Ni0.85Se is capable of affording partial electrons to combine with hydrogen protons, inducing the rapid formation of H(2 )molecule. Accordingly, the lower charge-state NiSe2 in the NiSe2/Ni0.85Se heterojunction nanomaterial is more easily oxidized into high valence state Ni3+ during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, which is beneficial to accelerate the mass/charge transfer and enhance the electrocatalytic activities towards OER. Theoretical calculations indicate that the heterointerfaces are conducive to modulating the electronic structure and optimizing the adsorption energy toward intermediate H* during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, leading to superior electrocatalytic activities. To expand the application of the NiSe2/Ni0.85Se-2h electrocatalyst, urea is served as the adjuvant to proceed with the energy-saving hydrogen production and pollutant degradation, and it is proven to be a brilliant strategy.

TI Urease covalently immobilized on cotton-derived nanocellulose-dialdehyde
   for urea detection and urea-based multicomponent synthesis of
   tetrahydro-pyrazolopyridines in water
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The urease Schiff-base covalently bonded to the designed high-content nanocellulosedialdehyde (HANCD) prepared from cotton-derived nanocellulose (NC) via tandem acid-hydrolysis and periodate-oxidation reactions was termed HANCD@urease. No change in the aldehyde content of HANCD after Schiff-base bonding to urease and similarity in the relative enzyme activities for HANCD@urease and free enzyme supported that the preparation conditions for HANCD-loaded urease are mild enough to prevent denaturation of the enzyme. As the immobilized urease showed higher stability and reusability versus free enzyme, the HANCD@urease was efficiently used to determine the urea concentration in aqueous solutions and blood serum samples. Alternatively, the catalytic efficiency of the HANCD@urease was demonstrated for the production of ammonia from urea in the multicomponent synthesis of 3,5-dimethyl-4-aryl-1,4,7,8-tetrahydrodipyrazolo[3,4-b:4 ',3 '-e]pyridines (THPPs) in water. This new environment-friendly urea sensor showed 90% preservation of the enzyme activity after the six cycles of reuse in enzymatic reactions, while its catalytic activity in the reaction of benzaldehyde, hydrazine hydrate, and alkyl acetoacetate with urea instead of hygroscopic ammonium salts did not change significantly after the sixth run. Detection and production of ammonia by a bio-compatible sensor and catalyst under mild conditions are features of this new green protocol.

TI Microwave-pulse synthesis of tunable 2D porous nickel-enriched
   LaMnxNi1-xO3 solid
   solution for efficient electrocatalytic urea oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Amidst the pressing demand for carbon neutrality and clean energy policies, the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has gained attention as an efficient and environmentally friendly energy conversion pathway. High-valence/content two-dimensional (2D) nickel-based ABO(3) perovskite oxides, particularly LaNiO3, are highlighted for their elevated intrinsic catalytic activity and rich electronic configuration advantages. To enhance the intrinsically limited conductivity of LaNiO3, a modified strategy involving B-site substitution can be used to construct a solid solution structure, significantly improving the electronic configuration. However, as Ni is the primary active site for the UOR, substituting the B-site will create a trade-off between enhancing electron migration and decreasing active site content. Specifically, conventional synthesis methods with a slow-entropy-change pose challenges in precise control over atomic ratios and 2D structure design, hindering elucidation of the impact mechanism of the electronic configuration on UOR performance. Herein, we utilized the microwave-pulse method for rapid synthesis of highly tunable 2D porous nickel-enriched LaMnxNi1-xO3 perovskite. Leveraging transient high-temperature and high-energy conditions, we achieved rapid one-step equilibrium between 2D porous structure design and precise control of solid solution atomic ratios. This strategy allows for the controlled synthesis of 2D nickel-enriched solid solutions with excellent conductivity and UOR activity, while effectively avoiding the generation of by-products, providing a detailed analysis of the UOR activity mechanism dependent on distinct electronic configurations. The synthesized LaMn0.2Ni0.8O3 structure exhibits optimal UOR performance. This strategy provides a new avenue for the design of more unique structured nickel-based solid solutions and the investigation of their structure-performance relationships in the electrocatalytic UOR.

TI Imidazolate-mediated synthesis of hierarchical flower-like

SO MOLECULAR CATALYSIS
AB Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) materials with specific structure have shown great potential as highly efficient catalysts in the oxidation reactions. In this work, a novel hierarchical flower-like Co3O4 was synthesized by the imidazolateinduced hydrothermal and subsequent thermolysis method. The effect of reaction parameters as well as the phase evolution of the flower-like structure was investigated in detail. For comparison, a rod-like Co3O4 was also prepared with urea under similar conditions. The morphology-dependent effect of Co3O4 towards toluene oxidation was studied. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of Co3O4 were analyzed by various characterization techniques. The flower-like Co3O4 catalyst presented a higher catalytic activity for toluene oxidation than the rod-like Co3O4, which was associated with hierarchical flower-like morphology, reactive exposed planes, abundant adsorbed oxygen species at surface and better low-temperature reducibility.

TI Urea-based fuel cells on paper with micro-watt power generation to drive
   low power circuits
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB This work demonstrates the application of urea-powered paper-based fuel cells (PFCs) with Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidant to drive a flexible electronic circuit (ring oscillator (RO)), for the first time. Herein, the electrochemical performance of four different PFCs has been studied by employing non-precious electrodes as the anode and cathode. These are the membraneless PFC with (i) Toray carbon paper (CP) (ii) Nickel (Ni)-mesh (iii) Nickel Cobalt nanoparticles supported on reduced Graphene Oxide loaded on the CP (Ni Co@rGo@CP) and (iv) membrane-based PFC with Ni Co@rGo@CP as the electrodes. In each PFC the same electrode is employed on both the sides. A single membraneless-PFC with Ni-Co@rGo@CP as electrodes delivered a peak power density (Pmax) of 55 mu W cm-2, maximum current density (Jmax) of 371 mu A cm-2 and an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.7 V at 3 M urea. While, a single membrane-based PFC assembled on an anion exchange membrane with Ni-Co@rGo@CP electrodes, delivered a Pmax of approximate to 70 mu W cm-2 and Jmax of approximate to 500 mu A cm-2 at an OCV of 0.7 V with 3 M urea. Subsequently, a stack of two membrane-based PFCs delivered an OCV of approximate to 1.4 V for 400 s. Finally, this stack is employed as a power source to drive a RO. The measured frequency and peak-to-peak voltage are 37.52 kHz and 1.04 V, respectively. This demonstration opens a window to implement self-contained flexible electronic system using PFCs as the power source with minimal e-waste.

AB This paper attempts to utilize microarc oxidation (MAO) to fabricate the aluminum nitride/aluminum oxide composite ceramic coating on aluminum alloy surface. The effects of MAO voltages, different nitrogen sources, concentration on the surface morphology, and nitrogen content of the coatings are investigated. The results show that the highest nitrogen content (21.22 at%) is obtained on the surface of the coating by the energy dispersive spectrometer analysis under the condition of MAO voltage of 575 V, urea 22.50 g/L, and ammonium hydroxide 20 mL/L condition.

TI A Ni(OH)2-modified Ti-doped α-Fe2O3
   photoanode for improved photoelectrochemical oxidation of urea: the role
   of Ni(OH)2 as a cocatalyst
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB For semiconductor-based PEC systems, loading an appropriate cocatalyst on a semiconductor (such as a solar-active material) can significantly improve the PEC activity due to the suppression of photogenerated charge recombination. But there is little direct information about the role of a cocatalyst in the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers. In our work, a combination of surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), transient photovoltage (TPV) technique, photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) and transient photocurrent measurements was used to study the real role of Ni(OH)(2) as a cocatalyst for the enhanced PEC performance of Ni(OH)(2)-modified Ti-doped alpha-Fe2O3. It was found that Ni(OH)(2) as a hole storage layer enhances the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and increases the lifetime of holes, which contributed to the enhanced photocurrent. In addition, Ni(OH)(2) is a good cocatalyst for urea oxidation which suppresses the over-potential, resulting in a negative shift of the onset potential.

TI Heterostructured manganese catalysts for the selective oxidation of
   5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-diformylfuran
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB A series of manganese oxide catalysts were synthesised in the presence of various precipitants using hydrothermal approach. The manganese oxide synthesised (MnOx-A-U) using manganese acetate tetrahydrate and urea as precursor and precipitant, respectively, was found to be composed of heterostructures of manganese, that is, MnCO3, epsilon-MnO2 and Mn2O3, and their presence were confirmed by XRD, FTIR and XPS analyses. The catalytic activity of MnOx-A-U towards selective oxidation of HMF to DFF in ethanol afforded 92.0 % conversion along with 88.0 % DFF yield at 120 degrees C, 30 bar O-2, after 4 h of reaction time. Performing HMF oxidation under N-2 atmosphere with MnOx-A-U yielded only 15.0 % DFF, revealing that lattice oxygen played a crucial role in the oxidation process, which was confirmed by subjecting the spent catalyst to XPS analysis. Based on the results obtained from XPS analysis, it was speculated that epsilon-MnO2 and MnCO3 could be the active species which could selectively catalyse the reaction. The MnOx-A-U catalyst was able to recycle for at least three runs with a small loss of activity due to epsilon-MnO2 content decreased.

TI Novel I-V Disposable Urea Biosensor Based on a Dip-coated
   Hierarchical Magnetic Nanocomposite
   (Fe3O4@SiO2@NH2) on
   SnO2:F Layer
SO JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Silicon oxide was initially loaded on a Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticle substrate (Fe3O4@SiO2) and then functionalized with NH2 group (Fe3O4@SiO2@NH2) to construct a novel hierarchical magnetic nanocomposite. A sensitive urea biosensor medium involving a dip-coated hierarchical magnetic nanocomposite on F-doped SnO2 conducting glass was designed (Fe3O4@SiO2@NH2/SnO2:F) to achieve an excellent platform for urease (Urs) enzyme immobilization via covalent linking to the exposed NH2 groups through glutaraldehyde (Urs/Fe3O4@SiO2@NH2/SnO2:F). The hierarchical magnetic nanocomposite selection criteria were based on enhancement of urea biosensing by Urs immobilization via covalent linking to the exposed NH2 groups, while the SnO2:F selection as substrate was based on its ability to afford high electronic density to the biosensor surface as an electrostatic repulsion layer for the anionic interferents in the biological environment. FE-SEM, TEM, FTIR, CV, EIS, and I-V techniques established the morphology of the modified electrode's surface and electrochemical behavior of urea on the fabricated Urs/Fe3O4@SiO2@NH2/SnO2:F biosensor. The sensing mechanism can be clarified on the basis of the two reactions, namely (1) catalytic reaction and (2) oxidation or reduction of metal oxides, same as in the case of solid-state gas sensors. The I-V results display high sensitivity for urea detection of within 5-210 mg/dL and a limit of detection of 3 mg/dL.

TI Testosterone prevents protein loss via the hepatic urea cycle in human
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Context: The urea cycle is a rate-limiting step for amino acid nitrogen elimination. The rate of urea synthesis is a true indicator of whole-body protein catabolism. Testosterone reduces protein and nitrogen loss. The effect of testosterone on hepatic urea synthesis in humans has not been studied. Objective: To determine whether testosterone reduces hepatic urea production.
   Design: An open-label study.
   Patients and intervention: Eight hypogonadal men were studied at baseline, and after two weeks of transdermal testosterone replacement (Testogel, 100 mg/day).
   Main outcomes measures: The rate of hepatic urea synthesis was measured by the urea turnover technique using stable isotope methodology, with N-15(2)-urea as tracer. Whole-body leucine turnover was measured, from which leucine rate of appearance (LRa), an index of protein breakdown and leucine oxidation (Lox), a measure of irreversible protein loss, were calculated.
   Results: Testosterone administration significantly reduced the rate of hepatic urea production (from 544.4 +/- 71.8 to 431.7 +/- 68.3 mu mol/min; rho < 0.01), which was paralleled by a significant reduction in serum urea concentration. Testosterone treatment significantly reduced net protein loss, as measured by percent Lox/LRa, by 19.3 +/- 5.8% ( rho < 0.05). There was a positive association between Lox and hepatic urea production at baseline (r(2) = 0.60, rho < 0.05) and after testosterone administration (r(2) = 0.59, rho < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Testosterone replacement reduces protein loss and hepatic urea synthesis. We conclude that testosterone regulates whole-body protein metabolism by suppressing the urea cycle.

TI Producing more grain yield of rice with less ammonia volatilization and
   greenhouse gases emission using slow/controlled-release urea
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Ammonia (NH3) volatilization and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields contaminate the atmospheric environment and lead to global warming. Field trials (2013-2015) were conducted to estimate the influences of different types of fertilization practices on grain yield, NH3 volatilization, and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a double rice cropping system in Central China. Results showed that grain yields of rice were improved significantly by using slow/controlled-release urea (S/C-RU). Compared with farmers' fertilizer practice (FFP) treatment, average annual grain yield with application of polymer-coated urea (CRU), nitrapyrin-treated urea (CP), and urea with effective microorganism (EM) treatments was increased by 18.0%, 16.2%, and 15.4%, respectively. However, the effects on NH3 volatilization and CH4 and N2O emissions differed in diverse S/C-RU. Compared with that of the FFP treatment, the annual NH3 volatilization, CH4 emission, and N2O emissions of the CRU treatment were decreased by 64.8%, 19.7%, and 35.2%, respectively; the annual CH4 and N2O emissions of the CP treatment were reduced by 33.7% and 40.3%, respectively, while the NH3 volatilization was increased by 18.5%; the annual NH3 and N2O emissions of the EM treatment were reduced by 6.3% and 28.7%, while the CH4 emission was improved by 4.3%. Overall, CP showed the best emission reduction with a decrement of 34.3% in global warming potential (GWP) and 44.4% in the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), followed by CRU treatment with a decrement of 21.1% in GWP and 31.7% in GHGI, compared with that of the FFP treatment. Hence, it is suggested that polymer-coated urea can be a feasible way of mitigating NH3 volatilization and CH4 and N2O emission from rice fields while maintaining or increasing the grain yield in Chinese, the double rice cropping system.

TI Self-supported bimetallic Ni-Co compound electrodes for urea- and
   neutralization energy-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production
SO NANOSCALE
AB Hydrogen represents one of the most promising renewable energy sources for next generation energy systems, however, its large scale production is high cost and high energy. A proof-of-concept alkaline-acid electrolyzer is reported here that can significantly reduce the amount of electrical energy consumed in electrolytic hydrogen production, implemented by the development of self-supported bimetallic Ni-Co compound electrodes used as the anode and cathode, respectively, where a urea oxidation reaction (UOR) occurs at the alkaline Ni0.67Co0.33(OH)(2) nanosheet anode, coupled to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the acidic Ni0.67Co0.33S2 cathode. The asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer can efficiently harvest two kinds of energies, i.e. electrochemical neutralization energy (ENE) and electrochemical urea oxidation energy, to assist electrolytic hydrogen production using waste urea, acid, and base. The as-designed electrolyzer can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for electrolytic H-2 generation with a rather low applied voltage of 0.54 V, with the potential to use up waste urea, acid and base.

TI Surface decorated magnetic nanoparticles with Mn-porphyrin as an
   effective catalyst for oxidation of sulfides
SO JOURNAL OF PORPHYRINS AND PHTHALOCYANINES
AB Mn-porphyrin complex was anchored coordinatively to silica-coated surface of magnetic nanoparticles (SMNP). Afterward, a heterogeneous nanocatalyst (Fe3O4@SiO2-MnTCPP) has been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). A thermal stability up to around 350 degrees C was verified for prepared nanocatalyst based on thermogravimetric analysis. Finally, the catalytic performance of magnetically recoverable Mn-catalyst was exploited in the green oxidation of different sulfides with urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in the presence of imidazole as co-catalyst in ethanol under heterogeneous conditions. The eco-friendly property of ethanol strongly induced us to employ it as the reaction solvent in this oxidation system. Complete conversion (>= 99) of sulfides to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfones was obtained for ethyl phenyl sulfide, phenyl vinyl sulfide, diallyl sulfide, thiocyanatoethane, 2-ethyl mercaptoethanol and tetrahydrothiophene. Moreover, the recovered catalysts keep constant conversion yield up to at least three cycles.

TI Ultrafast room-temperature activation of nickel foams as highly
   efficient electrocatalysts
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Nickel foams (NF) are widely used electrode substrates that are associated with a wide range of industrial chains and large economic benefits. However, the pristine Ni foams usually possess poor electrochemical activities with dense passivation layers. Herein, an ultra-fast method for activating raw Ni foam was developed by soaking the Ni foam in a formulation solution of thiourea and I2/KI at room temperature for just a few minutes. In the solution, I-3- (I-2 + I-) acts as an oxidizer to accelerate the formation of Ni2+, while the hydrolysis of thiourea provides a weakly acidic environment and sulfur ions for formation of superficial layer NiS with I doping. The activated Ni foam has a fluffy nanosheet structure and the activity, characterized by the integrated Ni2+/Ni3+ peak area is enhanced by more than 100 times. The activated electrode exhibits high performance towards urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in alkaline electrolytes, delivering a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at only 1.44 V (vs. RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode). The in situ Raman spectroscopy identifies NiOOH as the catalytically active species for urea oxidation and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) isotope tracking experiment reveals an intramolecular N-N bond coupling mechanism during the UOR. The developed activation method is easy to scale up for preparing large-area electrode and the catalytic activity is extended to oxidation of other organic molecules. This work presents a novel ultrafast one-step surface engineering strategy for activating Ni foams into high-performance electrocatalysts.

TI Influence of lactation stage on heat production and macronutrient
   oxidation in dairy cows during a 24-hour fasting period
SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
AB Understanding nutrient utilization and partitioning is essential for advancing the efficiency of dairy cattle. Our objective was to determine if dairy cows exposed to a 24-h fasting period differ in heat production (HP) and macronutrient oxidation at different stages of lac-tation. Twelve primiparous, lactating German Holstein dairy cows were used in a longitudinal study design spanning from 2013 to 2014. Dairy cows were housed in respiration chambers during 3 stages of the lactation cycle: early (mean +/- SD; 28.8 +/- 6.42 d), mid-(89.4 +/- 4.52 d), and late (293 +/- 7.76 d) lactation. Individual CO2, O2, and CH4 gas exchanges were measured every 6 min for two 24-h periods, an ad libitum period and fast-ing period (RES). Blood was sampled at the start and end of the RES period. Gas measurements were used to calculate HP, net carbohydrate oxidation (COX), and net fat oxidation (FOX). Measurements were corrected with metabolic BW (kg of BW0.75; cBW). The RES pe-riod for each stage of lactation was further subdivided into the start (RESstart) and end (RESend) by averaging the first and last 2 h of the RES period. The net change was calculated as RESend - RESstart. All energy vari-ables differed among lactation stage within the RES period except for HP/cBW. As expected, COX, COX/ cBW, COX/HP, HP, and HP/cBW, were greater at the RESstart compared with RESend, whereas FOX, FOX/ cBW, and FOX/HP were greater at the RESend except for FOX and FOX/cBW during mid lactation, which was only a tendency for a difference. The net change for COX, COX/cBW, HP, HP/cBW, and FOX/cBW did not differ among stages of lactation. Despite detecting a tendency for a difference among stage of lactation for FOX, pairwise analysis revealed no differences. Plasma triglyceride, urea, and nonesterified fatty acid concen-trations were greater at RESend than RESstart. The net change for plasma glucose, urea, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were greater in early than late lactation. Our results demonstrate that despite differences in absolute measurements of energy variables and plasma metabolites, the change in whole-body macronutrient oxidation and HP as cows' transition from a fed-like state to a starvation-like state during a 24-h fasting period is consistent throughout lactation.

SO JOURNAL OF POROUS MATERIALS
AB Functionalized Copper(II) complex into nano dimensional mesoreactor was successfully prepared. The Copper(II) complex with N-O donor Schiff base ligand was readily trapped into mesoporous silica MCM-41 through the post grafting method. N-O Chelating Schiff-base-MCM-41 has been derived from 5-bromo-salicylaldehyde and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane which was functionalized on MCM-41 via silicon alkoxide route. This compound was characterized by FT-IR, TGA, small angle X-ray diffraction patterns, ICP/MS analysis and N-2 sorption-desorption analysis. The catalytic property of Cu-salen-MCM-41 was considered for the preparation of disulfides using urea hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. The reaction progress is simple and proceeds under mild and heterogeneous conditions in acetonitrile at the ambient of temperature. The corresponding disulfides have been achieved with high purity and good to excellent yields; also, no over oxidation to sulfoxide or sulfone was observed in all cases. The catalyst can be recovered and reused several times without significant loss of stability and activity.

The familiar organics can be oxidized to more useful intermediates in chemical industries. Herein, a SnO2/ (CoTeO3)2 heterojunction is designed as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and organic electrocatalytic oxidation. The heterojunction has good electrocatalytic performances with overpotentials of 281 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH+0.1 M glycerol, 358 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH +0.33 M urea, 203 mV in 1 M KOH+0.1 M glucose, and 111 mV for HER in 1 M KOH. The glucose is electrocatalytically oxidized to gluconic acid and formic acid. Density functional theory computation shows the formation of the SnO2/(CoTeO3)2 heterojunction makes the total densities of states of SnO2 move to the Fermi level, which is beneficial for adsorption in the electrocatalysis. This work propagandizes a new avenue for heterojunction electrocatalyst is applied for organics oxidation linking to hydrogen production.

Urea cycle disorders (UCD) and certain organic acidurias are the major groups of inherited rare diseases manifested with hyperammonemia (HA) with UC dysregulation. Importantly, several commonly prescribed drugs, including antiepileptics in monotherapy or polytherapy from carbamazepine to valproic acid or specific antineoplastic agents such as asparaginase or 5-fluorouracil may be associated with HA by mechanisms not fully elucidated. HA, disclosing an imbalance between ammoniagenesis and ammonia disposal via the UC, can evolve to encephalopathy which may lead to significant morbidity and central nervous system damage. This review will focus on biochemical mechanisms related with HA emphasizing some poorly understood perspectives behind the disruption of the UC and mitochondrial energy metabolism, namely: i) changes in acetyl-CoA or NAD(+) levels in subcellular compartments; ii) post-translational modifications of key UC-related enzymes, namely acetylation, potentially affecting their catalytic activity; iii) the mitochondrial sirtuins-mediated role in ureagenesis. Moreover, the main UCD associated with HA will be summarized to highlight the relevance of investigating possible genetic mutations to account for unexpected HA during certain pharmacological therapies. The ammonia-induced effects should be avoided or overcome as part of safer therapeutic strategies to protect patients under treatment with drugs that may be potentially associated with HA.

TI Electrocatalytic Activity of Heteroatom-Doped Graphene for Oxidation of
   Hydroquinones
SO ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB In the present study, we aim to synthesize heteroatom (nitrogen or boron) doped-reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO or B-rGO) as a catalyst for the electro-oxidation of hydroquinones, used as a candidate of fuel (hydrogen carrier molecule) for direct-type fuel cells (DFC5), and evaluate the doping effect on its catalytic activity. N-rGO and B-rGO were prepared from a mixture of graphene oxide (GO) and urea or boron trioxide by pyrolysis method. We characterized the morphology and crystal structure of the prepared materials by transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show the loading amount of the heteroatoms, 10.4wt% N and 2.9 wt% B, as well as their chemical nature. The electrochemical analysis of the prepared materials by rotating disk electrode system reveals high activity of B-rGO, 15 and 85 mV lower overvoltage compared with rGO at the half-wave potential of diffusion-limited current, for the electro-oxidation of hydroquinone and methyl-hydroquinone, respectively, because of its electron-accepting nature. We demonstrate that thus modified carbons exhibit high activity, B-rGO > N-rGO > rGO, for the oxidation of hydroquinone derivatives as non-metallic anodes of DFC5. (C) The Author(s) 2020.

TI A Highly Crystalline Perylene Imide Polymer with the Robust Built-In
   Electric Field for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Oxidation
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB A highly crystalline perylene imide polymer (Urea-PDI) photocatalyst is successfully constructed. The Urea-PDI presents a wide spectrum response owing to its large conjugated system. The Urea-PDI performs so far highest oxygen evolution rate (3223.9 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)) without cocatalysts under visible light. The performance is over 107.5 times higher than that of the conventional PDI supramolecular photocatalysts. The strong oxidizing ability comes from the deep valence band (+1.52 eV) which is contributed by the covalent-bonded conjugated molecules. Besides, the high crystallinity and the large molecular dipoles of the Urea-PDI contribute to a robust built-in electric field promoting the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the Urea-PDI is very stable and has no performance attenuation after 100 h continuous irradiation. The Urea-PDI polymer photocatalyst provides with a new platform for the use of photocatalytic water oxidation, which is expected to contribute to clean energy production.

TI Bimetallic Cu/Fe MOF-Based Nanosheet Film via Binder-Free Drop-Casting
   Route: A Highly Efficient Urea-Electrolysis Catalyst
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Developing efficient electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can be a promising alternative strategy to substitute the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thereby producing hydrogen at a lower cell-voltage. Herein, we synthesized a binder-free thin film of ultrathin sheets of bimetallic Cu-Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (Cu/Fe-MOFs) on a nickel foam via a drop-casting route. In addition to the scalable route, the drop-casted film-electrode demonstrates the lower UOR potentials of 1.59, 1.58, 1.54, 1.51, 1.43 and 1.37 V vs. RHE to achieve the current densities of 2500, 2000, 1000, 500, 100 and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. These UOR potentials are relatively lower than that acquired by the pristine Fe-MOF-based film-electrode synthesized via a similar route. For example, at 1.59 V vs. RHE, the Cu/Fe-MOF electrode exhibits a remarkably ultra-high anodic current density of 2500 mA cm(-2), while the pristine Fe-MOF electrode exhibits only 949.10 mA cm(-2). It is worth noting that the Cu/Fe-MOF electrode at this potential exhibits an OER current density of only 725 mA cm(-2), which is far inconsequential as compared to the UOR current densities, implying the profound impact of the bimetallic cores of the MOFs on catalyzing UOR. In addition, the Cu/Fe-MOF electrode also exhibits a long-term electrochemical robustness during UOR.

TI NiFe LDH/MoS2/Ni3S2 p-n/Mott-Schottky heterojunction for efficient
   hydrogen generation coupled with electrochemical oxidation of organic
   molecules
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Urea and organic molecules assisted electrochemical water splitting is a promising strategy to realize energy saving hydrogen production and simultaneous treatment of wastewater containing urea and organic pollutants. It is an effective approach to develop advanced electrocatalysts being of excellent catalytic performance by constructing a metal-semiconductor or semiconductor-semiconductor heterogeneous interface to regulate the electronic structure, thus forming the highly catalytic sites. Herein, we prepared a NiFe LDH/MoS2/Ni3S2 ternary heterojunction as a bifunctional catalyst on nickel foam (NiFe LDH/MoS2/Ni3S2/NF) via constructing Schottky interface and p-n heterojunction interface. In view of the built-in electric field between the heterogeneous interfaces, the electron transfer in interfaces is accelerated, and the adsorption of OH- and the dissociation of urea are also promoted, which results in excellent electrocatalytic performance including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (ETOR). At 50 mA cm-2, the voltages of HER, OER, UOR and ETOR are-0.100, 1.511, 1.410, 1.427 V vs. RHE, respectively, better than the most of reported electrocatalysts. In two-electrode electrolytic cells using NiFe LDH/ MoS2/Ni3S2/NF as cathode and anode catalysts, this material also exhibits the outstanding catalytic performance in electrolytes of 1.0 M KOH, 1.0 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea and 1.0 M KOH containing 0.5 M lactic acid. This research provides a feasible approach for constructing advanced electrocatalysts by combining the different metal-based compounds to form the heterojunction with highly catalytic sites, thus realizing the aim of acquiring hydrogen energy and simultaneous treatment of urea wastewater and other organic pollutants.

TI Manganese-Hydroxido Complexes Supported by a Urea/Phosphinic Amide
   Tripodal Ligand
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) within the secondary coordination sphere are often invoked as essential noncovalent interactions that lead to productive chemistry in metalloproteins. Incorporating these types of effects within synthetic systems has proven a challenge in molecular design that often requires the use of rigid organic scaffolds to support H-bond donors or acceptors. We describe the preparation and characterization of a new hybrid tripodal ligand ([H(2)pout](3-)) that contains two monodeprotonated urea groups and one phosphinic amide. The urea groups serve as H-bond donors, while the phosphinic amide group serves as a single H-bond acceptor. The [H(2)pout](3-) ligand was utilized to stabilize a series of Mn-hydroxido complexes in which the oxidation state of the metal center ranges from 2+ to 4+. The molecular structure of the Mn-III-OH complex demonstrates that three intramolecular H-bonds involving the hydroxido ligand are formed. Additional evidence for the formation of intramolecular H-bonds was provided by vibrational spectroscopy in which the energy of the O-H vibration supports its assignment as an H-bond donor. The stepwise oxidation of [Mn(II)H(2)pout(OH)](2-) to its higher oxidized analogs was further substantiated by electrochemical measurements and results from electronic absorbance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Our findings illustrate the utility of controlling both the primary and secondary coordination spheres to achieve structurally similar Mn-OH complexes with varying oxidation states.

TI Enhancement of toluene oxidation performance over Cu-Mn composite oxides
   by regulating oxygen vacancy
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Oxygen vacancy plays an important role in regulating the chemical and catalytic properties of catalysts. In this paper, Cu-Mn composite oxide catalyst was firstly synthesized by hydrothermal method and then modified by urea solid reaction treatment to obtain CM-X catalysts (X = 2, 4, 6, where x represents the weight ratio of urea/ CM catalyst) with different oxygen vacancy concentrations. The relationship between the structure and catalytic performance of these catalysts was analyzed by a variety of characterization techniques. The CM-4 sample showed the maximum specific surface area, which enhanced the adsorption capacity of the catalyst to the reactants. Moreover, there existed a large number of oxygen vacancies in CM-4 samples, leading to the amount increase of adsorbed oxygen species on the surface and high migration ability of lattice oxygen, which can improve the catalyst reducibility and oxygen species activity. Therefore, the CM-4 catalyst showed the excellent catalytic activity and stability for toluene oxidation, and toluene could be completely oxidized into CO2 and H2O at 215 degrees C under the equivalent gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 22,500 mLg(-1)h (1). And it was found by in situ DRIFTS experiment that the oxidation of toluene occurs via the benzyl alcohol-benzoate-anhydride reaction pathway on CM-4 catalyst.

TI CdS@Au micro-spheres as an active and durable bifunctional catalyst for
   the urea-assisted H2 evolution reaction
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) limit the efficiency of overall water splitting and urea oxidation for hydrogen generation, respectively. In this paper, we synthesize CdS@Au catalysts with excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER and UOR by a simple condensate reflux method. Using urea oxidation as an alternative anode reaction, the anodic oxidation potential decreased significantly to 286.4 mV@10 mA cm-2. With CdS@Au as the anode, the cell voltage drops to 1.34 V@10 mA cm-2. By discussing the Au content, it was shown that Au has a strong Lewis acidity and electronegativity, favoring hydrogen evolution.

TI Deposition of Potassium Salts on Soot Oxidation Activity of Cu-SSZ-13 as
   a SCRF Catalyst: Laboratory Study
SO CATALYSIS SURVEYS FROM ASIA
AB Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst, as the most popular selective catalytic reduction on filter (SCRF) catalyst in diesel exhaust purification, may suffer from severe alkali deposition derived from engine oil, urea solution and biodiesel fuel. These accumulated deposits inevitably affect both of the NOx reduction and soot oxidation reactions. Unlike deactivation effect of alkali impurities on Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst for NH3-SCR process, which has been extensively studied and well documented, the impact of alkali deposition on soot oxidation over SCRF catalyst is still poorly understood. Herein, we reported the influence of potassium salts deposition on soot oxidation of Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst. Compared with the fresh Cu-SSZ-13, these K-impregnated catalysts show promoted activities toward soot oxidation with the promotion effect of K2SO4 > K2CO3 > K3PO4. The generated copper compounds instead of potassium salts are found to be responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity. The NO oxidation over the K2CO3-impregnated catalyst is accelerated by CuOx clusters, resulting in a low ignition temperature toward soot oxidation in the presence of NOx. Contrarily, K2SO4- and K3PO4-impregnated catalysts show higher ignition temperature values because the generated copper sulfates and phosphates present weakened NO oxidation activities especially in the low-temperature region. This work provides new insight into understanding the affecting mechanism of alkali impurities on SCRF catalysts. Graphic The generated Cu species induced by the deposition of different potassium salts, rather than alkali species themselves, are responsible for the promoted soot oxidation activity of the K-impregnated Cu-SSZ-13 as a SCRF catalyst.

TI Phosphorus mineralization affected by urea in an intensively managed
   agricultural soil
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
AB A mineralizable P fractionin soils has not been considered in the current agronomic soil P test. Organic P might be a potential source of bioavailable P under the influence of specific soil conditions such as N input. In this laboratory incubation study, the effects of urea (0.1-0.3 g N kg(-1) soil) on P mineralization was investigated in an intensively managed agricultural soil using chemical extractions, phosphatase activity analysis, and solution P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). All urea application rates stimulated P release and P mineralization after 5 d, and bioavailable P increased for up to 40 d. The result of NMR analysis and phosphatase activity supported a shift from organic P to orthophosphate. Urea applications generally increased labile P from similar to 5 to similar to 24 mu g g(-1). However, acidity generated from the oxidation of NH4+ under the highest urea treatment (0.3 g of N kg(-1) soil) suppressed P mineralization, indicating the degree of urea application rate is sensitive to P mineralization. The results suggested the use of urea could enhance P bioavailability in P-rich agricultural soils. Tapping into reusable organic P resources in soils might be one of the practical and conservative approaches in the current agriculture.

TI n-Octanol oxidation on Au/TiO2 catalysts promoted with
   La and Ce oxides
SO MOLECULAR CATALYSIS
AB This study aims to improve gold-based catalyst effectiveness in n-octanol oxidation by adjusting the structural and electronic properties of gold through incorporation of additives to support. Au/La/TiO2, Au/Ce/TiO2, and Au/TiO2 catalysts, prepared by deposition-precipitation with urea, were tested in the base-free oxidation of octanol under mild conditions in liquid phase. The influence of additives on structural properties of the catalyst and the active phase, and on the electronic and redox properties of the active gold species was studied by TEM, SR-XRD, EXAFS, FTIR of adsorbed CO, and XPS. Support modifiers affected gold particle size distribution, but no direct dependence of the catalyst activity on Au NPs average size was observed. The activity of as-prepared catalysts was limited, and even lower in the presence of modifiers at that stage. Reductive pretreatment boosted the activity of every catalyst, and support modification with La and Ce increased four- and two-fold, respectively, the activity of Au/TiO2 under the same reaction conditions. The nature of modifiers also affected the product distribution where the outstanding performance of Au/La/TiO2 gives rise to the highest ester selectivity at isoconversion with no acid formation. Overall, the studied catalysts, and especially Au/Ce/TiO2, and Au/La/TiO2, hold promise for n-octanol oxidation under mild conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Novel Urea-Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles as a Heterogeneous

SO POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDS
AB A novel urea-functionalized silica-coated magnetic nanoparticle namely Fe3O4@SiO2@UBL was described as a reusable and recoverable heterogeneous hydrogen bonding catalyst. For characterization of the catalyst, varied techniques including Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, elemental mapping analysis, thermo gravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTG), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) were applied. Then, its catalytic performance was screened for the synthesis of new 2-hydroxy pyridine derivatives bearing sulfonate or sulfonamide moiety. Also, in a plausible mechanistic route, the stereoelectronic role of a cooperative vinylogous anomeric-based oxidation is suggested for the aromatization of targeted molecules.

TI Ammonia Oxidation by the Arctic Terrestrial Thaumarchaeote
   Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus arcticus Is Stimulated by Increasing
   Temperatures
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Climate change is causing arctic regions to warm disproportionally faster than those at lower latitudes, leading to alterations in carbon and nitrogen cycling, and potentially higher greenhouse gas emissions. It is thus increasingly important to better characterize the microorganisms driving arctic biogeochemical processes and their potential responses to changing conditions. Here, we describe a novel thaumarchaeon enriched from an arctic soil, Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus arcticus strain Kfb, which has been maintained for seven years in stable laboratory enrichment cultures as an aerobic ammonia oxidizer, with ammonium or urea as substrates. Genomic analyses show that this organism harbors all genes involved in ammonia oxidation and in carbon fixation via the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, characteristic of all AOA, as well as the capability for urea utilization and potentially also for heterotrophic metabolism, similar to other AOA. Ca. N. arcticus oxidizes ammonia optimally between 20 and 28 degrees C, well above average temperatures in its native high arctic environment (-3-4 degrees C). Ammonia oxidation rates were nevertheless much lower than those of most cultivated mesophilic AOA (20-45 degrees C). Intriguingly, we repeatedly observed apparent faster growth rates (based on marker gene counts) at lower temperatures (4-8 degrees C) but without detectable nitrite production. Together with potential metabolisms predicted from its genome content, these observations indicate that Ca. N. arcticus is not a strict chemolithotrophic ammonia oxidizer and add to cumulating evidence for a greater metabolic and physiological versatility of AOA. The physiology of Ca. N. arcticus suggests that increasing temperatures might drastically affect nitrification in arctic soils by stimulating archaeal ammonia oxidation.

TI Selective Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation to Produce
   H2O2 Using a C,N Codoped TiO2 Electrode
   in an Acidic Electrolyte
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via in situ electrochemical water oxidation possesses great potential applications in the energy and environment fields. In this work, for the first time, we reported a C,N codoped TiO2 electrode for selective electrocatalytic water oxidation to produce H(2)O(2)( )in an acidic electrolyte. An electrochemical anodic oxidation method combined with postcalcination in the presence of urea was applied to fabricate such a C,N codoped TiO2 electrode, which was evidenced by detail structural characterizations. The calcination temperature and urea atmosphere were found to play key roles in its catalytic performances; the optimized 600N sample exhibited an onset potential of 2.66 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1) at pH 3. Under the optimal applied potential, the cumulative H2O2 concentration for this sample reached 0.29 mu mol L-1 cm(-2) h(-1). More importantly, a simple recalcination strategy was developed to recover the deactivation electrode. This study proposed an efficient C,N codoped TiO2 electrode toward water oxidation to selectively produce H2O2 in the acidic electrolyte, which could be further used to in situ generate H2O2 for the energy- and environment-related fields with water as the precursor.

TI Hyperammonemia in Inherited Metabolic Diseases
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB Ammonia is a neurotoxic compound which is detoxified through liver enzymes from urea cycle. Several inherited or acquired conditions can elevate ammonia concentrations in blood, causing severe damage to the central nervous system due to the toxic effects exerted by ammonia on the astrocytes. Therefore, hyperammonemic patients present potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric symptoms, whose severity is related with the hyperammonemia magnitude and duration, as well as the brain maturation stage. Inherited metabolic diseases caused by enzymatic defects that compromise directly or indirectly the urea cycle activity are the main cause of hyperammonemia in the neonatal period. These diseases are mainly represented by the congenital defects of urea cycle, classical organic acidurias, and the defects of mitochondrial fatty acids oxidation, with hyperammonemia being more severe and frequent in the first two groups mentioned. An effective and rapid treatment of hyperammonemia is crucial to prevent irreversible neurological damage and it depends on the understanding of the pathophysiology of the diseases, as well as of the available therapeutic approaches. In this review, the mechanisms underlying the hyperammonemia and neurological dysfunction in urea cycle disorders, organic acidurias, and fatty acids oxidation defects, as well as the therapeutic strategies for the ammonia control will be discussed.

TI Highly efficient urea-anodizing to promote the electrochemical nitrogen
   reduction process
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Herein, we have developed a functionally integrated strategy that replaces water with much readily oxidized urea to promote the electrochemical N-2 fixation. A durable robust electrocatalyst, a MOF-driven C, N-codoped nanoarray grown on nickel foam, namely CuO/Cu2O@CD-CN/NiF, serves as both the cathode and anode for the N-2 reduction and urea oxidation. It is significant that an NH3 yield rate of 102.2 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) and a faradaic efficiency of 23.9% were obtained, significantly exceeding those of its urea-free counterpart. This research not only provides value to the future artificial nitrogen fixation to ammonia but also opens up new avenues for the replacement of the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for energy-efficient NH3 generation.

TI Enhancement of Ti3C2 MXene Pseudocapacitance after
   Urea Intercalation Studied by Soft X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB MXenes have shown outstanding properties due to their highly active hydrophilic surfaces coupled with high metallic conductivity. Many applications rely on the intercalation between Ti3C2Tx (T-x describes the -OH, -F and -O- surface terminations) flakes by ions or molecules, which in turn might alter the Ti3C2Tx surface chemistry and electro-chemical properties. In this work, we show that the capacitance, rate capability, and charge carrier kinetics in Ti3C2Tx MXene electrodes are remarkably enhanced after urea intercalation (u-Ti3C2Tx). In particular, remarkably enhanced after urea intercalation (u-Ti3C2Tx). In particular, the areal capacitance increased to 1100 mF/cm(2), which is 56% higher than that of pristine Ti3C2Tx electrodes. We attribute this dramatic improvement to changes in the Ti3C2Tx surface chemistry upon urea intercalation. The oxidation state and the oxygen bonding of individual Ti3C2Tx flakes before and after urea intercalation are probed by soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ti L- and O K-edges with 30 nm spatial resolution in vacuum. After urea intercalation, a higher Ti oxidation state is observed across the entire flake compared to pristine Ti3C2Tx. Additionally, in situ XAS of u-Ti3C2Tx aqueous dispersions reveal a higher Ti oxidation similar to dry samples, while for pristine Ti3C2Tx the Ti atoms are significantly reduced in water compared to dry samples.

TI Selective oxidation of pharmaceuticals and suppression of perchlorate
   formation during electrolysis of fresh human urine
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Urine comprises only a small (similar to 1%) volumetric fraction of municipal wastewater, but represents a dominant source of pharmaceuticals, many of which may pass through conventional wastewater treatment and pose risks to aquatic ecosystems. Point-source treatment of source-separated urine presents a unique opportunity to degrade pharmaceuticals before dilution with wastewater, and electrochemical advanced oxidation processes are one increasingly investigated option. However, they often lead to the formation of oxidation byproducts including chlorate, perchlorate at very high concentrations. Here, we show that the high urea content of fresh human urine suppresses the formation of oxychlorides by inhibiting formation of HOCl/OCl- during electrolysis, while still enabling pharmaceutical degradation due to the slow rate of urea oxidation by (OH)-O-center dot. This results in improved performance compared to equivalent treatment of hydrolyzed aged urine. This electrochemical oxidation scheme is shown to degrade the model contaminants cyclophosphamide and sulfamethoxazole with surface-area-to-volume-normalized pseudo-first-order rate constants greater than 0.08 cm/min in authentic fresh human urine. It results in similar to 100 x decrease in pharmaceutical concentrations in 2 h while generating similar to 1000 x lower oxychloride byproduct concentrations in synthetic fresh urine than synthetic hydrolyzed aged urine matrixes. Importantly, this proof-of-principle shows that simple and safe electrochemical methods can be used for point-source-remediation of pharmaceuticals in fresh human urine (before storage and hydrolysis), without formation of significant oxychloride byproducts.

TI Application of Controlled-Release Urea Enhances Grain Yield and Nitrogen
   Use Efficiency in Irrigated Rice in the Yangtze River Basin, China
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The use of controlled-release urea (CRU) has been recommended over that of conventional urea to improve rice grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency. However, the underlying agronomical and physiological mechanisms need to be better understood. In this study, field trials over four site-years, and a big container experiment were carried out to explore CRU effects on rice yield and NUE, with the main aims to identify the key yield components contributing to the superior rice yield with CRU use, and to evaluate differences in dry matter, nitrogen (N) accumulation, translocation and yield formation with different N fertilizer practices. Four N treatments were investigated: control with 0 kg N ha(-1) (CK), farmers' fertilizer practice (FFP) with 150 kg N ha(-1) as urea basal application, modified fertilizer practice (MFP) with 150 kg N ha(-1) as split urea application (40% at transplanting, 30% at tillering and 30% at the panicle stages), and CRU treatment with 150 kg N ha(-1) as CRU basal application. Results showed that the CRU increased rice yields by 10.8 and 5.6% over FFP and MFP, respectively. The N recovery efficiency and N agronomic efficiency for CRU were significantly higher than that obtained from MFP and FFP treatments. The analysis of yield components revealed that the higher grain yields using CRU were accounted formainly by increased panicle and spikelet numbers per m(2), which resulted from higher N uptake. In addition, results from the container experiment with comparable experimental design to field trials illustrated that both post-anthesis dry matter production and translocation were critical for high grain yields using CRU, while the former seemed more important. Relative to MFP and FFP, CRU maintained higher flag leaf SPAD and photosynthetic rate, as well as higher root oxidation activity (ROA) and N uptake during grain filling. Furthermore, CRU increased the activities of key enzymes involved in N assimilation in flag leaves, including GS, GOGAT, and NR. CRU effects on such underground and aboveground processes were proposed to contribute to high rice yield.

TI High-performance urea electrolysis towards less energy-intensive
   electrochemical hydrogen production using a bifunctional catalyst
   electrode
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB It is highly desirable but still remains a big challenge to develop earth-abundant bifunctional catalysts for urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis towards more energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen generation. In this study, we report that nickel phosphide nanoflake arrays on carbon cloth (Ni2P NF/CC) behave as a highly-active durable 3D catalyst electrode for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with the required potential of 0.447 V to achieve a geometrical catalytic current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. Remarkably, the high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Ni2P NF/CC enables it to be a bifunctional catalyst for both the UOR and HER towards energy-saving electrochemical hydrogen production, and its two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of only 1.35 V to attain 50 mA cm(-2), which is 0.58 V less compared with that required for pure water splitting to achieve the same current density, with remarkable long-term electrochemical durability and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.

TI A composite catalyst of sugarcane-derived N-doped biochar and
   Fe(NO3)3 for improved electron transfer in
   stepwise oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfuran under air
SO SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB Flexible catalysts for the efficient oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfuran (HMF) into valuable chemicals are in urgent demand. In this contribution, the sugarcane-derived N-doped biochar (Su-NCs) was prepared by MgCl2 activation in the presence of urea via a one-step pyrolysis method, which constructed a composite catalyst with Fe(NO3)(3) for HMF oxidation. The perfect combination of Su-NCs/Fe(NO3)(3) revealed remarkably enhanced catalytic performance and HMF conversion of ca. 100.0% with a 92.0% total yield in air. The effects of specific N-doping sites on the catalytic activity and role of Fe3+ were explored. The results disclosed the electron-rich pyridine-N and Fe3+ synergistically implemented the stepwise oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde and then carboxylic acid. Importantly, the Fe2+ came from electron transfer between the electron-rich N-doped sites and Fe3+ was the origin of reactive oxygen species (center dot O-2(-)), which further determined the reactivity and product distributions. The center dot O-2(-) was favorable for the oxidation of hydroxyl while the center dot OH evolved from center dot O-2(-) preferred to attack aldehyde on the furan ring. This work emphasizes the importance of surface electron transfer of Su-NCs on oxidation efficiency of HMF and creates an alternative chance to produce value-added chemicals from raw biomass.

TI EPA/DHA Concentrate by Urea Complexation Decreases Hyperinsulinemia and
   Increases Plin5 in the Liver of Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet
SO MOLECULES
AB Dietary intake of eicosapentaenoic/docosahexaenoic acid (EPA/DHA) reduces insulin resistance and hepatic manifestations through the regulation of metabolism in the liver. Obese mice present insulin resistance and lipid accumulation in intracellular lipid droplets (LDs). LD-associated proteins perilipin (Plin) have an essential role in both adipogenesis and lipolysis; Plin5 regulates lipolysis and thus contributes to fat oxidation. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of deodorized refined salmon oil (DSO) and its polyunsaturated fatty acids concentrate (CPUFA) containing EPA and DHA, obtained by complexing with urea, on obesity-induced metabolic alteration. CPUFA maximum content was determined using the Box-Behnken experimental design based on Surface Response Methodology. The optimized CPUFA was administered to high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice (200 mg/kg/day of EPA + DHA) for 8 weeks. No significant differences (p> 0.05) in cholesterol, glycemia, LDs or transaminase content were found. Fasting insulin and hepatic Plin5 protein level increased in the group supplemented with the EPA + DHA optimized product (38.35 g/100 g total fatty acids) compared to obese mice without fish oil supplementation. The results suggest that processing salmon oil by urea concentration can generate an EPA+DHA dose useful to prevent the increase of fasting insulin and the decrease of Plin5 in the liver of insulin-resistant mice.

TI Fe-Doped Ni2P/NiSe2 Composite Catalysts for Urea
   Oxidation Reaction (UOR) for Energy-Saving Hydrogen Production by
   UOR-Assisted Water Splitting
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The development of efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) catalysts helps UOR replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Here, we prepared Fe-doped Ni2P/NiSe2 composite catalyst (Fe-Ni2P/NiSe2-12) by using phosphating-selenizating and acid etching to increase the intrinsic activity and active areas. Spectral characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrated that electrons flowed through the Ni-P-Fe-interface-Ni-Se-Fe, thus conferring high UOR activity to Fe-Ni2P/NiSe2-12, which only needed 1.39 V vs RHE to produce the current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, this potential was 164 mV lower than that required for the OER under the same conditions. Furthermore, EIS demonstrated that UOR driven by the Fe-Ni2P/NiSe2-12 exhibited faster interfacial reactions, charge transfer, and current response compared to OER. Consequently, the Fe-Ni2P/NiSe2-12 catalyst can effectively prevent competition with OER and NSOR, making it suitable for efficient hydrogen production in UOR-assisted water electrolysis. Notably, when water electrolysis is operated at a current density of 40 mA cm(-2), this UOR-assisted system can achieve a decrease of 140 mV in the potential compared to traditional water electrolysis. This study presents a novel strategy for UOR-assisted water splitting for energy-saving hydrogen production.

TI Exploring Synthesis Approaches of Co-based Catalysts for the Efficient
   Oxidation of CH4 and CO
SO TOPICS IN CATALYSIS
AB Co-based catalysts were synthesized and studied as novel oxidation catalysts, exploring and optimizing the effect of synthesis method on the redox behavior, the oxygen storage ability and thus the catalytic performance of the derived Co3O4 materials in the complete CH4 and/or CO oxidation reactions. Thus, a series of Co-based catalysts were synthesized applying either the precipitation and/or the hydrothermal method, using different precipitating agents (Na2CO3, NH3, urea or NaOH), Co precursor salt (nitrate or acetate) and finally varying the Co/Na ratio. In addition, the reaction time (6 or 24 h aging) was also investigated for the hydrothermally prepared Co3O4. The best catalysts for the CH4 oxidation are the precipitated Co3O4, using cobalt acetate as precursor salt and NaOH as precipitating agent, presenting the highest surface areas and the lowest Co3O4 particle sizes. On the other side, hydrothermally prepared cobalt oxides reveal higher performance for CO oxidation, with Co3O4 prepared with cobalt acetate, NaOH and low aging time shown as the optimum materials. The best catalysts were further promoted with incorporation of Pd (0.5wt.%) and explored for both reactions. The addition of Pd enhanced the activity of Co3O4 for CH4 oxidation, while Pd did not improve any further the catalyst performance for CO oxidation, presenting thus the same activity with pure cobalt oxides.

TI Modified Solution Combustion Synthesis (SCS) of nickel oxide, NiO sphere
   clusters using glucans and sodium salts: Application for
   electrocatalytic decomposition of urea
SO MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS
AB The application of metabolites from the modern clinic (patient care environments including hospitals and medical facilities) has become an important part of energy research as these materials are readily available at low-cost and are non-toxic to handle in large quantities for catalyst development in the chemical industry. A modified Solution Combustion Synthesis (SCS) route was utilized in the preparation of nickel oxide, NiO nanomaterials using Dextran/Trisodium Citrate Dihydrate and Dextran/Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose (Na-CMC). The catalysts were then applied towards the electrocatalytic decomposition of urea, a metabolite from human and animal urine for Direct Urea Fuel Cell (DUFC) technology. Results from the catalysis demonstrated that the sample prepared via Dextran/Trisodium Citrate Dihydrate had the greatest Electroactive Surface Area (ESA) of 146 cm(2)/mg, potentially a result of the well-defined clusters produced using the citrate coordinating species to produce individual particles.

TI High efficiency UOR electrocatalyst based on crossed nanosheet
   structured FeCo-LDH for hydrogen production
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB To improve efficiency of hydrogen production, other anodic reactions with lower theoretical potential like urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to replace OER were explored. Herein, we synthesized FeCo layered double hydroxide (FeCo-LDH) in situ on nickel foam (NF) that had excellent OER and UOR catalytic ability and durability. The good catalytic performance can be attributed to the special crossed nanosheet structured FeCo-LDH with large specific surface area, rapid electron transfer. At the current density of 50 mA cm-2, the overpotential is 228 mV during OER, and the voltage value is 1.353 V vs. RHE during UOR. When FeCo-LDH was used as electrocatalyst, the voltages required for water and urea electrolysis to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2 are 1.523 V and 1.409 V, respectively. The strategy of constructing FeCo-LDH on NF plays an important role in high efficiency hydrogen production, and has great application prospects in sustainable energy efficient conversion.

TI Superior catalytic activity of α-Ni(OH)2 for urea
   electrolysis
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Ni(OH)(2) shows great promise as an electrocatalyst for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which can be employed in energy conversion devices such as direct urea fuel cells. The stacking of nickel hydroxide layers with different chemistries results in diverse crystal structures of nickel hydroxide. Compared to the beta phase, alpha-Ni(OH)(2) allows more than one electron transfer during redox transition, which is beneficial to energy conversion applications. This study reveals that the synthesized alpha-Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalyst exhibits higher current responses (increased by 138% at 1.5 V vs. RHE), a lower slope in the Tafel plot (89 vs. 121 mV dec(-1)), and an improved reaction rate constant (increased by 290%) for the UOR in comparison with its nickel hydroxide counterpart (i.e., beta-Ni(OH)(2)). Moreover, quantitative analyses based on the normalized current responses with respect to the double-layer electrochemical surface area of the nickel hydroxide electrodes indicate the higher intrinsic UOR catalytic activity of the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst. More importantly, the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst exhibits superior stability toward urea electrolysis in a 20 000 s test without noticeable degradation of the catalyst.

TI Boosting NO removal performance of selective catalytic reduction with
   NH3 on hydrotalcite derived NiCuFe mixed oxides synthesized
   via urea hydrothermal method
SO REACTION KINETICS MECHANISMS AND CATALYSIS
AB NiCuFe layered double oxide (LDO) catalysts were synthesized using co-precipitation, impregnation, and urea hydrothermal methods. The NH3-SCR activity of NiCuFe-LDO catalysts was investigated to determine the effect of different synthesis methods. All NiCuFe-LDO samples exhibited good catalytic performance at low temperatures, with the sample synthesized using the urea hydrothermal method (NiCuFe-LDO-3) being the most efficient catalyst. The NiCuFe-LDO-3 catalyst achieved over 80% NO conversion in the temperature range of 180(degrees)C to 280 C-degrees, with a peak of 95.13% at 240(degrees)C. The physicochemical properties of the samples were systematically characterized using XRD, SEM, BET, NH3-TPD, H-2-TPR, XPS, and in-situ DRIFTS. The results showed that the NiCuFe-LDO-3 sample had the best crystallinity, as demonstrated by XRD and SEM. BET analysis revealed that the NiCuFe-LDO-3 sample had the largest specific surface area. The NiCuFe-LDO-3 sample was found to have more acidic sites and a better redox capacity than the other samples, according to the H-2-TPR and NH3-TPD results. In-situ DRIFTS analysis showed that the catalyst operates through both E-R and L-H reaction mechanisms.

TI Boosting hydrogen production via urea electrolysis on an amorphous
   nickel phosphide/graphene hybrid structure
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Overall urea electrolysis has favorable thermodynamic properties and can complement traditional water splitting by simultaneously purifying urea-rich waste streams. However, the kinetics of the reaction is slow and more efficient catalysts are required. In this work, we describe a facile way to fabricate amorphous nickel phosphides on graphene nanosheets (a-Ni2P/G), which shows high efficient performance for overall urea electrolysis. The a-Ni2P/G catalyst has abundant surface area for abundant catalytic active sites and high proportion of Ni3+ active sites, realizing a superior intrinsic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Impressively, the a-Ni2P/G catalyst requires only much lower potentials of 1.28 V and - 0.1 V for UOR and HER at 10 mA cm(-2). The assembled a-Ni2P/G parallel to a-Ni2P/G electrolyzer needs a small cell voltage of 1.39 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work highlights a promising pathway to develop a cost-efficient catalyst for energy-saving H-2 generation combined with waste water purification.

TI Ni(OH)2 as Hole Mediator for Visible Light-Induced Urea
   Splitting
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Urea is a small molecule produced in millions of tons per day and is ubiquitous in nature. Biological treatment is commonly used to oxidize the urea wastewater produced each day across the world, which produces additional solid waste and eliminates any potential for utilizing the stored chemical energy within. A solar waste-to-fuels concept is presented to synergistically produce hydrogen fuel from visible sunlight while remediating urea wastewaters. A cascade semiconductor-catalyst electrode assembly was designed to drive the photo conversion of urea to hydrogen. Proper band energy alignment facilitates catalyst activation via hole transfer across the semiconductor catalyst interface. Specifically CdS-sensitized TiO2 with Ni(OH)(2) urea electrocatalyst on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass was employed as photoanode. The steady-state response of the semiconductor catalyst electrode is investigated in a photoelectrochemical cell, and charge transfer and recombination kinetics are elucidated to identify limiting charge-transfer reactions within the electrode architecture. Back electron transfer from semiconductor to catalyst is found to be competitive with urea oxidation reaction, which hinders steady-state photoconversion efficiency. Furthermore, the photoanode rapidly decomposes in urea electrolyte solutions as a result of the water-mediated photocorrosion of chalcogenide electrodes. Passivation of CdS with ZnS prior to catalyst deposition significantly improves open-circuit potential and photostability.

TI Safety of electrooxidation for urea removal in a wearable artificial
   kidney is compromised by formation of glucose degradation products
SO ARTIFICIAL ORGANS
AB A major challenge for the development of a wearable artificial kidney (WAK) is the removal of urea from the spent dialysate, as urea is the waste solute with the highest daily molar production and is difficult to adsorb. Here we present results on glucose degradation products (GDPs) formed during electrooxidation (EO), a technique that applies a current to the dialysate to convert urea into nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen gas. Uremic plasma and peritoneal effluent were dialyzed for 8 hours with a WAK with and without EO-based dialysate regeneration. Samples were taken regularly during treatment. GDPs (glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone) were measured in EO- and non-EO-treated fluids. Glyoxal and methylglyoxal concentrations increased 26- and 11-fold, respectively, in uremic plasma (at [glucose] 7 mmol/L) and 209- and 353-fold, respectively, in peritoneal effluent (at [glucose] 100 mmol/L) during treatment with EO, whereas no change was observed in GDP concentrations during dialysate regeneration without EO. EO for dialysate regeneration in a WAK is currently not safe due to the generation of GDPs which are not biocompatible.

TI TET2 is required to suppress mTORC1 signaling through urea cycle with
   therapeutic potential
SO CELL DISCOVERY
AB Tumor development, involving both cell growth (mass accumulation) and cell proliferation, is a complex process governed by the interplay of multiple signaling pathways. TET2 mainly functions as a DNA dioxygenase, which modulates gene expression and biological functions via oxidation of 5mC in DNA, yet whether it plays a role in regulating cell growth remains unknown. Here we show that TET2 suppresses mTORC1 signaling, a major growth controller, to inhibit cell growth and promote autophagy. Mechanistically, TET2 functions as a 5mC "eraser" by mRNA oxidation, abolishes YBX1-HuR binding and promotes decay of urea cycle enzyme mRNAs, thus negatively regulating urea cycle and arginine production, which suppresses mTORC1 signaling. Therefore, TET2-deficient tumor cells are more sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition. Our results uncover a novel function for TET2 in suppressing mTORC1 signaling and inhibiting cell growth, linking TET2-mediated mRNA oxidation to cell metabolism and cell growth control. These findings demonstrate the potential of mTORC1 inhibition as a possible treatment for TET2-deficient tumors.

TI Boosting C3H8 Oxidation at Low Temperature Over a
   Highly Dispersed Ir/TiO2 Catalyst
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB Iridium (Ir) nanoparticles with loadings of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 3 wt % were supported on TiO2 in the anatase phase by the deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) method and were evaluated as catalysts for the thorough oxidation of propane (C3H8). Ir/TiO2 was active in the total oxidation of C3H8 at low temperatures (150-300 degrees C). The C3H8 oxidation reaction rate and turnover frequency values were improved with increasing iridium loadings until 1.8 wt %, featuring the following order: 1.8Ir/TiO2 > 3Ir/TiO2 > 1.2Ir/TiO2 > 0.6Ir/TiO2 > TiO2. HAADF-STEM exhibited that iridium was spread over the TiO2 anatase surface, displaying average particle sizes ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 nm. XPS analysis revealed a mixture of Ir-0/Ir2+ species deposited on the TiO2 surface, and their ratio was dependent on the treatment gas (air or hydrogen). Pyridine thermo-desorption revealed high Lewis acidity, which increased with higher iridium loadings, showing different behavior patterns in the thoroughly oxidized C3H8. Characterization of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts conducted by in situ DRIFTS tests unveiled the presence of acetone and aldehyde species as the main reaction intermediates when the samples were treated under hydrogen conditions. Additional ex situ characterizations such as H-2-TPR, BET, and XRD were also carried out and discussed.

TI Plasmonic Au/TiO2 nanostructures for glycerol oxidation
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Au nanoparticles supported on P25 TiO2 (Au/TiO2) were prepared by a facile deposition-precipitation method with urea and investigated for surface plasmon-assisted glycerol oxidation under base-free conditions. Au/TiO2 samples were characterized in detail by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The adopted synthetic methodology permits deposition of Au nanoparticles with similar mean particle sizes up to 12.5 wt% loading that allows for the evaluation of the influence of the Au amount (without changing the particle size) on its photocatalytic performance for glycerol oxidation. The reaction conditions were optimized by carrying out a systematic study with different Au loadings on TiO2, reaction times, temperatures, catalyst amounts, O-2 pressures and Au particle sizes for photocatalytic reactions as well as traditional heterogeneous catalysis. It has been shown that visible light irradiation during the reaction has a beneficial effect on the conversion of glycerol where the best catalytic results were observed for 7.5 wt% Au loading with an average particle size of around 3 nm. The main product observed, with selectivities up to 63%, was high-value dihydroxyacetone that has important industrial applications, particularly in the cosmetic industry.

TI Freestanding (Ni4Zn)0.8 Intermetallic Nanosheets
   as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Production
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB The electrochemical oxidation of urea provides an efficient and energy-saving method for the treatment of wastewater containing urea along with hydrogen production. However, it is crucial to develop electrocatalysts possessing both high electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability. In this study, a (Ni4Zn)(0.8) intermetallic catalyst is deposited on nickel foam (labeled as (Ni4Zn)(0.8)/NF) by a rapid one-step electrodeposition technique. The as-deposited intermetallic catalyst can facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) simultaneously, displaying obvious bifunctional characteristics. Benefiting from metal-metal electronic modulation, the (Ni4Zn)(0.8)/NF integral electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 45 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 54.35 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution for the HER; meanwhile, the as-obtained electrode requires only 1.40 V voltage to achieve the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. Employing the as-prepared (Ni4Zn)(0.8)/NF electrode as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the urea-assisted water electrolysis device (HER||UOR system) exhibits a voltage reduction of 258 mV against the conventional water electrolysis device (HER||OER system), which offers a catalyst selection for the HER||UOR in practical application.

TI Total Oxidation of Propane Using CeO2 and CuO-CeO2
   Catalysts Prepared Using Templates of Different Nature
SO CATALYSTS
AB Several CeO2 and CuO-CeO2 catalysts were prepared using different methods, i.e., a homogeneous precipitation with urea, a nanocasting route using CMK-3 carbon as a hard template and a sol-gel process using Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer as a soft template, and tested in the total oxidation of propane. The catalysts were characterized by a number of physicochemical techniques (XRD, N-2 adsorption, TPR, XPS, Raman spectroscopy) showing distinct characteristics. For each series, Cu-Ce-O catalysts with low Cu-loadings (5 wt % CuO) showed the highest activity, higher than those samples either without copper or with high Cu-loading (13 wt % CuO). The incorporation of copper leads to an increase of the concentration of bulk defects but if the Cu-loading is too high the surface area drastically falls. The highest activity in the total oxidation of propane was achieved by Cu-containing ceria catalysts synthesized using a polymer as a template, as this method yields high surface area materials. The surface area and the number of bulk/sub-surface defects of the ceria seem to be the main properties determining the catalytic activity.

Herein, we report a direct chemical synthesis of atomically thick Ni(OH)(2)-NMs by a NaBH4 assisted cyanogel hydrolysis method, which overcomes the shortcoming of the post-etching method for NM synthesis. Various physical characterization methods show that the as-synthesized Ni(OH)(2)-NMs have 1.7 nm thickness, a big surface area, abundant nanoholes, and numerous surface/edge atoms with low-coordination numbers. The as-synthesized Ni(OH)(2)-NMs show a better electrocatalytic performance for the urea oxidation reaction than conventional Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles without holes in the alkaline electrolyte, including a lower onset oxidation potential, faster reaction kinetics, and higher mass activity.

TI Oxidation-Sensitive Supramolecular Polymer Nanocylinders
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB This study reports the synthesis and solution self -assembly of a bis(urea) derivative decorated with a poly(ethylene oxide) chain and an electroactive tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) unit into oxidation-sensitive supramolecular nanocylinders. As evi-denced by cryo-transmission electron microscopy and light scattering experiments, the preparation pathway has a strong influence on the morphology and characteristics of the self -assembled structures, proving their frozen (out-of-equilibrium) nature. The targeted supramolecular nanocylinders could be obtained both in an aqueous medium and acetonitrile. In water, TTF can be chemically oxidized to TTF & BULL;+ by Fe(III), resulting in a very moderate disruption of the supramolecular nanocylinders. On the contrary, TTF can be oxidized up to TTF2+ with the same oxidant in acetonitrile, leading to an almost complete disruption of the nanocylinders. Oxidation of TTF eventually leads to its degradation in both solvents, even in the absence of oxygen and light. This paper shows that oxidation-sensitive supramolecular nanocylinders can be prepared in acetonitrile by combining bis(urea) and TTF units into a polymer.

TI A simple strategy to tune α-MnO2 and enhance VOC oxidation
   via precipitation rate control
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Manganese dioxide (MnO2) has been widely used in environmental catalysis. The precipitation method is commonly used for preparing MnO2 in industrial applications, but always leads to unsatisfactory removal efficiency due to the intense precipitation rates of the metal precursors. Herein, a simple strategy was designed to control the precipitation rate. On the basis of 2MnO(4) (aq) + 2NH(4)(+) (aq) = N-2 (g) + 2MnO(2) (s) + 4H(2)O (l), the precipitation rate was well regulated by the release of NH4+ in solution. Different precipitants with various release rates of NH4+ (i.e. urea, ammonium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate) were investigated. The lower precipitate rate obtained by urea is favorable for the formation of nanoparticle-like MnO2 with larger surface area and stronger catalytic activity than the nanorods and bulk MnO2 obtained with ammonium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, respectively. The precipitate rate could be further optimized by changing the amount of urea to obtain the optimal MnO2 catalysts, which were efficiently applied in the complete catalytic oxidation of VOC, mineralizing 100% of 1000 ppm of ethyl acetate into CO2 at 200 degrees C under a high GHSV of 78,000 h(-1). Various characterization methods combined to reveal that the morphology, surface Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio, surface oxygen species and low-temperature reducibility determined the excellent catalytic performance. This work provides a new strategy for tuning MnO2 and enhancing VOC elimination via improved precipitation methods.

   Electro-Oxidation in Alkaline Medium
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB To achieve high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and avoid carbon support and binder in the anode catalyst of direct ethanol fuel cell, herein, we design freestanding core-shell nickel@palladium-nickel nanowire arrays (Ni@Pd-Ni NAs) without carbon support and binder for high-efficiency ethanol electro-oxidation. Bare Ni nanowire arrays (Ni NAs) are first prepared using the facile template-assistant electrodeposition method. Subsequently, the Ni@Pd-Ni NAs are formed using one-step solution-based alloying reaction. The optimized Ni@Pd-Ni NA electrode with a high ECSA of 64.4 m(2) g(-1)Pd exhibits excellent electrochemical performance (peak current density: 622 A g(-1)Pd) and cycling stability for ethanol electro-oxidation. The facilely obtained yet high-efficiency core-shell Ni@Pd-Ni NA electrode is a promising electrocatalyst, which can be utilized for oxygen reduction reaction, urea, hydrazine hydrate, and hydrogen peroxide electro-oxidation, not limited to the ethanol electro-oxidation.

SO MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS
AB Oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides and oxidative coupling of thiols into their corresponding disulfides were carried out using urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP) as oxidizing agent and immobilized Ni or Cd complexes on MCM-41 as stable, heterogeneous, efficient and recoverable catalysts under mild reaction conditions. These supported complexes were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. A variety of aromatic and aliphatic sulfides and thiols with different functional groups were successfully oxidized with short reaction times in good to excellent yields at room temperature. Catalysts were easily recovered and reused for several consecutive runs without significant loss of their catalytic activity and efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Mechanism of microwave-assisted coal desulfurization with urea peroxide
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB To effectively remove organic sulfur from coal for higher resource efficiency, an innovative microwave-assisted urea peroxide for desulfurization system was designed. The experimental group with different microwave frequencies and the conventional pyrolysis control group were set up to prove the desulfurization effect of microwave in coordination with urea peroxide. The experimental results showed that under 1000 W microwave irradiation and the promotion of urea peroxide, the desulfurization efficiency can reach 67.29 %, with an increase of 38.32 % while the conventional pyrolysis is only 28.97 %. According to the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, the effectiveness of microwave coordination with urea peroxide for desulfurization is explained from macroscopic point of view. Benzylidene thiol, dibenzyl sulfide, and dibenzyl disulfide were selected as model compounds for the quantum chemical calculation. The simulation results demonstrated that the changes in the pathway energy barriers for desulfurization align with the experimental material transformations, confirming the accuracy of the simulation. The sulfur-containing bonds of mercaptans will be destroyed to form hydrogen sulfide, and the undestroyed bonds will remain in the organic matter. After being oxidized, the sulfur containing bond will break to form a water-soluble sulfonic acid free radical. The unoxidized sulfur bonds of thioethers will be destroyed to generate unstable phenyl free radicals and free sulfur radicals. To achieve stability, phenyl free radicals can pair to form diphenylethane or combine with other radicals (such as center dot H). In contrast, sulfur free radicals can only react with hydrogen radicals to form hydrogen sulfide. However, the limited availability of hydrogen radicals in the system restricts the desulfurization efficiency. After oxidation by urea peroxide, the thioethers will form sulfones. The sulfur-containing bonds will be fractured and directly generate phenyl and sulfur dioxide, which reduces the dependence on hydrogen free radicals. The threedimensional desulfurization path of microwave collaboration with urea peroxide experiment was simulated and converted to the analytical bond breaking and formation mechanism. This study proved that microwave synergizes with urea peroxide can intensify the desulfurization process. It provides a high-efficiency method for the clean and green utilization of coal, which is conducive to supporting environmentally sustainable development.

TI Hybrids of Sterically Hindered Phenols and Diaryl Ureas: Synthesis,
   Switch from Antioxidant Activity to ROS Generation and Induction of
   Apoptosis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB The utility of sterically hindered phenols (SHPs) in drug design is based on their chameleonic ability to switch from an antioxidant that can protect healthy tissues to highly cytotoxic species that can target tumor cells. This work explores the biological activity of a family of 45 new hybrid molecules that combine SHPs equipped with an activating phosphonate moiety at the benzylic position with additional urea/thiourea fragments. The target compounds were synthesized by reaction of iso(thio)cyanates with C-arylphosphorylated phenols containing pendant 2,6-diaminopyridine and 1,3-diaminobenzene moieties. The SHP/urea hybrids display cytotoxic activity against a number of tumor lines. Mechanistic studies confirm the paradoxical nature of these substances which combine pronounced antioxidant properties in radical trapping assays with increased reactive oxygen species generation in tumor cells. Moreover, the most cytotoxic compounds inhibited the process of glycolysis in SH-SY5Y cells and caused pronounced dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane of isolated rat liver mitochondria. Molecular docking of the most active compounds identified the activator allosteric center of pyruvate kinase M2 as one of the possible targets. For the most promising compounds, 11b and 17b, this combination of properties results in the ability to induce apoptosis in HuTu 80 cells along the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Cyclic voltammetry studies reveal complex redox behavior which can be simplified by addition of a large excess of acid that can protect some of the oxidizable groups by protonations. Interestingly, the re-reduction behavior of the oxidized species shows considerable variations, indicating different degrees of reversibility. Such reversibility (or quasi-reversibility) suggests that the shift of the phenol-quinone equilibrium toward the original phenol at the lower pH may be associated with lower cytotoxicity.

TI Insights into the Performance of Bimetallic Ru-Co/TiO2
   Catalysts Carrying out a Low Temperature C3H8
   Oxidation Reaction
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB The performance of a set of bimetallic Ru-Co catalysts dispersed on the TiO2 anatase phase, synthesized by the co-deposition-precipitation with urea method, was tested in the CO2 production by the entire oxidation of C3H8. The presence of properly dispersed ruthenium nanoparticles on a Co/TiO2-anatase support was notably favorable for enhancing the C3H8 activity/selectivity. Likewise, an increase in the combined acidity (Bronsted and Lewis) was also observed, and the interaction between Ru-0-CoOx species stabilized on TiO2 prompted the C(3)H(8 )oxidation at low temperature. The performance of bimetallic Ru-Co/TiO2 catalysts was enhanced by increasing Ru0 species and loading, showing more efficient C3H8 oxidation by the combination of Ru-0-CoOx, as revealed by DRIFTS, XPS, H2-TPR, and HAADF-STEM characterization outcomes. The higher acidity of the catalysts containing Ru (1.5 wt%) and Co (3 wt%) as well as the reducibility enhancement of the Ru and Co species led to the best capacity of these catalysts for C3H8 oxidation to CO2 under the experimental conditions employed in this study.

TI A doping element improving the properties of catalysis: in situ
   Raman spectroscopy insights into Mn-doped NiMn layered double hydroxide
   for the urea oxidation reaction
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Elemental doping has been proved to be an efficient means to adjust the performance of Ni-based hydroxides for the electrochemical urea oxidation reaction. However, the mechanism by which elemental doping affects the catalytic activity of such bimetallic catalysts remains unclear and there is a lack of evidence. Herein, we dope Ni(OH)(2) with Mn, a typical dopant, and show that Mn doping reduces the onset potential of Ni hydroxide oxidation, which favors the generation of electrochemically active (NiOOH)-O-III, and increases the electrochemical reversibility of the Ni redox pair in NiMn layered double hydroxides (LDHs). In situ Raman spectroscopy analysis provides direct spectroscopic evidence that Mn promotes the production of high-valence (NiOOH)-O-III, specifically from ca. 0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO for Ni(OH)(2) to ca. 0.3 V vs. Hg/HgO for Ni0.2Mn0.8 LDHs, i.e., a negative shift of 100 mV. The Raman spectroscopy results also reveal that Mn doping elongates the Ni-O bond in NiOOH and leads to increased phase structure disorder. Consequently, the UOR performance of Ni1-xMnx LDH surpasses that of Ni(OH)(2). This study provides important information and a clear mechanistic explanation for the crucial roles of dopants in bimetallic electrocatalysts.

TI Ni-Mo-O nanorod-derived composite catalysts for efficient alkaline
   water-to-hydrogen conversion via urea electrolysis
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Photo/electrochemical splitting of water to hydrogen (H-2) fuel is a sustainable way of meeting our energy demands at no environmental cost, but significant challenges remain: for example, the sluggish anodic reaction imposes a considerable overpotential requirement. By contrast, urea electrolysis offers the prospect of energy-saving H-2 production together with urea-rich wastewater purification, whereas the lack of inexpensive and efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) catalysts places constraints on the development of this technique. Here we report a porous rod-like NiMoO4 with high oxidation states of the metal elements enabling highly efficient UOR electrocatalysis, which can be readily produced through annealing solid NiMoO(4)xH(2)O as a starting precursor in Ar. This precursor gives the derived Ni/NiO/MoOx nanocomposite when switching the shielding gas from Ar to H-2/Ar, exhibiting platinum-like activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes. Assembling an electrolytic cell using our developed UOR and HER catalysts as the anode and cathode can provide a current density of 10 milliamperes per square centimeter at a cell voltage of mere 1.38 volts, as well as remarkable operational stability, representing the best yet reported noble-metal-free urea electrolyser. Our results demonstrate the potential of nickel-molybdenum-based materials as efficient electrode catalysts for urea electrolysers that promises cost-effective and energy-saving H-2 production.

TI Predicting Conversion and Catalyst Performance of a De-hydrogen
   Catalytic Reactor in Urea Plant
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Explosion risk is one of the main reason a de-hydrogen catalytic reactor is installed in most urea fertilizer plants. The reactor removes hydrogen impurities from carbon dioxide by reacting hydrogen and oxygen to form water, with the help of platinum (Pt) catalysts. The de-hydrogen catalytic reactor must be monitored to keep the hydrogen outlet at less than 100 ppm. However, important parameters such as reactor conversion cannot be directly seen in the operator's panel. To address this challenge, a process simulation approach was employed to analyze and predict the conversion of the de-hydrogen catalytic reactor. The objectives of this study were to identify correlations between the de-hydrogen reactor conversion and various operating conditions, including temperature, hydrogen gas flow rate, and oxygen excess. Utilizing these correlations, a model was developed to predict de-hydrogen reactor conversion and estimate catalyst deactivation in a real-time monitoring system. Correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between hydrogen inlet molar flow rate and conversion, particularly when flow rates exceeded 4600 Nm3/day. A similar negative correlation was observed for the oxygen concentration at the outlet of the reactor, particularly at values above 7700 ppm. Conversely, a positive correlation was established between the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the reactor and hydrogen conversion. When this temperature difference was less than 5 degrees C for 0.1%-vol of hydrogen concentration, it was indicative of an impending deactivation of the platinum catalysts. The utilization of this prediction model, combined with its integration into a real-time monitoring system equipped with an early detection mechanism in the actual plant, would yield substantial advantages in terms of cost reduction for maintenance and extension of the catalyst's lifespan.

TI Use of a Wedge Scheme to Describe Intermolecular Proton-Coupled Electron
   Transfer through the H-bond Complex Formed Between a
   Phenylenediamine-Based Urea and 1,8-Naphthyridine
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Recently we introduced the wedge scheme as a convenient means to include H-bonded intermediates in an overall proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism by showing that it can nicely explain the unusual solvent- and concentration-dependent voltammetry of a phenylenediamine-based urea, U(H)H. This compound undergoes an apparent 1 e(-) reversible oxidation in CH2Cl2 that actually corresponds to 2 e(-) oxidation of half of the ureas to the quinoidal cation accompanied by transfer of a H+ and deactivation of the other half of the ureas. The reversibility of the process is due to the second electron transfer and proton transfer proceeding through a H-bond complex between the oxidized urea and the dimethylamino group on another urea. In this study the effect of adding 1,8-naphthyridine, naph, which H-bonds to the U(H)H in its reduced state, is examined using cyclic voltammetry. Addition of naph causes both an increase in the current of the reversible U(H)H cyclic voltammetric wave as well as the appearance of a new oxidation peak at slightly more positive potentials that gradually merges with the main wave as the naph concentration increases. This behavior can be explained by a transition from a U(H)H-U(H)H wedge scheme to a U(H)H-naph wedge, with the new second oxidation peak being due to the oxidation of the UHH-+naph H-bond complex. This complex is harder to oxidize than the UHH+-UHH complex due to weaker H-bonding of naph to U(H)H2+. Overall this study demonstrates the utility of the wedge scheme in explaining complex PCET reactions in which multiple types of H-bonding intermediates are involved.

TI MOF-derived Zn-Co-Ni sulfides with hollow nanosword arrays for
   high-efficiency overall water and urea electrolysis
SO GREEN ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT
AB Water electrolysis is a promising technology to produce hydrogen but it was severely restricted by the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we firstly reported an advanced electrocatalyst of MOF-derived hollow Zn-Co-Ni sulfides (ZnS@Co9S8@Ni3S2-1/2, abbreviated as ZCNS-1/2) nanosword arrays (NSAs) with remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), OER and corresponding water electrolysis performance. To reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the cell voltage of assembled ZCNS-1/2//ZCNS-1/2 for urea electrolysis (1.314 V) is 208 mV lower than that for water electrolysis (1.522 V) and stably catalyzed for over 15 h, substantially outperforming the most reported water and urea electrolysis electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations and experimental result clearly reveal that the properties of large electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) caused by hollow NSAs and fast charge transfer resulted from the Co9S8@Ni3S2 heterostructure endow the ZCNS-1/2 electrode with an enhanced electrocatalytic performance.

TI Degradation of oxytetracycline by ferrate(VI): Treatment optimization,
   UHPLC-MS/MS and toxicological studies of the degradation products, and
   impact of urea and creatinine on the removal
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The degradation of oxytetracycline (OTC) by ferrate(VI) for its application in wastewater treatment was investigated. The degradation conditions such as pH, reaction time, and molar ratio of ferrate(VI) to OTC were optimized by central composite design and response surface methodology. The most efficient, 90 % removal of OTC was obtained at pH 3, molar ratio ferrate(VI)/OTC of 3, and reaction time of 60 s. In the first step, demethylation, deamidation, and hydroxylation derivatives of OTC were formed. The end-products of the OTC degradation were hydroxyaliphatic amines and phenolic compounds formed from ring scission in the tetracene moiety of OTC. The end-products were not toxic to both bacteria (MARA and Microtox (R)) and protozoa (Spirotox) tests. Urea and creatinine are the major nitrogenous end-products of human metabolism occurring in municipal wastewater. Therefore, the impact of creatinine and urea on removal of OTC was also investigated. The presence of creatinine at investigated molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 did not affect the removal of OTC by ferrate(VI). The removal of OTC was 90 % after 60 s. However, after 60 s, in the presence of urea at molar ratio OTC/urea 1:1, removal efficiency was reduced from 90 to 80 %, whereas, at higher molar ratio of 1:2, the efficiency was 90 %. It may be explained by the formation of urea radicals that may facilitate the degradation of OTC by ferrate(VI) and its degradation products. The urea radicals may also induce formation of more reactive ferrate(V) or ferrate(IV) species. The ferrate was also applied to remove OTC from treated wastewater. Overall study results have shown that ferrate(VI) has a good potential for use in removal of tetracycline antibiotics from wastewater.

TI Harvesting energy from real human urine in a photo-microfluidic fuel
   cell using TiO2-Ni anode electrode
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The use of a liquid sample employed for analysis in microfluidic fuel cells has been increased because it can be used in order to obtain medical diagnostic and at the same time as fuel. This document presents the construction and evaluation of a photo-assisted microfluidic fuel cell (photo-mFC) that uses human urine as a fuel. For the construction of this photo-mu FC, TiO2 nanoparticles modified with Ni(OH)(2) were synthesized for use as a photoanode in the oxidation of the urea content in urine, finding an increase in the absorption of light in the visible spectrum with respect to TiO2. Nanoparticles of TiO2-Ni in a mixture of anatase (60%) and brookite (40%) phases were found with crystallite sizes of 9 and 15 nm, respectively. The photo-mFC proved with urine, showed an open-circuit potential of 0.70 V, a maximum current density of 1.7 mA cm(-2) and a maximum power density of 0.09mWcm(-2). The photo-mFC developed was evaluated for 15 consecutive hours at room temperature to observe the lifetime and stability of the photoanode with respect to the generated current. In addition, the oxidation of the urea by the photogenerated holes (hthorn) in the TiO2 was verified. This research shows the novelty of a promising advance in the use of a microfluidic fuel cell operated with a single-stream from human urine and using photoanodes (TiO2-Ni) to obtain electrical power with a feasible application in low power portable medical devices.

TI Ni2P/NiMoP heterostructure as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for
   energy-saving hydrogen production
SO ESCIENCE
AB Electrochemical water splitting is a sustainable and feasible strategy for hydrogen production but is hampered by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, an effective approach is introduced to significantly decrease the cell voltage by replacing the anodic OER with a urea oxidation reaction (UOR). A Ni2P/NiMoP nanosheet catalyst with a hierarchical architecture is uniformly grown on a nickel foam (NF) substrate through a simple hydrothermal and phosphorization method. The Ni2P/NiMoP achieves impressive HER activity, with a low overpotential of only 22 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a low Tafel slope of 34.5 mV dec -1 . In addition, the oxidation voltage is significantly reduced from 1.49 V to 1.33 V after the introduction of 0.33 M urea. Notably, a two-electrode electrolyzer employing Ni2P/NiMoP as a bifunctional catalyst exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a cell voltage of 1.35 V and excellent long-term durability after 80 h.

TI Amorphous nickel sulfoselenide for efficient electrochemical
   urea-assisted hydrogen production in alkaline media
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Amorphous Ni sulfoselenide on the surface of Ni(OH)2 nanoplate that is supported by nickel foam is synthesized, which demonstrates high activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation re action (UOR) in alkaline media. As for HER, the introduction of sulfur in Ni sulfoselenide not only increases the electrochemical active area, but also improves the water adsorption ability and provides an optimal adsorption site for hydrogen atom. As for UOR, the in-situ formed amorphous oxyhydroxide is believed as the real active species. The electrolyzer assembled by Ni sulfoselenide electrodes shows a low voltage of 1.47 at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M urea, which is much lower than that required for overall water splitting. The present work demonstrates an effective bifunctional electrode for HER and UOR that can be used to produce hydrogen and remove pollutant (urea) in water at the same time.

TI Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to Produce
   2,5-Diformylfuran Over Nitrogen Doped Porous Carbons
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) serves as a versatile platform compound bridging the realms of biomass resources and the fine chemicals industry, with its selective oxidation holding significant value. In this study, nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NDPC) materials were synthesized by using urea as the nitrogen source and sucrose as the carbon source via a hard-template approach. These materials were subsequently employed in the selective oxidation of HMF to produce 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) under specific oxygen pressure conditions. The morphology and structure of NDPC were elucidated through SEM, XPS and XRD analyses. The impact of varying the molar ratio of N/C and nitrogen sources on the catalyst was examined, as well as the effects of different reaction conditions on HMF conversion and DFF selectivity were investigated. The results demonstrated an impressive 81.0% HMF conversion and a remarkable 97.9% DFF selectivity under the suitable conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited consistent catalytic performance throughout the recycling experiments.

TI Highly selective urea electrooxidation coupled with efficient hydrogen
   evolution
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electrochemical urea oxidation offers a sustainable avenue for H2 production and wastewater denitrification within the water-energy nexus; however, its wide application is limited by detrimental cyanate or nitrite production instead of innocuous N2. Herein we demonstrate that atomically isolated asymmetric Ni-O-Ti sites on Ti foam anode achieve a N2 selectivity of 99%, surpassing the connected symmetric Ni-O-Ni counterparts in documented Ni-based electrocatalysts with N2 selectivity below 55%, and also deliver a H2 evolution rate of 22.0 mL h-1 when coupled to a Pt counter cathode under 213 mA cm-2 at 1.40 VRHE. These asymmetric sites, featuring oxygenophilic Ti adjacent to Ni, favor interaction with the carbonyl over amino groups in urea, thus preventing premature resonant C=N bond breakage before intramolecular N-N coupling towards N2 evolution. A prototype device powered by a commercial Si photovoltaic cell is further developed for solar-powered on-site urine processing and decentralized H2 production.

TI Oxidation of Nitrated Cellulose by the Microbial Community of Active

SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB The oxidation of native and nitrocellulose (NC) treated with ultraviolet radiation and ozone (UV + ozone) by the community of active sludge (AS) microorganisms of treatment facilities, as well as by the combination of AS with sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrio desulfuricans VKM B-1388 and microscopic fungi Fusarium solani VKM F-819, is studied. It is shown that the use of pretreatment significantly increases the degree of decomposition of NC during its subsequent biodegradation by the symbiosis of AS microorganisms with D. desulfuricans and F. solani. The use of mutagenic treatment of AS with nitrosomethyl urea (NMU) allows the biocenosis of AS microorganisms with a contaminant-NC to maintain a high oxidizing ability with good sedimentation properties for 65 days of incubation. The degree of NC decomposition is 24.36%.

TI NiO-MnOx/Polyaniline/Graphite Electrodes for Urea Electrocatalysis:
   Synergetic Effect between Polymorphs of MnOx and NiO.
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB In this work, we are enhancing the catalytic activity of the urea electrooxidation (UEO) process by using the composite of polyaniline (Pani), nickel oxide (NiO), and polymorphs of manganese oxide (MnOx) based on a graphite electrode. The hydro-gel method was used to prepare catalyst suspension with different ratios from NiO and MnOx. The chemical structures and surface morphology were characterized by employing the IR, XRD, and SEM/EDEX techniques. The catalytic activity of four modified electrocatalysts G/Pani/NiMn1, G/Pani/NiMn2, G/Pani/NiMn3, G/Pani/NiMn4 was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance. The kinetic parameters such as diffusion coefficient, Tafel slope, charge transfer coefficient, and surface coverage were calculated to choose the best electrocatalysts toward UEO in alkaline solution. The anodic current of new electrodes achieved about 16 mA.cm(-2) at potential of 550 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). Density functional theory studies (DFT) have been carried out to assess the adsorption energy between polyaniline (Pani) and the metal oxides.

TI Nanocrystalline ZrO2 and Pt-doped ZrO2 catalysts
   for low-temperature CO oxidation
SO Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology
AB Zirconia (ZrO2) nanoparticles were synthesized by solution combustion using urea as an organic fuel. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were performed in order to characterize the catalyst. The calculated crystallite size of ZrO2, calculated with the help of the Scherrer equation, was around 30.3 nm. The synthesized ZrO2 was scrutinized regarding its role as catalyst in the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO). It showed 100% CO conversion at 240 degrees C, which is the highest conversion rate reported for ZrO2 in literature to date. It is found that through solution combustion, Pt2+ ions replace Zr4+ ions in the ZrO2 lattice and because of this, oxygen vacancies are formed due to charge imbalance and lattice distortion in ZrO2. 1% Pt was doped into ZrO2 and yielded excellent CO oxidation. The working temperature was lowered by 150 degrees C in comparison to pure ZrO2. Further, it is highly stable for the CO reaction (time-on-stream approximate to 40 h). This is because of a synergic effect between Pt and Zr components, which results in an increase of the oxygen mobility and oxygen vacancies and improves the activity and stability of the catalyst. The effects of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and initial CO concentration on the CO oxidation over Pt(1%)-ZrO2 were studied.

TI Birdnest-like CuCeZr Mixed Oxides: Excellent Catalysts for Diesel
   Exhaust Oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF INORGANIC MATERIALS
AB A series of ternary composite oxides CuCeZrOx calcined at different temperatures were prepared by a homogeneous precipitation method using urea as the precipitant. X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), and temperature-programmed reduction (or desorption, oxidation) (TPR, TPD or TPO) measurements were utilized to investigate the influence of calcination temperatures on the physicochemical property and catalysis performance towards soot catalytic oxidation. The CCZ-350 (calcined at 350 degrees C) sample exhibits the optimized catalysis performance: temperature at the maximum rate of soot oxidation (T-50) = 407 degrees C, under test conditions of space velocity = 12000 mL/(g(catalyst).h), c(O-2) = 10vol%, c(NO) = 500x10(-6), and mass ratio of (loosely contacted) catalyst/soot = 10/1. It is believed that theabundant high-reactive adsorbed oxygen species on CCZ-350 surface contribute much to its outstanding catalysis performance. Besides, CCZ-350 with a loose-packing and porous morphology favors its sufficient contact with soot, thus further benefiting the catatlytic activity towards soot combustion. More importantly, CCZ-350 also presents good water vapor and SO2 resistence performance as well as good capability of eliminating other pollutants in diesel exhaust at low temperatures (150-400 degrees C), such as CO, C3H6 and C3H8.

TI Oxygen vacancies and surface reconstruction on NiFe
   LDH@Ni(OH)2 heterojunction synergistically triggering oxygen
   evolution and urea oxidation reaction
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The combination of heterostructure and oxygen vacancy is one of the effective strategies to enhance the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, NiFe LDH@Ni (OH)(2)-z p-n heterostructure with abundant oxygen vacancies was successfully fabricated by multi-step strategy as electrodeposition and in-situ etching. NiFe LDH@Ni(OH)(2)-z p-n heterostructure can modulate the D-band center to optimize the adsorption energies of hydroxides, while oxygen vacancies also con-tributed to increasing the amount of active sites and reducing charge transfer resistance during OER and UOR. In-situ UV-vis spectroscopy and Fourier transform a.c. voltammetry (FTACV) unveiled the surface reconstruction of NiFe LDH to generate Ni/FeOOH which facilitated the adsorption of the reaction inter-mediates and accelerated charge transfer during OER and UOR. As a result, NiFe LDH@Ni(OH)(2)-z presented the low overpotential of 250/290 mV at 100/200 mA cm(-2 ), small Tafel slope (43.6 mV dec-1) and excellent stability. The reaction order of OER with nearly unity indicated the fast adsorption process of OH-. NiFe LDH@Ni(OH)(2)-z also shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for UOR with 1.44 V at 100 mA cm(-2 )and Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1). This work offers a novel approach for the formation of p-n heterostructure with rich oxygen vacancies to engineer the electronic modulation and surface reconstruction for synergistically triggering OER and UOR.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Synergy between castor oil polyurethane/starch polymer coating and local
   acidification by A. niger for increasing the efficiency of
   nitrogen fertilization using urea granules
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB The volatilization of nitrogen (N) in the form of greenhouse gases is the most significant environmental impact associated with fertilizer use. Losses of N may exceed 50 % of the quantity applied, especially when the nitrogen source is urea. This work describes an overcoating system for urea granules, based on starch (from maize or cassava crops) and elemental sulfur (S degrees) composites applied over a castor oil-based poly(urethane) coating, biologically activated by Aspergillus niger (A. niger). The results indicated that the system provided good control of urea dissolution and reduced NH3 volatilization after 28 days by 45.9 and 64.9 % for the U4%St(A.niger) and U4%Ca-A.niger treatments, compared to the control (uncoated urea). This effect occurs from the synergy between the starch and oil-based polyurethane coatings, improving the microorganism activity, due to increased acidity production. The findings support the use of A. niger in fertilizer management and evidence the suitability of natural-based polymer coatings for controlling N delivery and reducing environmental impacts.

TI Experimental study on three additives used for the removal of nitrite, a
   byproduct of ozone oxidation denitration technology
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB Nitrogen oxides resulting from fossil fuel combustion are one of the major atmospheric pollutants. Ozone oxidation flue gas denitration technology has garnered significant attention for its benefits such as high efficiency, low temperature and simultaneous removal of multiple pollutants. However, the large amount of nitrite in the absorption products makes it prone to secondary pollution. A cost-effective and harmless treatment of the by-product nitrite will promote the ozone oxidation denitration technology. This study focused on investigating three different additives (ammonium chloride, ammonium carbonate, and urea) that can be added to react with nitrite and remove it in a harmless way. The effects of reaction temperature, initial nitrite ion concentration, reaction molar ratio, and initial pH on nitrite removal efficiency were explored. Combined with a wet spraying system, the synergistic removal of NOx/SO2 and by-product nitrite has also been studied. The experimental results revealed that with appropriate operating conditions and additives, the by-product nitrite can be efficiently removed while the system can achieve efficient removal of NOx/SO2. Among the three additives, ammonium carbonate was found to have the best overall removal effect. However, urea had an advantage over the other two additives in highly acidic and low-temperature slurry. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Effect of different surface functional groups on carbon supports toward
   methanol electro-oxidation of Pt nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB With an increased demand for efficient energy conversion system, nanoscale electrocatalysts have been intensively studied for high activity and stability. However, carbon support for nanoparticulate electrocatalyst has been generally thought to be inert for reaction pathway on metal nanocrystals. Therefore, material design for carbon support has mainly focused on development of high surface area with engineered pore structure, while surface state of the support has been largely neglected. Here, we demonstrate that surface functionalization of carbon support can modulate catalytic performance of Pt nanoparticle towardmethanol electro-oxidation. Vulcan carbon (VC) surface was successfully modified by either acid oxidation or urea annealing, resulting in oxygen-rich (O-VC) and nitrogen-rich (N-VC) surface states, respectively. Modified surface state of carbon supports were investigated with XPS spectra. With controlled experiments, uniform Pt nanoparticles (d similar to 5 nm) were deposited on each carbon support for the same electrochemical surface area. Through high-resolution XPS analysis, electronic transfer from nitrogen to Pt was monitored in Pt/N-VC. With electron-enriched surface, Pt/N-VC reveals less oxophilic surface property compared to Pt/VC and Pt/O-VC. Notably, methanol electro-oxidation reaction largely depended on types of functional groups. Compared to Pt/VC, methanol oxidation decreased 30% in oxygen-rich Pt/O-VC after surface oxidation, while reaction rate increased double in nitrogen-rich Pt/N-VC. From CO bulk oxidation result, improved MOR activity of Pt/N-VC is attributed to larger number of available Pt active sites from attenuated adsorption of oxygen species. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of surface engineering in carbon supports for electrocatalysis.

TI Crystalline Ni-Fe phosphide/amorphous P doped Fe-(oxy)hydroxide
   heterostructure as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for solar
   cell-driven hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Hydrogen production by electrocatalytic water splitting is considered to be an effective and environmental method, and the design of an electrocatalyst with high efficiency, low cost, and multifunction is of great importance. Herein, we developed a crystalline NiFe phosphide (NiFeP)/amorphous P-doped FeOOH (P-FeOOH) heterostructure (defined as P-NiFeOxHy) as a high-efficiency multifunctional electro-catalyst for water electrolysis. The NiFeP nanocrystals provide remarkable electronic conductivity and plenty of active sites, the amorphous P-FeOOH improves the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing spe-cies, and the crystalline/amorphous heterostructure with superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface generates synergistic effects, providing plentiful active sites and efficient charge/mass transfer. Benefiting from this, the designed P-NiFeOxHy displays ultralow overpotentials of 159.2 and 20.8 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, and also shows the superior performance of urea oxidation reaction with a low voltage of 1.37 V at 10 mA cm(-2 )in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. In-situ Raman spectra and ex-situ XPS analysis were also used to investigate the catalytic process and reveal the surface structure evolution of P-NiFeOxHy under electrochemical oxidation. Accordingly, the designed P-NiFeOxHy is employed as both cathode and anode to assemble into the urea-assisted water electrolysis device, which can reach 10 mA cm(-2) with a low 1.36 V and could be fur-ther driven by a solar cell. The work reveals a design of superior activity, cost-effective and multifunc-tional electrocatalysts for water splitting.

TI Urea Azines (Bisguanidines): Electronic Structure, Redox Properties, and
   Coordination Chemistry
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Urea azines are a largely neglected class of compounds. We show herein that they can easily be synthesized and sublimed at higher temperatures (90-100 degrees C) without decomposition. Our discussion includes the derivatives N,N-diisopropylurea azine (2), tetramethylurea azine (3), and N,N-dimethylethyleneurea azine (4) as examples. Vibrational spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations were used to study their electronic structure in detail. A clear trend in the calculated decomposition to N-2 and carbene is found, but the analysis reveals that this trend reflects the stability of the carbene decomposition product rather than changes in the electronic structure of the urea azines. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements we show that the urea azines are strong organic electron donors, which can be oxidized reversibly in two well-separated one-electron steps. The radical salt 4(TCNQ), featuring radical monocations and radical monoanions, which form mixed stacks in the solid state, was prepared by reaction of neutral 4 with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). Oxidation of 4 with silver salts Ag+X- (X = BF4 or PF6) was accompanied by dehydrogenation, leading to intensively red-brown colored radical azoimidazolium dyes. Furthermore, urea azines were used as chelating ligands. In the case of 2, coordination to late transition metals initiates tautomerization. Reaction of 2 with boron hydrides leads to hydrogen elimination and formation of new B,N bi-heterocyclic ring structures.

TI Communication-Highly Sensitive Ag/ZnO Nanorods Composite Electrode for

SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Sputtered Ag on zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod-structures grown on a carbon paper substrate were investigated as an electrocatalyst for non-enzymatic oxidation of urea. The Ag/ZnO nanorod-modified electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry in 1 M KOH electrolyte with 0.33 M urea. The synergetic electrochemical performance due to the combined Ag and ZnO nanorod materials shows a good sensitivity of 0.1622 mu A mu M(-1)cm(-2) with a low detection limit of 13.98 mu M. Simple and scalable fabrication of the electrode can make it a potential candidate for non-enzymatic urea sensor with reproducible and sensitive detection. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

TI Carbon nitride from urea: Mechanistic study on photocatalytic hydrogen
   peroxide production for methyl orange removal
SO CATALYSIS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Herein, we investigated the photocatalytic removal of methyl orange (MO) under 350 nm irradiation with carbon nitride (CN) nanoparticles from urea. Participation of photogenerated charge carriers and secondary reactive species in MO degradation process was evaluated by scavenging and photoelectrochemical assays. The experi-ments suggest that HO center dot radicals are not only formed from the reaction of water with photogenerated holes, but via a three consecutive one-electron reduction of O2 involving the formation of H2O2. The photocatalytic MO degradation mechanism was proposed. The present results emphasize the importance of charge carriers' sepa-ration in the optimization of CN photocatalysis for technological uses.

TI Synthesis and characterization of highly dispersed bimetallic Au-Rh
   nanoparticles supported on titanate nanotubes for CO oxidation reaction
   at low temperature
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Low-temperature CO oxidation was carried out by using rhodium incorporated into titanate nanotubes (Rh/NTs) prepared by the sol-gel and hydrothermal methods; otherwise, gold nanoparticles were deposited homogeneously onto the Rh/NT surface through the deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) method. The Au-Rh/NT sample exhibited high metal dispersion (55%), outstanding CO oxidation at low temperature, and better resistance to deactivation than the monometallic Rh/NT and Au/NT samples. The characterization of bimetallic samples, with particle sizes from 1 to 3 nm, revealed the remarkable presence of interacting Au and Rh species in metallic state. In this way, Au-0 and Rh-0 were answerable for the higher catalytic activity observed in the bimetallic samples. The interaction between Au and Rh in the nanoparticles of Au-Rh/NT promoted a synergistic effect on the CO oxidation reaction, explained by the creation of new CO adsorption sites.

SO APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB Oxo-vanadium(IV) Schiff base complex supported on MCM-41 as an organic-inorganic hybrid heterogeneous catalyst was synthesized with post-grafting of MCM-41 with 3-aminoropropyltrimethoxysilane and subsequent reaction with 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and then complexation with oxo-vanadium acetylacetonate salt. The catalyst was analysed using a series of characterization techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray diffraction, nitrogen absorption isotherm, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The data collected provided evidence that the vanadium complex was anchored onto MCM-41. High catalytic activity of this catalyst was observed in the oxidation of various sulfides and thiols (into sulfoxides and disulfides, respectively) with urea hydrogen peroxide as oxidant in high to excellent yields and selectivity under mild conditions. The heterogeneous catalyst could be recovered easily and reused several times without significant loss in catalytic activity and selectivity. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Enhancement of Urea Electrooxidation on PbO2-Ni/C and
   Bi2O3-Ni/C Nanocomposites in Alkaline Medium
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Development of efficient catalysts for urea electrooxidation is a current issue due to its ability to generate H-2 and its use as fuel for low-temperature fuel cells. In this work, non-precious Ni and Ni-metal oxide (PbO2 and Bi2O3) nanocomposites were prepared by electrodeposition technique and used as anodes for urea electrooxidation in NaOH solution. The surface characterizations were carried out by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The electrocatalytic activity was investigated by applying different electrochemical techniques. Remarkable catalytic activities and stabilities toward urea electrooxidation were recorded for PbO2-Ni/C and Bi2O3-Ni/C nanocomposites more than that of Ni/C. The recorded oxidation peak current densities on PbO2-Ni/C, Bi2O3-Ni/C and Ni/C are (80 mA cm(-2) at +570 mV), (27 mA cm(-2) at + 460 mV), and (18.5 mA cm(-2) at + 440 mV), respectively. The onset potentials of the oxidation processes shifted to lower potentials by values of + 40 mV and + 150 mV on Bi2O3-Ni/C and PbO2-Ni/C, respectively compared to that on Ni/C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed charge transfer resistance values of 6.8, 28.9 and 42.2 Omega cm(2) for PbO2-Ni/C, Bi2O3-Ni/C and Ni/C, respectively in urea solution at + 356 mV. Higher catalytic activity, exchange current density, diffusion coefficient, electron transfer rate and lower charge transfer resistance toward urea electrooxidation were recorded for Bi2O3-Ni/C and PbO2-Ni/C nanocomposites. The electrocatalytic performance was found in the order of PbO2-Ni/C > Bi2O3-Ni/C > Ni/C. Application of these nanocomposites in applications related to H-2 production, direct urea fuel cells, and water treatments is possible. (c) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

TI Enhanced photocatalytic toluene oxidation on CN species modified TiO2:
   Nitrogen doping state and anti-inactivation mechanism
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB The photocatalytic oxidation of toluene is limited by low mineralization and inactivation. Cheap carbon and nitrogen (CN) species on TiO2 provides an efficient strategy. CN species from the urea calcination in situ formed on TiO2 were denoted as UTx (x = 0.5, 1, 2), and UT1 photocatalyst had the best performance of ca. 90% conversion and 85% mineralization of toluene in light (& lambda; & GE; 400 nm, RH= 20%), with keeping for at least 720 min. The excellent activity of UT1 photocatalyst was resulted from the observed interstitial nitrogen and CN species with triple bonds. Because easily forming interstitial nitrogen resulted in isolated states and more negative VBM to generate hydroxyl radicals, and CN species with triple bonds was beneficial for transferring electrons and opening benzene rings. Therefore, quinone intermediates on UT1 were oxidized to 3-hydroxyglu-taric dialdehyde and deeply mineralized, while more accumulated benzaldehyde on TiO2 led to poorer stability.

AB Ultrathin nickel-metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) nanobelts, [Ni-20(C5H6O4)(20)(H2O)(8)]center dot 40H(2)O (Ni-MIL-77), have been exploited successfully for the fabrication of a non-enzymatic urea sensor. Ni-MOF ultrathin nanobelts in alkaline media can be used as an efficient catalyst for urea electrooxidation. As a non-enzymatic urea sensor, Ni-MOF ultrathin nanobelts exhibit a high sensitivity of 118.77 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), wide linear range of 0.01-7.0 mM, and low detection limit of 2.23 mu M (S/N = 3). The selectivity, stability and reliability of ultrathin Ni-MOF nanobelts towards urea oxidation are also investigated. Moreover, Ni-MOF ultrathin nanobelts were further used to detect urea in human body fluids. All these findings confirm that the urea sensor based on Ni-MOF ultrathin nanobelts is successfully prepared and promising for applications in medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring.

TI Catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide at low temperature using AuRh/
   TiO 2 bimetallic catalysts: Effect of the synthesis method
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB AuRh nanoparticles supported on TiO 2 P25 were synthesized by two sequential deposition methods: sequential deposition -precipitation with urea (DPU) and impregnation (IMP)-DPU. Segregated nanoparticles (Rh core Au shell ball -cup -type, and Janus -type arrangements) were observed in gold -rhodium bimetallic catalysts, but mainly ball -cup -type and Janus -type nanoparticles were found on catalysts prepared by IMP-DPU. XPS analysis of goldrhodium bimetallic catalysts, before and after reaction allowed concluding that gold -rhodium interaction on metallic state was an important factor to avoid the oxidation of rhodium during CO oxidation. However, this effect of stabilization of the rhodium metallic phase by gold does not fully explain the promoting effect observed for some bimetallic catalysts on CO oxidation. Some structural aspects such as the atomic arrangement of the bimetallic nanoparticles and the type of active sites, determined by DRIFTS -CO, were also considered. TPR and UV -visible DR spectroscopy characterizations also showed differences in the gold -rhodium interactions.

TI Highly Dispersed Gold Nanoparticles Supported on SBA-15 for Vapor Phase
   Aerobic Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Gold nanoparticles supported on SBA-15 are prepared by homogenous deposition-precipitation method (HOP) using urea as the precipitating agent. The structural features of the synthesized catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption (BET), pore size distribution (PSD), CO chemisorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalytic activity and stability of the Au/SBA-15 catalysts are investigated during the vapor phase aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The BJH pore size distribution results of SBA-15 support and Au/SBA-15 catalysts reveals that the formation of mesoporous structure in all the samples. TEM results suggest that Au nanoparticles are highly dispersed over SBA-15 and long range order of hexagonal mesopores of SBA-15 is well retained even after the deposition of Au metallic nanoparticles. XPS study reveals the formation of Au (0) after chemical reduction by NaBH4. The particle size measured from CO-chemisorption and TEM analysis are well correlated with the TOF values of the reaction. Au/SBA-15 catalysts are found to show higher activity compare to Au/TiO2 and Au/MgO catalysts during the vapor phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The catalytic functionality are well substantiated with particle size measured from TEM. The crystallite size of Au in both fresh and spent catalysts were measured from X-ray diffraction.

TI Deciphering the Role of Nickel in Electrochemical Organic Oxidation
   Reactions
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Organic oxidation reactions (OORs) powered by renewable energy sources are gaining importance as a favorable alternative to oxygen evolution reaction, with the promise of reducing the cell potential and enhancing the overall viability of the water electrolysis. This comprehensive review delves into the electrochemical oxidation of diverse organic compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, amines, and urea, as well as biomass-derived renewable feedstocks such as hydroxymethylfurfural and glycerol. The key focus centers on the role of nickel (Ni)-based catalysts for these OORs. The unique redox activity and chemical nature of Ni have been proven instrumental for the sustainable and cost-effective oxidation of various organic molecules more efficiently and selectively. This review article discusses how strategic choices, such as the selection of foreign metals, intercalating species, vacancies, defects, and a secondary element (e.g. chalcogens and non-metals), contribute to tuning the electrochemical performances of a Ni-based (pre)catalyst for OORs. Moreover, this review provides insights into the active species in various reaction environments and further explores reaction mechanisms, to apparent phase changes of the catalyst with the most relevant examples. Finally, the review not only elucidates the limitations of the current approaches but also outlines potential avenues for future advancements in OOR.

TI Improved Norfloxacin degradation by urea precipitation
   Ti/SnO2-Sb anode under photo-electro catalysis and kinetics
   investigation by BPneural-network-physical modeling
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The photo-electro catalysis has emerged as efficient and sustainable degradation method for antibiotics, where metal oxide anode plays a critical role. Exploring novel preparation method for anodes catalysis to achieve larger active sites and diverse oxidants production can directly enhance the degradation performance. Therefore, in this work, a new urea precipitation method for anode formation was studied. Both novel urea precipitation Ti/SnO2-Sb anode (TSSA-U) and traditional electro-deposition Ti/SnO2-Sb anode (TSSA-E) were prepared for Norfloxacin degradation by photo-electro catalysis in saline water. A unique tubular Ti/SnO2-Sb units formatted by urea precipitation resulted in higher porosity. This led to dominating advantage for TSSA-U on photo/electrochemical activity and degradation performances by individual photo/electro catalysis, compared to TSSA-E. However, this gap of degradation performances shrank when synergistic effect of photo-electro catalysis involved. The highest TOC removal ratio of 91.1% was obtained from TSSA-U under photo-electro catalysis. Besides, a novel BP-neural-network-physical modeling (BP-ANN-P) was developed for analysis. According to this modeling, both direct (adsorptiondegradation, radiation, etc.) and indirect (mainly .Cl) routes contributed significantly in degradation work by TSSA-U, where indirect route shared 41.8-90.1% of total degradation ratio. An increasing of current density (from 5 to 25 mA cm(-2)) enhanced the kinetics for both routes. Indirect route preferred pH = 3-7 with direct route enhanced by neutral condition. Moreover, indirect route also showed better adaptability with higher initial NOR loadings. Both urea precipitation and BP-ANN-P have shown their value for high performance material formation and data analysis, respectively. Notably, higher catalysis performance and better analysis connect to low energy cost, shorter running time and more efficient judgement and selection, which meets the requirement of cleaner production and environmental sustainability.

TI Application of urea hydrogen peroxide: Degradation of glyphosate in soil
   and effect on ammonia nitrogen effectiveness and enzyme activity
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Glyphosate is one of the most widely used pesticides globally. However, glyphosate and its residual metabolite, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), are persistent and mobile chemicals. Large amounts of glyphosate residue can accumulate in the environment, causing adverse effects in organisms. Urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in soil slow-release H2O2 undergoes a Fenton-like reaction with Fe2+, and the resulting hydroxyl radical (.OH) degrades glyphosate. This experiment investigated the effects of three fertilisers (UHP, ferrous sulphate, and urea) on the degradation of glyphosate in agricultural soils and their effects on soil ammonia nitrogen effectiveness and enzyme activity. Among all treatments, the half-life of glyphosate in the mixed application of UHP and ferrous sulphate was the shortest (11.9 d), and its degradation rate was the highest (70.64%), degrading within 28 d. Throughout the experimental cycle, in 1-7 d, the application of UHP reduced the effect on indigenous microorganisms and maintained nitrogen availability and enzyme activity in the soil; in 7-14 d, the mixed application of UHP and ferrous sulphate alleviated the nitrification of soil nitrogen and reduced the loss of ammonia from the soil; in 14-28 d, the mixed or single application of UHP and ferrous sulphate and the low dose of glyphosate remaining in the soil had a catalytic effect on enzyme activity, promoting the secretion of catalase and nitratase, which participate in soil glyphosate degradation and nitrogen cycling. Therefore, this study provides a scientific basis for the in-situ remediation of herbicide-contaminated soil in agricultural fields using chemical fertilisers.

TI Coordinated d-p hybridized hcp@fcc NiRu alloy doped by interstitial
   atoms for boosting urea-assisted simulated seawater electrolysis at
   industrial current densities
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The production of hydrogen through seawater electrolysis has recently garnered increasing concern. However, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by alkaline seawater electrocatalysis is severely impeded by the slow H 2 O adsorption and H* binding kinetics at industrial current densities. Herein, a face-centered cubic/hexagonal close packed (fcc/hcp) NiRu alloy heterojunction was fabricated on Ni foam (N doped NiRu-inf/NF) by a lowtemperature nitrogen plasma activation. Simultaneously, nitrogen atoms are introduced into the alloy to facilitate d -p hybridization. When N doped NiRu-inf/NF is integrated into a dual-electrode cell for urea-assisted seawater electrolysis, it achieves 100 mA cm -2 with an ultra-low voltage of 1.36 V and excellent stability. Density functional theory (DFT) verifies that the robust d -p hybridization among Ni, Ru and N exhibits more energy level matching for H 2 O molecule adsorption at the Ru sites, while simultaneously reducing the interaction between H* and Ni sites in N -doped NiRu-inf.

TI Electrochemical Oxidation of Glycine with Bimetallic Nickel-Manganese
   Oxide Catalysts
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB A simple template-free hydrothermal route followed by high-temperature (800 degrees C) annealing in air forms Ni-Mn bimetallic oxides, namely NiMn2O4, Ni1.5Mn1.5O4, and MnNi2O4, which are characterized by XRD, Raman, EDS, and SEM analysis. The electrocatalytic activity of these metal oxides toward the oxidation of glycine molecules in alkaline condition was studied by cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry methods. Among other nickel manganese bimetallic oxides and monometallic oxides (Mn2O3, NiO), Ni1.5Mn1.5O4 shows excellent redox characteristics with high oxidation current density (310 mu A cm(-2) at 0.43 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and lower onset potential (0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Additionally, Ni1.5Mn1.5O4 exhibits a moderate Tafel slope (78 mV dec(-1)) and is electrochemically stable, as confirmed from chronoamperometry, indicating its potential for glycine oxidation. The linear dependence of the oxidation current with glycine concentration signifies that the overall process is diffusion controlled. The electrochemical results suggest that bimetallic mixed Mn and Ni oxides are promising glycine oxidation catalysts, which may be attributed to the cooperative effect between different Ni and Mn elements.

TI High-performance IN738 superalloy derived from turbine blade waste for
   efficient ethanol, ethylene glycol, and urea electrooxidation
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB In this work, IN738 superalloy used previously in gas turbines was recycled and used as a working electrode for the electrooxidation of different fuels, namely ethylene glycol, ethanol, and urea. The electrocatalytic efficiency of the electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance. Several kinetics parameters like diffusion coefficient, Tafel slope, rate constant, and activation energy were calculated. The modified electrode was characterized as received using XRD, SEM, and EDAX to elucidate the crystal structure and surface morphology before and after electrochemical oxidation. The anodic current densities of electrochemical oxidation of ethanol, ethylene glycol, and urea were 29, 17, and 12 mA.cm(-2), respectively, in an alkaline solution at a potential of 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The kinetic parameters like diffusion coefficients for ethanol, ethylene glycol, and urea were found to be 1.5 x 10(-6), 1.038 x 10(-6), and 0.64 x 10(-6 )cm(2 )s(-1), respectively. The charge transfer resistances were estimated for electrooxidation of different fuels by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

TI Highly Efficient Au/ZnO-ZrO2 Catalysts for CO Oxidation at
   Low Temperature
SO CATALYSTS
AB A series of gold catalysts on ZnO-ZrO2 featuring nominal ZnO loads of 3, 5, and 10 wt. % were synthesized by the sol-gel method using Zn(NO3)(2) and zirconium (IV) propoxide aqueous solutions. In addition, gold catalysts with nominal loads between 1 and 3 wt. % were produced by the method of deposition-precipitation with urea, and their performance in the CO oxidation reaction at low temperature was evaluated. HRTEM outcomes revealed high gold dispersion on the 3Au/5ZnO-ZrO2 catalyst with Zn/Zr atomic ratio of (5/95) and 3 wt. % of gold, which showed the highest CO conversion at low temperature (-5 degrees C) under air treatment when the CO oxidation was carried out with a space velocity of similar to 46,000 h(-1). The incorporation of ZnO to ZrO2 provoked high dispersion of the gold nanoparticles on the support and close size distribution; moreover, the presence of Au1+ and Zr3+ species was increased by the Zr-O-Zn interaction, which was stronger than in the single Au/ZrO2 and Au/ZnO catalysts. DRIFT/GC-MS confirmed that the Au1+/Au-0 ratio and formation of carbonate species played an important role in determining the CO conversion; likewise, the 3Au/5ZnO-ZrO2 catalyst was stable at 10 degrees C for 24 h.

TI Urea and thiourea based coordination polymers and metal-organic
   frameworks: Synthesis, structure and applications
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Coordination polymers (CPs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are commonly constructed by self-assembly of metal ions and multidentate organic linkers and have gained a significant attention in the past two decades. Due to their structural properties, high chemical and thermal stability and tunable pore sizes, they show potential application in different areas, such as gas adsorption and separation, catalysis, sensing, drug delivery, etc. Moreover, their tunability with functional organic ligands is of unquestionably importance due to the limitless possibility of designing various functional organic linkers as well as the particular chemical properties of functional groups. Designing of CPs/MOFs by incorporating different functionalities can be undertaken either via direct synthesis or via modification of ligand or metal centre. Due to the conformational flexibility, strong hydrogen bonding capabilities and polarizability of the urea and thiourea groups, recently a significant attention has been dedicated to developing functionalized CPs/MOFs with such moieties. These functional groups decorated compounds can show not only attractive structures but also a significant improvement in gas adsorption, catalytic and sensing properties. Although this area of research has been developed remarkably in the last few years, it had not yet been reviewed. This review describes recent developments in urea and thiourea functionalized frameworks by discussing their synthesis, structure and applications. It addresses the different synthetic methodologies, followed by their structural description. Lastly, their applications on gas adsorptions and separation, heterogeneous catalytic reactions, and sensing are described. The effects of functional groups on the structure and applications of functionalized materials are also discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hard segment composition, morphology, tensile properties and
   biostability of linked-macrodiol based siloxane poly(urethane urea)
SO MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS
AB A series of siloxane poly(urethane urea)s (SiPUU) was synthesised to investigate variation of the molar ratio of urethane and urea linkages on morphology, tensile properties and in vitro oxidative stability. The soft segments of SiPUU were based on 20: 80 (w/w) mixture of 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) linked poly(hexamethylene oxide) and alpha,omega-bis(6-hydroxyethoxypropyl) polydimethylsiloxane. The hard segment content in these formulations was 45% (w/w) and composed of MDI and a mixture of 1,2-ethanediamine (EDA) and 1,3-bis (4-hydroxybutyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (BHTD) in varying molar ratios. Six SiPUU with 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mol-% of BHTD in the hard segment in combination with EDA were prepared. The synthesized SiPUU were characterized using size exclusion chromatography, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and tensile testing. The oxidative stability of the SiPUU samples was evaluated by an in vitro oxidative test method using a 20% H2O2 containing 0.1 mol/L CoCl2 solution on 150% strained dumbbells at 37 degrees C over a period of 60 days. The results showed that the modulus, tensile and tear strengths increased with increasing proportion of EDA in the hard segment. In SiPUU where the EDA content was 80% and above, a well-ordered hard segment was observed. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination confirmed that the SiPUU containing a mixture of chain extenders were oxidatively stable independent of the chain extender compositions. The SiPUU chain extended only with either BHTD or EDA showed minor surface changes. All SiPUU samples, except the one containing 100% BHTD in the hard segment, showed high ultimate tensile strength (25-35 MPa), elongation (400-870%) and tear strength (40-93 N/mm) with very good oxidative stability.

TI Particleboard bio-adhesive by glyoxalated lignin and oxidized dialdehyde
   starch crosslinked by urea
SO WOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A new bio-sourced adhesive system is presented based on urea crosslinked glyoxalated lignin and dialdehyde starch obtained by hydrogen peroxide oxidation of starch. The molecular species formed and the reactions mechanism involved were identified by FTIR, C-13 NMR, and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. Urea appears to react with both, glyoxalated lignin and dialdehyde starch. The adhesives based on this reaction were tested by means of laboratory particleboards, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermomechanical analysis (TMA). The results obtained for internal bond (IB) strength with this adhesive system are acceptable for producing particleboard according to the relevant European standards. Additionally, chemical crosslinking by using 5% on resin solids of partially bio-sourced glycerol glycidyl ether (GDE) improves the bonding strength of the resins so formed; the main crosslinking sites were also determined.

TI Molybdenum carbide/Ni nanoparticles-incorporated carbon nanofibers as
   effective non-precious catalyst for urea electrooxidation reaction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this study, molybdenum carbide and carbon were investigated as co-catalysts to enhance the nickel electro-activity toward urea oxidation. The proposed electrocatalyst has been formulated in the form of nanofibrous morphology to exploit the advantage of the large axial ratio. Typically, calcination of electropsun polymeric nanofibers composed of poly(vinyl alcohol), molybdenum chloride and nickel acetate under vacuum resulted in producing good morphology molybdenum carbide/Ni NPs-incorporated carbon nanofibers. Investigation on the composition and morphology of the proposed catalyst was achieved by XRD, SEM, XPS, elemental mapping and TEM analyses which concluded formation of molybdenum carbide and nickel nanoparticles embedded in a carbon nanofiber matrix. As an electrocatalyst for urea oxidation, the electrochemical measurements indicated that the proposed composite has a distinct activity when the molybdenum content is optimized. Typically, the nanofibers prepared from electrospun nanofibers containing 25 wt% molybdenum precursor with respect to nickel acetate revealed the best performance. Numerically, using 0.33 M urea in 1.0 M KOH, the obtained current densities were 15.5, 44.9, 52.6, 30.6, 87.9 and 17.6 mA/cm(2) for nanofibers prepared at 850 degrees C from electropsun mats containing 0, 5, 10, 15, 25 and 35 molybdenum chloride, respectively. Study the synthesis temperature of the proposed composite indicated that 1000 degrees C is the optimum calcination temperature. Kinetic studies indicated that electrooxidation reaction of urea does not follow Arrhenius's law.

TI Synthesis of N doped NiZnCu-layered double hydroxides with reduced
   graphene oxide on nickel foam as versatile electrocatalysts for hydrogen
   production in hybrid-water electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Water splitting is limited by the high theoretical potential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, which can reduce the energy efficiency. Nevertheless, replacing sluggish oxygen evolution by ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR)) of low theoretical potential is an energy-saving approach. In this paper, a new bifunctional catalyst of N doped NiZnCu-layered double hydroxides with reduced graphene oxide on nickel foam (N-NiZnCu LDH/rGO) is synthesized. To validate its electrochemical performance and stability, a two-electrode electrolyzer is constructed (N-NiZnCu LDH/rGO parallel to N-NiZnCu LDH/rGO). Experiments show that at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the voltages of AOR, UOR, and HzOR are 0.489 V, 1.305 V, and 0.010 V with a high stability (over 3000 CV cycles), which are much better than those of Pt/C parallel to IrO2. This study demonstrates N-NiZnCu LDH/rGO can replace precious metals for commercial hydrogen energy production in the hybrid-water electrolysis, and can be employed for treatment of industrial wastewater.

TI A review: current urea sorbents for the development of a wearable
   artificial kidney
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The wearable artificial kidney (WAK) holds great promise as a potential alternative to hemodialysis for treating end-stage renal disease (ESRD), offering patients longer and more frequent dialysis within a compact device. However, a critical challenge in developing a practical WAK lies in ensuring sufficient removal of urea, a key waste product in ESRD. Current developed urea removal technologies include enzymatic hydrolysis by urease, electro-oxidation, and sorbent systems. Among them, utilizing adsorption-based strategies for urea removal represents a promising approach in WAK design. This article reviews a variety of sorbent materials over last five years, encompassing both inorganic-based sorbents and organic-based sorbents. The inorganic-based sorbents include activated carbon, silica, zeolite, MXene, graphene/graphene oxide, and fullerene, while the organic-based sorbents contain chitosan, molecularly imprinted polymers, starch, celluloses, and metal organic frameworks. Furthermore, insightful perspectives on future research directions and development of urea sorbents for WAK are discussed.

TI Pt/N-rGO/Nb4N5 Electrocatalyst with Multilayered
   Structure and Ternary Synergy for Promoting Alcohol Oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Pt based catalysts with multi-component is widely used to improve the electrocatalytic ability in alcohol oxidation, however, it is still big challenge to maximize the synergies of different component. Herein, Pt/N-rGO/Nb4N5 composites with multilayered structure were prepared, with nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) layer covered on Nb4N5 sheet and Pt nanoparticles selective loaded on the interface of Nb4N5 and N-rGO. Furthermore, N-rGO was confirmed to act as the connector between Pt and Nb4N5, ascribed to the Nb4N5-N-rGO-Pt bridge via N-doping of graphene and partial oxidation of Pt. By comparison, Pt/N-rGO/Nb4N5-10 composite showed the best distribution of N-doped rGO in the gap between Pt nanoparticles and Nb4N5 sheet, as the ratio of urea and NbCl5 was 10. Accordingly, Pt/N-rGO/Nb4N5-10 electrode exhibited the optimal catalytic activity and durability for multiple alcohol oxide in acid, such as methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol, since maximum ternary synergy was achieved by the stable multilayered structure, involving the highest ESCAs due to more exposed active sites of Pt nanoparticles, the best electrical conductivity ascribed to the incorporation of N-rGO, and excellent CO tolerance because of the efficient activation of water on Nb4N5 and N-rGO.

TI The first report of deep eutectic solvent (DES) nano-photocatalyst
   (n-TiO2-P25@TDI@DES(urea:ZnCl2)) and its
   application on selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are prepared by mixing solid organic precursors to form a liquid driven from strong hydrogen-bond interactions. The physical and chemical properties of these compounds have been widely investigated, and it has been shown that they are benign media for biotransformations, organicsynthesis, biodieselpreparation, and a sustainable media for nanoscale and functional materials. RESULTS This study is the first report on the synthesis of n-TiO2-P25@TDI@DES (urea: ZnCl2) with photo catalytic activity. This nano photocatalyst was obtained through covalent grafting of TiO2-P25 nanoparticles to an inexpensive and highly reactive linker (2,4-toluene diisocyanate). The presented nano photocatalyst has been employed as a covalently grafted Lewis acidic deep eutectic solvent to oxidize various primary benzyl alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds by sodium nitrate as oxidant, under visible light exposure. CONCLUSION This highly efficient nanocatalyst was investigated by various characterization techniques including fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM with EDX), and elemental analysis. Owing to its enhanced catalytic activity, thermal stability, and environmentally friendly nature, the present method can be regarded as an attractive green chemistry approach.

TI Design of a dual-bed catalyst system with microporous carbons and
   urea-supported mesoporous carbons for highly effective removal of
   NOx at room temperature
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB A dual-bed catalyst system is designed to remove NOx at room temperature, which consists of a microporous spherical activated carbon (SAC) layer and a urea-supported spherical mesoporous carbon (SMC) layer. The SAC layer, with plenty of narrow micropores acting as a nano-cage for NO adsorption, could improve the oxidation of NO into NO2, while the urea-supported SMC layer with large surface area could provide a sufficient channel for gas kinetic diffusion and a high gas/urea interfacial area for efficient NO2 reduction. A high stationary-state NOx conversion of 88% for 70 h is achieved through the dual-bed catalyst system with SAC and 100 wt% urea supported SMC as the catalyst. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) activity could be improved by increasing the NO and O-2 feed concentration, due to the enhanced oxidation of NO to NO2. A low reaction temperature is beneficial for the SCR reaction because of the increased NO adsorption. Moreover, the apparent activation energies are calculated to be -16.8 kJ mol(-1) for NO oxidation and 1.18 kJ mol(-1) for NO2-urea SCR, respectively. The result reveals that the adsorption of reactants on SAC is of key importance for NO oxidation, while the surface reaction of NO2 with urea could be the crucial step for the SCR reaction.

TI Synthesis of phosphide on etched nickel foam as bifunctional
   electrocatalyst for urea-water electrolysis
SO IONICS
AB In this paper, firstly, nickel foam (NF) was etched in HF at different conditions. Then, Ni2P was synthesized on the etched NF (Ni2P/NF). The results indicate the concentration of HF, temperature, and etching time could affect the performance of NF, while the Ni2P synthesized on the best NF has better catalytic performance and can be used as a bifunctional catalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). For the anodic UOR, it can reach 1.42 V at 100 mA.cm(-2). While for the cathodic HER, the overpotential is 299 mV at 100 mA.cm(-2). Thus, that nickel phosphate on etched NF has good catalytic performance and can be used as a new catalyst for the electrolytic water-urea system.

TI A novel and effective oxidation-resistant approach in plasmonic MIM
   biosensors for real-time detection of urea and glucose in urine for
   monitoring diabetic and kidney disease severity
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this research article, we introduce a novel oxidation-resistant approach in a Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) plasmonic biosensor, specifically designed for the detection and diagnosis of diabetes and kidney disease severity using urea and glucose biomarkers in urine. The proposed biosensor features a four-hand-shaped fan resonator with integrated nanodots and stubs within its waveguide. We optimized its performance through Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, achieving a maximum sensitivity of 2470.48 nm/RIU and a Figure of Merit (FOM) of 50.15. To ensure chemical stability, we utilized an oxidation-resistant plasmonic material (Au) in our sensor, a critical factor for reliable biosensing applications. Additionally, we focus on Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD), a significant global health challenge, emphasizing the need for early detection and point-of-care treatment. By exploiting minute changes in resonant wavelength resulting from light-matter interactions through the properties of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) and MIM structures, our biosensor demonstrates promising capabilities for real-time and quantitative analysis of biomarkers critical for monitoring the stages of DKD.

TI Ni2P/NiCo2S4/NF nanocomposite as an
   anode catalyst for constructing urea fuel cells
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Ni-based catalysts have been considered as an efficient anode material for urea fuel cells due to their low cost and high activity in alkaline media. Ni2P/NiCo2S4 catalyst grown on nickel foam was synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis and solid phosphating. The cathode material Pt/C was prepared using the drop-coating method, which has good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. H-type urea/O-2 fuel cell was assembled and showed high energy density in alkaline solution at room temperature. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to characterize the Ni2P/NiCo2S4/NF catalyst. Results confirmed the formation of 3D flower-like microspheres from Ni2P/NiCo2S4/NF catalyst nanosheets. Electrochemical testing results indicated that the Ni2P/NiCo2S4/NF catalyst-decorated electrode can effectively promote urea oxidation and plays a leading role in improving the performance of fuel cells in 1 M KOH + 0.33 M urea. The H-type urea/O-2 fuel cell possesses a high power density of 0.42 mW cm(-2) at a cell potential of 0.45 V. To summarize, this study introduces a cheap but efficient electrode material as an anode catalyst for constructing urea fuel cells.

TI Development of high strength siloxane poly(urethane-urea) elastomers
   based on linked macrodiols for heart valve application
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB Mixed macrodiol based siloxane poly(urethane-urea)s (SiPUU) having number average molecular weights in the range 87-129 kDa/mol were synthesized to give elastomers with high tensile and tear strengths required to fabricate artificial heart valves. Polar functional groups were introduced into the soft segment to improve the poor segmental compatibility of siloxane polyurethanes. This was achieved by linking ,-bis(6-hydroxyethoxypropyl) poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) or poly(hexamethylene oxide) (PHMO) macrodiols with either 4,4-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) prior to polyurethane synthesis. The hard segment was composed of MDI, and a 1:1 mixture of 1,3-bis(4-hydroxybutyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane and 1,2-ethylene diamine. We report the effect of urethane linkers in soft segments on properties of the SiPUU. PHMO linked with either MDI or IPDI produced SiPUU with the highest tensile and tear strengths. Linking PDMS hardly affected the tensile strength; however, the tear strength was improved. The stress-strain curves showed no plastic deformation region typically observed for conventional polyurethanes indicating good creep resistance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Effects of urea-functionalized MoS2 on hydrophilic lubrication☆
SO TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB The challenge of achieving effective lubrication in polar lubricants like Water, Ethylene Glycol (EG), and Glycerol has driven the search for advanced lubricant additives. Traditional MoS2, while widely used in nonpolar lubricants, suffers from poor dispersion stability and inconsistent performance in polar solvents due to its hydrophobic nature. This study addresses those issues by functionalizing MoS2 with urea (U-MoS2) to improve its compatibility with polar lubricants. U-MoS2 was synthesized through a two-step process involving oxidation followed by urea functionalization. The results show that U-MoS2 significantly enhances dispersion stability, maintaining a uniform suspension for over 30 days. Rheological analysis revealed that U-MoS2 reduced the viscosity of Water, while in EG and Glycerol, it caused a slight increase in viscosity across the temperature range of 25 to 80 degrees C. Tribological experiments revealed a substantial reduction in the coefficient of friction (COF) for UMoS2-enhanced lubricants. In Water-based systems, the COF was reduced by 84 %, dropping to 0.057 with UMoS2. In EG and Glycerol-based systems, the COF reductions were 41 % and 38 %, respectively. Additionally, wear rate analysis demonstrated an 81 % reduction in wear for Water after introducing U-MoS2, a 51 % reduction for EG, and a 69 % reduction for Glycerol. Wear surface analysis first revealed the presence of a consistent MoS2 film on the contact surfaces, contributing to the observed reduction in wear and friction. These outcomes suggest that the urea molecule plays a key role in enhancing the adhesion of MoS2 to the substrate and facilitates the formation of a stable lubricating layer. By addressing the limitations of traditional MoS2 in polar solvents, this research aims to understand how polar functionalization can improve the performance of MoS2 in hydrophilic lubrication, potentially expanding its applications across various industrial sectors.

TI Controlled synthesis of Crx-FeCo2P
   nanoarrays on nickel foam for overall urea splitting
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Urea splitting is a highly promising technology for hydrogen production to cope with the fossil energy crisis, which requires the development of catalysts with high electrocatalytic activity. In this article, Cr-x-FeCo2P/NF catalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphorylation and used in the overall urea splitting process. Cr-0.15-FeCo2P/NF and Cr-0.1-FeCo2P/NF exhibited excellent urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity (potential of 1.355 V at 100 mA cm(-2)) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (overpotential of 173 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in 0.5 M urea solution containing 1 M KOH. In the assembled Cr-0.15-FeCo2P/NF//Cr-0.1-FeCo2P/NF electrolytic cell, only a small voltage of 1.50 V is needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that an appropriate amount of Cr doping accelerates the kinetic performance of hydrogen production as well as improving the metallic properties of the electrode.

TI Thiomonas sp CB2 is able to degrade urea and promote toxic metal
   precipitation in acid mine drainage waters supplemented with urea
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB The acid mine drainage (AMD) in Carnoules (France) is characterized by the presence of toxic metals such as arsenic. Several bacterial strains belonging to the Thiomonas genus, which were isolated from this AMD, are able to withstand these conditions. Their genomes carry several genomic islands (GEIs), which are known to be potentially advantageous in some particular ecological niches. This study focused on the role of the "urea island" present in the Thiomonas CB2 strain, which carry the genes involved in urea degradation processes. First, genomic comparisons showed that the genome of Thiomonas sp. CB2, which is able to degrade urea, contains a urea genomic island which is incomplete in the genome of other strains showing no urease activity. The urease activity of Thiomonas sp. CB2 enabled this bacterium to maintain a neutral pH in cell cultures in vitro and prevented the occurrence of cell death during the growth of the bacterium in a chemically defined medium. In AMD water supplemented with urea, the degradation of urea promotes iron, aluminum and arsenic precipitation. Our data show that ureC was expressed in situ, which suggests that the ability to degrade urea may be expressed in some Thiomonas strains in AMD, and that this urease activity may contribute to their survival in contaminated environments.

TI Facile synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene via low-temperature
   pyrolysis: The effects of precursors and annealing ambience on
   metal-free catalytic oxidation
SO CARBON
AB A green and facile protocol of thermal treatment of graphene oxide (GO) with urea was adopted to synthesize nitrogen-doped graphene (NG-Urea-air) at a low temperature (350 degrees C) in the static air. The resulting sample exhibited outstanding catalytic performance to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) toward organic degradation. The NG-Urea-air induced 49.7- and 11.5-fold enhancement over GO and pristine reduced graphene oxide (rGO-air). Moreover, the influences of nitrogen precursors including organic chemicals (urea, cyanamide, and melamine) and inorganic salts (ammonium nitrate and ammonium chloride) were investigated, and urea was demonstrated to be the best precursor for synthesizing N-doped graphene with a relative high doping level (18.7 at.%). The classical radical quenching and advanced in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technology revealed that the outstanding oxidative effectiveness of PMS/NG-Urea-air system was originated from the nonradical oxidation pathway, in which PMS was activated by the positively charged carbon domains next to nitrogen atoms and the phenol was oxidized simultaneously on the carbon network via rapid charge transfer. Meanwhile, singlet oxygen and radicals may also partially contribute to the complete phenol degradation. This study facilitates a fundamental investigation of heteroatom doping progress during thermal treatment and sheds light on the insights into carbocatalysis in environmental remediation.

TI Unexpected role of singlet oxygen generated in urea-modulated LaFeO3
   perovskite heterogeneous Fenton system in denitrification: Mechanism and
   theoretical calculations
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB This study appears an unprecedented phenomenon that 1O2, generated in urea-modulated LaFeO3 (U-LaFeO3) perovskite heterogeneous Fenton system, is superior to OH & BULL; and O2 & BULL;- in NO removal. The 2.5 U-LaFeO3/H2O2 system can remove 82.9% of NO, with a low H2O2/NO molar ratio (4.7) and high GHSV (30,800 h-1), along with good environmental adaptability and reusability. Urea modulation induced the formations of abundant La defects, O vacancies and Fe(IV), also improved the pore structure and surface area. The contribution order of different free radicals to NO removal is 1O2 > xO2 & BULL;- > & BULL;OH. Characterization combined with theoretical calculation clarify that (i) H2O2 is inclined to derive HO2 & BULL; on Fe sites; (ii) 1O2 is mainly generated from O2 & BULL;reaction with Fe(IV)/Fe(III); (iii) & BULL;OH is mainly produced by splitting of H2O2 on Fe site and decomposition of HO2 & BULL; on OV site. The main denitrification paths are NO+1O2 & RARR;NO2, NO2 + & BULL;OH & RARR;NO3- and NO+ & BULL;OH & RARR;NO2- .

TI Hybrid sonochemic urea-nitrate combustion preparation of
   CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst used in fuel cell-grade
   hydrogen production from methanol: Effect of sonication and fuel/nitrate
   ratio
SO PARTICULATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Fuel cell-grade hydrogen production has been studied via steam reforming of methanol (SRM) over a series of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalysts fabricated by the combustion method. The effect of sonication and urea/nitrate ratio on the characteristics and catalytic properties of the prepared catalysts has been investigated. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Particle Size Distribution (PSD), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and FTIR analyses XRD patterns showed positive influence of urea/nitrate ratio on CuO and ZnO crystallite sizes. The ultrasonic mixing of primary gel compared with conventional mixing led to lower crystallite size. FESEM images showed that the sample mixed by sonication with a urea/nitrate ratio of 1 had more homogeneous morphology with narrow particle size distribution. EDX results proved the presence of all metals on the surface of the nanocatalysts and better consistence between the gel and surface composition of elements in samples prepared by sonication. Catalytic performance showed that sonication during the mixing of primary gel dramatically increased the methanol conversion. It was also proved that increasing the amount of urea led to lower catalytic activity. The ultrasound- treated nanocatalyst with urea/nitrate =1 was the best sample in terms of activity and selectivity. It was stable in the SRM for 1200 min without considerable change in methanol conversion and product selectivity.

TI Designing bifunctional catalysts for urea electrolysis: progress and
   perspectives
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB Recently, urea electrolysis has become an attractive method for sustainable energy-saving hydrogen production and simultaneous pollutant degradation. To improve urea electrolysis efficiency and simplify electrolysis systems, developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts has attracted great interest. Recently, great achievements have been made in the design of high-performance bifunctional catalysts for urea electrolysis. In this review, the current progress in bifunctional catalysts for urea electrolysis is comprehensively analyzed. The fundamentals and catalyst design principles for urea electrolysis are first discussed. Then, the applications of advanced bifunctional catalysts in urea electrolysis are fully demonstrated, such as single atom catalysts (SACs), metal nanoparticles, alloys, metal (hydr)oxides, chalcogenides, pnictides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and composites. The structure-performance correlation of catalysts as well as their design strategies are emphasized. Current catalysts are also evaluated in terms of their catalytic activities, providing insights into the sensible design of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts. Several key perspectives are outlined to guide further studies on practical urea electrolysis-driven sustainable hydrogen production and urea-rich wastewater management.

TI Fabrication of CuO/TiO2/Ti Monolithic Catalyst for Efficient
   and Stable CO Oxidation
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB This work reports a novel strategy to in situ grow TiO2 nanosheets on flexible Ti mesh as ideal support, and to modify CuO active components through multi-step methods. The CuO/TiO2/Ti monolithic catalyst can realize the complete CO oxidation at 110 degrees C without the assistance of any noble metal and the outstanding long-term stability can be also achieved. When using urea as deposition precipitant, CuO particle size will increase obviously with the reaction time longer than 6 h, which is adverse to the catalytic performance, showing the significant impact of CuO particle size on the CO oxidation capability. The deposition reaction carried out in different solutions is also investigated and the results show that CuO/TiO2/Ti catalysts synthesized in acid and alkaline condition exhibit superior catalytic performance owing to the high content of Cu1+/0 and adsorbed oxygen species (O-alpha) on surface, large surface area, and excellent redox capacity compared with that in reductive solution. More importantly, the as-synthesized CuO/TiO2/Ti monolithic catalysts show outstanding low-temperature performance and excellent long-term stability, indicating the overwhelming advantage of in situ grown catalysts. It is expected that the peculiar in situ growth technology is capable of extending to monolithic catalysts for multiple applications in the future.

TI Coupled effect of substrate and light on assimilation and oxidation of
   regenerated nitrogen in the euphotic ocean
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Nitrogen (N), as a critical element for microbial metabolisms, recycles rapidly in the euphotic ocean. Oxidation by nitrifiers is a competing pathway for phytoplankton assimilation of regenerated N (NH4+ and urea). Sharing the overlapping substrates may result in competitive exclusion, thus, niche separation for the two assemblages. Both pathways are sensitive to light, but whether light intensity will intensify or alleviate such resource competition in the euphotic zone remains poorly explored in the field at the community level. By using N-15 labeling techniques, paired kinetic responses of uptake and oxidation were conducted in single bottles under manipulated light intensities for both NH4+ and urea. We found light stimulated the maximum rate (R-m) and specific affinities (alpha(U)) of both NH4+ and urea uptake. In contrast, light effects were opposite for oxidation kinetics (R-m and alpha(O)). As irradiance increased, the rapid increase in alpha(U) and concomitant decrease in alpha(O) imply a distinctive competition advantage of photosynthetic organisms over oxidizers under substrate-limited environments. The ratio of alpha(U)/alpha(O) for NH4+ ranged from 0.8 to 3089 (5.8-46,788 for urea) showing a distinct increasing pattern as ambient light increases, demonstrating that phytoplankton overwhelms nitrifiers throughout the oligotrophic euphotic zone, driving down concentrations and maintaining short turnover times of the two regenerated N substrates. Moreover, phytoplankton relied equally on NH4+ and urea; yet, nitrifiers preferred NH4+ to urea. In the nitrate-depleted euphotic ocean, light acts as a crucial driver for utilization pathways of regenerated N and vertical niche separation.

AB Monometallic gold and iridium, and bimetallic gold-iridium on ceria-niobia (Nb2O5-CeO2) catalysts were synthesized by deposition-precipitation with urea. Ceria-niobia support, synthesized by co-precipitation, presented a higher reducibility and a higher surface acidity as a consequence of the deposition of niobia on the ceria surface. The Au-Ir/CeNb showed an enhanced activity and stability during the carbon monoxide oxidation reaction as compared with the monometallic catalysts. These catalysts were thoroughly characterized chemical and structurally. High-resolution electron microscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy and CO adsorption showed evidences of iridium-gold closeness. In situ infrared spectroscopy in the diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) mode was used to investigate the reactivity of the active sites. A lower coverage of carbonate species was observed under reaction as a result of the presence of niobia in the catalyst formulation. Concentration-modulation excitation spectroscopy (c-MES) allowed a selective identification of intermediates and 'spectator' species. New adsorption sites for CO were identified and correlated with the high activity and stability of the bimetallic catalyst.

TI Outstanding synergistic effect of Au-Ir/Al2O3
   catalysts on the total oxidation of propane
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Bimetallic Au-Ir catalysts supported on gamma-Al2O3 were synthesized by a sequential deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) method. These materials displayed outstanding synergistic performance in the propane oxidation reaction at low reaction temperatures. A T-50 of 150 degrees C was obtained for a bimetallic Au-Ir catalyst (Au loading of 3 wt % and Ir loading of 5 wt %), while for their gold and iridium monometallic counterparts it was of 370 and 190 degrees C, respectively. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, HRTEM-HAADF, H-2-TPR, O-2-TPD, UV-vis, and pyridine thermo-desorption, followed by FTIR and XPS, showing distinct characteristics that were correlated with their catalytic activity. Outcomes revealed a strong interaction among the gold and iridium particles when the catalysts were activated in H-2 and that the thermal treatment atmosphere (hydrogen or air) modified the active sites; likewise, gold-iridium and monometallic iridium catalysts supported on gamma-Al2O3 showed considerable endurance to activity loss because they hardly presented metal sintering at high reaction temperatures. Moreover, XPS results revealed electron transfer between Au-Ir (Au-0 and Ir2+ species). Only the bimetallic system presented Lewis and Bronsted acidity (2.95 and 0.25 mu-mol m(-2), respectively), which may have been responsible for enhancing the total oxidation of C3H8 at a low temperature. Likewise, the 3Au-5Ir/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited high stability and reusability during five reaction cycles and using a GHSV of 41,000 h(-1).

TI Oxidation of Ammonia in Water Microdroplets Produces Nitrate and
   Molecular Hydrogen
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Water microdroplets containing dissolved ammonia (30-300 mu M) are sprayed through a copper oxide mesh with a 200 mu m average pore size, resulting in the formation of nitrate (NO3-) and the release of molecular hydrogen (H-2). The products result from a redox process that takes place at the liquid-solid interface through contact electrification, where no external potential is applied. Oxidation is initiated by superoxide radical anions (O-2(-)) that originate from the oxygen in the air surrounding the microdroplets and from the hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) originating from the water-air interface. Two spin traps (TEMPO and DMPO) capture these radicals as well as NH2OH+center dot, HNO, NO center dot, NO2 center dot, and NOOH, which are detected by mass spectrometry. We also directly observed N2O2-center dot by the same means. We found that the hydrogen atom from the ammonia molecule can be set free not only in the form of H-center dot but also as H-2, which is detected using a residue gas analyzer. The oxidation process can be significantly enhanced by a factor of 3 when the sprayed microdroplets are irradiated with ultraviolet light (265 nm, 5 W). 35% of 300 mu M ammonia can be degraded within 20 mu s, and the nitrate conversion rate is estimated to be 15 nmol<middle dot>mg(-1)<middle dot>h(-1).

TI Effect of controlled-release urea fertilizers for oilseed rape
   (Brassica napus L.) on soil carbon storage and CO2
   emission
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Fertilizer-induced CO2 emission is a primary driver of global warming. The experiment was used to study whether controlled-release urea (CRU) application in winter oilseed rape can play a positive role in mitigating CO2 emission and promoting C utilization by soil microorganisms. Five fertilizer types consisted of N0 (0 g N plant(-1)), conventional CRU application (CRU100%), monotypic CRU at the 80% of conventional rate (CRU80%), co-application of CRU with uncoated urea (CRC), and organic fertilizer (CRO). Results showed that soil CO2 fluxes were significantly affected by N fertilizer types after the start of the stem growing (P < 0.05). CO2 emissions typically peaked during the seed filling period, with the highest emission of 1.99 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) being registered for CRU100%. CRU100% had 25.00%, 30.60%, and 4.17% greater CO2 emissions than CRU80%, CRC, and CRO practices by harvest, respectively. Compared to the conventional CRU treatment, CRU80% led to a lower root volume and root mass ratio than CRU100%, which could partly contribute to the reduced CO2 emission. Conversely, CRU80% performed better in N agronomic efficiency than that of CRU100% treatment. Also, C source utilization by soil microbiomes as well as microbial diversity indices following CRU80% along with CRO applications was substantially higher than that under the conventional CRU supply. These observations suggest that opportunity exists to maintain N balance by N fertilization practices to mitigate CO2 emission from cropland. Further, a close and positive relationship between soil total nitrogen and CO2 emission also supports this. CRO-treated soils substantially elevated the contents of total carbon and readily oxidation carbon over CK. Moreover, the enzyme activity of beta-glucosidase in CRO soil was about twice as high as the CRU100%. Consequently, CRU amendments by decreasing CRU rate application and the incorporation of organic fertilizer into CRU have the potential for mitigating of CO2 emission and positive effect on the soil microbial functional diversity to improve nitrogen use efficiency of rapeseed.

AB NO and NO2 emissions over urea-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems were investigated in a nonroad diesel engine. For catalysts of the SCR systems, two types of metal ion-exchanged zeolites were used; one is Fe, the other Cu. The Fe/zeolite was composed of Fe only, however, the Cu/zeolite consisted of Cu (80%) and Fe (20%). Nitrogen oxides (NOx) conversion efficiency of the Fe/ and Cu/zeolite catalysts remained greater than 80% in the temperature range of approximately 300 and 450 degrees C. The Cu/zeolite catalyst retained high efficiency above approximately 450 degrees C, however, the Fe/zeolite exhibited a drastic decrease resulting from the deterioration of NO conversion efficiency due to the ammonia storage capability of Fe/zeolite, which was inferior to that of Cu/zeolite. It was also found that NO was oxidized to NO2 in the diesel oxidation catalyst and diesel particulate filter, and NO2/NOx ratio at the SCR inlet consistently maintained thermodynamic equilibrium irrespective of the SCR catalyst. The ratio was higher than 50% between 200 and 410 degrees C. N2O emission that forms in SCR systems through side reactions during NOx reduction was also studied because N2O is a greenhouse gas with approximately 300 times greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide. The ratio of N2O at the SCR outlet to NOx at the SCR inlet for both catalysts was higher between 200 and 410 degrees C than at other temperatures, which implies that N2O formation is considerably involved in the NO2/NOx ratio. The Cu/zeolite catalyst in the urea-SCR system exhibited higher NO and NO2 conversion efficiencies while maintaining a lower amount of N2O formation compared to the Fe/zeolite catalyst.

TI Built-in electrophilic/nucleophilic domain of nitrogen-doped carbon
   nanofiber-confined Ni2P/Ni3N nanoparticles for
   efficient urea-containing water-splitting reactions
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Transferring urea-containing waste water to clean hydrogen energy has received increasing attention, while challenges are still faced in the sluggish catalytic kinetics of urea oxidation. Herein, a novel hybrid catalyst of Ni2P/Ni3N embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber (Ni2P/Ni3N/NCNF) is developed for energy-relevant urea-containing water-splitting reactions. The built-in electrophilic/nucleophilic domain resulting from the electron transfer from Ni2P to Ni3N accelerates the formation of high-valent active Ni species and promotes favourable urea molecule adsorption. A spectral study and theoretical analysis reveal that the negatively shifted Ni d-band centre in Ni2P/Ni3N/NCNF weakens the adsorption of intermediate CO2 and facilitates its desorption, thereby improving the urea oxidation reaction kinetics. The overall reaction process is also optimized by minimizing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. Following the stability test, the surface reconstruction of the pre-catalyst is discussed, where an amorphous layer of NiOOH as the real active phase is formed on the surface/interface of Ni2P/Ni3N for urea oxidation. Benefiting from these characteristics, a high current density of 151.11 mA cm(-2) at 1.54 V vs. RHE is obtained for urea oxidation catalysed by Ni2P/Ni3N/NCNF, exceeding that of most of the similar catalysts. A low cell voltage of 1.39 V is required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for urea electrolysis, which is about 200 mV less than that of the general water electrolysis. The current work will be helpful for the development of advanced catalysts and their application in the urea-containing waste water transfer to clean hydrogen energy.

TI Microbial oxidation of nitrogen supplied as selected organic nitrogen
   compounds in the South Atlantic Bight
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) can account for a large fraction of the dissolved nitrogen (N) pool in the ocean, but the cycling of marine DON is poorly understood. Recent discoveries that urea- and cyanate-N can be oxidized by some strains of Thaumarchaeota suggest that these abundant microbes may be able to access and oxidize a fraction of the DON pool. However, measurements of the oxidation of N supplied as DON compounds are scarce. Here, we compare oxidation rates of N supplied as a variety of DON compounds in samples from Georgia coastal waters, where nitrifier communities are numerically dominated by Thaumarchaeota. Our data indicate that polyamine-N is particularly amenable to oxidation compared to the other DON compounds tested. Oxidation of N supplied as putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) was generally higher than that of N supplied as glutamate, arginine, or urea, and was consistently 5-10% of the ammonia oxidation rate. Our data also suggest that the oxidation rate of polyamine-N may increase as the length of the carbon skeleton increases. Oxidation of N supplied as putrescine, urea, and glutamate were all highest near the coast and lower further offshore, consistent with patterns of ammonia oxidation in these waters. Though it is unclear whether oxidation of polyamine-N reflects direct oxidation by Thaumarchaeota or combines remineralization and subsequent ammonia oxidation, more rapid oxidation of N from putrescine compared to amino acids or urea suggests that polyamine-N may contribute significantly to nitrification in the ocean.

TI All-organic covalent organic frameworks/perylene diimide urea polymer
   S-scheme photocatalyst for boosted H2 generation
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB Conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution owing to their high crystallinity, large surface area, and distinct structure. However, COFs exhibit poor charge separation. Therefore, investigating highly effective COF-based photocatalysts is crucial. For the first time, conjugated COF/perylene diimide urea polymer (PUP) all-organic hetero-structure with S-scheme interfacial charge-transfer channels was successfully developed and man-ufactured via in situ coupling of the two-dimensional triazine-based imine-linked COF (denoted as TATF-COF) with PUP. The optimal photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution rate of 94.5 mmol h-1 g-1 for TATF-COF/PUP is 3.5 times that of pure TATF-COF and is comparable to or even higher than that of the previously reported COF-based photocatalysts, resulting in an apparent quantum efficiency of up to 19.7% at 420 nm. The improved directional S-scheme charge transfer driven by the tuned built-in electric field and enhanced oxidation and reduction reaction rates of the photogenerated carriers contribute synergistically to the boosted photocatalytic H2 evolution. Experiments and theoretical studies reveal plausible H2 evolution and spatial S-scheme charge-separation mechanisms under visible-light irradiation. This study provides advanced methods for constructing all-organic S-scheme high-efficiency photocatalysts by the modulation of band structures.

TI Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol at Ambient
   Conditions using Spray-Dried
   g-C3N4/TiO2 Granules
SO MOLECULAR CATALYSIS
AB In the 2010-decade, significant progresses have been made in the photocatalytic properties of graphitic-carbon nitride (g-C3N4). In this study, we synthesized and characterized a new photocatalyst, spray-dried g-C3N4/TiO2 granules, through a simple pyrolysis process of urea and TiCl4 as the precursors. The photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAL) was carried out in a batch reactor in the presence of pure g-C3N4, gC(3)N(4)/TiO2, and spray-dried g-C3N4/TiO2 granules at ambient pressure and under visible light irradiation at different conditions, including reaction time, temperature, and catalyst loading. The results showed that the new photocatalyst, spray-dried g-C3N4/TiO2 granules (TCNg), is much more effective on the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and also possesses high atom efficiency, high yield, and an average turnover frequency (TOF) of over 550 h(-1). Finally, the DFTB + method was used to investigate the frontier orbitals and to determine the band gap of TiO2, g-C3N4, and g-C3N4/TiO2.

TI Total oxidation of benzene over cobalt-aluminum mixed oxides prepared
   from layered double hydroxides: influence of preparation methods
SO REACTION KINETICS MECHANISMS AND CATALYSIS
AB The influence of the preparation methods of Co-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) on the structural and catalytic properties of Co-Al mixed oxides for benzene total oxidation was investigated. Various Co-Al LDHs were synthesized via constant pH precipitation, decreasing pH precipitation, and urea homogeneous precipitation. The synthesized samples were characterized by using N-2 physical adsorption, ICP, XRD, TG-DTA, SEM, and H-2-TPR. The characterization results showed that calcination of Co-Al LDHs gave rise to Co-Al mixed oxides consisting of Co(Co, Al)(2)O-4 spinel as the main phase, which showed relatively small crystallite size and high specific surface area, i.e., similar to 12 nm, 90-100 m(2) g (cat) (-1) . The highest catalytic activity was obtained on the Co-Al mixed oxide prepared by decreasing pH precipitation, followed by that prepared by constant pH precipitation, while the Co-Al mixed oxide prepared by urea homogeneous precipitation was much less active. The activity difference can be related to the different reducibility of Co3+ species in Co(Co, Al)(2)O-4 spinel.

TI Morphology and surface properties of high strength siloxane
   poly(urethane-urea)s developed for heart valve application
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
AB A series of siloxane poly(urethane-urea) (SiPUU) were developed by incorporating a macrodiol linked with a diisocyanate to enhance mixing of hard and soft segments (SS). The effect of this modification on morphology, surface properties, surface elemental composition, and creep resistance was investigated. The linked macrodiol was prepared by reacting alpha,omega-bis(6-hydroxyethoxypropyl) poly(dimethylsiloxane)(PDMS) or poly(hexamethylene oxide) (PHMO) with either 4,4 '-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). SiPUU with PHMO-MDI-PHMO and PHMO-IPDI-PHMO linked macrodiols showed enhanced creep resistance and recovery when compared with a commercial biostable polyurethane, Elast-Eon (TM) 2A. Small and wide-angle X-ray scattering data were consistent with significant increase of hydrogen bonding between hard and SS with linked-macrodiols, which improved SiPUU's tensile stress and tear strengths. These SiPUU were hydrophobic with contact angle higher than 101 degrees and they had low water uptake (0.7%center dot w/w of dry mass). They also had much higher siloxane concentration on the surface compared to that in the bulk. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 107B: 112-121, 2019.

SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based catalysts are gaining attention due to their tunable properties. In this study, we synthesized MOF based Ni and Co doped iron selenide (NiCoFeSe) hexagonal nanorods electrocatalyst. This NiCoFeSe catalyst exhibited outstanding performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with impressively low overpotentials of 220, 275 mV for HER, 230, 330 mV for OER, and 210, 300 mV for UOR at current densities of 50 and 100 mAcm(-2), respectively. Additionally, we fabricate a wireless flexible and rigid photovoltaic-electrochemical device utilizing NiCoFeSe as both the anode and cathode, achieving an impressive solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 11.1%. Furthermore, we developed an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with NiCoFeSe as anode and cathode, achieving a current density of 1.07 Acm (-2) at 1.85 V, along with a cell efficiency of 69.67% and an energy consumption of 47.85 kWh to produce 1 kg of hydrogen.

TI Electrocatalytic Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Production over a Bifunctional
   Cobalt Hydrogen Phosphite Catalyst
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Urea-assisted water electrolysis offers an effective strategy to significantly lower the cell voltage required for hydrogen production, while the development of efficient and earth-abundant bifunctional electrocatalysts has attracted considerable attention. Here, we present crystalline cobalt hydrogen phosphite as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, facilitating both cathodic hydrogen production and anodic urea oxidation. Surface reconstruction is demonstrated, leading to the formation of oxyhydroxides, which act as active sites for electrocatalysis. Notably, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm-2 requires ultralow potentials of -59 mV for the cathodic reaction and 1.302 V for the anodic reaction. Additionally, an overall cell voltage of 1.376 V is achieved to sustain the same current density in a two-electrode hybrid water electrolysis system, which is considerably lower than that required for traditional water splitting (1.577 V). This newly developed bifunctional electrocatalyst shows great promise for future energy-saving hydrogen production and urea-related wastewater treatment applications.

AB Soil type influences the effectiveness of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers in reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, although the effect has not been well studied. We measured N2O, NO and methane (CH4) fluxes after the application of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers and conventional fertilizer (urea) in two contrasting soils, an Andosol and a Fluvisol, in lysimeter fields. Brassica rapa var. perviridis L.H.Bailey (komatsuna) was cultivated for 1.5months in spring and in autumn. A nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), and polymer coated urea (CU) were tested in the spring and autumn experiments, respectively. In spring, DCD was effective in reducing N2O and NO emissions in the Andosol but not in the Fluvisol, compared with urea. Nitrification was likely to be a more important production process for N2O and NO in the Andosol than in the Fluvisol. This difference in N2O and NO production processes was inferred to be the main reason why DCD effectively reduced N2O and NO emissions only in the Andosol. Yield-scaled N2O emission for DCD was lower by 63% than for urea in the Andosol, but no difference was observed in the Fluvisol. In autumn in the Andosol, CU increased N2O emission compared with urea, but no difference was observed for NO emissions. In the Fluvisol, CU was not effective in reducing N2O and NO emissions. CH4 uptake from the Andosol was significantly higher than that from the Fluvisol. Fertilizer type had no effect on cumulative CH4 uptake in either soil. Our results showed that the effectiveness of DCD and CU in reducing N2O and NO emissions varied with soil because the main production processes of these gases varied with soil.

TI Tailoring the density of states of Ni(OH)2 with
   Ni<SUP>0</SUP> towards solar urea wastewater splitting
SO NANOSCALE
AB Solar urea wastewater splitting is capable of producing hydrogen and degrading the urea pollutant simultaneously. Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) has been recognized as an effective cocatalyst for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). But the lack of an efficient preparation method and a suitable Ni(OH)(2) based cocatalyst limits the performances of solar urea wastewater splitting. Herein, a potential-cycling method is developed with a high-purity nickel plate serving as the counter electrode and nickel source in a three-electrode configuration. Spherical Ni-0-doped Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles are successfully synthesized on the surface of TiO2 nanorod arrays. The photocurrent density of TiO2/Ni-0:Ni(OH)(2) can reach 0.56 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE in 1 M NaOH and 0.33 M CO(NH2)(2) mixed electrolyte under AM1.5G illumination, which is 1.75 and 1.93 times those of TiO2/Ni(OH)(2) deposited using a normal potentiostatic method with nickel salt solution and pristine TiO2, respectively. Ni-0 doping can significantly decrease the charge transfer resistance and provide a more favorable distribution of density of states of Ni(OH)(2) for the UOR. Furthermore, Ni-0:Ni(OH)(2) decorated TiO2 photoanodes exhibit good photocurrent retention during 12 h continuous testing. This work expands the preparation technique of urea catalysts and the strategy for developing highly efficient nickel-based catalysts.

TI Enhanced Basicity of MnOx-Supported Ru for the Selective Oxidation of

SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB The present study focused on developing a stable basic MnOx support for Ru (RuMn) for the efficient oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in water in the absence of an external base. A series of MnOx supports, synthesized via hydrothermal approach using urea as precipitant, was prepared by thermal treatment at various temperatures (300-800 degrees C) before doping with Ru. The RuMn-2 (1 wt % Ru, MnOx calcined at 400 degrees C) possessed a large number of basic sites (1.72 mmol g(-1)) based on CO2 temperature-programmed desorption analysis, affording an FDCA yield of 87 % with a turnover frequency of 22 h(-1). Transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping of RuMn-2 showed a high dispersion of Ru over the surface of MnOx, contributing to the efficient HMF oxidation. Moreover, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and H-2 temperature-programmed reduction indicated that the predominant MnO2 phase (epsilon-MnO2) played a vital role in HMF oxidation.

TI Co3Mo3N nanosheets arrays on nickel foam as highly
   efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall urea electrolysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Replacing dynamics-restricted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with smart urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is very important for reducing the power consumption for hydrogen production. Here, the Co3Mo3N-400/NF is prepared using a facial way, which exhibits remarkable catalytic performances for UOR, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overall urea electrolysis (OUE) because of the more exposed active sites and high electrical conductivity. At 100 mA/cm(2), the Co3Mo3N-400/NF shows a small potential of 1.356 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) for UOR, which is much lower than that for OER. Furthermore, for HER, to reach to 100 mA/cm(2), a low overpotential of 299 mV is required, and the urea has negligible influence on the HER process. For OUE, the Co3Mo3N-400/NF||Co3Mo3N-400/NF shows a small cell potential of 1.481 V at 100 mA/cm(2) along with a good durability. Our work provides more choice for future OUE to generate hydrogen.& nbsp;(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI In situ grown high-valence Mo-doped NiCo Prussian blue analogue
   for enhanced urea electrooxidation
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Mo-doped NiCo Prussian blue analogue (PBA) electrocatalysts self-supported on Ni foam are elaborately designed, which exhibit a low potential of 1.358 V (vs. RHE) to reach 100 mA cm(-2) for catalyzing the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The incorporation of high-valence Mo (+6) modifies the electronic structure and improves the electron transfer ability. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, we confirm the effect of Mo doping on the NiCo PBA electronic structure.

TI Heterojunction-Induced Local Charge Redistribution Boosting
   Energy-Saving Hydrogen Production via Urea Electrolysis
SO ACS MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Substituting the oxygen evolution reaction by the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is thermodynamically more favorable for energy-saving hydrogen production. However, UOR suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics due to its complex six-electron transfer processes combined with conversion of complicated intermediates. Herein, LaNiO3-NiO heterojunctions successfully constructed to accelerate UOR. Systematic experimental investigation and theoretical calculation endorse that self-driven local charge redistribution takes place at the Janus LaNiO3/NiO interface, generating local nucleophilic and electrophilic regions. Such a unique structure is favorable for targeted adsorption of amino groups and electrophilic carbonyl groups, thus promoting the rupture of C-N bonds in urea. In addition, the build-in electric field triggered by LaNiO3-NiO heterojunction could effectively diminish the stepwise energy barrier, accelerating desorption of *CO2. As a result, the LaNiO3-NiO exhibits superior UOR performance, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.34 V (vs RHE). This work supplies valuable insights for fundamental understanding and rational construction of efficient heterojunction UOR catalyst.

TI The controlled synthesis of nitrogen and iron co-doped
   Ni3S2@NiP2 heterostructures for the
   oxygen evolution reaction and urea oxidation reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB At present, global resources are nearly exhausted and environmental pollution is becoming more and more serious, so it is urgent to develop efficient catalysts for hydrogen production. Herein, nitrogen and iron co-doped Ni3S2 and NiP2 heterostructures with high efficiency oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performances were firstly successfully prepared on nickel foam by hydrothermal and high-temperature calcination methods. Benefiting from the hierarchical structure, the exposure of more active sites and the doping effect of N and Fe, the N-Fe-Ni3S2@NiP2/NF material showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER and UOR. The N-Fe-Ni3S2@NiP2/NF material displays excellent catalytic OER performance; the overpotential is only 251 mV to drive 100 mA cm(-2) current density, while for the UOR, the potential is only 1.353 V to drive 100 mA cm(-2) current density, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. It is worth noting that scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface of N-Fe-Ni3S2@NiP2/NF is rough and has some mesopores, which may have resulted in an increase of active sites during the electrocatalytic process. The N-Fe-Ni3S2@NiP2/NF electrode couple also has relatively long-term durability in alkaline solutions, maintaining a stable current density for 15 h at 1.35 V. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the in situ generated Fe doped nanooxides exhibit strong water adsorption energy, which may be one of the reasons for the good catalytic activity. Our work is conducive to the rational design of electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production from water splitting and wastewater treatment.

TI Ultra-stable electrocatalysts for overall urea degradation by NiFeCoZn-S
   modified N-doped carbon
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Urea degradation is a viable method to produce hydrogen in a sustainable way, while having an important place in environmental protection and energy security. In this work, ultrathin N-doped carbon (NC) nanosheets, modified by ultrafine multiple transition metal sulfide (NiFeCoZn-S) nanoparticles, are synthesized to serve as electrocatalysts for overall urea degradation. This unique structure allows NiFeCoZn-S/NC to have a relatively large ECSA and active sites, stemming from the small dimensions of the NiFeCoZn-S particles and the hierarchical nanoarchitecture of the NC. Thus, NiFeCoZn-S/NC has a significant urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity of 1.31 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in an electrolyte consisting of 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea. Furthermore, when the catalyst was used in an electrolytic cell for urea degradation, a potential of 1.49 V was achieved up to 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the catalyst exhibits only a 6.1 % performance decay after 660 h of operation at 10 mA cm(-2). Its exceptional stability outshines that of existing urea catalysts, rendering it an attractive prospect for future applications.

TI Low-temperature thermocatalytic particulate carbon decomposition via
   urea solution-combustion derived CeO2 nanostructures
SO JOURNAL OF RARE EARTHS
AB A facile, one-pot, urea solution combustion route was utilized to synthesize highly catalytic CeO2 nanostructures. CeO2 prepared under varying thermal conditions was characterized by electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared and Raman techniques. As the synthesis temperature is raised from 400 to 1000 degrees C, the crystallite size and dspacing of nanoparticles are observed to reduce while cell parameters remain in the same range. Particle size exhibits an accession from-20 to-50 nm along the process. Initial CeO2 nanoparticles are detected as a composite structure of CeO2 and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) produced by the pyrolysis of urea. Concerning the solid carbon particulate oxidation capacity, an outstanding performance is exhibited by CeO2 synthesized at 800 degrees C where the oxidation onset temperature is reduced by 27% compared with the others. The superior performance is attributed to the carbon nitride-generated unique CeO2 nanomorphology consolidating ample reactive sites and facilitated oxygen delivery for a highly efficient thermocatalytic process. Concerning atmospheric pollution mitigation, synthesis of these CeO2 nanostructures represents a cost effective and convenient abatement technique for carbon particulates in comparison to cost-intensive, environmentally detrimental and noble-metal based techniques.

SO JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY

Simultaneously, the batch experiments were carried out to investigate the adsorption of U(VI) onto the m-a-NC materials. The m-a-NC materials exhibit the maximum adsorption capacity of 397 mg/g towards U(VI) at 298.15 K and pH = 4.5. The adsorption kinetics was well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption isotherm was better described by the Langmuir model. The possible adsorption mechanism of the m-a-NC for U(VI) was ion-exchange and coordination.

TI Co-doped Ni-Mo oxides: highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts for
   urea electrooxidation assisted hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Electrolysis systems constructed by anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have received considerable attention in sustainable energy and waste utilization. However, current electrolysis systems are far from the requirement of practical applications due to the limited catalytic activity and stability of the electrodes. Herein, we design a UOR electrode with Co-doped NiMoO4 treated in Ar (NCMO-Ar), which shows superior UOR performance because of the Co doping. On the other hand, the Co-doped NiMoO4 treated in H-2 (NCMO-H-2) delivers high activity for HER. Moreover, the use of a flow electrolysis cell is demonstrated with continuous injection of urea, which only requires a low operation potential of 1.342 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and shows no attenuation at a large operation current of 100 mA cm(-2) for 200 h. It is believed that this high-performance electrolysis system lays an important foundation in developing a practical electrolyzer for efficient and sustainable hydrogen production coupled with waste organic oxidation.

TI Elimination of the antibiotic norfloxacin in municipal wastewater, urine
   and seawater by electrochemical oxidation on IrO2 anodes
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The electrochemical degradation of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic norfloxacin (NOR) on Ti/IrO2 anodes, in several aqueous matrices was evaluated. For this purpose, initially the performance and degradation routes of the technology at several pH values (3.0, 6.5, 7.5 and 9.0) and in the presence of some of the most common anions in real water matrices (Cl-, HCO3-, SO42- and NO3-) were determined. The results showed that the degradation of NOR can occur through both direct elimination at the electrode surface and mediated oxidation, via the electrogeneration of oxidative agents, such as active chlorine species and percarbonate ions, which come from chloride and bicarbonate oxidation, respectively. Conversely, nitrate ions showed to inhibit the efficiency of the system. Concerning the pH, the efficiency of the process in the presence of chloride ions followed the order: 9.0 > 7.5 > 6.5 > 3.0; showing a strong dependence of the NOR speciation, and being the anionic form of the antibiotic the more susceptible to be oxidized. Furthermore, the identification of three primary NOR by-products demonstrated that the initial attack of the active chlorine species, mainly HOCl, occurred at the secondary amine of the piperazine ring followed by chlorination of the benzene ring. The precedent findings were crucial to understand the efficiency of the technology to eliminate NOR in synthetic complex matrices such as seawater, municipal wastewater and urine. The electrochemical oxidation showed to be promissory to eliminate NOR, and its associated antimicrobial activity, in such complexes matrices. Waters at basic pH containing chloride or bicarbonate ions, such as seawater or municipal wastewater showed to be the most adapted to the application of the technology. Additionally, nitrate ions or urea, found in some matrices like fresh urine, reduce the efficiency of the process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The influence of Ce doping on catalytic oxidation of toluene over
   Co3O4/iron mesh monolithic catalyst
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB In this paper, CeCoOx/iron mesh monolithic catalyst (CeCoOx/IM) was successfully prepared by hydrothermal method. The preparation conditions such as Ce/Co ratio, hydrothermal temperature as well as nitrate/urea ratio of the catalysts were optimized systematically. The catalytic performance results showed that when the Ce/Co ratio was 0.4, hydrothermal temperature was 160 degrees C and nitrate/urea ration was 1:8, the obtained catalyst possessed the best toluene oxidation activity, and the temperature at 50% and 90% toluene conversion (T-50% and T-90%) was 248 degrees C and 256 degrees C, respectively, which was lower than that of Co3O4/IM (260 degrees C and 267 degrees C, respectively). In addition, the active component is closely combined with the iron substrate with an exfoliation rate of 0.07%. H-2-TPR results showed that the existence of rich Co3+ species and the strong interaction between Co and Ce was one of the reasons for this improvement performance. The introduction of Ce can also improve the thermal stability, water resistance and cycling stability of the catalyst. The reaction kinetics analysis showed that the Ea value was significantly reduced by Ce doping, which reached to 71.3 kJ.mol(-1) for the best performance catalyst. We hope this study can provide a theoretical support for the practical application of catalyst.

TI Anaerobic Sulfur Oxidation Underlies Adaptation of a Chemosynthetic
   Symbiont to Oxic-Anoxic Interfaces
SO MSYSTEMS
AB Chemosynthetic symbioses occur worldwide in marine habitats, but comprehensive physiological studies of chemoautotrophic bacteria thriving on animals are scarce. Stilbonematinae are coated by thiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. As these nematodes migrate through the redox zone, their ectosymbionts experience varying oxygen concentrations. However, nothing is known about how these variations affect their physiology. Here, by applying omics, Raman microspectroscopy, and stable isotope labeling, we investigated the effect of oxygen on "Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti." Unexpectedly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated in anoxic relative to oxic conditions, but carbon fixation genes and incorporation of C-13-labeled bicarbonate were not. Instead, several genes involved in carbon fixation were upregulated under oxic conditions, together with genes involved in organic carbon assimilation, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and urea utilization. Furthermore, in the presence of oxygen, stress-related genes were upregulated together with vitamin biosynthesis genes likely necessary to withstand oxidative stress, and the symbiont appeared to proliferate less. Based on its physiological response to oxygen, we propose that "Ca. T. oneisti" may exploit anaerobic sulfur oxidation coupled to denitrification to proliferate in anoxic sand. However, the ectosymbiont would still profit from the oxygen available in superficial sand, as the energy-efficient aerobic respiration would facilitate carbon and nitrogen assimilation.
   IMPORTANCE Chemoautotrophic endosymbionts are famous for exploiting sulfur oxidization to feed marine organisms with fixed carbon. However, the physiology of thiotrophic bacteria thriving on the surface of animals (ectosymbionts) is less understood. One longstanding hypothesis posits that attachment to animals that migrate between reduced and oxic environments would boost sulfur oxidation, as the ectosymbionts would alternatively access sulfide and oxygen, the most favorable electron acceptor. Here, we investigated the effect of oxygen on the physiology of "Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti," a gammaproteobacterium which lives attached to marine nematodes inhabiting shallow water sand. Surprisingly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated under anoxic relative to oxic conditions. Furthermore, under anoxia, the ectosymbiont appeared to be less stressed and to proliferate more. We propose that animal-mediated access to oxygen, rather than enhancing sulfur oxidation, would facilitate assimilation of carbon and nitrogen by the ectosymbiont.

TI Solvent-free multi-alkylation of urea with alcohols catalyzed by
   titania-supported iridium catalyst with a strong metal-support
   interaction
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB One of the primary responsibilities of chemists is the development of environmentally friendly and economically efficient catalytic systems to minimize pollution and reduce energy and raw material consumption. Here we report the titania-supported iridium-catalyzed multi-alkylation of urea by various alcohols under solvent-free conditions, where strong metal-support interaction plays a dominant role in catalyst activity. Experiments revealed that titania supports significantly affect the catalysis. Compared with the iridium catalyst supported on rutile, anatase-supported ones were more active in N-alkylation, resulting in higher yields of the desired prod-ucts. By increasing the loading of iridium on titania support, the activity of the catalyst was effectively promoted. The hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectra showed that the amount of iridium loading significantly affected the reduction behavior and valence state of iridium, indicating the sig-nificant effects of the strong metal-support interaction on the activity of the catalyst. The catalyst could be used at least five times without significant inactivation.

AB NiO/TiO2 sub-microrods have been synthesized via a simple two-step route. First, the precursors were prepared by a facile ethylene glycol-mediated method; then, NiO/TiO2 sub-microrods were obtained by a limited-oxygen atmosphere deriving from the decomposition of urea at 450 degrees C for 3 h in air. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The obtained NiO/TiO2 submicrorods exhibit cubic NiO structure with high crystallinity and anatase TiO2. Both SEM and TEM show the typical sub-microrods with lengths of similar to 380 nm and diameters of similar to 180 nm. The uniform sub-microrods have great electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation reaction in alkaline solution. This material may have potential applications in direct methanol fuel cells.

TI Liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde over chromium
   borophosphate catalyst synthesized by solution combustion method using
   different types of fuel
SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB In this paper, chromium borophosphates have been prepared by the solution combustion method using different types of fuel and enhanced as a catalyst for liquid-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde for the first time. Carbohydrazide, citric acid, hexamethylenetetramine, oxalyldihydrazide and urea used as an organic fuel and the obtained chromium borophosphates were systematically characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and surface analysis techniques. They are structurally identical and thermally stable up to 1000 degrees C. According to fuel, their surface properties differ from each other and the long and short rod-like particles, which have a surface area between 7 and 19 m(2) g(-1), are formed. The effects of solvent type, reaction temperature, reaction time, peroxide amount and catalyst amount were also examined for catalytic studies, and the reaction conditions were optimized. As compared with the other fuels, hexamethylenetetramine-assisted synthesized chromium borophosphate catalyst provides high benzaldehyde conversion (52.09%) and selectivity (100%) under the optimized condition and has potential as a heterogeneous catalyst for oxidation reactions.

TI Advanced oxidation protein products in nondiabetic end stage renal
   disease patients on maintenance haemodialysis
SO FREE RADICAL RESEARCH
AB In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the impairment of the excretory function leads to elevation in the blood concentrations of urea, creatinine, and various protein metabolic products. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), along with protein carbonyls, protein-bound di-tyrosines and S-thiolated proteins, are considered biomarkers of oxidative stress in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on maintenance haemodialysis (HD). In this study, we evaluated the correlations between plasma levels of AOPP (measured by size exclusion/gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography) and those of protein-bound di-tyrosines, protein carbonyls, albumin and fibrinogen in 50 nondiabetic ESRD patients on maintenance HD. Considering that AOPP could represent the bridge between oxidative stress and inflammation, having been identified as proinflammatory mediators, we also evaluated the association between AOPP levels, C-reactive protein concentration and white blood cells count. Finally, we assessed the associations between plasma level of AOPP and serum concentrations of creatinine and urea, both of which showed a strong dependence on the chronological age of haemodialysed patients. Taken together, our results confirm the robust relationship between uraemia and oxidative stress, especially when measured as biomarkers of severe protein oxidative damage (e.g. plasma AOPP).

TI NOx removal in a rotating packed bed: Oxidation and enhanced
   absorption process optimization
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In view of the continuously stringent standard of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, developing new technologies for NOx removal or updating the existing NOx removal system is very urgent. This work introduces a novel technology for NOx removal in an RPB reactor by the combination of oxidation and enhanced absorption. Experimental results show that a rotating packed bed (RPB) reactor, having high gas-liquid mass transfer efficiency, is a more appropriate choice for NOx removal. Then a series system combining firstly a stirred tank reactor (STR) and secondly an RPB reactor, has been developed in order to oxidize more NO to NO2 that is very soluble and enhances the subsequent absorption in the RPB reactor. The higher oxidation degree (similar to 99%) was achieved with a sodium chlorite concentration of 0.10 mol L-1 and a liquid volume of 5.0 L in the STR. An absorbent containing sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPcS) was employed in the RPB reactor to meet the demand of very efficient denitrification for a long-term running. Compared to the traditional urea/sodium chlorite composite absorbent in a single RPB system, the total NOx removal efficiency increased by approximately 30% through the absorbent containing CoPcS in a series system under the optimized conditions.

TI Mass loss and evolved gas analysis in thermal decomposition of solid
   urea
SO FUEL
AB The effect of different oxygen concentration and heating rates on the mass loss and the formation of gaseous products (NH3, N2O and CO) during the thermolysis process of solid urea was studied and discussed by experiments, and the production mechanism of N2O and CO was also explored and proposed. Experimental results show that there were four major stages of mass loss in each TGA curve and two sharp endothermic peaks in each DSC curve, and the peaks reflected urea melting and its decomposition. Little NH3 was found in the exhaust gas at temperatures prior to 140 C-omicron, confirming that little urea decomposed before the melting point, but above that the NH3 production dramatically increased. The presence of O-2 lowered the highest NH3 yield, possibly resulting from the oxidation of partial generated NH3. At the same experimental condition, the N2O production was approximately twice the CO production, but O-2 accelerated the formation of both of them, and more O-2 promoted more formation. The higher heating rate resulted in the less reaction time for urea thermolysis. Therefore, it not only led to the thermolysis process moving to the high temperature zone, but also brought about higher gaseous products concentration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Arabinose oxidation in a fixed bed of extrudates and solid foams
   containing gold nanoparticles
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Oxidation of arabinose was investigated in a tandem reactor system comprising a fixed bed of gold catalysts supported on extrudates or solid foams and a stirred tank allowing operation under constant pH of 8. Powder catalyst containing 3 wt% Au deposited on gamma-alumina was extruded with gamma-alumina and attapulgite or sepiolite as a binder or deposited on the solid open-cell aluminum foam after anodic oxidation pretreatment. Alternatively, deposition precipitation of gold with urea from HAuCl4 precursor was done directly on the extruded support or the solid foam. The presence of gold was essential for catalytic activity which in the applied reactor set-up was strongly limited by mass transfer. Arabinose was rather selectively (ca. 90-95% at full conversion) oxidized to arabinonic acid giving besides arabinolactone other by-products. A mathematical model was developed for the open foam catalyst structures and the extrudates, comprising intrinsic kinetics deduced from batch experiments and the mass transfer within the solid catalyst.

TI Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction: potential cornerstones for
   new green nitrogen economy
SO SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS
AB A sustainable nitrogen fixation industrial chain centered around nitrate has been proposed in recent years, incorporating advanced techniques such as electro/photo-catalytic nitrate reduction for ammonia and the co-reduction of nitrate and CO2 for urea production. However, nitrate production heavily relies on energy-intensive processes, which necessitate high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, leading to significant energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. So, electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation is receiving increasing attention as a novel pathway for nitric acid production. Herein, we summarize the recent developments of N2 oxidation reactions with a focus on their design, mechanism, and catalytic kinetics regulation. Based on the results discussed, we briefly present the current challenges and propose several future opportunities.

TI Polymer-Coated Urea Application Could Produce More Grain Yield in
   "Super" Rice
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
AB Extensive economic reforms have resulted in a significant decrease in the involvement of rural labor force in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production in China. One of the most effective ways in minimizing the use of labor in field management while maintaining or even increasing grain yield is by using polymer-coated urea (PCU) instead of conventional urea (CU). This study investigated whether super rice (SR) cultivars could exhibit better yield performance and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) under PCU application than non-super rice (NSR) cultivars. Two representative SR cultivars and two representative NSR cultivars were field grown. Three treatments, no nitrogen application (0N), CU application, and PCU application, were conducted, the application N rate of CU and PCU were both 200 kg N ha(-1). Compared to NSR cultivars, SR cultivars had larger sink size, more productive tillers, larger root biomass and deeper root distribution, higher root oxidation activity at mid-and late grain-filling period, greater aboveground biomass production at mid-and late growth stages, and greater nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) accumulation in the stem and more nonstructural carbohydrate per spikelet (NPS) at anthesis under PCU. Polymer-coated urea increased grain yield and agronomic NUE by 11.6 and 5.5% in SR cultivars and 4.8 and 2.2% in NSR cultivars, respectively. We conclude that using PCU could increase both grain yield and NUE in rice production, especially in SR cultivars. Improved agronomic and physiological performance contributes to an increase in grain yield and NUE in SR cultivars under PCU.

TI A critical review on challenges and trend of ultrapure water production
   process
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The recent and vigorous developments in semiconductor technology strictly request better quality and large quantity of ultrapure water (UPW) for their production. It is crucial to secure a large amount of raw water for the future development of UPW production. Using reclaimed water as alternative raw water source to produce UPW is therefore considered the feasible trend and solution for sustainable use of water resources towards a common future practice in UPW production. The challenge of using reclaimed water is due to its higher content of organic pollutants, especially small molecule organic pollutants such as urea, which are difficult to remove through traditional UPW production process. Consequently, improving the existing UPW production process to meet the water standard desired in the semiconductor industry is essential. This paper reviewed the current traditional processes for removing organic matters in UPW production, including ion-exchange (IX) adsorption, granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, reverse osmosis (RO) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The potential problems in the actual UPW production process were identified when using reclaimed water as raw water source. A new strategy of applying the advanced oxidation process (AOPs) to UPW production as a supplementary unit to guarantee UPW quality was proposed. Its feasibility and research focus were then analyzed and discussed in obtaining a new solution for a future development of the UPW production process.

TI Efficient diesel production over the iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst
   supported on CNTs treated by urea/NaOH
SO FUEL
AB Due to the complex control of nitrogen (N) species in functionalizing the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the contribution of N species to catalysis is difficult to understand. In this study, we report a facile one-pot approach for the synthesis of N-doped CNTs with N present only in the pyrrolic form using a hydrothermal method and by tailoring the treatment conditions, the N content could reach 2.3 at.%. Then the N-doped CNTs are used as a support to prepare an iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalyst. The FTS activity and C5+ selectivity of N-doped CNTs supported iron catalyst increases with an increase of N content up to 2.1% but it decreases with higher pyrrolic N content. The enhanced FTS catalytic performance is attributed to increased electron conduction, electron donor effect and improved surface basicity due to the pyrrolic N incorporated into the carbon framework. Furthermore, a urea/NaOH co-treatment of CNTs is conducted and the treated CNTs is used as a support for preparing an iron catalyst. The results indicate that the synergistic modification effect of NaOH and urea effectively functionalizes the CNTs and leads to the incorporation of the pyrrolic N, to a high graphitization degree, to easy reduction, to a structural integrity and to a strong metal-support interaction of the supported iron catalyst. This results in an increased FTS activity, superior stability and remarkable diesel selectivity (52%). This synergistic effect shows the potential applications of carbon materials in the field of energy storage, carbon dioxide capture and catalysis, with appropriate functionalization.

   desulfurization: Experimental and DFT study
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB In the present work, mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) were synthesized by using a low-cost and unique set of precursors (camphor and urea). The CVD method at 1000 degrees C was used with different camphor/urea ratios, and Co-Mo/MgO nanocatalyst was utilized as growth catalyst. Application of mesoporous N-CNTs in selective oxidation of H2S was studied experimentally and N-CNTs interactions with H2S was also investigated using DFT calculations. The as-synthesized N-CNTs were characterized using FTIR, FE-SEM, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS and nitrogen adsorption/desorption. The N-CNT2 sample with urea to camphor ratio (U/C) of 1 showed the highest sulfur yield at the three temperatures studied for which selectivity and conversion of 89% and 97% were obtained at 190 degrees C. Considering experimental results, the relatively higher amount of pyridinic nitrogen (i.e. pyridinic and pyridinic oxide) was suggested as the reason for such high catalytic activity which was proved by quantum mechanical calculations. Further, DFT calculations were performed for elucidating the reaction and finding the most active nitrogen atoms in which the pyridinic oxide was found to be the most active followed by pyridinic. According to experiment and DFT results, the pyridinic species were determined as the most active phases of N-CNT toward H2S oxidation. (C) 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

TI Reversible switching of wetting properties and erasable patterning of
   polymer surfaces using plasma oxidation and thermal treatment
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Polymer surfaces reversibly switchable from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic by exposure to oxygen plasma and subsequent thermal treatment are demonstrated. Two inherently different polymers, hydrophobic segmented polydimethylsiloxane-urea copolymer (TPSC) and hydrophilic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) are modified with fumed silica nanoparticles to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces with roughness on nanometer to micrometer scale. Smooth TPSC and PMMA surfaces are also used as control samples. Regardless of their chemical structure and surface topography, all surfaces display completely reversible wetting behavior changing from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and back for many cycles upon plasma oxidation followed by thermal annealing. Influence of plasma power, plasma exposure time, annealing temperature and annealing time on the wetting behavior of polymeric surfaces are investigated. Surface compositions, textures and topographies are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and white light interferometry (WLI), before and after oxidation and thermal annealing. Wetting properties of the surfaces are determined by measuring their static, advancing and receding water contact angle. We conclude that the chemical structure and surface topography of the polymers play a relatively minor role in reversible wetting behavior, where the essential factors are surface oxidation and migration of polymer molecules to the surface upon thermal annealing. Reconfigurable water channels on polymer surfaces are produced by plasma treatment using a mask and thermal annealing cycles. Such patterned reconfigurable hydrophilic regions can find use in surface microfluidics and optofluidics applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Powdered activated carbon (PAC)-assisted peroxymonosulfate activation
   for efficient urea elimination in ultrapure water production from
   reclaimed water
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Urea is a problematic pollutant in reclaimed water for ultrapure water (UPW) production. The sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation process (SR-AOP) has been recognized as an effective method for urea degradation. However, conventional metal-based catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation are unsuitable for UPW production due to issues related to metal ion leaching. In this study, the use of powdered activated carbon (PAC) was investigated for the removal of urea from reclaimed water. The PAC exhibited a high degree of defects (I-D/I-G = 1.709) and various surface oxygen functional groups (C-OH, C=O, and C-O), which greatly enhanced its catalytic capability. The PAC significantly facilitated PMS activation in the PMS + PAC system, leading to the complete urea decomposition. The PMS + PAC system demonstrated excellent urea removal efficiency within a wide pH range, except for pH < 3. Among the various anions present, the CO32- and PO43- inhibited urea degradation, while the coexistence of Cl- promoted urea removal. Furthermore, the feasibility test was evaluated using actual reclaimed water. The quenching test revealed that SO4-<middle dot>, <middle dot>OH, and O-2(-)<middle dot> played crucial roles in the degradation of urea in the PAC-assisted SR-AOP. The oxygen functional groups (C-OH and O-C=O) and defect sites of PAC clearly contributed to PMS activation.

TI Improved electrocatalytic methanol oxidation of NiO nanosheet arrays
   with synergistic high surface oxygen vacancy and
   Ni<SUP>3+</SUP>/Ni<SUP>2+</SUP> ratio
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The combination of anodic biomass electrooxidation and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction is an effective strategy to realize energy saving hydrogen production and high value chemical products. Herein, we synthesized dense NiO nanosheet arrays on Ni foam using different heat-treatment temperature, including 400, 450 and 500 & DEG;C. The NiO prepared under 500 & DEG;C owns the highest oxygen defect concentration (58.1%) and Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio (3.13), giving the highest intrinsic activity for methanol electrocatalytic oxidation reaction. However, the NiO prepared at 400 & DEG;C (named as NiO-400) owns highest catalyst surface area and electrochemical surface area, giving the highest practical activity. Based on the above results, a facile method of surface modification by ultraviolet oxidation is proposed to improve the oxygen defect concentration (from 34.7% to 36.8%) and Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio (from 2.94 to 3.19) of NiO-400, and the catalytic current was increased by about 48.9%. This work provides some theoretical basis for improving the activity of biomass electrocatalytic oxidation of Ni-based materials. & COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI N-Doped Carbon Nanofibrous Network Derived from Bacterial Cellulose for
   the Loading of Pt Nanoparticles for Methanol Oxidation Reaction
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB The large-scale, low-cost preparation of Pt-based catalysts with high activity and durability for the methanol oxidation reaction is still challenging. The key to achieving this aim is finding suitable supporting materials. In this paper, N-doped carbon nanofibrous networks are prepared by annealing a gel containing two inexpensive and ecofriendly precursors, that is, bacterial cellulose and urea, for the loading of Pt nanoparticles. An undoped analogue is also prepared for comparison. Meanwhile, the effect of the annealing temperature on the performance of the catalysts is evaluated. The results show that the N doping and higher annealing temperature can improve the electron conductivity of the catalyst and provide more active sites for the loading of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. The best catalyst exhibits a remarkably high electrocatalytic activity (627 mA mg(-1)), excellent poison tolerance, and high durability. This work demonstrates an ideal Pt supporting material for the methanol oxidation reaction.

TI An experimental and modelling study of the electrochemical oxidation of
   pharmaceuticals using a boron-doped diamond anode
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This paper deals with an experimental and modelling study on the electrochemical oxidation of refractory pharmaceuticals using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode. Different parameters have been investigated, such as the role of salts (sulfates), the presence of other organics, and the influence of applied current intensity. Ciprofloxacin (CIP), Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Salbutamol (SALBU) were used for models of pharmaceuticals, and urea as a model for a common organic. The complete removal of pharmaceuticals was observed in all electrolyses under galvanostatic conditions. The presence of common organic waste or other pharmaceutical has no significant impact on the degradation of the CIP target molecule. A mathematical model predicting the temporal concentration variation of organics with electroxidation time has been developed. In this model, different oxidation pathways have been considered: the transfer of electrons (direct oxidation) or of oxygen atoms via the reaction with either hydroxyl radicals or/and with strong electrogenerated oxidants. Excellent correlation with experiments is obtained under all experimental conditions.

TI Large-current-stable bifunctional nanoporous Fe-rich nitride
   electrocatalysts for highly efficient overall water and urea splitting
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Designing highly active electrocatalysts for both the oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions (OER and UOR) with good durability at large current densities is very significant for greatly reducing the power consumption of water electrolysis and wastewater degradation. However, very few electrocatalysts simultaneously exhibit outstanding catalytic activities and large-current durability for both the oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoporous Fe-rich nitride hybrid electrocatalyst possessing extraordinary catalytic OER and UOR activities, as evidenced by extremely small potentials of 1.518 and 1.372 V with impressive long-term durability at a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) for both OER and UOR in base, respectively. Thus far, this is one of the best electrocatalysts embedding excellent OER and UOR properties in a single electrocatalyst. In particular, combined with an efficient NiMoO4-H-2 catalyst for the HER, we have actualized the commercially viable current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at 1.623 V and 1.472 V for overall water and urea electrolysis with outstanding long-term durability, respectively, outperforming most water or urea electrolysers reported hitherto. This work offers a novel approach to develop multifunctional electrocatalysts from earth-abundant elements for the energy-efficient hydrogen production and pollution treatment of urea-rich wastewater.

TI Multistep Dissolution of Lamellar Crystals Generates Superthin Amorphous
   Ni(OH)2 Catalyst for UOR
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an ideal replacement of the conventional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for efficient hydrogen production due to the favorable thermodynamics. However, the UOR activity is severely limited by the high oxidation potential of Ni-based catalysts to form Ni3+, which is considered as the active site for UOR. Herein, by using in situ cryoTEM, cryo-electron tomography, and in situ Raman, combined with theoretical calculations, a multistep dissolution process of nickel molybdate hydrate is reported, whereby NiMoO4 center dot xH(2)O nanosheets exfoliate from the bulk NiMoO4 center dot H2O nanorods due to the dissolution of Mo species and crystalline water, and further dissolution results in superthin and amorphous nickel (II) hydroxide (ANH) flocculus catalyst. Owing to the superthin and amorphous structure, the ANH catalyst can be oxidized to NiOOH at a much lower potential than conventional Ni(OH)(2) and finally exhibits more than an order of magnitude higher current density (640 mA cm(-2)), 30 times higher mass activity, 27 times higher TOF than those of Ni(OH)(2) catalyst. The multistep dissolution mechanism provides an effective methodology for the preparation of highly active amorphous catalysts.

TI Synthesis of PtNFs/PANI/NG with enhanced electrocatalytic activity
   towards methanol oxidation
SO IONICS
AB A novel Pt nanoflowers/polyaniline/nitrogen-doped graphene (PtNFs/PANI/NG) electrocatalyst was prepared by dispersing Pt nanoflowers (PtNFs) onto a polyaniline (PANI) grafted N-doped graphene (NG) matrix through a two-step electrochemical process. Firstly, NG was prepared by a hydrothermal reaction of graphene oxide (GO) with urea, and then electrochemical polymerization of aniline at NG was carried out. Secondly, PtNFs was dispersed onto the film of PANI/NG by electrochemical reduction of H2PtCl6. The as-prepared composites were characterized by SEM, XRD, and Raman spectra. Compared with PtNFs/PANI/G, PtNFs/PANI, and PtNFs/NG catalysts, the novel PtNFs/PANI/NG catalyst exhibits more advantages such as high catalytic activity, excellent poisoning tolerance, and stability characteristic towards methanol electro-oxidation, which is attributed to not only the good dispersion of PtNFs on PANI/NG but also the strong interactions between metal particles and conducting polymer matrixes. The results suggest that the PtNFs/PANI/NG catalyst can be a promising alternative for catalyst in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).

TI Modulating Local Interfacial Bonding Environment of Heterostructures for
   Energy-Saving Hydrogen Production at High Current Densities
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Coupling urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an effective energy-saving technique for hydrogen generation. However, exploring efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts under high current density is still challenging. Herein, hierarchical Fe doped cobalt selenide coupled with FeCo layered double hydroxide (Fe-Co0.85Se/FeCo LDH) array as a self-supported superior bifunctional heterojunction electrode is rationally designed for both UOR and HER. The unique heterostructure facilitates electron transfer and interface interactions through local interfacial Co-Se/O-Fe bonding environment modulation, improving reaction kinetics and intrinsic activity. As a result, the heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits ultralow potentials of -0.274 and 1.48 V to reach 500 mA cm(-2) for catalyzing the HER and UOR, respectively. Particularly, the full urea electrolysis system driven by Fe-Co0.85Se/FeCo LDH delivers 300 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low potential of 1.57 V, which is 150 mV lower than the conventional water electrolysis. The combination of in situ characterization and theoretical analysis reveal that the active sites with the adjustable electronic environment are induced by the interfacial bonding of the heterojunction, facilitating the water decomposition of HER and the stabilization of intermediates in UOR. This work inspires the interfacial environment modulation to optimize advanced electrocatalysts for energy-saving H-2 production.

TI Colorimetric Based Polysorbate Crosslinked Cellulose-Ag-Cu Nanohybrid
   Sensor for Urea Sensing Applications
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Non-enzymatic colorimetric based sensors are rapidly emerging sets of sensors. In this study, cellulose-Ag-Cu nanohybrids were designed to sense urea based on the change in absorbance obtained after the nanohybrid and urea contact. The cellulose-Ag-Cu nanohybrids were characterized with FTIR, SEM, XRD and BET. The bands at 1120, 680 and 620 cm(-1) represents the C-O-C of the biopolymer glycosidic linkage, the Ag-O and Cu-O bands while the SEM shows well dispersed nanoparticles with less agglomeration on the cellulosic rods. Braggs diffraction peaks emerged at 2 theta angles of 18, 38, 44, 64.5 and 79 degrees for the cellulose-Ag-Cu nanohybrid corresponding to the crystalline domain of the cellulose and 111, 200, 220, 222 face centred cubic crystal planes of silver and copper respectively while the BET gave the value of 162.465 as the nanohybrid surface area. The curve of colorimetric concentration versus the prepared urea concentration was fitted on Boltzmann model and a general equation was constructed for the sensing. The limit of detection of the nanohybrid corresponds to 0.8102 ppm urea concentration. The change in absorbance of the nanohybrid increases as the urea concentration increases but decreases as pH increases. The effect of salts was also evaluated and the change in absorbance increases due to indirect oxidation.

TI Spectroscopic Investigation of Titania-Supported Gold Nanoparticles
   Prepared by a Modified Deposition/Precipitation Method for the Oxidation
   of CO
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB The spectroscopic characterization of a material is a fundamental tool for understanding the structure-activity correlation for catalytic purposes. Regarding supported nanoparticles, this perspective has acquired more relevance in recent years and several techniques have been employed. In this work diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), coupled with CO adsorption, was used to investigate a modified deposition/precipitation method (DP-UC) for the preparation of supported gold nanoparticles with very low metal loading (0.1-0.5wt%). This promising synthetic route involves the use of urea as basic agent and NaBH4 as chemical reductant in contrast to the traditional high-temperature reduction step. The systematic IR spectroscopic study of the Au loading was combined with CO oxidation catalytic tests. The evaluation of the results was also supported by several other techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, N-2 physisorption, and transmission electron microscopy. Particular attention was given to the evaluation of the gold electronic state, surface dispersion, particle size, and the corresponding structure-activity relationship.

TI Base excision repair of the N-(2-deoxy-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-urea
   lesion by the hNEIL1 glycosylase
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The N-(2-deoxy-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-urea DNA lesion forms following hydrolytic fragmentation of cis-5R,6S- and trans-5R,6R-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidine (thymine glycol, Tg) or from oxidation of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and subsequent hydrolysis. It interconverts between alpha and beta deoxyribose anomers. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing this adduct are efficiently incised by unedited (K242) and edited (R242) forms of the hNEIL1 glycosylase. The structure of a complex between the active site unedited mutant C Delta 100 P2G hNEIL1 (K242) glycosylase and double-stranded (ds) DNA containing a urea lesion reveals a pre-cleavage intermediate, in which the Gly2 N-terminal amine forms a conjugate with the deoxyribose C1 ' of the lesion, with the urea moiety remaining intact. This structure supports a proposed catalytic mechanism in which Glu3-mediated protonation of O4 ' facilitates attack at deoxyribose C1 '. The deoxyribose is in the ring-opened configuration with the O4 ' oxygen protonated. The electron density of Lys242 suggests the 'residue 242-in conformation' associated with catalysis. This complex likely arises because the proton transfer steps involving Glu6 and Lys242 are hindered due to Glu6-mediated H-bonding with the Gly2 and the urea lesion. Consistent with crystallographic data, biochemical analyses show that the C Delta 100 P2G hNEIL1 (K242) glycosylase exhibits a residual activity against urea-containing dsDNA.

TI Nickel-Vanadium-Manganese Trimetallic Nitride as Energy Saving,
   Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Water Splitting via
   Urea Electrocatalysis
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Hydrogen production through pure water electrolysis is often found less economic as it requires high potential for water oxidation. The presence of urea in water involving effective urea oxidation can be considered as an effective strategy to produce hydrogen economically. Herein, we develop trimetallic nickel vanadium manganese nitride porous microspheres as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both urea oxidation reaction (UOR) as well as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mechanisms. The optimized NiVMn nitride exhibits eye-catching UOR activity along with HER activity that required only 1.36 and -0.253 V electrode potentials, respectively, to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm-2. Combining its bifunctional activity in UOR and HER in a two-electrode system, an energy saving by 0.26 V potential compared to water electrolysis through water oxidation can be acquired to reach 50 mA cm-2 current density. The presence of manganese(II) has a significant influence in stabilizing high valence V(V) and Ni(II), offering large number of active sites, and during UOR, the effective electronic transitions are more between Mn-* Ni rather than Mn-* V, leading to excellent and stable UOR performance. Indeed, the electrocatalyst and the approach offering considerable energy saving phenomena are believed to make hydrogen production more economic and sustainable.

TI Photon-independent NaOH/H2O2-based degradation of
   rhodamine-B dye in aqueous medium: Kinetics, and impacts of various
   inorganic salts, antioxidants, and urea
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The present study reports an advantageous approach over the photon-dependent advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as UV or visible light dependent homogeneous or heterogeneous photocatalysis. Herein, we investigated the potential of a homogeneous cum alkali-catalyzed H2O2 decomposition based oxidation process (NaOH/H2O2 process) for the degradation of rhodamine-B (RhB) dye present in aqueous medium. The degradation of RhB follows pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics with rate constant (k(avg.))= 0.0745 min(-1) (R-2 >= 0.99) for 0.15M NaOH and 1500 ppm (about 0.044 M) H2O2 concentrations. In addition, the degradation of RhB via NaOH/H2O2 process is found to be significantly influenced by the concentration of H2O2 as per the correlation: k(observed) (min(-1)) = (5.55 x 10(-5) (min(-1). ppm(-1)) x C-H2O2 (ppm)), at a fixed dose of NaOH (0.15 M) that controls the total reaction pH (> 11). Moreover, compared with other AOPs, this method requires moderate conditions with low-cost raw materials, and there are no temperature gradients and H2O2 stabilizers' requirements. However, this process has shown selective effectiveness for the degradation of cationic dyes. Besides this, NaOH/H2O2 process is hardly influenced by the presence of inorganic anions (Cl-, PO43-, SO42-, NO3-, and CO32-), except bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) that have shown a significant decrement in the RhB degradation efficiency. Furthermore, the typical doses of antioxidants and urea are also found to be quite impuissant to diminish this process.

TI Durable Pulse-Electrodeposited Ni-Fe-S Nanosheets Supported on a Ni-S
   Three Dimensional Pattern as Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for
   Hydrogen Evolution and Urea Oxidation Reactions
SO LANGMUIR
AB This study aims to establish easy-to-fabricate and novel structures for the synthesis of highly active and enduring electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Gradient electrodeposition and four different time regimes were utilized to synthesize Ni-S 3D patterns with the optimization of electrodeposition time. Pulse electrodeposition was employed for the synthesis of Ni-Fe-S nanosheets at three different frequencies and duty cycles to optimize the pulse electrodeposition parameters. The sample synthesized at 13 min of gradient electrodeposition with a 1 Hz frequency and 0.7 duty cycle for pulse electrodeposition demonstrated the best electrocatalytic performance. The optimized electrode further showed remarkable performance for HER and UOR reactions, requiring only 54 mV and 1.25 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and UOR, respectively. Moreover, the overall cell voltage of the two-electrode system in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea was measured at 1.313 V, delivering 10 mA cm(-2). Constructing Ni-Fe-S nanosheets on 3D Ni-S significantly increased the electrochemical surface area from 51 to 278 for the Ni-S and Ni-Fe-S layers. Tafel slopes were measured as 138 and 182 mV dec(-1) for the HER and UOR for the Ni-S coating layer and 97 mV dec(-1) for the HER and 131 mV dec(-1) for the UOR for the optimal Ni-Fe-S nanosheets on Ni-S. Minimal changes in the potential were observed at 100 mA cm(-2) in 50 h regarding the HER and UOR, signifying exceptional electrocatalytic stability. This study provides economically viable, highly active, and long-lasting electrocatalysts suitable for HER and UOR applications.

   nano-micro-dendrites
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Substituting the OER process with a more thermodynamically favorable process, like the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), leads to energy-saving hydrogen production. Here, the three-dimensional and hierarchical Ni-Co-S@NiCo-Cu nanostructure was successfully synthesized and its electrocatalytic behavior was investigated. Investigations of the electrocatalytic behavior showed the unique performance of the Ni-Co-S@Ni-Co-Cu electrode, where in optimized conditions, in the HER process, to achieve 10 mA.cm  2 current density, the overpotential value was 68 mV. Also, when the Ni-Co-S@Ni-Co-Cu electrode was employed in both in HER and UOR processes simultaneously, to achieve the 10 mA.cm  2 current density, 1.38 V was needed. Also, the results of electrocatalytic stability represented insignificant changes in voltage over long periods (100 mA.cm  2, 50 h). The reason for such outstanding electrochemical performance in activity and stability point of view, was the synergistic effect between elements, large active surface area, using a binder-free method, and the regular hierarchical structure.

   oxidation of sulfides
SO JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB In the following research, meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrinatomanganese (III) acetate (MnTCPP(OAc)) was immobilized onto the surface of two functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with different linker length via amide bond (Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-MnTCPP(OAc) (A1) and Fe3O4@SiO2-NHCO-NH2-MnTCPP(OAc) (A2)). The prepared catalysts were characterized by standard methods such as: atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Ultra violet-visible (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques and also the effect of the length of the linker on the catalytic activity of supported magnetic nanohybrids was investigated. The prepared magnetic nano-catalysts with different linker lengths were participated in a comparative study of the clean oxidation of sulfides with urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in ethanol. The higher catalytic activity, selectivity and also reusability were achieved in the presence of the catalyst with longer linker length (A2) at ambient temperature. Moreover, the turnover number (TON) of catalytic reactions using A2 as catalyst was highly enough to consider the catalyst as an efficient material to oxidize various sulfides. Both A1 and A2 catalysts simply have accomplished 5 runs of recycling without significant decrease in the catalytic activity.
   This work reports investigation on the effect of linker length on the catalytic efficiency of the immobilized manganese porphyrin onto the surface of modified silica coated magnetic nanoparticles for the green oxidation of sulfides. image

For the sake of comparison, a g-C3N4 sample obtained in the presence of cyanuric acid and thermally exfoliated C3N4 powders were also studied. The materials were physicochemically characterized and their photocatalytic activity was studied for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA), 4-methoxy benzyl alcohol (4-MBA) and piperonyl alcohol (PA) in water suspension both under UV and visible light irradiation. The influence of the type and position of the substituents on conversion and selectivity to aldehyde was remarkable. The presence of P in the C3N4 material improved the selectivity of the reaction towards the aldehyde.

TI Synthesis of Cu-Co Catalysts for Methanol Decomposition to Hydrogen
   Production via Deposition-Precipitation with Urea Method
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB A series of CuxCoy catalysts were successfully synthesized by deposition-precipitation with urea method and their catalytic performance was investigated for methanol decomposition to hydrogen. These as-prepared samples were characterized by ICP-OES, XRD, SEM, BET, H-2-TPR and XPS. The characterization results indicate that the bimetallic catalysts exhibit better dispersion and reducibility as compared with the monometallic catalysts, and the strong interaction between copper and cobalt can promote the formation of Cu+. Among the fabricated materials, the Cu0.5Co0.5 presents the best catalytic activity and H-2 selectivity. Moreover, its catalytic performance is higher than the commercial catalyst at the same test conditions.Graphical AbstractThe catalytic performance of bimetallic CuxCoy catalytic is better than that of monometallic catalysts. Meanwhile, the optimized catalyst prepared exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity compared with the commercial catalysts at the same reaction conditions, which is due to the coexist of Cu+ and Cu2+ after reduction.

TI Titania and zirconia binary oxides as catalysts for total oxidation of

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Template assisted hydrothermal and homogeneous precipitation with urea techniques were used for the preparation of TiO2-ZrO2 binary oxides with wide range variation of their composition. Low temperature nitrogen physisorption, XRD, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, UV-vis, FTIR, FTIR of adsorbed pyridine and Raman spectroscopy were used for the characterization of the obtained samples. Their catalytic properties were tested in total oxidation of ethyl acetate as a representative VOCs and methanol decomposition as hydrogen carrier. It was established that the template assisted hydrothermal technique provoked preparation of materials with good crystallinity, high BET surface area and well developed mesoporous structure, while the homogeneous precipitation with urea method facilitated the formation of more highly dispersed in wide Zr/Ti region samples. The degree of incorporation of Zr4+ ions into titania lattice could be controlled by the samples composition and the preparation method used, which revealed good opportunity for effective and simple regulation of their catalytic properties.

TI Accelerated Dual Activation of Lattice Oxygen and Molecule Oxygen over
   CoMn2O4 Catalysts for VOC Oxidation: Promoting the
   Role of Oxygen Vacancies
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB The in-depth activation mechanism of oxygen species (including lattice oxygen and gaseous oxygen) for catalytic oxidation reactions has not been elucidated and still remains a question on the experimental level. In this work, the dual activation of lattice oxygen and molecule oxygen for highly efficient volatile organic compound oxidation was observed on spinel catalysts through the construction of oxygen vacancy engineering (urea modification). The active surface lattice oxygen species were generated via weakening the metal-oxygen bond strength, which could be easily activated to participate in the catalytic oxidation of toluene to form CO2. Simultaneously, the activation ability of gaseous molecular oxygen was also enhanced to promote the replenishment of lattice oxygen species. Moreover, the formation and consumption rates of intermediates could be significantly accelerated due to the dual activation of oxygen species. Hence, the U400 catalyst (T-90 = 217 degrees C) exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic performance for toluene oxidation compared with the pristine catalyst (T-90 = 250 degrees C). This work provided a credible comprehension of the dual activation process of lattice oxygen and molecule oxygen in the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation reaction, which was efficient for developing a pathway to boost the catalytic oxidation activity.

TI An enzyme-free sensor based on La-doped CoFe-layered double hydroxide
   decorated on reduced graphene oxide for sensitive electrochemical
   detection of urea
SO MICROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The successful synthesis of La-doped CoFe LDH@rGO nanocomposite is reported combining the advantages of LDH and rGO and shows promising performances in electrochemical sensors. The structure of the obtained nanocomposite was investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscope images (FE-SEM). Then, it was directly utilized to construct a carbon paste electrode (CPE) for urea detection. The electrochemical performance of the sensor was evaluated by various electrochemical methods. The La-CoFe LDH@rGO electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic properties, including a wide linear working range of 0.001-23.5 mM, very high sensitivity of 1.07 +/- 0.023 mu A mu M-1 cm-2, a low detection limit of 0.33 +/- 0.11 mu M, and rapid response time of 5 s towards urea detection at the working potential of 0.4 V. Furthermore, the sensor displayed a high selectivity in different matrices, appropriate reproducibility, and long shelf life without activity loss during 3 months of storage under ambient conditions. Further tests were performed on serum and milk samples to confirm the capability of the proposed sensor for practical applications, demonstrating a reasonable recovery of 94.8 to 102% with an RSD value below 3%. Consequently, the synergistic effect of each component led to the good electrocatalytic activity of the modified electrode towards urea.

TI Yield-scaled greenhouse gas emissions from the use of common urea and
   controlled-release nitrogen fertiliser in a subtropical paddy rice field
SO SOIL RESEARCH
AB Suitable nitrogen (N) fertilisation is key for economic and environmental sustainability of croplands, and little is known on the potential of slow-release N sources to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions in paddy rice growing in subtropical lowlands. We assessed the impact of controlled-released N fertiliser (CRNF) on partial global warming potential (pGWP) and yield-scaled greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (GHG emission per unit of yield) in comparison to common urea in irrigated rice growing in a Typic Albaqualf in southern Brazil. The field experiment comprised four treatments: (1) control; (2) common urea applied into three splits, and CRNF applied at rice sowing; (3) on soil surface; and (4) in the seeding furrow. The N fertilisers did not increase N2O emissions when compared to control with exception of CRNF at the seeding furrow. However, N fertilisation increased CH4 emissions, with exception of the CRNF applied to the seeding furrow. Rice grain yields (7954-8637 kg ha(-1)) were not affected by N sources. The pGWP (11 683-14 297 kg CO2 eq ha(-1)) and the yield-scaled GHG (1.47-1.74 kg CO2 eq kg(-1) grain) were similar among N sources. N fertilisation is a crucial practice to obtain high rice yields, which did not affect negatively the yield-scaled GHG emissions in this subtropical environment under continuous flood irrigation. CRNF applied at rice sowing provides rice grain productivity and agronomic efficiency similar to common urea applied into three splits.

TI Hyperammonemia after capecitabine associated with occult impairment of
   the urea cycle
SO CANCER MEDICINE
AB Background Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy often complain of "chemobrain" or cognitive impairment, but mechanisms remain elusive. Methods A patient with gastric cancer developed delirium and hyperammonemia after chemotherapy with the 5-fluorouracil pro-drug capecitabine. Exome sequencing facilitated a search for mutations among 43 genes associated with hyperammonemia and affecting the urea cycle directly or indirectly. Results The patient's urea cycle was impaired by capecitabine-induced liver steatosis, and portosystemic shunting of gut ammonia into the systemic circulation. The patient was also heterozygous for amino acid substitution mutations previously reported to create dysfunctional proteins in 2 genes, ORNT2 (ornithine transporter-2 for the urea cycle), and ETFA (electron transport flavoprotein alpha for fatty acid oxidation). The mutations explained the patient's abnormal plasma amino acid profile and exaggerated response to allopurinol challenge. Global population variations among the 43 hyperammonemia genes were assessed for inactivating mutations, and for amino acid substitutions predicted to be deleterious by complementary algorithms, SIFT and PolyPhen-2. One or 2 deleterious mutations occur among the 43 genes in 13.9% and 1% of individuals, respectively. Conclusions Capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil inhibit pyrimidine biosynthesis, decreasing ammonia utilization. These drugs can induce hyperammonemia in susceptible individuals. The risk factors of hyperammonemia, gene mutations and liver dysfunction, are not rare. Diagnosis will trigger appropriate treatment and ameliorate brain toxicity.

TI Unlocking Efficient Hydrogen Production: Nucleophilic Oxidation
   Reactions Coupled with Water Splitting
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Electrocatalytic water splitting driven by sustainable energy is a clean and promising water-chemical fuel conversion technology for the production of high-purity green hydrogen. However, the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pose challenges for large-scale hydrogen production, limiting its efficiency and safety. Recently, the anodic OER has been replaced by a nucleophilic oxidation reaction (NOR) with biomass as the substrate and coupled with a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which has attracted great interest. Anode NOR offers faster kinetics, generates high-value products, and reduces energy consumption. By coupling NOR with hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen production efficiency can be enhanced while yielding high-value oxidation products or degrading pollutants. Therefore, NOR-coupled HER hydrogen production is another new green electrolytic hydrogen production strategy after electrolytic water hydrogen production, which is of great significance for realizing sustainable energy development and global decarbonization. This review explores the potential of nucleophilic oxidation reactions as an alternative to OER and delves into NOR mechanisms, guiding future research in NOR-coupled hydrogen production. It assesses different NOR-coupled production methods, analyzing reaction pathways and catalyst effects. Furthermore, it evaluates the role of electrolyzers in industrialized NOR-coupled hydrogen production and discusses future prospects and challenges. This comprehensive review aims to advance efficient and economical large-scale hydrogen production.

TI CuO{001} as the Most Active Exposed Facet for Allylic Oxidation of
   Cyclohexene via a Greener Route
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB Allylic oxidation of olefins to alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, especially2-cyclohexen-1-one, by the oxidation of cyclohexene is a prime chemical transformation in the organic industry due to its immense application as an intermediate in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceutical products, and perfumery products. Herein, we demonstrate microstructured copper oxide (CuO) as an efficient catalyst to oxidize cyclohexene to 2-cyclohexen-1-oneand other value-added intermediates in the presence of aerobic molecular oxygen as oxidant at 80 degrees C with outstanding conversion of cyclohexene and high selectivity towards 2-cyclohexen-1-one. CuO with diverse shapes was synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method. CuO plates (PLs) and flowers (FLs) were obtained by varying the ammonia and sodium hydroxide concentration, and CuO spheres (SPs) and hollow spheres (HSs) were prepared by varying the urea concentration. Under optimized conditions, the CuO FL2 catalyst shows the highest conversion of cyclohexene (97.6 %) due to its smaller size, higher surface charge, and high-energy {001} exposed facets. Reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, reaction duration, and catalyst concentration were varied to obtain the optimal reaction conditions for cyclohexene oxidation. Moreover, the CuO FL2 catalyst was recycled several times without any significant loss of catalytic activity, which ascertains recyclability and high stability of the catalyst for industrial use.

TI Urea-Assisted Synthesis of Mesoporous TiO2 Photocatalysts for
   the Efficient Removal of Clofibric Acid from Water
SO MATERIALS
AB Mesoporous TiO2 photocatalysts intended for the advanced removal of clofibric acid (CA) from water were synthesized by the sol-gel method in a medium containing cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) and urea, using either ethanol or isopropanol to dilute the TiO2 precursor. The activation of the samples was undertaken at 550, 650 and 750 degrees C. The XRD revealed that the nature of the solvent resulted in significant differences in the anatase-to-rutile ratios obtained at different temperatures. The specific surface area values were situated between 9 and 43 m(2)center dot g(-1) and the band gap values were similar for all the samples. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples was examined for the degradation of CA, an emergent water contaminant. The photocatalytic tests performed under UV-A irradiation revealed that the photo-reactivity of these materials depends on the calcination temperature. The best results were obtained for the samples calcined at 750 degrees C, which showed high yields of CA elimination, as well as almost complete mineralization (over 95%) after 180 min of reaction. Good results in terms of catalyst reusability in the reaction were found for the catalyst showing the highest photo-reactivity. Therefore, the samples can be considered good candidates for future water remediation applications.

TI Carbon dioxide and nitrate co-electroreduction to urea on
   CuOxZnOy
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY
AB Urea is a commonly used nitrogen fertiliser synthesised from ammonia and carbon dioxide using thermal catalysis. This process results in high carbon dioxide emissions associated with the required amounts of ammonia. Electrocatalysis provides an alternative method to urea production with reduced carbon emissions while utilising waste products like nitrate. This manuscript reports on urea synthesis from the electroreduction of nitrate and carbon dioxide using CuOxZnOy electrodes under mild conditions. Catalysts with different ratios of CuO and ZnO, synthesised via flame spray pyrolysis, were explored for the reaction. The results revealed that all the CuOxZnOy electrocatalyst compositions produce urea, but the efficiency strongly depends on the metal ratio composition of the catalysts. The CuO50ZnO50 composition had the best performance in terms of selectivity (41% at -0.8 V vs RHE) and activity (0.27 mA/cm(2) at -0.8 V vs RHE) towards urea production. Thus, this material is one of the most efficient electrocatalysts for urea production reported so far. This study systematically evaluates bimetallic catalysts with varying compositions for urea synthesis from carbon dioxide and nitrate.

TI 2D Ni-organic frameworks decorated carbon nanotubes encapsulated Ni
   nanoparticles for robust C-N and H-O bonds cleavage
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB In this work, we report a robust bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of 2D Ni- organic frameworks (Ni-MOF) and nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (Ni-MOF@Ni-NCNT) for C-N and H-O bonds dissociation. Due to the presence of Ni-NCNT, adsorption of OH- species is enhanced and CO2 binding strength is simultaneously weakened leading to a boosted urea oxidation reaction performance reflected by decrement in potential at 100 mA cm-2 by 69 mV. The loosened binding strength with CO2 specie is highlighted by in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test and DFT calculation. Moreover, the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of Ni-MOF@Ni-NCNT is better than Ni-MOF and Ni-NCNT evidenced by the overpotential at 50 mA cm-2 decreased by 224 mV and 900 mV ascribed to the synergistic effect, in which Ni-MOF, Ni nanoparticles and Ni-Nx-C facilitates water adsorption, dissociation and adsorption/ combination of hydrogen ions, respectively. The assembled HER- urea oxidation reaction (UOR) system requires only 1.33 V to reach 10 mA cm-2, 70 mV lower than water splitting driven by Pt/C-IrO2.

TI Solution-combustion Synthesized Nano-pellet
   α-Al2O3 and Catalytic Oxidation of
   Cyclohexane by Its Supported Cobalt Acetate
SO JOURNAL OF WUHAN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY-MATERIALS SCIENCE EDITION
AB Nano-pellet alpha-Al2O3 was prepared using aluminum nitrate as precursor and urea as fuel by a fast method of solution combustion synthesis. The formation of the nano material was dependent on the molar ratio of fuel/oxidant, calcination temperature, and foreign metallic ions. The prerequisite conditions of the formation were a suitable fuel/oxidant molar ratio larger than two and calcination temperature higher than 673 K. Foreign ions, Ce4+ or Co2+, hindered this formation via promoting the generation of stable penta-coordinated Al3+ ions due to strong interaction with alumina, were revealed by Al-27 NMR spectra. Such Al3+ ions were recognized as a critical intermediate state for the phase transformation of alumina and their presence deterred the transformation. The nano-pellet morphology of the product demonstrated a specific surface area of 69 m(2)/g, of which the external surface area occupied 59 m(2)/g. It was found that the supported cobalt acetate on such nanopellets existed as nanoparticles attached to the external surface, evidenced by the TEM characterization. The prepared catalyst could efficiently catalyze the selective oxidation of cyclohexane under the reaction condition of pressure under 0.8 MPa, temperature at 373 K, and time for 4 hours. The conversion of the reaction achieved up to 7.9%; while the cyclohexanone selectivity was 42.7% and the cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol selectivity was 91.6%. This catalytic performance recommends the supported cobalt acetate on the inert nano-pellet alpha-Al2O3 as a promising catalyst for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane.

TI Efficient and selective oxidation of alcohols with tert-BuOOH
   catalyzed by a dioxomolybdenum(VI) Schiff base complex under organic
   solvent-free conditions
SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB The catalytic activity of dioxidobis{2-[(E)-p-tolyliminomethyl]phenolato} molybdenum(VI) complex was studied, for the first time, in the selective oxidation of various primary and secondary alcohols using tert-BuOOH as oxidant under organic solvent-free conditions at room temperature. The effect of different solvents was studied in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in this catalytic system. It was found that, under organic solvent-free conditions, the catalyst oxidized various primary and secondary alcohols to their corresponding aldehyde or ketone derivatives with high yield. The effects of other parameters such as oxidant and amount of catalyst were also investigated. Among different oxidants such as H2O2, NaIO4, tert-BuOOH, and H2O2/urea, tert-BuOOH was selected as oxygen donor in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Also, it was found that oxidation of benzyl alcohol required 0.02 mmol catalyst for completion. Dioxomolybdenum(VI) Schiff base complex exhibited good catalytic activity in the oxidation of alcohols with tert-BuOOH under mild conditions. In this catalytic system, different primary alcohols gave the corresponding aldehydes in good yields without further oxidation to carboxylic acids.

   base complexes as efficient catalysts in oxidation of phenol
SO JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB New phosphazene nanosphere-supported Fe(III), Co(II) and Cu(II) Schiff base complexes were prepared and their catalytic activities were investigated. The synthesized compounds were characterized by various techniques such as FT-IR, XRD, TGA, SEM, EDX, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The average diameters of these nanosphere compounds are about 250 nm and they are spherically uniform with very good stability. The effect of the support on catalytic activity of the metal complexes was determined by investigating the oxidation of phenol under different experimental conditions. These complexes exhibit high activity in oxidation of phenol under relatively mild condition in the presence of urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) as an oxidant. The influence of various parameters such as amount of catalyst, phenol:UHP molar ratio, and temperature on the rate of the oxidation reaction of phenol was also evaluated. Based on the characterization results and the experimental evidences a plausible mechanism has been proposed.

CL Cancun, MEXICO
AB Gold nanoparticles supported on titania nanostructured materials were prepared, characterized and tested in CO oxidation. Two nanostructured supports were used: titania nanotubes (TNT) synthesized by the Kasuga method and titania nanotubes decorated with TiO2 anatase nanocrystals prepared by post-synthetic treatment of TNT with 0.05 M HNO3 solution at 70 degrees C for 48 h (TNT-T). Gold catalysts with 4 wt.% of Au nominal loading were prepared by deposition-precipitation with urea. A reference Au catalyst supported on TiO2 Degussa P-25 was also prepared. Supports and catalysts were characterized by N-2 physisorption, XRD, UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy, TPR, SEM-EDX and HRTEM. HRTEM characterization showed that gold nanoparticles with an average size between 2 and 7 nm were obtained in all catalysts making them suitable for CO oxidation. Catalytic tests showed differences in activity and stability among the prepared catalysts. The Au/TNT catalyst presented poor activity for CO oxidation, meanwhile the Au/TNT-T catalyst showed higher activity than the Au/TiO2 Degussa P-25, especially at a low temperature interval (-10 to 100 degrees C). Stability tests performed for Au/TNT-T and Au/TiO2 Degussa P-25 catalysts at 25 degrees C revealed higher stability of the Au/TNT-T catalyst, attributed to low sintering of gold nanoparticles.

TI Impact of a Novel Nickel-Based Catalyst and Phenyl-Acrylate-Based
   Anion-Exchange Membrane in a Direct Urea Fuel Cell
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB Developing target-specific catalysts and anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) is crucial for direct urea fuel cell (DUFC) performance. To advance the DUFC system, we developed an anode catalyst with a nickel-iron oxyhydroxide/carbon (NiFeOOH/C) nanofibrous structure for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), where we optimized the Ni/Fe molar ratio as 6:4. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the anode (Ni6Fe4OOH/C) is attributed to the hydroxide group, which responds with urea molecules to enhance the UOR in a pH-neutral system. Furthermore, we employed a recently developed cross-linked phenyl-acrylate-based AEM (PA/M). A DUFC prepared with the anode and PA/M generates a maximum power density of 11.1 mW/cm(2) and 0.92 V open-circuit voltage under 3 M urea as fuel at 25 degrees C. We further analyzed the applicability of PA/M in a DUFC system by measuring the urea partition coefficients and permeabilities over a range of concentrations.

TI Different responses of nitrogen fertilization on methane emission in
   rice plant included and excluded soils during cropping season
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Since nitrogen (N) fertilization is the most efficient practice for increasing rice production, N fertilizer consumptions have continued to increase globally. Therefore, the effects of N fertilization on CH4 emission characteristics have been extensively studied. However, no consistent conclusions to N fertilization on CH4 cycles have been drawn so far. In order to evaluate the effect of N fertilization on CH4 fluxes in rice fields, N fertilizer (urea) was applied at different levels (0-180 kg N ha(-1)) in a typical temperate paddy soil, and CH4 emissions were characterized under two different soil conditions during cropping seasons (rice plant included and excluded soils). Seasonal CH4 fluxes responded differently to N fertilization between the rice plants included and excluded soils. In rice plant excluded soils, total CH4 fluxes significantly increased with increasing N fertilization levels. However, in rice plant included soils, seasonal CH4 fluxes changed with a quadratic response. Total CH4 fluxes increased with increasing N fertilization by 115-137 kg N ha(-1) and later decreased. The difference in seasonal CH4 fluxes between the two soils might be caused by rice rhizospheric activities and this difference could be defined as the minimum CH4 oxidation potentials of rice rhizosphere. This CH4 oxidation potential significantly increased with increasing N fertilization levels, and is highly correlated with total biomass, straw and root biomass productivities. Therefore, the decrease in CH4 fluxes by high levels of N fertilization in rice plant included soils might be caused by the increasing N fertilization-induced CH4 consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Fibrin self-assembly is adapted to oxidation
SO FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Fibrinogen is extremely susceptible to attack by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Having been suffered an oxidative modification, the fibrinogen molecules, now with altered spatial structure and function of fibrin network, affect hemostasis differently. However, the potential effects of the oxidative stress on the early stages of the fibrin self-assembly process remain unexplored. To clarify the damaging influence of ROS on the knob 'A': hole 'a' and the D:D interactions, the both are operating on the early stages of the fibrin polymerization, we have used a novel approach based on exploration of FXIIIa-mediated self-assembly of the cross-linked fibrin oligomers dissolved in the moderately concentrated urea solutions. The oligomers were composed of monomeric desA fibrin molecules created by cleaving the fibrinopeptides A off the fibrinogen molecules with a thrombin-like enzyme, reptilase. According to the UV-absorbance and fluorescence measurements data, the employed low ozone/fibrinogen ratios have induced only a slight fibrinogen oxidative modification that was accompanied by modest chemical transformations of the aromatic amino acid residues of the protein. Else, a slight consumption of the accessible tyrosine residues has been observed due to intermolecular dityrosine cross-links formation. The set of experimental data gathered with the aid of electrophoresis, elastic light scattering and analytical centrifugation has clearly witnessed that the oxidation can serve as an effective promoter for the observed enhanced self-assembly of the covalently cross-linked oligomers. At urea concentration of 1.20 M, the pristine and oxidized fibrin oligomers were found to comprise a heterogeneous set of the double-stranded protofibrils that are cross-linked only by gamma-gamma dimers and the fibers consisting on average of four strands that are additionally linked by alpha polymers. The amounts of the oxidized protofibrils and the fibers accumulated in the system were higher than those of the non-oxidized counterparts. Moreover, the gamma and alpha polypeptide chains of the oxidized molecules were more readily crosslinked by the FXIIIa. Upon increasing the urea solution concentration to 4.20 M, the cross-linked double-stranded desA fibrin protofibrils have dissociated into the single-stranded fibrin oligomers, whereas the fibers dissociated into both the double stranded desA fibrin oligomers, the structural integrity of the latter being maintained by means of the intermolecular alpha polymers, and the single-stranded fibrin oligomers cross-linked only by gamma-gamma dimers. The data we have obtained in this study indicate that the FXIIIa-mediated process of assembling the cross-linked protofibrils and the fibers constructed from the oxidized monomeric fibrin molecules was facilitated due to the strengthening of D:D interactions. The findings infer that the enhanced longitudinal D:D interactions become more essential in the assembly of soluble protofibrils when the interactions knobs 'A': holes 'a' are injured by oxidation. The new experimental findings presented here could be of help for elucidating the essential adaptive molecular mechanisms capable of mitigating the detrimental action of ROS in the oxidatively damaged fibrin self-assemblage processes.

TI Ni-Fe phosphide deposited carbon felt as free-standing bifunctional
   catalyst electrode for urea electrolysis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A free-standing catalyst electrode for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a urea electrolysis cell was synthesized by electroplating a Ni-Fe alloy onto carbon felt, followed by phosphidation (P-NiFe@CF). The prepared P-NiFe@CF catalyst consisted of Ni5P4, NiP2, and FeP with 3D flower-like P-NiFe architecture on CF. P-NiFe@CF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the UOR (demanding only 1.39 V (vs. RHE) to achieve 200 mA cm(-2)), and for the HER with a low overpotential of 0.023 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2), indicating its feasibility as a bifunctional catalyst electrode for urea electrolysis. A urea electrolysis cell with P-NiFe@CF as both the free-standing anode and cathode generated a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell potential of 1.37 V (vs. RHE), which is considerably lower than that of water electrolysis, and also lower than previously reported values. The results indicate that the P-NiFe@CF catalyst electrodes can be used as free-standing bifunctional electrodes for urea electrolyzers.

TI Dietary potato peel extract reduces the toxicity of cholesterol
   oxidation products in rats
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS
AB We determined the polyphenolic profiles of the potato peel by HPLC. To elucidate the effect of potato peel extract (PPE) on the toxicity of cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) in rats, a synthetic polyphenolic mixture was prepared, mimicking the composition of PPE. Six groups were treated with a control diet, an oxidized cholesterol diet, a PPE diet, an oxidized cholesterol plus PPE diet, and various doses (1-3%) of the PPE diet. After treatment, significantly increased liver glutathione and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity levels; superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities; and mRNA expression were observed in the rats treated with 2% and 3% doses of the PPE diet and significantly decreased aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and COPs levels were observed compared with the control rats. These results demonstrated the PPE diet reduction in the long-term toxicity of COPs was significant in rats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Microbial ureolysis and ammonium oxidation in rice (Oryza
   sativa) rhizosphere: Impact of different fertilizers
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB Nitrogen is a crucial nutrient for rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity, and chemical N fertilizers are often applied to enhance rice production. However, the response of soil microbial activity and corresponding functional genes to chemical fertilization remains unclear. The present study was carried out during rainy (kharif) seasons of 2019 and 2020 at the research farms of ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to study in the microbial responses to different concentration of nitrogen and fertilizers applied to the soil of rice fields. Study included a microcosmic experiment with 3 N concentrations (0, 10, and 100 mM), and treatment included were T1, RDF; T2, 50% N as urea and KNO3 at 75:25 with PK; T3, 50% N as urea and KNO3 at 75:25 with PK and ammonium oxidizing microbial consortium. Nitrogen addition at 10 and 100 mM increased urease activity by 19-26%, potential ammonium oxidation (PAO) by 16-49%, and ureC gene copies by 10-22%. Indeed, treated soils possessed 1.2 to 6.5 folds' higher copies of archaeal- and bacterial amoA. In the field experiments, the rhizosphere of T1 showed the highest urease and PAO activities while having the lowest activity of ammonification. The abundance of ureC, archaeal-, and bacterial amoA genes ranged from 2.9x106 to 2.0x107, 4.6x103 to 2.4x104, and 2.3 to 9.4x106 copies/g soil, respectively. The ureC gene copies were more abundant in T1, while archaeal and bacterial amoA genes exhibited the highest copies in T3. Urease activity and ureC copies were highest during the vegetative stage, while PAO, and archaeal- and bacterial amoA gene copies were enriched during the flowering stage. The gene abundance and associated enzymatic activities showed a strong correlation, implying that structural changes in the microbial community due to different combinations of fertilizers might alter the nutrient turnover in soil. Our results showed that N-fertilizers could significantly alter the structure and activities of microbial communities, and appropriate N fertilization is necessary for improving the sustainability of rice cultivation.

TI 1,3-Disubstituted urea derivatives: Synthesis, antimicrobial activity
   evaluation and in silico studies
SO BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The development of new antimicrobial compounds is in high demand to overcome the emerging drug resistance against infectious microbial pathogens. In the present study, we carried out the extensive antimicrobial screening of disubstituted urea derivatives. In addition to the classical synthesis of urea compounds by the reaction of amines and isocyanates, we also applied a new route including bromination, oxidation and azidination reactions, respectively, to convert 2-amino-3-methylpyridine to 1,3-disubstituted urea derivatives using various amines. The evaluation of antimicrobial activities against various bacterial strains, Candida albicans as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis resulted in the discovery of new active molecules. Among them, two compounds, which have the lowest MIC values on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were further evaluated for their inhibition capacities of biofilm formation. In order to evaluate their potential mechanism of biofilm inhibition, these two compounds were docked into the active site of LasR, which is the transcriptional regulator of bacterial signaling mechanism known as quorum sensing. Finally, the theoretical parameters of the bioactive molecules were calculated to establish their drug-likeness properties.

TI Design of Fe-modified mesoporous nanostructures as efficient catalysts
   for microwave-assisted selective oxidations of sulfides
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Redox catalysts modified with Fe were synthesized via wet impregnation of metal species loaded on SBA-15. The influence of a number of Fe precursors with distinctive counter-ions on the deposited metal species was studied. Materials were characterized by XRD, N-2 physisorption, TEM, UV-vis DR, TPR and adsorption-desorption of pyridine followed by FT-IR. The redox properties were determined in the oxidation of diphenyl sulfide assisted by microwave irradiation. The reaction was carried out in ethanol as solvent and using Urea-H2O2 as oxidant, both chosen for their greener properties. Conversion and selectivity to diphenyl sulfoxide were found to be optimum when iron chlorides were employed as metal precursors in the synthesis. These iron sources led to the formation of nanoclusters in the surface, resulting in more available and exposed iron oxide sites and, in consequence, an enhanced oxidation potential and improved catalytic performance. Finally, these solids were reused after 4 reaction cycles without loss of their activity, corroborating in this way, the high stability of Fe species loaded into the silicate matrix.

TI Metal-organic-framework template-derived hierarchical porous CoP arrays
   for energy-saving overall water splitting
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Developing highly active and low-cost electrocatalysts with superior durability is attractive but challenging for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation via water electrolysis. Herein, a novel metal-organic framework (MOF)-based growth-etching-phosphorization strategy is reported to construct hierarchical porous CoP nanostructure arrays on nickel foam substrate (HP-CoP NA/NF) for overall water splitting (OWP). Interconnected 2D cobalt-based MOF are fabricated via an aqueous solution reaction at room temperature, and then solid MOFs are uniformly converted into porous CoP arrays with hierarchical 3D configuration through a Co2+-etching process with subsequent phosphorization treatment. This unique array architecture is beneficial for providing highly exposed active sites, shortening ion diffusion path and promoting gas release during the electrochemical reactions. Resultantly, this MOFs-derived CoP catalyst exhibits an outstanding electrocatalytic activity in catalyzing not only hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with the low overpotentials of 70 and 258 mV at 10 mA cm(2), respectively, but also some other small molecules electro-oxidation reactions, especially for urea oxidation reaction. Furthermore, the two-electrode electrolyzer comprising bifunctional HP-CoP NA/NF electrode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.38 V in the presence of urea, which is 180 mV smaller than that of pure water splitting. This work introduces a reference for the development of MOF-derived hierarchical nanostructured catalysts for energy-saving water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO PARTICULATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The urea-nitrate combustion and homogeneous precipitation methods have been comparatively examined for the preparation of CuO/CeO2/ZrO2/Al2O3 catalysts. Their physicochemical properties, as well as their hydrogen production ability via the steam reforming of methanol, have been studied. Prepared catalysts were characterized using XRD, FESEM, EDX, BET, and FTIR analyses. Characterization analyses and catalytic performance studies showed that the preparation method plays an important role in the synthesis of catalysts. XRD analysis showed that the homogeneous precipitation method can prepare catalyst with smaller copper crystallites and better surface dispersion compared with the combustion synthesis method. EDX results illustrated homogenous dispersion of elements. BET and FESEM showed the surface area improvement and lower size distribution, respectively, during synthesis of catalysts by the homogeneous precipitation method. Catalytic performance study also proved that catalyst prepared by the homogeneous precipitation method had better methanol conversion at all temperatures, whereas the sample fabricated by the urea-nitrate combustion synthesis method produces less CO. The stability test showed that the catalyst synthesized by the combustion synthesis method was quite stable for the steam reforming of methanol.

TI The construction of self- supported thorny leaf- like nickel- cobalt
   bimetal phosphides as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea
   electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Urea electrolysis offers the prospect of cost-effective and energy-saving hydrogen production together with mitigating urea-rich wastewater pollution instead of overall water splitting. Hence, here, high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts were developed for both the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via the in situ vertical growth of thorny leaf-like (2D nanosheets supporting 1D nanowires) NiCoP on a carbon cloth (NiCoP/CC). After integrating the advantages of the synergistic effect between Ni and Co as well as the unique hierarchical structure combined with 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets and a 3D conductive carbon cloth substrate, the electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward HER and UOR. The electrolytic cell assembled using NiCoP/CC as the anode and the cathode could provide current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.42 V (160 mV less than that for its urea-free counterpart) as well as remarkable durability over 30 h. Thus, the cost-effectiveness and high activity of the NiCoP/CC electrode pave the way to explore transition metal-based electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis.

TI g-C3N4 Coating Enhanced Cu@AC for Catalytic Wet
   Air Oxidation of Phenol under Mild Conditions
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB A Cu-based supported catalyst with g-C3N4 coating (Cu/g-C3N4@AC) was prepared by facile in-situ growth over activated carbon surface with urea and Cu(NO3)(2), and the catalytic performance for wet air oxidation of phenolic wastewater was investigated. The effects of different reaction conditions (catalyst, temperature, pressure and pH) were examined. The results show that under the catalysis of Cu/g-C3N4@AC phenol could be completely oxidized at 120 degrees C and 0.5 MPa O-2 with COD removal of 92.6 % (from 4883 mg/L to 361 mg/L). TEM, BET, XRD, FTIR and XPS characterizations showed that g-C3N4 coating could strengthen the metal surface interaction via the Cu-N-C bonds formation, thus suppressing the aggregation of the active components on the surface and mitigating the catalyst deactivation. Moreover, the interaction between the Cu species and the g-C3N4 structure facilitates the electron transfer and thus significantly boost up the catalytic activity. These findings help explore efficient catalysts for the wastewater treatment via wet air oxidation under mild conditions.

TI Nickel phosphate as advanced promising electrochemical catalyst for the
   electro-oxidation of methanol
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Mesoporous nickel phosphate nanotube (Meso NiPO NT) and mesoporous nickel phosphate nanosheet (Meso NiPO NS) are developed as catalysts for electrochemical methanol oxidation. Conventional mesoporous nickel phosphate which is composed of stacked nanocrystals (Meso NiPO), microporous VSB-5 and commercial nickel oxide (NiO) are used as control materials. Notably, both Meso NiPO NT (40.83 mA cm(-2)) and Meso NiPO NS (44.97 mA cm(-2)) exhibit much higher oxidation current density than VSB-5 (13.41 mA cm(-2)), Meso NiPO (19.85 mA cm(-2)) and commercial NiO (0.87 mA cm(-2)). As for the durability test on these materials modified fluorine-doped tin dioxide transparent conductive glass (FTO) electrodes, Meso NiPO NT displays the most stable performance and still retains 91.3% electrochemical activity, which perhaps benefit from its nanotube structure and large specific surface area (99.6 m(2)/g). Moreover, Meso NiPO NT has higher activity and more excellent stability than many of the previously reported nickel-based materials, suggesting a potential development for direct methanol fuel cells.

TI Immobilization of dioxomolybdenum(VI) Schiff base complex on graphene
   oxide nanosheets and its catalytic activity for oxidation of sulfides
SO JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY
AB Graphene oxide was an effective supporting material for immobilizing a dioxomolybdenum Schiff base complex via covalent interaction. The large surface of graphene oxide plays important roles to obtain a good degree of catalytic reaction. Catalytic capacity of the graphene-bound dioxomolybdenum Schiff base complex was investigated for the oxidation of various sulfides to sulfoxide compounds using hydrogen peroxide urea as an oxidant. The catalyst was characterized by various techniques including XRD, FTIR, TGA, SEM, UV-vis, and ICP-AES. The immobilized complex was very efficient with the extra benefits of easy recovery and recycling of the heterogeneous catalyst. The graphene oxide bound dioxomolybdenum Schiff base complex was reused for several runs without meaningful loss in catalytic activity.

TI Discovering ultrahigh loading of single-metal-atoms via surface
   tensile-strain for unprecedented urea electrolysis
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Single-atom-catalysts (SACs) have recently gained significant attention in energy conversion/storage applications, while the low-loading amount due to their easy-to-migrate tendency causes a major bottleneck. For energy-saving H-2 generation, replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with the thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers great promise, additionally mitigating the issue of urea-rich water contamination. However, the lack of efficient catalysts to overcome the intrinsically slow kinetics limits its scalable applications. Herein, we discover that incorporating tensile-strain on the surface of a Co3O4 (strained-Co3O4; S-Co3O4) support by the liquid N-2-quenching method can significantly inhibit the migration tendency of Rh single-atoms (Rh-SA), thereby stabilizing an similar to 200% higher loading of Rh-SA sites (Rh-SA-S-Co3O4; bulk loading similar to 6.6 wt%/surface loading similar to 11.6 wt%) compared to pristine-Co3O4 (P-Co3O4). Theoretical calculations revealed a significantly increased migration energy barrier of Rh-SA on the S-Co3O4 surface than on P-Co3O4, inhibiting their migration/agglomeration. Surprisingly, Rh-SA-S-Co3O4 exhibited exceptional pH-universal UOR activity, requiring record-low working potentials and surpassing Pt/Rh-C, this was due to superior urea adsorption and stabilization of CO*/NH* intermediates, revealed by DFT simulations. Meanwhile, the assembled urea-electrolyzer delivered 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.33 V with robust stability in alkaline media. This work provides a general methodology towards high-loading SACs for scalable applications.

TI Multifunctional iron-cobalt heterostructure (FeCoHS) electrocatalysts:
   accelerating sustainable hydrogen generation through efficient water
   electrolysis and urea oxidation
SO NANOSCALE
AB The urgent need to address escalating environmental pollution and energy management challenges has underscored the importance of developing efficient, cost-effective, and multifunctional electrocatalysts. To address these issues, we developed an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and multifunctional electrocatalyst via a solvothermal synthesis approach. Due to the merits of the ideal synthesis procedure, the FeCoHS@NF electrocatalyst exhibited multifunctional activities, like OER, HER, OWS, UOR, OUS, and overall alkaline seawater splitting, with required potentials of 1.48, 0.130, 1.59, 1.23, 1.40, and 1.54 V @ 10 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, electrolysers required only 1.40 V at 10 mA cm-2 for energy-saving urea-assisted hydrogen production, which was 190 mV lower than that of the alkaline water electrolyser. The alkaline sewage and seawater purification setup combined with the FeCoHS@NF electrolyzer led to a novel approach of producing pure green hydrogen and water. The ultrastability of the FeCoHS@NF electrocatalyst for industrial applications was confirmed using chronopotentiometry at 10 and 100 mA cm-2 over 110 h for OER, HER, UOR, and overall water splitting. The production of hydrogen using the FeCoHS@NF electrocatalyst in alkaline sewage water and seawater offers multiple benefits, including generation of renewable hydrogen energy, purification of wastewater, reduction of environmental pollutants, and low cost and low electricity consumption of the electrolyser system.

TI Copper and/or cobalt modified nanostructured Ce-Zr mixed oxides as
   efficient catalysts for ethyl acetate total oxidation
SO BULGARIAN CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB By using an original approach combining the utilization of urea as a precipitator followed by hydrothermal treatment were obtained nanostructured Ce-Zr mixed oxides (Ce/Zr = 3:7 or 5:5). The obtained oxides were modified with copper and/or cobalt via incipient wetness impregnation from the corresponding metal nitrates. The obtained materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, UV-Vis spectroscopy, temperatureprogrammed reduction (TPR) with hydrogen and their catalytic activity and selectivity in ethyl acetate oxidation was studied as well. The introduction of transition metal oxide within the parent Ce-Zr oxides decreases the start of the conversion with up to 50 K, increases substantially of the catalytic activity within the 550-650 K range and facilitates the selectivity to total oxidation of ethyl acetate. The influence of the type of modifying transition metal is better distinguished for the 3Ce7Zr support, especially within 550-600 K range, showing that the addition of copper only is sufficient for achieving the best catalytic results. At the same time, the support with higher ceria amount (5Ce5Zr) favors the catalytic behavior of the cobalt-containing modifications as well due to enhanced Co-Ce interaction.

TI The response of methanotrophs to additions of either ammonium, nitrate
   or urea in alpine swamp meadow soil as revealed by stable isotope
   probing
SO FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB Different forms of nitrogen (N) are deposited on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP), while their differential effects on soil methanotrophs and their activity remain elusive. We constructed microcosms amended with different N fertilizers (ammonia, nitrate and urea) using the soils sampled from a swamp meadow on the QTP. The responses of active methanotrophs to different forms of nitrogen were determined by stable isotope probing with 5% C-13-methane. At the early stage of incubation, all N fertilizers, especially urea, suppressed methane oxidation compared with the control. The methane oxidation rate increased during the incubation, suggesting an adaptation and stimulation of some methanotrophs to elevated methane. At the onset of the incubation, the type II methanotrophs Methylocystis were most abundant, but decreased during the incubation and were replaced by the type Ia methanotrophs Methylomonas. Ammonia and urea had similar effects on the methanotroph communities, both characterized by an elevation in the proportion of Methylobacter and more diverse methanotroph communities. Nitrate had less effect on the methanotroph community. Our results uncovered the active methanotrophs responding to different nitrogen forms, and suggested that urea-N might have large effects on methanotroph diversity and activity in swamp meadow soils on the QTP.

TI Fe-Doped CoNi layered hydrogencarbonate hierarchical Nano-Array assisted
   growth of ZIF-67 as an efficient OER/UOR bifunctional catalyst reaction
   for Overall Urea-Water electrolysis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The design of efficient electrocatalysts for OER and UOR is essential for achieving sustainable hydrogen production and enabling simultaneous wastewater treatment. Here, a versatile fabrication method for the in -situ growth of ZIF -67 from hydrocarbonate as a template for three-dimensional hierarchical nano-arrays. This strategy provides an opportunity for controllably tuning the interfacial assembly of MOFs materials on precursor template nanomaterials. The obtained MIM@Fe 0 . 1 -CoNi CH/NF exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic performance as an electrocatalytic anode for the OER and UOR. The MIM@Fe 0 . 1 -CoNi CH/NF required only 194 mV and 285 mV overpotentials to achieve the current densities of 10 and 100 mA & sdot; cm - 2 in the electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH, and the overpotentials in the 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M Urea electrolyte requires only 1.31 V (vs.RHE) to achieve a current density of 10 mA & sdot; cm - 2 . Notably, (+)MIM@Fe 0 . 1 -CoNi CH/NF || Pt/C/NF(-) achieves 10 mA & sdot; cm - 2 in ureaassisted electrolysis at only 1.36 V (vs.RHE). The excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the modification of the CoNi CH/NF template by Fe 3+ and 2-MIM, which modulated the Ni 2+ and Co 2+ electronic structures and optimised the adsorption behaviour of the OER/UOR intermediates. Overall, this work provides a strategy for preparing desirable catalysts for clean energy and wastewater treatment.

TI Production of a nickel-based catalyst for urea electrooxidation using
   spent batteries as raw material: Electrochemical synthesis and
   implications from a circular economy stand-point
SO SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this work, we leached the electrochemically active powder (black mass) from spent Ni-MH batteries in an aqueous solution containing citric add and hydrogen peroxide. The obtained multimetallic solution was chemically analyzed and its speciation simulated via thermodynamic software. Electrolysis of the leachate rendered a new metal coating containing Ni, Zn and Co on a copper substrate. The electrochemical stability of the alloycoated electrode was evaluated in a 1 M KOH solution through cyclic voltammetry analysis and compared against a pure-nickel electrode standard. Moreover, the catalytic capacity of the alloyed electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric analysis using a mixture of 1 M KOH and 0.3 M urea. During the electrooxidation of urea, the Ni-Zn-Co coated electrode exhibited better performance than the pure-nickel catalytic electrode used as standard, with a current response 1.8 times higher than pure nickel and 9.4% lower energy consumption than pure nickel. This promising result opens the possibility for targeting the manufacturing of catalytic electrodes as a viable end-user of the recovered metal values contained in spent batteries. As a result, a conceptual process flow diagram was devised for this novel valorization procedure. The application of these alloyed electrodes for the remediation of urea-containing water was conceptually proposed, as well. From a circular economy standpoint, this work describes an industrial ecosystem involving the life cycle of Ni-MH batteries, the electroplating industrial process, and the environmental services. Consequently, an innovative and symbiotic materials flow was depicted for wastewater treatment based on electrooxidation procedures. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A mixture of 1 and Pd(OAc)(2) in dimethyl sulfoxide provided a supramolecular gel after brief ultrasound irradiation. The supramolecular gel changed into a sol/solution upon addition of chelating agents such as diamines and bidentate phosphine ligands. Dissociation of the coordination bonds between 1 and the palladium ion via addition of a chelating agent caused the phase transition. The Wacker oxidation of styrene was performed in the supramolecular gel. The reaction in the gel phase required a longer induction period to produce acetophenone than did the reaction in the homogeneous solution.

TI MXene Electrocatalysts: Transformative Approaches in Hydrogen Production
   with Alternative Anode Reactions
SO SMALL
AB Water electrolyzer is crucial for producing clean hydrogen, but the traditional approach faces challenges owing to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) slow kinetics at the anode. Hybrid water splitting replaces the OER with the oxidation of an organic molecule to enhance hydrogen production along with value-added products. The scarcity of affordable and highly effective catalysts remains a major challenge. MXene, a 2D nanomaterial, has gained substantial attention for its enviable properties, for instance high conductivity, hydrophilicity, and substantial surface area. This review discusses experimental methods for synthesizing MXene and MXene-based nanocomposites. Furthermore, the small molecules oxidation such as benzyl alcohol, methanol, ethanol, urea, hydrazine, furfural, and formic acid as alternatives to the oxygen evolution reaction is examined. Finally, an understanding of imminent research and the development of MXene-associated materials in electrocatalytic applications are presented.

SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Development of anode catalysts and catalyst supporting carbonaceous material containing non-precious metal have attracted tremendous attention in the field of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs). Herein, we report the synthesis and electrochemical properties of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) supported Co, Ni and NiCo nanocomposites. The metal NRGO nanocomposites, in which metal nanoparticles are embedded in the highly porous nitrogen-doped graphene matrix, have been synthesized by simply and one-pot method at a mild temperature using GO, urea choline chloride and urea as reducing and doping agent. The fabricated NiCo/NRGO exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity (with Tafel slope of 159.1 mV dec(-1)) and high stability for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The superior performance of the alloy based NRGO is attributed to high surface area, well uniform distribution of high-density nitrogen, metal active sites and synergistic effect.

TI Steatogenesis in adult-onset type II citrullinemia is associated with
   down-regulation of PPARα
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE
AB SLC25A13 (citrin or aspartate glutamate carrier 2) is located in the mitochondrial membrane in the liver and its genetic deficiency causes adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). CTLN2 is one of the urea cycle disorders characterized by sudden-onset hyperammonemia due to reduced argininosuccinate synthase activity. This disorder is frequently accompanied with hepatosteatosis in the absence of obesity and ethanol consumption. However, the precise mechanism of steatogenesis remains unclear. The expression of genes associated with fatty add (FA) and triglyceride (TG) metabolism was examined using liver samples obtained from 16 CTLN2 patients and compared with 7 healthy individuals. Although expression of hepatic genes associated with lipogenesis and TG hydrolysis was not changed, the mRNAs encoding enzymes/proteins involved in FA oxidation (camitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1 alpha, medium-and very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, and acyl-CoA oxidase 1), very-low-density lipoprotein secretion (microsomal TG transfer protein), and FA transport (CD36 and FA-binding protein 1), were markedly suppressed in CTLN2 patients. Serum concentrations of ketone bodies were also decreased in these patients, suggesting reduced mitochondrial beta-oxidation activity. Consistent with these findings, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPAR alpha), a master regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism, was significantly down-regulated. Hepatic PPARa expression was inversely correlated with severity of steatosis and circulating ammonia and citrulline levels. Additionally, phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase was enhanced in CTLN2 livers, which was likely associated with lower hepatic PPAR alpha. Collectively, down-regulation of PPARa is associated with steatogenesis in CTLN2 patients. These findings provide a novel link between urea cycle disorder, lipid metabolism, and PPAR alpha.

TI Synthesis, structure, and Mossbauer spectroscopic studies on the
   heat-induced solid-phase redox reactions of hexakis(urea-O)iron(III)
   peroxodisulfate
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Anhydrous hexakis(urea-O)iron(III)]peroxydisulfate ([Fe(urea-O)(6)](2)(S2O8)(3) (compound 1), and its deuterated form were prepared and characterized with single-crystal X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic (IR, Raman, UV, and Mossbauer) methods. Six crystallographically different urea ligands coordinate via their oxygen in a propeller-like arrangement to iron(III) forming a distorted octahedral complex cation. The octahedral arrangement of the complex cation and its packing with two crystallographically different persulfate anions is stabilized by extended intramolecular (N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISO = C) and intermolecular (N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISO-S) hydrogen bonds. The two types of peroxydisulfate anions form different kinds and numbers of hydrogen bonds with the neighboring [hexakis(urea-O)(6)iron(III)](3+) cations. There are spectroscopically six kinds of urea and three kinds (2 + 1) of persulfate ions in compound 1, thus to distinguish the overlapping bands belonging to internal and external vibrational modes, deuteration of compound 1 and low-temperature Raman measurements were also carried out, and the bands belonging to the vibrational modes of urea and persulfate ions have been assigned. The thermal decomposition of compound 1 was followed by TG-MS and DSC methods in oxidative and inert atmospheres as well. The decomposition starts at 130 degrees C in inert atmosphere with oxidation of a small part of urea (similar to 1 molecule), which supports the heat demand of the transformation of the remaining urea into ammonia and biuret/isocyanate. The next step of decomposition is the oxidation of ammonia into N-2 along with the formation of SO2 (from sulfite). The main solid product proved to be (NH4)(3)Fe(SO4)(3) in air. In inert atmosphere, some iron(II) compound also formed. The thermal decomposition of (NH4)(3)Fe(SO4)(3) via NH4Fe(SO4)(2) formation resulted in alpha-Fe2O3. The decomposition pathway of NH4Fe(SO4)(2), however, depends on the experimental conditions. NH4Fe(SO4)(2) transforms into Fe-2(SO4)(3), N-2, H2O, and SO2 at 400 degrees C, thus the precursor of alpha-Fe2O3 is Fe-2(SO4)(3). Above 400 degrees C (at isotherm heating), however, the reduction of iron(III) centers was also observed. FeSO4 formed in 27 and 75% at 420 and 490 degrees C, respectively. FeSO4 also turns into alpha-Fe2O3 and SO2 on further heating.

TI Three-Dimensional Coral-Like NiFe-Layered Double Hydroxides on
   Biomass-Derived Nitrogen-Doped Carbonized Wood as a Sensitive Probe for
   Nonenzymatic Urea Determination
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Binder-less, self-standing, disposable, and cost-effective sensing probes are crucial for the development of next-generation nonenzymatic urea sensors (NEUSs). In the present study, three-dimensional (3D) coral-like NiFe-based layered double hydroxide (NF-LDH) microstructures were grown over the naturally inherited porous microchannels of nitrogen-doped carbonized wood (NCW). The microstructural details and chemical composition of the fabricated electrodes were examined by microscopic and spectral methods. The formation of novel 3D coral-like microarchitectures with uniformly enveloped nanoflakes was evidenced from the scanning electron microscopy measurements. Interestingly, NF-LDH exhibited a voltammetric response for urea due to the unique 3D architecture and synergistic influence between catalytically active Ni3+ sites and doped Fe3+ centers. Here, NCW serves as a catalyst-docking platform and electron-conducting medium. Such direct anchoring of catalytically active structures on conductive scaffolds eliminates the electron transfer resistance provoked by stereotypical insulating binders. Furthermore, the growth of the NF-LDH catalyst on NCW was varied with respect to the mole ratio of Ni3+ and Fe3+. Among the different mole ratios, the NF-LDH catalyst modified with Ni/Fe-0.75:0.25 showed the best sensing performance toward urea with a sensitivity of 53 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), a wide linear range from 0.5 to 8 mM, and a limit of detection of 0.114 mM (S/N = 3) in addition to exceptional stability and reproducibility.

TI Lattice-Refined Transition-Metal Oxides via Ball Milling for Boosted
   Catalytic Oxidation Performance
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Surface oxygen vacancy can greatly affect the properties of transition-metal oxides. However, engineering oxygen vacancy-abundant transition-metal oxides with high specific surface area (SSA) remains challenging. At present, the generation of oxygen vacancies in metal oxides is time-consuming and less environmentally friendly by chemical leaching methods that usually require additional waste treatment. Herein, a series of oxygen vacancy-abundant transition-metal oxides with high SSA are constructed via a lattice refining strategy. This strategy is realized by urea-assisted ball milling pyrolysis and is green, efficient, and universal. The oxygen vacancies promote the mobility of oxygen, leading to a boosted catalytic oxidation performance of aromatic sulfides. Such a strategy provides an efficient approach to manufacturing oxygen vacancies on transition-metal oxides, which may be beneficial for various related applications as an effective catalytic material.

TI MoP@NiCo-LDH on nickel foam as bifunctional electrocatalyst for high
   efficiency water and urea-water electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Water electrolysis is an important way to produce hydrogen at the cathode, but the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode has a high overpotential. Using the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to replace OER has been an energy-saving approach for its lower electrode potential, and also a potential approach for wastewater treatment. In this paper, novel materials of MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-x(x= 10, 20, 30 minutes) are synthesized and explored as bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anodes of urea-water or water electrolysis. The morphologies and compositions of such catalyst materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The catalytic activity and stability are measured by linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry,etc.The results indicate that MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-20 has better catalytic performance, and can be used as a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER/UOR in the electrolysis. A two-electrode electrolyser (MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-20||MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-20) is constructed. At 100 mA cm(-2), the two-electrode electrolyser needs only 1.405 V, while the precious metal electrolyser Pt/C/NF||IrO2/NF needs 1.697 V at the same current density, indicating that MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-20 could be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst in water and urea-water electrolysis for the treatment of urea wastewater and hydrogen production.

TI Urine Treatment in a Stacked Membraneless Direct Urea Fuel Cell with
   Honeycomb-like Nickel-Molybdenum Bimetal Phosphide as the Anodic
   Electrocatalyst
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB The aim of this study was to synthesize a novel catalyst for urea oxidation and to test a stacked membraneless direct urea fuel cell (DUFC) with raw urine as fuel. The molybdenum nickel phosphides on nickel foam (MoNiP/NF) were synthesized using a combined hydrothermal and phosphating method. The honeycomb-like MoNiP/NF catalyst with a Mo/Ni molar ratio of 0.50 (i.e., MoNiP/NF-0.50) showed the highest electrocatalytic activity for urea oxidation among different catalysts. The stacked membraneless DUFC was constructed using the MoNiP/NF-0.50 electrode as anode and a gas diffusion cathode. With the electrode spacing of 5 mm and 6 electrode pairs, the stacked membraneless DUFC had a maximum voltage of 0.55 V and a power density of 0.115 mW cm(-2) at the external resistance of 1000 Omega, at which the power output was 5.32 times higher than that in the individual membraneless DUFC. The urea removal reached 65.8% in the cell at the external resistance of 100 Omega within 192 h. The excellent performance of the cell could be attributed to the high activity of the MoNiP/NF-0.50 catalyst, small electrode spacing, and multiple electrode pairs. Our results should provide promising potential for scalable DUFC with efficient urine treatment.

TI Engineering high-valence nickel sites in
   Ni3S2/Ni3Se2 architectures
   enabling urea-assisted hydrogen evolution reactions
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB A more thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation reaction should be used instead of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to avoid high power consumption. Implementing this technology requires the development of stable, highly efficient, and inexpensive electrocatalysts. This study reports the synthesis of a heterogeneous catalyst composed of Ni3S2 nanowires and Ni3Se2 nanosheets on nickel foam (Ni3S2@Ni3Se2/NF) using hydrothermal in situ growth and electrodeposition. The prepared Ni3S2@Ni3Se2/NF heterostructures demonstrate excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activities. The structural transformation and surface material changes of Ni3S2@Ni3Se2/NF during the UOR were observed using the in situ Raman method. The results reveal that the reconfiguration of the Ni-based catalyst is more intense and stronger in the UOR process, producing more Ni2+-O (beta-Ni(OH)2) and thereby generating more Ni3+-O (gamma-NiOOH) via electrochemical oxidation. Furthermore, compared to other catalysts recently described, when Ni3S2@Ni3Se2/NF was used as both the anode and cathode in the battery, it only required a low 1.45 V voltage to attain a current density of 10 mA cm-2. This work is a solid basis for producing hydrogen with low energy consumption from urea-assisted hydrogen evolution.

TI The effect of non-selective oxidation on the
   Mn2Co1Ox catalysts for
   NH3-SCR: Positive and non-positive
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In order to explore the generation of NO2 and N2O on the Mn-Co catalysts in the NH3-SCR process, Mn2Co1Ox (PEG) and Mn2Co1Ox (PA) catalysts, prepared by two different complexing agents, i.e., polyethylene glycol (PEG) and urea as double complexing agents, and ammonia (PA), were further investigated by NO + O-2 and NH3 + O-2 experiments, besides NH3-SCR test. Catalytic activity and physicochemical properties of the catalysts were compared and analyzed through NH3-TPD, O-2-TPD, H-2-TPR, XRD, Raman and XPS. The NH3-SCR results show that the Mn2Co1Ox(PEG) exhibits higher NO conversion than Mn2Co1Ox (PA) due to larger amount of lattice oxygen accompanied with more Con+ , and surface adsorbed oxygen species, as well as the improvement of surface acidity, proved by O-2-TPD, XPS and NH3-TPD, respectively. Furthermore, the separate oxidation experiments show that Mn2Co1Ox (PEG) effectively exhibits the oxidation of NH3 to N2O and also the oxidation of NO to NO2 by O-2 respectively, which can influence the catalytic performance. The XRD, XPS and Raman characterization results indicate that Mn2Co1Ox(PEG) contains more Co3O4 than Mn2Co1Ox(PA), that can produce non-selective pure oxidation reaction by the NO + O-2 and NH3 + O-2 experiments of Co3O4 phase. Information from in situ infrared experiments is that the strongly adsorbed NH3 species on the Mn2Co1Ox(PEG) is susceptible to deep dehydrogenation and react with NOx to produce N2O in the presence of O-2. Meanwhile, the oxidation site (Co3O4) can also oxidize NO to more NO2, thereby improving the "fast SCR" reaction. However, if the proportion of oxidation sites is high, NO and NH3 can be oxidized to more N2O will be produced by the reaction between NO and NH3.

TI Assembly of low-crystalline triple-phase NiCoSx nanospheres
   for efficient hydrogen production via urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB It is highly desired to design high-performance electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) that can be utilized for hydrogen production from urea-containing water, although this remains a significant challenge. In this study, low-crystalline NiCoSx nanospheres derived from 2D NiCo-BDC-MeIM nanosheets arrays (lc-NCSx/C-NC-BM) grown on nickel foam were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method for UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In contrast to the high-crystalline catalyst (hc-NCSx/C-NC-BM), the lc-NCSx/C-NC-BM possessed a multitude of unsaturated coordination sites with disordered atomic arrangements, thereby enhancing reactant adsorption, accelerating ion diffusion and facilitating charge transfer. Leveraging these characteristics, the as-prepared lc-NCSx/C-NC-BM demonstrated significantly enhanced UOR activity (E-10/100= 1.2/1.33 V) and HER activity (E-10/-100= -65/-222 mV) in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea solution. This study presents a rational approach for synthesizing low-crystalline materials, which is crucial for efficient and stable hydrogen production by using urea-containing wastewater.

TI Synthesis of Ni decorated MoOx nanorod catalysts for
   efficient overall urea-water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Substituting slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is considered as one of the feasible strategies for achieving energy-saving hydrogen production. Herein, a uniform layer of NiMoO4 nanorods was grown on nickel foam by a hydrothermal method. Then, a series of Ni-MoOx/NF-X nanorod catalysts comprising Ni/NiO and MoOx (MoO2/MoO3) were prepared through regulating annealing atmosphere and reduction temperature. The optimized Ni-MoOx/NF-3 with a large accessible specific area can act as a bifunctional catalyst for electrocatalytic anodic UOR and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), the introduction of urea can significantly reduce the overpotential of Ni-MoOx/NF-3 by 210 mV compared to OER. In addition, Ni-MoOx/NF-3 has a higher intrinsic activity than other catalysts. It only requires -0.21 and 1.38 V to reach 100 mA cm(-2) in HER and UOR, respectively. Such an excellent performance can be attributed to the synergistic function between Ni and MoOx. The presence of metallic Ni and reduced MoOx in pairs is beneficial for improving the electrical conductivity and modulating the electronic structure, resulting in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. When assembling Ni-MoOx/NF-3 into an overall urea-water splitting system, it can achieve energy-saving hydrogen production and effective removal of urea-rich wastewater.

TI AES and XPS Analysis on Hydrogen Permeation Barrier Formed by Reaction
   between Urea and Zirconium Hydride at High Temperature
SO RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
AB Hydrogen permeation barriers were prepared by the chemical reaction between urea and zirconium hydride at high temperature. The composition and depth of elements, bond state were analyzed by auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). AES results indicate that the barrier is mainly composed of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and zirconium, whose thickness is about 3.4 mu m, including 150 nm of nitrogen and carbon. The atomic concentration of carbon and nitrogen decreases continuously, while the content of oxygen and zirconium increases with longer sputtering time. XPS shows that the barrier contains ZrO2 as well as Zr-OH, Zr-N, C-H and N-H bonds. The mechanism of hydrogen resistance may be that hydrogen is captured by carbon, nitrogen and oxygen to form C-H, N-H and O-H bonds, respectively, when it diffuses from zirconium hydrides. Therefore, the prepared coatings can prevent hydrogen permeation effectively.

TI Partial oxidation of alkanes by dioxiranes formed in situ at low
   temperature
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Partial oxidation catalysts capable of efficiently operating at low temperatures may limit the over-oxidation of alkane substrates and thereby improve selectivity. This work focuses on examining alkane oxidation using completely metal-free organocatalysts, dioxiranes. The dioxiranes employed here are synthesized by oxidation of a ketone using a terminal oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide. Our work generates the dioxirane in situ, so that the process can be catalytic with respect to the ketone. To date, we have demonstrated selective partial oxidation of adamantane using ketone catalysts resulting in yields upwards of 60% towards 1-adamantanol with greater than 99% selectivity. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that changing the electrophilic character of the ketone R groups to contain more electron-donating ligands facilitates the dioxirane ring formation and improves overall oxidation yields. Isotopic labelling studies using H-2 O-18(2) show the preferential incorporation of an O-18 label into the parent ketone, providing evidence for a dioxirane intermediate formed in situ. The isotopic labelling studies, along with solvent effect studies, suggest the formation of peracetic acid as a reactive intermediate.

TI NiPt Nanocatalysts Supported on Boron and Nitrogen Co-Doped Graphene for
   Superior Hydrazine Dehydrogenation and Methanol Oxidation
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB Boron and nitrogen co-doped graphene (BNG) with negligible covalent boron-nitride (BN) bonding, and high boron and pyridinic nitrogen contents has been synthesized by a two-step method using boron-carbon-nitride (BCN) as the boron and nitrogen sources. The use of the BCN precursor is the key for preparing BNG, while annealing reduced graphene oxide, urea, and boric acid in a one-step method results in separated domains of larger amounts of covalent BN in the graphene networks (s-BNG). The resulting BNGs are further used to anchor NiPt nanoparticles (NPs) with good dispersion. Consequently, Ni3Pt7/BNG-1000 exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward hydrazine dehydrogenation at room temperature, with the turnover frequency of 199.4h(-1). Furthermore, as evidence of its multifunctionality, Ni3Pt7/BNG-1000 is further employed for electrocatalytic methanol oxidation.

TI Synthesis, crystal structure and catalytic activity of an oxo-diperoxo
   tungsten(VI) complex containing an oxazine ligand for selective
   oxidation of sulfides
SO JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY
AB A novel oxo-diperoxo tungsten(VI) complex, [WO(O-2)(2)(Hphox)], was prepared by reaction of WO3 in H2O2 with an oxazine-type ligand, 2-(2 '-hydroxylphenyl)oxazine (Hphox). The complex was characterized by FTIR, H-1 NMR and elemental analysis. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed a seven-coordinate tungsten center with a distorted octahedral geometry. The [WO(O-2)(2)(Hphox)] complex was applied as a catalyst in efficient and selective oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide using 30% H2O2 or UHP (urea hydrogen peroxide) as oxidants. This catalyst showed excellent catalytic activities and high selectivities in producing a variety of aryl and alkyl sulfoxides under mild conditions. To get an insight into the mechanisms of oxidation of sulfides, the mechanistic studies were monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy.

TI Some Attributes of Mn<SUP>3+</SUP> Sites in Nickel-Based Layered Double
   Hydroxides during Methanol Electro-oxidation in Alkaline Media
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Ni-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs), or hydrotalcite-like materials (HTs), were synthetized through co-precipitation at constant pH (NiAl and NiMg) and urea hydrolysis (NiMn) methods, and they were tested in the electrochemical methanol oxidation (MOR). The physicochemical properties were explored by using techniques such as X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, as well as electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, correlation between active site arrangements and electrocatalytic activity was evidenced by density functional calculations. Specific site mu(Ni2Mn-OH) showed the lowest proton energy removal at approximately 3.6 eV and the NiMn LDH sample containing a higher proportion of this site exhibited the best performance for the MOR process, with an enhancement factor of 5.16, which is attributed to limited deactivation of Ni during the reaction. CO2 production was detected by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to be on the order of ten times greater than O-2.

   phenols in water
SO COMPTES RENDUS CHIMIE
AB A biomimetic heterogeneous catalyst was prepared by immobilization of meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrinatoiron(III) chloride (Fe(TCPP)CI) on multiwalled carbon nano tubes (MWCNTs). The anchored catalyst was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet visible, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The amount of Fe-porphyrin loaded on the nanotubes was estimated by atomic absorption spectroscopy The thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that the catalyst was thermally stable up to almost 350 degrees C, exhibiting high thermal stability. Oxidation of sulfides and phenols with urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) in water was efficiently enhanced with excellent selectivity under the influence of [Fe(TCPP)CI@MWCNT]. The title heterogeneous catalytic system facilitates a greener reaction because the reaction solvent is water and UHP is used as a safe oxidant. (C) 2017 Academie des sciences.

TI Restricted nitrous oxide emissions by ammonia oxidizers in two
   agricultural soils following excessive urea fertilization
SO JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB Purpose Nitrogen (N) fertilizer placement in bands is a widely accepted agricultural practice to increase N use efficiency. An excessive ammonium concentration in a fertilizer band can increase osmotic stress on ammonia oxidizers and potentially affect nitrification and resultant nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which is of great significance for soil function and climate change. The objectivity of this study was to identify the effects of excessive ammonium concentration on N2O emissions and ammonia oxidizers in two agricultural soils. Materials and methods In this study, we established a 56-day soil microcosm receiving a series of high concentrations of urea at 600, 900, and 1200 mg N kg(-1) (termed as N600, N900, and N1200, respectively), which simulated high ammonium levels in the center or proximity of a fertilizer band in two types of agricultural soils (fluvo-aquic soil and anthrosol). The mineral N concentrations, net nitrification rate, and N2O emissions were measured during the incubation. In addition, the abundances of bacterial and archaeal amoA were determined by using real-time quantitative PCR. Results and discussion Urea fertilization simultaneously increased the net nitrification rate and N2O emission at the early stage of incubation in both soils, suggesting N2O production was mainly from ammonia oxidation. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) but not archaea (AOA) abundance was stimulated following urea fertilization and was positively correlated with N2O emission, indicating the dominant role of AOB in ammonia oxidation and N2O production in fertilized soils. The cumulative N2O emission was significantly higher in N1200 and N900 than N600 in both soils, but no further increase was observed in N1200 in the anthrosol. This implies restricted N2O production of ammonia oxidizers at excessive ammonium concentrations in the anthrosol. In the two soils treated with no N addition, the abundances of AOA amoA increased along the incubation time. Conclusions The present study collectively suggested that excessive urea-N addition was more effective in inhibiting N2O emission in the anthrosol than in the fluvo-aquci soil. AOB rather than AOA dominated the soil nitrification and N2O emissions under high N addition in both soils. The band fertilization regime may reduce the loss of N fertilizer from nitrification without necessarily increasing N2O emissions.

TI 3D flower-like Ni-Co-S with high specific surface area for the
   electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol
SO POLYHEDRON
AB The 3D flower-like Ni-Co-S was synthesized by a typical hydrothermal method in the presence of urea and thioacetamide. As comparison, the urchin-like Ni-Co-O was prepared in the absence of thioacetamide. The former processed higher electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation than the latter. Ni-Co-S exhibited the anodic peak current density of 19.23 mA/cm(2) for methanol oxidation, far higher than Ni-Co-O. It also showed the Tafel slopes of 57 mV/dec, much lower than Ni-Co-O. The BET results showed that the surface area and pore volume are 96.373 m(2)/g and 0.367 cm(3)/g for the flower-like Ni-Co-S, which is higher than 88.736 m(2)/g and 0.224 cm(3)/g for the urchin-like Ni-Co-O. As a result, the flower-like Ni-Co-S possessed more electroactive sites for methanol oxidation. The superhydrophobicity of the flower-like Ni-Co-S helps for the formation of micro air film on the surface of flower petals. Such a tri-phase interface of Ni-Co-S solid, reaction solution and air film may help for the electrocatalytic oxidation of Ni-Co-S toward methanol oxidation since the produced CO2 can leave the surface of Ni-Co-S quickly and enter into solution phase due to the presence of air film and high solubility of CO2 in aqueous solution.

TI Plasmon-enhanced hierarchical photoelectrodes with mechanical
   flexibility for hydrogen generation from urea solution and human urine
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB We have demonstrated plasmon-enhanced flexible and hierarchical photoanodes for hydrogen production from human urine in a photoelectrochemical cell. The photoanodes consist of cobalt-doped alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays functionalized with Au nanoparticles and Ni(OH)(2). The Au nanoparticles and Ni(OH)(2) work as plasmonic nanostructures and urea oxidation catalyst, respectively. Benefiting from the plasmonic and catalytic effects, the photoanodes exhibit an AM 1.5 photocurrent of 5.00.1 mA cm(-2) (urea solution) and 7.5 +/- 0.1 mA cm(-2) (human urine) at 0.3 V versus Ag/AgCl. At a Pt counter electrode, continuous hydrogen gas evolution is achieved at a small bias. With their high performance and mechanical flexibility that facilitates the large-scale transportation and implementation in the field, the photoanodes are paving a sustainable way towards hydrogen production and urine treatment.

TI Porous NiO Nanosheet Bifunctional Electrodes Modified with Ultrafine
   Ni3S2 Quantum Dots for Green Hydrogen Production via Urea Electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Electrolysis of urea can simultaneously produce molecular hydrogen and alleviate the environmental problems caused by urea-rich wastewater effluents. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop low-cost, highly active, and resistant electrodes and electrocatalysts to achieve high-efficiency urea electrolysis processes. In this study, porous NiO nanosheets (NiO/ Ni3S2/NF) decorated with Ni3S2 quantum dots were prepared on the surface of nickel foam (NF) via the Kirkendall effect by the gas phase vulcanization reaction. The obtained NiO/Ni3S2/NF exhibits good electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An electrolyzer containing NiO/Ni3S2/NF||NiO/Ni3S2/ NF on both the anode and cathode, immersed in an alkaline aqueous solution containing urea, is assembled, and only a cell voltage of 1.408 V is required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2, a value which is much lower than that for an electrolyzer made of RuO2/NF||Pt/C/NF (1.490 V). It is found that the superior catalytic performance of NiO/Ni3S2/NF is mainly attributed to the uniform pore structure on NiO nanosheets and the synergistic effect between Ni3S2 quantum dots and NiO nanosheets. This study provides a method to simultaneously construct the porous structure and heterostructure through gas-phase reactions.

TI A practical non-enzymatic urea sensor based on
   NiCo2O4 nanoneedles
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB We propose a new facile electrochemical sensing platform for determination of urea, based on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with nickel cobalt oxide (NiCo2O4) nanoneedles. These nanoneedles are used for the first time for highly sensitive determination of urea with the lowest detection limit (1 mu M) ever reported for the non-enzymatic approach. The nanoneedles were grown through a simple and low-temperature aqueous chemical method. We characterized the structural and morphological properties of the NiCo2O4 nanoneedles by TEM, SEM, XPS and XRD. The bimetallic nickel cobalt oxide exhibits nanoneedle morphology, which results from the self-assembly of nanoparticles. The NiCo2O4 nanoneedles are exclusively composed of Ni, Co, and O and exhibit a cubic crystalline phase. Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the enhanced electrochemical properties of a NiCo2O4 nanoneedle-modified GCE by overcoming the typical poor conductivity of bare NiO and Co3O4. The GCE-modified electrode is highly sensitive towards urea, with a linear response (R-2 = 0.99) over the concentration range 0.01-5 mM and with a detection limit of 1.0 mu M. The proposed non-enzymatic urea sensor is highly selective even in the presence of common interferents such as glucose, uric acid, and ascorbic acid. This new urea sensor has good viability for urea analysis in urine samples and can represent a significant advancement in the field, owing to the simple and cost-effective fabrication of electrodes, which can be used as a promising analytical tool for urea estimation.

TI High-Density NiCu Bimetallic Phosphide Nanosheet Clusters Constructed by
   Cu-Induced Effect Boost Total Urea Hydrolysis for Hydrogen Production
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The development of urea electrolysis technologies toward energy-saving hydrogen production can alleviate the environmental issues caused by urea-rich wastewater. In the current practices, the development of high -performance electrocatalysts in urea electrolysis remains critical. In this work, the NiCu-P/NF catalyst is prepared by anchoring Ni/Cu bimetallic phosphide nanosheets onto Ni foam (NF). In the experiments, the micron-sized elemental Cu polyhedron is first anchored on the surface of the NF substrate to provide more space for the growth of bimetallic nanosheets. Meanwhile, the Cu element adjusted the electron distribution within the composite and formed Ni/P orbital vacancies, which in turn accelerated the kinetic process. As a result, the optimal NiCu-P/NF sample exhibits excellent catalytic activity and cycling stability in a hybrid electrolysis system for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Further, the alkaline urea-containing electrolyzer is assembled with NiCu-P/NF as two electrodes reached a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with a low driving potential of 1.422 V, which outperforms the typical commercial noble metal electrolyzer (RuO2||Pt/C). Those findings suggest the feasibility of the substrate regulation strategy to increase the growth density of active species in preparation of an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for cracking the urea-containing wastewater.

TI Cu-induced NiCu-P and NiCu-Pi with multilayered nanostructures as highly
   efficient electrodes for hydrogen production via urea
   electrolysis
SO NANOSCALE
AB Since urea is commonly present in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater, its use in hydrogen production by electrolysis can simultaneously help in water decontamination. To achieve this goal, the development of highly active and inexpensive urea electrolysis catalysts is necessary. This study deals with the preparation of multilayered nickel and copper phosphides/phosphates (NiCu-P/NF and NiCu-Pi/NF) supported on Ni foam (NF) and their application as new electrocatalyst types for the electrolysis of urea-containing wastewaters. In these materials, Cu atoms induce the formation of multilayer nanostructures and modulate electron distribution, allowing for the exposure of additional active sites and acceleration of the process kinetics. NiCu-P/NF is used as a cathode and NiCu-Pi/NF as an anode in an electrolysis cell and exhibits significant catalytic activity and stability in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The NiCu-Pi/NF||NiCu-P/NF electrolysis cell, operating with an alkaline urea-containing aqueous electrolyte, achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-) at a potential of 1.41 V, which is less than required by the RuO2||Pt/C cell utilizing commercial noble metal-based electrodes. The study provides a novel strategy for designing efficient catalysts to produce hydrogen by urea electrolysis.

SO CATALYSIS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a potential platform chemical in polymer industry for manufacturing polyester, polyamides and polyurethanes. Here, we introduced Li2CoMn3O8 as an efficient catalyst for the selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) to FDCA with 80% isolated yield in a gram scale reaction. The nanocrystalline spinel Li2CoMn3O8 catalyst was synthesized by gel pyrolysis method using urea and citric acid as complexing agent. The catalyst was characterized using PXRD, BET, ICP-MS and TEM. The catalyst is cheap and easy to prepare. The use of naturally abundant oxygen as oxidant results to high isolated product yield making this procedure scalable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI Nanomolar-Potency 1,2,4-Triazoloquinoxaline Inhibitors of the Kidney
   Urea Transporter UT-A1
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Urea transporter A (UT-A) isoforms encoded by the 100 Slc14a2 gene are expressed in kidney tubule epithelial cells, where they facilitate urinary concentration. UT-Al inhibition is predicted to produce a unique salt-sparing diuretic action in edema and hyponatremia. Here we report the discovery of 1,2,4-triazoloquinoxalines and the analysis of 37 synthesized analogues. The most potent compound, 8ay, containing 1,2,4triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline-substituted benzenesulfonamide linked by an aryl ether, rapidly and reversibly inhibited UT-Al urea transport by a noncompetitive mechanism with IC50 approximate to 150 nM; the IC50 was similar to 2 / mu M for the related urea transporter UT-B encoded by the Slc14a1 gene. Molecular modeling suggested a putative binding site on the UT-Al cytoplasmic domain. In vitro metabolism showing quinoxaline ring oxidation prompted the synthesis of metabolically stable 7,8-difluoroquinoxaline analogue 8bl, which when administered to rats produced marked diuresis and reduced urinary osmolality. 8bl has substantially improved UT-Al inhibition potency and metabolic stability compared with prior compounds.

TI Unprecedented urea oxidation on Zn@Ni-MOF with an ultra-high current
   density: understanding the competition between UOR and OER, catalytic
   activity limitation and reaction selectivity
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been extensively studied as an alternative to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for energy-efficient hydrogen generation. However, the detrimental competition between the UOR and OER limits the UOR current density to less than 500 mA cm(-2) and ultimately switches the reaction toward the OER. In this study, we attempted to gain a fundamental understanding of the catalytic activity limitation for the UOR and the possible factors influencing the reaction selectivity employing Ni-MOF as an example. The study showed that upon doping the Ni-lattices of the framework with Zn, the factors influencing the detrimental competition, such as the mass and charge transport ability of the MOF catalyst could be enhanced and the formation of the catalytically active Ni3+-OOH phase could be accelerated. This populated Zn@Ni-MOF with Ni3+-OOH sites, and subsequently prevented the detrimental competition between the anodic reactions. Consequently, Zn@Ni-MOF demonstrated an outstanding ultra-high UOR current density of 1780 mA cm(-2) at a low electrode potential of 1.52 V vs. RHE and the benchmark current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at a lower electrode potential of 1.31 and 1.32 V vs. RHE, respectively, hence outperforming most of the high-performance UOR catalysts.

TI Active Site Tailoring of Ni-Based Coordination Polymers for
   High-Efficiency Dual-Functional HER and UOR Catalysis
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Ni-based electrocatalysts are regarded as highly promising ones for urea-assisted electrolytic water hydrogen production technology. However, during the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) process, their activity is significantly constrained by the unavoidable Ni species self-oxidation reaction, and the harmful liquid-phase products (NOx-) generated from over-oxidize urea are also often neglected. Herein, A self-supported W-doped Ni-C3S3N3-based coordination polymer electrode (W-NT@NF) with tailored Ni3+ active sites using ligand anchoring and high-valence metal doping strategies is synthesized, which is certified that this pyrolysis-free catalyst achieves dual-functional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR performance comparable to reported noble metal/non-noble metal catalysts, both achieving high current densities approaching 1000 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, combined with spectroscopic characterizations that record the dynamic evolution of the catalyst during UOR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes, reveal that the novel and energetically favorable UOR pathway is proposed, which initiates directly by the Ni3+ sites without self-oxidation and involve the participation of the reconstructed NiOOH species resulting from OER. A combination of in-line gas chromatography, and ion chromatography analysis indicates that the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of N-2 is higher (34%) at lower current densities (<100 mA cm(-2)), and the FE of NOx- remains below 20% in long-term electrolysis.

TI Novel Eco-Friendly Electrode: Copper Nanoparticle-Doped MWCNTs for Green
   Electro-Organic Synthesis of 1,2,3-Triazoles With ChCl/Urea as a Solvent
   and Cocatalyst
SO APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY
AB Meticulous electrode design is pivotal in advancing greener and more sustainable electro-organic synthesis practices. In this research, our team designed and synthesized a copper-doped electrode on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and characterized it using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. Subsequently, this electrode was utilized as a catalyst at the electrode surface, serving as a cathode in electro-oxidation reactions in the presence of phenylacetylene, sodium azide (NaN3), and benzyl halide for the production of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives under ambient temperature, within a 30-min reaction time, and at atmospheric pressure, achieving an efficiency level ranging from good to excellent, specifically between 88% and 96%. The synthesized 1,2,3-triazole derivatives were identified using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, CHN elemental analysis, and melting point. In this paper, choline chloride/urea deep eutectic solvents (DES) serve multiple roles in the reaction mechanism. They function as solvents and co-catalysts, generate weak bases, and provide numerous advantages in green chemistry. These advantages include low toxicity, reduced environmental risks, improved atom economy, and non-volatility, making them safer alternatives to traditional organic solvents.
   This study presents an eco-friendly electrode, consisting of copper nanoparticle (NP)-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), for green electro-organic synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles. Choline chloride/urea acts as both a deep eutectic solvent (DES) and cocatalyst, facilitating efficient and selective synthesis in a sustainable manner.image

TI Self-Supported Nickel Phosphide Electrode for Efficient Alkaline
   Water-to-Hydrogen Conversion via Urea Electrolysis
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Electrochemical water splitting is an attractive technique to produce renewable hydrogen gas. However, considerable challenges remain before the catalytic anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can occur at a satisfactory rate due to its sluggish kinetics, thus hampering the overall efficiency of this technology. Urea electrolysis provides opportunities for energy-conserving hydrogen production and the concurrent remediation of urea-enriched sewage water. Therefore, developing advanced electrocatalysts with a reduced cost and improved efficiency for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is key to the implementation of this technique. Herein, we present a three-dimensional (3D) self-supported nickel phosphide/Ni foam electrode (P-NF) that can be prepared by adopting a straightforward low-temperature phosphorization treatment of commercially available Ni foam. As a result, compared with the pristine Ni foam, the as-prepared 3D P-NF catalyst presents obviously enhanced activity for the electrocatalytic UOR, and a small potential of 1.32 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When the P-NF electrode is employed to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it shows equally satisfactory performance. Moreover, a two-electrode electrolyzer system made of the as-obtained P-NF as the bifunctional electrocatalyst can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.37 V with remarkable operational stability.

TI Mechanism of the Reaction between HNCO and CaO in the Urea-Selective
   Non-catalytic Reduction deNOx Process
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB CaO decreased the performance of the urea-selective non-catalytic reduction deNO(x) process by affecting the conversion of urea pyrolysis products. The effect of CaO on HNCO conversion was studied in a pyrolysis/gas-solid reaction system along with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. CaO was found to react with HNCO, and HNCO conversion and product selectivity changed with the temperature and O-2. Mechanism analysis showed that CaO first reacted with HNCO to produce Ca(NCO)(2). Ca(NCO)(2) decomposed to CaCN2 and CO, at high temperatures. CaCN2 stably existed because of its high thermal stability. In the presence of O-2, Ca(NCO)(2) decomposed and was also oxidized to CaO, N2O, and CO2. In addition, produced CaCN2 was oxidized to CaO, NO, and CO. CaO was reproduced in Ca(NCO)(2) and CaCN2 oxidation; thus, the reaction between CaO and HNCO was accelerated and HNCO conversion was increased. The selectivity of products was determined by Ca(NCO)(2) decomposition, Ca(NCO)(2) oxidation, and CaCN2 oxidation.

TI Sulfurization-induced lattice disordering in high-entropy catalyst for
   promoted bifunctional electro-oxidation behavior
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The electro-oxidation reactions (EORs) are key half reactions to achieve efficient hydrogen production via direct or assisted water electrolysis, and the development of bifunctional EOR catalysts could further broaden the field of utilization and thus realize simultaneous hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. In this work, we proposed a mild sulfurization approach to fabricate a high-entropy septenary NiCrFeCoCuMnZn sulfide catalyst with unique sulfurization-induced lattice disordering. The disordered lattice and high-entropy feature of the preoxidation-favorable sulfide catalyst synergistically lead to enriched active sites and improved intrinsic activity towards promoted activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Dynamic analyses of the catalyst in EOR operation reveals that the enrichment of high-valence active species, increased surface roughness and the in-situ formed SO4 2- ions adsorbed on the surface of the activated catalyst could result in promoted catalytic kinetics, and thereby leading to significant enhancement of OER and HzOR activity without degradation during long-term catalysis. The exploration of the high-entropy lattice-disordered catalyst could promote the hydrogen production via direct and hydrazine-assisted water electrolysis, and the optimization strategies with synergy of phase engineering, lattice disordering and entropy modulation could guide the design of advanced catalysts for energy-related applications.

TI Electrochemical oxidation and advanced oxidation processes using a 3D
   hexagonal Co3O4 array anode for 4-nitrophenol
   decomposition coupled with simultaneous CO2 conversion to
   liquid fuels via a flower-like CuO cathode
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB A novel electrocatalytic system was developed to realize one-pot conversion of organic pollutants into liquid fuels such as methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH). The process combines the catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants with electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. We first coupled the electrocatalytic process with SO(4)(center dot-)based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) using a 3D-hexagonal Co3O4 anode. In this step, 4-NP was mineralized to CO2, and then the CO2 was converted to CH3OH and C2H5OH by electrocatalytic reduction using a flower-like CuO cathode. The experimental results show the destruction of 4-NP (60 mL, 10 mg/L) can be as high as 99%. In addition, the yields of CH3OH and C2H5OH were 98.29 mu mol/L and 40.95 mu mol/L, respectively, which represents a conversion of 41.8% of 4-NP into liquid fuels; the electron efficiency was 73.1%. In addition, we found that 3D-hexagonal arrays of Co3O4 with different morphologies can be obtained by adding different amounts of urea. We also investigated the formation mechanism of novel 3D-hexagonal Co3O4 arrays for the first time. A mechanism was proposed to explain the electrocatalytic steps involved in the conversion of 4-NP to CH3OH and C2H5OH and the synergetic effects between AOPs and electrocatalysis.

TI N-doped carbon encapsulated nickel nanoparticles: rational fabrication
   and ultra-high performance for ethanol oxidation
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB N-doped carbon encapsulated nickel nanoparticles (NiNC) are prepared from mixtures of nickel salt, glucose and urea by a simple heating protocol. A higher viscosity of the mixture inhibits the migration of Ni species such that highly dispersed and very small Ni nanoparticles form during heat treatment. The sizes of the Ni nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the composition of the raw mixtures. The optimized sample of NiNC-4 contains Ni nanoparticles of 2.02 nm in size which afford a large metal surface area of 400.7 m(2) g (1) and a high nitrogen content of 7.21 at%. An ultra-high current density of 327 mA cm (2) is achieved in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte containing 1 M ethanol using NiNC-4 as the electrocatalyst. NiNC-4 electrodes also exhibit a good long-term cycling stability. After 500 cycles, 89% of the initial current density is sustained in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte containing 0.5 M ethanol. 96.8% of the initial current density is retained by moving the NiNC-4 electrode into fresh 0.1 M NaOH solution with 0.5 M ethanol after 500 cycles. The excellent electrocatalytic properties of NiNC-4 for ethanol oxidation stem from the synergistic effect of the porous carbon substrate, abundant N-containing groups and the small nickel nanoparticle size.

   bifunctional catalyst for hydrogen production via urea
   electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Substituting low theoretical potential of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for the high theoretical potential of water splitting at the anode (oxygen evolution reaction) is meaningful for hydrogen energy storage and conversion. In this work, a bifunctional catalyst, cobalt nitride nanoflakes supported on Ni foam (CoN NF/NF), was synthesized for both UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A two-electrode electrolyzer (CoN NF/NF||CoN NF/NF) was constructed. To drive 100 mA/cm(2), the voltage of CoN NF/NF||CoN NF/NF only 1.698 V is required, which is much lower than that of Pt/C||IrO2 (1.860 V) and the current density can be maintained for 30 h. Graphic abstract A non-noble metal bifunctional catalyst, cobalt nitride nanoflakes supported on Ni foam (CoN NF/NF) was used as both anode and cathode materials for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), showing excellent catalytic activity and stability for urea electrolysis assisted hydrogen production.

TI Hollow bimetallic selenide derived from a hierarchical MOF-based
   Prussian blue analogue for urea electrolysis
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Because of its low thermodynamic voltage (0.37 V), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an ideal method to replace the OER, accelerate the anodic oxidation reaction and reduce the energy consumption of overall water splitting. In this work, bimetallic selenide with a hollow nanocube structure exhibits remarkable catalyst activity towards the UOR. A hierarchical MOF-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA) is constructed by growing Ni-Co PBA on an MOF-Ni template. By controlling the reaction time and temperature, the Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue (denoted as PBA@MOF-Ni) has the morphology of nanocubes evenly growing on flower-like MOF-Ni. After the selenide reaction by a solvothermal method, PBA@MOF-Ni is converted to Co-Ni/Se (denoted as PBA@MOF-Ni/Se), which has a structure with hollow nanocubes and maintains the shape of a flower. This hierarchical MOF-based PBA selenide exhibits good catalytic activity due to the addition of MOFs and the synergistic effect of bimetals. PBA@MOF-Ni/Se can be used as both a cathode and an anode in urea electrolysis. In particular for the UOR, the performance of PBA@MOF-Ni/Se is much better than that for the OER. In the performance comparison between urea electrolysis and water splitting, PBA@MOF-Ni/Se parallel to PBA@MOF-Ni/Se only needs 1.49 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than the voltage required for water splitting.

TI Co, Mn co-doped Fe9S11@Ni9S8
   supported on nickel foam as a high efficiency electrocatalyst for the
   oxygen evolution reaction and urea oxidation reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The Earth's fossil resources will be exhausted soon, so it is urgent to find clean and efficient new energy for replacing fossil resources. Hydrogen energy is gradually attracting the attention of the public and electrolysis of water is considered to be one of the important means of hydrogen production because of its simplicity and convenience. In this paper, a hydrothermal method for the synthesis of a Co and Mn co-doped bimetallic sulfide Fe9S11@Ni9S8 electrocatalyst is proposed for the first time. The prepared Co-Mn-Fe9S11@Ni9S8/NF electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). It can provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with only 193 mV overpotential for the OER and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with only 1.33 V potential for the UOR, which are far superior to those of most reported electrocatalysts. What is noteworthy is that the unique nanoflower structure of Co-Mn-Fe9S11@Ni9S8/NF increases the specific surface area of the material and the introduction of Co and Mn ions promotes the formation of high valence state Ni and Fe and enhances the charge transfer rate. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the in situ generated Co-Mn-Fe-NiOOH material derived from Co-Mn-Fe9S11@Ni9S8 exhibits the best water adsorption energy and the best electrical conductivity, thus improving the catalytic performance of the material. This work provided a new idea for the development of bimetallic cation doped electrocatalysts with high efficiency and low cost.

TI Hydrolysis of Urea for Ammonia-Based Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Nowadays, the ammonia-based wet flue gas desulfurization is gaining more popularity. In this study, the ammoniabased wet flue gas desulfurization obtained ammonia resource from urea hydrolysis instead of anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia, which was beneficial for the development of circular economy. An electric-heating reactor was employed as the hydrolysis reactor instead of traditional ones using hot air or water vapor as the heat carrier. The effects of temperature, pressure, urea solution concentration, and time on urea hydrolysis were investigated, and the optimum hydrolysis condition was estimated to be 30 (wt, %) urea solution hydrolyzing for 4 h at 140 degrees C, 0.4 MPa. The desulfurization experiment was conducted in a bubbling reactor. The effects of SO2 concentration and liquid gas ratio on desulfurization were investigated. The ammonia-based absorbent for desulfurization was prepared by the ammonia produced from the 30 (wt, %) urea solution hydrolyzing for 4 h at 140 degrees C, 0.4 MPa. The experimental results showed that all desulfurization efficiencies at different SO2 concentrations exceeded 99%, and a higher liquid-gas ratio could raise the desulfurization efficiency. The suitable pH range for this ammoniabased absorbent is 6.5-7.5. It was also found that higher SO2 concentration and lower liquid gas ratio could promote the generation of high added-value ammonium sulfate.

TI Adaptive Active Site Turning for Superior OER and UOR on
   Ir-Ni3N Catalyst
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Renewable energy-based electrocatalytic oxidation for hydrogen production in complex reaction environments such as industrial wastewater and human urine demands high-performing catalysts to conduct switchable urea oxidation reactions (UOR) and traditional oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Here, a novel bifunctional nanosheet electrocatalyst is reported, Ir-Ni3N, which exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for both OER and UOR under alkaline conditions. Specifically, the overpotentials at 100 mA cm(-2 )for OER and UOR are 1.59 and 1.37 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) respectively, which are superior to most of the recently reported nickel-based catalysts. Accordingly, a comprehensive mechanism for competitive catalytic activities of Ni and Ir sites in Ir-Ni3N and the switch between OER and UOR that guarantees consistent hydrogen production is proposed. This study provides a feasible strategy for continuous hydrogen production aided by reagent-adaptive electrocatalysts in urea-containing wastewater.

   modification with Ni<SUP>2+</SUP>
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Cosmetic brush-like Co(3)O(4)nanowires grown on carbon cloth were prepared by regulating the addition of trisodium citrate by hydrothermal synthesis. Then a simple liquid-phase ion exchange was carried out to improve the electrochemical performance of Co(3)O(4)by surface modification with Ni2+. After surface modification, at a current density of 4 A g(-1), the specific capacity significantly increased from 276.1 C g(-1)(720.5 F g(-1)) to 655.9 C g(-1)(1525.4 F g(-1)). Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic oxidation performances of methanol and urea were also improved significantly. The enhanced electrochemical properties were attributed to the modification of the surface of Co(3)O(4)with Ni2+.

TI Oxovanadium(IV) unsymmetrical salophen complex supported on modified
   silica-coated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles: A magnetically recoverable
   nanocatalyst for efficient and selective oxidation of sulfides and
   thiols
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this study, an oxovanadium(IV) unsymmetrical salophen complex, VO(salophen-OH) where salophen-OH = 4-[(E)-{(2-[(E)-2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino]phenyl}imino)methyl]benzene-1,3-diol, was synthesized and immo-bilized on the surface of chloro-functionalized silica-coated CoFe2O4 (CoFe2O4@SiO2@CPTMS) magnetic nanoparticles. FT-IR and EDX spectra, TEM and SEM images, XRD pattern, TGA, ICP, and VSM measurements were applied to characterize the resulting CoFe2O4@SiO2@CPTMS@VO(salophen-OH) nanoparticles. The developed CoFe2O4@SiO2@CPTMS@VO(salophen-OH) magnetic nanoparticle was used as a remarkably effi-cient nanocatalyst, which facilitates the chemo-selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides using 30 % H2O2 and also enables the oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides using urea/H2O2 (UHP) in ethanol at room temperature. This catalytic system presented disulfides and sulfoxides as optimal products that showed good to excellent yields, and there was no over-oxidation of disulfides and sulfoxides to undesirable by-products. An external magnet can be used to recover this nanocatalyst magnetically, and it can be recycled up to five times in both oxidation reactions without losing its catalytic action. Moreover, the recycled catalyst shows no major differ-ences in its XRD pattern and FT-IR spectrum compared to the fresh catalyst.

TI Maximizing urea-/hydrazine-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production by
   defective nickel copper selenide nanostructures
SO FLATCHEM
AB Replacing the formidable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with other oxidizable species is an appealing approach to attain highly efficient hydrogen (H-2) generation with a lower potential. Accordingly, the kinetically favorable electrooxidation reaction of urea or hydrazine molecule can increase the return on energy profiteering and prevent pollutant emission. Thus, opening up an innovative direction to replace the sluggish OER and generate high-purity H-2 gas via an energy-saving approach. Thus, constructing highly efficient and stable bifunctional electrodes/electrocatalysts is a key to realize economical and sustainable H-2 production. In this work, we developed defect-enriched two-dimensional (2D) heterogeneous nickel copper selenide (D/Ni-Cu-Se) on a conductive Ni foam (NF) scaffold as an integrated bifunctional electrocatalytic electrode for energy-saving for H-2 production. The self-supported D/Ni-Cu-Se/NF electrode with a regulated interfacial property and abundant metal defects is fabricated through a hydrothermal approach and a metal-defect engineering route. The thus-prepared electrode exhibits a high electrocatalytic performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, achieving the catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 87.7 mV and 1.335 V vs. RHE, respectively. In relation, the two-electrode urea-water electrolyzer and hydrazine-water electrolyzer utilizing the bifunctional D/Ni-Cu-Se/NF as both the cathode and anode electrodes reveal a cell voltage of similar to 1.395 V and 0.268 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH/0.33 M urea and 1.0 M KOH/0.25 M hydrazine, respectively, which is much less than that of conventional water electrolysis (1.572 V). The implemented electrolyzer systems consequently endow high long-term durability over 48 h of continuous electrolysis, indicating that the defect-rich D/Ni-Cu-Se/NF can serve as a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst with an outstanding electrolysis performance and excellent stability for H-2 generation. Indeed, such a novel bifunctional electrode configuration and corresponding electrolysis performances are much desired for energy-saving electrolytic H-2 production and pave the way for exploring highly efficient and robust electrodes.

TI Regulating the Ni-O bond length by constructing Ni(OH)2/CNTs
   heterostructure for enhanced nucleophile electrocatalytic oxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The electro-driven generation of the active Ni(OH)O species is crucial for the Ni(OH)(2) to efficiently drive the nucleophilic oxidation reaction. However, the strategy to facilitate the generation of the Ni(OH)O species is only limited to the construction of the Pt/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructures. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are employed to reduce the dehydrogenation energy of the Ni(OH)(2) by constructing Ni(OH)(2)/60CNTs heterostructures. The CNTs shorten the Ni-O bond length and increase the valence state of Ni atoms in Ni(OH)(2), thus highly promoting the generation of Ni(OH)O. When the Ni(OH)(2)/60CNTs heterostructure is used for urea oxidation reaction, it displays highly enhanced catalytic activity relative to pure Ni(OH)(2), attaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.36 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. This work provides a new strategy for reducing the dehydrogenation energy of the Ni(OH)(2) and will inspire more research work on the recognition of the impact of metal-oxygen bond length on NOR activity.

TI Improving the Ca-assisted Urea-Glass Method for the Synthesis of
   Zirconium Nitride as Potential Electrocatalyst for the Nitrogen
   Reduction Reaction
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB Zirconium mononitride (ZrN), among other nitrides, is of interest as a catalyst in general and especially for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Synthesis of nanoparticulate ZrN is challenging due to the formation of undesired other phases and the need for hazardous precursors or high temperatures. The urea glass method (UGM) was used in this work to synthesise nanoparticulate zirconium nitride. A focused parameter variation of the precursor composition and process conditions lead to an optimised synthesis, greatly improving material purity in regard to minor phase and residual carbon content. The nitride starts to form at a pyrolysis temperature of 900 degrees C, likely by irreversible decomposition of previously-formed oxynitride, which forms from amorphous ZrO2 and urea during pyrolysis. An increased pyrolysis temperature improves product purity but slightly lowers nitride purity. Calcium admixture slows the urea decomposition, yielding a more phase-pure product with less residual carbon at low amounts. A classical carbothermal nitridation (CN) was used in comparison to the UGM to synthesise ZrN. This was successful in synthesising zirconium carbonitride Zr(N, C) without minor phase, but significant carbon remains if added overstoichiometrically. Using less carbon and a longer dwelling time yielded ZrN without significant carbide (ZrC) incorporation or residual carbon, but with some minor ZrO2 phase, proving a promising synthesis route. A limited electrochemical investigation of a synthesised ZrN material was carried out to scope the general material behaviour and to qualitatively derive the potential catalytic activity for the NRR. Higher reductive currents in nitrogen-saturated electrolyte qualitatively point to NRR activity, but further and more in-depth examination is required.
   Zirconium nitride (ZrN) is a theoretically predicted active catalyst for the emerging electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). It can be synthesized by the urea-glass method (UGM) at moderate conditions. The Ca-assisted UGM is explored to improve the product purity of synthesized ZrN nanoparticles and test a selection thereof in qualitative electrochemical experiments for catalytic activity. image

TI Novel Co-Mn-O Nanosheet Catalyst for CO Preferential Oxidation Toward
   Hydrogen Purification
SO AICHE JOURNAL
AB Co-Mn-O composite oxide nanosheet catalyst was successfully prepared using a facile urea-assisted one-step hydrothermal method in the absence of organic or organic templating reagent. Co-Mn-O nanosheet catalyst was optimized by varying hydrothermal process parameters such as molar ratio of Co-Mn to urea, hydrothermal temperature, and hydrothermal time. Various characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and H-2 temperature-programmed reduction were used to reveal the relationship between catalyst nature and catalytic performance in CO preferential oxidation (CO PROX) in excess H-2. The developed Co-Mn-O nanosheet catalyst have demonstrated much superior catalytic performance to Co-Mn-O nanoparticle, particularly in the low temperature range, and 100% CO conversion over the developed Co-Mn-O nanosheet can be achieved in temperature range of 50 to 150 degrees C at 10,000 mL g(-1) h(-1) of gas hourly space velocity in the standard feed. Furthermore, the almost complete CO removal over Co-Mn-O nanosheet at 125 degrees C of low temperature with 94.9% selectivity can be achieved even in the simulated reformed gas. The excellent catalytic performance is ascribed to nanosheet morphology, more surface Co3+, smaller average crystallite size, higher reducibility, and strong Co-Mn interaction. Catalytic stability investigation indicates the developed nanostructured catalyst exhibits high catalytic stability for CO PROX reaction in simulated gas. The developed Co-Mn-O nanosheet catalyst can be a potential candidate for catalytic elimination of trace CO from H-2-rich gas for Proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications.

TI A High-Performance Nonenzymatic Urea Sensor Based on
   Graphene-NiO-Polyaniline
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB A novel graphene-NiO-polyaniline (Gr-NiO-PANI) was prepared by electrolysis, electrodeposition and electropolymerization methods, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) proved the successful preparation and composition of the Gr-NiO-PANI hybrid. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to further determine the structure and morphology of as-prepared composites. Cyclic voltammetry confirmed that Gr-NiO-PANI composite had excellent detection effect on urea. By comparing the electrochemical behavior of Gr-NiO-PANI with Gr-NiO and Gr-PANI modified electrodes toward urea, the role of NiO in composite and the detection mechanism of urea were explored. A common linear sweep voltammetry technique was used to detect urea. The test results showed that urea exhibited a good response on the Gr-NiO-PANI modified electrode. In the range of 60 similar to 160 mu M urea concentration, the response current of the Gr-NiO-PANI modified electrode is proportional to the urea concentration, and the concentration stand curve equation was I(mu A) = -0.0886C(mu M) + 58.39 (R-2 = 0.9917). The as-fabricated sensor exhibited high sensitivity (1.266 mu A/mu M), lower limit of detection (7.35 mu M), excellent reproducibility, and so it can provide a simple and cheap method for detection of urea in environmental monitoring, agriculture, medical industry.

AB A simple, rapid and sensitive electrochemical sensor for determination of urea has been developed based on two-dimensional (2D) Free-standing NiO nanosheet. High quality, ultrathin two-dimensional NiO nano-sheets were synthesized by using graphene oxide paper as sacrificial template. Various techniques such as x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the morphology of the nanostructure. According to TEM image, the average size of the as-synthesized NiO nanosheets is around 50 nm and with 5-20 nm pores. Electrochemical studies indicate that the 2D NiO papers exhibit excellent stability and high electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of urea in an alkaline medium, even without any conductive supporting agent, and low oxidation potential (vs SCE), high sensitivity (3.4 A/M cm(2)) and a low detection limit (2 mu M) as a non-enzymatic sensor for urea.

TI Recent Developments in Membrane-Free Hybrid Water Electrolysis for
   Low-Cost Hydrogen Production Along with Value-Added Products
SO SMALL
AB Water electrolysis using renewable energy is considered as a promising technique for sustainable and green hydrogen production. Conventional water electrolysis has two components - hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the cathode and anode respectively. However, electrolysis of water suffers from high overpotential due to the slow kinetics of OER. To overcome this hybrid water electrolysis has been developed by replacing conventional anode oxidation producing oxygen with oxidation of cost-effective materials producing value-added chemicals. This review summarizes recent advances in organic oxidative reactions such as alcohols, urea, hydrazine, and biomass at the anode instead of OER. Furthermore, the review also highlights the use of membrane-free hybrid water electrolysis as a method to overcome the cost and complexity associated with conventional membrane-based electrolyzer thereby improving overall efficiency. This approach holds promise for scalable and cost-effective large-scale hydrogen production along with value-added products. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed for further development in membrane-free hybrid water electrolysis.
   Membrane-free hybrid water electrolysis lowers system costs. Utilization of bifunctional electrocatalysts reduces overpotential enhances overall efficiency of Hydrogen production with value-added products in the anode. image

TI Constructing rod-shaped Co2C/MoN as efficient bifunctional
   electrocatalyst towards overall urea- water electrolysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB In this paper, Co2C/MoN/NF at different calcination temperatures (T = 500, 550, 600, 650, 700 degrees C) was prepared in situ on 3D foam nickel (NF) by hydrothermal treatment and high-temperature calcination. The experimental results show that the sample synthesized at 600 degrees C (Co2C/MoN-600/NF) has the best catalytic capacity and the maximum electro-chemical active area. For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the potential is only-176 mV at 100 mA cm-2, meanwhile, only 1.42 V is needed for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Furthermore, a two-electrode electrolyze cell of Co2C/MoN-600/NFIICo2C/MoN-600/NF was constructed. And the voltage required for overall urea splitting (OUS) is 1.507 V at 50 mA cm-2, which is 171 mV lower than that of overall water splitting (OWS, 1.678 V). Moreover, the prepared catalyst not only can treat urea in wastewater but also catalyze the production of hydrogen. Therefore, it will be a promising green electrocatalyst.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Particle size effect in glucose oxidation with Pd/CB catalysts
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Palladium nanoparticles supported on carbon black were synthesized by two different methods precipitation reduction (PR) and urea-assisted sodium formate homogeneous deposition (HD). The catalysts were then submitted to thermal treatments at 573 K, 873 K and 1173 K to produce catalysts with a wide range of particle sizes. The obtained catalysts were characterized by XPS, TEM CO chemisorption and TGA measurements and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of glucose to gluconic acid. It was found that catalysts with a palladium particles size of 7 rim exhibit the highest activity. Above or below this particular value the oxidative dehydrogenation of glucose appeared less efficient.

TI Cheap, High-Performance, and Wearable Mn Oxide Supercapacitors with
   Urea-LiCIO4 Based Gel Electrolytes
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Here we report a simple, scalable, and low-cost method to enhance the electrochemical properties of Mn oxide electrodes for highly efficient and flexible symmetrical supercapacitors. The method involving printing on a printer, pencil drawing, and electrodeposition is established to fabricate Mn oxide/Ni-nanotube/graphite/paper hybrid electrodes operating with a low-cost, novel urea-LiClO4/PVA as gel electrolyte for flexible solid-state supercapacitor (FSSC) devices, The Mn oxide nanofiber/Ni-nanotube/graphite/paper (MNNGP) electrodes in urea-LiClO4/PVA gel electrolyte show specific capacitance (C-sp) 960 F/g in voltage region 0.8 V at S mV/s and exhibit excellent rates of capacitance retention more than 85% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the electrochemical behavior of the MNNGP' electrodes in urea-LiClO4/PVA at operating temperatures 27-110 degrees C was investigated; the results show that the MNNGP electrodes in urea-LiClO4/PVA exhibit outstanding performance (1100 F/g), even at 90 degrees C. The assembled FSSC devices based on the MNNGP electrodes in urea-LiClO4/PVA exhibit great Csp (380 F/g in potential region of 2.0 V at 5 mV/s, exhibiting superior energy:density 211.1 W h/kg) and great cycle stability (less than 15% loss after 5000 cycles at 25 mV/s). The oxidation-state change was examined by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. FSSC device would open new opportunities in developing novel portable, wearable, and roll-up electric devices owing to the cheap, high-performance, wide range of operating temperature; and simple procedures for large-area fabrication.

TI Selective oxidation of glycerol in base-free conditions over N-doped
   carbon film coated carbon supported Pt catalysts
SO CATALYSIS COMMUNICATIONS
AB A series of N-doped carbon film coated active carbon (NxC-XC-72) was prepared via direct pyrolysis of mixed XC72 (a commercial activated carbon), polyvinyl pyrrolidone and urea. Characterizations indicated that the specific area of synthesized N2.5C-XC-72 reached 281 m(2)/g and uniform meso pore channels (sized in 4.0 nm) formed. It was found that NxC-XC-72 was an excellent support for the evenly dispersion of Pt compared with raw XC-72.Pt/NxC-XC-72 was active and stable for the selective oxidation of glycerol to glyceric acid in a base-free aqueous solution. The calculated turnover frequency on the basis of surface Pt increased from 573 (in Pt/XC-72) to 706 h(-1) (in Pt/N2.5C-XC-72) at 60 degrees C.

TI Dimensionally Stable Anode Based Sensor for Urea Determination via
   Linear Sweep Voltammetry
SO SENSORS
AB Urea is an added value chemical with wide applications in the industry and agriculture. The release of urea waste to the environment affects ecosystem health despite its low toxicity. Online monitoring of urea for industrial applications and environmental health is an unaddressed challenge. Electroanalytical techniques can be a smart integrated solution for online monitoring if sensors can overcome the major barrier associated with long-term stability. Mixed metal oxides have shown excellent stability in environmental conditions with long lasting operational lives. However, these materials have been barely explored for sensing applications. This work presents a proof of concept that demonstrates the applicability of an indirect electroanalytical quantification method of urea. The use of Ti/RuO2-TiO2-SnO2 dimensional stable anode (DSA(R)) can provide accurate and sensitive quantification of urea in aqueous samples exploiting the excellent catalytic properties of DSA(R) on the electrogeneration of active chlorine species. The cathodic reduction of accumulated HClO/ClO- from anodic electrogeneration presented a direct relationship with urea concentration. This novel method can allow urea quantification with a competitive LOD of 1.83 x 10(-6) mol L-1 within a linear range of 6.66 x 10(-6) to 3.33 x 10(-4) mol L-1 of urea concentration.

TI Synthesis of NiO/MgO/ZrO2 catalyst for syngas production from partial

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB This work focuses on a facile NiO/MgO/ZrO2 synthesis protocol for syngas production via partial oxidation and dry reforming of biogas. Herein, performance of the developed cat-alysts with different amounts of MgO (0-40 %wt. of support) and NiO (10-50 %wt.) on %CH4 conversion, %CO2 conversion, H2/CO ratio, and carbon formation are studied. The results reveal the presence of monoclinic ZrO2 and tetragonal ZrO2 phases with 50%NiO/ZrO2 catalyst synthesized by surface modification technique using carbon derived from urea. Addition of MgO in the catalyst shows ability to stabilize tetragonal ZrO2 phase as well as enhance basic surface of the catalyst. These properties render the adsorption of CO2 molecules on the surface, which subsequently are reduced by carbon, leading to CO pro-duction. Appropriated amount of NiO and MgO, which is 30 %wt.

TI A novel and facile method to rapidly synthesize
   Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 nanoparticles for CO
   preferential oxidation in H2-rich stream
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMATERIALS & FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB A novel urea grind combustion (UGC) route was reported in this paper to rapidly prepare the ceria-zirconia nanoparticles (Ce0.8Zr0.2O2). For comparison, the conventional surfactant-assisted (SA) and sol-gel (SG) methods were also employed to prepare Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 nanoparticles. CO preferential oxidation in H-2-rich stream (CO-PROX) was chosen as probe reaction to investigate the catalytic performance of these Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalysts prepared with different methods to highlight the superiority of UGC. It was found that Ce0.8Zr0.2O2-UGC showed the better reducibility and oxygen mobility than the Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 prepared by SA and SG, because the UGC route favored the more incorporation of zirconia into CeO2, leading to more serious distortion of the structure, and more defective sites in the Ce0.8Zr0.2O2. As a result, Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 -UGC exhibited the higher CO conversion, better O-2 selectivity, and excellent catalytic stability without any deactivation during 72-h reaction on stream. More importantly, the UGC method, as compared to the relatively complex and time-consuming SA and SG method, is simple, facile, low-cost, time-saving (within 30 minutes) and scalable, thereby, might be very promising for the application in many fields.

TI Different methodologies for synthesis of nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes
   and their use in catalytic wet air oxidation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB In this work, a comprehensive study was performed regarding the incorporation of N-groups into the multi walled carbon nanotube sp2 network, namely, quaternary nitrogen, pyrrolic and pyridinic groups. An easy to handle, solvent-free post-doping method, combining a mechanical treatment under ball-milling followed by thermal treatments under inert atmosphere or ammonia was developed. Different nitrogen precursors (melamine, urea, NH3), different precursor/CNT ratios, presence of O-containing surface groups and final temperatures of the thermal treatment were evaluated towards the generation of active and stable N-species. The materials were characterized in terms of texture and surface chemistry by several techniques: N-2 adsorption, XPS, TPD, TGA and elemental analysis. The catalytic performance of the novel N-doped CNTs was evaluated in the oxidation of oxalic acid and phenol (used as model pollutants) by catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO). Catalytic oxidation of model pollutants is faster in the presence of samples rich in nitrogen, and also favoured in the absence of O-containing surface groups on the CNT surface.

TI Urea Enzymolysis-Induced Ions Replacing: A Promising Strategy for
   One-Pot Loading of Core-Shell Heterojunction on 1D Catalyst Support
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Even distribution of core-shell heterojunction on porous catalyst supports is promising to get the super-catalysts, yet laborious preparation hinders the wide application. A novel strategy of urea enzymolysis-induced ions replacement is proposed for one-pot loading of Bi12O17Cl2@Bi48Al2O75 core-shell heterojunction onto porous Al2O3 nanorod (named as Al2O3-Bi12O17Cl2@Bi48Al2O75). The clever combination of urea enzymolysis and precipitation reactions that consume the ions generated in urea enzymolysis can switch the "on-off" of urease, and thus allow the precise controlling of the concentration and existence time of the ions, as well as ions replacement. It is the urea enzymolysis-induced ions replacing strategy that can generate the unique structure of Al2O3-Bi12O17Cl2@Bi48Al2O75, and it is the distinctive structure that can get the selectivity of 96% benzaldehyde with 90% benzyl alcohol (BA) conversion in the photocatalytic oxidation of BA. The ions replacement, the growth of Al2O3-Bi12O17Cl2@Bi48Al2O75, and the photocatalytic mechanism are investigated in detail. This work highlights a novel and convenient strategy for one-pot loading core-shell heterojunction onto porous nanorod support, unveils a fresh biosynthesis of nanomaterials with elaborate structure, and thus paves the way for wide application of elaborate nanomaterials.
   The Al2O3-Bi12O17Cl2@Bi48Al2O75 with a unique structure of homogenous distribution of core-shell Bi12O17Cl2@Bi48Al2O75 Type II heterojunction in porous Al2O3 nanorod, is synthesized by the novel one-pot strategy of urea enzymolysis-induced ions replacement with AlCl3 and BiCl3 as reactants. image

TI Template-directed assembly of urchin-like CoSx/Co-MOF
   as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water and urea
   electrolysis
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Since the theoretical potential of urea electrolysis is lower than that of water splitting, urea electrolysis is an ideal method for hydrogen production. In this work, we have synthesized an urchin-like Co-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) grown on a Co(OH)(2)template by the gas phase method. As the specific surface area increased and more active sites were exposedcd, the low activity of the bulk MOF for electrocatalytic water splitting was overcome. Through a vulcanization reaction, surface vulcanized Co-MOF (CoSx/Co-MOF) was synthesized. CoSx/Co-MOF as a bifunctional catalyst has good catalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Compared with the catalytic activity of the OER, the potential of the UOR only needs 1.315 V (vs.RHE), while the potential of the OER needs 1.51 V (vs.RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2). The catalytic activity in the urea electrolysis of a CoSx/Co-MOF||CoSx/Co-MOF electrolyzer is much better than that in an alkaline electrolyte. The CoSx/Co-MOF||CoSx/Co-MOF electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 1.48 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for a urea electrolytic cell in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea.

TI Electro-oxidation to convert dissolved organic nitrogen and soluble
   non-reactive phosphorus to more readily removable and recoverable forms
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Conventional wastewater treatment processes cannot effectively remove dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and soluble non-reactive phosphorus (sNRP), which can pose regulatory compliance challenges for total nitrogen and total phosphorus discharges. Moreover, DON and sNRP are not easily recoverable for beneficial reuse as part of the waste to resource paradigm. Conversion of DON and sNRP to more readily removable dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (sRP), respectively, will help meet stringent nutrient limits and facilitate nutrient recovery. In this study, electro-oxidation (EO) was evaluated for conversion of four DON compounds to DIN and five sNRP compounds to sRP. EO was more efficient and provided higher extents of conversion of the recalcitrant nutrient fractions compared to a more traditional advanced oxidation process, UV/H2O2. Direct electron transfer was likely the dominant oxidation mechanism for EO-based DON and sNRP conversion, with DON being more recalcitrant. Among the DON compounds tested, greater availability of primary amine (C-N bonds) yielded greater conversion compared to compounds with fewer primary amine or those with secondary amine (C-N-C bond). Among the sNRP compounds tested, those with P-O-C bonds (organic sNRP) converted more readily than those with P-O-P bonds (inorganic sNRP), presumably because cleavage of the latter bond requires greater energy. Using 30 min of EO treatment, the highest DON and sNRP compound conversion was 11.7 +/- 0.09% for urea and 31.1 +/- 0.75% for beta-glycerol phosphate. A similar extent of EO-based conversion of DON (6.41 +/- 1.5%) and sNRP (32.7 +/- 3.3%) was observed in real wastewater.

TI The reusing of waste bio-oil as additive on enhanced urea-based
   selective non-catalytic reduction denitrification
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Pyrolysis polygeneration has been proven to be effective in solid waste recycling, while cleaner production is hindered by nitrogen oxide emissions and waste oil utilization. In this study, waste bio-oil was proposed as additive for promoting urea-based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) denitrification efficiency to establish bio-oil reusing process and the influence of waste bio-oil on promoting SNCR denitrification were investigated. Then the effects of temperature, bio-oil components and fly ash on SNCR denitrification characteristics were explored. The results illustrated that 5 wt% bio-oil additives would widen the optimum denitrification tem-perature window by 24.8 % (from 210.25 to 262.43 degrees C), reduce the reduction temperature by 62.11 degrees C (from 944.04 to 881.93 degrees C), and increase the denitrification efficiency by 21 %. Among the main components in waste bio-oil, acetic acid was more effective than phenol and furfural in promoting SNCR denitrification under 900 degrees C, a large amount of OH was produced to promote the reduction of NH3 and HNCO. In addition, the existence of fly ash could promote urea oxidation and reduce denitrification efficiency because of the catalytic effect of CaO and Fe2O3 on urea oxidation.

TI One-step combustion synthesis of high-performance nanosized Co3O4 and
   Ag-Co3O4 catalysts for propane total oxidation
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Devising an effective strategy to refine the physicochemical properties of Co3O4 3 O 4 and tune the Ag-Co interaction is pivotal for developing superior Ag-Co3O4 3 O 4 catalysts targeting VOCs abatement. In this study, nanosized Co3O4 3 O 4 and Ag-Co3O4 3 O 4 (Ag content of 0.5-5.0 wt%) catalysts were prepared via a facile one-pot urea combustion method. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized using various techniques and their performance in propane total oxidation was evaluated. Compared to its counterpart obtained through the direct decomposition of cobalt nitrate, the nanosized Co3O4 3 O 4 exhibited a larger surface area, more oxygen vacancies, better reducibility, and thus superior propane oxidation activity. The addition of Ag can further enhance the catalytic performance by significantly improving the redox properties of Co3O4. 3 O 4 . The best performance was achieved with the catalyst 3.5 wt% Ag-Co3O4, 3 O 4 , which mineralized 90 % of propane into CO2 2 at 200 degrees C and exhibited excellent cycling stability and long-term durability. In addition, 3.5 wt% Ag-Co3O4 3 O 4 demonstrated high activity under various conditions, including high propane concentration (6000 ppm), high space velocity (160,000 mL g- 1h- h- 1 ), and high water content (10 vol%), making it a promising candidate for practical VOCs removal.

TI Modulation of rat liver urea cycle and related ammonium metabolism by
   sex and cafeteria diet
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB High-energy (hyperlipidic) cafeteria diets induce insulin resistance limiting glucose oxidation, and lower amino acid catabolism. Despite high amino-N intake, amino acids are preserved, lowering urea excretion. We analysed how energy partition induced by cafeteria diet affects liver ammonium handling and urea cycle. Female and male rats were fed control or cafeteria diets for 30 days. There was a remarkable constancy on enzyme activities and expressions of urea cycle and ammonium metabolism. The key enzymes controlling urea cycle: carbamoyl-P synthase 1, arginino-succinate synthase and arginase expressions were decreased by diet (albeit more markedly in males), and their activities were correlated with the gene expressions. The effects observed, in ammonium handling enzyme activities and expressions behaved in a way similar to that of the urea cycle, showing a generalized downregulation of liver amino acid catabolism. This process was affected by sex. The different strategies of amino-N handling by females and males further modulated the preservation of 2-amino N under sufficient available energy. The effects of sex were more marked than those of diet were, since different metabolism survival strategies changed substrate partition and fate. The data presented suggest a lower than expected N flow to the liver, which overall importance for amino acid metabolism tends to decrease with both cafeteria diet and female sex. Under standard conditions, liver availability of ammonium was low and controlled. The situation was unchanged (or even lowered) in cafeteria-fed rats, ultimately depending on intestinal amino acid catabolism.

TI Pd-Au Nanostructured Electrocatalysts with Tunable Compositions for
   Formic Acid Oxidation
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Green transition requires strategies to develop active and stable nanomaterials for energy conversion. We describe the preparation of Pd-Au bimetallic nanocatalysts using a surfactant-free electrodeposition method in a deep eutectic solvent (DES) and test their electrocatalytic performance in the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). We use choline chloride and urea DES to tune the compositions of Pd and Au in the bimetallic nanostructures, as well as their morphologies and active surface areas. We measure the increase in electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the prepared Pd-Au bimetallic surfaces by Cu underpotential deposition (UPD). Our results indicate a surface area increase of 5-to 12-fold compared to Pd and PdAu extended polycrystalline electrodes. We observe that the higher acti v i t y of Pd-Au nanostructures is principally due to their increased active area. Our results also reveal that Pd-Au nanostructures with ca. 50% of Pd and Au display the best activity and stabi l i t y in relation to the Pd mass loading, proving the synergy between Pd and Au in t h e bimetallic catalyst. We highlight that an in-depth analysis of the ECSA, as well as surface and electronic structure effects in bimetallic nanostructures, is crucial for the rationalization of their catalytic properties.

TI Electro-oxidation of tri(ammonium) phosphate: New hydrogen source
   compatible with Ni-based electro-catalysts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Predominantly, the reported Ni-based electro-catalysts are not applicable anode materials for the alcohols-based proton exchange membrane fuel cells due to the high onset potentials. Alternatively, these non-precious materials can be exploited for hydrogen generation from alcohols with small biases. However, as the nickel oxy(hydroxide) active species is a reactant in the alcohols electro-oxidation reactions, so these materials are exhausted and have to be regenerated. Recently, hydrogen could be extracted from tri(ammonium) phosphate using Ni/C nanostructures as effective catalysts in a simple batch reactor. In this study, electro-oxidation of tri(ammonium) phosphate using Ni-decorated graphene is investigated. The utilized catalyst has been prepared by simple one-pot synthesis procedure; calcination of well mixed nickel acetate/commercial sugar composite. The results indicated that the prepared Ni-decorated graphene is an effective electrocatalyst for tri(ammonium) phosphate oxidation when the nickel content is optimized; 3 wt% metal is the best composition. Moreover, chronoamperometry analysis results indicated that the active layer is not being consumed during the electro-oxidation reaction of the tri(ammonium phosphate) which creates a distinct advantage for this fertilizer over alcohols. Stability of the active layer is attributed to performing Ni(OH)2/Ni(OOH) redox

TI The Effect of Lactobacillus plantarum CQPC02 on Fatigue and
   Biochemical Oxidation Levels in a Mouse Model of Physical Exhaustion
SO FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION
AB Chinese Sichuan pickle is a fermented food rich in microorganisms. Microorganisms have the potential to become an important new form of potent future therapeutic capable of treating human disease. Selecting vitamin C as a positive control, a lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum CQPC02, LP-CQPC02) isolated from Sichuan pickle was given to mice over 4 weeks to investigate the effect of CQPC02 on fatigue levels and biochemical oxidation phenomena in exercise-exhausted Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. The fatigue model was established by forced swimming of mice, the levels of hepatic glycogen, skeletal muscle glycogen, lactic acid, blood urea nitrogen and free fatty acid were measured by physicochemical methods, serum serum creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured by kits, the histopathological changes in the livers of mice were observed by H&E slicing, and the mRNA changes in the livers and skeletal muscles were observed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Both vitamin C and LP-CQPC02 increased swimming exhaustion time. The concentration of LP-CQPC02 and exhaustion time were positively correlated. LP-CQPC02 also increased liver glycogen, skeletal muscle glycogen and free fatty acid content in mice and reduced lactic acid and blood urea nitrogen content in a dose-dependent manner. As walnut albumin antioxidant peptide concentration increased, levels of mouse CK, AST, and AST gradually decreased. LP-CQPC02 increased SOD and CAT levels and decreased MDA levels in a dose-dependent fashion. LP-CQPC02 up-regulated expression of mRNA encoding copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), and CAT in swimming exhaustion mouse liver tissue. LP-CQPC02 also up-regulated alanine/serine/cysteine/threonine transporter 1 (ASCT1) expression while down-regulating syncytin-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression in swimming exhaustion mouse skeletal muscle. Overall, LP-CQPC02 had a clear anti-fatigue and anti-oxidation effect. This suggests that LP-CQPC02 can be developed as a microbiological therapeutic agent.

TI Increasing Electrical Conductivity of Copper Nanocomposite By Carbon
   Nanotube Oxide Modified With Poly Citric Acid And Urea
SO JOURNAL OF INORGANIC AND ORGANOMETALLIC POLYMERS AND MATERIALS
AB In this study, deposition of copper nanoparticles is synthesized by nanocomposite of carbon nanotube oxide modified with poly citric acid (Cu@CNTO/PCA) and a mixture of amine and poly citric acid (Cu@CNTO-amine/PCA) in different weight concentrations. The thickness, weight, conductivity and resistance of electrical, and hardness of the copper coating on the electrode are calculated after optimizing the parameters of current density (3000 mV), deposition time (45 min), stirring speed (300 rpm), and pH (2-3) at ambient temperature. To analyze the copper coating created on the electrode, the most well-known and widely used techniques are used: Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), and X-ray Energy Diffraction spectroscopy (EDX). The addition of carbon nanotubes enhances the process of nucleation and modification of grains and reduces the oxidation of copper, thus improving the mechanical properties of the copper coating. So, the electrical conductivity of the copper coating reaches 1526 mu s.cm-1 in 40 wt.% of Cu@CNTO-amine/PCA nanocomposite at a current density of 3000 mV. Another advantage of this deposition method is at ambient temperature so that the copper coating turns black when the temperature increases to 35 degrees C. The modification of the surface with poly citric acid causes more dissolution and distribution of CNTO in the electrolyte solution keeps the pH of the environment in the range of 2-3 during deposition and causes the synthesis of shiny copper coatings. Urea-containing nanocomposite increases the electrical conductivity and stability of the copper coating, and compared to graphene oxide nanoparticles, it solves the problems of oxygen functional groups and provides its thermal stability. The results show that the thickness of the encapsulated copper coating layer depends on the chemical composition of the electrolyte, temperature, current duration, and current intensity. By controlling these factors, the thickness of the coated copper layer can be adjusted in the range of 1 to 10 mu m. The method employed in this paper enables the controlled synthesis of metal-nanomaterial composites that can potentially be processed into high-capacity electrical conductors.

TI Defect Engineering of Nickel-Based Compounds for Energy-Saving
   H2 Production
SO ENERGIES
AB The urea oxidation reaction (UOR), requiring less energy to produce hydrogen, is considered as a potential alternative to the traditional oxygen evolution reaction. Consequently, developing highly efficient UOR catalysts to facilitate H-2 production has garnered widespread attention. A promising approach to enhancing the effectiveness of these electrocatalysts is defect engineering. By introducing structural defects, defect engineering can expose more active sites and optimize their electronic structure, thereby improving their activity. This work offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress in defect engineering of nickel-based electrocatalysts for the UOR. It summarizes various strategies for generating defects, including the creation of vacancies, doping, the incorporation of single atoms, amorphization, and achieving high refractivity. Furthermore, we discuss the advanced characterization techniques commonly used to identify the presence of defects in these electrocatalysts, as well as to determine their detailed structures. Finally, we outline the prospects and challenges associated with the systematic design and fabrication of novel UOR electrocatalysts with tunable defects, aiming to further enhance their efficiency and stability.

TI Oxidation-alkaline-enhanced abiotic humification valorizes lignin-rich
   biogas digestate into artificial humic acids
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This study introduces a cost-effective, mild thermal abiotic humification method for producing highly humified artificial humic acids (AHAs) from lignin-rich biogas digestate. Derived from the anaerobic digestion of cattle manure, the digestate slurry undergoes an MnO2-KOH-urea-enhanced humification reaction. Key process variables, such as MnO2 dose (0-15 mg/L), KOH dose (0-1 mol/L), urea dose (0-1.2 mol/L), reaction time (30-150 min), and temperature (25-85 degrees C), were systematically explored to optimize AHA yield, carboxylic acid content, and lignin removal. Optimal conditions, employing 7.69 mg/L of MnO2, 0.57 mol/L of KOH, and 0.63 mol/L of urea at 85 degrees C for 106 min, resulted in an impressive AHA yield of 32.15%, featuring a significant carboxylic acid content of 3.325 mmol/g. Under these conditions, up to 65% of lignin was effectively removed, accompanied by the release of orthophosphate up to 258 mg/L. The produced AHAs exhibited reduced toxicity, as demonstrated by substantial reductions of 54.13%, 57.14%, and 42.50% in phenols, furfural, and hydroxymethylfurfural, respectively. Notably, the AHAs displayed favorable characteristics, including a lower molecular weight (760.49 g/mol), diminished aromaticity (66.25% reduction), higher humification degree (lower C/N ratio of 8.79), increased oxidation degree (higher O/C ratio of 0.6), and elevated spectral index of humification (higher E4/E6 of 4.58). Analytical techniques, such as FT-IR, XPS, and TGA-MS, revealed chemical resemblance and enhanced functionality of AHAs compared to natural counterparts. Differentiation between AHA, lignin, and humification residues was confirmed through SEM-EDX, ICP-OES, and organic/inorganic carbon analyses. The obtained AHAs exhibit promising characteristics suitable for diverse applications in sustainable agriculture and environmental management.

TI Generation of semicarbazide from natural azine development in foods,
   followed by reaction with urea compounds
SO FOOD ADDITIVES AND CONTAMINANTS PART A-CHEMISTRY ANALYSIS CONTROL
   EXPOSURE & RISK ASSESSMENT
AB This paper proposes a mechanism to explain the trace levels of natural semicarbazide occasionally observed in foods. The analytical derivative of semicarbazide, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde semicarbazone, is often measured as a metabolite marker to detect the widely banned antibiotic nitrofurazone. However, this marker is not specific as semicarbazide may be present in foods for several reasons other than exposure to nitrofurazone. In some cases, an entirely natural origin of semicarbazide is suspected, although up until now there was no explanation about how semicarbazide could occur naturally. In this work, semicarbazide is proposed as being generated from natural food compounds via an azine intermediate. Hydrazine, in the form of azines or hydrazones, may be generated in dilute aqueous solution from the natural food compounds ammonia, hydrogen peroxide and acetone, following known oxidation chemistry. When this mixture was prepared in the presence of ureas such as allantoin, urea, biuret or hydroxyurea, and then analysed by the standard method for the determination of semicarbazide, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde semicarbazone was detected. 2-Nitrobenzaldehyde aldazine was also found, and it may be a general marker for azines in foods. This proposal, that azine formation is central to semicarbazide development, provides a convergence of the published mechanisms for semicarbazide. The reaction starts with hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, atmospheric oxygen or hypochlorite; generates hydrazine either by an oxaziridine intermediate or via the chlorination of ammonia; and then either route may converge on azine formation, followed by reaction with a urea compound. Additionally, carbamate ion may speculatively generate semicarbazide by reaction with hydrazine, which might be a significant route in the case of the hypochlorite treatment of foods or food contact surfaces. Significantly, detection of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde semicarbazone may be somewhat artefactual because semicarbazide can form during the acid conditions of analysis, which can free hydrazine in the presence of urea compounds.

TI Biogenic concrete protection driven by the formate oxidation by
   Methylocystis parvus OBBP
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB The effectiveness of Microbiologically Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) from the formate oxidation by Methylocystis parvus OBBP as an alternative process for concrete protection was investigated. MICP was induced on Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC), the model material, by immersing the material in 10(9) M. parvus cells mL(-1) containing 5 g L-1 of calcium formate. A 2 days immersion of the material gave the maximum weight increase of the specimens (38 +/- 19 mg) and this was likely due to the deposition of calcium carbonate, biomass, and unconverted calcium formate. The solid deposition mainly occurred in the micropores of the specimen, close to the outer surface. A significantly lower water absorption was observed in the bacterially treated specimens compared to the non-treated ones (up to 2.92 +/- 0.91 kg m(-2)) and this could be attributed to the solid deposition. However, the sonication test demonstrated that the bacterial treatment did not give a consolidating effect to the material. Overall, compared to the currently employed urea hydrolysis process, the formate-based MICP by M. parvus offers a more environmentally friendly approach for the biotechnological application to protect concrete.

TI Organic fuels oxidation: A common misunderstanding related to non-noble
   fuel cell catalysts
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB This opinion addresses a basic impossibility to use Nicontaining and similar mediator electrocatalysts for fuel cell anodes if the fuel is organic, and air (or oxygen) is the oxidant. The reason is that oxidation onset potential is always higher than O2/H2O equilibrium potential. These anodes can operate in fuel cells with peroxide, but the voltages reported for direct urea peroxide fuel cells demonstrate contradiction with urea oxidation onset potentials. Ni-containing anodes for "boosting" in water electrolysis and in electrochemical reforming present more heathy research branch.

TI Effect of support on the catalytic performance of Au-Co3O4 catalysts: An
   operando DRIFTS-MS study of the propane total oxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This study investigates the effect of different supports on the catalytic performance of Au-Co3O4 nanoparticles in the total oxidation of propane, aiming to understand the interaction between the supported gold and cobalt oxide particles and the role of the support in enhancing the catalytic activity. Catalysts were prepared via the sequential deposition-precipitation with urea method, with TiO2 and Al2O3 as supports. We found that the AuCo3O4/TiO2 system exhibited higher catalytic activity and lower activation energy, compared to AuCo3O4/ Al2O3. The enhanced performance of the AuCo3O4/TiO2 catalyst was attributed to the high mobility of surface oxygen species and the presence of oxygen vacancies. O perando DRIFTS-MS was used to characterize the intermediate species formed during the reaction. This technique revealed the presence of different intermediate species on the catalyst surfaces, with TiO2-supported catalysts showing enolate and carbonate adsorbed species at lower temperatures, enhancing the propane oxidation efficiency. In contrast, Al2O3-supported catalysts predominantly formed acetate adsorbed species at higher temperatures, indicating a less efficient oxidation process. The results demonstrated that the choice of support significantly affects the catalytic performance of Au-Co3O4 nanoparticles, with TiO2 providing superior oxyphility due to its reducibility and ability to promote the formation of active oxygen species. The study highlights the importance of the support material in the design of effective catalysts for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation.

TI The Influence of Cerium to Manganese Ratio and Preparation Method on the
   Activity of Ceria-Manganese Mixed Metal Oxide Catalysts for VOC Total
   Oxidation
SO CATALYSTS
AB A set of ceria-manganese mixed metal oxide catalysts with varying Ce:Mn ratios were prepared by coprecipitation using sodium carbonate and were evaluated for the total oxidation of propane and naphthalene. Manganese-rich samples were the most active, with Ce0.25Mn0.75Ox having the highest activity. Catalysts were characterised using X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, Raman spectroscopy, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), establishing that the high activity of Ce0.25Mn0.75Ox was due to the formation of phase-separated Mn-substituted ceria and Mn2O3 phases that were not simultaneously present in the other catalysts. The catalyst preparation technique for the most active ratio was investigated using co-precipitation by urea, oxalic acid and citric acid, and mechanochemical grinding. For propane, the mechanochemical and urea catalysts were more active than the carbonate coprecipitated catalyst, due to greater surface area and increased phase separation. This work demonstrates that ceria-manganese mixed metal oxides are more active than the parent oxide, but that preparation technique is also important for controlling activity.

TI Effect of sulfidation and phosphidation on Fe doped Co LDH/nickel foam
   for efficient multifunctional water splitting electrodes, urea oxidation
   reaction, and seawater splitting: An experimental and computational
   study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB In this work, the binder-free Fe-doped cobalt LDH/nickel foam (CoFe LDH/NF) electrode was prepared using the hydrothermal method. To achieve higher electrocatalyst activity of CoFe LDH/NF, sulfurization was conducted using the hydrothermal method, while the phosphidation was performed through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The CoFeS/NF and CoFeP/NF electrodes exhibited significantly higher electrocatalytic activity than CoFe LDH/NF electrode. The CoFeP/NF electrode with a specific surface area of 6.8 m(2) g(-1) had lower overpotentials of 120 and 236 mV for hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions, respectively. Additionally, the CoFeP/NF electrode exhibited a low potential of 1.32 V vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The CoFeP/NF electrode demonstrated low overpotentials of 224 and 273 mV in a seawater solution for HER and OER, respectively. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the experimental results in which the CoFeP/NF material had promising electrocatalytic activity for renewable energy applications.

TI Synthesis and characterization of N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
   and their application in photocatalytic oxidation of dibenzothiophene
   under visible light
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles, as a novel photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization, were synthesized via an ultrasonic assisted impregnation reaction method using urea as nitrogen source. The prepared sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV vis DRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Nitrogen doping caused a decrease in the crystallite size and an increase in the specific surface area. XPS and FT-IR results showed that N was successfully incorporated into the TiO2 lattice as substitutional and interstitial forms. The light absorption extended to the visible region with a red shift in absorption edge for the N TiO2 nanoparticles, which resulted in the enhancement of the visible light absorption. More surface hydroxyl groups were observed in the N-doped TiO2. Photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) in diesel model fuel under visible light irradiation and air bubbling was investigated using the N-doped TiO2 nanocatalyst for the first time. N TiO2 exhibited efficient and significant photocatalytic activity for DBT oxidation under visible light illumination in organic phase. The photo-oxidation products were determined using GC-MS analysis. A possible mechanism for the role of N-doped TiO2 in DBT oxidation under visible light irradiation was proposed. In addition, the kinetic studies revealed that the photocatalytic oxidation kinetics of DBT would follow a pseudo first order reaction. Finally, the stability and cyclic efficiency of the N-TiO2 photocatalyst were investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

TI Emissions of nitrous oxide and methane from rice field after granulated
   urea application with nitrification inhibitors and zeolite under
   different water managements
SO PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
AB A field experiment was carried out to determine the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) and yield of rice grains under water management of continuously flooded (CF) and non-continuously flooded (NCF) systems and to find out those were affected by both input of water managements in combination with urea granulated with nitrification inhibitors (neem and dicyandiamide) and zeolite. Urea combined with zeolite and nitrification inhibitors (NIs) reduced the emission of N2O in both plots of CF and NCF compared with urea alone, while the release of CH4 was induced, especially at CF plot. However, no differences existed in the emissions of N2O and CH4 between the types of urea granulated with zeolite and NIs and urea treatments in both water input managements. A paired comparison between CF and NCF plots revealed fewer emissions of N2O and CH4 in NCF plot with urea granulated with zeolite and neem treatments. Urea with zeolite and NIs did not have any effect on improving rice grain yield different from the effect of urea alone. The nitrogen use efficiency employed in this study had little effect on delayed oxidation of NH4+ in the soil of both plots of rice field. The study showed that the water management or practice of irrigation promises to reduce the emissions of N2O and CH4 compared to nitrogen use efficiency application.

SO DOKLADY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS
AB The effect on ozone-induced oxidation on the self-assembly of fibrin in the presence of fibrin-stabilizing factor FXIIIa of soluble cross-linked fibrin oligomers was studied in a medium containing moderate urea concentrations. It is established that fibrin oligomers were formed by the protofibrils cross-linked through gamma-gamma dimers and the fibrils additionally cross-linked by through alpha-polymers. The oxidation promoted both the accumulation of greater amounts of gamma-gamma dimers and the formation of protofibrils, fibrils, and their dissociation products emerging with increasing urea concentrations, which have a high molecular weight. It is concluded that the oxidation enhances the axial interactions between D-regions of fibrin molecules.

TI Anion doping and interfacial effects in
   B-Ni5P4/Ni2P for promoting
   urea-assisted hydrogen production in alkaline media
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB A bifunctional catalyst used for urea oxidation-assisted hydrogen production can efficiently catalyze the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) simultaneously, thus simplifying electrolytic cell installation and reducing the cost. Constructing the heterointerface of two components or species and doping heteroatom are effective strategies to improve the performance of electrocatalysts, which could regulate the local electronic structure of the catalysts at their interface region, adjust their orbital overlap, and achieve enhanced catalytic performance. In this study, a simple hydrothermal method was studied for the preparation of B-doped Ni5P4/Ni2P heterostructures on nickel foam (B-Ni5P4/Ni2P@NF). Under 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), an overpotential of 76 mV was obtained for the HER. When 0.3 M urea was added to 1 M KOH, the performance of the prepared catalyst was greatly improved. When the current density reached 10 mA cm(-2), the potential was only 1.35 V. In addition, urea-assisted overall water splitting voltage was only 1.41 V. Thus, the B-Ni5P4/Ni2P catalyst possess excellent electrocatalytic activity. The main reason for the excellent properties of the electrocatalyst is the construction of heterostructure, which regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst at its interface and generates a new efficient active site. In addition, the doping of B atoms further promotes the charge transfer rate, thus strengthening the interaction between two phases and improving the catalytic performance. This study provides a simple, environmentally friendly, and rapid design method to prepare an active bi-functional electrocatalyst that has a positive effect on urea-assisted overall water splitting.

TI Automated Model Calibration for Urea-SCR Systems Using Test-Rig Data
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems with urea injectors are widely utilized and can meet stricter NOx regulations for both light- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles. In this study, we propose a systematic parameter estimation strategy for a one-dimensional SCR model. Dual-site kinetics with 12 kinetic reactions and 28 kinetic parameters are considered in the SCR model. We estimate subsets of parameters sequentially since it is difficult to estimate all of the parameters at once. To this end, four test-rig experimental data obtained under ammonia storage, ammonia oxidation, nitrogen monoxide oxidation, and SCR reaction were used separately. We estimate a subset of parameters corresponding to the relevant reactions using each rig data because only some reactions occur under each rig experiment. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we estimate the parameters simultaneously using one set of real driving data and validate the model using a new set of real driving data that was not utilized for parameter estimation. With the prediction errors for the test set of real driving data, the proposed technique, which estimates a subset of parameters sequentially, has a 7.35% lower error.

TI Boosting eco-friendly hydrogen generation by urea-assisted water
   electrolysis using spinel M2GeO4 (M = Fe, Co) as
   an active electrocatalyst
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO
AB To enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production, bimetallic oxides with spinel structures, M2GeO4 (M = Fe, Co), were synthesized via a facile one-pot hydrothermal method and were used as electrocatalysts for urea-assisted water electrolysis. In alkaline electrolyte with urea, Fe2GeO4, which was used as the anode in the electrolysis cell, exhibited a lower potential (1.53 V (vs. RHE)) and a smaller Tafel slope (76 mV dec(-1)) Co2GeO4 (1.65 V (vs. RHE), 79 mV dec(-1)), indicating that Fe2GeO4 reduced the overall input potential to produce H-2. The superior performance of Fe2GeO4 in the urea-added water electrolysis was attributed to the higher oxidation state of its metal cations, larger electrochemical active surface area, and lower charge transfer resistance than those of Co2GeO4. Hence, Fe2GeO4 showed 5.49 times higher H-2 peak intensity than Co2GeO4, indicating higher efficiency of H-2 production.

TI Bell-shaped RuFe/Ni5P4 for efficient urea-assisted
   electrolytic hydrogen production
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Urea-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production requires much lower theoretical cell voltage than the conventional water splitting technology (E-theta = 0.37 V vs. 1.23 V), serving as a promising alternative for concepts of "clean energy" and "cleaning pollutant". However, screening highly robust catalysts with industrial-level current density (>200 mA cm(-2)) is still challenging. To overcome this challenge, bell-shaped RuFe/Ni5P4 catalysts grown on nickel foam (NF) were developed via dual doping of Fe and Ru and a facile phosphidation process. The unique bell-shaped structure significantly contributes to the improved contact with the electrolyte, leading to the promoted mass transfer as well as the efficient release of CO2 and N-2 bubbles generated during the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Moreover, the strong electronic interaction between Ru and Ni5P4 ensures high UOR activity with a high current density of 600 mA cm(-2) at 1.45 V (vs. RHE). Moreover, an assembled Ru/NF|KOH, CO(NH2)(2)|RuFe/Ni5P4 electrolytic cell demonstrated a highly efficient hydrogen production rate in order to reach a current density of 600 mA cm(-2) at a low overall voltage of 1.55 V. This superior performance substantially satisfies the industrial requirement and paves the way to an efficient catalyst design for the UOR and green hydrogen production.

TI Replacing Anodic Oxygen Evolution Reaction with Organic Oxidation: The
   Importance of Metal (Oxy)Hydroxide Formation as the Active Oxidation
   Catalyst
SO SYNLETT
AB Hybrid water electrolysis has been explored for the electrochemical oxidation of biomass, glucose, alcohols, amines, urea, etc. to produce value-added products. The integration of cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with anodic organic reaction (AOR) improves the energy efficiency of the electrolyzer by reducing the cell voltage of the overall process. Tremendous progress has been achieved in AOR by using transition-metal-based catalysts. These transition-metal-based catalysts undergo anodic activation in the alkali medium to form metal (oxy)hydroxide [M(O)(x)(OH)(y)] as the active catalyst. The atomic and electronic structure of M(O)(x)(OH)(y) essentially controls the conversion efficiency and product selectivity for AOR. In this Account, we have described the design of the AOR precatalyst, its anodic activation, and the basic principles of the integration of cathodic HER with AOR. The structural features of the precatalyst and the active catalyst have been described with representative examples. The recent progress and advancement in this field have been explained, and the future scope and challenges associated with AOR have been addressed.

TI Chemically and biologically activated biochars slow down urea hydrolysis
   and improve nitrogen use efficiency
SO PEDOSPHERE
AB Biochar is considered a potential technology to enhance chemical fertilizer use efficiency through intensification of the interactions between nutrients and the functional groups on biochar surfaces. However, little is known about how the application of activated biochars mixed with urea influences nitrogen (N) mineralization and crop performance in paddy fields. Here, a sawdust-derived fresh biochar (FBC) (ca. 400 degrees C) was activated chemically with 15% hydrogen peroxide and biologically with a nutrient solution mixed with a soil inoculum to obtain a chemically activated biochar (CBC) and a biologically activated biochar (BBC), respectively. The chemical and surface properties of FBC, CBC, and BBC were evaluated using spectroscopic methods, i.e., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and potentiometric charge determination. The N retention capacity of biochars and their interaction with urea hydrolysis were examined in a laboratory incubation experiment. Additionally, a field experiment was carried out in a paddy field with the biochars unmixed or mixed with urea at a 1:1 ratio. Our results showed that negative surface functional groups and negative charges were increased on both activated biochars, especially CBC. Both activated biochars contributed to a significant reduction in urea-biochar suspension pH and increased N retention in the incubation experiment. Despite the enhanced surface properties of the activated biochars, no similar increases in rice biomass and grain yield were observed for these biochars in the field experiment. However, rice biomass, grain yield, apparent N use efficiency, and agronomic N use efficiency were significantly higher with the application of the three biochars compared to no-biochar application. Altogether, the results indicate that the application of urea mixed with biochar could enhance crop performance, especially in the case of activated biochar, which would enhance N retention in the soil, reducing N loss.

TI From Deep Eutectic Solvents to Nitrogen-rich Ordered Mesoporous Carbons:
   A Powerful Host for the Immobilization of Palladium Nanoparticles in the
   Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB The preparation of a nitrogen-rich ordered mesoporous carbon (DNOMC) with three-dimensional cubic structure was established via carbonization of a green, inexpensive and safe deep eutectic solvent consisting of choline chloride salt and D-glucose in the presence of KIT-6 template for the first time. The materials were characterized by TEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis, XPS, TGA, CHN, and FT-IR. The DNOMC was shown to be a powerful support for the immobilization of palladium nanoparticles. The Pd@DNOMC catalyst exhibited high activity in the selective aerobic oxidation of various activated and non-activated primary and secondary benzylic as well as linear and cyclic aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding carboxylic acids and ketones in pure water under molecular oxygen. The catalyst system could successfully be reused at least ten times without any significant decrease in either activity or selectivity. It is worth noting that, the hot filtration strongly showed that the catalyst works in a boomerang-type catalyst pathway.

TI Improved reactivity for toluene oxidation on
   MnOx/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst by the
   synthesis of cubic-tetragonal interfaces
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB In this study, the CeO2-ZrO2 solid solutions with cubic-tetragonal interfaces were prepared by an urea hydrolysis method and a solvothermal method. Then they were used as the supports and Mn/Ce-Zr catalysts were prepared by impregnation method. The catalytic performance of the catalysts for toluene oxidation were evaluated by a steady-state measurement and compared with that of Mn/Ce-Zr-ss without the interfaces, in which the support was prepared by co-precipitation. The result was found that the catalyst interfaces apparently enhanced catalytic activity for toluene oxidation. The coexistence of cubic and tetragonal phases and their interfaces were confirmed by XRD and HRTEM. H-2-TPR and XPS results indicated that the cubic-tetragonal interfaces led to stronger interaction between surface Mn and Ce species and higher concentration of lattice oxygen produced from the catalyst surface. DRIFT spectra revealed that the catalyst interface promoted the adsorption of toluene and the formation of key intermediates at low temperatures. These would be important factors that caused a higher activity of the catalyst with cubic-tetragonal interfaces. Moreover, the promoting role of the interfaces might be related to the morphology, surface area and interface components of Ce-Zr supports.

TI Facile Synthesis of Porous Pd3Pt Half-Shells with Rich
   "Active Sites" as Efficient Catalysts for Formic Acid Oxidation
SO SMALL
AB Exploring highly efficient electrocatalysts is greatly important for the widespread uptake of the fuel cells. However, many newly generated nanocrystals with attractive nanostructures often have extremely limited surface area or large particle-size, which leads them to display limited electrocatalytic performance. Herein, a novel anode catalyst of hollow and porous Pd3Pt half-shells with rich "active sites" is synthesized by using urea as a guiding surfactant. It is identified that the formation of Pd3Pt half-shells involves the combination of bubble guiding, in situ deposition of particles and bubble burst. The obtained Pd3Pt half-shells demonstrate a rich edge area with abundant exposed active sites and surface defects, indicating great potential for the electrocatalysis. When used as an electrocatalyst, the Pd3Pt half-shells exhibit remarkably improved electrocatalytic performance for formic acid oxidation (FAO), where it promotes the dehydrogenation process of FAO by suppressing the formation of poisonous species COads via the electronic effect and ensemble effect.

TI Encapsulation of urea and caffeine in Cu3(BTC)2
   metal-organic framework
SO SURFACE INNOVATIONS
AB The Cu-3(BTC)(2) metal-organic framework (MOF) (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), also known as HKUST-1 (or MOF-199), is one of the most studied MOFs because it has a large surface area, high pore volume, high chemical stability and the ability to bind water, among other molecules, by coordinating to the unsaturated Cu(II) sites. In this study, Cu-3(BTC)(2) was used for the first time to remove the pharmaceutical products of urea and caffeine. Two strategies for retention of urea and caffeine in Cu-3(BTC)(2) were studied. The first strategy corresponds to in situ encapsulation, where urea and caffeine were added to Cu-3(BTC)(2) synthesis precursors and the porous structure was formed around the urea or caffeine molecules resulting in the encapsulation. The second one corresponds to post-synthesis encapsulation. The adsorption of urea or caffeine in MOF structure was realized by adding the as-synthesized dry Cu-3(BTC)(2) into urea or caffeine aqueous solution. The results show that in situ encapsulation of caffeine and urea in Cu-3(BTC)(2) produced a guest loading of 38 and 25 wt%, respectively, whereas, post-synthesis encapsulation had a guest loading of 52 and 30 wt% for caffeine and urea, respectively.

TI A branch-like Mo-doped Ni3S2 nanoforest as a
   high-efficiency and durable catalyst for overall urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Design and fabrication of high-efficiency electrocatalysts are important to generate hydrogen via urea electrocatalysis with the minimum required energy. In this study, in situ growth of a branch-like Mo-doped Ni3S2 nanoforest on Ni foam was achieved through a facile one-pot hydrothermal process. The as-obtained catalyst exhibited excellent activity and robust durability because of its unique hierarchical nanostructures and doping-optimized electronic structural configuration, and required merely 1.33 V (vs. RHE) and 90 mV (overpotential) to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), without any noticeable loss in activity even after 120 h of operation. On the basis of the experimental results and theoretical calculations, it was confirmed that the incorporation of Mo in Ni3S2 altered the morphology and electronic structure of the catalyst; hence, more active sites were exposed and the Gibbs adsorption energy of the intermediates in the UOR was optimized. Notably, the overall urea electrolysis cell could afford a low voltage of 1.45 V (vs. RHE) to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and showed excellent durability over 120 h. The findings from this study provide new insights into efficient electrocatalysts for urea electrolyzers, which hold great potential in electrochemical energy conversion and sewage treatment applications.

TI Amide- and Urea-Based Solvents for Li-O2 Batteries. Part I: Experimental
   Evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries have the potential to aid in the electrification of our society due to their relatively high theoretical energy density. Unfortunately, the technology suffers from large degrees of irreversibility due to the aggressive chemical environment associated with the oxidation of the discharge product lithium peroxide. Herein, we present a study of a range of linear and cyclic amides and ureas as aprotic electrolyte solvents for the Li-O2 battery, some of which show slight increases in reversibility relative to the well-established pseudo-stable glymes, although we find that none provide reversibility necessary to enable a rechargeable system. Using quantitative differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, acid titrations, and isotopic labeling of O2 and carbon in the positive electrode, we provide insight into the degradation pathways for these solvents. In the companion article, we compare our experimental results presented here to solvent decomposition pathways including a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation mechanism.

TI Facile fabrication of size-controlled Pd nanoclusters supported on
   Al2O3 as excellent catalyst for solvent-free
   aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) to benzaldehyde is one of the most important organic transformations. It is vital to explore a stable, economic and highly efficient catalyst. Here, Pd/R-Al2O3 (R = Al (NO3)(3)/urea molar ratio) was prepared by hydrothermal process followed by cation-assisted polyol method, and utilized for solvent-free aerobic oxidation of BzOH without any additives. Characterization results from TEM, NH3/CO2/O-2-TPD and XPS showed that the size of Pd nanoclusters on Pd/R-Al2O3 was controlled by base number on R-Al2O3, and the order of oxygen mobility was Pd/1:6-Al2O3 > Pd/1:7-Al2O3 > Pd/1:8-Al2O3 > Pd/ 1:9-Al2O3. In the BzOH oxidation, R-Al2O3 as a basic additive could improve the benzaldehyde selectivity, and all surface atoms of Pd nanoclusters displayed the same catalytic activity. Excellent oxygen mobility indicated a high catalytic performance since it accelerated oxygen transfer from gaseous molecular oxygen to the surface of Pd nanoclusters to rapidly regenerate active Pd0 species. Among Pd/R-Al2O3 catalysts, Pd/1:6-Al2O3 exhibited a turnover frequency of 70381 h-1 due to the smallest Pd size and the best oxygen mobility, and good stability after five recycles owing to the strong interaction between Pd0 species and R-Al2O3. Therefore, Pd/R-Al2O3 may be great potential as a promising candidate for numerous catalytic reactions.

TI Urea-nitrates combustion preparation of CeO2-promoted
   CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst for fuel cell grade
   hydrogen production via methanol steam reforming
SO ADVANCED POWDER TECHNOLOGY
AB A series CuO/ZnO/CeO2/Al2O3 nanocatalysts were synthesized by the urea-nitrates combustion method for production of hydrogen through the steam reforming of methanol process. The fabricated nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, TEM, BET and FTIR techniques. XRD and EDX analyses illustrated that the nanocatalysts were synthesized properly while CuO and ZnO particles had uniformly been dispersed. The crystallinity of CuO and ZnO crystallites were decreased slightly by increasing of CeO2 loadings. On the other hand, their surface area was not affected by cerium oxide loadings. The nanocatalysts particle size was distributed in the range of 11.9-54.2 nm and more than 95% of particles were below 40 nm. The catalytic performance experiments showed the sample containing 10% of CeO2 had higher methanol conversion and H-2 selectivity due to its better physicochemical properties. Furthermore, a reaction mechanism is developed to address the major routes for hydrogen production. (C) 2016 The Society of Powder Technology Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Facile preparation of three-dimensional Ni(OH)2/Ni foam anode
   with low cost and its application in a direct urea fuel cell
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Three-dimensional Ni(OH)(2)/Ni foam electrodes with low cost are simply fabricated via a template-free growth method and employed as efficient anodes for a direct urea-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (DUPFC). The surface morphologies of Ni(OH)(2) catalysts on the electrodes can be easily controlled by altering the reaction temperatures. The nano-sheet (NS) Ni(OH)(2)/Ni foam electrode exhibits highest catalytic activity towards urea electro-oxidation among the four electrodes. The oxidation current density of the NS Ni(OH)(2)/Ni foam electrode reaches 337 mA cm(-2) at 0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a low onset oxidation potential in 0.6 mol L-1 urea and 5 mol L-1 KOH solutions. The DUPFC using NS Ni(OH)(2)/Ni foam anode shows an open circuit voltage of 0.86 V and high peak power density of 19.7 mW cm(-2) and 28.8 mW cm(-2) at 20 degrees C and 50 degrees C, respectively, which is much higher than the performance of direct urea fuel cells reported previously. The outstanding cell performance using a cheap NS Ni(OH)(2)/Ni foam anode indicates DUPFC is a promising new type of fuel cell.

TI Study on the Effect of Niobium on the High Temperature Oxidation
   Resistance of Ferritic Stainless Steel
SO METALS
AB More and more cars are installing urea selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to solve the problem of exhaust emissions, which often operates at high temperatures in the exhaust system and is prone to failure of the exhaust pipe due to high-temperature oxidation. And niobium containing ferritic stainless steel has been widely used in the manufacturing of automotive exhaust pipes. In order to extend the service life of ferrite stainless steel exhaust pipes, niobium plays a crucial role as an added alloying element. The solid solution and precipitation of niobium in ferritic stainless steel will give ferritic stainless steel more excellent high temperature resistance. The precipitation of Nb can change the organizational structure in steel and refine the grains. However, if the content is not properly controlled, large particles of (Nb, Ti) C will precipitate, which will reduce the high temperature oxidation resistance. In this paper, the high temperature oxidation behavior of two kinds of ferritic stainless steels with different Nb content at 700 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C was studied. The microstructure of the oxide film on the surface of the material, the thickness of the oxide layer on the cross section, the distribution of chemical composition, the existence form and distribution of Nb element were analyzed by SEM, EDS, XRD and TEM. The results show that the higher the niobium content, the better the high temperature oxidation resistance, and the higher the temperature, the more obvious the high temperature oxidation resistance of niobium. This is because the high Nb content steel is easy to precipitate NbN and other Nb-containing precipitates at the grain boundary, which is helpful to the high temperature resistance. In the case of less Nb content, its ability to generate (Nb, Ti) C precipitates and coarsen at high temperatures reduces its high-temperature resistance.

TI Mitigation of ammonia volatilisation from urea with micronised sulfur
   applied to common bean
SO SOIL RESEARCH
AB Urea with micronised sulfur (S) in granules may result in lower nitrogen (N) depletion through ammoniacal N (NH3-N) loss than conventional urea due to the acidification reaction of S near urea granules in soil, and the addition of S to the urea may provide a limiting nutrient in tropical soils. The research objectives were to (1) verify whether urea containing micronised S (urea+S) can mitigate NH3-N volatilisation in comparison to conventional urea, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate; and (2) evaluate the efficiency of N and S sources for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown on coarse-, medium-, and fine-textured soil. The results showed that 90% of NH3-N volatilisation occurred during the first 14 days after application. The blend of elemental sulfur and sulfate in urea reduces the loss of N by NH3-N volatilisation compared with regular urea but not enough to achieve the low volatilisation as observed for ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate application. Despite the differences in the leaf N and S concentration and bean yield components, no differences were observed among N sources in grain yield in general.

TI Can Micronized Sulfur in Urea Reduce Ammoniacal Nitrogen Volatilization
   and Improve Maize Grain Yield?
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB Micronized sulfur (S) in urea may reduce nitrogen (N) loss by ammoniacal N (NH3-N) volatilization and provide a better use for S from oil refineries, thereby improving plant nutrition by providing N and S. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of urea micronized with S (urea+S) to mitigate NH3-N volatilization and the efficiency of the urea+S as source of N and S for maize (Zea mays L.). Three field experiments were implemented, with maize grown in coarse-, medium-, and fine-textured soils and the following treatments: urea, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, urea+S enhanced with 13% elemental S (urea+S-A), urea+S with 4% elemental S and 9% S in sulfate form (urea+S-B), and a control without N application. The leaf N concentrations increased similarly for all the N sources. The leaf S concentrations were greater when the ammonium sulfate and urea+S were applied. The use of micronized S does not decrease the NH3-N volatilization from urea side-dress applied to maize. However, in comparison with ammonium sulfate, the urea+S are a viable alternative for supplying N and S to maize because of their greater operational efficiencies and due to their high N concentrations.

TI Structural and Thermal Characterization of Chemically Pretreated and
   Thermally Oxidized Bamboo Fiber in Activated Carbon Fiber Manufacturing
SO JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS
AB The transformations of structural and thermal properties of bamboo precursor fiber impregnated with diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP), sodium metasilicate, and urea (in brief DAP-SMSU) throughout the oxidative thermal stabilization process were studied. The oxidation of bamboo fiber was performed for different oxidation duration from 40 to 120 minutes at temperatures up to 245 degrees C utilizing a multistep stabilization strategy. X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to characterize the structure and properties of oxidized bamboo fibers. The outcomes indicate that DAP-SMSU integration greatly influenced enhancing the thermal stability of bamboo fibers. The findings of the XRD analysis revealed that the amorphization process with increasing stabilization time resulted in the loss of crystallinity and in the growing transformation to a significantly cross-linked and cyclized structure. TGA study revealed that DAP-SMSU pretreatment improved thermal stability by forming a growing amount of ladder-like structures comprising aromatic substances. The drop of crystallinity with time was observed by IR spectra, corroborating the results of X-ray diffraction studies. The development of double-bonded C = C was also observed in IR spectra, which was ascribed to the creation of a cross-linked ladder-like structure.

AB The targeted compounds were prepared using both (9H-fluoren-9-ylidene)hydrazine (1) and 10H-phenothiazine (2) as starting materials. The treatment of 1 or 2 with different isocyanates afforded the title compounds 7a-d, 8a, and 8b in excellent yield. All compounds were characterized and ascertained by infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and elemental analyses as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The antimicrobial efficiency of all was tested in vitro, and a noticeable inhibition activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans was obtained by compounds 7a, 7b, 8a, and 8b. Moreover, the biofilm mechanism activity was strongly inhibited by compounds 7b and 8b for all bacterial pathogens, with a percentage ratio of more than 55%. The findings from the molecular docking simulation revealed that compounds 7a, 7b, 8a, and 8b exhibited favorable binding energies and interacted effectively with the active sites of sterol 14-demethylase, dihydropteroate synthase, gyrase B, LasR (major transcriptional activator of P. aeruginosa), and carbapenemase for C. albicans, S. aureus, B. subtills, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa, respectively. These results suggest that the compounds have the potential to inhibit the activity of these enzymes and demonstrate promising antimicrobial properties. Moreover, the in silico evaluation of drug likeness and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiles for compounds 7a, 7b, 8a, and 8b demonstrated their compatibility with Lipinski's, Ghose's, Veber's, Muegge's, and Egan's rules. These findings suggest that these compounds possess favorable physicochemical properties, making them promising candidates for continued drug development efforts.

TI NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF nanohybrids as a high-performance bifunctional
   electrocatalyst for overall urea electrolysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB It is crucial for the storage and conversion of hydrogen energy to substitute the low theoretical potential of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for the high theoretical potential of anodic water electrolysis (oxygen evolution reaction (OER)). In this paper, it puts forward a brief and scalable strategy, so as to synthesize a novel bifunctional nickel-iron layered double hydroxide and multi-walled carbon nanotube composites supported on Ni foam, represented as NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF is able to realize an efficient electrocatalysis for UOR. During this process, merely a potential of 1.335 V is needed at 10 mA cm(-2), which can be taken to replace OER, thus reducing overpotential in H-2-production as well as power consumption. In addition, NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF also exhibits electro-defense electrocatalytic efficiency to achieve the reaction of hydrogen evolving process, which provides a low overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). To further prove it, all-water-urea electrolysis measurement is carried out in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M Urea with NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF as cathode and anode respectively. NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF parallel to NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF electrode manages to provide 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of merely 1.507 V, 156 mV lower than that of water splitting, which proves its commercial viability in energy-saving hydrogen production.

TI Peculiarities of Carbamide Hydrolysis and Oxidation in a Water-Oxygen
   Fluid
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB The transformations of carbamide in a water-oxygen fluid (at a carbamide concentration of 0.29-0.39 mol/L, oxygen excess coefficient OR = 0.98-1.25, mole fraction of water 70.0-91.3%) are studied in a batch reactor when heated to 873 K at a rate of 1 K/min. It is shown that the transformations proceed via the mechanism of parallel and sequential reactions, including carbamide hydrolysis, formation and decomposition of cyanuric acid, oxidation of ammonia and products of the decomposition of cyanuric acid. From the analysis of the time dependencies of temperature and pressure, it follows that the oxidation of carbamide occurs predominantly heterogeneously on the surfaces of the reactor wall and the Pt-Rh/Pt-thermocouple inserted into the center of the reaction volume. It is established that excess oxygen (OR = 1.25) or the addition of NaOH leads to an increase in the fraction of nitrogen converted into N2 and prevents the formation of cyanuric acid. The influence of the concentration of reagents on the ratio of carbamide conversion pathways and the dynamics of heat release is discussed.

TI Cobalt Incorporation Promotes CO2 Desorption from Nickel
   Active Sites Encapsulated by Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotubes in
   Urea-Assisted Water Electrolysis
SO LANGMUIR
AB The potential application prospects of urea-assisted water electrolysis toward hydrogen production in renewable energy infrastructure can effectively alleviate energy shortages and environmental pollution caused by rich urea wastewater. It is of prominent significance that adjusting the CO2 desorption of nickel-based electrocatalysts can overcome the slow reaction kinetics for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to achieve exceptional catalytic activity. In this work, cobalt (Co) metal doping is employed to boost the UOR performance of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulating nickel nanoparticle electrocatalysts (Ni@N-CNT). The influence of diverse Co doping concentrations on the performance of UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activities associated with stability are systematically investigated. The Co dopant can effectively promote the dynamical conversion of Ni to Ni3+ species; as a result, the UOR catalytic activity is improved by 1.8-fold at 1.6 V vs RHE. The DFT calculation results show that the CoNi bimetallic structure possesses a comparably lower binding energy for CO2 adsorption accelerating the rate-limiting step. Meanwhile, the Co dopant also boosts the HER performance, achieving a 57 mV reduction in overpotential at 100 mA cm-2 due to the creation of more active sites. In addition, the assembled urea-assisted water electrolysis attains 10 mA cm-2 at merely 1.51 V as well as excellent stability.

In this communication, we report the development of a porous Ni3N nanosheet array on carbon cloth (Ni3N NA/CC) as a high-performance and durable electrocatalyst for urea oxidation. To drive 10 mA cm(-2), this Ni3N NA/CC only demands a potential of 1.35 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. The high catalytic activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction enables Ni3N NA/CC as a bifunctional catalyst electrode for electrochemical hydrogen production and the two-electrode electrolyzer is capable of offering 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.44 V, 120 mV less than that for the ureafree counterpart.

TI The Effect of the Preparation Method of Pd-Doped Cobalt Spinel on the
   Catalytic Activity in Methane Oxidation Under Lean Fuel Conditions
SO TOPICS IN CATALYSIS
AB In this work a series of cobalt spinel catalysts was synthesized by different methods and doped with 1 wt% of palladium via incipient wetness impregnation or solution combustion synthesis (SCS). Both undoped and Pd-doped spinels were characterized from the structural and surface point of view (XRD, XRF, mu RS, BET, FESEM) and tested toward the oxidation of methane in lean conditions, in gas mixtures containing from 0.5 to 2 vol% of CH4. These methane concentrations are typical of processes involving combustion of CH4 in lean conditions as the after-treatment of unconverted CH4 in compressed natural gas-fed vehicle exhausts, or the treatment of fugitive CH4 from leaks in coal mines. The temperature window for the catalytic activity of the undoped Co3O4 materials spread from 350 to 600 A degrees C. The preparation method affected the catalytic activity of undoped Co3O4, with the best catalytic activity related to the spinel prepared by SCS employing urea. The addition of 1 wt% of Pd lowered the temperature window for the catalytic activity to the range of 250-500 A degrees C, with insignificant differences for the various preparation methods. The beneficial effect of Pd-doping was assigned to the enhancement of the reduction of cobalt in the oxide structure.

TI Strongly Coupled Heterostructured CoP/MoO2 as an Advanced
   Electrocatalyst for Urea-Assisted Water Electrolysis
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Developing low-cost electrocatalysts with excellent activity and durability in urea-assisted water splitting is urgently needed in order to achieve sustainable hydrogen production. Herein, we in situ synthesized a robust coupled heterostructured electrocatalyst (CoP/MoO2) on a nickel foam (NF) substrate and explored its electrocatalytic performances in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The overpotential of CoP/MoO2/NF is found to be only 11 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) during the HER process, which is significantly lower than that of commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the UOR catalytic performance of CoP/MoO2/NF indicates fast reaction kinetics, along with a considerable low driving potential (1.26 V) compared to that of the OER (1.51 V). In situ and ex situ techniques demonstrate that these excellent electrocatalytic properties are mainly ascribed to the effective synergistic coupled effect and strong electronic interactions between single-component CoP and MoO2, which can tune electronic states of Co and Mo, expose more active sites, enhance intrinsic catalytic activity, and accelerate charge transfer. Moreover, when used in electrochemical overall water splitting and urea-assisted water electrolysis, CoP/MoO2/NF can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.46 and 1.32 V. This outperforms Pt/C||RuO2 and numerous nonprecious metal electrocatalysts and maintains a stable long-term electrolytic operation for 84 h. This work provides a promising pathway for the development of efficient catalysts during urea-assisted water electrolysis for hydrogen production.

TI Conductive network construction and electrocatalytic performance of
   phosphorus-doped nickel-based bamboo fiber film flexible electrodes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Bamboo fiber has attracted attention due to its high strength and flexibility, but it shows poor electron mobility and functionalities. In this research, phosphorus-doped flexible electrodes were constructed using bamboo fiber as the substrate, which was pretreated using sodium borohydride, followed by chemical nickel plating, and then used for urea electrocatalytic oxidation. The results showed that the bamboo fiber film provided a flexible support for nickel metal loading and a uniform and dense metal coating. Along with phosphorus self-doping, this conferred significant electrocatalytic activity to the nickel-phosphorus/bamboo fiber film (Ni-P/BFF). Notably, the electrode demonstrated an initial oxidation potential of 436.4 mV during urea oxidation. Phosphorus doping induced charge density redistribution and changed the electronic states during chemical plating, making the area around nickel atoms effective electron-trapping centers. This lowered the free energy of OH- adsorption on the surface of the conductive network in the electrolyte, which in turn lowered the onset potential and Tafel slope. These findings present a novel perspective for using biomass materials to create flexible electrodes.

TI Highly active Ru/TiO2 nanostructures for total catalytic
   oxidation of propane
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Ruthenium is a robust catalyst for a variety of applications in environmental heterogeneous catalysis. The catalytic performance of Ru/TiO2 materials, synthesized by using the deposition precipitation with urea method, was assessed in the catalytic oxidation of C3H8, varying the ruthenium loading. The highest catalytic reactivity was obtained for a Ru loading of 2 wt. % in comparison with the 1, 1.5, 3, and 4 wt. % Ru catalysts. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized materials were investigated by XRD, N-2 adsorption, TEM, FT-IR pyridine, H-2-TPR, and XPS. The size of ruthenium particles was found to be greatly dependent on the pretreatment gas (air or hydrogen) and the catalytic activity was enhanced by the small-size ruthenium metal nanoparticles, leading to changes in the reduction degree of ruthenium, which also increased the Bronsted and Lewis acidity. Metal to support charge transfer enhanced the reactant adsorption sites while oxygen vacancies on the interface enabled the dissociation of O-2 molecules as revealed through DFT calculations. The outstanding catalytic activity of the 2Ru/TiO2 catalysts allowed to convert C3H8 into CO2 at reaction temperatures of about 100 & DEG;C. This high activity may be attributed to the metal/support interaction between Ru and TiO2, which promoted the reducibility of Ti4+/Ti3+ and Ru4+/Ru-0 species, and to the fast migration of TiO2 lattice oxygen in the catalyst. Furthermore, the Ru/TiO2 catalyst exhibited high stability and reusability for 30 h under reaction conditions, using a GHSV of 45,000 h(-1). The underlying alkane-metal interactions were explored theoretically in order to explain the C-H bond activation in propane by the catalyst.

TI Etched High-Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues as Trifunctional Catalysts
   for Water, Ethanol, and Urea Electrooxidation
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB NH3 & BULL;H2O-etchedhigh-entropy PBAsare constructed to function as a trifunctional catalyst toward electrocatalyticOER, EOR, and UOR.
   The introduction of high-entropy and high specific surfaceareainto Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to create interest inthe field of electrocatalytic small-molecule oxidation reactions.Herein, we synthesize a novel class of high-entropy (HE) PBAs witha high specific surface area via a simple NH3 & BULL;H2O-etching strategy and systematically investigate the electrocatalyticperformance of HE-PBA toward electrocatalytic water, ethanol, andurea oxidation reactions. Importantly, the NH3 & BULL;H2O-etched HE-PBA (denoted as HE-PBA-e) demonstrated enhancedelectrocatalytic performance toward small-molecule oxidation comparedto the pristine HE-PBA, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) withpotentials of 1.56, 1.41, and 1.37 V for the oxygen evolution reaction(OER), ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), and urea oxidation reaction(UOR), respectively. Deep characterizations suggest that the NH3 & BULL;H2O etching treatment not only creates richnanopores to enlarge the surface area and boosts the mass transportand electron transfer but also facilitates the formation of high-valencemetal oxides to improve the intrinsic activity. This demonstrationof how systematically increasing the high oxidation state of metalswill serve as a governing principle for the rational design of moreadvanced HE-PBAs toward the electrooxidation of small molecules.

TI Growth competition between ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria for
   ammonium and urea in a biological activated carbon filter used for
   drinking water treatment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB Nitrification is a major ecological process occurring in biological activated carbon (BAC) filters used for advanced drinking water treatment. Ammonia oxidation is a rate-limiting step in nitrification that depends on the activity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) associated with BAC. However, the growth competition between AOA and AOB remains unclear. In this study, time-course DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) was applied to compare the growth activities of AOA and AOB for ammonium and urea in a BAC filter, in which AOA were more abundant than AOB. When a low level of ammonium (0.14 mg N L-1) was continuously supplied to BAC, AOA demonstrated higher autotrophic growth activity. A similar trend was noticed in a microcosm supplied with a low concentration of urea (0.14 mg N L-1) and C-13-labeled bicarbonate ((HCO3-)-C-13). However, the microcosm supplied with only C-13-urea as the sole nitrogen and carbon source indicated faster assimilation of carbon derived from urea by AOB. It is likely that AOB could directly incorporate and hydrolyze urea for nitrification. On the other hand, AOA demonstrated growth activity only when bicarbonate was added to urea, suggesting that they did not directly incorporate urea for nitrification. Thus, the different substrate affinities of AOA and AOB to ammonium and urea seem to be the reason for the niche separation on BAC. Understanding the different responses of ammonia oxidizers to nitrogen substrates may contribute to the improvement of BAC design and operation in actual advanced drinking water treatment.

TI NiCo-Based Heterostructure on Nickel Foam for Boosting Urea-Assisted
   Electrolytic Hydrogen Production
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Urea-assisted electrolytic water splitting is recognized as a high-efficiency and energy-saving hydrogen production technology because of its advantages of reducing the thermodynamic electrode potential and decomposing pollutant. Furthermore, the reasonably designed heterojunction catalyst can significantly accelerate the kinetic rate of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this paper, a four-component (including NiCo, NiCoP, Ni3Se2, and NiSe) NiCo-based heterostructure (expressed as NixSey/NC-NCP) was successfully synthesized by combining the electrodeposition method and high-temperature selenization strategy, which consists of an interlaced chainlike structure and an interconnected nanosphere structure. As expected, the NixSey/NC-NCP heterostructure only requires a low potential of 1.36 V to enable the UOR to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), which is 208 mV lower than that of the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results of physical characterizations confirm that the surface of NixSey/NC-NCP was reconstructed during the electrocatalytic UOR process; that is, active species such as CoOOH and NiOOH were generated on the surface. The Pt/C||NixSey/NC-NCP electrolyzer composed of commercial Pt/C and self-supporting NixSey/NC-NCP is used for the urea-assisted water splitting, which only needs low cell voltages of 1.40 and 1.45 V to drive the current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. This study promotes research on hierarchical heterojunction catalysts to enhance the electrocatalytic UOR performance, effectively reducing the energy required for electrochemical hydrogen production.

TI Double surface modification of graphite felt using a single facile step
   for electrolytic hydrogen production assisted by urea
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Graphite felt (GF) is modified electrochemically using a facile controllable method via scanning the potential from +2 to -1.5 V in solutions containing various NiCl2 concentrations. By increasing the NiCl2 amount, the anodic oxidation and cathodic deposition processes are enhanced, and the GF surface is simultaneously func-tionalized. Firstly, at a high positive potential, GF' functionalization occurs by making a defect in the carbon framework. Then, at a high negative potential, the rate of hydrogen evolution increases and produces a strong homogeneously uniform Ni(OH)2 coating at the GF surface. Modified GF is examined by SEM, mapping EDX, HR-TEM, XPS, XRD, Raman, and contact angle measurements. Interestingly, the Ni(OH)2 film deposited at GF from 100 mM NiCl2 solution (Ni(OH)2/GF-100) enhances the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium by deriving a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of 69 mV which approaches the value of the benchmark catalyst. Additionally, the Ni(OH)2/GF-100 electrode supports urea oxidation as it drives a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of 1.38 V vs RHE. Therefore, Ni(OH)2/GF-100 is used as a bifunctional catalyst to replace the unfavourable anodic reaction (oxygen evolution reaction) with urea oxidation. Further-more, a two electrode cell for urea electrolysis displays a cell voltage of 1.47 V, which is lower than that of water splitting by about 270 mV, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and shows superb stability over a prolonged electrolysis time of 24 h. So, this approach introduces an energy-saving route.

TI Interfacial engineering of two-dimensional NiS2/VS heterostructure
   nanosheets as bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea-assisted
   energy-saving water electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Heterostructure electrocatalysts based on transition metal sulfides (TMS) have been extensively applied in renewable energy research because the rich interfaces afford high intrinsic activities for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we have fabricated two-dimensional (2D) nickel sulfide and vanadium sulfide heterojunction nanosheets (NiS2/VS-3:1) arranged on carbon cloth as efficient bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting. The strong electronic interaction be-tween NiS2 and VS in the NiS2/VS-3:1 heterostructure nanosheets was beneficial to tune the electronic structures and induce the formation of dual-functional reactive sites (Ni3+ for OER and V2+ for HER) in one heterojunction electrocatalyst, contributing to the promising catalytic activities toward electrocatalytic water splitting. The NiS2/VS-3:1 electrocatalyst has exhibited prominent catalytic activities toward HER and OER, which required low overpotentials of 74 and 235 mV to yield the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH. Compared with pure NiS2 or VS, the NiS2/VS-3:1 electrocatalyst delivered faster reaction kinetics, improved electron-transfer ability, and enlarged electrochemical active surface area, which were mainly attributed to the fascinating heterostructure in the nanosheets. Some more easily oxidized substances have been added into electrolyte as adjuvants to realize energy-saving hydrogen production, pollutant de -gradation, and biomass upgrading.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Photoelectrochemical advanced oxidation processes for simultaneous
   removal of antibiotics and heavy metal ions in wastewater using 2D-on-2D
   WS2@CoFe2O4 heteronanostructures
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB The presence of antibiotics in water poses significant threats to both human health and the environment. Addressing this issue requires the effective treatment of medical wastewater. Photoelectrochemical advanced oxidation processes (PEAOPs) are emerging as promising solutions for wastewater treatment. This process utilizes photocatalysts to convert charge carriers into reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide ions, which are essential for degrading pollutants in wastewater. However, limitations in charge carrier separation and transport have hindered the efficiency of photoelectrochemical advanced oxidation processes. To overcome these limitations, we designed WS2@CoFe2O4 heterojunctions, optimizing their energy levels to enhance charge transport and separation. This improvement significantly increased the oxidation of antibiotics such as amoxicillin and azithromycin. Multiple reactions occurred at the WS2@CoFe2O4 heterojunctions during photoelectrochemical advanced oxidation processes, leading to the impressive degradation of up to 99% of antibiotics under visible light irradiation at 0.8 V. Urea and H2O2 acted as oxidation agents within photoelectrochemical advanced oxidation processes, amplifying the generation of hydroxyl radicals and superoxide ions, further enhancing antibiotic oxidation. Moreover, the WS2@CoFe2O4 photoanode efficiently oxidized toxic antibiotics while converting As(III) into the less harmful As(V). Crucially, recyclability tests confirmed the robustness of the WS2@CoFe2O4 photoanode, ensuring its suitability for prolonged use in photoelectrochemical advanced oxidation processes. Integrating WS2@CoFe2O4 photoanodes into water purification systems can enhance efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and improve economic viability. This technology's scalability and its ability to protect ecosystems while conserving water resources make it a promising solution for addressing the critical issue of antibiotic pollution in water environments.

TI Photocatalytic Chemoselective Aerobic Oxidation of Thiols to Disulfides
   Catalyzed by Combustion Synthesized Bismuth Tungstate Nanoparticles in
   Aqueous Media
SO JOURNAL OF CLUSTER SCIENCE
AB Bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) nanoparticles were synthesized by solution combustion synthesis method using different N-containing organic compounds as fuels (urea, glycine, hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), malonic acid dihydrazide (MDH)). The Bi2WO6 nanoparticles have been characterized using XRD, UV-Vis-DRS, photoluminescence, FESEM, HRTEM and sorptometric techniques. Glycine as fuel was effective for synthesis of phase pure Bi2WO6 nanoparticles. Employing HMTA and MDH as fuel lead to mixed phase complex oxide system with Bi14W2O27 as minor (impurity) phase. The nature of the fuel significantly influences the particle size and morphology. Formation of spherical, flake like and elongated polyhedral particles were observed in FESEM study depending upon the nature of the fuel. TEM study of Bi2WO6 prepared using glycine fuel depicted the presence of spherical particles with size in the range of 5-8 nm. The Bi2WO6 nanoparticles were used as an efficient photocatalyst for the visible light driven chemoselective oxidation of substituted thiophenols to disulfide using air as oxidant. The effect of various reaction parameters such as catalyst amount, reaction media, time, along with catalyst recyclability were studied in detail. Structurally diverse diphenyl disulfide moieties were obtained in high yield and excellent selectivity within a time span of 6 h of visible light irradiation.

TI The novel dual-category active sites of NiCoP/CoP as high-performance
   electrocatalyst for urea electrolysis and synergistic hydrogen
   production
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Combining the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) instead of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising method to generate H-2 with low-energy absorption and alleviate the environmental impact of urea wastewater. The unique "Fistular onion flower" NiCoP/CoP was synthesized at different temperatures, denoted as CNCP-T (T indicates the temperature, T = 200, 300, 350, and 400 degrees C). Significantly, NiCoP/CoP overcomes the limitation of a single type of active site for the catalyst, and the combination of CoP and NiCoP could provide two different types of active sites for applications in UOR. The dual-category active sites of CNCP-350 demonstrate highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity in the UOR and HER. Particularly, in the urea electrolyzer (HER||UOR), CNCP-350||CNCP-350 exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.355 V at 10 mA cm(-2). In this work, we achieve efficient UOR to assist in hydrogen production by implementing a synergistic strategy of dual-category active sites and demonstrate its potential feasibility for practical applications in efficient hydrogen production technology.

TI Effect of Gold Electronic State on the Catalytic Performance of Nano
   Gold Catalysts in n-Octanol Oxidation
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB This study aims to identify the role of the various electronic states of gold in the catalytic behavior of Au/MxOy/TiO2 (where MxOy are Fe2O3 or MgO) for the liquid phase oxidation of n-octanol, under mild conditions. For this purpose, Au/MxOy/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by deposition-precipitation with urea, varying the gold content (0.5 or 4 wt.%) and pretreatment conditions (H-2 or O-2), and characterized by low temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), scanning transmission electron microscopy-high angle annular dark field (STEM HAADF), diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy of CO adsorption, temperature-programmable desorption (TPD) of ammonia and carbon dioxide, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Three states of gold were identified on the surface of the catalysts, Au-0, Au1+ and Au3+, and their ratio determined the catalysts performance. Based on a comparison of catalytic and spectroscopic results, it may be concluded that Au+ was the active site state, while Au-0 had negative effect, due to a partial blocking of Au-0 by solvent. Au3+ also inhibited the oxidation process, due to the strong adsorption of the solvent and/or water formed during the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations confirmed these suggestions. The dependence of selectivity on the ratio of BrOnsted acid centers to BrOnsted basic centers was revealed.

TI Nitrogen-doped mixed-phase TiO2 with controllable phase
   junction as superior visible-light photocatalyst for selective oxidation
   of cyclohexane
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Nitrogen-doped anatase/rutile mixed-phase TiO2 photocatalysts with carbonaceous species were successfully fabricated by pyrolyzing MIL-125 (Ti) and P25 composite as the precursor, and subsequently doping nitrogen into the pyrolysis product using urea as the dopant in a sealed reactor. Through varying the addition amount of P25 in the precursor, the ratios of anatase/rutile phases in the photocatalysts were conveniently adjusted. The photocatalysts showed excellent photocatalytic cyclohexane oxidation performances under visible light irradiation. The yield of the KA oil (cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) reached 112.44 mu mol after 5 h illumination for the photocatalyst with the optimal anatase/rutile ratio (N-TiO2-3), which was 5.66 and 39.87 times that of N-TiO2-0 (nitrogen-doped anatase TiO2) and N-P25 (nitrogen-doped P25), respectively. In the meantime, the selectivity toward cyclohexanone could reach 100%. The influences of pyrolysis temperature and atmosphere on the microstructure of catalysts and resulting catalytic performances for cyclohexane oxidation were also investigated. The improved photocatalytic properties were attributed to the combined effects of the high visible-light absorption caused by nitrogen doping, valid separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs derived from the mixed-phase junction, unique auxiliary function of carbonaceous species and porous structure. A possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed according to the active species determined by trapping experiments.

TI Controlled synthesis of M doped NiVS (M = Co, Ce and Cr) as a robust
   electrocatalyst for urea electrolysis
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Urea electrolysis can be used to treat wastewater containing urea and alleviate the energy crisis, so it is one of the best ways to solve environmental and energy problems. This paper reports the synthesis of M doped NiVS (M = Co, Ce and Cr) composites by a simple hydrothermal process for the first time. What is noteworthy is that the Ce-NiVS material as a catalytic electrode requires only 141 mV overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 1.291 V potential for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea mixed alkaline solution. Using Ce-NiVS/NF as both the anode and cathode for urea electrolysis, a current density of 10 mA cm-2 is driven by a voltage of only 1.55 V, which is better than most previous catalysts. Experimental results demonstrate that the excellent catalytic activity of Ce-NiVS materials is due to the formation of a large number of active sites and the improvement of conductivity due to doping with Ce. Density functional theory calculation shows that the VS4 material has a small Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption, which plays a major role in the hydrogen production process, and Ce-NiS has a higher density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, indicating that Ce-NiS has better electronic conductivity. The synergistic catalysis of VS4 and Ce-NiS promoted the hydrogen production performance of the Ce-NiVS material. This work provides guidance for the optimization and design of low-cost electrocatalysts to replace expensive precious metal-based electrocatalysts for overall urea electrolysis.
   Ce-NiVS as a catalytic electrode requires only 141 mV overpotential for HER and 1.291 V potential for UOR at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea mixed alkaline solution.

TI Thin-felt microfibrous-structured
   Au-α-Fe2O3/ns-γ-Al2O3/Al-fib
   er catalyst for high-throughput CO oxidation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Gold nanoparticles supported on Fe2O3 are a promising type of catalyst for CO oxidation. One challenge for their application in the real world is developing novel monolithic catalytic packings to meet the fundamental criteria (for example, high catalyst utilization efficiency and low pressure drop) needed for such high-throughput reaction process. Herein, a highly active and efficient thin-felt microfibrous-structured Au-alpha-Fe2O3/ns-gamma-Al2O3/Al-fiber catalyst with unique form factor and high permeability is fabricated for the low-temperature CO oxidation. Initially, thin-felt Al-fiber felt (60 gm diameter; 85 vol% voidage) undergoes a steam-only oxidation and calcination to create a 0.7 mu m mesoporous layer of gamma-Al2O3 nanosheets (ns-gamma-Al2O3) along with the Al-fiber. Subsequently, alpha-Fe2O3 is hydrothermally grown onto the ns-gamma-Al2O3 layer followed by Au nanoparticle deposition via urea-assistant deposition-precipitation method. As-resulted microfibrous-structured Au-alpha-Fe2O3/ns-gamma-Al2O3/Al-fiber catalysts effectively and efficiently couple the low-temperature activity and improved water vapor tolerance with enhanced catalyst accessibility and high permeability. The promising microfibrous-structured catalyst with only 0.14 wt% Au and 1.4 wt% alpha-Fe2O3 is capable of fully or 40% oxidizing CO into CO2 at 25 degrees C or 0 degrees C for a feed gas of 2 vol% CO and 0.3 vol% water vapor in air at a high linear velocity of 0.7 cm s(-1) using a high gas hourly space velocity of 25,200 mL g-1 cat h(-1). Moreover, the microfibrous-structured catalyst performs robustly for at least 232 h under the changeable temperature conditions. Interestingly, 3D hierarchical porous flake structure of alpha-Fe2O3 nano-sheets is detected other than the irregular micron-sized particles, leading to a 3-fold increase in the intrinsic activity (TOF of 0.46 s(-1) for the Au-alpha-Fe2O3/ns-gamma-Al2O3/Al-fiber vs. 0.11 s(-1) for the Au-alpha-Fe2O3 powder at 25 degrees C).

TI The synthesis of CoS/MnCo2O4-MnO2
   nanocomposites for supercapacitors and energy-saving H2
   production
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB In this study, CoS/MnCo2O4-MnO2 (CMM) nanocomposites were synthesized by hydrothermal and then electrochemical deposition. Their electrochemical properties were systematically investigated for supercapacitors and energy-saving H-2 production. As an electrode material for supercapacitor, CMM demonstrates a specific capacitance of 2320F g(-1) at 1 A/g, and maintains a specific capacitance of 1216F g(-1) at 10 A/g. It also shows 72.8 % capacitance retention after 8000 cycles. The aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited high energy storage capacity (887.86F g(-1) specific capacitance at a current density of 1 A/g), good rate performance and cycling stability. Besides, CMM shows outstanding urea oxidation reaction(UOR) and glycol oxidation reaction (MOR) performances for H-2 production. Compared to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (1.635 V) at 20 mA cm(-2), the potentials were reduced by 213 mV for UOR and 233 mV for MOR, respectively. Therefore, this study shows the promising practical applications of CMM nanocomposites for energy storage and energy-saving H-2 production. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Rapid soil rewetting promotes limited N2O emissions and
   suppresses NH3 volatilization under urea addition
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB The alternation of dry and wet is an important environmental factor affecting the emission of nitrous oxide from soil. However, the consistent or opposite effects on NH3 and N2O emissions caused by adding exogenous urea in this process have not been fully considered. Here, we controlled the initial (slow drying) and final (adding water) water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 70%, 60%, or 50% through microculture experiment to simulate a process of slow drying-fertilization and rapid wetting of the soil from rice harvest to dryland crop fertilization. Through measuring soil chemical properties and the abundance and composition of related microbial communities during drying process, we studied the pathways of influence of drying and rewetting on the emission of N2O and NH3 after urea application. During the progressive drying process (WFPS decreasing from 70% to 60% and 50%), soil N2O and NH3 emissions decreased by 49.77%-72.13% and 17.89%-42.19%, respectively. After rapid rewetting (WFPS increasing from 60% to 70%, 50%-60% and 70%), N2O emissions showed a slight increase, while NH3 volatilization continued to decrease. Soil NH+4 - N and DOC contents both decreased during progressive drying, while the soil NO-3 - N content was enhanced. The drying process changed the community structure of ureC and amoA-b and reduced their abundance but had no effect on amoA-a, nirK or nirS. Correlation analysis indicated that the reductions in NH+4 - N content and the abundances of ureC and amoA-b were the main factors suppressing N2O and NH3 emissions. We believe that drying process limits the related microbial activity and substrate supply during ammonia oxidation process in terms of N2O emissions, while in terms of NH3 volatilization, it reduces the related microbial activity of urea hydrolysis process and increases the ammonium adsorption to the soil.

TI Construction of self-supporting bimetallic sulfide arrays as a highly
   efficient electrocatalyst for bifunctional electro-oxidation
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Hydrogen production by water splitting is considered to be a feasible and energy-conserving way to develop renewable energy. Compared with water electrolysis which involves oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER), the introduction of urea not only improves the energy conversion efficiency of water electrolysis but also involves the urea-rich wastewater treatment. In this work, a promising and novel bifunctional electrocatalytic material, bimetal nickel-cobalt sulfide nanosheet arrays on Ni Foam (NCS/NF), is developed as an electrocatalyst for water splitting. Benefiting from the sulfuration effect, which facilitates the formation of the high-valence states of Ni and Co during the oxidation process, the NCS/NF demonstrates a low potential of 1.46 V for the OER and 1.31 V for the UOR at 10 mA cm(-2). When utilized in a water-splitting system with urea, the voltage is further reduced to 1.397 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The result lays the foundation for exploring the feasibility of low energy-intensive and large-scale hydrogen production in the future.

TI Active-chlorine-mediated oxidation of 5-fluorouracil on a hierarchically
   ordered macroporous RuO2 electrode
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB A hierarchically ordered macroporous RuO2 electrode (HOM-RuO2) was fabricated to enhance in situ active chlorine production in an electrochemical system intended for treatment of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs). The unique structure of HOM-RuO2 resulted in a decrease of the chlorine evolution potential, a large electro-active area available for in situ conversion of Cl to active chlorine, and hence improved the active chlorine production by 40%. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was used as a target pollutant to explore the performance of the HOM-RuO2 for PhACs degradation based on the in situ generated active chlorine. The results showed that the reaction rate of active-chlorine-mediated oxidation of 5-FU produced using the HOM-RuO2 was 18.4 times higher than that in the case of hydroxyl radicals (OH)-initiated oxidation using a PbO2 electrode at 30 mA cm-2. The effects of current density and initial solution pH on the 5-FU removal were investigated. The mechanism of 5-FU degradation was proposed taking into accounts both active chlorine production, and change of the speciation of 5-FU caused by pH variations. The dominant degradation products observed for the degradation of 5-FU using the HOM-RuO2 were lactic acid, propanol, acetic acid, urea and other small molecules, but no chlorinated products were detected. These study demonstrates the promise of the HOM-RuO2-based electrochemical systems for the active-chlorine-mediated treatment of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals found in wastewater.

TI Electrochemical properties of NiO-Ni electrocatalyst synthesized via
   solution combustion for methanol oxidation in alkaline media
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Transition metal oxides have been recently considered as the anode catalyst in direct methanol fuel cells to reduce the anodic overpotential of methanol electrooxidation in alkaline media. In this work, the NiO -Ni catalyst is synthesized via solution combustion synthesis process to reach an appropriate nanomorphology with high effective surface area and electrocatalytic activity. The influence of the fuel type (glycine and urea) and the fuel to oxidizer (F/O) ratio are investigated. The composition and phase analysis, crystallite size, particle size, specific surface area, and morphology of the nanoparticles are assessed. Moreover, electrochemical characteristics of the products are evaluated. The catalytic activity of the product towards methanol oxidation is found to vary with the fuel type and F/O ratio. The dependence of the oxidation current on the adiabatic temperature and morphological characteristics of the product is discussed. It is found that solution combustion synthesis is a confident technique that provides a considerable improvement in catalytic performance. Moreover, it is concluded that samples with dominant NiO show lower onset potential and higher current density. Synthesis by glycine in the most explosive condition (i.e., F/O = 0.83) results in more desirable catalytic activity.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Partial oxidation of methanol catalyzed with Au/TiO2,
   Au/ZrO2 and Au/ZrO2-TiO2 catalysts
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Mesoporous TiO2, ZrO2 and ZrO2-TiO2 mixed oxides were synthesized by the sol-gel method and the Au/TiO2, Au/ZrO2 and Au/ZrO2-TiO2 catalysts were prepared by deposition-precipitation method using urea solution as a precipitating agent. These materials were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ FTIR-pyridine (FTIR-Py) adsorption. XRD patterns of the samples confirmed the formation of ZrTiO4 phase in the ZrO2-TiO2 mixed oxides. TEM micrographs showed that nanosized gold particles on the catalyst had an average diameter smaller than 5 nm. Metallic gold (Au-0) and oxidized Au species (Au-n(delta+)) on the surface of the catalysts were evidenced by UV-vis and XPS characterization. In the partial oxidation of methanol (POM) reaction, among the six catalysts, the high metallic Au-0/Au+ ratio and low surface acidity in the Au/ZrO2 catalysts are chiefly responsible for the highest hydrogen production rate in the whole temperature range between 210 and 300 degrees C. Methanol decomposition as secondary reaction was favored on TiO2-based catalysts at higher temperature, producing a large amount of CO. Formation of ZrO2-TiO2 solid solution resulted in generation of both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites; as a result, dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol was allowed over Au/ZrO2-TiO2 catalysts.

   electrolyte
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Currently, Substituting methanol oxidation reaction with a low theoretical potential for water oxidation reaction is one of the hotspots in the study of water splitting to hydrogen production. In this work, N-C/NiO nanocomposites with different morphologies were synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal method. Interestingly, the tremella-like N-C/NiO nanocomposites turned into looser flower-like structure at the existence of N-C-SiO2 nanosheets supporting in the hydrothermal process. Meanwhile, the silica in the N-C-SiO2 nanosheets was removed by urea in hydrothermal reaction. The introduction of the N-C-SiO2 nanosheets has a vital influence to enhance the electrochemical performance of the N-C/NiO nanocomposites. The flower-like N-C/NiO nanocomposites exhibit large electrochemically active surface area and superior electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkalic electrolyte. It displays excellent electrocatalytic activity with a highly mass activity (3298 mA mg-1) and long-time stability (remain 50% after 36,000 s) toward MOR, which are 35.0 and 2.9 folds higher than that of the commercial 10%-Pt/C, respectively.

TI Construction of Co3S4/MoS2 p-p heterojunction as an efficient catalyst
   for water splitting and electrochemical oxidation of organic molecules
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Electrolysis of wastewater containing urea or small organic molecules while obtaining hydrogen energy is a promising strategy for realizing energy acquisition and environmental protection. Construction of semiconductor heterojunctions to regulate the transfer of interfacial electrons has been regarded as an efficient approach to improve the electrocatalytic performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for the materials, and obtain the bifunctional electrocatalysts aiming to construct a water splitting cell using one non-precious metal material. Herein, a bifunctional Co3S4/MoS2 electrocatalyst with a p-p heterojunction and hollow structure has been successfully prepared through the precipitation-hydrothermal method, which presents the high bifunctional electrocatalytic performance due to the formed path of electron transfer in the heterojunction interface being favorable for OH- adsorption. The accelerated electron transfer in heterojunction interfaces endows Co3S4/MoS2 presenting the superior electrocatalytic performance including OER, urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and oxygen evolution reaction in lactic acid solution (OER-LA). At 50 mA cm-2, the voltages of HER, OER, UOR and OER-LA are -0.123, 1.511, 1.400, 1.440 V vs. RHE, respectively. In a twoelectrode electrolytic cell using Co3S4/MoS2 as anode and cathode displays the outstanding electrocatalytic performance in 1 M KOH, 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea, and 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M lactic acid electrolytes, superior to the most reported materials. This research provides a strategy for the construction of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts using metal sulfides to form heterojunction for realizing the high bifunctional catalytic activities in hydrogen production and organic molecule decontamination.

TI A phosphorus modified mesoporous AuRh film as an efficient bifunctional
   electrocatalyst for urea-assisted energy-saving hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Hybrid water electrolysis composed of the anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been regarded as a green and sustainable technique for hydrogen production, and its efficiency highly depends on the identification of active electrocatalysts. Herein, a phosphorus modified mesoporous AuRh film grown on Ni foam (P-mAuRh film/NF) is synthesized via the combination of an in situ micelle assisted chemical displacement method and post phosphorization treatment process, and serves as a highly active and durable electrocatalyst for both the HER and UOR. Impressively, the self-supported P-mAuRh film/NF as both the anodic and cathodic catalyst can efficiently drive overall urea-assisted water electrolysis. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of P-mAuRh film/NF is attributed to the synergism of the mesoporous film nanoarchitecture and optimized bimetallic composition, as well as the electron interaction between metal and nonmetal. This research offers a universal route to synthesize bifunctional nonmetal-metal mesoporous films for energy-saving H-2 production via hybrid water electrolysis.

   viability assay
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Nano-size silver particles were stabilized on the inner surfaces of urea based periodic mesoporous organosilica (Ur-PMO). Aqueous extract of Euphorbia leaves as a sustainable and green reducing agent was applied for Ag-nanoparticles growth into the Ur-PMO channels. Physical and chemical properties of organosilica materials synthesized using various techniques such as FT-IR, small-angle XRD, PXRD, FESEM, TEM, SEM-EDX and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) were examined. Finally, the AgNPs/Ur-PMO were investigated on cell viability assay. An in vitro cytotoxicity test using MMT assay displayed that the designed material has good biocompatibility and could be a promising candidate for biomedical applications. The results also showed that the AgNPs/Ur-PMO compounds (especially, PMO; 1.27% AgNPs) had relatively good antibacterial and antibiofilm effects. It seems that the use of these compounds in hospital environments can reduce nosocomial infections as well as reduce antibiotic-resistant bacteria. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Kinetic Study on the Reduction of Room-Temperature NOx
    in Etching Waste Gas by Na2S2O5
   and Urea in Alkaline Pretreatment
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB Etching waste gases derived from photovoltaic cell production are difficult to treat at room temperature. Therefore, the use of wet denitrification with Na2S2O5 is recommended to overcome this issue. The presence of O-2, Cl-2, and metals in gases leads to the consumption of 65% of SO32- within 2 h. Although alkaline pretreatment adsorbs most of the gases and metals, the high ceiling temperature results in a short residence time and incomplete reaction with the lye. Therefore, in this study, urea was added to Na2S2O5. After adding the optimum concentration of urea (0.5 mol L-1) to a 1.0 mol L-1 SO32- solution, the anodic potential measured using cyclic voltammetry shifted from 0.051 to -0.119 V, the electron transfer rate k(0) decreased from 4.89 x 10(-5) to 4.27 x 10(-5) cm s(-1), the exchange current density measured using the polarization curve decreased from 18.37 to 13.58 A cm(-2), and the reaction activation energy increased from 37 to 63 kJ mol(-1). Therefore, adding urea to generate hydroxyl functional groups can effectively block the free radical oxidation chain reaction of SO32-, hindering its oxidization. In summary, alkaline pretreatment and urea addition can increase the effective reaction between SO32- and NOx and reduce the costs. Our study provides data to support the application of wet denitrification at room temperature.

TI Optimization of the microstructure of TiO2 photocatalytic
   surfaces created by Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation of titanium substrates
SO SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY
AB UV treatments are commonly employed for removal of pollutants from water in industrial environments. Introduction of a suitable photocatalyst can be beneficial in improving the energy efficiency. This commonly involves creating powerful reactive oxygen species that are able to degrade pollutants. However, the photocatalyst is required to have both high surface area (accessible to irradiation from the light source) and to be mechanically robust. TiO2 is a well-known photocatalyst, suitable for use under UV illumination. This paper concerns production of photocatalytic TiO2 via Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) of titanium substrates. PEO of Ti commonly results in highly porous TiO2 coatings that adhere strongly to a robust metallic substrate. Characteristics of the electrical discharges, which are central to the PEO process, have been studied using high-speed photography. These results are correlated with the microstructure of the resultant coating. The photocatalytic performance has been evaluated under UV-C illumination, using urea as a model pollutant, and modelling of liquid flow over the PEO surfaces has been performed using COMSOL. Photocatalytic activity is enhanced on samples with high surface roughness and high surface area, which tend to be produced after intermediate processing times (8 min). This is explained in terms of how fluid flow is disrupted over rough surfaces, reducing the thickness of the hydrodynamic boundary layer and increasing the interaction between pollutant and catalytic surface.

TI Built-in electric field induced interfacial charge distributions of
   Ni2P/NiSe2 heterojunction for urea-assisted
   hydrogen evolution reaction
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB The direct urea fuel cell (DUFC) with high energy efficiency and convenience is expected to have promising practical applications in green energy development, but it is severely hindered by the slow kinetics of the intrinsic urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, a built-in electric field (BEF) strategy to obtain efficient heterogeneous Ni2P/NiSe2 electrocatalysts as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the UOR is reported. XPS, energy band structure analysis and DFT calculations verify that the BEF in the heterojunction can induce electron transfer between Ni2P and NiSe2. More importantly, the BEF-induced interfacial charge distributions endow the Ni2P/NiSe2 heterogeneous electrocatalysts with optimized binding free energy of the H* and urea intermediates, thereby resulting in an intrinsic enhancement of the catalytic activity. Our work may explore a pathway to design efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts by precisely constructing and manipulating an interfacial BEF.

AB The preferential oxidation of CO (CO-PROX) under excess hydrogen over Au/MOx/Al2O3 (M = La, Ce, and Mg) catalysts was investigated. All catalysts were prepared by a deposition-precipitation method with urea and characterized with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, N-2 physisorption, temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of the supported gold catalysts was found to be dependent on the promoter, and decreased in the order: Au/La2O3/Al2O3 > Au/CeO2/Al2O3 > Au/MgO/Al2O3 > Au/Al2O3. The catalytic activity of the Au/La2O3/Al2O3 catalyst depended on the pretreatment conditions, i.e., reduction with aqueous NaBH4, thermal reduction with H-2, and calcination with O-2. This indicates that the oxidation state of gold is an important factor in the activity of the catalyst, and that metallic gold is more suitable than its oxidized form for this reaction. XPS results revealed that the treatment with aqueous NaBH4 resulted in more negative charge in gold particles than that of conventional thermal reduction under H-2. Smaller gold particles appeared to be favorable for the low-temperature CO-PROX activity of the Au/La2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, which showed stable CO-PROX performance, even in the presence of CO2.

TI Enhanced electrocatalytic activity of a layered triple hydroxide (LTH)
   by modulating the electronic structure and active sites for efficient
   and stable urea electrolysis
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB A clean and sustainable "hydrogen-based economy" will usher in a new era. Therefore, the hydrogen production pathway is crucial. The urea (CO(NH2)(2)) electrolysis has recently been investigated as a promising energy-saving approach for renewable hydrogen production compared to conventional water (H2O) electrolysis. This is because of the minimal cell voltage, mitigation of urea-rich wastewater, and availability of electrocatalysts. Herein, we report trimetallic nickel-cobalt-iron layered triple hydroxide nanosheets (NiCoFe-LTH) grown on nickel foam (NF) via a one-step hydrothermal synthesis method. They were tested as catalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs). NiCoFe-LTH/NF behaves as a highly active durable 2D catalyst electrode for the UOR and HER with the required potentials of 1.337 V and 180 mV to achieve catalytic current densities of 25 and 10 mA cm(-2) respectively, in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. Moreover, this electrode also performs well in urea-electrolysis, requiring a very small potential of 1.49 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) over a period of 30 h. The developed urea electrolyzer is very effective at producing H-2. It is cost-effective and involves no difficulties in material synthesis or electrolyzer fabrication, paving the way for the development of clean renewable energy infrastructure.

TI Controllable synthesis for carbon self-doping and structural defect co-
   modified g-C3N4: Enhanced photocatalytic oxidation performance and the
   mechanism insight
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB For the purpose of improving the photocatalytic performance of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) in the field of contaminant elimination, an in-situ malonamide-assisted strategy is provided to prepare carbon self-doping and structural defect co-modified g-C3N4 (CDCN) via preprocessing of the mixture of urea and malonamide followed by thermal copolymerization. Changing the initial malonamide dosage can precisely adjust the carbon doping level and structural defect concentration of CDCN. The characteristic results confirm that the doped C derived from malonamide was successfully implanted into the g-C3N4 framework by replacing sp2 hybrid N atoms (C-N=C) in the heptazine units, simultaneously forming some structural defects. Additionally, the preprocessing endows CDCN with good textural properties. So, the optimal CDCN20 shows remarkably enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity in eliminating acetaminophen (APAP) and methylparaben (MPB) in water than pristine g-C3N4. By combining experimental and theoretical calculating results, the synergistic effect of C self-doping and structural defect promoting the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 is revealed thoroughly. This work provides a controllable strategy for synthesizing effective C self-doped g-C3N4 and a new insight into electronic structure and band structure-regulated photocatalytic oxidation mechanisms.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Effect of the loading content of CuO on the activity and structure of
   CuO/Ce-Mn-O catalysts for CO oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF RARE EARTHS
AB A urea-nitrate combustion method was used to prepare Ce-Mn-O material, which was applied as the support for a series of CuO/Ce-Mn-O catalysts. The structure of the catalysts was characterized with N-2 adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalytic activity of the catalysts for the oxidation of CO was evaluated on a conventional fixed-bed quartz reactor. XRD results showed that the synergetic effect between manganese and cerium led to a little higher electron density of Ce3+ in the mixed oxides. When the CuO content was lower than 5 wt.%, Cu species were well dispersed onto the Ce-Mn-O support or/and they formed a solid solution with CeO2 (inside the fluorite lattice). At higher CuO content (CuO>5 wt.%), large CuO particles were observed. There was strong interaction among ceria, manganese and copper oxide because of the doping of Mn. This interplay changed the reducibility and the valence states of the components, leading to the improved activity of the CuO/Ce-Mn-O catalysts.

TI Nitrite accumulation and nitrogen gas production increase with
   decreasing temperature in urea-amended soils: Experiments and modeling
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Nitrite (NO2-) accumulation and associated production of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases in soils amended with nitrogen (N) fertilizers are well documented, but there remains a poor understanding of their regulation and variation among soil types. We examined responses to urea inputs in two soils at five temperatures from 5 to 30 degrees C and developed a process-driven model to describe the dynamics. A microcosm system was used to measure ammonia gas (NH3), ammonium (NH4+), NO2-, nitrate (NO3-), NO, N2O and pH over 12 weeks. Unexpectedly, NO2-, NO and N2O production tended to increase as soil temperature declined in both soils. The maximum NO2- concentration, or compensation point (CP), differed by soil type but the time required to reach CP decreased exponentially with increasing temperature in both soils. A two-step nitrification model ('2SN') accounted for interactions of ammonia-oxidation (AmO), nitrite oxidation (NiO), urea hydrolysis, NH4- sorption, N gas production and pH dynamics. Both steps of nitrification (AmO and NiO) were modeled using NH3 inhibition kinetics. The model adequately simulated the observed dynamics and temperature responses and showed that increased uncoupling of AmO and NiO at colder temperatures resulted from their differential temperature responses. The dynamics observed here may be important following high-rate and banded N fertilizer applications and in ruminant urine patches. The results may help explain elevated N2O emissions observed under cold temperatures. The 2SN model can account for interactions among multiple processes and may be useful for studying the effects of management practices and climate factors, including climate change scenarios, on soil N cycling.

TI Solvent-free selective oxidation of alcohols with tert-butyl
   hydroperoxide catalyzed by dioxo-molybdenum (VI) unsymmetrical Schiff
   base complex immobilized on
   CoFe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles
SO RESEARCH ON CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES
AB In the present paper, the catalytic activity of a dioxo-molybdenum (VI) unsymmetrical Schiff base complex immobilized on CoFe2O4@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles (CoFe2O4@SiO2@[MoO2(salenac-OH)] where salenac-OH = [9-(2',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,8-diaza-4-methylnona-2,4,8-trienato](-2)) was studied in the selective oxidation of alcohols using tert-BuOOH (TBHP, 70% aqueous solution) as an oxidant. In this catalytic system, the contribution of different solvents was investigated, and it was found that the various primary and secondary alcohols were oxidized to their equivalent aldehydes and ketones with good to excellent yields (64-97%) at ambient temperature under solvent-free conditions. Moreover, the effect of other essential factors such as the type of oxidant and the quantity of catalyst on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was explored. Among different oxidants such as H2O2, urea/H2O2 (UHP), tert-BuOOH (TBHP) and NaIO4, tert-BuOOH was selected as oxygen donor, and the oxidation of benzyl alcohol required 50 mg (0.0135 mmol Mo) of catalyst to complete. The CoFe2O4@SiO2@[MoO2(salenac-OH)] catalyst can be conveniently removed from the reaction mixture by using an external magnet and reused four times without notable loss of its catalytic performance. Besides, comparing the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the recycled catalyst with fresh catalyst showed no significant difference, proving that the catalyst structure remained intact after recovery.

TI A Structure-function Analysis of Hepatocyte Arginase 2 Reveals
   Mitochondrial Ureahydrolysis as a Determinant of Glucose Oxidation
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Restoring hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity is critical to prevent or reverse metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Glucose homeostasis comprises in part the complex regulation of hepatic glucose production and insulin -mediated glucose uptake and oxidation in peripheral tissues. We previously identi fi ed hepatocyte arginase 2 (Arg2) as an inducible ureahydrolase that improves glucose homeostasis and enhances glucose oxidation in multiple obese, insulin -resistant models. We therefore examined structure -function determinants through which hepatocyte Arg2 governs systemic insulin action and glucose oxidation. METHODS: To do this, we generated mice expressing wildtype murine Arg2, enzymatically inactive Arg2 (Arg2 H160F ) and Arg2 lacking its putative mitochondrial targeting sequence (Arg2 degrees 1-22 ). We expressed these hepatocyte-speci fi c constructs in obese, diabetic ( db/db ) mice and performed genetic complementation analyses in hepatocyte-speci fi c Arg2-de fi cent (Arg2 LKO ) mice. RESULTS: We show that Arg2 attenuates hepatic steatosis, independent of mitochondrial localization or ureahydrolase activity, and that enzymatic arginase activity is dispensable for Arg2 to augment total body energy expenditure. In contrast, mitochondrial localization and ureahydrolase activity were required for Arg2-mediated reductions in fasting glucose and insulin resistance indices. Mechanistically, Arg2 degrees 1-22 and Arg2 H160F failed to suppress glucose appearance during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamping. Quanti fi cation of heavy -isotope -labeled glucose oxidation further revealed that mistargeting or ablating Arg2 enzymatic function abrogates Arg2-induced peripheral glucose oxidation. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the metabolic effects of Arg2 extend beyond its enzymatic activity, yet hepatocyte mitochondrial ureahydrolysis drives hepatic and peripheral oxidative metabolism. The data de fi ne a structure -based mechanism mediating hepatocyte Arg2 function and nominate hepatocyte mitochondrial ureahydrolysis as a key determinant of glucose oxidative capacity in mammals.

TI Highly Efficient and Stable Saline Water Electrolysis Enabled by
   Self-Supported Nickel-Iron Phosphosulfide Nanotubes With
   Heterointerfaces and Under-Coordinated Metal Active Sites
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Direct seawater electrolysis is proposed as a potential low-cost approach to green hydrogen production, taking advantage of the vastly available seawater and large-scale offshore renewable energy being deployed. However, developing efficient, earth-abundant electrocatalysts that can survive under harsh corrosive conditions for a long time is still a significant technical challenge. Herein, the fabrication of a self-supported nickel-iron phosphosulfide (NiFeSP) nanotube array electrode through a two-step sulfurization/phosphorization approach is reported. The as-obtained NiFeSP nanotubes comprise abundant NiFeS/NiFeP heterointerfaces and under-coordinated metal sites, exhibiting outstanding activity and durability for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in simulated alkaline-seawater solution (KOH + NaCl), with an overpotential of 380 (HER) and 260 mV (OER) at 500 mA cm(-2) and outstanding durability of 1000 h. Theoretical calculations support the observed outstanding performance, showing that the heterointerface and under-coordinated metal sites synergistically lower the energy barrier of the rate-determining step reactions. The NiFeSP electrode also shows good catalytic performance for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). By coupling UOR with HER, the bifunctional NiFeSP electrode pair can efficiently catalyze the overall urea-mediated alkaline-saline water electrolysis at 500 mA cm(-2) under 1.938 V for 1000 h without notable performance degradation.

TI Porous PdRh nanobowls: facile synthesis and activity for alkaline
   ethanol oxidation
SO NANOSCALE
AB Optimizing structure and composition with respect to electrocatalytic performance is critical to achieve outstanding Pd-based electrocatalysts. Herein, we have successfully developed a novel electrocatalyst of hollow and porous PdRh nanobowls (PdRh NBs) for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) by using urea as a guiding surfactant. Under alkaline hydrothermal conditions, urea molecules can release bubbles (NH3 and CO2) that in turn guide the formation of PdRh nanobowls. The porous bowl-like structures of PdRh NBs expose abundant surface sites, which allows for increased collision frequency via confining reactants within open spaces. In regards to composition, the reason for introducing Rh is that not only is the redox potential of Rh approximate with that of Pd (beneficial to the formation of high PdRh alloy phase), but also it can effectively facilitate the breakage of C-C bond on the electrode surface (enhancing the total oxidation of ethanol to CO2). Benefiting from the compositional and structural advantages, the newly developed PdRh NBs exhibit significantly improved electrocatalytic activity for the EOR compared with those of the pure Pd NBs, PdRh nanoparticles (PdRh NPs) and commercial Pd black. These attributes might make them good anodic candidates for application in direct ethanol fuel cells.

TI Effect of sol-gel conditions on BET surface area, pore volume, mean pore
   radius, palladium dispersion, palladium particle size, and catalytic CO
   oxidation activity of Pd/Al2O3 cryogels
SO JOURNAL OF POROUS MATERIALS
AB Porous and homogeneous palladium-alumina cryogels were synthesized from aluminium sec-butoxide (ASB) and palladium nitrate through one-pot sol-gel processing in an aqueous system and subsequent freeze drying. In order to optimize the sol-gel conditions so that higher catalytic oxidation activity could be acquired after high temperatures heating, effects of H2O/ASB, HNO3/ASB, ethylenediamine/Pd, and urea/ASB ratios on BET surface area, pore volume, mean pore radius, Pd dispersion, Pd diameter, and catalytic CO oxidation activity of the Pd/Al2O3 cryogels were examined. It was revealed that optimized molar ratios were ASB:H2O:HNO3:urea = 1:76:0.26:0.29 and ethylenediamine:Pd = 3.4:1, at the ratios of which higher Pd dispersion and more superior catalytic activity were obtained. It was suggested that maintenance of as large BET surface area and pore volume as possible even after the heating was important to obtain high Pd dispersion, which consequently brought about superior catalytic activity. It was also suggested that porosity of the cryogel also played an important role in suppressing the sintering of palladium. The palladium-alumina cryogel prepared under the optimized sol-gel conditions was compared with corresponding commercial catalyst in regard to Pd particle size, Pd dispersion, PdO reducibility, catalytic CO oxidation activity. It was shown, after heating the cryogel at 800 A degrees C for 5 h, that finer palladium particles with ca. 3.5 nm diameter were dispersed throughout alumina support with higher dispersion (ca. 32%), which was primarily responsible for higher catalytic oxidation activity on the cryogel.

TI Electro-oxidation of urine and constituent analysis of resulting
   wastewater and generated gases for water recovery in space
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
AB Electro-oxidation is a promising technology to recover water from urine for space applications. The process generates oxidants such as reactive oxygen species and chlorine containing species that prevent microbial growth in the plumbing and decrease total organic carbon (TOC), chloride, and ammonia while waste heat generated from the electrochemical process facilitates evaporation of water to be recovered elsewhere. Resulting wastewater and generated gas constituents could be useful for recycling, further closing the environmental loop, and reducing trash/waste volume. In order to investigate the wastewater and generated gas constituents comprehensively, a full-scale urine processor for four crewmembers was built. Raw human urine (8.4 L) was circulated and processed by a flow-through oxidation cell (anode: boron-doped diamond on Niobium, cathode: Tungsten). The average water evaporation rate was 2.0 g/min. The 30-A current decreased TOC, chloride, and ammonia essentially to zero in the urine wastewater within 532, 622, and 373 A h, respectively. Total nitrogen (TN) was decreased from 5695 mg/L to 725 mg/L within 400 A h. Most of the remaining nitrogen was nitrate. Approximately 2.6 g of chlorine/chlorine dioxide, 0.85 g of ozone, 46.5 g of carbon dioxide, 15 g of hydrogen, and 0.1 g of ammonia gases were generated from 8.4 L of urine. The test demonstrated water evaporation for water recovery and identified useful gases to be recycled in an environmental control and life support system for space applications.

TI Nitrogen-doped graphene supporting PtSn nanoparticles with a tunable
   microstructure to enhance the activity and stability for ethanol
   oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB In this work, a series of nitrogen-doped graphenes (NGs) were prepared by deriving from pyrolysis of graphite oxide (GO) with urea at different temperatures and high-dispersed PtSn nanoparticles with tunable size were then deposited onto nitrogen-doped graphene (PtSn/NG) by an easy-controlled template-free method. The PtSn/NG and undoped graphene (PtSn/G) were carried out as anode catalysts for the electrooxidation of ethanol. The microstructure and morphology of the synthesized catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic performance toward ethanol oxidation was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. It is found that the pyrolysis temperature is an important factor which influenced the contents of nitrogen and functional groups of nitrogen. And then, the functional groups of nitrogen affect the distribution, size, and contents of PtSn nanoparticles. The as-obtained optimal PtSn/NG-600 sample with narrower size distribution and high content of PtSn exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity and stability compared with the other samples, implying the potential application for ethanol fuel cells.

TI Mesoporous Ceria and Ceria-Praseodymia as High Surface Area Supports for
   Pd-based Catalysts with Enhanced Methane Oxidation Activity
SO CHEMCATCHEM
AB In recent years, Pd/CeO2 materials have proven to be effective catalysts for the total oxidation of methane. In this work, three different synthesis routes were used to prepare high specific surface area supports, consisting of pure CeO2 and 10 at% Pr-doped ceria (Ce90Pr10). Nano-structured spheres were obtained with a microwave-assisted synthesis, dumbbell-like particles were produced through a urea-based hydrothermal method, and ordered mesoporous oxides were prepared by using SBA-15 as hard-template. The six materials were then impregnated with 2 wt% Pd, calcined at 500 degrees C, and comprehensively characterized. All the samples retained their high surface area after impregnation (75-110 m2 g-1), allowing a good dispersion of palladium. No significant structural or morphological differences were observed upon Pr doping, but a higher Pd oxidation state was induced by Pr-doped supports. However, all Pd/CeO2 and Pd/Ce90Pr10 catalysts exhibited similar activity for dry methane oxidation below 500 degrees C, regardless of the synthesis technique and of the Pr presence: they all achieved almost complete CH4 oxidation at 400 degrees C, showing a really remarkable improvement with respect to analogous low surface area supports. A promoting role of Pr was instead noticed in wet conditions, thanks to its ability to counteract water-induced deactivation phenomena.
   High-surface-area materials consisting of pure and Pr-doped ceria were synthesized with different procedures and employed as supports for Pd-based catalysts. Thanks to their peculiar textural properties and better Pd dispersion, these mixed oxides exhibited remarkably higher activity towards methane oxidation with respect to analogous samples with low surface area. Pr-doping resulted particularly beneficial in wet conditions, reducing water-induced deactivation effects.image

TI PtxAg100-x nano-alloy decorated
   N-doped reduced graphene oxide: a promising electrocatalyst for direct
   urea fuel cells
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) offer an environmentally friendly, and cost-effective way to turn wastewater into energy. However, the paucity of efficient, cost-effective, and electrochemically stable urea electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) specific electrocatalysts continues to impede the design and development of practically useful DUFCs. The present work explores the design and development of N-doped graphene (NGr)-supported platinum (Pt) plus silver (Ag) alloy nanohybrids (PtxAg100-x-NGr) as potential UOR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that the electrocatalytic performance of PtxAg100-x-NGr is very sensitive toward the composition of this nanohybrid. The nanohybrid with a Pt : Ag ratio of 1 : 1, referred to as Pt50Ag50-NGr in the MS, exhibits the best UOR electrocatalytic performance. The Pt50Ag50-NGr composite exhibits a Tafel slope of just similar to 12.92 mV dec(-1), and a UOR-specific activity of nearly 4028 mA cm(-2) mg cat(-1) at 1.673 V (vs. RHE) and requires an overpotential of just 1.617 V (vs. RHE) to maintain a UOR specific current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These parameters qualify the Pt50Ag50-NGr as a promising anode material for DUFCs. This we demonstrate through the design of a Pt50Ag50-NGr anode-based prototype urea-H2O2 fuel cell that delivers an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 750 mV and a power density of similar to 5.75 mW cm(-2).

TI Inhibition mechanism of spontaneous combustion by nano-sized complex
   inhibitor for Chinese lignite in low-temperature oxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING COMMUNICATIONS
AB In order to analyze the inhibition mechanism of inhibitor in the process of low-temperature oxidation, nanometer aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)(3)], nano-sized magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)(2)], and mixtures of Al(OH)(3) and Mg(OH)(2) were investigated as inhibitor. The low-temperature oxidation process of blended inhibitor and lignite was analyzed using automatic heating system and oxidation of O-2-TG. Our results showed that Al(OH)(3) effectively delayed the water evaporation process of coal samples in the early stage of low-temperature oxidation. No strong increases of oxygen and weight had been observed in the stage of increasing oxygen gain when both Al(OH)(3) and Mg(OH)(2) were used as inhibitor. Content change of active groups such as hydroxyl group, carbonyl group, carboxyl group and ether oxygen group of samples in the process of low-temperature oxidation were quantified by both FTIR and XPS. And our results shed light on the inhibition mechanism of spontaneous combustion by inhibitors for Chinese lignite exist in low-temperature oxidation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the performance of multi-component inhibitor is better than that of the single component inhibitor in low-temperature oxidation. Al(OH)(3) and Mg(OH)(2) prohibit the oxidation in the low-temperature region and high-temperature region, respectively. Therefore, the complex inhibitor can effectively decrease the low-temperature oxidation of coal, and can effectively prevent spontaneous combustion of coal.

TI Highly Reliable Label-Free Detection of Urea/Glucose and Sensing
   Mechanism Using SiO2 and CdSe-ZnS Nanoparticles in
   Electrolyte-Insulator-Semiconductor Structure
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB A simple, label-free and cost effective sensor have been studied for reliable urea/glucose sensing, and common serum analyte detection comparable with market available urea "Assay Kit" is also performed by using SiO2 and CdSe-ZnS nanoparticles in electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor structure for the first time. Thermally grown SiO2 membrane has shown lower pH detection limit (0.081) and lowest drift rate (2.9 mV/hr) than those of the sputtering and E-beam deposited SiO2 membranes. The urea detection at physiological buffer pH 7.4 with sensitivity of similar to 1.6 mV/mg. dl(-1) at linear range of 6 to 36 mg/dl is shown. The pH detection limit is further reduced (0.074) by using chaperonin protein mediated CdSe-ZnS nanoparticles assembly over SiO2 surface owing to high pH sensitivity of 55 mV/pH. The sensing mechanism is due to the SiOx content decreased with increasing pH value. This suggests the lower H+ ions absorption on the sensing membrane surface, which is observed by X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy. The glucose concentration is detected by using the core-shell CdSe-ZnS nanoparticles through H2O2 sensing because of reduction/oxidation (redox) properties of Zn as well as Zn2+ ions generation. Due to the high catalytic activity for H2O2 sensitivity, low detection limit of 1 mu M is obtained, which will help to detect glucose using this bio-chip in future. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

TI Influence of the preparation method and silver content on the nature of
   active sites in Ag/CeO2 catalysts used for propylene
   oxidation
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Silver supported on ceria solids (1 and 4 wt% Ag) are prepared by three different methods: Impregnation-Reduction with Citrate (IRC), Deposition-Precipitation with Urea (DPU), and Wetness Impregnation (WI). The catalysts are tested in the total oxidation of propylene. Presence of Ag2+ with Ag+ improves the catalytic activity. The solid prepared by the (IRC) method with a silver loading of 4 wt%, shows a better catalytic activity compared to the other solids. H-2-Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) techniques confirm that the presence of three different redox couples: Ag2+/Ag+, Ag-2+/Ag-0, and Ag+/Ag-0 in the (IRC) solid containing 4 wt% of silver is responsible for its superior catalytic performance.

TI Effect of Cu additives on the performance of a cobalt substituted ceria
   (Ce0.90Co0.1O02-δ) catalyst in total
   and preferential CO oxidation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB The study reports the modification of the developed Ce0.90Co0.10O2-delta catalyst by incorporating copper ions in order to improve the catalytic activity for total and preferential CO oxidation (TOX and PROX). A series of metal ion substituted ceria catalysts, Ce0.90Co0.10O2-delta and Ce0.90-xCuxCo0.10O2-delta (x=0.01, 0.03 and 0.05) were synthesized in a single step by the urea-assisted solution combustion method. The compositions, textural and structural properties of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, Raman, H-2-TPR and ICP-OES. The insertion of Cu ions in Ce0.90Co0.10O2-delta greatly enhanced the reducibility and improved the activity, with especially the Ce0.85Cu0.05Co0.10O2-delta catalyst showing superior catalytic performance compared to other bimetallic catalysts. Analysis of the reaction profiles and rate calculations suggest that H-2 and CO oxidation over Ce0.90Co0.10O2-delta may be occurring on the same active sites, while the two reactions appear to be taking place on independent sites over the Cu-containing catalysts. In addition, the effect of H2O/CO2 in PROX has been studied. The degree of deactivation by H2O and CO2 decreased with increasing the Cu content in the catalysts. The presented catalysts are highly active, selective and stable in TOX and PROX. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Efficient bifunctional catalysts synthesized from three-dimensional
   Ni/Fe bimetallic organic frameworks for overall urea electrolysis
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) Ni/Fe bimetallic organic framework (MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe) with a structure of rhombus blocks on nanosheets is synthesized on Ni foam by a 2-step solvothermal method. After sulfide reaction, MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S is vulcanized by MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe with a structure of interwoven and folding nanosheets. Meanwhile, Ni3S2 is formed under the influence of iron. This special structure makes MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S to expose more active sites. MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S shows superior urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. When MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S is used as UOR and HER catalysts, it has low potentials of 1.347 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) and 0.145 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, respectively. MOF-Ni@MOF-Fe-S as a bifunctional electrode is assembled as an alkaline urea electrolyzer, showing catalytic activity at a low cell voltage of 1.539 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability during 10 h chronopotentiometry analysis.

TI Controlled synthesis of ACo2O4 (A = Fe, Cu, Zn,
   Ni) as an environmentally friendly electrocatalyst for urea electrolysis
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Water electrolysis is relatively an environmentally friendly hydrogen production technology, but due to the slow transfer of four electrons in the anodic oxidation reaction, it needs a theoretical voltage of up to 1.23 V. Therefore, in this experiment, a series of transition metal oxides, ACo(2)O(4) (A = Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni), was synthesized on Ni foam current collectors by a hydrothermal and calcination method, and the material was applied in urea electrolysis to produce hydrogen. What is noteworthy is that the CuCo2O4 electrode has a unique flower-like nanoneedle structure, and has a larger electrochemical active area, more reactive active sites, and a faster charge transfer rate. In 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea solution, CuCo2O4 provides a potential of only 1.268 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) during the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), while in 1.0 M KOH solution, with the same current density, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is required to provide a potential of 1.53 V, indicating that the UOR can effectively replace the OER. Density functional theory calculations show that the CuCo2O4 material exhibits Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen closest to zero, thus promoting the electrochemistry performance of the electrode. In a cell composed of CuCo2O4//CuCo2O4, the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved by providing a potential of only 1.509 V. This work offers a novel scheme for reducing energy consumption of the OER and improving catalytic performance of the UOR.

TI Experimental Study on the NOx Removal by Scrubbing
   with Urea-H2O2 Solution after NO Partial
   Preoxidation
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB The NOx removal by scrubbing with urea-H2O2 solution after NO partial preoxidation was investigated in detail by experiments in a spray empty absorption tower. Various operating parameters including the liquid-gas ratio, residence time, degree of NO oxidation, H2O2 concentration, organo-additive concentration, absorbent solution temperature, and PH value were tested to investigate their influences. Results indicate that the NOx removal efficiency increases with increasing of the temperature and PH value of the absorbent solution. The addition of H2O2 can effectively enhance the absorption of NO, and the denitrification efficiency increases obviously when the organo-additive is used. It is relatively cost effective to control NO oxidation degree at 50% because NOx can be effectively absorbed via the reaction process: NO + NO2 + H2O -> 2HNO(2). The NOx removal efficiency increases linearly with increasing of the residence time and is little affected by the liquid-gas ratio. Under the optimal test conditions, more than 75% denitrification efficiency has been achieved. The proposed denitrification method is relatively low-cost and promising.

TI Electrocatalytic evaluation of β-SnWO4/rGO nanostructure for
   low-level urea detection
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB Urea is one of the most important and widely exploited nitrogenous organic compounds in the agriculture and its availability can also be exercised in the human body. Urea is an important entity that plays certain crucial roles in human body e.g., it works as carrier of waste nitrogen and has major contribution in countercurrent exchange system. Moreover, high concentration of urea can lead toward several health concerns such as kidney failure, urinary tract obstruction, dehydration, renal failure, cachexia, nephritic syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic failure, and shock burns. To quantify the urea concentration in human body through urine, a new and highly sensitive electrochemical sensor based on beta-SnWO4/rGO/GCE has been engineered. The electrocatalytic characteristics of proposed sensor were evaluated by exploiting different modes of voltammetry e.g., electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel plot and cyclic voltammetry (CV). For effective and sensitive determination of urea, different parameters were optimized as scan rate 110 mV/s, BRB electrolyte pH 2, and potential window from - 0.5 to 0.7 V. The LOD and LOQ of the developed sensor for urea were observed as 0.00016 and 0.0005 mu M, respectively. The real application of engineered sensor was tested in human urine samples. The recovery values of urine samples were found in acceptable range which prove the sensitivity and reliability of beta-SnWO4/rGO/GCE.

TI Amino acids downregulate SIRT4 to detoxify ammonia through the urea
   cycle
SO NATURE METABOLISM
AB Ammonia production via glutamate dehydrogenase is inhibited by SIRT4, a sirtuin that displays both amidase and non-amidase activities. The processes underlying the regulation of ammonia removal by amino acids remain unclear. Here, we report that SIRT4 acts as a decarbamylase that responds to amino acid sufficiency and regulates ammonia removal. Amino acids promote lysine 307 carbamylation (OTCCP-K307) of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), which activates OTC and the urea cycle. Proteomic and interactome screening identified OTC as a substrate of SIRT4. SIRT4 decarbamylates OTCCP-K307 and inactivates OTC in an NAD(+)-dependent manner. SIRT4 expression was transcriptionally upregulated by the amino acid insufficiency-activated GCN2-eIF2 alpha-ATF4 axis. SIRT4 knockout in cultured cells caused higher OTCCP-K307 levels, activated OTC, elevated urea cycle intermediates and urea production via amino acid catabolism. Sirt4 ablation decreased male mouse blood ammonia levels and ameliorated CCl4-induced hepatic encephalopathy phenotypes. We reveal that SIRT4 safeguards cellular ammonia toxicity during amino acid catabolism.
   In this study, Hu et al. identify a new mechanism through which sirtuin-4 fine-tunes urea cycle flux through decarbamylation of ornithine transcarbamylase to ensure proper ammonia detoxification upon increased amino acid catabolism.

TI Hydrated-Metal-Halide-Based Deep-Eutectic-Solvent-Mediated NiFe Layered
   Double Hydroxide: An Excellent Electrocatalyst for Urea Electrolysis and
   Water Splitting
SO CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL
AB The liquid structures of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) based on hydrated metal halides and their application as electrolytes have been widely studied. However, little attention has been paid to the direct use of this type of DES in the preparation of micro-/nanomaterials. Herein, an FeCl3.6 H2O/urea DES was used in the one-step synthesis of NiFe-LDH_D with a nanoflower morphology. In alkaline media, this catalyst promoted excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of urea at potential of 1.32 V (vs. RHE) and for the oxygen-evolution reaction at a potential of 1.39 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These results were superior to the results with NiFe-LDH/NF that was obtained from an aqueous solution of FeCl3, as well as most of the previously reported transition-metal catalysts. Furthermore, NiFe-LDH_D/NF could be readily implemented as both a cathode and an anode for the electrolysis of urea and water splitting. The use of hydrated-metal-halide-based DESs for the preparation of LDH catalysts through a dipping-redox strategy should both enrich the research of DESs and offer guidance for the rational surface engineering of catalysts for the electrolysis of urea and overall water splitting with high performance.

TI Oxidized cornstarch - Urea wood adhesive for interior particleboard
   production
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES
AB Herein, a green binder formulation which contains oxidized corn starch (OCS) and urea (U) was developed for wood-based panel production. The obtained adhesive structure was strengthened by using titanium dioxide nanoparticle (nano-TiO2). Solid content and viscosity of the synthesized adhesives were determined. Chemical, crystalline structure and morphological properties of the synthesized adhesives, native and oxidized corn starch were investigated. Moreover, laboratory scale particleboards were produced by using a hybrid adhesive system. Mechanical tests of the boards were performed to examine the quality of OCS - U based adhesive and the obtained results evaluated in dry medium (P2) according to European norms EN 312 (2010). Formaldehyde content of the boards were measured by using the perforator method. The results showed that developed OCS - U based adhesive can be used with traditional melamine urea formaldehyde resin (MUF) as a hybrid adhesive system for producing particleboards with low formaldehyde content.

TI Interface Engineering of MOF-Derived NiMoO4@NiFeP Core-Shell Nanorods
   for Energy-Saving Hydrogen Evolution via Urea Electrolysis
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The development of multifunctional and durable electrocatalysts for hydrogen energy production via an energy-saving avenue is urgently desired. Urea electrolysis by substituting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a more oxidizable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been widely used to realize energy-saving hydrogen production. Herein, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived interface-engineered NiMoO4@NiFeP core-shell nanorods as electrocatalysts are constructed. Due to the integration of the advantages of the interface synergistic effect between the NiMoO4 core and NiFeP shell, the as-fabricated NiMoO4@NiFeP electrocatalyst demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic perform-ance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), OER, and UOR. In the urea electrolysis system, an ultralow cell voltage of 1.30 V is needed to drive the current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is 140 mV lower than that of the conventional overall water splitting system. The cost-efficient and high-performance NiMoO4@NiFeP electrocatalyst paves the way to explore practical applications of energy-saving hydrogen production.

TI Preparation of gold nanoparticles supported on
   Nb2O5 by deposition precipitation and deposition
   reduction methods and their catalytic activity for CO oxidation
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB Nanoparticulate gold catalysts supported on niobium oxides (Nb2O5) were prepared by different deposition methods. The deposition precipitation (DP) method, DP method with urea, deposition reduction (DR) method and one-pot method were used to prepare a 1 wt% Au/Nb2O5 catalyst. Layered-type Nb2O5 synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Nb2O5(HT)) was the most suitable as a support among various types of Nb2O5 including commercially available Nb2O5 samples. It appeared that the large BET surface area of Nb2O5(HT) enabled the dispersion of gold as nanoparticles (NPs). Gold NPs with a mean diameter of about 5 nm were deposited by both the DP method and DR method on Nb2O5(HT) under an optimized condition. The temperature for 50% CO conversion for Au/Nb2O5(HT) prepared by the DR method was 73 degrees C. Without deposition of gold, Nb2O5(HT) showed no catalytic activity for CO oxidation even at 250 degrees C. Therefore, the enhancement of the activity by deposition of gold was remarkable. This simple Au/Nb2O5 catalyst will expand the types of gold catalysts to acidic supports, giving rise to new applications. (C) 2016, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI Lignin reinforcement of urea-crosslinked starch films for reduction of
   starch biodegradability to improve slow nitrogen release properties
   under natural aerobic soil condition
SO E-POLYMERS
AB The urea-crosslinked starch (UcS) film has a major drawback of very rapid biodegradability when applied as slow release fertilizer in soil. Lignin reinforcement of the UcS was used to prepare composite films, aimed to reduce the starch biodegradability and slow the release of nitrogen in aerobic soil condition. Study results revealed that mineralization of the composite films was delayed from 6.40 to 13.58% more than UcS film. Inhibition of composite films mixing with soil, the Michaelis-Menten reaction rates for a-amylase were inhibited similar to 1.72-2.03 times whereas the Michaelis-Menten reaction rates for manganese peroxidase were increased similar to 1.07-1.41 times compared to UcS film. Saccharides-glucose, maltose and maltotriose demonstrated that their rates of formation (zero-order reaction) and depletion (first-order reaction); both were slowed more in aerobic soil which received the composite films. Increasing of lignin in composite films, the acid to aldehyde ratios of vanillyl and syringyl phenols of the lignin declined from 1.18 to 1.17 (similar to 0.76%) and 1.59-1.56 (similar to 1.78%), respectively. The diffusivity of nitrogen was effectively slowed 0.66-0.94 times by the lignin in composite films and showed a "Fickian diffusion" mechanism (release exponent n = 0.095-0.143).

TI Neutrophilic bacteria are responsible for autotrophic ammonia oxidation
   in an acidic forest soil
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Increasing evidence suggests that autotrophic ammonia oxidation in acidic soils is largely performed by archaea. However, ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are also found in acidic soils, and mechanisms have been demonstrated that enable the growth of AOB in low pH soils. This work used DNA stable isotope probing to examine the response of autotrophic ammonia oxidizers in an acidic forest soil (pH 5.0) following urea amendment. After application, increases in nitrate concentrations correlated only with increases in AOB and not ammonia oxidizing archaeal (AOA) amoA gene abundance, indicating that AOB may be responsible for urea derived ammonia oxidation. To identify growing autotrophic populations associated with ammonia oxidation, qPCR and high throughput sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons demonstrated that (CO2)-C-13 was assimilated by Nitrosospira AOB rather than archaeal ammonia oxidizing populations, and Nitrospira-associated nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Phylogenetic analysis of amoA genes demonstrated that the active ammonia oxidizers were closely related to neutrophilic Nitrosospira multiformis within Nitrosospira cluster 3a.2. These results demonstrate that AOB can dominate ammonia oxidation in acidic soils under specific conditions.

TI Integrated omics and gene expression analysis identifies the loss of
   metabolite-metabolite correlations in small cell lung cancer
SO ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
AB Background and objective: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive type of lung carcinoma with high metastatic potential and chemoresistance upon relapse. Cancer cells remodel the existing metabolic pathways for their benefits and the perturbations in cellular metabolism are the hallmark of cancer. However, the extent of these changes remains largely unknown for SCLC.
   Materials and methods: We characterized the metabolic perturbations in SCLC cells (SCLCC) by metabolomics. Large-scale correlation analysis was performed between metabolites. Targeted proteomics and gene expression analysis were employed to investigate the changes of key enzymes and genes in the disturbed pathways.
   Results: We found dramatic decrease of metabolite-metabolite correlations in SCLCC compared with normal control cells and non-small cell lung cancer cells. Pathway analysis revealed that the loss of correlations was associated with the alternations of fatty acid oxidation, urea cycle, and purine salvage pathway in SCLCC. Targeted proteomics and gene expression analysis confirmed significant changes of the expression for the key enzymes and genes in the pathways in SCLCC including the upregulation of carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 (urea cycle) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (fatty acid oxidation), and the downregulation of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase in purine salvage pathway.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated the loss of metabolite-metabolite correlations in SCLCC associated with the upregulation of fatty acid oxidation and urea cycle and the downregulation of purine salvage pathways. Our findings provide insights into the metabolic reprogramming in SCLCC and highlight the potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of SCLC.

TI An Insight on the Electrocatalytic Mechanistic Study of Pristine Ni MOF
   (BTC) in Alkaline Medium for Enhanced OER and UOR
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Hydrogen production plays a major role in technologies for renewable energy storage. Water and urea electrolysis (WE, UE) are promising processes in this regard. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively, are limiting the efficiency of the overall process. As catalysts for these reactions, metal-organic frameworks (MOF) have gained increasing attention due to their combinations and co-existence of metal and organic moiety properties. Here, we investigated the catalytic behavior of Ni MOF (1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC)) towards OER and UOR in alkaline medium on carbon paper (CP) as a support. The Ni MOF exhibits 346 mV overpotential (eta) at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), 79.03 Ag-1 specific-mass activity at 400 mV of eta than compared to wet chemically prepared (WCP) NiO and RuO2 for OER in 1 M KOH. Meanwhile, approximate to 230 mV of at 10 mAcm(-2) current density with appreciable stability for 12 hours for Ni MOF in 30% KOH was also observed. For UOR in UE, Ni MOF shows an onset potential of 1.34 V vs. RHE and 63.15 mAcm(-2) current density at 1.5 V vs RHE in 1 M KOH in the presence of 1 M urea. The observed results of OER and UOR catalytic behavior are better than wet chemically prepared (WCP) NiO and noble benchmark RuO2 catalyst under identical conditions. The results suggested that the MOF plays a major role in enhancing the catalytic activity by the facile formation of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH, stability and electronic properties due to their porous and interconnected structure.

TI Amorphous iron-doped nickel boride with facilitated structural
   reconstruction and dual active sites for efficient urea electrooxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Designing transition metal-based catalysts for efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is important for realizing energy-saving hydrogen production via urea-rich (waste)water electrolysis. Herein, we have developed an iron-doped amorphous nickel boride electrocatalyst (aFe-NiB) for UOR. Compared with the undoped and crystalline counterparts, aFe-NiB exhibits a higher activity and the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm-2 can be attained at 1.298 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Coupled with an efficient hydrogen evolution catalyst, the aFe-NiB-assisted urine electrolyzer can attain a 46 times higher H2 production rate than the water electrolyzer at 1.50 V. Further study reveals a crystallinity-dependent structure self-reconstruction process during UOR. aFe-NiB attains complete phase evolution from boride to electroactive Fe-doped NiOOH. In addi-tion, density functional theory calculations imply that Fe dopants can improve intrinsic catalytic activity via electronic structure regulation of the self-evolved NiOOH and forming heterogeneous bimetallic active sites for UOR. This study provides meaningful insights into the crystallinity-dependent UOR performance and effective strategies to develop efficient UOR (pre)catalysts with dual active sites. Significantly, the demonstrated direct wastewater (urine) electrolysis paves the way for net zero buildings-targeted human waste reutilization.

TI Effect of deposition potential and KOH concentration on ethanol
   oxidation reaction with Pd nanoparticles electrodeposited on glassy
   carbon from reline
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) are deposited electrochemically on the glassy carbon electrode surface using PdCl2 dissolved in a deep eutectic solvent composed of choline chloride and urea (reline). The morphology and particle size of the PdNPs are determined from SEM exhibiting a homogeneous distribution with potential deposition depending on particle size. The particles display a core-shell morphology, consisting of Pd(0) as the core and Pd (OH)2 as the shell. The ethanol oxidation reaction, EOR, is evaluated at different KOH concentrations. The electrocatalyst with the highest mass activity is achieved at -750 mV potential deposition and 1 M KOH, exhibiting 3126 +/- 606 mAmgPd- 1. However, when 0.1 M KOH is used the mass activity decreases to one-third the value obtained at 1 M KOH. Notwithstanding, the mass activity displayed by these PdNPs is superior to that reported for other Pd-based nanoparticles synthesized using more complex, time-consuming and costly methods reported in the literature.

TI Recyclable anhydride catalyst for H2O2 oxidation:
   N-oxidation of pyridine derivatives
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The catalytic efficiency and recyclability of poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (Od-MA) and poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-isobutylene) (Bu-MA) were evaluated for use in the development of a metal-free, reusable catalyst for the oxidation of pyridines to pyridine N-oxides in the presence of H2O2. The Od-MA catalyst was easily recovered via filtration with recovery yields exceeding 99.8%. The catalyst retained its activity after multiple uses and did not require any treatment for reuse. The Od-MA and H2O2 catalytic system described herein is eco-friendly, operationally simple, and cost-effective; thus, it is industrially applicable. Od-MA and H2O2 could potentially be used in place of percarboxylic acid as an oxidant in a wide range of oxidation reactions.

TI Urea synthesis via electrocatalytic oxidative coupling of CO with
   NH3 on Pt
SO NATURE CATALYSIS
AB Electrochemical conversion of CO to chemicals containing C-N bonds offers an appealing route to store renewable electricity and mitigate CO2 emission, as CO2 can be efficiently transformed to CO. Previous electrocatalysis research has primarily focused on cathodic reactions, which are impeded by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction and limited electron efficiency. Here we present a urea synthesis approach via electrocatalytic oxidative coupling between CO and NH3 on commercial Pt catalysts. We demonstrate an optimal selectivity of approximately 70% for urea and remain above 50% throughout a wide potential window with an electrocatalytic C-N bond formation rate of up to 100 mmol h(-1) g(catalyst)(-1). In mechanistic investigations, we propose that the oxidative coupling of CO and NH3 on Pt leads to cyanate formation, followed by the W & ouml;hler reaction to form urea. This approach offers a practical route for urea production with high electron efficiency by enabling Pt-catalysed reactions between CO and NH3.

TI Ni-foam supported Co(OH)F and Co-P nanoarrays for energy-efficient
   hydrogen production via urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB It is an urgent requirement to develop non-precious metal-based catalysts with excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability to accelerate the development of hydrogen generation via energy-efficient routes. Herein, a facile and scalable strategy was developed to synthesize both rod-like Co(OH) F and Co-P nanoarrays supported on Ni-foam, denoted as Co(OH) F/NF and Co-P/NF, respectively. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that Co-P/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), delivering a low overpotential of 70 mV and 43 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and acid media, respectively. Furthermore, the as-prepared Co(OH) F/NF contributes to an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a low oxidation potential of about 1.5 V at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the Co(OH) F/NF also can enable highly efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) electrocatalysis, which can be utilized to substitute OER to lower the overpotential and thus reduce electrical energy consumption during H2-production. As a proof of concept, full water-splitting measurements were performed with Co-P/NF and Co(OH) F/NF as cathode and anode, respectively, in 1 M KOH with 0.7 M urea. The Co-P/NFkCo(OH) F/NF electrode is capable of producing a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a cell potential of only 1.42 V, which is 230 mV less than that for the urea-free counterpart, demonstrating its potential feasibility in practical applications of energy-efficient hydrogen production.

TI Cyanate and urea are substrates for nitrification by Thaumarchaeota in
   the marine environment
SO NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
AB Ammonia-oxidizing archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota are among the most abundant marine microorganisms(1). These organisms thrive in the oceans despite ammonium being present at low nanomolar concentrations(2,3). Some Thaumarchaeota isolates have been shown to utilize urea and cyanate as energy and N sources through intracellular conversion to ammonium(4-6). Yet, it is unclear whether patterns observed in culture extend to marine Thaumarchaeota, and whether Thaumarchaeota in the ocean directly utilize urea and cyanate or rely on co-occurring microorganisms to break these substrates down to ammonium. Urea utilization has been reported for marine ammonia-oxidizing communities(7-10), but no evidence of cyanate utilization exists for marine ammonia oxidizers. Here, we demonstrate that in the Gulf of Mexico, Thaumarchaeota use urea and cyanate both directly and indirectly as energy and N sources. We observed substantial and linear rates of nitrite production from urea and cyanate additions, which often persisted even when ammonium was added to micromolar concentrations. Furthermore, single-cell analysis revealed that the Thaumarchaeota incorporated ammonium-, urea- and cyanate-derived N at significantly higher rates than most other microorganisms. Yet, no cyanases were detected in thaumarchaeal genomic data from the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, we tested cyanate utilization in Nitrosopumilus maritimus, which also lacks a canonical cyanase, and showed that cyanate was oxidized to nitrite. Our findings demonstrate that marine Thaumarchaeota can use urea and cyanate as both an energy and N source. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that urea and cyanate are substrates for ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota throughout the ocean.

TI Combining Cu-SSZ-13 with TiO2: promotion of urea
   decomposition and influence on SCR
SO REACTION CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Urea is applied as an ammonia source for SCR in diesel vehicles, but incomplete urea decomposition may lead to insufficiency of NH3 and deposition of solid by-products. To improve the urea decomposition activity of Cu-SSZ-13 SCR catalysts, Cu-SSZ-13 was combined with TiO2 nanoparticles by a simple impregnation method. TiO2/Cu-SSZ-13 composites exhibited lowered decomposition temperatures of urea and related solid by-products. Thus, the composited catalysts showed higher NOx conversion and a lower amount of urea-related deposits than unmodified Cu-SSZ-13 in a simulated urea deposition scenario. The superiority of the urea decomposition activity of the composited catalysts was maintained upon 800 degrees C hydrothermal aging due to stabilized anatase over the catalysts according to XRD and Raman spectroscopy. H-2-TPR, UV-vis, and STEM revealed the formation of Cu-Ti-O species due to Cu-Ti interactions, which was adverse to SCR activity, but no extra hydrothermal aging effect was observed on the composited catalysts compared with unmodified Cu-SSZ-13. This work showed the potential to improve the low-temperature urea-SCR performance of Cu-SSZ-13 via TiO2 modification.

TI Synergistic effect of Cu and Ag on porous (Cu, Ag) co-doped
   CeO2 nanosheets for low-temperature CO oxidation
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB CeO2 with porous nanosheet structure was prepared by changing the calcination environment. The prepared CeO2 nanosheets had high specific surface area and porosity, which was suitable for supporting other active components. By the same synthesis conditions, a small amount of Cu and Ag was introduced into the synthesis system of CeO2 nanosheets respectively. The introduction of Cu or Ag did not significantly change the morphology of the prepared CeO2 nanosheets, but it notably improved the catalytic activity for CO oxidation. Therefore, considering the significant improvement of catalytic performance caused by the single doping of Cu or Ag, (Cu, Ag) were co-doped into the CeO2 system. The analysis of physical structure (XRD, BET, SEM and TEM) and surface chemical properties (XPS, Raman and H-2-TPR) showed that the (Cu, Ag) co-doping not only improved the dispersion of Cu and Ag species on the catalyst surface, but also increased the Ag0 and oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. The smaller Ag-0 crystallite size and the abundant oxygen vacancies made the catalyst easier to activate O-2 at low temperature, so the activity of the catalyst at low temperature was significantly enhanced compared to the CeO2 singly doped with Cu or Ag. At the same time, the high dispersion of CuAg species was conducive to electron transfer between Cu-Ag species and CeO2 support.

TI Transformation of Organonitrogen-Encapsulated MOFs into N-Doped
   Fe3O4@C Nanopolyhedron via CVD Super-Assembly for
   Photochemical Oxidation
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Development of nano-structured metal oxides/heteroatom composites with controlled components and structure for photochemical oxidation still remains a great challenge. Here, a new and versatile strategy is reported for transformation of organonitrogen-encapsulated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) into N-doped Fe3O4@C nanopolyhedron by chemical vapor deposition-induced super-assembly method. Strong confined interaction between organonitrogen guests (urea, thiourea, melamine, and dimethylimidazole) and Fe nodes of MOFs realizes reconstruction of crystal structure and introduction of N species. With the novel approach, the uniform dispersion of guests and perfect metallic/heteroatom interfacial is obtained. Compared with MOFs-derived Fe2O3/C, the heteroatom/defect-to-metal cluster charge transfer excitations lead N-doped Fe3O4@C to exhibit more superior activity for photocatalytic oxidation (turn-over frequencies as high as 3.72 h(-1)). It demonstrates that the introduction of abundant pyrrole-N and oxygen vacancies on carbon interface boosts the advance of photo-generated carrier transfer. The work offers a simple and promising strategy for the design of novel metal oxides/heteroatom composite with adjustable structure and functions.

TI Multifunctional characteristics of a one-dimensional bimetallic
   oxyhydroxide nanorod-coupled polyaniline interface for accelerated water
   and urea electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Designing an efficient and multifunctional electrocatalyst is central to hydrogen production technologies for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, we report the synthesis of nickel cobalt oxyhydroxide nanorods interfacially coupled with polyaniline-functionalized carbon fibers (NiCoOOH@PANi-CF) as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER, OER, and UOR. The NiCoOOH catalyst with oxygen vacancies effectively catalyzed these reactions, while the one-dimensional nanorods ruptured the gas bubbles accumulated on the catalyst's surface. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the PANi layers captured intermediate H+ ions/CO2 molecules and suppressed the recombination reactions. Owing to these multifunctional properties, the NiCoOOH@PANi-CF electrocatalyst demonstrated low HER overpotentials of 35, 30, and 110 mV (at 10 mA cm-2) in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, the interfacially coupled electrocatalyst exhibited outstanding durability for the HER, OER, and UOR. Post-catalysis assessment revealed that the PANi layers effectively coupled with the NiCoOOH catalyst and prevented catalyst delamination from the substrate. Urea electrolysis exhibited a full cell voltage of 1.39 V (at 10 mA cm-2), while water electrolysis showed a cell voltage of 1.51 V (at 10 mA cm-2), both results surpassing those of the most promising catalysts previously reported. This work demonstrates an innovative catalyst design possessing multifunctional properties to accelerate catalyst efficiency and durability.
   Designing an efficient and durable electrocatalyst is central to hydrogen production technologies such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and urea oxidation reaction.

TI Anion-regulated electronic communication in a cyclometalated diruthenium
   complex with a urea bridge
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB A combined study of electrochemical measurements, intervalence charge transfer analysis, and DFT calculations suggests that the degree of urea-mediated electronic coupling between two cyclometalated ruthenium sites is enhanced by the coordination of urea with Br- or Cl- via hydrogen bonding. In contrast, the redox waves of the diruthenium complex become highly irreversible in the presence of relatively strong basic anions such as H2PO4- , F-, or OAc-. This work demonstrates that the anion-urea interaction can be employed to regulate the electronic coupling and electron transfer between redox-active sites, suggesting the potential applications of the urea-functionalized diruthenium complex in anion sensing and stimuli-responsive molecular electronics.

TI Efficient ammonia oxidation by Pseudomonas citronellolis
   strain YN-21 under strongly acidic conditions: Performance and mechanism
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Ammonia oxidation microorganisms generally tend to have low rates of ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions, as the protonated ammonia is not a substrate for ammonia monooxygenase. In this work, heterotrophic ammonia oxidation bacteria (HAOB) Pseudomonas citronellolis strain YN-21 showed high efficiency in removing NH4+ (12.7 mg/L/h) even at initial pH 4.5. The potential acid resistance mechanisms (H+ efflux, H+ consumption, and production of alkaline substances) maintained intracellular pH neutrality. Transcriptome analysis showed that genes involved in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ABC transporter and nitrogen metabolism were significantly up-regulated, which facilitated the rapid removal of NH4+ in an acidic environment. Moreover, urea could be used as an alternative nitrogen source for YN-21 in a strongly acidic environment, and the production of NH3 from urea hydrolysis provided a substrate for ammonia oxidation. These results provide new insights into efficient ammonia oxidation in acidic environments.

   Rh/TiO2 Nanostructures and Their Catalytic Activity on the CO
   Oxidation at Low Temperature
SO TOPICS IN CATALYSIS
AB Au/TiO2, Pd/TiO2, Pt/TiO2 and Rh/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized by the deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU) and sol-gel (SG) methods to elucidate the influence of the preparation method on the catalytic activity in the CO oxidation at low temperature. In all cases, the metal loading was 1 wt%. The effect of the synthesis method was remarkable for the Au/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 materials and less important for the Pt/TiO2 and Rh/TiO2 materials. However, for the four materials, the DPU method revealed the most active materials at 0 degrees C with respect to the sol-gel method. Au/TiO2 and Rh/TiO2, obtained by the DPU method, were active at temperatures below 0 degrees C and showed outstanding catalytic activity in comparison with the Pd/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts. Density Functional Theory based calculations on M-13/TiO2 (M = Au, Pd, Pt or Rh) structures revealed a superior charge transfer from a defective support to Au, while Rh triggered O-2 bond scission in the oxygen vacancy site located in the metal-support interface.

TI Hydrothermal synthesis of Mn3O4 nanorods modified
   indium tin oxide electrode as an efficient nanocatalyst towards direct
   urea electrooxidation
SO PLOS ONE
AB Control fabrication of metal-oxide nanocatalysts for electrochemical reactions has received considerable research attention. Here, manganese oxide (Mn3O4) nanorods modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes were prepared based on the in-situ one-step hydrothermal methods. The nanorods were well characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. The results showed the formation of pure crystalline Mn3O4 nanorods with a length of approximately 1.4 mu m and a thickness of approximately 100 +/- 30 nm. The Mn3O4 nanorod-modified ITO electrodes were used for accelerating urea electrochemical oxidation at room temperature using cyclic and square wave voltammetry techniques. The results indicated that the modified electrode demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic performance toward urea electrooxidation in an alkaline medium over concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 4 mol/L. The modified electrode showed high durability, attaining more than 88% of its baseline performance after 150 cycles; furthermore, the chronoamperometry technique demonstrated high stability. Thus, the Mn3O4 nanorod-modified ITO electrode is a promising anode for direct urea fuel cell applications.

TI Multi-win situation of wastewater purification, carbon emission
   reduction and resource utilization: Conversion of refractory organics
   and nitrate to urea and ammonia in a flow-through electrochemical
   integrated system
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The advanced oxidation process is an efficient technology for the degradation and detoxification of refractory organics to ensure water safety. However, most researches focus on improving pollutant degradation but overlook carbon emission and resource utilization. In this study, a flow-through electrochemical integrated system was constructed to simultaneously realize bisphenol A (BPA) oxidation into small non-toxic organics and CO2, and generated CO2 coupled with nitrate-containing wastewater conversion to urea and ammonia on a porous cathode (Zr-Fe/CN). The synergistic effect between anodic BPA oxidation with cathodic CO2 and NO(3)(-)reduction improves the electron utilization efficiency and thus increasing the BPA degradation, urea yield rate (UYR) and NH3 yield rate (NYR) by 13.4 % 18.4 % and 8.3 %, respectively. Furthermore, the flow-through operation mode significantly increased the mass transfer efficiency and quickly carried generated CO2 from the anode into the cathode to improve CO2 utilization efficiency. Compared to the parallel plate electrode reactor, the BPA degradation efficiency, UYR and NYR in the flow-through reactor increased from 59.46 % to 84.49 % (the initial concentration of BPA was 40 mg/L), 9.94 mmol h(-1) g(-1) to 19.55 mmol h(-1) g(-1), and 80.31 mmol h(-1) g(-1) to 106.06 mmol h(-1) g(-1) within 60 min, respectively. Moreover, the total carbon conversion efficiency (from BPA to urea) increased from 20.2 % to 42.4 % and the total Faraday efficiency (FE) increased from 78.6 % to 96.3 %. This work provides a multi-win strategy of harmless, resource-based and carbon emission reduction for wastewater treatment.

TI Ternary Interface of Pt|Few-Layered N-rGO|TiN for the Boasting
   Electrocatalytic Activity in Ethylene Glycol Oxidation
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB The efficient electrochemical oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) requires the superior synergism of platinum (Pt) based composites, which depends on the formation of effective interface between the components. In this paper, Pt loaded on co-supporter of TiN and N-doped reduced graphene oxide (Pt/TiN @ N-rGO) composite is obtained by an in situ calcination of TiN @ N-rGO followed with the targeted growth of Pt nanoparticles at the junction of TiN|N-rGO. As a result, Pt/TiN @ N-rGO electrode with medium molar ratio of urea to TiCl4 (R=10) and the ideal ternary interface of Pt|few layered N-rGO|TiN exhibited exceptionally high catalytic mass activity (343.9 mA mg(-1)Pt) and long-term durability (117 mA mg(-1)Pt after continuous 1200 min operation) for EG oxidation in acid, compared to other Pt/TiN @ N-rGO composites and commercial Pt/C (41.1 mA mg(-1)Pt). The promoted performance is attributed to the synergies at ternary interface, involving the highest electrochemically active surface areas due to more exposed active sites of Pt nanoparticles, the best electrical conductivity ascribed to the incorporation of few layered N-rGO, and excellent CO tolerance with the assistance of TiN.

TI Urea-Modified Carbon Nitrides: Enhancing Photocatalytic Hydrogen
   Evolution by Rational Defect Engineering
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The primary amine groups on the heptazine-based polymer melon, also known as graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), can be replaced by urea groups using a two-step postsynthetic functionalization. Under simulated sunlight and optimum Pt loading, this urea-functionalized carbon nitride has one of the highest activities among organic and polymeric photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution with methanol as sacrificial donor, reaching an apparent quantum efficiency of 18% and nearly 30 times the hydrogen evolution rate compared to the nonfunctionalized counterpart. In the absence of Pt, the urea-derivatized material evolves hydrogen at a rate over four times that of the nonfunctionalized one. Since defects are conventionally accepted to be the active sites in graphitic carbon nitride for photocatalysis, the work here is a demonstrated example of defect engineering, where the catalytically relevant defect is inserted rationally for improving the intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the work provides a retrodictive explanation for the general observation that g-C3N4 prepared from urea performs better than those prepared from dicyandiamide and melamine. In-depth analyses of the spent photocatalysts and computational modeling suggest that inserting the urea group causes a metal-support interaction with the Pt cocatalyst, thus facilitating interfacial charge transfer to the hydrogen evolving centers.

TI Ni2P nanocrystals embedded Ni-MOF nanosheets supported on
   nickel foam as bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea electrolysis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB It's highly desired but challenging to synthesize self-supporting nanohybrid made of conductive nanoparticles with metal organic framework (MOF) materials for the application in the electrochemical field. In this work, we report the preparation of Ni2P embedded Ni-MOF nanosheets supported on nickel foam through partial phosphidation (Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF). The self-supporting Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF was directly tested as electrode for urea electrolysis. When served as anode for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), it only demands 1.41 V (vs RHE) to deliver a current of 100 mA cm(-2). And the overpotential of Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction HER was only 66 mV, remarkably lower than Ni2P/NF (133 mV). The exceptional electrochemical performance was attributed to the unique structure of Ni2P@Ni-MOF and the well exposed surface of Ni2P. Furthermore, the Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF demonstrated outstanding longevity for both HER and UOR. The electrolyzer constructed with Ni2P@Ni-MOF/NF as bifunctional electrode can attain a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage as low as 1.65 V. Our work provides new insights for prepare MOF based nanohydrid for electrochemical application.

TI Investigation on the Correlation between Inclusions and High Temperature
   Urea Corrosion Behavior in Ferritic Stainless Steel
SO METALS
AB The influence of inclusion size and number density on high-temperature urea corrosion (HTUC) behavior of ferritic stainless steels was investigated in a simulated working environment of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system in commercial vehicles. There is a positive correlation between the control level of inclusions and the resistance of HTUC. By slightly increasing the content of Nb in ferritic stainless steels, the inclusions, especially TiN, were significantly refined, and thus displayed an improvement in HTUC resistance. The interface between inclusions and the matrix becomes a fast channel for chromium precipitation during high-temperature nitriding induced by the decomposition of urea. Chromium nitrides will precipitate around the inclusions and wrap the inclusions, which will decrease the chromium equivalent of the matrix and reduce the resistance of ferritic stainless steels to HTUC. In addition, the high-temperature oxidation accompanied with thermal fatigue also makes the inclusions more likely to become the crack nucleation source, which can accelerate the material thinning and reduce its service life.

TI Application of metal chalcogenide-based anodic electrocatalyst toward
   substituting oxygen evolution reaction in water splitting
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB Electrochemical water splitting for producing hydrogen has received increasing attention. However, the large overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a bottleneck in water splitting. Exploiting value-added alternative reactions to replace the OER semi-reaction in water splitting can not only produce valuable products at both electrodes, but also reduce the overpotential of water splitting. Recently, metal chalcogenides (sulfides and selenides) have been widely studied in electrocatalytic reactions. This review concentrates on the recent application of metal chalcogenides in value-added anodic reactions by replacing the OER during electrochemical water splitting, including urea oxidation reaction (UOR), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural electrochemical oxidation reaction (HMF-EOR), which provides the guidance for the rational design of advanced metal chalcogenide electrocatalysts in renewable energy.

TI Aptamer Turn-On SERS/RRS/Fluorescence Tri-mode Platform for Ultra-trace
   Urea Determination Using Fe/N-Doped Carbon Dots
SO FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Sensitive and selective methods for the determination of urea in samples such as dairy products are important for quality control and health applications. Using ammonium ferric citrate as a precursor, Fe/N-codoped carbon dots (CDFeN) were prepared by a hydrothermal procedure and characterized in detail. CDFeN strongly catalyzes the oxidation of 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by H2O2 to turn on an indicator molecular reaction, forming an oxidized tetramethylbenzidine (TMBox) probe with surface-enhanced Raman scattering, resonance Rayleigh scattering, and fluorescence (SERS, RRS, and FL) signals at 1,598 cm(-1), 370 nm, and 405 nm, respectively. The urea aptamer (Apt) can turn off the indicator reaction to reduce the tri-signals, and the addition of urea turns on the indicator reaction to linearly enhance the SERS/RRS/FL intensity. Thus, a novel Apt turn-on tri-mode method was developed for the assay determination of ultra-trace urea with high sensitivity, good selectivity, and accuracy. Trace adenosine triphosphate and estradiol can also be determined by the Apt-CDFeN catalytic analytical platform.

TI Synergistic enhancement of peroxymonosulfate activation by bimetallic
   (Bi, Fe) supported NaHCO3 activated and urea-modified biochar
   for sulfamethoxazole degradation: DFT calculations, toxicity
   assessments, and mechanistic studies
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Advanced oxidation processes based on Fenton-like reactions to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for degrading antibiotics face challenges due to insufficient PMS activation and Fe (III)/Fe (II) recycling. Therefore, developing iron-based bimetallic catalyst for sufficient PMS activation and Fe (III)/Fe (II) recycling is critical. Herein, bimetallic (Bi, Fe) NPs supported NaHCO3 activated and urea-modified biochar (Bi-Fe/N-BC) composite were synthesized through two-step hydrothermal method. The Bi-Fe/N-BC/PMS system reached 96.6% conversion, which is approximately 6.01 times greater than BC (k = 0.0110 min(-1)), 2.44 times greater than N-BC (k = 0.0273 min(-1)), and 1.84 times greater than Bi-Fe/BC (k = 0.0362 min(-1)) and 1.78 times greater than Bi-Fe/N-BC system (k = 0.0374). The enhanced performance could be attributed to Fe (III)/Fe (II) recycling facilitated by Bi (I)/Bi (III) and Bi (II)/Bi (III) couples and the formation of nitrogen-active sites, which resulted in synergistic enhancement between the non-radical and radical mechanisms. Furthermore, the composite Bi-Fe/N-BC exhibited a higher surface area (147.50 m(2)/g) than Bi-Fe/BC (103.26 m(2)/g), increasing the number of active sites accessible for PMS activation. Reactive species analysis revealed the presence of SO4 center dot-, center dot OH, O-1(2)center dot-, and O-1(2) species, with SO4 center dot- and O-1(2) were major contributors. The impact of coexisting inorganic anions revealed that the HCO3- ion exhibited the most pronounced inhibitory effect due to the production of less reactive CO3 center dot- radical. This study combined experimental and computational methods to enrich our understanding of the activation mechanisms, transformation pathways, toxicity of intermediates, and factors governing the N-BC-supported Bi-Fe/PMS system.

TI Fabrication of Phytic Acid/Urea Co-Modified Bamboo Biochar and Its
   Application as Green Flame Retardant for Polylactic Acid Resins
SO POLYMERS
AB It is of great significance to develop green, sustainable additives to improve the thermal stability and flame retardancy of biopolymers. In this work, a synergistic modification of P/N elements to bamboo biochar (mBC) was successfully achieved by grafting a reaction of phytic acid and urea with preoxidized bamboo biochar. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance and scanning electron microscope determinations of the mBC demonstrated a successive grafting of phytic acid and urea to the originally porous surface. The ground mBC was blended with polylactic acid (PLA) to prepare mBC/PLA composites by extrusion and hot pressing. Mechanical strength studies showed a compromise in rigidity, which might originate from the mBC overdose and its limited miscibility with the resin. The thermogravimetric results supported the fact that the enhancement of thermal stability and flame retardancy of the composites with the mBC dosage, which showed that the mBC dosage in the PLA composites was not only lower than that of the conventional flame retardants, but also outperformed the counterparts using BC modified by inorganic phosphoric acid and urea. The mBC was prone to accelerate the earlier decomposition of the composites (30 degrees C lower in decomposition) and generate a continuous, dense residual carbon layer, which provides an effective shield resisting the mass and heat transfer between the combustion area and the underlying composite matrix. Only 10 wt% of mBC dosage could achieve a V-0 rating (UL94) for the composite, with a higher limiting oxygen index up to 28.3% compared to 20.7% for that of the virgin PLA; the cone colorimetric results also suggested that the flame retardancy had been greatly improved for all composites. In this work, biobased P-/N-containing bamboo biochar would be expected as a nontoxic biochar-based flame retardant that serves as green filler in polymer composites.

TI Gross nitrogen transformations in grassland soil react differently to
   urea stabilisers under laboratory and field conditions
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB A laboratory and a field study were conducted on a permanent grassland soil in Northern Ireland to investigate the effects of urea in combination with N process inhibitors such as the urease inhibitor N (butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) and/or the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) on soil N dynamics. Urea enriched with n-butyl N-15 to 60 atom % was applied to soil at a rate of 100 mu g N g(-1) dry soil in the laboratory and 100 kg N ha(-1) in the field. A numerical N-15 tracing model was used to quantify several simultaneously occurring gross N transformation rates in both studies. The changes in soil nitrate (NOT) and ammonium (NE4+) concentrations and N-15 enrichment over a 25-day period as well as the concentration and N-15 enrichment of plant N at harvest were used to model soil gross N transformations. The results showed that the effect of N process inhibitors varied firstly between laboratory and field studies and secondly whether the inhibitors were applied individually or in combination. Overall DCD had a greater effect on the major soil N transformations than NBPT; reducing oxidation of NHS4+, total nitrification, net NOT produced, total mineralisation and the net adsorption of NH4+ at both laboratory and field scale. The effect of DCD was similar for these transformations whether applied alone or co-applied with NBPT. In contrast NBPT had no significant effect on oxidation of NH4+, total nitrification, total mineralisation or total immobilisation compared to urea in the field, while the effect on these transformations in the laboratory was significant. The contrasting effects of inhibitors on gross N transformations between laboratory and field may relate to the differences in experimental conditions, e.g. soil preparation, environmental conditions and the contribution of plant biomass. To obtain a more realistic assessment of gross soil N transformations in situ, it is essential that laboratory experiments are supplemented with field studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI One step closer to the low-temperature CO oxidation over non-noble
   CuO/CeO2 nanocatalyst: The effect of CuO loading
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Concerning the catalytic field of CO oxidation for designing the cost-effective, stable, and highly active catalysts based on CuO/CeO2 nanocomposites, in this work, the urea-nitrate combustion method was used to synthesize a series of CuO/CeO2 catalysts with different CuO loadings (at%Cu) to test their catalytic activity in the CO oxidation, to find out the optimum at%Cu which allows the CuO/CeO2 composite to perform a higher activity in close to room-like temperature. The at%Cu of 0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% were set up to obtain a catalyst series. The resulting catalysts were characterized using EDX, PXRD, SEM, and other methods. It was shown that the CuO loading caused changes in the phase composition (crystalline CeO2, amorphous or crystalline CuO), the crystallite size (5-10 nm for CeO2; 20-33 nm for CuO), and the specific surface area (12.2-85.8 m(2)/g), as well as in the morphological and pore structure. These factors comprehensively influenced the catalytic performance of the samples. The initial temperature (ti) toward CO oxidation for the best catalyst obtained in this study belonged to the low-temperature region (ti < 50 degrees C). The temperature for 50% CO conversion (t50%) of the best catalysts was less than 100 degrees C that was much lower compared to pure CeO2 (t50% approximate to 312 degrees C). For CO oxidation, the active sites on the surface were correlated with the interactions between copper and cerium oxides; the improvement in catalytic activity is also related to the high concentration of oxygen vacancies or high oxygen storage capacity of the catalysts. Besides, the advantage in the specific surface area of the samples played as one of the decisive factors to the higher CO conversion. It was noted that the increase of CuO loading into the CuO/CeO2 catalysts exceeded 20% doesn't lead to a further decrease in the temperature of CO oxidation. Thus, the optimum catalyst composition was determined to be the CuO/CeO2-20, and its properties were studied by the methods of Raman, XPS, TEM, H-2-TPR, and EDS in detail. Results proved a strong synergistic effect - the coexistence of redox pairs Ce4+/Ce3+-Cu2+/Cu+, the formation of oxygen vacancies, as well as the presence of superficial lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species leading to improve the catalytic activity of CuO/CeO2-20 catalyst. Moreover, the stability of the CuO/CeO2-20 catalyst was investigated and excellent results were obtained. We believe that the activity in CO oxidation of the CuO/CeO2-20 sample can even be enhanced by doping oxides of the other rare-earth and transition metals, which requires further study.

TI Oxygen vacancies confined in ultrathin nickel oxide nanosheets for
   enhanced electrocatalytic methanol oxidation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Owing to the relatively sluggish charge transport and reaction kinetics in nickel-based oxides, the electrocatalytic efficiency for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is still far below what is expected. Herein, ultrathin NiO nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies is put forward as an applicable catalytic model to get in-depth insights into the role that oxygen vacancies play in MOR process. Theoretical investigations reveal that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies can not only enhance the electrical conductivity of NiO crystals, but also reduce the adsorption energy of methanol molecules onto the active surface, both of which are more favorable for optimizing the overall electrocatalytic MOR performance. Thanks to the ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) features and remarkably modulated electronic structures, ultrathin NiO nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies exhibit a dramatically improved electrocatalytic activity for MOR, which is significantly higher than that of the sample with less oxygen vacancies and bulk NiO. This work opens a promising and feasible pathway for the design and synthesis of highly efficient non-noble MOR catalysts.

TI Ultrathin nanosheet metal-organic framework@NiO/Ni nanorod composites
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks are a family of materials with great potential for electrocatalysis; however, these materials usually have the poor thermodynamic stability and require harsh preparation conditions. Here, we describe a facile approach for preparing ultrathin nanosheet metal-organic framework@NiO/Ni nanorods with increased stability and highly active sites compared with in case of pristine metal-organic frameworks. These peculiar hierarchical nanocomposites exhibit excellent properties for urea electrolysis, including abundant exposed active sites owing to their nanosheet-nanorod hierarchical structure, enriched Ni-species, and improved stability. The prepared composites demonstrate superior electrocatalytic performance toward the urea oxidation reaction with a low overpotential of only 170 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 48.1 mV dec(-1), and a low cell voltage of 1.42 V for overall urea electrolysis, with outstanding long-term durability (15,000 s with only 7.1% activity decay). This combination between metal-organic frameworks and materials with high thermodynamic stability offers a strategy for further development of excellent electrocatalysts.

AB In present study mesoporous titanium-cerium oxide materials with different composition were prepared by homogeneous precipitation with urea. The samples were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, XRD, UV-Vis, Raman, temperature programmed reduction and their catalytic properties were studied in methanol decomposition and oxidation of ethyl acetate. The effect of phase composition on the texture, structure and redox properties was discussed in close relation with their catalytic activity. It was found that the catalytic behavior of the samples in the methanol decomposition and ethyl acetate oxidation, could be successfully controlled by the Ti/Ce ratio.

TI Analysing the role of anions in the synthesis of catalytically active
   urea-based MOFs
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The synthesis of catalytically active metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with copper(ii) paddle-wheel clusters and urea-carboxylate linkers was achieved at room temperature in the presence of sulphate anions. The role of various anions in determining the MOF structure was analysed using X-ray diffraction. Structural analysis of the MOFs indicated that a two-fold interpenetrated rhombus grid (HI-101) was formed in the presence of sulphate anions, but a three-fold interpenetrated square grid network (HI-102) was obtained with nitrate and perchlorate anions. The experiment performed with various anions in the presence of sulphate anions also resulted in the formation of HI-101, indicating the selectivity of sulphate anions in the formation of the HI-101 framework. HI-101 proved to be an efficient catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2 at room temperature, the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes and the methanolysis of epoxides, but the other MOFs were not catalytically active. Thus, the size, charge and affinity of sulphate anions play an important role in generating a two-fold interpenetrated rhombus grid, which is crucial for catalytic reactions. This study shows that anion-templated synthesis could generate a versatile urea-based MOF catalyst for CO2 fixation and other reactions.

TI Association between advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and
   vascular calcification in uremic patients
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between serum advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and vascular calcification in uremic patients.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: The general data of included subjects were collected, and the serum AOPP, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), creatinine (Cre), Urea, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterin (LDL-C), hemoglobin (Hb) and albumin (ALB) were detected. Coronary artery computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and the coronary arterial calcification score (CACS) was calculated; the whole abdomen CT scan was performed and abdominal aortic calcification index (AACI) was calculated. SPSS 19.0 software was used for data analysis.
   RESULTS: The coronary artery CT and detection of serum indexes showed that AOPP in positive coronary arterial calcification group was significantly increased compared with that in negative coronary arterial calcification group (59.14 +/- 14.57 vs. 37.59 +/- 5.31) prnol/L. The whole abdomen CT and detection of serum indexes showed that AOPP in positive abdominal aortic calcification group was significantly increased compared with that in negative abdominal aortic calcification group (60.32 +/- 15.43 vs. 39.57 +/- 6.25) pmol/L. AOPP in severe calcification group was significantly higher than negative group (70.72 +/- 18.18 vs. 39.57 +/- 6.25) pmol/L. There were no significant differences in AOPP between hypertension and non-hypertension groups, diabetic nephropathy, and non-diabetic nephropathy groups. Correlation analysis showed that AOPP of uremic patients had a significantly positive correlation with log(10)([CACS+1]) and had a significantly positive correlation with inferior AACI.
   CONCLUSIONS: AOPP in positive coronary arterial calcification group and positive abdominal aortic calcification group was higher than that in negative group and AOPP in severe calcification group was significantly higher than that in negative group. AOPP of uremic patients has a significantly positive correlation with CACS and AACI.

TI Insight into surface properties of O2 plasma activated
   Au/TiO2 prepared by DPU in CO oxidation
SO CATALYSIS TODAY
AB Driven by excellent CO oxidation capability of gold nanoparticles M room temperature, a TiO2 supported Au nanoparticles (Au/TiO2) is synthesized by deposition-precipitation with urea (DPU). To solve the sintering issue of gold nanoparticles during activation process, atmospheric-pressure cold O-2 plasma is employed to activate the Au/TiO2 catalysts and compared with the conventional calcination. The plasma activated one (S-P) shows poorer activity compared to the calcined one (S-C). However, S-P with further TPD treatment (S-PT) shows the best catalytic activity among above-mentioned samples. To elucidate the plasma effect, TEM, XPS, UV-vis spectroscopy and in situ DRIFTS techniques are used for catalyst characterization. Based on TEM results, S-P sample has smaller particle size and narrower size distribution compared to S-C sample, while the high content of lowcoordinated Au atoms and the poisoning nitrate species over S-P are revealed by in situ DRIFTS. Upon further TPD treatment, the poisoning species occupying the active sites is desorbed from catalyst surface and the improvements in Au particle size and size distribution are maintained. The mechanism for plasma effect on activation of Au/TiO2 prepared by DPU is also discussed.

TI Revealing degradation of organic constituents of urine during the
   electrochemical oxidation of ciprofloxacin via boron-doped diamond anode
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a widely prescribed fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat various types of infections, including respiratory and digestive diseases. However, after uptake, unmetabolized CIP is excreted through both urine and feces and persists in the aquatic environment due to its inefficient removal in municipal wastewater facilities. This accumulation causes potential risks to the health of living organisms. The present work reports a study on the remediation of CIP in synthetic urine by electrochemical oxidation (ECO) using an undivided cell with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a stainless-steel cathode. The heterogeneous hydroxyl radical BDD(center dot OH) formed at the anode surface from water discharge, remaining adjacent to it due to its short half-life time, and the powerful free chlorine formed from Cl- oxidation were the pre-eminent oxidants. The influence of pH and current density (j) on CIP abatement was analyzed, rapidly attaining its overall removal at j >= 40 mA cm-2 within the pH range 3.0-9.0 thanks to the action of free chlorine. The CIP decay always obeyed a pseudo -first-order reaction. The uric acid contained in the synthetic urine was completely oxidized, whereas a partial destruction was found for the major component urea and a smaller destruction of creatinine. A moderate TOC reduction slightly >= 40% was determined at pH 3.0 and 7.0 for j = 100 mA cm-2. The main nitrogenated species released was NH3 and small contents of residual free chlorine were finally detected. The present study reveals a good oxidation power of the ECO process with a BDD anode to remediate synthetic urine contaminated with CIP.

TI Role of zeolite encapsulated Cu(II) complexes in electron transfer as
   well as peroxy radical intermediates formation during oxidation of
   thioanisole
SO JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB Zeolite encapsulated host-guest complexes [CuL(NO3)@11], and [CuL2@Y] (where, HL is 3-[(3-dimethyla mino-2,2-dimethyl-propylimino)-methyl]-naphthalen-2-ol) have been synthesized and characterized by XRD, FTIR, Raman, TEM, XPS, UV-DRS, BET, EXAFS, and EPR spectroscopy. These complexes used as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of thioanisole, diphenyl sulfide, and 2-phenyl thioanisole to produce its sulfoxides analogues.H2O2 shows superior conversion efficiency and product selectivity over other common oxidants, viz tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) and di-tertbutyl hydroperoxide (DTBP). Formation of thermally stable copper hydroperoxo intermediate, which is to be believed as rate determining step in past few years, has been well proven. Besides that, for the first time, we have established that the oxidation process is not only going through by the generation of Cu (II)-OOH species but there is a considerable role of electron transfer (ET) mechanism also. Further, better TON value and recyclability make the encapsuled heterogeneous complexes more useful than that of homogeneous analogues. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Low temperature synthesis of nano-crystalline h-boron nitride from boric
   acid/urea precursors
SO JOURNAL OF CERAMIC PROCESSING RESEARCH
AB Nano-crystalline hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) have promised a broad range of interesting applications due to its unique characteristics. In this work, nano-structured h-BN has synthesized by a low temperature-one step reaction of completely dissolved solution of commercial and low cost boric acid and urea fertilizer. Effect of different concentrations of urea, reaction atmosphere (air-N-2) and firing temperature (600, 800 degrees C) on the production of h-BN and type of yield were investigated. The formation of hexagonal boron nitride was proved from the binding energy for boron and nitrogen obtained from the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). The structural phase of the product was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) has revealed the nano structure nature of the synthesized boron nitride. The results indicated that, nano-crystalline h-BN with a crystallite size of approximate to 4.5 nm has formed at low temperature of 800 degrees C. Moreover, a good thermal stability and oxidation resistance of h-BN can be synthesized with low cost and at low temperature in the nanoscale and has high potential to be used in advanced applications.

The catalyst demonstrated stable UOR and HER activity during long-term operations due to the abundant active sites and oxygen vacancies. The catalyst required applied potentials of 1.52 and -0.185 V to yield 100 mA cm(-2) for the UOR and HER, respectively. Moreover, when used as both the cathode and anode, the electrolyzer required a working voltage of 1.68 V to yield 100 mA cm(-2) for urea-assisted hydrogen production.

TI Manipulating Trimetal Catalytic Activities for Efficient Urea
   Electrooxidation-Coupled Hydrogen Production at Ampere-Level Current
   Densities
SO ACS NANO
AB Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in conjunction with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) offers a feasible and environmentally friendly approach for handling urea-rich wastewater and generating energy-saving hydrogen. However, the deactivation and detachment of active sites in powder electrocatalysts reported hitherto present significant challenges to achieving high efficiency and sustainability in energy-saving hydrogen production. Herein, a self-supported bimetallic nickel manganese metal-organic framework (NiMn-MOF) nanosheet and its derived heterostructure composed of NiMn-MOF decorated with ultrafine Pt nanocrystals (PtNC/NiMn-MOF) are rationally designed. By leveraging the synergistic effect of Mn and Ni, along with the strong electronic interaction between NiMn-MOF and PtNC at the interface, the optimized catalysts (NiMn-MOF and PtNC/NiMn-MOF) exhibit substantially reduced potentials of 1.459 and -0.129 V to reach 1000 mA cm-2 during the UOR and HER. Theoretical calculations confirm that Mn-doping and the heterointerface between NiMn-MOF and Pt nanocrystals regulate the d-band center of the catalyst, which in turn enhances electron transfer and facilitates charge redistribution. This manipulation optimizes the adsorption/desorption energies of the reactants and intermediates in both the HER and UOR, thereby significantly reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) and enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the urea degradation rates of PtNC/NiMn-MOF (96.1%) and NiMn-MOF (90.3%) are significantly higher than those of Ni-MOF and the most reported advanced catalysts. This work provides valuable insights for designing catalysts applicable to urea-rich wastewater treatment and energy-saving hydrogen production.

TI Levels of renalase and advanced oxidation protein products with regard
   to catecholamines in haemodialysed patients
SO ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Introduction. The main mediators of the sympathetic nervous system in the effectors part are catecholamines (CA). An increased sympathetic nerve activity observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD), is due to a raised level of CA in plasma. Renalase is a protein secreted by the kidneys, composed of 342 amino acids, which is able to metabolize the circulating CA and possibly play an important role in the regulation of sympathetic tone and blood pressure. Also, oxidative stress, defined as a disruption of the equilibrium between the generation of oxidants, is a crucial factor in the development of the inflammatory syndrome associated with CKD. The advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) represent exquisite markers of phagocyte-derived oxidative stress.
   Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate the concentration of renalase and explore the associations between AOPP with regards to CA in haemodialysis (HD) patients.
   Materials and Method. The study was conducted among 50 residents of the municipality and neighbouring villages in the province of Lublin, central-eastern Poland.
   Results. In the studied patients, it was found that an average concentration of renalase was 44.8 +/- 6.5 mu g/mL, whereas of AOPP plasma levels -57.5 +/- 21.5 mu mol/L. The results demonstrated the correlation between levels of renalase and AOPP in the HD patients. Indeed, elevated levels of renalase and AOPP in HD may be due to the presence of uremic toxins in blood. The concentration of urea affects the plasma concentrations of AOPP and renalase causing a direct relationship between renalase and AOPP. However, there is no clear relationship between renalase and circulating catecholamines in HD patients.

TI Melatonin attenuates cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury in mice:
   Involvement of PPARα and fatty acid oxidation
SO FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB The present study focused on the protective effects of melatonin against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury in mice and its possible mechanism of action in relation to the major regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), peroxidase proliferative receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). The experiment consisted of the following four groups: vehicle control, cisplatin (15 mg/kg), cisplatin & melatonin (20 mg/kg/day), and melatonin (20 mg/kg/day). Concomitant administration of melatonin significantly ameliorated cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury in mice by decreasing serum levels of triglyceride, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, reducing the number and size of lipid droplets in tubular epithelial cells, and decreasing the incidence of histopathological changes including tubular cell apoptosis. Moreover, melatonin administration protected kidney tissue by significantly upregulating the levels of PPAR alpha reduced by cisplatin injection, resulting in increased FAO pathway-associated genes (PGC-1a, Acadm, Acat1, Acsm2, Acsm3, Bdh2, Echs and Pecr) as well as reducing protein levels of caspase-3,-9 and Bax. Melatonin not only partially modulated FAO via PPAR alpha signaling, but also decreased cisplatin-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the caspase-3,-9 and Bax pathways. Our findings suggest that melatonin prevents cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury in mice, possibly by upregulating the expression of PPAR alpha, resulting in enhanced FAO and anti-apoptotic properties.

TI Copper based catalysts for the selective ammonia oxidation into nitrogen
   and water vapour-Recent trends and open challenges
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB More restrictive standards of Euro VI concerning nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO, NO2) emissions necessitate an enhanced urea injection, while generating a higher ammonia slip, which is also precisely limited. For this reason, ammonia slip catalysts (ASC) are an essential part of efficient aftertreatment systems. Currently, supported noble metal catalysts are applied but possess limited selectivity to nitrogen. Copper based catalysts present a promising alternative for the selective catalytic ammonia oxidation into nitrogen and water vapour (NH3-SCO). This review article focusses on NH3-SCO as appropriate solution to abate unreacted ammonia particularly after the selective catalytic reduction of NO with ammonia (NH3-SCR, DeNO(x)). A brief overview of potential catalyst systems is provided, followed by a comprehensive discussion of copper based catalysts. Potential material classes including oxides, exchanged zeolites, modified clays or mixed forms are described systematically. The review focusses on structure-performance correlations covering copper loading, redox properties of CuO species and available acid sites of the catalysts. Another emphasis concerns the influence of the feed composition on the catalytic performance including the content of oxygen and water vapour or sulphur oxide in the feed. Finally, the proposed i-SCR mechanism over copper based catalysts, including bimetallic systems, is described and critically reviewed followed by general conclusions together with a discussion of promising research directions.

TI Au Clusters Supported on Defect-Rich Ni-Ti Oxides Derived from Ultrafine
   Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) for CO Oxidation at Ambient Temperature
SO CATALYSTS
AB Ultrafine layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have abundant hydroxy groups at their edge sites, serving as anchor sites for metal NPs. Furthermore, transformation of ultrafine LDHs into mixed metal oxides (MMOs) generates abundant oxygen vacancies, which are advantageous for O-2 activation during Au-catalyzed CO oxidation. We used ultrafine Ni-Ti LDHs with low crystallinity or Ni-Ti MMOs supported on SiO2 onto which Au NPs were deposited by deposition-precipitation (DP) and DP-urea (DPU). The catalytic activity of the Au catalysts was significantly affected by the preparation method, with the highest activity obtained by depositing Au onto LDH/SiO2 by DPU, followed by transformation of LDH to MMO (Au/Ni-Ti MMO/SiO2 (LDH-DPU)). The presence of Au on LDHs affected the transformation of LDHs into MMOs, resulting in LDH-DPU having the greatest number of oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 domain in MMOs. Consequently, the adsorbed or the lattice oxygen on the surface of LDH-DPU can be easily utilized for CO oxidation at low temperatures. Moreover, the catalytic activity of LDH-DPU increased with water vapor concentration up to 100% relative humidity at room temperature, suggesting the potential of Au/Ni-Ti MMO/SiO2 as an air purification catalyst.

TI The significant roles of Nb and Mo on enhancement of high temperature
   urea corrosion resistance in ferritic stainless steel
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB The significant roles of Nb and Mo on enhancing high temperature urea corrosion (HTUC) resistance of ferritic stainless steels applied in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system of commercial vehicle were investigated. By slightly increasing of Nb or Mo, the reactivation rate (Ra) of ferritic stainless steels was significantly reduced, indicating an improvement in HTUC resistance. High temperature nitriding induced by the decomposition of urea resulted in precipitation of chromium nitride particles, which caused chromium depletion in the matrix and resultant deterioration of corrosion resistance. Moreover, the high temperature oxidation accompanied by thermal fatigue further accelerates the formation and exfoliation of oxide layer, showing detrimental consequences on service life of materials for commercial vehicle.

TI Electrodeposition of NiCo on stainless steel substrate using deep
   eutectic solvent for efficient hydrogen evolution and methanol oxidation
   reactions
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The electrodeposition of NiCo on a stainless-steel substrate using Deep eutectic solvent (DES) was carried out using constant current methods. A 1:2 mol ratio of ChCl (Choline chloride) and crystalline urea was used to prepare DES. The XRD analysis of the fabricated NiCo@SS showed a highly crystalline nature, and the SEM image revealed the fabricated electrode surface morphology. The composition and oxidation state of the deposited material were confirmed by EDAX and XPS techniques. The prepared electrodes were subjected to LSV and CV studies with 1 M KOH using a three-electrode system to analyse its catalytic ability in the Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Among all the deposited electrocatalysts, NiCo@SS demonstrated the highest catalytic activity and excellent stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), achieving an overpotential of 257 mV at a current density of 100 mA/cm2. Additionally, NiCo@SS exhibited a remarkable current density of 240 mA at a potential of 0.8 V towards the MOR. The synthesized NiCo@SS possessed excellent low overpotential, low charge transfer resistance, high current density, and large surface area. The explored catalyst of NiCo@SS was examined with different concentrations of methanol using the CV technique. Finally, the stability of NiCo@SS, as examined by chronoamperometry and LSV with 3000 cycles, revealed it to be a robust, stable catalyst towards HER and OER.

TI Bimetallic Ni-Co/SBA-15 catalysts prepared by urea co-precipitation for
   dry reforming of methane
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB A series of NixCo(10-x)/SBA-15 catalysts with constant metal loading (10 wt%) and different Co/Ni mass ratios (0/ 10-10/0) were prepared by urea co-precipitation and applied to the dry reforming of methane (DRM). The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized in detail by various techniques (N-2 physisorption, H-2 chemisorption, XRD, TPR, ICP-OES, TGA, HRTEM and)(PS), revealing that Ni and Co particles were embedded into the channel of SBA-15 and Ni was alloyed with Co. In addition, the bimetallic catalysts with a Co/Ni ratio (R-Co/Ni) lower than 1 had relatively high metal dispersion (ca. 17-20%) and small metal particle sizes (ca. 4-5 nm). The DRM activity and stability of NixCo(10-x)/SBA-15 in terms of coke- and sintering-resistance were systematically examined and compared, which showed that the activity and stability of the catalysts depended strongly on the metal particle size, indicating the structure-sensitive character of the DRM reaction. Compared to monometallic Ni-10/SBA-15 and Co-10/SBA-15, bimetallic NixCo(10-x)/SBA-15 with R-Co/Ni < 1 possessed improved activity and stability, which was mainly attributed to the small metal particle size, the synergetic effect of Co and Ni as well as the confinement effect of SBA-15 mesoporous channels. In particular, Ni9Co1/SBA-15 exhibited the highest activity, stability and H-2/CO molar ratio (close to 1) during 50 h of operation at a gas hourly space velocity of 72000 mL/(g(cat) h) under 973 and 1073 K. Moreover, no coke deposition occurred on the catalyst, with only slight metal particle size growth to around 5 nm, indicating excellent coke- and sintering-resistance.

TI Crystalline/amorphous c-NiMo/a-NiMoOx nanoarrays for
   urea-assisted energy-saving H2 production in alkaline
   seawater
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB Electrocatalytic seawater splitting is regarded as the most effective method for producing green hydrogen (H2), but it faces issues of high energy consumption and harmful chlorine evolution side reactions. Replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) would enable energy-saving and chlorine-free H2 production. Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D) structured electrocatalyst (c-MoNi/a-NiMoOx) with crystalline MoNi alloy clusters coupled with amorphous NiMoOx nanowires is reported. In the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, the electron redistribution at the crystalline/amorphous interface could effectively regulate the electronic structure, thereby optimizing the Gibbs free energy of water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption. In the UOR process, c-MoNi/a-NiMoOx undergoes surface reconstruction to form highly active beta-NiMoOOH. The incorporation of Mo lowers the activation energy barrier of the rate-determining step, thus facilitating the progression of the multi-step UOR process. Excitingly, the urea-assisted seawater electrolysis based on c-MoNi/a-NiMoOx requires an ultralow voltage of 1.68 V to deliver 500 mA cm-2, and displays distinguished long-term stability to keep above 100 mA cm-2 for 300 h. This work may show practical impact on designing efficient electrocatalysts for combing seawater splitting with urea purification.

TI Novel Ce-modified cobalt catalysts supported over
   a-Al2O3 open cell foams for lean methane oxidation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB A series of CeO2-modified Co3O4 catalysts supported over alpha-Al2O3 foams was prepared by solution combustion synthesis and examined for the lean methane oxidation. Two different fuels were used namely, urea and glycine, with varying fuel/oxidiser (phi) ratio. The catalysts were characterised by SEM-EDX, STEM-HAADF coupled to EDX mapping, ICP-AES, WDXRF, N-2 physisorption, XRD, HRTEM, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, H-2-TPR and CH4-TPRe, and their activity in the abatement of methane was analysed under realistic conditions. The use of glycine produced catalysts with significantly better morphological and structural properties. Likewise, a favoured insertion of cerium cations into the Co3O4 spinel lattice was observed, which caused a significant distortion of the spinel structure, thereby leading to a higher amount of mobile oxygen species capable of oxidising methane. These beneficial structural alterations were more pronounced with higher phi ratios.

TI Hetero Diels-Alder Reactions with a Dicationic Urea Azine Derived Azo
   Dienophile and Their Use for the Synthesis of an Electron-Rich Pentacene
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Herein, the first hetero Diels-Alder (DA) reactions with a stable, dicationic urea azine derived azo dienophile, synthesized by two-electron oxidation of a neutral urea azine are reported. Several charged DA products were synthesized in good yield and fully characterized. The DA adduct of anthracene is in thermal equilibrium with the reactants at room temperature, and the reaction enthalpy and entropy were determined from the temperature-dependent equilibrium constant. Furthermore, base addition to solutions of the pentacene DA product led to deprotonation, cleavage of the N-N bond, and formation of an electron-rich 6,13-bisguanidinyl-substituted pentacene. The redox and optical properties of this new pentacene derivative were studied. Furthermore, the dication resulting from its two-electron oxidation was synthesized and fully characterized. The results disclose a new elegant route to electron-rich pentacene derivatives.

TI Insights into periodate oxidation of antibiotics mediated by
   visible-light-induced polymeric carbon nitride: Performance and
   mechanism
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Periodate (PI)-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have drawn growing attention in an effort to alleviate pollutants issues in the aqueous environment. Different from previous use of ultraviolet light or metal catalysts, this study proposes a novel system for the visible-light-assisted activation of PI via metal-free polymeric carbon nitride (CN). The best catalytic effect was achieved by CN synthesized from urea (UCN). Effective charge separation predominately caused kinetic increase in photocatalytic degradation, where interfacial electron transfer in UCN/PI/Vis system occurred in the synergistic process. UCN generated photogenerated electrons-hole under visible light irradiation. The organic pollutant acted as an electron donor. PI could effectively act as an electron capture agent and inhibit the complexation of charge carriers. The combination of PI-based AOP and photo-catalysis greatly increased the degradation of pollutants through photocatalysis, achieving the effect of 1 + 1 > 2. The tetracycline (TC) effectively underwent nearly 100 % removal within 10 min and the corresponding kobs attained 0.40839 min(-1). Besides, outstanding catalytic performance in a broad range of pH (2.99-11.01) was confirmed. Meanwhile, the UCN/PI/Vis system demonstrated favorable immunity to common wastewater components, good stability, and reusability. The prominent active species for TC degradation were singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and iodate radical (IO3 center dot, IO4 center dot), followed by superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)). This study establishes a precedent for visible-light-induced activation of PI by UCN, interfacial electron transfer occurs in a synergistic process, and greatly accelerated photocatalytic oxidation is accomplished with PI acting as an electron scavenger.

AB Amidst the concurrent challenges posed by the energy crisis and environmental pollution, the direct liquid fuel cell (DLFC) emerges as a pivotal clean and renewable energy source, significantly advancing sustainable energy production and consumption systems. In this regard, the commercialization of the direct liquid fuel cell hinges on the development and fabrication of cost-effective electrocatalysts with high activity and robust durability. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have made significant advancements in recent years as electrocatalyst candidates, offering a large surface area, distinctive 2D layered structure, numerous exposed active sites, and robust chemical stability. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent advancements in the controlled fabrication of nanoarchitectures based on 2D materials using various synthetic methods. Furthermore, we examine their application and the relationship between structure and electrochemical performance in the electro-oxidation of small molecules used in DLFC, including methanol oxidation reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, formic acid oxidation reaction, hydrazine oxidation reaction, and urea oxidation reaction. Finally, we present future perspectives that address the forthcoming challenges and opportunities within this emerging domain.

SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB The overall energy efficiency of electrochemical systems is significantly reduced by the conventional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is feasible to improve energy efficiency by replacing the OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which has a lower thermodynamic potential. An organic-inorganic hybrid polyoxoniobate decorated by a Co(iii)-amine complex, Na-4(H2O)(15)[Co(en)(3)](2){[Co(en)(Nb6O19)](2)}.34H(2)O (Co2Nb6, en = ethylenediamine) with distinct physicochemical characteristics and well-defined single-crystal structure is reported. The structure of Co2Nb6 contains Lindqvist {[Co(en)(Nb6O19)](2)}(10-) dimer and free [Co(en)(3)](3+) complexes. Co2Nb6 exhibits remarkable catalytic activity for the UOR after being firmly attached to the surface of acetylene black by polyethyleneimine (PEI). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of performing the electrocatalytic UOR based on Lindqvist polyoxoniobate clusters, which will pave the path for innovative concepts in the development of POM-based electrocatalysts.

   MIXED OXIDES CATALYSTS
SO CHEMICAL INDUSTRY & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING QUARTERLY
AB The successful synthesis of AMn(2)O(4) (A = Co, Cu, and Ni) spinels via solution combustion was achieved in less time than other methods. All catalysts with the same fuel/nitrate ratio were used to oxidize toluene, and the relationship between their properties and activities was investigated. Among all, nickel manganite exhibited the most promising activity, and by changing the fuel/nitrate ratio, it was sought to obtain the most appropriate structure for the reaction studied. Physico-chemical analysis was used to define the characteristics of the synthesized catalysts. The results showed the successful synthesis of spinels and indicated that other materials peaks (single oxide phases) exist in the catalyst structure. BET-BJH analyses reveal the mesoporous structures and, given the limitations of the equipment, were all classified as less than 10 m(2)/g. The SEM images evidence the influence of the urea content used. The particle size increases at higher fuel/nitrate ratios. Samples of NiMn1.67 and NiMn2.08 showed larger and denser, sparsely dispersed clusters. Simultaneously considering reactor analysis and test results, it was found that the synthesized catalyst with a fuel/nitrate ratio of 0.5 has the best performance on toluene oxidation.

TI A comparison between high temperature catalytic and persulfate oxidation
   for the determination of total dissolved nitrogen in natural waters
SO ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
AB Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) is an important parameter for assessing the nutrient cycling and status of natural waters. The accurate determination of TDN in natural waters is essential for assessing its contents and distinguishing different forms of nitrogen in the water. The TDN in various systems has been largely documented, and the concentrations of TDN are usually obtained using high-temperature catalytic ( HTC) or persulfate oxidation (PO). However, the accuracy of these methods and their suitability for all types of natural waters are still unclear. To explore both methods in-depth, assorted samples were tested, including eight solutions composed of nitrogen-containing compounds (3 dissolved inorganic nitrogen fractions: NO3-, NO2 and NH4I; 5 organic compounds: EDTA-2Na, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, amino acids, and urea) and 105 natural waters which were collected from an open ocean (Northwest Pacific Ocean, 28), a marginal sea (Yellow Sea, 34), an estuary (Huanghe River mouth, 31), rivers (Huanghe River, 4; Licun River, 4), and precipitations (4 samples). The results showed that heterocycles and molecular dimensions had certain effects on the oxidation efficiency of the PO method but had little effect on HTC. There was no significant difference between the two methods for natural waters, but HTC was more suitable for deep-sea samples with low TDN concentrations (less than 10 mu mol/L) and low organic activity. Overall, HTC has a relatively simple measurement process, a high degree of automation, and low error. Therefore, HTC can be recommended to determine the TDN of samples in freshwater and seawater.

TI Synthesis of bimetallic AuPt/CeO2 catalysts and their
   comparative study in CO oxidation under different reaction conditions
SO REACTION KINETICS MECHANISMS AND CATALYSIS
AB In the present work, ceria-supported Au-Pt catalyst with metal ratio 3:2 was prepared using a single-source precursor concept. The double complex salt [AuEn(2)](2)[Pt(NO2)(4)](3)6H(2)O was used as such precursor. CeO2 of unique morphology with developed surface area (120m(2)/g) obtained by urea precipitation technique was used as a support. According to XRD data, size of the alloyed Au-Pt particles was estimated to be less than 3nm. It was shown that bimetallic Au-Pt system intensifies release of oxygen from the CeO2 lattice. The 0.5%Au2Pt3/CeO2 catalyst was comparatively studied in low temperature CO oxidation (simplified model reaction mixture) and under prompt thermal aging conditions (complex reaction mixture) with regard to monometallic reference samples 0.2%Au/CeO2 and 0.3%Pt/CeO2. The catalytic performance of the samples was found to be significantly dependent on the reaction and pre-treatment conditions. In the case of the bimetallic catalyst, reversible redistribution and enrichment of the nanoparticle surface with Pt or Au were shown to be the key factor defining the activity.

TI Single and dual-atom catalysts towards electrosynthesis of ammonia and
   urea: a review
SO NANOSCALE
AB Ammonia and urea represent two important chemicals that have contributed to the rapid development of humanity. However, their industrial production requires harsh conditions, consuming excessive energy and resulting in significant greenhouse gas emission. Therefore, there is growing interest in the electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia and urea as it can be carried out under ambient conditions. Recently, atomic catalysts (ACs) have gained increased attention for their superior catalytic properties, being able to outperform their micro and nano counterparts. This review examines the advantages and disadvantages of ACs and summarises the advancement of ACs in the electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia and urea. The focus is on two types of AC - single-atom catalysts (SACs) and diatom catalysts (DACs). SACs offer various advantages, including the 100% atom utilization that allows for low material mass loading, suppression of competitive reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and alternative reaction pathways allowing for efficient synthesis of ammonia and urea. DACs inherit these advantages, possessing further benefits of synergistic effects between the two catalytic centers at close proximity, particularly matching the N 00000000000000000 00000000000000000 00000000000000000 01111111111111110 00000000000000000 01111111111111110 00000000000000000 01111111111111110 00000000000000000 00000000000000000 00000000000000000 N bond for N2 reduction and boosting C-N coupling for urea synthesis. DACs also possess the ability to break the linear scaling relation of adsorption energy of reactants and intermediates, allowing for tuning of intermediate adsorption energies. Finally, possible future research directions using ACs are proposed.
   Illustration of atomic catalysts in five different reactions: nitrogen reduction, nitrate reduction, nitrite reduction, nitric oxide reduction and urea synthesis. Advantages of diatom catalysts include those of single atom catalysts.

TI Orange Zn-Al-O-N Powder Active for Photocatalytic Water Reduction and
   Oxidation Synthesized from a Zn-Al Layered Double Hydroxide Using Urea
   as the Nitriding Agent
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB The development of colored inorganic powders that are inexpensive, chemically stable, and nontoxic is important for applications such as heterogeneous photocatalysts and pigments. Here, we show that a ZnO-based orange powder can be synthesized through thermal conversion of a two-dimensional Zn-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) in the presence of urea as a nitriding agent, thereby avoiding the use of expensive, poisonous NH3 gas. Heating a mixture of Zn-Al LDH and urea under a flow of N-2 at 773 K yielded N-doped ZnO as the main crystalline phase, along with a small amount of Zn(CN2). At temperatures greater than 873 K, N-doped ZnO with deep-orange coloration began to appear as the main phase, accompanied by a small amount of gamma-AlON. The orange color, which was attributed to the formation of a N-doped ZnO phase, became more prominent with increasing temperature up to 973 K. At temperatures greater than 973 K, an optically transparent ZnAl2O4 phase was dominant, resulting in a loss of the orange coloration. Nitridation of Zn-5(OH)(6)(CO3)(2) and gamma-AlOOH, which are analogous layered compounds prepared in a manner similar to that of Zn-Al LDH, with urea at 973 K did not yield an orange product. Under visible light, the Zn-Al-O-N powder produced H-2 from aqueous methanol solution and O-2 gas from a silver nitrate solution, with apparent quantum yields of 0.26 and 1.8% at 420 nm, respectively. This work highlights that the use of base metal-based LDH and an inexpensive solid nitrogen source may provide a unique platform for synthesizing a new photocatalyst material, which is unattainable with the previous method using toxic ammonia gas.

TI In situ Carbon Modification of g-C3N4 from
   Urea co-Crystal with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity Towards
   Degradation of Organic Dyes Under Visible Light
SO CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN CHINESE UNIVERSITIES
AB An in situ strategy was introduced for synthesizing carbon modified graphitic carbon nitride(g-C3N4) by using urea/4-aminobenzoic acid(PABA) co-crystal(PABA@Urea) as precursor materials. Via co-calcination of the PABA co-former and the urea in PABA@Urea co-crystals, C guest species were generated and compounded into g-C3N4 matrix in situ by replacing the lattice N of the carbon nitride and forming carbon dots onto its layer surface. The carbon modification dramatically enhanced visible-light harvesting and charge carrier separation. Therefore, visible light photo-catalytic oxidation of methylene blue(MB) pollution in water over the carbon modified g-C3N4 (C/g-C3N4) was notably improved. Up to 99% of methylene blue(MB) was eliminated within 60 min by the optimal sample prepared from the PABA@Urea co-crystal with a PABA content of 0.1%(mass ratio), faster than the degradation rate over bare g-C3N4. The present study demonstrates a new way to boost up the photocatalysis performance of g-C3N4, which holds great potential concerning the degradation of organic dyes from water.

TI N-Pyridylureas as Masked Isocyanates Fort the Late-Stage
   Diversification of Pyridine-N-Oxides
SO CHEMISTRYSELECT
AB A new method for the synthesis of pyridine- and quinoline-N-oxides containing a ureido or carbamoyl fragment in position 2 has been developed. This method concluded in the oxidation of relatively readily available substituted N,N-dimethyl-N '-(pyridine-2-yl)ureas to the corresponding N-oxides, followed by modification of the dimethylureide moiety. Being heated to 90 degrees C in the presence of amines in a solution of DMF or chlorobenzene, N-oxide of N,N-dimethyl-N '-(pyridine-2-yl)urea undergoes a transamination reaction without loss of the N-oxide function. This produces N-oxides of N-alkyl/aryl-N'-(pyridine-2-yl)ureas in 24-99 % yields, (about 30 examples). Values of the NH protons chemical shifts are a good criterion for the selectivity of the reaction. The reaction is also applicable to N-oxides of ureas substituted in the pyridine ring and to the quinoline congener. N-Oxides of pyridine/quinoline-containing carbamates can be similarly prepared by heating N-oxides of N,N-dimethyl-N '-(pyridine-2-yl)/(quinoline-2-yl)-urea in an appropriate alcohol solution at 120 degrees C.

TI Preparation and NOx-assisted soot oxidation activity
   of a CuO-CeO2 mixed oxide catalyst
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB A CuO-CeO2 mixed oxide catalyst is synthesized via the urea-nitrate combustion method. The catalytic activity in the reaction of NOR-assisted soot oxidation is evaluated with a TG/DTG technique. The sample Cu1Ce9 possesses the lowest temperature (T-m =383 degrees C) of the maximum soot oxidation rate and the largest specific surface area (65.1 m(2)/g) among the samples examined. The XRD results show that the fluorite-type CeO2 exists in all the samples forming a solid solution with CuO. Crystalline copper oxide phases are not detectable if the Cu/(Cu+Ce) atomic ratio is lower than 0.25. The activity and NOx-TPD results prove that NO2 formed from NO and the nitrate species play crucial roles for soot oxidation in NOx atmosphere. Kinetic parameters, such as the activation energy and reaction order, corresponding to the oxidation of soot are calculated with a differential method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Oxovanadium and copper complexes of new unsymmetrically tetradentate
   ligands: X- ray structure, theoretical and NLO properties, catalytic
   oxidation and bromoperoxidase activities
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB A series of mononuclear oxovanadium VOLBz, VOLT and copper CuLBz, CuLT complexes containing unsymmetrical tetradentate Schiff base ligands were synthesized and fully characterized by conventional spectroscopic techniques such as FT-IR, UV-vis, 1HNMR and mass spectrometry (MS). Crystal structure data of CuLT, solved by X-ray diffraction, shows a monoclinic system with Cc space group and Z = 4 molecules per unit cell. The central copper ion adopts a nearly ideal square planar coordination geometry. Cyclic voltammetry of oxovanadium and copper complexes revealed quasi reversible redox couples corresponding to VOIV/VOV and CuI/CuII redox processes, respectively. The quantum calculations, performed by DFT and TD-DFT theory at the M062X/6-311**G/ SDD level, agree well with the experimental data. The results show that the copper and the oxovanadium compounds have larger static and dynamic hyperpolarizability values than the urea. For instance, the & beta;0 value of H2LT is about 68 times larger than that of the urea. The results predict that the studied compounds have the ability to be excellent second and third-order NLO materials. The prepared complexes catalyzed effectively homogeneous oxidation reaction of cyclohexene in the presence of H2O2 as oxidant. Higher conversion of 98% is attained using CuLBz as catalyst. The bromoperoxidase activity is explored in the oxidative bromination of phenol red as a trap employing the studied complexes which can be considered as potential functional models of bromoperoxidase, CuLBz catalyst exhibits the better catalytic activity, the reaction rate constant k is equal to 2.203x105 (mol L-1)-2s-1.

TI Degradation of 4-nitrophenol by electrocatalysis and advanced oxidation
   processes using Co3O4@C anode coupled with
   simultaneous CO2 reduction via SnO2/CC
   cathode
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB Herein, we prepared novel three-dimensional (3D) gear-shaped Co3O4@C (Co3O4 modified by amorphous carbon) and sheet-like SnO2/CC (SnO2 grow on the carbon cloth) as anode and cathode to achieve efficient removal of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in the presence of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and simultaneous electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, respectively. In this process, 4-NP was mineralized into CO2 by the Co3O4@C, and the generated CO2 was reduced into HCOOH by the sheet-like SnO2/CC cathode. Compared with the pure Co0.5 (Co3O4 was prepared using 0.5 g urea) with PMS (30 mg, 0.5 g/L), the degradation efficiency of 4-NP (60 mL, 10 mg/L) increased from 74.5%-85.1% in 60 min using the Co0.5 modified by amorphous carbon (Co0.5@C). Furthermore, when the voltage of 1.0 V was added in the anodic system of Co0.5@C with PMS (30 mg, 0.5 g/L), the degradation efficiency of 4-NP increased from 85.1%-99.1% when Pt was used as cathode. In the experiments of 4-NP degradation coupled with simultaneous electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the degradation efficiency of 4-NP was 99.0% in the anodic system of Co0.5@C with addition of PMS (30 mg, 0.5 g/L), while the Faraday efficiency (FE) of HCOOH was 24.1 % at voltage of -1.3 V using the SnO2/CC as cathode. The results showed that the anode of Co3O4 modified by amorphous carbon can markedly improve the degradation efficiency of 4-NP, while the cathode of SnO2/CC can greatly improve the FE and selectivity of CO2 reduction to HCOOH and the stability of cathode. Finally, the promotion mechanism was proposed to explain the degradation of organic pollutants and reduction of CO2 into HCOOH in the process of electrocatalysis coupled with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and simultaneous CO2 reduction.

TI Investigations on the decomposition of AdBlue urea in the liquid phase
   at low temperatures by an electrochemically induced pH shift
SO MONATSHEFTE FUR CHEMIE
AB Ammonia-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems are the most widely used technology for reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions from lean-burn engines such as diesel engines. However, at low exhaust temperatures, the SCR process is limited by difficulties in the decomposition of the ammonia precursor urea, which is carried on-board using an aqueous solution "AdBlue". In this study, the decomposition of AdBlue urea induced by electrical current and the resulting associated pH shifts were investigated in a divided cell configuration in the liquid phase. The decomposition was found to be favored in both electrochemical compartments, anodic and cathodic, at temperatures of 60-80 degrees C compared to a reference without electrochemical treatment. In addition to the determination of ammonia contents using an ammonia sensor, IC/HPLC analyses were carried out for each sample. Different side products such as biuret, nitrate, cyanuric acid, ammelide, and others were formed. In the anodic compartment, nitrate formation could be observed due to oxidation of ammonia at the electrode surface.

TI Unified and green oxidation of amides and aldehydes for the Hofmann and
   Curtius rearrangements
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB The Hofmann and Curtius rearrangements have been widely used in organic synthesis and developed for the industrial production (5-100 kg) of pharmaceutically relevant amines/amides. However, the existing use of a stoichiometric organic oxidant [(diacetoxyiodo)benzene or trichloroisocyanuric acid for the Hofmann rearrangement] for amides or an activating reagent (diphenylphosphoryl azide for the Curtius rearrangement) for carboxylic acids is environmentally unfriendly and economically less attractive. Herein, we report the first green oxidation of amides and aldehydes with oxone and halide (and NaN3) to generate N-halo amides and acyl azides, respectively, both of which rearrange into the common isocyanate intermediates and subsequently produce stable carbamates or ureas (the Hofmann and Curtius rearrangements) when trapped with alcohols or amines. This unified green approach is highly efficient as demonstrated by more than 30 examples for each rearrangement. Importantly, this approach generates inorganic nontoxic K2SO4 as the only byproduct, which is advantageous over the existing methods that produced stoichiometric, toxic, and organic iodobenzene, and chloro-isocyanuric acid, or diphenylphosphoric acid. Notably, three urea-based drugs and eight chiral urea catalysts were efficiently synthesized from corresponding aldehydes by this green oxidative Curtius rearrangement. This green oxidative approach for the Hofmann and Curtius rearrangements is expected to find wide applications in organic synthesis and process chemistry.
   The oxone-halide green oxidation system is extended to the oxidation of primary amides and aromatic aldehydes (with sodium azide) to generate N-haloamide and acyl azides, respectively, for subsequent Hofmann and Curtius rearrangements.

TI Synthesis of a CeO2/Co3O4 catalyst with
   a remarkable performance for the soot oxidation reaction
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A highly active catalyst based on two metal oxides, CeO2/Co3O4, for the low temperature soot oxidation at low temperatures is reported. This catalyst was produced by depositing cobalt oxide by the method of deposition-precipitation with urea onto CeO2 microstructures obtained by the hydrothermal method using urea and citric acid as precipitating agents. Catalytic experiments were performed by temperature programmed combustion, in a fixed-bed microreactor, under loose and tight contact conditions, using Printex-U (Evonik) as the model soot. The results showed that the CeO2/Co3O4 material presented an enhanced activity for the soot oxidation reaction (50% soot conversion at 287 degrees C) compared with CeO2 (50% soot conversion at 337 degrees C) and Co3O4 (50% soot conversion at 360 degrees C) catalysts separately. The catalytic activity for the CeO2/Co3O4 catalyst is higher than the ones reported for Ce-Co based catalysts, tested under similar conditions, for soot oxidation (reduced by 46 degrees C the lowest temperature reached for the 50% soot conversion).

TI pH-modulated aggregation-induced emission of Au/Cu nanoclusters and its
   application to the determination of urea and dissolved ammonia
SO MICROCHIMICA ACTA
AB A fluorescence platform is designed based on aggregation-induced emission of Au/Cu nanoclusters (Au/Cu NCs) driven by pH value. When pH increases from 6.0 to 7.0, Au/Cu NCs change from aggregation to dispersion, accompanied by the oxidation of Cu cores. Under the catalysis of urease, urea is hydrolysed to release ammonia, which further undergoes a hydrolysis reaction to produce OH-, causing the pH to increase. The fluorescence of Au/Cu NCs quenches linearly at 590 nm with the excitation wavelength at 320 nm when the concentration of urea varies from 5.0 to 100 mu M. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of urea are 2.23 and 7.45 mu M, respectively. Combined with headspace single-drop microextraction technology, Au/Cu NCs are employed to monitor dissolved ammonia with low-cost and simple operation. The linear range of dissolved ammonia is from 20 to 300 mu M. The LOD and LOQ of dissolved ammonia are 7.04 and 23.4 mu M, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values of the intra-day and inter-day precision of urea are 2.4-3.0% and 3.0-3.7%, respectively, and those of dissolved ammonia are in the range 3.4-5.1% (intra-day precision) and 4.2-5.8% (inter-day precision). No interferences have been indentified in the determination of urea and dissolved ammonia. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to determine urea in human urine samples and dissolved ammonia in water samples with satisfactory results.

TI Accelerating the reaction kinetics of
   Ni1-xO/Ni(OH)2/NF by defect engineering for
   urea-assisted water splitting
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Developing electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in the field of sustainable hydrogen production through urea-assisted water splitting remains challenging. Here, Ni1-xO/Ni(OH)(2) supported on nickel foam (Ni1-xO/Ni(OH)(2)/NF) is prepared via a defect engineering strategy by combining Zn doping and acid etching. The doped Zn species are partially removed, facilitating the formation of NiOOH during acid etching. Residual Zn species modulate the electronic structure of nickel sites, which intrinsically accelerate the reaction kinetics of Ni1-xO/Ni(OH)(2)/NF. Ni1-xO/Ni(OH)(2)/NF exhibits excellent performance for the UOR with a low potential of 1.346 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode to attain 100 mA cm(-2), fast reaction kinetics (18.7 mV dec(-1)), and excellent stability in an alkaline electrolyte. The enhanced reaction kinetics of Ni1-xO/Ni(OH)(2)/NF are clearly elucidated by operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy. Our study offers an effective approach for designing promising Ni-based UOR catalysts for the practical application of urea-assisted water splitting.

TI Rapid Two Surface Reconstructions of Ni/MnO Heterojunction for Superior
   Urea Electrolysis
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) emerges as a promising alternative anodic half-reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECRR) system. Herein, a Ni/MnO heterojunction with extraordinary UOR activity is synthesized on Ni foam. Ex situ/in situ characterization and theoretical calculation reveal that the outstanding UOR performance of Ni/MnO catalyst can be ascribed to two successive surface reconstructions. In the first and second surface reconstructions, Ni(OH)(2)/MnOOH and NiOOH/MnOOH heterojunctions are formed on the catalyst surface, and Mn and Ni sites serve as the active sites, respectively. The heterojunctions formed can enhance UOR activity by reducing the surface reconstruction potential and optimizing the adsorption energy of intermediates through electronic structure modulation and d-band center regulation. When employed as the UOR anode in the CO2 electrolyzer, it requires 375 mV less voltage at 10 mA cm(-2) than the OER, revealing the great potential of applying such Ni/MnO catalyst as the anodic UOR in an ECRR system for carbon neutrality.

TI Progress of electrocatalytic urea synthesis: strategic design, reactor
   engineering, mechanistic details and techno-commercial study
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB The industrial production of urea is a two step process, involving the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia followed by the reaction of ammonia with carbon dioxide, so the process is a capital expensive, energy consuming and complex synthesis technique with multiple cycles to increase the production efficiency. On the other hand, electrocatalytic C-N coupling reaction to specifically produce urea by simultaneous activation followed by co-reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen sources (N-2, NO2- or NO3-) under ambient conditions presents a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative route for urea production by a single step process. However, there are several challenges like adsorption capabilities of the reactants on the substrates followed by activation, vital interaction of the catalyst with intermediates, suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction and finally effective C-N bond formation to specifically produce urea. In this work we showcase the road map of the electrocatalytic green urea production, with concise yet precise discussion on potential electrocatalysts, electrochemical reactor engineering, mechanistic insight into urea synthesis, and a techno-commercial study and finally conclude with the future prospects of green urea production.

TI Recent progress with electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis in alkaline
   media for energy-saving hydrogen production
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The clean and renewable "hydrogen energy economy" era is coming. In this regard, the pathway for hydrogen production is of utmost importance. Recently, diligent urea (CO(NH2)(2)) electrolysis has been explored as a promising energy-saving avenue for sustainable hydrogen production in comparison with conventional water (H2O) electrolysis because of the low cell voltage, remediation of urea-rich wastewater and abundant electrocatalysts. Numerous non-precious materials (especially nickel-based ones) show potential as electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis in alkaline media and massive efforts are underway to improve the kinetics and thermodynamics. In this review, we firstly introduce the fundamentals of the energy-saving urea electrolysis system. Next, the recent advances with electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis are summarized. Then, the relationship between structure and activity is discussed. Finally, the remaining challenges and the future outlook are pointed out for the development of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts, new approaches for catalyst synthesis, solar-driven urea electrolysis and electrocatalytic mechanisms for Ni-free catalysts.

TI One-pot synthesis of N-doped graphene for metal-free advanced oxidation
   processes
SO CARBON
AB Recently, graphene and its derivatives as novel metal-free materials have attracted considerable attention in environmental remediation technologies. One of the barriers to practical applications is the mass production of high quality graphene-based catalysts. In this study, high-quality nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) nanomaterials were synthesized by controlled pyrolysis of a mixture of glucose, ferric chloride and urea. Glucose serves as a carbon precursor, urea as a nitrogen precursor, and hexahydrate ferric chloride as both a template and a catalyst. It was found that a low oxygen level of 2-4 at% and a nitrogen doping level of 0.5-1.8 at% were achieved at a moderate temperature. The obtained nitrogen-doped graphene was employed as a metal-free catalyst for efficient phenol degradation by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Kinetic studies showed that the phenol degradation facilitated by NG catalysis followed first-order reaction kinetics. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was performed to detect radical generation in order to reveal the mechanism of PMS activation processes and phenol degradation pathways on nanocarbons. It was found that both center dot OH and SO4 center dot- were produced in the catalytic oxidation processes and played significant roles in phenol oxidation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Urea and ammonium fluoride di-nitrogen and Cu & Fe bi-metal co-doped
   carbon felt as cathode for electro-Fenton degradation of norfloxacin:
   <SUP>1</SUP>O2-dominated oxidation pathway
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB Carbon materials co-doped with both metals and non-metallic heteroatoms have become an important research focus as catalysts for heterogeneous electro-Fenton technology and the removal of refractory organics. However, there is still a lack of in-depth studies on the doping of carbon with multiple nitrogen sources and their possible synergistic mechanism. In this study, two types of nitrogens (urea and ammonium fluoride) and Cu&Fe bimetal co-doped carbon felt electrodes (C-CuFe/N) were designed to explore the effect of co-doping on carbon. C-CuFe/N exhibited a high degradation efficiency towards norfloxacin (97.2%), low ion leaching and high cycling stability (90.3% after ten cycles), better than those shown by C-CuFe, C-CuFe/UN and C-CuFe/FN prepared with none or a single nitrogen dopant. Various characterizations indicated that C-CuFe/N has the largest specific surface area, highest content of Fe(II), most surface oxygen and active sites, and importantly, stable M-N-x bond, indicating that UN and FN exhibited an excellent synergistic effect. According to the quenching experiments, the dominant reactive oxygen species for C-CuFe, C-CuFe/UN and C-CuFe/FN were radical species (<middle dot>OH and O-2(center dot)-), while they changed to non-radical species (O-1(2)) for C-CuFe/N under acidic condition. Alternatively, C-CuFe/N showed a good catalytic performance (97.2-92.3%) over a wide initial pH range (1.2-11.3), but during the degradation process, all the pH values changed toward neutral, and the oxidation pathway varied from O-1(2)-dominated under acidic condition to radical-dominated under neutral or alkaline condition. Generally, a good synergistic effect was found to exist between the dual nitrogens, which promoted the catalytic activity as well as stability of the catalyst, thus providing a good strategy to design catalysts.

TI One-step synthesis of nitrogen-doped sludge carbon as a bifunctional
   material for the adsorption and catalytic oxidation of organic
   pollutants
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) materials have been extensively investigated for their great potential applications in adsorption, catalysis, etc. Herein, we report a facile one-step pyrolysis process for NC synthesis using abundant bio-waste of excess sludge as carbon source and cheap precursor of urea as nitrogen source. The developed materials were evaluated for organic pollutants removal through adsorption and catalytic oxidation by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Experimental results demonstrated that nitrogen doping significantly affected the elemental composition and microstructure of NC, leading to improved adsorption capability as well as PMS activation activity for methylene blue (MB) removal. The adsorption capacity for MB reached 35.831 mg g(-1) over NC-700 sample (NC prepared at 700 degrees C). In MB catalytic oxidation experiments, effects of sample calcination temperature, catalyst dosage, PMS loading, and co-existing ions were investigated. Under optimal reaction conditions, 98.70% of MB could be removed in 20 min. Through radical quenching and electron spin resonance (ESR) tests, it was confirmed that singlet oxygen (O-1(2) ) was the main reactive species for MB degradation. Additionally, NC-700 performed well in recycle studies without significant efficiency loss. Other typical organic pollutants including malachite green (MG), methyl orange (MO), bisphenol A (BPA), phenol (PE), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) could also be removed using NC-700 as adsorbent and catalyst. These features manifest that excess sludge-derived NC could be a promising material for organic pollutants remediation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Synthesis of urea from CO2 and N2 fixation under
   mild conditions using polarized hydroxyapatite as a catalyst
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Polarized hydroxyapatite (p-HAp) has been used as a catalyst for the synthesis of urea coupling N-2, CO2 and water under mild reaction conditions when compared to classical nitrogen fixation reactions, such as the Haber-Bosch process. The reaction of 3 bar of N-2 and 3 bar of CO2 under UV illumination at 120 degrees C (for 48 h) results in a urea yield of 1.5 +/- 0.1 mmol per gram of catalyst (g(c)) with a selectivity close to 80%, whereas the reaction is not successful without UV irradiation. However, the addition of small amounts of NO (314 ppm) produces 15.2 +/- 0.6 and 4.6 +/- 0.4 mmol g(c)(-1) with and without UV illumination, respectively, with the selectivity in both cases being close to 100%. As nitrogen fixation without UV irradiation using p-HAp as a catalyst is a challenge, studies with NO have been conducted varying the reaction conditions (time, pressure and temperature). The results suggest a mechanism based on the production of NH4+ through the oxidation of N-2.

TI Synthesis of a Highly Stable Pd@CeO2 Catalyst for Methane

SO ACS OMEGA
AB Making use of synergy between urea and citric acid, a core-shell Pd@CeO2 catalyst with spherical morphology was facilely synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The formation mechanism of the core-shell structure in the presence of citric acid and hydrogen peroxide was studied. Results showed that the Pd@CeO2 catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity in methane oxidation. Pd nanoparticles were well stabilized by CeO2 shell encapsulation, resulting in high stability of the catalyst. A high CH4 conversion of 99% was retained after 50 h on-stream reaction at 500 degrees C. Additionally, many tiny pores on the CeO2 shell surface were beneficial for the full contact between reactants and active components. Pd nanoparticles were highly dispersed inside the shell, improving the utilization efficiency of active components. The results also demonstrated that the Pd species in the catalyst existed in the form of oxidation state, mainly in PdO (ca. 66.6%), which played an essential part in methane combustion.

TI Fe-Doped Ni3S2 Induces Self-Reconstruction for
   Urea-Assisted Water Electrolysis Enhancement
SO LANGMUIR
AB Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an attractive alternative anodic reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for its low thermodynamic potential (0.37 V vs RHE). A major challenge that prohibits its practical application is the six-electron transfer process during UOR, demanding enhancements in the catalytic activity. Herein, a Fe-doped Ni3S2 catalyst with a uniform flower-like structure is synthesized in situ on nickel foam via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The electrochemical properties of Fe-Ni3S2 are significantly improved since a current density of 10 mA cm-2 only requires a 1.33 V potential and remains stable for 60 h. The structural characterization demonstrates a strong interaction between Fe and Ni3S2. After Fe doping, the active site increases, which promotes the formation of NiOOH on the catalyst surface, thus speeding up the UOR process. These changes are beneficial to charge transfer and optimize the adsorption energy of the intermediates. In situ EIS further confirms that Fe promotes electron transfer during the UOR process, reduces the interface resistance between the catalyst and the electrolyte, and lowers the driving voltage.

TI One-Step Treatment for Upgrading Bleached Bamboo Pulp to Dissolving Pulp
   High Solvency in Green Alkali/Urea Aqueous Solution
SO POLYMERS
AB Bleached bamboo pulp, as a kind of natural cellulose, has received significant attention in the field of biomass materials due to its advantages of environmental protection and the abundance of raw materials. Low-temperature alkali/urea aqueous system is a green dissolution technology for cellulose, which has promising application prospects in the field of regenerated cellulose materials. However, bleached bamboo pulp, with high viscosity average molecular weight (M eta) and high crystallinity, is difficult to dissolve in an alkaline urea solvent system, restraining its practical application in the textile field. Herein, based on commercial bleached bamboo pulp with high M eta, a series of dissolvable bamboo pulps with suitable M eta was prepared using a method of adjusting the ratio of sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide in the pulping process. Due to the hydroxyl radicals being able to react with hydroxyls of cellulose, molecular chains are cut down. Moreover, several regenerated cellulose hydrogels and films were fabricated in an ethanol coagulation bath or a citric acid coagulation bath, and the relationship between the properties of the regenerated materials and the M eta of the bamboo cellulose was systematically studied. The results showed that hydrogel/film had good mechanical properties, as the M eta is 8.3 x 10(4) and the tensile strength of a regenerated film and the film have values up to 101 MPa and 3.19 MPa, respectively. In this contribution, a simple method of a one-step oxidation of hydroxyl radicals to prepare bamboo cellulose with diversified M eta is presented, providing an avenue for a preparation of dissolving pulp with different M eta in an alkali/urea dissolution system and expanding the practical applications of bamboo pulp in biomass-based materials, textiles, and biomedical materials.

TI A potent liver-mediated mechanism for loss of muscle mass during
   androgen deprivation therapy
SO ENDOCRINE CONNECTIONS
AB Context: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer results in muscular atrophy, due to loss of the anabolic actions of testosterone. Recently, we discovered that testosterone acts on the hepatic urea cycle to reduce amino acid nitrogen elimination. We now hypothesize that ADT enhances protein oxidative losses by increasing hepatic urea production, resulting in muscle catabolism. We also investigated whether progressive resistance training (PRT) can offset ADT-induced changes in protein metabolism.
   Objective: To investigate the effect of ADT on whole-body protein metabolism and hepatic urea production with and without a home-based PRT program.
   Design: A randomized controlled trial.
   Patients and intervention: Twenty-four prostate cancer patients were studied before and after 6 weeks of ADT. Patients were randomized into either usual care (UC) (n = 11) or PRT (n = 13) starting immediately after ADT.
   Main outcome measures: The rate of hepatic urea production was measured by the urea turnover technique using N-15(2)-urea. Whole-body leucine turnover was measured, and leucine rate of appearance (LRa), an index of protein breakdown and leucine oxidation (Lox), a measure of irreversible protein loss, was calculated.
   Results: ADT resulted in a significant mean increase in hepatic urea production (from 427.6 +/- 18.8 to 486.5 +/- 21.3; P < 0.01) regardless of the exercise intervention. Net protein loss, as measured by Lox/Lra, increased by 12.6 +/- 4.9% (P < 0.05). PRT preserved lean body mass without affecting hepatic urea production.
   Conclusion: As early as 6 weeks after initiation of ADT, the suppression of testosterone increases protein loss through elevated hepatic urea production. Short-term PRT was unable to offset changes in protein metabolism during a state of profound testosterone deficiency.

   surfaces
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Co3O4 catalysts were prepared by combustion synthesis using different fuels glycine (G), ODH (O) and urea (U). Morphological changes of the materials were observed by using different fuels. The prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, BET and DRIFTS analysis. All compounds showed 100% conversion of CO below 175C. The prepared catalysts exhibited very high stability and conversions did not decrease even after 50 h of continuous operation. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of materials was measured by H-2-TPR analysis. Co3O4-O is having high OSC among the synthesized catalysts. The activation energies of these catalysts were found to be in the range of 42.3-64.8 kJ mol(-1). With DRIFTS analysis, the surface carbonates, superoxide anions, adsorbed CO, O-2 species on the catalyst surface were found and this information was used to develop a detailed reaction pathway. A kinetic model was developed with the help of proposed mechanism and used to fit the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Highly Integrated Precursor-Derived FePO4/P-Doped C 2D
   Nanofilm- Encapsulated Ni2P@NC Matrix as an Electrocatalyst
   for Energy-Saving Hydrogen Production
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB The construction of environmentally friendly and efficient electrocatalysts is of great significance for energy-saving hydrogen production. Here, we fabricate a phosphate and phosphide composite-based catalyst using the highly integrated precursor 1,1'-bis (diphenylphosphino) ferrocene (DPPF) as integral P, Fe, and C sources. The catalyst was prepared via the vapor deposition process of DPPF on the precursor of 900 degrees C pretreated ZIF-L/NF. Under the induction of P in DPPF, Ni on NF migrates through porous NC to form Ni2P, while DPPF transforms into FePO4/PdC. Therefore, the catalyst has the structure of the FePO4/P-doped C two-dimensional nanofilm-encapsulated Ni2P@NC matrix on NF substrates (named FPPC/Ni2P@NC/NF). Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the FePO4/PdC, Ni2P, and NC matrix, the FPPC/Ni2P@NC/NF catalyst needs only 1.317 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in urea oxidation. Moreover, it also exhibits good OER activity, which requires an overpotential of 292 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2). This work provides a novel and environmentally friendly strategy for the simultaneous construction of metal phosphate and phosphide catalysts.

TI Nitridation of Cr-urea complex into nanocrystalline CrN and its
   antiferromagnetic magnetostructural transition study
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB An antiferromagnetic nanocrystalline CrN interstitial compound was prepared using Cr(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O and urea as starting materials. Initially, a Cr-urea complex was obtained from the solid-state reactions between starting chemicals. Then, the resulting complex was thermally heated to partially decompose into a compound containing Cr-N/Cr-O-N bonds, followed by a nitridation process under the flow of NH3 gas that replaced all the oxygen with nitrogen from the precursor and produced CrN nanoparticles. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the nitridated product confirmed the phase-pure formation of cubic rock-salt CrN with the space group Fm3m. Electron microscopy studies revealed that the CrN nanoparticles agglomerated and the average mean diameter of the nanoparticles was calculated to be 22.92 nm. The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Cr (2p) and N (1s) confirmed the existence of the (+III) oxidation state of Cr in the sample. The antiferromagnetic characteristics of the prepared agglomerated CrN nanoparticles are discussed in comparison to the literature data available of the bulk counterparts. The zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) temperature-dependent magnetization studies showed that the CrN nanoparticles experience an antiferromagnetic transition at a Neel temperature of 265.44 K. At this temperature, the CrN nanocrystals undergo a magnetostructural transition, viz. a paramagnetic cubic lattice transforms into an antiferromagnetic orthorhombic lattice, which can be ascribed to magnetic stress arising during antiferromagnetic-ordering.

TI Comparative study of transition metal (Mn, Fe or Co) catalysts supported
   on titania: Effect of Au nanoparticles addition towards CO oxidation and
   soot combustion reactions
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Manganese, iron and cobalt oxides were supported on TiO2 by deposition-precipitation with urea method then gold nanoparticles were added as a second active phase. The catalysts were evaluated for soot combustion and CO oxidation to elucidate the individual and combined effect of both supported phases. The physicochemical characterization revealed that Mn, Fe and Co were in the form of oxides while Au was in metallic state. The catalytic evaluation for the soot combustion reaction showed a remarkable increase in the activity when the transition metal phase was dispersed on TiO2. It is noteworthy that the performance of the MnOx/TiO2 and CoOx/TiO2 catalysts was superior because they exhibited higher lattice oxygen mobility than the FeOx/TiO2 catalyst, while the effect of Au nanoparticles was to increase selectivity towards CO2. On the other hand, for the CO oxidation, Au active sites were essential and played an important role in carrying out the reaction at lower temperatures. The remarkable activity in the Au-CoOx/TiO2 and Au-FeOx/TiO2 catalysts suggests a promoting effect caused by the combination of the transition metal oxides and Au nanoparticles which helped create new adsorption sites at Au-MOx interfaces for the adsorption and activation of O-2 molecules.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) are considered as promising green energy devices for sustainable energy generation from human waste; however, the lack of efficient urea oxidation reaction electrocatalysts remains a formidable challenge for their practical utility. Herein, we report a flexible, binder-free electrode with a 3-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) architecture on carbon cloth (CC) fibers for high-performance DUFCs. Benefitting from its unique catalytic nanoarchitecture and direct growth on carbon fibers, NiCo2O4/CC-12 demonstrates maximum DUFC power density and durability of 38 mW cm(-2) and 180 h, respectively, which significantly outperform DUFC efficiencies reported previously for other catalysts. The influence of dimension, morphology, and chemical structure of the prepared catalysts towards DUFC performance is detailed. Furthermore, considerable improvement in DUFC performance along with enhanced durability is also achieved for NiCo2O4/CC-12 with human urine, offering a novel technological platform for the conversion of human waste into sustainable energy.

TI Co<SUP>2+</SUP>-Doped Porous Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets Electrode for
   Selective Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Methanol at High Current
   Densities
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Co2+-doped Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets were grown on porous Ni foam by a simple electrodeposition method. The obtained samples were used as porous electrodes for selective electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol to formate in NaOH aqueous solution. The results indicated the oxidizing abilities of the as-prepared electrodes could be regulated by the doping content of Co2+ for the electrooxidation of methanol, in which the electrode with a Co2+ doping content of 10 mol % required a lowest potential of similar to 1.32 V vs. RHE to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) as compared with other electrodes. And the doping of Co2+ helped boosting the Faradic efficiency for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. Moreover, the electrooxidation of methanol for the production of formate (Faradic efficiency >= 96.5 %) with the simultaneous generation of hydrogen was easily implemented in a two-electrode configuration at high current densities (100-500 mA cm(-2)). The results of the durability test further revealed that the 10 mol % Co2+-doped Ni(OH)(2) electrode exhibited an outstanding stability for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol in the present system.

TI Activating the alkaline hydrogen evolution performance of
   Mo-incorporated Ni(OH)2 by plasma-induced heterostructure
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Nickel-based metal oxides/hydroxides are promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction. However, their electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is very poor. Herein, taking Mo-in-corporated nickel hydroxide (Mo-Ni(OH)(2)) as an example, a facile, time-efficient, and low-temperature H-2/N-2 plasma activation strategy is developed to activate the HER performance by constructing heterostructure. This kind of heterostructure is composed of metal, metal alloy, metal nitride, and oxygen vacancy-rithed metal hydroxide with more exposed catalytically active sites, enhanced mass activity, and accelerated electron transport. The optimized plasma-activated Mo-Ni(OH)(2) (P-Mo-Ni(OH)(2)) manifests superior HER performance to pristine Mo-Ni(OH)(2) and even comparable to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution. Moreover, when assembling a two-electrode urea-assisted water electrolysis system by using P-Mo-Ni(OH)(2) as both cathode and anode, the assembled cell only need a small voltage of 1.36 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits extremely stable catalytic performance up to 1000 h.

TI Simple synthesis of N-doped catalysts with controllable Pt-Ni
   nanoparticles for high-efficiency ethanol oxidation
SO IONICS
AB Herein, the catalysts contained metal- and nitrogen-doped carriers were synthesized by a novel and simple method. The synthesized catalysts with different particle size and distribution were controlled by adjusting the ratio of urea and metal salt solution. The morphology, microstructure, and particle distribution of the catalysts were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The catalytic performance of the catalysts was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometric i-t curves. It was found that the urea content had an influence on the distribution of metal particles and the size of the nanoparticles. More catalyst active sites were formed on the surface of the catalyst due to that many nitrogen-based functional groups were formed on the surface of the carrier. Compared with other samples, catalyst with urea amount of 100mg (Pt2Ni3/C-N-3 samples) possessed small particle size and uniform distribution, which exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity and stability, and the maximum of forward anodic peak reached 1454mAmg(-1).

AB A tungsten (VI) complex, [WO(O-2)L(CH3OH)], L = (E)-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)isonicotinohydrazide has been synthesized by the action of WO3 with a ONO donor tridentate Schiff base using H2O2. The tungsten(VI) complex has been characterized by CHN, FT-IR, multinuclear (H-1 & C-13) NMR, and UV-Vis. spectroscopic methods. Theoretical calculations, using DFT at the B3LYP level of theory at the Def2-TZVP basis set, for the estimation of geometrical parameters like natural bond orbital (NBO), molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), and frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) analysis of the synthesised compounds showed that the numerical results correspond to the actual findings. The catalytic activity of WO(O-2)L(CH3OH) for the selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to the corresponding aryl aldehydes was studied utilizing various factors, like the nature of the oxidant, the effect of solvent, and the amount of catalyst. The best results were obtained by using 2 mmol of urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) as an oxidant in the presence of 1 mol% of the catalyst in CH3CN under reflux conditions.

TI Effects of surface characteristics of wood on bonding performance of
   low-molar ratio urea-formaldehyde resin
SO JOURNAL OF ADHESION
AB Low-molar ratio UF resin was used in bonding veneers of five wood species. Significantly different bonding strengths were observed among the used wood species. Much higher bonding strengths were found for cherry, sapele mahogany and black walnut, which would be attributed to their natural roughness that allows formation of more mechanical interlockings. After 60s Gliding Arc Discharge (GAD) plasma treatment of wood surface, the wet bonding performance was significantly improved for most of the wood species. The SEM images of wood surface indicated that the roughening, micrometer-scale peeling or etching effects of GAD plasma treatment would be related to the improved bonding performance. XPS characterizations showed that plasma treatment resulted in remarkable increase of O/C ratio for all wood species. Detailed analysis of C1s spectra revealed that drastic oxidation induced by plasma generated high content of oxygen-containing groups, while degradation led to exposure of more oxygen-containing components like cellulose and hemicellulose. In contrast to untreated surface, stronger interactions can be formed between highly polar wood surface and UF resin. GAD plasma appeared to be an efficient tool in both physical and chemical modifications of wood surface.

AB Poly-gamma-glutamic acid (gamma-PGA), a fertilizer synergist, has a significant promotional effect on nitrogen (N) fertilizer efficiency and crop production by regulating N transformation in soil. However, the underlying mechanism of its effect on soil N cycling is not well understood. The effects of gamma-PGA on the soil properties, extracellular enzyme activities (EEA), abundances and community structures of N functional genes (NFGs) involved in urea (UF) hydrolysis (ureC), nitrification (ammonia oxidation archaea amoA (Arch-amoA) and bacterial amoA (Bacterial-amoA)), denitrification (narG, nirK, qnorB, nosZ) and dissimilatory N reduction (nrfA) were investigated in this study by applying gamma-PGA with different N fertilizers (UF; ammonium sulfate, ASF), so as to reveal the microbial mechanism of gamma-PGA on soil N transformation. The results showed that pH, electrical conductivity, NH4+-N and NO3-N content in soil were greatly and differently affected by gamma-PGA when applied with UF and ASF. gamma-PGA significantly stimulated the microbial biomass N content and EEA activities, except that gamma-PGA significantly inhibited the activities of urease and beta-1,4-glucosidase when applied with UF. gamma-PGA, with UF fertilization, significantly reduced the abundance of ureC, Arch-amoA, Bacterial-amoA and nrfA and significantly increased that of qnorB and nosZ, while gamma-PGA, with ASF fertilization, significantly improved the abundance of Arch-amoA, Bacterial-amoA, qnorB and nosZ and significantly reduced that of narG and nirK. Soil pH and beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity were the best explanatory variables for the abundance variations of NFGs. gamma-PGA greatly affected the community diversity and richness of Arch-amoA, Bacterial-amoA, narG, qnorB and nosZ, and evidently changed the community composition of all NFGs and showed different effects when applied with different N fertilizers. Our results demonstrate that gamma-PGA regulates soil N transformation by altering the abundance and community of NFGs and showed different alterations when applied with different N fertilizers.

TI Optimization of chemoenzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of
   cyclohexanone to ε-caprolactone using response surface methodology
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS
AB epsilon-Caprolactone (epsilon-CL) has attracted a great deal of attention and a high product concentration is of great significance for reducing production cost. The optimization of epsilon-CL synthesis through chemoenzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation mediated by immobilized Trichosporon laibacchii lipase was studied using response surface methodology (RSM). The yield of epsilon-CL was 98.06% with about 1.2 M epsilon-CL concentration that has a substantial increase mainly due to both better stability of the cross-linked immobilized lipase used and the optimum reaction conditions in which the concentration of cyclohexanone was 1.22 M, the molar ratio of cyclohexanone:urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) was 1:1.3, and the reaction temperature was 56.5 degrees C. Based on our experimental results, it can be safely concluded that there are three reactions in this reaction system, not just two reactions, in which the third reaction is that the acetic acid formed reacts with UHP to form peracetic acid in situ catalyzed by the immobilized lipase. A quadratic polynomial model based on RSM experimental results was developed and the R-2 value of the equation is 0.9988, indicating that model can predict the experimental results with high precision. The experimental results also show that the molar ratio of cyclohexanone to UHP has very significant impact on the yield of epsilon-CL (p < .0006).

TI Electrochemical semi-sacrificial growth of a self-supporting MOF-based
   electrode for urea electrooxidation-coupled water electrolysis
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB Replacing the anodic oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis with thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reactions is appealing for reducing the energy consumption of hydrogen production but is limited by the lack of efficient yet cost-effective electrodes. Herein, a self-supporting NiFe-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA) electrode (NiFe-PBA-NF) was directly prepared via a facile semi-sacrificial anodic electrodeposition strategy, in which ultrasmall NiFe-PBA nanoparticles were grown uniformly and compactly on the nickel foam (NF) surface. Benefiting from its ingenious structure and the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe sites, the as-prepared NiFe-PBA-NF exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a required potential of only 1.375 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), outperforming the powdered NiFe-PBA and even the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, a Ru-NiFe-PBA-NF electrode assembled with ultrathin Ru-doped NiFe-PBA nanosheets was fabricated through further Ru-modification treatment, which exhibited a remarkable electrochemical performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), even better than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Ultimately, a UOR-coupled energy-saving hybrid water electrolysis system was constructed by employing Ru-NiFe-PBA-NF and NiFe-PBA-NF as the electrodes for the cathodic HER and anodic UOR, respectively, which only requires a cell voltage of 1.36 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), far superior to a conventional water electrolysis system. This work provides a novel way to design advanced organic-inorganic hybrid-based electrodes and innovative water electrolysis systems for efficient hydrogen production.

TI Galvanic displacement on electrodeposited tangled Zn nanowire
   sacrificial template for preparing porous and hollow Ni electrodes in
   ionic liquid
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS
AB Tangled-Zn nanowire-composed porous structures were prepared via electrodeposition at particular applied potentials in an amide-type ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl) amide (IL [BMP][TFSA]) containing ZnCl2. The porous Zn was used as a sacrificial template for preparing a porous nickel duplicate via galvanic displacement in [BMP][TFSA] containing [NiCl4](2-). The solid tangled Zn-nanowires were converted to hollow NiZn-nanotubes in which a typical galvanic displacement reaction occurred through the alloying/dealloying mechanism, and the Kirkendall effect might also took place to form the bi-walled tubes at some spots. In general, the atomic content of Ni exchanged from Zn increased with the increment of reaction time, concentration of [NiCl4](2-), and temperature. The obtained NiZn could be almost completely dealloyed as verified by the XPS analyses to form a porous Ni electrode that displayed high stability and activity to electrooxidation of urea in alkaline solutions. This study indicated that [BMP][TFSA] played a crucial role on successfully cloning porous Ni from its Zn counterpart. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Printed flexible bifunctional electrochemical urea-pH sensor based on
   multiwalled carbon nanotube/polyaniline electronic ink
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB Urea concentration and pH are two crucial parameters in food and clinical analysis. Traditional analytical methods of urea and pH determination are unsuitable for field and involve complex instrumentation or and enzyme-based assays. In this study, we used screen printing technology to prepare an electrochemical sensor with a carbon electrode modified by a multiwalled carbon nanotube/polyaniline (MWCNT/PANi) composite for the simultaneous detection of urea and pH. Urea was detected by a simple current-potential (I-V) experiment and its concentration level on the MWCNT/PANi-modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) surface was determined by cyclic voltammetry. The MWCNT/PANi-modified SPCE had a linear response (R-2=0.99902), lower detection limit, higher selectivity, and higher sensitivity than reported biosensors. Specifically, the detection limit was 10 mu M and the sensitivity was 0.38mA mM(-1) cm(-2) in the urea concentration range of 10-50 mu M. Chronoamperometry was applied to investigate the changes in voltage on the MWCNT/PANi-modified SPCE with varying solution pH. The sensor exhibited excellent linearity (R-2=0.99089) and an average sensitivity of 20.63mV/pH over a wide pH range of 2-11. Thus, the MWCNT/PANi-modified SPCE has a promising field application as a simple, bifunctional non-enzymatic sensor.

TI Integrative Ni@Pd-Ni Alloy Nanowire Array Electrocatalysts Boost
   Hydrazine Oxidation Kinetics
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Owing to the oxophilic property of Ni catalysts and their sluggish kinetics toward the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), an ultra-low amount of Pd is incorporated with Ni to form integrative Ni@Pd-Ni alloy nanowire array electrocatalysts by using templated electrodeposition and subsequent galvanic replacement. The morphology, crystalline structure, and composition of the as-prepared catalysts are characterized by using FESEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, and ICP. The electrochemical evaluation shows that the onset potential of the Ni@Pd-Ni alloy nanowire arrays for HzOR is -0.99 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is significantly lowered by 800 mV than that for the Ni nanowire arrays. Two possible factors contribute to the robust HzOR kinetics: 1) the metallization of Ni by the PdHx; 2) the heterogeneous catalytic pathway on the Pd-Ni alloy. Furthermore, the innovative structure also endows Ni@Pd-Ni alloy nanowire arrays with considerable durability, indicating it as a promising anode electrocatalyst for HzOR-assisted hydrogen production and simultaneous hydrazine-containing sewage treatment.

TI Positive feedback on dewaterability of waste-activated sludge by the
   conditioning process of Fe(II) catalyzing urea hydrogen peroxide
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The treatment and disposal of sludge is a complex environmental problem because of the high moisture content. Herein, We reported the process of Fe(II) activating Urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) to improve waste activated sludge (WAS) dewaterability for the first time. Fe(II)/UHP was proven to significantly improve WAS dewaterability. Specifically, under the optimal conditions with 60/35-Fe(II)/UHP mg/g TSS, the CST, SRF, and WCSC of WAS reduced from 215.3 +/- 7.5s, 9.2 +/- 0.32 (x 1012 m/kg), and 92.2 +/- 0.7% (control) to 62.3 +/- 4.3s, 2.8 +/- 0.09 (x 1012m/kg), and 70.4 +/- 0.4%, respectively. Further analysis revealed that center dot OH was generated in the Fe (II)/UHP system and played the dominant role in enhancing WAS dewaterability. center dot OH was found to attack extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) and cells, causing EPSs fragmentation and decomposition part of EPSs into micro-molecule organics or even inorganics, and leading to cell destruction, thus liberating the EPSs-bound and cells-bound water. center dot OH also degraded the protein in centrifugal liquor (CL) into micro-molecule organics such as amino acids, which could reduce the viscosity and electronegativity of CL. The above facts ultimately reduced solid-liquid interface interaction but increased hydrophobicity, flocculation, and flowability of WAS. Meanwhile, the broken WAS flocs were then re-flocculated via adsorption bridging and charge neutralization induced by Fe(II) and Fe(III). Moreover, Fe(II)/UHP treatment achieved the reduction and stabilization of heavy metals of dewatered sludge, which further enabled its land application. Finally, the Fe(II)/UHP process was found to be more attractive than the Fe(II)/persulfate, classical Fenton processes, and cPAM in terms of cost savings and practical implementation.

TI Metal-free electrified membranes for contaminants oxidation: Synergy
   effect between membrane rejection and nanoconfinement
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Electro-Fenton processes are frequently impeded by depletion of metal catalysts, unbalance between H2O2 generation and activation, and low concentration of reactive species (e.g., center dot OH) in the bulk solution. A metal-free electro-Fenton membrane was fabricated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO). N-CNT acted as a catalyst for both H2O2 generation and activation, while the incorporated RGO served as the second catalyst for H2O2 generation and improved the performance of membrane rejection. The electrified membrane was optimized in terms of nitrogen precursors selection and composition of N-CNT and RGO to achieve optimal coupling between H2O2 generation and activation. The membrane fabricated with 67% mass of N-CNT with urea as the precursor achieved over 95% removal of the target contaminants in a single pass through the membrane with a water flux of 63 L m-2 h-1. This membrane also exhibited efficient transformation of various concentrations of contaminants (i.e., 1-10 mg L-1) over a broad range of pH (i.e., 3-9). Due to its good durability and low energy consumption, the metal-free electro-Fenton membrane holds promise for practical water treatment application. The concentration-catalytic oxidation model elucidated that the elevated contam-inant concentration near the membrane surface enhanced the transformation rate by 40%. The nanoconfinement enhanced the transformation rate constant inside the membrane by a factor of 105 because of elevated center dot OH concentration inside the nanopores. Based on the prediction of this model, the configuration of the membrane reactor has been optimized.

TI Co-doped MnS/NiS/Ni3S2 grown in situ on
   hydrophilic nickel foam for energy-efficient urea-assisted alkaline
   hydrogen production
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB The electrochemical oxidation of urea provides a promising pathway for hydrogen production with a theoretically reduced energy consumption of 93% lower than water electrolysis. Therefore, designing efficient bifunctional non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts capable of catalyzing both urea oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction are important. Herein, a Co-doped MnS/NiS/Ni3S2 catalyst with a complex structure of nanoparticles and nanosheets simultaneously grown on a 3D hydrophilic nickel foam (HNF) was prepared via electrodeposition and a two-step hydrothermal method. The resulting catalyst (Co-MnS/NiS/Ni3S2/HNF) exhibited a remarkable performance as a self-supported bifunctional electrode for UOR and HER, requiring overpotentials of only 1.313 V at 50 mA cm(-2) and 34 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. At a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2), an overpotential of only 1.343 V was required for UOR, which is about 202 mV lower than OER carried in 1 M KOH to achieve the same current density. Further, the performance of the electrocatalyst showed no apparent deterioration in the 96 h stability test for HER and UOR. Furthermore, we designed an alkaline electrolytic cell with the bifunctional Co-MnS/NiS/Ni3S2/HNF catalyst, which compared to the traditional electrolytic cell for water splitting (OER & Vert;HER) showed a reduction in voltage by 300 mV, driving a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at only 1.75 V in 1 M KOH + 0.33 M urea. The faradaic efficiency of hydrogen production was calculated to be about 100%. Overall, this work provides a new paradigm in the design of efficient bifunctional non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for HER and UOR in alkaline media.

TI Anchoring Ni3S2/Cr(OH)3 hybrid
   nanospheres on Ti3C2@NF dual substrates by ion
   exchange for efficient urea electrolysis
SO NANOSCALE
AB Developing efficient nonprecious-metal urea oxidation reaction (UOR) electrocatalysts will promote large-scale hydrogen production via electrolytic water splitting. Therefore, on dual substrates consisting of nickel foam (NF) with high-conductivity Ti3C2 adsorbed on it, Ni3S2/Cr(OH)(3) nanosphere catalysts were facilely in situ constructed at room temperature via an ion-exchange method. The optimized electrode exhibits obvious advantages and excellent stability in a solution of 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea, with an overpotential of 130 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the UOR. The two-electrode system requires merely 1.52 V to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and shows excellent durability over 60 h. The superior performance of the electrode is mainly attributed to the following three aspects: (i) the introduction of amorphous Cr(OH)(3), which improves the catalyst morphology and regulates the electronic structure of the active metal; (ii) the synergistic catalysis by the defect-rich Ni3S2 and Cr(OH)(3) on the nanospheres; (iii) the large adsorption surface and excellent electrical conductivity provided by the dual substrates; and (iv) the mild preparation process, which provides excellent stability for the electrode. The ingenious structural design and simple preparation method of Ni3S2/Cr(OH)(3)-Ti3C2@NF provide ideas for the development of low-cost, high-efficiency UOR electrodes with industrial application prospects.

TI Experimental and modeling study of visible light responsive
   photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) materials for toluene degradation
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Only limited research has examined the development and application of visible light responsive photocatalytic oxidation (PCO), although such materials have great potential for mitigating concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when applied to building surfaces. This study evaluates the performance and characteristics of a visible light responsive photocatalyst, specially, a co-alloyed TiNbON compound with a band energy of 2.3 eV. The PCO material was developed using urea -glass synthesis, characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) methods, and VOC removal efficiency was measured under visible light for toluene (1-5 ppm) at room temperature (21.5 degrees C) over a range of relative humidity (RH: 25-65%), flow rate (0.78-7.84 cm/s), and irradiance (42-95 W/m(2)). A systematic parametric evaluation of kinetic parameters was conducted. In addition, we compared TiNbON with a commercial TiO2-based material under black light, estimated TiNbON's long-term durability and stability, and tested its ability to thermally regenerate. Using mass transfer and kinetic analysis, three different LangmuirHinshelwood (LH) type reaction rate expressions were proposed and evaluated. A LH model considering one active site and competitive sorption of toluene and water was superior to others. The visible -light driven catalyst was able to remove up to 58% of the toluene, generated less formaldehyde than the commercial TiO2, could be fully regenerated at 150 degrees C, and had reasonable durability and stability. This evaluation of TiNbON shows the potential to remove VOCs and improve air quality for indoor applications. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential for harmful by-products, to identify optimal conditions, and to use field tests to show real -world performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Modified graphene as potential additive for urea formaldehyde (UF) resin
   in medium density fiberboard (MDF) manufacturing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES
AB In this study, graphene oxide (GO) and ethylenediamine-functionalized graphene oxide (EDA-GO) materials were used as a multifunction additive in a UF resin to test the relevant effects on the release of formaldehyde from medium density fiberboard (MDF). The GO was synthesized from graphite using the modified hummers method. Then, the as-synthesized GO was functionalized with ethylenediamine (EDA). The as-synthesized and modified nanomaterials were characterized by XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, AFM, and SEM-EDS techniques. These tests confirmed that the nanomaterials were of the required quality, and they were added to the resin to make the relevant panels. After making the boards, they were tested to determine their physical and mechanical properties, as well as formaldehyde emission based on relevant standards. Modulus of elasticity and formaldehyde emission reduction of the EDA-GO3-treated MDF panel were with the highest values. On the contrary, the higher performance of GO than that of EDA-GO was observed in a thermal property (t100 degrees C). Microstructure and polar increase in the graphite planes network, due to oxidation, may be considered for its GO effects. Aminofunctionalization of graphene oxide planes is suggested as the cause of the minimum formaldehyde emission and the maximum modulus of elasticity in the EDA-GO-incorporated MDF board since resin reaction sites with formaldehyde were enhanced by increasing the amine group content.

TI Metal-free para-C-H Hydroxylation of Aryl-urea Derivatives
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The silica gel promoted straightforward remote para-C-H hydroxylation of aryl-urea derivatives under metal-free mild conditions by using diacetoxyiodobenzene as oxidant has been developed. Replacing the Lewis acids with silica gel effectively improved the tolerance of functional groups and resulted in a wide range of target compounds with various substituents in moderate to excellent yields. Moreover, this transformation has been demonstrated that could more effectively and conveniently synthesize pharmaceutical and biomedical compounds which contain 4-hydroxyarlyurea skeleton.

TI Catalytic oxidation of cellobiose over TiO2 supported
   gold-based bimetallic nanoparticles
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A series of Au-M (M = Cu, Co, Ru and Pd) bimetallic catalysts were supported on TiO2 via a deposition-precipitation (DP) method, using urea as a precipitating agent. The resulting catalysts were employed in the catalytic oxidation of cellobiose to gluconic acid and the properties of these catalysts were carefully examined using various characterization techniques. Cu-Au/TiO2 and Ru-Au/TiO2 catalysts demonstrated excellent catalytic activities in the oxidation of cellobiose to gluconic acid, though with contrasting reaction mechanisms. Complete conversion of cellobiose (100%) with a gluconic acid selectivity of 88.5% at 145 degrees C within 3 h was observed for reactions performed over Cu-Au/TiO2; whereas, a conversion of 98.3% with a gluconic acid selectivity of 86.9% at 145 degrees C within 9 h was observed for reactions performed over Ru-Au/TiO2. A reaction pathway was proposed based on the distribution of reaction products and kinetic data. It is suggested that cellobiose is converted to cellobionic acid (4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-gluconic acid) and then gluconic acid is formed through the cleavage of the beta-1,4 glycosidic bond in cellobionic acid over Cu-Au/TiO2 catalysts. On the other hand, for reactions over the Ru-Au/TiO2 catalyst, glucose was observed as the reaction intermediate and gluconic acid was formed as a result of glucose oxidation. For reactions over Co-Au/TiO2 and Pd-Au/TiO2 catalysts, fructose was observed as the reaction intermediate, along with small amounts of glucose. Co and Pd remarkably promoted the successive retro-aldol condensation reactions of fructose to glycolic acid, instead of the selective oxidation to gluconic acid.

TI Impact of of sterilization and oxidation processes on the additive
   blooming observed on the surface of polyurethane
SO EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL
AB The surface state is a major parameter for the biocompatibility of medical devices. During storage, the blooming of additives may occur on the surface of polymers and modify their properties. In this study, the impact of sterilizing and oxidation treatments on blooming was studied. The study was realized on polyurethane used in the fabrication of catheters on which the blooming of antioxidant crystals has been previously observed. Sterilization by ionizing radiations (beta, gamma) was performed on this material and samples were submitted to different kinds of oxidation process (UV, H2O2 and macrophages action). Surface evolution was investigated using AFM microscopy, FTIR-ATR and SEM.

TI Unlocking the potential of NiCo2O4 nanocomposites:
   morphology modification based on urea concentration and hydrothermal and
   calcination temperature
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are critical in minimizing energy loss during the anodic four-electron transfer process that is required for water oxidation. Improving and selecting optimal non-noble OER electrocatalysts are key strategies for elevating their overall performance and efficiency of energy storage and conversion. Eight NiCo2O4 electrocatalysts were synthesized using the hydrothermal method by changing the amount of urea as a nucleation agent and hydrothermal and calcination temperature to achieve an outstanding catalyst in terms of morphology and electrochemical activity. For examining the physicochemical properties of the electrocatalyst, analyses such as XRD, SEM, TEM, and EDS were conducted. Although XRD analysis revealed the formation of pure NiCo2O4 for all eight samples, SEM and TEM analysis unraveled the best electrocatalyst in terms of morphology to be NiCo-S3 (urea: 10 times higher, T-hydrothermal: 120 degrees C, and T-Calcination: 350 degrees C) and NiCo-S4 (urea: 10 times higher, T-hydrothermal: 120 degrees C, and T-Calcination: 400 degrees C) with a mum-flower-like shape and particle dimension between 20 and 45 nm. NiCo-S4 displayed robust electrochemical activity, primarily in the OER, with an overpotential of 327 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M aqueous KOH solution. The OER performance was enhanced as demonstrated by the exceptional durability of >24 hours and a Tafel slope of 79.7 mV dec(-1). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed a low resistance of 1.03 Omega and a double-layer capacitance of 2.43 mF cm(-2), substantiating the outstanding OER performance of NiCo-S4.

TI Synthesis and characterization of novel
   Au/θ-Al2-xFexO3 nanomaterials with high
   thermal stability in catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB Applications as a catalyst in engine exhaust systems require a uniform distribution of gold nanoparticles on a thermally stable alumina support. The novel thermally stable nanomaterials comprised of gold nanoparticles on the iron-modified theta-alumina support have been synthesized by the method of deposition-precipitation using urea. The material precursor was proved to involve both a gold precursor and adsorbed urea. The generation of gold nanoparticles from the gold precursor occurred below 300 degrees C, whereas the complete elimination of organic compounds proceeded only at 500 degrees C in air or even at 650700 degrees C in a reducing gas flow. The gold particle size distribution was narrow with a mean size about 2 nm and 3.4 nm after calcination at 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C respectively. The prepared materials are highly active and stable as the catalysts of carbon monoxide oxidation in the presence of ammonia, and maintain the catalytic activity even after prolong thermal treatment at 750 degrees C.
