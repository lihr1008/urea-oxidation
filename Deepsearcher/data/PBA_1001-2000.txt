TI High-Efficiency Bimetallic Catalyst Prepared in Situ from Prussian Blue
   Analogues for Catalytic Water Oxidation
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB The synergistic catalysis of bimetallic catalysts is one of the important ways to improve the catalytic performance; therefore, the development of efficient bimetallic water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) has received extensive attention. This work proposed a bimetallic Fe3O4/CuO catalyst prepared in situ from the Cu-Fe Prussian blue analogues precursor, promoting Fe3O4-modified CuO as a highly efficient and stable bimetallic WOC. The Fe3O4/CuO exhibits superior and robust catalytic activity for the oxidation of water. Compared with the reported results, it has a higher O-2 evolution rate of about 4406 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) and a maximum value for the yield of O-2 as 83.2%, mainly because of the synergetic effect between Fe3O4 and CuO in the complicated water oxidation reaction (WOR) process. We hope this work will be useful for other researchers to design new transition metal bimetallic catalysts for WOR.

TI Prussian blue analogue-derived hollow metal oxide heterostructure for
   high-performance supercapacitors
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Supercapacitors (SCs) have been the subject of considerable interest because of their distinct advantages. The performance of SCs is directly affected by the electrode materials. Metal oxides derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are often used as electrode materials for SCs. Herein, we developed a multi-step strategy to fabricate ternary hollow metal oxide (CuO/NiO/Co3O4) heterostructures. The core-shell structured PBA (NiHCC@CuHCC) with Ni-based PBA (NiHCC) as the core and Cu-based PBA (CuHCC) as the shell was prepared by a crystal seed method. The ternary metal oxide (CuO/NiO/Co3O4) with a hollow structure was obtained by calcinating NiHCC@CuHCC. The prepared CuO/NiO/Co3O4 demonstrates an excellent specific capacitance of 262.5 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), which is 27.4% and 16.2% higher than those of CuO/Co3O4 and NiO/Co3O4, respectively. In addition, the material showed outstanding cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 107.9% after 3000 cycles. The two-electrode system constructed with CuO/NiO/Co3O4 and nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogel (NDGH) demonstrates a stable and high energy density of 27.1 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 1037.5 W kg(-1). The capacitance retention rate was 100.7% after 4000 cycles. The reason for the excellent electrochemical properties could be the synergistic effect of the introduced heterojunction of CuO/NiO, the hollow structure, and various metal oxides. This strategy can greatly inspire the construction of SC electrodes.

TI Operando Synchrotron-Based X-ray Study of Prussian Blue and Its
   Analogue as Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB In this study, we employed operando synchrotron-based X-ray techniques to monitor potential-dependent oxidation-state changes of metal components and lattice spacings of Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues as sodium-ion battery materials in real time. Operando X-ray absorption near edge structure measurements revealed that iron is the only redox active component in both PB and its analogue substituted with nickel (PBN). Operando X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that relative to PB, PBN shows better structural stability and rate capability, ascribed to smaller volumetric changes during cycling and state of charge as well as larger diffusion coefficients.

TI Synthesis of Trimetallic Prussian Blue Analogues and Catalytic
   Application for the Epoxidation of Styrene
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB A series of trimetallic Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has been synthesized by adding Fe or Cu to five types of bimetallic PBAs: FeCoPBA, CdCoPBA, CoCoPBA, MnCoPBA, and ZnCoPBA. Such compounds have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurement. They generally had smaller particle sizes and weaker diffraction peaks than the corresponding bimetallic PBAs. Then, supplementary characterizations on the CuZnCo PBA and CuCdCo PBA showed that the crystallization process, the specific surface area, and the acid sites of the trimetallic PBAs are all different from those of the corresponding bimetallic PBAs. Thermodynamic data obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that the synthesis of the CuZnCo PBA and CuCdCo PBA is a spontaneous exothermic process with values of enthalpy change in the same range as the corresponding bimetallic PBAs. Such compounds were used as heterogeneous catalysts for the epoxidation of styrene. The results revealed that the catalytic activity of the trimetallic PBA was more efficient than the one of the corresponding bimetallic PBA. Moreover, the experiment of reusability and stability shows that the CuCdCo PBA catalyst is pretty stable.

TI Chemical and electrochemical conversion of magnetic nanoparticles to
   Prussian blue for label-free and refreshment-enhanced electrochemical
   biosensing of enrofloxacin
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Magnetic biosensor takes advantage of rapid and facile magnetic separation/collection of targets, however, generally relies on additional signal labels to generate signal in a tedious and high-cost way. Here, we proposed a chemical and electrochemical conversion (C-ECC) method to develop a label-free electrochemical magnetic biosensor to detect antibiotics enrofloxacin (ENR). The C-ECC method integrates the chemical decomposition of magnetic beads (MBs) to release ironic ions and the simultaneous electrochemical deposition of Prussian blue (PB) analogs through the reaction of ironic ions and co-existing K4Fe(CN)6. Unlike conventional method that relies on the physical magnetic property of MBs, the C-ECC method fully exploited the chemical/electrochemical properties of MBs to produce electrochemically active PB to generate signal, thus endowing MBs with dual roles in both sample treatment and signal generation. The incorporation of chemical and electrochemical conversion produced more PB with higher electroactivity when compared with sole chemical or electrochemical conversion. Moreover, an interesting electrochemical refreshment (ER) was designed to remove insulative species on the electrode surface to improve electroactivity of electrode and benefit amperometric detection significantly.

TI Development of magnetic nickel prussian blue analog composites using
   simple synthesis treatment for efficient cesium removal
SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
AB The radioactive cesium species (e.g., Cs-137) in radioactive waste have necessitated the development of strategies for its selective removal from contaminated water. In this study, we synthesized nickel-modified Prussian blue/maghemite (NiPB/gamma-Fe2O3) composite materials exhibiting high selectivity for Cs ions. The composites were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction, and their magnetism was confirmed through an X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurement. The composites selectively separated Cs from solutions containing alkali and alkaline earth metal cations, with a removal efficiency of >= 99.7 %. The synthesis mechanism involved the hydrothermal reaction, including partial oxidation and subsequent gamma-Fe2O3 formation. The maximum adsorption capacity of the NiPB/gamma-Fe2O3 composites, assuming successful magnetic separation, was determined to be 102 mg g(-1) using the Langmuir adsorption model. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns revealed enhanced crystallinity in the composites compared to NiPB, with a distorted structure framework from face-centered cubic to rhombohedral. XAS spectra showed changes in vibration peaks due to hydrothermal treatment, indicating partial oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III). The composites exhibited superparamagnetism, whereas NiPB showed no magnetization. These findings highlight the potential of NiPB/gamma-Fe2O3 composites in environmental remediation and radioactive waste management, providing an effective solution for Cs removal from contaminated systems.

TI X-ray spectroscopic analysis of Liesegang patterns in Mn-Fe-based
   Prussian blue analogs
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY
AB We performed time-resolved X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and position-dependent X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements on gels containing Mn2+ and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions. A sample tube containing an agar gel mixed with 0.20 M MnCl2 solution and a water-glass gel mixed with 0.25 M K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] solution was prepared for these X-ray spectroscopic analyses. Periodic bands that obeyed the empirical scaling laws characteristic of Liesegang bands formed beyond the turbid zone in the water-glass gel. XRF results demonstrated that the turbid zone and the periodic bands contained diffusive Mn and Fe compounds. XANES results indicated that the Fe local structure in the sample tube was nearly independent of positions and was predominantly [Fe(CN)(6)]. In contrast, the Mn local structure depended on the position. FEFF calculations suggested that Mn-Fe-based Prussian blue analogs, of which the most likely local structure is [Mn(NCFe)(3)O3K3], co-existed with [MnO6-nCln] (n = 0, 1) species and that their compositions were position-dependent.

TI High yield electrooxidation of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural catalysed by
   unsaturated metal sites in CoFe Prussian Blue Analogue films
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) are promising electrocatalysts for oxidation reactions due to their binary metal composition and tuneable redox properties. Herein, we report the generation of coordinative unsaturated metal sites in pulse electrodeposited (PED) CoFe PBAs for the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The high reactivity by unsaturated metal sites, thoroughly characterized by a suite of spectroscopic techniques, results in a catalyst with superior activity towards the oxidation of HMF to 2,5 furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA).

TI Defect-riched prussian blue analogues with superior adsorption-catalysis
   toward lithium polysulfides for high performance lithium-sulfur
   batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S) garner significant interest within the energy storage industry, because of their exceptional theoretical energy density coupled with employment of environmental materials. Nevertheless, the broader implementation of Li-S batteries faces challenges, primarily due to the lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) shuttle effect and the sluggish conversion kinetics associated with LiPSs. In this work, we introduce a reduction- induced dissolution process to fabricate a mesoporous CoFePB rich in crystal defects via a facile solvothermal method. The experimental results indicate that the abundance of crystal defects originate from the phase transition from Co3[FeIII(CN)6]2 to Co2[FeII(CN)6]. The subsequent adsorption tests and electrochemical evaluations have shown that the defect-rich CoFePB possesses enhanced LiPSs absorption capacity and improved cycling performance in contrast to the pristine CoFePB, which is primarily ascribed to proliferation of active sites emerging as a result of the crystal defects. Consequently, the D-CoFePB-S cathode demonstrates remarkable rate performance with 583 mAh g- 1 at a substantial 5C current rate, superior long-term stability with capacity retention of 64.3 % over 2000 cycles at current rate of 2C and outstanding areal capacity of 4.9 mAh cm- 2 at 0.1C, even under a substantial sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm- 2 .

TI Cubic Co-Co prussian blue MOF-based transition metal phosphide as an
   efficient catalyst for visible light-driven water oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS
AB Designing and developing an efficient, economic and stable catalyst for photocatalytic water oxidation is a forefront topic of sustainable energy research. Herein, we rationally designed a CoP/NC (CoP nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen and carbon matrices) nanocube catalysts via a pyrolysis phosphidation strategy derived from Co-Co/PB (Co-Co prussian blue) MOF-based precursor, which was employed as a robust heterogeneous catalyst for photocatalytic water oxidation for the first time. The TEM and SEM tests exhibit that Co-Co/PB contributes to well-defined nanocube architecture features after phosphidation. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance of CoP/NC nanocube catalyst was examined in photocatalytic water oxidation system using [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) as photosensitizer and S2O82- as sacrificial electron acceptor. The result shows CoP/NC has a modest high O-2 evolution rate of 901.5 mmol h(-1) g(-1), O-2 yield of 36.1%, TOF of 34.5 x 10(-3) mol(O2) mol(metal)(-1) s(-1), and quantum yield of 61.5%. Noteworthily, an amorphous CoOx layer on CoP/NC surface was observed by HRTEM test after light reaction. The amorphous CoOx layer and CoP form a core-shell structure (CoP@CoOx), which facilitates the electron transport effectively. Additionally, the CoP/NC nanocube catalyst shows good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance, which has a higher current density and smaller Tafel slope than CoS2/NC and Co3O4/NC derived from the same precursor of Co-Co/PB with CoP/NC. This strategy of using prussian blue analogue as template to create metal phosphide will provide a platform for exploring highly efficient and stable catalysts for energy conversion reactions.

TI Prussian blue analogue-derived high-entropy alloy nanoarchitectonics for
   efficient Fenton-like catalysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB The selective distribution of reactive oxygen species originating from the optimized activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) offers opportunities to achieve the effective elimination of contaminants in water, but the synergistic mechanism of this process is still unclear, especially the reaction intermediates on the multi-metal catalysts. Herein, we proposed a coordinate metal regulation strategy to modulate active sites by designing an FeCoMnNiCu Prussian blue analogue-derived high-entropy alloy system that possesses a 0D-1D hybrid nanoarchitectonic structure. The electronegativity differences between the metals induce significant variation in the coordination environment during pyrolysis, creating highly active Fe, Co, and Mn sites and secondary active Ni and Cu sites, thus enhancing interfacial electron transfer and reducing the adsorption energy of PMS activation. In situ Raman analysis and DFT calculations revealed that FeIV 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111 00000000 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000 O and OH species were involved in the excitation process followed by the efficient elimination of various pollutants, which represents a breakthrough in the design of multi-metal Fenton-like catalysts for sustainable water decontamination.
   The FeCoMnNiCuNC system accelerates the simultaneous generation of versatile FeIVO and OH by the cooperation of highly active Fe, Co, Mn sites and secondary active Ni, Cu sites, along with the promoting efficiency in oxidating emerging pollutants.

TI Tailorable morphology control of Prussian blue analogues toward
   efficient peracetic acid activation for sulfonamides removal
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB Herein, the relationship between defined morphologies of Prussian blue analogues and their catalytic properties is comprehensively investigated. Solid Co-Fe-Cube and three different hollow morphologies (Box, Cage, and Frame) were successfully synthesized and exhibited distinct activation performance toward peracetic acid. The evolution of hollow interior led to partial disassociation of porous nanostructure, while Co-Fe-Cube with its solid cubic feature, high specific surface area (222.3 m2/g), and excellent stability (minimal leakage of metal ions) achieved the best removal efficiency (around 90 %) of six sulfonamides in 15 min. Organic radicals including CH3CO3 center dot and CH3CO2 center dot are identified to play the dominant role, and Co-Fe bimetal synergic effect induces the regeneration of highly active ---Co(II) sites. This work provides new insights into the structure-activity relationship and paves the way for precise structure control and property modulation of advanced catalysts in water decontamination.

TI A Novel Uric Acid Biosensor Based on Regular Prussian Blue
   Nanocrystal/Upright Graphene Oxide Array Nanocomposites
SO CURRENT ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Background: Uric acid (UA) is an important metabolic intermediate of the human body. Abnormally high levels of UA will cause diseases. However, UA monitoring with commercial products relies on invasive blood collection, which not only causes pain in patients but also risks bacterial infections and skin irritation. In recent years, new models of noninvasive detection through body surface penetration have raised higher expectations for the sensitivity of uric acid detection, and rapid, accurate and highly sensitive UA sensors will become powerful tools for the diagnosis of UA-related diseases.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify the differences in catalytic efficiency between regular PB from spray crystallization (RPB) and irregular PB from electrodeposition (EDPB), which is used for fabricate a high sensitive uric acid sensor.
   Methods: Regular Prussian blue nanocrystals (RPB) were grown on graphene oxide flakes (GO), on the surface of a custom screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE), using a spray method assisted by a constant magnetic field (CMF). After immobilizing uricase, the uric acid biosensor Uricase/RPB/CMF-GO/SPCE was obtained.
   Results: The detection range of the sensor response to UA was 0.005 similar to 2.525 mM, and the detection limit was as low as 3.6 mu M. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results showed that compared to amorphous electrodeposited Prussian blue (EDPB), RPB more favorably accelerated electron transport.
   Conclusion: This novel uric acid biosensor exhibits high sensitivity over a wide concentration range, strong anti-interference ability, and good stability and reproducibility. Thus, it has good application prospects for determining uric acid in physiological samples.

TI Size Engineering and Crystallinity Control Enable High-Capacity Aqueous
   Potassium-Ion Storage of Prussian White Analogues
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Aqueous potassium-ion batteries have demonstrated huge potential in the field of energy storage, owing to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high safety, yet with poor cycling stability and rate capability. Here, potassium Prussian white analogues (K-PW) with different gradients in crystallinity and size have been synthesized by controlling the acidity of hydrothermal environment. The as-synthesized K1.93Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.97)center dot 1.82H(2)O nanoparticles deliver considerable reversible capacities of 142 mAh g(-1) at 75 mA g(-1), even 40 mAh g at 9000 mAg(-1), and high capacity retention of 88% after 300 cycles at 1500 mAg in a KNO3 aqueous electrolyte. High crystallinity and short ion-diffusion length determine the fast ion-intercalation kinetics and, thus, enable the superior rate capability. These results reveal the feasibility of using K-PW for practical applications in aqueous potassium-ion batteries.

TI Iron-based hybrid polyionic complexes as chemical reservoirs for the
   pH-triggered synthesis of Prussian blue nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Hypothesis: Hybrid polyion complexes (HPICs) obtained from the complexation in aqueous solution of a double hydrophilic block copolymer and metal ions can act as efficient precursors for the controlled synthesis of nanoparticles. In particular, the possibility to control the availability of metal ions by playing on the pH conditions is of special interest to obtain nanoparticles with controlled size and composition. Experiments: HPICs based on Fe3+ ions were used to initiate the formation of Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles in presence of potassium ferrocyanide in reaction media with varying pH values. Findings: Complexed Fe3+ ions within HPICs can be easily released by adjusting the pH value either through the addition of a base/acid or by using a merocyanine photoacid. This allows to modulate the reactivity of Fe3+ ions with potassium ferrocyanide present in solution. As a result, PB nanoparticles with different structures (core, core-shell), composition and controlled size are obtained.

TI Monitoring the Zn ion storage of Prussian blue analog via in situ
   spectral imaging strategy
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are rapidly developing, and powerful in situ monitoring methods can play a key role in their evolution, particularly for gaining a deeper understanding of the ion storage process in cathodes. To enhance the capabilities of in situ monitoring methods in the energy storage field, we apply an in situ optical recording technique combined with a multispectral imaging (MSI) reconstruction algorithm to study the charge storage process of ZIBs based on Prussian blue analog cathodes. The method can reconstruct time-domain spectra (TDS) based on optical reflectance at multiple wavelengths during online charging/discharging periods. Although the optical variation of the cathode is small, the reconstructed reflectance and real-time state of charge show excellent linearity with correlation coefficients all higher than 98%. Delicate peak shifts in TDS corresponding to phase variations in the cathodes can also be detected. Above all indicates great potential of the MSI strategy for accelerating the evolution of ZIBs and other batteries in the future.

TI Dual-functional mediators of high-entropy Prussian blue analogues for
   lithiophilicity and sulfiphilicity in Li-S batteries
SO NANOSCALE
AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered promising next-generation energy storage systems due to their high energy density (2600 W h kg-1) and cost-effectiveness. However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides in sulfur cathodes and uncontrollable Li dendrite growth in Li metal anodes significantly impede the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this study, we address these challenges by employing a high-entropy Prussian blue analogue Mn0.4Co0.4Ni0.4Cu0.4Zn0.4[Fe(CN)6]2 (HE-PBA) composite containing multiple metal ions as a dual-functional mediator for Li-S batteries. Specifically, the HE-PBA composite provides abundant metal active sites that efficiently chemisorb lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to facilitate fast redox conversion kinetics of LiPSs. In Li metal anodes, the exceptional lithiophilicity of the HE-PBA ensures a homogeneous Li ion flux, resulting in uniform Li deposition while mitigating the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, our work demonstrates outstanding long-term cycling performance with a decay rate of only 0.05% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. The HE-PBA@Cu/Li anode maintains a stable overpotential even after 600 h at 0.5 mA cm-2 under the total areal capacity of 1.0 mA h cm-2. This study showcases the application potential of the HE-PBA in Li-S batteries and encourages further exploration of prospective high-entropy materials used to engineer next-generation batteries.
   High-entropy Prussian blue analogues containing multiple metal ions are employed as dual-functional mediators in facilitating polysulfide conversion kinetics and regulating Li plating for lithium-sulfur batteries.

TI Surface reconstruction of Ni doped Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues for
   enhanced oxygen evolution
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB An efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process requires fast kinetics to increase water splitting efficiency. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as a promising OER electrocatalyst have attracted more attention due to their surface reconstruction to form active oxyhydroxides layer during the continuous OER process. However, the research on how to optimize the surface reconstruction of PBAs is still lacking. Herein, Ni-doped Co-Fe PBAs nanocubes were designed as an efficient OER catalyst to promote surface-selective etch and reconstruction into metal oxyhydroxides during the activation process. Structural characterization and analysis indicated that the incorporation of Ni enhanced the surface reconstruction, and the resulted metal oxyhydroxides acted as the major active sites for OER electrocatalysis. The rate-determining step is converted to the final O-2 release step after the activation process, which significantly accelerates OER kinetics. As a result, the NiCo-Fe PBAs electrode exhibits excellent catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 274 mV under a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1).

TI In Situ Charge Modification within Prussian Blue Analogue Nanocubes by
   Plasma for Oxygen Evolution Catalysis
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB A targeteddefect-induced strategy of metal sites in a porous frameworkis an efficient avenue to improve the performance of a catalyst. However,achieving such an activation without destroying the ordered frameworkis a major challenge. Herein, a dielectric barrier discharge plasmacan etch the Fe(CN)(6) group of the NiFe Prussian blue analogueframework in situ through reactive oxygen species generated in theair. Density functional theory calculations prove that the changedlocal electronic structure and coordination environment of Fe sitescan significantly improve oxygen evolution reaction catalytic properties.The modified NiFe Prussian blue analogue is featured for only 316mV at a high current density (100 mA cm(-2)), whichis comparable to that of commercial alkaline catalysts. In a solarcell-driven alkaline electrolyzer, the overall electrolysis efficiencyis up to 64% under real operation conditions. Over 80 h long-timecontinuous test under 100 mA cm(-2) highlights superiordurability. The density functional theory calculations confirm thatthe formation of OOH* is the rate-determining step over Fe sites,and Fe(CN)(6) vacancy and extra oxygen atoms can introducecharge redistribution to the catalyst surface, which finally enhancesthe oxygen evolution reaction catalytic properties by reducing theoverpotential by 0.10 V. Both experimental and theoretical resultssuggest that plasma treatment strategy is useful for modifying theskeletal material nondestructively at room temperature, which opensup a broad prospect in the field of catalyst production.
   Dielectric barrier discharge plasma canetch NiFe PBA insitu through reactive oxygen species generated in air. The frameworkstructure can be preserved to the maximum extent. Benefiting fromthe modulated local electronic structure and coordination environmentof Fe sites, the etched NiFe PBA exhibits high catalytic performanceand superior stability for oxygen evolution reaction. In a HER & PAR;OERelectrolysis cell, the voltage is 1.99 V at 100 mA cm(-2), operating continuously for & SIM;83 h.

TI Multimetallic Prussian Blue Analogue Nanoparticles for Oxygen Evolution
   Reaction and Efficient Benzyl Alcohol Oxidation
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Electrocatalytic alcohol assisted water splitting has attained immense interest to improve the energy efficiency of water splitting. A series of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been employed to replace the anodic oxygen evolution reaction with electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation. In this work, we have developed a multimetallic Prussian blue analogue (MnFeCoNiCu-PBA) nanoparticles using a room temperature method and utilized it for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and benzyl alcohol (BA) oxidation. The multimetallic composition resulted in the enhanced synergistic effect and increased the electrochemical surface area and electronic conductivity to improve the catalytic performance. Interestingly, MnFeCoNiCu-PBA nanoparticles exhibited a 100 mA cm(-2) current density for BA oxidation at 1.57 V vs RHE, which was lower than that of OER (1.67 V vs RHE), with 98.9% Faradaic efficiency and 100% selectivity for benzoic acid production. Besides, the hydrogen production was improved by 2.2 times with the BA oxidation compared to the OER. During the electrocatalytic BA oxidation, multimetallic PBA was electrochemically reconstructed into an active metal hydroxide-(oxy)hydroxide catalyst with high valent metal ions, further improving the activity.

TI Unveiling Cs-adsorption mechanism of Prussian blue analogs:
   Cs<SUP>+</SUP>-percolation via vacancies to complete dehydrated
   state
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCF) or Prussian blue analogs are excellent Cs+-adsorbents used for radioactive Cs-decontamination. However, the adsorption mechanism is controversial. To clarify the issue, we quantitatively investigated the Cs-adsorption behaviors of potassium copper hexacyanoferrate (KCuHCF) and A(y)Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](1-x)zH(2)O. To obtain samples having homogeneous chemical composition and particle size, flow systems were used for both synthesis and purification. After sufficient rinsing with water, the range of x stable in aqueous solution in time appropriate for Cs-adsorption was 0.25 < x < 0.50. The relations y = 4 - 2x and z = 10x were also found independent of x, indicating complete dehydration of K+ in the crystal. We concluded that the excellent Cs-selectivity of MHCF was not due to difference in free energy of the adsorbed state between K+ and Cs+ but because of the hydrated state in aqueous solution. We also found that the guiding principle for determining the maximum capacity depended on the chemical composition. In particular, for the range 0.25 < x < 0.35, we propose a new model to understand the suppression of the maximum capacity. In our model, we hypothesize that Cs+ could migrate in the crystal only through [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) vacancies. The model reproduced the observed maximum capacity without fitting parameters. The model would also be applicable to other MHCFs, e.g. a little adsorption by soluble Prussian blue. The ion exchange between Cs+ and H+ occurred only when the implemented K+ was small.

TI Gold nanoparticles conjugated to bimetallic manganese(II) and iron(II)
   Prussian Blue analogues for aptamer-based impedimetric determination of
   the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 and living MCF-7 cells
SO MICROCHIMICA ACTA
AB An aptamer-based assay is described for the determination of trace levels of the cancer marker human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and living MCF-7 cells. The method is based on the use of a bimetallic MnFe Prussian blue analogue coupled to gold nanoparticles (MnFePBA@AuNP). Compared to pristine MnFe PBA nanocubes, the series of MnFePBA@AuNP exhibits a core-shell spherical nanostructure, and the shell thickness decreases from 99.9nm down to 49.3nm on increasing the fraction of AuNPs. The composite was placed on a gold electrode and incubated with the aptamer solution through electrostatic interaction. Then the modified electrode was employed to detect HER2 and MCF-7 cells using [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) as redox probe and displays good responses to both of them. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data show that the signal variation between each step during the whole procedure for the HER2 and MCF-7 cells detection can be embodied as the resistance value change between the [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) and electrode surface. The assay has a very low detection limit (0.247pg.mL(-1)) and works in the 0.001-1.0ng.mL(-1) HER2 concentration range. It was also used to sense HER2 in MCF-7 cells, and this results in an assay that works within the 500-5x10(4) cell.mL(-1) cell concentration range and a 36 cell.mL(-1) detection limit. Furthermore, the aptamer-based assay is selective, acceptably reproducible, stable, and well feasible for the detection of HER2 and living MCF-7 cells in human serum.

TI Multifunctional Prussian blue from nano-structure designed to wearable
   sensors application
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Owing to its extraordinary biocompatibility and promising applications, PB has been highly sought after. It is regarded as a valuable research target in the fields of sensing, energy and catalysis, particularly sensing. The introduction of PB improves the conductivity, stability, and electrocatalytic activity of biosensors, yet these properties are highly dependent on the morphology, size, chemical composition, etc. Therefore, to meet various requirements, engineering of the PB structure on the nanoscale to construct sensors with high stability, high sensitivity, and excellent electrochemical catalytic perfor-mance has received extensive attention. This review aims to offer an up-to-date comprehensive sum-mary of PB materials with various nanostructures, with an emphasis on purpose-driven structure design and application to wearable devices/analytical chemistry. The contents of this review are based on a balanced combination of our studies and selected research done by worldwide academic groups. First, driven by the aim of breaking the limitations caused by the inherent defects of PB, various approaches, such as combining PB with functional materials or substances and constructing hollow or core-shell structures, to improve the electrochemical properties are explored. Then, we evaluate some key appli-cations of PB-based nanomaterials in the area of electrochemical sensors for healthcare, environment monitoring and the food industry based on their different properties. Moreover, flexible wearable sen-sors based on PB are also discussed. The purpose of this review is to provide a better understanding and rational design of the increasingly important material PB as a key candidate for sensing materials. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Prussian blue analogue-derived hollow metal oxide heterostructure for
   high-performance supercapacitors
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Supercapacitors (SCs) have been the subject of considerable interest because of their distinct advantages. The performance of SCs is directly affected by the electrode materials. Metal oxides derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are often used as electrode materials for SCs. Herein, we developed a multi-step strategy to fabricate ternary hollow metal oxide (CuO/NiO/Co3O4) heterostructures. The core-shell structured PBA (NiHCC@CuHCC) with Ni-based PBA (NiHCC) as the core and Cu-based PBA (CuHCC) as the shell was prepared by a crystal seed method. The ternary metal oxide (CuO/NiO/Co3O4) with a hollow structure was obtained by calcinating NiHCC@CuHCC. The prepared CuO/NiO/Co3O4 demonstrates an excellent specific capacitance of 262.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, which is 27.4% and 16.2% higher than those of CuO/Co3O4 and NiO/Co3O4, respectively. In addition, the material showed outstanding cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 107.9% after 3000 cycles. The two-electrode system constructed with CuO/NiO/Co3O4 and nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogel (NDGH) demonstrates a stable and high energy density of 27.1 W h kg-1 at a power density of 1037.5 W kg-1. The capacitance retention rate was 100.7% after 4000 cycles. The reason for the excellent electrochemical properties could be the synergistic effect of the introduced heterojunction of CuO/NiO, the hollow structure, and various metal oxides. This strategy can greatly inspire the construction of SC electrodes.

TI NiCo2O4 nanofeathers derived from prussian blue
   analogues with enhanced electrochemical performance for supercapacitor
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Tuning the morphology and structure at nanoscale has become essential for the advancement of electrode materials. Here, the unique nanofeather arrays composing of 1D nanoneedles and 2D nanosheets are fabricated on nickle foam (NF) through a novel prussian blue analogues (PBA)-in-hydrothermal strategy with Ni-Co PBA as the precursor and template. Then the porous NiCo2O4 nanofeather arrays are formed after calcination, which are consisted of ultrasmall secondary nanoparticles with an average diameter of 3 nm, hence providing high porosity and rich active sites. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of NiCo2O4 1D nanoneedles and 2D nanosheets, the NF@NiCo2O4 nanofeathers electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1797F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and superior rate capability with 85.7% capacitance retention (from 1 A g(-1) to 20 A g(-1)). Furthermore, a high energy density of 53.9 Wh kg(-1) at 801 W kg(-1), a high power density of 16 kW kg(-1) at 39.2 Wh kg(-1) and an outstanding cycling stability of 81.5% capacitance retention at 20 A g(-1) after 10,000 cycles are achieved in the assembled NF@NiCo2O4 nanofeathers//AC device. More importantly, this work provides an attractive strategy to combine PBA and classical hydrothermal process, as well as offers a new insight into the design of advanced energy materials.

TI Prussian blue nanocubes supported on graphene foam as superior
   binder-free anode of lithium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The integration of active materials into graphene foam (GF) is of fundamental importance for developing superior binder-free electrodes. In the present design, Prussian blue (PB) nanocubes were uniformly grown into the GF network by a facile immersion approach. This is the first example of GF supported metal cyanides and their applications as electrode materials. The as-prepared PB and GF/PB samples have been characterized systematically. This free-standing and flexible GF/PB composite electrode exhibited a high reversible gravimetric (areal) capacity of 514mAh g(-1) (0.47 mAh cm(-2)) at 100 mA g(-1) over 150 cycles and superior cycling stability with 99% capacity retention as well as good rate capability of similar to 150 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). Such outstanding electrochemical behaviors were attributed to the synergistic integration of both GF and PB components. Thus, the GF/PB system can be employed as potential superior binder-free anode candidates for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Preparation of 3D CeO2@NiFe-LDH composites derived from
   prussian blue analogues for high performance supercapacitors
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB In this paper, porous Fe-CeO2 with abundant oxygen vacancies was prepared by calcination of hexagonal bipyramidal prussian blue analogue (CeFe-PBA), and then CeO2@NiFe-LDH composite was synthesized by hydrothermal method. The morphology of the composite remain roughly cubic and biconical. The loading of LDH makes the surface of the cube grow abundant nanosheets. The synergistic effect of porous materials and nanosheets can improve the properties of the composites. The specific capacitance of the material is 516.524 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. At the same time, the capacitance retention can reach 83.442% after 5000 cycles. In particular, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) of CeO2@NiFe-LDH//AC have outstanding energy density (21.167 Wh kg-1) and high power density (7500 W kg-1).

TI Oriented Formation of a Prussian Blue Nanoflower as a High Performance
   Cathode for Sodium Ion Batteries
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Recently, the rational design and fabrication of Prussian blue (PB) cathodes with a unique morphology has been regarded as a promising way to improve the electrochemical properties for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the shape-controlled preparation of PB still remains challenging up to now. Herein, we demonstrate an oriented self-assembly strategy to synthesize PB with three-dimensional (3D) flowerlike structures for the first time, experimentally realizing control of the flower size. And the formation mechanism of the flower structure is investigated through density function theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that the resulting PB nanoflowers perform because of superior inherent properties, which can afford low Fe(CN)(6) vacancies and large specific surface areas. In addition, the special flowerlike PB exhibits superior rate capability (113 mAh g(-1) at 1600 mA g(-1)) and excellent cyclic stability (close to 80% capacity retention after 400 cycles at 800 mA g(-1)). The enhanced performance can be attributed to the flowerlike structure at the nanoscale, which can provide robust structural integrity, enlarge the contact area between electrode and electrolyte, and improve the apparent diffusion coefficient of Na+ ions. In addition, the flower structures can retain their parent structure when undergoing multiple charge-discharge cycles, further confirming the structural stability.

TI Bimetallic sulfide/N-doped carbon composite derived from Prussian blue
   analogues/cellulose nanofibers film toward enhanced oxygen evolution
   reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Exploiting effective, stable, and cost-efficient electrocatalysts for the water oxidation reaction is highly desirable for renewable energy conversion techniques. Constructional design and compositional manipulation are widely used approaches to efficaciously boost the electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we designed a NiFe-bimetallic sulfide/N-doped carbon composite via a two-step thermal treatment of Prussian blue analogues/cellulose nanofibers (PBA/CNFs) film. The NiFe-bimetallic sulfide/N-doped carbon composite displayed enhanced OER performance in an alkaline environment, with an overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a Tafel slope of 59.71 mV dec-1, and good stability, making the composite a candidate electrocatalyst for OER-related energy equipment. The introduction of CNFs in the precursor prevented the aggregation of PBA nanoparticles (NPs), exposed more active sites, and the resulting carbon substrate enhanced the electroconductivity of the composite. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Ni and Fe in the bimetallic sulfide could modulate the configuration of electrons, enrich the catalytically active sites, and augment the electric conductivity, thus ameliorating the OER performance. This study broadens the application of MOF-CNF composites to construct hierarchical structures of metal compounds and provides some thoughts for the development of cost-effective precious-metal-free catalysts for electrocatalysis.
   NiFe-bimetallic sulfide/N-doped carbon composite derived from NiFe-Prussian blue analogues/cellulose nanofibers film exhibited enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance.

TI Polydopamine coated prussian blue analogue derived hollow carbon
   nanoboxes with FeP encapsulated for hydrogen evolution
SO CARBON
AB Design of hollow carbon structure by using metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) precursors has come under the spotlight in electrochemical energy related applications due to its structure advantages. Here, a bimetal-based MOF (Zn and Fe) is adopted to synthesize hollow carbon nanobox with encapsulation of FeP nanoparticles. An unique core-shell architecture consisting of Zn-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) core and polydopamine shell is first synthesized, followed by pyrolysis-oxidation-phosphorization process to prepare monodispersed FeP nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow carbon nanobox (denoted as FeP/HCNB). Electrochemical hydrogen evolution activity is chosen to investigate the structure advantage of FeP/HCNB. It achieves overpotentials of -88 mV and -180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively, and continuous operation for 15 h (start at 20 mA cm(-2)). It is therefore expected that the synthetic strategy of nanobox would enlighten the preparation of various nano-structures for different applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are regarded as a subfamily of MOFs and possess great electrochemical characteristics, which are widely employed in energy and environmental applications. Benefiting from the merits of these two MOFs, we report a simple ion-exchange method to prepare ZIF-67/PBA heterostructure composites (abbreviated as ZP composites) with ZIF-67 and PBA as precursors. After low-temperature calcination, the structure converted into bimetallic N-doped dodecahedra that retained the structures of the ZP composites. The as-prepared ZP composites were utilized as electrode materials for supercapacitors that exhibited great rate capability and cycling stability. Furthermore, we assembled an asymmetric supercapacitor device with ZP composites and activated carbon. These results demonstrated that dual-MOF heterostructure composites showed great potential when applied as electrode materials.

TI Prussian blue analogue derived NiCoSe4 coupling with nitrogen-doped
   carbon nanofibers for pseudocapacitive electrodes
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB The design of pseudocapacitive materials by coupling transition metal compounds with a conductive car-bon matrix is important for the high performance of supercapacitors. Herein, we construct the Prussian blue analogue derived nickel-cobalt selenides coupling with nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NiCoSe4 -NCNFs) by carbonization and selenization of polyacrylonitrile nanofibers. The effect of selenization and el-ement N doping on the morphological structure and surface chemistry of NiCoSe4-NCNFs are evaluated. Due to the accelerated electrolyte ion diffusion, enlarged active surface area and the modified surface chemistry by the strong interaction at NiCoSe4/NCNFs interfaces, NiCoSe4-NCNFs show excellent capaci-tive behaviors in 1 mol/L KOH, and the specific capacitance is 1257 F/g at 1 A/g with a rate capability of 78% and cyclic stability of 82.9%. The Gibbs free energy of adsorption OH- is calculated by density func-tional theory to investigate the charge storage mechanism. This work offers a new strategy to construct the transition metal selenides/carbon nanofibers hybrids for high-performance supercapacitor devices.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

TI Mo/Fe bimetallic pyrophosphates derived from Prussian blue analogues for
   rapid electrocatalytic oxygen evolution
SO GREEN ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT
AB Efficient and stable oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are indispensable for industrial applications of water splitting and hydrogen production. Herein, a simple and practical method was applied to fabricate (Mo, Fe)P2O7@NF electrocatalyst by directly growing Mo/Fe bimetallic pyrophosphate derived from Prussian blue analogues on three-dimensional porous current collector. In alkaline media, the developed material possesses good hydrophilic features and exhibits best-in-class oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances. Surprisingly, the (Mo, Fe) P2O7@NF only requires overpotentials of 250 and 290 mV to deliver 100 and 600 mA cm-2 in 1 mol L-1 KOH, respectively. Furthermore, the (Mo, Fe)P2O7@NF shows outstanding performances in alkaline salty water and 1 mol L-1 high purity KOH. A worthwhile pathway is provided to combine bimetallic pyrophosphate with commercial Ni foam to form robust electrocatalysts for stable electrocatalytic OER, which has a positive impact on both hydrogen energy application and environmental restoration.& COPY; 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI Prussian Blue nanoparticles: An FDA-approved substance that may quickly
   degrade at physiological pH
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES
AB Prussian blue (PB) is a coordination polymer based on the Fe2+...C---N...Fe3+ sequence. It is an FDA-approved drug, intended for oral use at the acidic pH of the stomach and of most of the intestine track. However, based on FDA approval, a huge number of papers proposed the use of PB nanoparticles (PBnp) under "physiological conditions", meaning pH buffered at 7.4 and high saline concentration. While most of these papers report that PBnp are stable at this pH, a small number of papers describes instead PBnp degradation at the same or similar pH values, i.e. in the 7-8 range. Here we give a definitively clear picture: PBnp are intrinsically unstable at pH & GE; 7, degrading with the fast disappearance of their 700 nm absorption band, due to the formation of OH- complexes from the labile Fe3+ centers. However, we show also that the presence of a polymeric coating (PVP) can protect PBnp at pH 7.4 for over 24 h. Moreover, we demonstrate that when "physiological conditions" include serum, a protein corona is rapidly formed on PBnp, efficiently avoiding degradation. We also show that the viability of PBnp-treated EA.hy926, NCI-H1299, and A549 cells is not affected in a wide range of conditions that either prevent or promote PBnp degradation.

TI Scalable Preparation of Mn/Ni Binary Prussian Blue as Sustainable
   Cathode for Harsh-Condition-Tolerant Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Manganese-based Prussian blue has attracted enormous interest because of its high energy density, low cost, and easy synthesis. However, its practical use is limited for its poor rate capability and cycling performance. Here, a Mn/Ni binary Prussian blue was proposed to address this issue. The material with a 1:1 Mn/Ni ratio shows an optimized electrochemical performance when prepared via a Na2C2O4-assisted coprecipitation route at a high precursor salt concentration (0.5 mol L-1, named Mn0.5Ni0.5-0.5). Mn0.5Ni0.5-0.5 delivers a relatively high capacity of 69.4 mAh g(-1) even at a current density rate up to 100 C (69% relative to 0.1 C) and a long cycle life with 85.3% capacity retained after 700 cycles at 5 C. The material functions well at both -20 and 45 degrees C at 1 C. Stable cycling can be realized after overcharge to 4.8 V (91.8%, 300 cycles at 1 C) and overdischarge to 1.2 V (89.7%, 300 cycles at 1 C). In addition, the coin cell group assembled by series/parallel-connected single cells also shows excellent cycling performance without any battery management system. A scalable preparation of kilogram-grade Mn0.5Ni0.5-0.5 is achieved, and the pouch-type full cell made from it also exhibits stable cycling.

TI Intercalated Cation Disorder in Prussian Blue Analogues:
   First-Principles and Grand Canonical Analyses
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) are a promising class of intercalation materials for electrochemical energy storage and water treatment, and intercalated cation disorder within them results from partial cation occupation within their vacant interstitial sites. In this study, we investigate the influence of intercalated cation ordering on the electrochemical equilibrium of PBAs. First-principles calculations were performed for supercell configurations with two distinct arrangements of cations, vacancy-pair configurations, and vacancy-pair free (VPF) configurations (VPFCs), to analyze the energetic and electronic structure differences between them. VPFCs were found to be thermodynamically favored at 300 K. The energetic cost of vacancy-pair formation was also attributed to charge sharing between cations and surrounding atoms. Using these findings, a vacancy-pair free (VPF) model was then constructed based on grand canonical ensemble (GCE) theory to predict the composition-dependent equilibrium potential for intercalation into sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate Na1+xNiFe(CN)(6). Close agreement with experiment indicates the critical role of cation ordering in PBAs at equilibrium. In this GCE analysis, a hybrid Markov method was used to sample VPFCs at various x, showing two distinct patterns of cation/vacancy ordering. Finally, the VPF model was compared to a noninteracting solution (NIS). The failure of the NIS to predict potential at a low degree of intercalation further confirms that cation/vacancy ordering is essential to electrochemical equilibria in PBAs.

TI Effect of Cations on the Electrochemical Properties of Insertion
   Reactions Using Prussian Blue Analogues
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The increased interest in post-lithium-ionbatteries(post-LIBs)in recent years has prompted the investigation of insertion materialscontaining various cations. The electrochemical properties of cationinsertion reactions greatly influence the performance of post-LIBs.However, the relationship between these properties and the insertedcations has not been evaluated. In this study, we investigated theeffect of inserted cations on the electrochemical properties of insertionreactions using Prussian blue analogues as the electrode material.The insertion reactions of mono-, di-, and trivalent cations exhibiteda maximum potential difference of 200 mV, which correlated to thecation ionic radius. The rate capabilities corresponding to monovalentcations greatly depended on the ionic radius, while those of divalentand trivalent cations were similar for all tested ionic radii. Formonovalent cation insertion reactions, the rate capability variedparabolically with the ionic radius, reaching a maximum at 1.3 & ANGS;.Furthermore, the rate capability decreased with increasing cationvalency. The evaluation of the relationship between the electrochemicalproperties such as electrode potentials and rate capabilities andthe cation valency and ionic radius in insertion reactions allowsus to understand the electrochemical nature of this reaction and providesimportant information for the development of post-LIBs.

TI Role of Acid in Tailoring Prussian Blue as Cathode for High-Performance
   Sodium-Ion Battery
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue (PB) with concave centers is synthesized successfully through a hydrothermal method with the assistance of acid. In this study, the role of the acid is investigated systematically by adjusting the reaction temperature and time, using different kinds and amounts of acid, and changing the amount of PVP surfactant added. It is found that the acid can not only trigger the chemical reaction to form cubic PB, but also act as an etching reagent to tailor the morphology. The as-obtained cubic PB with concave centers demonstrates a superior cycle stability and rate performance, which can achieve a capacity of 107 mA hg(-1) at 0.2 Ag-1. The corresponding capacity retention is 74% after 500 cycles relative to the second cycle. Even at a current density of 5 Ag-1, the specific capacity remains at 82 mA hg(-1). Furthermore, the full cell, using PB as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode, exhibits a high capacity of 70 mA hg(-1) at 0.1 Ag-1, and can power an LED light successfully. This work provides new insights into the role of acid in tailoring the morphology of PB, and opens a new avenue toward the design of unique structures to improve sodium storage.

TI Synchronous crystal growth and etching optimization of Prussian blue
   from a single iron-source as high-rate cathode for sodium-ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have been considered as promising cathodes for room temperature sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their rigid open framework and low-cost synthesis. Herein, we have synthesized slight-etching PB cubes with low amounts of coordinated water and [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies using an optimized hydrothermal method with the aid of acid. Interestingly, synchronous crystal growth and etching processes are observed, accompanied by recrystallization behaviors during the etching process. With the increasing acid amount, yield of the as-prepared PB improves greatly. The acid etching mechanism is further clarified. Notably, such one-step acid-etching hydrothermal approach can realize the rational composition and architecture design of PB. The correlation between physical properties and cell performance of PB is systematically investigated. The optimized PB cubes with slight surface etching deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 99 mA h g(-1), a capacity retention of 79% for 500 cycles and 74 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 1500 mA g(-1). Such superior rate capability and long cycle life are ascribed to the synergistic effects of the structure and morphology of PB, which possesses low amounts of coordinated water and [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies, large unit cell volume, and slight-etching surface in the cubic structure, good crystallinity and uniform particle size distribution.

TI Strain engineering of photo-induced phase transformations in Prussian
   blue analogue heterostructures
SO NANOSCALE
AB Heterostructures based on Prussian blue analogues (PBA) combining photo- and magneto-striction have shown a large potential for the development of light-induced magnetization switching. However, studies of the microscopic parameters that control the transfer of the mechanical stresses across the interface and their propagation in the magnetic material are still too scarce to efficiently improve the elastic coupling. Here, this coupling strength is tentatively controlled by strain engineering in heteroepitaxial PBA core-shell heterostructures involving the same Rb0.5Co[Fe(CN)(6)](0.8)center dot zH(2)O photostrictive core and isostructural shells of similar thickness and variable mismatch with the core lattice. The shell deformation and the optical electron transfer at the origin of photostriction are monitored by combined in situ and real time synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy under visible light irradiation. These experiments show that rather large strains, up to +0.9%, are developed within the shell in response to the tensile stresses associated with the expansion of the core lattice upon illumination. The shell behavior is, however, complex, with contributions in dilatation, in compression or unchanged. We show that a tailored photo-response in terms of strain amplitude and kinetics with potential applications for a magnetic manipulation using light requires a trade-off between the quality of the interface (which needs a small lattice mismatch i.e. a small a-cubic parameter for the shell) and the shell rigidity (decreased for a large a-parameter). A shell with a high compressibility that is further increased by the presence of misfit dislocations will show a decrease in its mechanical retroaction on the photo-switching properties of the core particles.

TI Reversible structural evolution of sodium-rich rhombohedral Prussian
   blue for sodium-ion batteries
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Iron-based Prussian blue analogs are promising low-cost and easily prepared cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Their materials quality and electrochemical performance are heavily reliant on the precipitation process. Here we report a controllable precipitation method to synthesize high-performance Prussian blue for sodium-ion storage. Characterization of the nucleation and evolution processes of the highly crystalline Prussian blue microcubes reveals a rhombohedral structure that exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency, excellent rate performance, and cycling properties. The phase transitions in the as-obtained material are investigated by synchrotron in situ powder X-ray diffraction, which shows highly reversible structural transformations between rhombohedral, cubic, and tetragonal structures upon sodium-ion (de)intercalations. Moreover, the Prussian blue material from a large-scale synthesis process shows stable cycling performance in a pouch full cell over 1000 times. We believe that this work could pave the way for the real application of Prussian blue materials in sodium-ion batteries.
   Here the authors deploy a scalable synthesis route to prepare sodium-rich Na2-xFeFe(CN)(6) cathode materials for sodium-ion battery. The highly reversible structural evolution during cycling between rhombohedral, cubic and tetragonal phases is the key to enable the good performance.

TI A polyaniline-coated Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue nanocube-modified
   separator for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have gained significant attention as promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, their commercialization has been limited due to serious polysulfide dissolution. Herein, we synthesized polyaniline-coated Ni-Co Prussian blue nanocubes (NCP@PANi) for Li-S battery separator modification using a simple coprecipitation and in situ oxidation polymerization method. The synergistic catalytic effect of Ni and Co bimetallics enhanced the cathodic reaction kinetics. In addition, the coating of PANi on the NCP surface further improved the electrical conductivity and adsorption of polysulfides. The sulfur/ketjen black cathode (S/KB) using the modified separator exhibited an initial discharge specific capacity of 1443.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1C. Even at a high sulfur loading of 3.1 mg cm-2, it exhibited an initial capacity of 713.9 mA h g-1 at 0.5C and maintained 431.3 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles. Overall, the NCP@PANi modified separator effectively inhibited the polysulfide shuttling and thus improved the electrochemical performance. This study provides valuable insights into separator modification for Li-S batteries.
   A PANi-coated Ni-Co-based Prussian blue analogue (NCP@PANi) was synthesized through a simple coprecipitation and in situ oxidation polymerization method. The NCP@PANi-modified separators can inhibit the polysulfide shuttling effectively.

TI Surfactant stabilization of vanadium iron oxide derived from Prussian
   blue analog for lithium-ion battery electrodes
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB Due to their high energy density, Li-ion batteries have become indispensable for energy storage in many technical devices. Prussian blue and its analogs are a versatile family of materials. Apart from their direct use as an alkali-ion battery electrode, they are a promising source for templating other compounds due to the presence of carbon, nitrogen, and metallic elements in their structure, ease of synthesis, and high tunability. In this study, homogeneous iron vanadate derivatization from iron vanadium Prussian blue was successfully carried out using an energy efficient infrared furnace utilizing CO2 gas. Iron-vanadate is an inherently unstable electrode material if cycled at low potentials vs. Li/Li+. Several parameters were optimized to achieve a stable electrochemical performance of this derivative, and the effect of surfactants, such as tannic acid, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, and polyvinylpyrrolidone were shown with their role in the morphology and electrochemical performance. While stabilizing the performance, we demonstrate that the type and order of addition of these surfactants are fundamental for a successful coating formation, otherwise they can hinder the formation of PBA, which has not been reported previously. Step-by-step, we illustrate how to prepare self-standing electrodes for Li-ion battery cells without using an organic solvent or a fluorine-containing binder while stabilizing the electrochemical performance. A 400 mA h g(-1) capacity at the specific current of 250 mA g(-1) was achieved after 150 cycles while maintaining a Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% over an extended potential range of 0.01-3.50 V vs. Li/Li+.

TI Ferrocyanide-Surface Ligands to Quantum Dots for Prussian Blue
   Composites Showing Efficient and Reversible Electrochemical Response
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB We employed a novel approach to fabricate quantum dot-in-Prussian blue analogue (QD-in-PBA) composites, encapsulating colloidal QDs into the electrical conducting metal organic framework PBA, which could provide a robust platform for efficient photochemical modulation of photoluminescence (PL) intensity. To achieve this, the surface of the QDs was engineered by attaching ferrocyanide ligands. This surface modification enabled the QDs to be seamlessly and uniformly incorporated into the PBA matrix. The ferrocyanide ligands on the QD surfaces played a pivotal role in initiating the in-situ formation of PBA, facilitated by the introduction of additional ferrocyanide ions and iron (III) ions as the building blocks of PBA. Alternatively applied external voltages to the QD-in-PBA electrode within an electrochemical cell demonstrated the reversible quenching and recovery of the PL intensity of the QDs embedded within the QD-in-PBA composite. Notably, we achieved the on/off modulation ratio over 7, which could be consistently repeated across multiple cycles. In contrast, the control sample, comprising a mixture of QDs and PBA, exhibited poor stability in terms of electrochemical performance, with a reduced modulation degree observed over repeating cycles. This diminished stability can be attributed to the fact that in the control sample, the QDs were merely attached to the surface of the PBA rather than being fully incorporated within the matrix and became redispersed into the electrolyte solution during the electrochemical reactions.

SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB Thin films of iron-filled carbon nanotubes prepared through the liquid/liquid interfacial method were modified with a mixture of hexacyanometallates (HCMs) Prussian blue and ruthenium purple. Two different approaches were used in order to obtain both materials in the composites, based on a direct reaction starting from a mixture of both precursors or a step-by-step deposition of each compound. The modified films were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, confirming the formation of a mixture of HCMs in both methods of synthesis. Stability studies were evaluated in different supporting electrolytes, and composites presented good performances due to carbon nanotube stabilization. Electrochromic properties were also evaluated for selected composites, showing high electrochromic efficiency and stability.

TI High-pressure neutron scattering of the magnetoelastic Ni-Cr Prussian
   blue analog
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB This paper summarizes 0 to 0.6 GPa neutron diffraction measurements of a nickel hexacyanochromate coordination polymer (NiCrPB) that has the face-centered-cubic, Prussian blue structure. Deuterated powders of NiCrPB contain approximate to 100-nm-sided cubic particles. The application of a large magnetic field shows the ambient-pressure, saturated magnetic structure. Pressures of less than 1 GPa have previously been shown to decrease the magnetic susceptibility by as much as half, and we find modifications to the nuclear crystal structure at these pressures that we quantify. Bridging cyanide molecules isomerize their coordination direction under pressure to change the local ligand field and introduce inhomogeneities in the local (magnetic) anisotropy that act as pinning sites for magnetic domains, thereby reducing the low-field magnetic susceptibility.

TI Bimetal Prussian Blue as a Continuously Variable Platform for
   Investigating the Composition-Activity Relationship of Phosphides-Based
   Electrocatalysts for Water Oxidation
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Doping unary transition-metal phosphides (TMPs) by secondary metal is a powerful method to improve their catalytic activity for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the composition-activity relationship of such doping has not been systematically investigated yet because of the challenge in constructing bimetal TMPs with continuously variable composition while keeping homogenous elemental distribution. Herein, we develop a strategy of using bimetal Prussian blue analogues with homogenous elemental distribution at molecular scale as an ideal platform to achieve bimetal cobalt-iron phosphides (Co1-xFexP) with a continuously changeable Co/Fe ratio (0 < x < 1) and uniform metal distribution. Such a system allows us to draw out a composition-activity volcano profile of Co1-xFexP for OER. By optimizing the composition, the best catalytic activity is obtained at the Co/Fe ratio of 1.63 in Co1-xFexP with small overpotentials of 230 and 268 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which outperform most of the reported TMPs. These results may inspire the use of multicomponent molecular platforms to understand composition-dependent performance and explore highly efficient catalysts for diverse applications.

We present here the transformation of the Co4.Fe.CN) 6] 2.7 Prussian blue analogue (PBA) into the mixed Co1.8Fe1.2O4 spinel oxide, with a detailed characterization of the final phase (obtained by calcination in air at 900 degrees C for 2 hours) and an emphasis on the calcination process by TDA/ TGA, X-ray diffraction, (high-resolution) TEM and energy-filtered TEM. Single-crystalline particles with a homogeneous distribution of Fe and Co ions within each particle are observed, with the same Co: Fe ratio as in the PBA. The calcination mechanism is a 2-step transformation, with first the elimination of water molecules and then the cyanide decomposition. XRD and TEM at intermediate temperatures additionally show the occurrence of a phase separation between 500 degrees C and 850 degrees C before the formation of the single final phase. We demonstrate also through the calcination of intermediate PBAs between Co4.Fe.CN) 6] 2.7 and Co4.Co.CN) 6] 2.7 that this synthesis route leads to the perfect control of the oxide stoichiometry through control of the PBA. The versatility of this synthesis route is finally illustrated through the successful synthesis of Co1.8Fe1.2O4 nanoparticles (diameter 5 nm) from PBA nanoparticles confined within the pores of a mesoporous silica monolith.

TI Photoinduced effects on the magnetic properties of the ( Fe0.2Cr0.8)
   1.5[ Cr( CN) 6] Prussian blue analogue
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB One of the most attractive characteristics of some Prussian blue derivatives is the sensitivity of their magnetic properties to the irradiation with light. In this work photoinduced effects in the (Fe0.2Cr0.8)(1.5)[Cr(CN)(6)]15H(2)O PBA have been studied by means of X-ray-based spectroscopies and magnetometry. It is found that the photosensitivity of this compound is mostly centred on the Fe cations: the exposure to green light induces a transfer of electrons from them to the Cr that provokes a reversal of the previously existing linkage isomerization and increases the elastic strain caused by the misfit of the unit cells of the Fe-NC-Cr and Cr-NC-Cr sublattices. The green light also quenches the magnetism of the Fe-II high-spin (HS) ions present in the sample and reduces the magnetic moments of most of the Cr cations except for Cr-II HS. Our study highlights the important role played by the mismatch between the unit cells of the coexisting sub-lattices in ternary Prussian blue analogues.

TI Prussian Blue@Polyacrylic Acid/Au Aggregate Janus Nanoparticles for CT
   Imaging-guided Chemotherapy and Enhanced Photothermal Therapy
SO ADVANCED THERAPEUTICS
AB Janus nanoparticles (JNPs) have been widely researched for numerous biomedical applications. However, few studies have integrated enhanced photothermal therapy, effective chemotherapy, and diagnostic imaging in a single nanoplatform. Here, unique Prussian blue@polyacrylic acid/Au aggregate JNPs (PB@PAA/Au-A JNPs) are prepared by a facile and mild method. The exposed surfaces in the JNPs maintain and utilize the original photothermal properties of the PB and Au domains. A heterostructure also adds the functionality of drug loading, which cannot be realized in a common core-shell structure. Notably, the coupling effect of two distinct PB and Au-A domains leads to a superior photothermal conversion efficiency (eta) of 49.4%, which is 9.9% higher than that of PB NPs. Synthesized doxorubicin-loaded PB@PAA/Au-A JNPs (DOX-loaded PB@PAA/Au-A JNPs) can be applied to computed tomography imaging-guided chemotherapy and enhanced photothermal therapy, collectively promoting tumor inhibition.

   changes of Prussian blue analogs
   K0.4Co1.3[Fe(CN)6]•nH2O
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The K0.4Co1.3[Fe(CN)6]center dot nH2O samples were prepared by co-precipitation method. Powder X-ray diffraction showed that only one HT phase existed in the sample prepared at room temperature ([KCoFe]RT). When the preparation temperature rises to 80 degrees C([KCoFe]80 degrees C), the diffraction peak intensity of primary HT phase weakened and another LT phase appeared. The HT and LT phase are both FCC crystal structure with structural parameters of 10.23 angstrom and 9.93 angstrom, respectively. Infrared and Mo center dot ssbauer spectra indicated that part of FeIIILS-CN-CoIIHS were transformed to FeII LS-CN-CoIII LS configuration when preparation temperature rises to 80 degrees C. It indicated that preparation temperature induced charge transfer from CoII to FeIII ions occurred in present sample. Magnetic analysis showed that these cobalt iron cyanides are both ferrimagnetic. The difference of magnetic moments between the two compounds over the entire temperature range is ascribed to the fact that [KCoFe]RT has more paramagnetic central ions than [KCoFe]80 degrees C. The difference between room temperature theoretical and experimental magnetic moments may be attributed to the weak spin-orbit coupling existing for both ions.

SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB In this study, the electronic state of RbMn[Fe(CN)6], a type of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), was reported using Xray absorption spectroscopy, focusing on the K absorption edge of Mn. It is known that many PBAs exhibit a first-order phase transition when the temperature changes, however interestingly, the present experimental results show that the spectrum of the Mn K-edge does not exhibit a simple first-order phase transition. This result indicates the possibility of unraveling the previously unclear phase relationship between the electronic and crystal structures of PBAs and their complex physical properties.

TI Divalent Oxidation State Ni as an Active Intermediate in Prussian Blue
   Analogues for Electrocatalytic Urea Oxidation
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Urea degradation is one of the most crucial links in the natural nitrogen cycle. Exploring the real active species in the urea electro-oxidation process is of great significance for understanding the urea electro-oxidation mechanism and designing catalysts. A highly active and stable Prussian blue analogue catalyst (PBA@NiFe/NF) loaded on nickel foam was synthesized for electro-oxidation of urea. In situ Raman spectra revealed that Ni in PBA@NiFe/NF was able to maintain a stable divalent nickel (Ni(II)) state for up to 3.5 h during the initial urea oxidation process, which is rarely reported in previous research studies. In addition, with the participation of iron, the Ni-Fe bimetallic center significantly improves the electro-oxidation of urea. Our work provides a new idea for prolonging the Ni(II) activity in electrocatalytic oxidation of urea.

TI Structure and excellent visible light catalysis of Prussian blue
   analogues BiFe(CN)6•4H2O
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Photo-Fenton catalysis with high-efficiency is required for the resolution of environmental pollution. Here, the Prussian blue analogue BiFe(CN)(6)center dot 4H(2)O with a narrow bandgap (1.63 eV) shows excellent visible light catalysis to decompose organic dyes and tetracycline. The microrod and nanoplate morphologies were successfully synthesized by simple precipitation with different additives. The nanoplates of BiFe (CN)(6)center dot 4H(2)O show excellent phono-Fenton catalytic activity meaning that RhB can be decomposed within 6 min in the presence of H2O2. BiFe(CN)(6)center dot 4H(2)O exhibits a layered structure, which consists of FeC6 and BiN6 coordination polyhedra. The zero field cooling indicated that BiFe(CN)(6)center dot 4H(2)O has an anti-ferromagnetic order at low temperatures. Furthermore, the stability of the BiFe(CN)(6)center dot 4H(2)O catalyst is very good, which has been investigated by various characterizations. The mechanism of the excellent catalysis is related to the crucial role of H2O2, which inhibits the recombination of the electron-hole pair and drives the photo-Fenton reaction. Therefore, to treat the wastewater by photo-Fenton catalysis, the present component of BiFe(CN)(6)center dot 4H(2)O is a promising catalyst candidate.

TI Uncovering the Interplay of Competing Distortions in the Prussian Blue
   Analogue K2Cu[Fe(CN)6]
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB We report the synthesis, crystal structure, thermal response, and electrochemical behavior of the Prussian blue analogue (PBA) K2Cu[Fe(CN)(6)]. From a structural perspective, this is the most complex PBA yet characterized: its triclinic crystal structure results from an interplay of cooperative Jahn-Teller order, octahedral tilts, and a collective "slide" distortion involving K-ion displacements. These different distortions give rise to two crystallographically distinct K-ion channels with different mobilities. Variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction measurements show that K-ion slides are the lowest-energy distortion mechanism at play, as they are the only distortion to be switched off with increasing temperature. Electrochemically, the material operates as a K-ion cathode with a high operating voltage and an improved initial capacity relative to higher-vacancy PBA alternatives. On charging, K+ ions are selectively removed from a single K-ion channel type, and the slide distortions are again switched on and off accordingly. We discuss the functional importance of various aspects of structural complexity in this system, placing our discussion in the context of other related PBAs.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB We studied the transient electron-transfer process in CsCoFe and RbMnFe Prussian Blue analogues by time-resolved X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and by time-resolved optical spectroscopy. We performed time-resolved studies on CsCoFe nanocrystals dispersed in solution. The XANES results obtained at room temperature clearly evidence Co-III(low spin)Fe-II -> Co-II(high spin)Fe-III electron transfer between the metal centers through opposite spectral shifts at the Fe and Co edges. We also studied the Mn-III( low spin)Fe-II -> Mn-II(high spin)Fe-III process in an RbMnFe powder sample at thermal equilibrium and under laser excitation. Optical spectroscopy revealed that the process occurs on the picosecond timescale, as already reported by Raman spectroscopy, and that the lifetime of the photoinduced charge-transfer states is in the 1-10 mu s range, depending on the sample and temperature.

AB Removal of organic pollutants with green and efficient methods is an important goal for researchers studying environmental pollution. Photo-Fenton systems with composite catalysts are a promising alternative for efficient water treatment. In this study, Prussian blue modified magnetite decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MW-CNT) nanocomposite was prepared and for the first time applied to the Photo-Fenton degradation of phenol. The catalyst was prepared by rapid hydrothermal method. XPS, SEM-EDX, XRD, FTIR, UV-Vis-NIR, EIS techniques were used for characterizing the functionalities and morphology of the catalyst. The effect of initial H2O2 concentration, catalyst mass, and initial pH of the phenol solution was investigated. Experimental results showed that 100 mg dm-3 of phenol could be degraded completely in 15 min at pH 7. This study describes the synthesis of the new Photo-Fenton catalyst for highly effective phenol treatment.

TI N-doped bimetallic NiFeP nanocubic clusters derived from Prussian blue
   analogues as a high-efficiency and durable water splitting
   electrocatalyst
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The design and preparation of high-efficiency and durable non-precious metal electrocatalysts are critical to the realization of large-scale water splitting. In this work, nano cubic clusters of Ni and Fe bimetallic phos-phides (NiFeP@NC/NF) grown on NF substrates were synthesized through a simple secondary hydrothermal reaction and low-temperature phosphating. By exploring the phosphating temperature, the optimized NiFeP@NC/NF material shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. It has a small initial overpotential of 286 and 242 mV and low Tafel slope of 69 and 126 mV dec(-1 )at current density of 20 mA cm(-2), which is attributed to the synergistic effect of NC@ NiFeP nanocubic clusters and NF framework, NiFeP@NC nanocubic clusters not only provide more active specific surface area but also the interlaced structure is more stable. The introduction of miscella-neous elements can accelerate the mass transfer in the reaction. The results show that NiFeP@NC/NF is an excellent dual-function electrocatalyst for water splitting and a promising candidate for electrocatalytic water splitting.

TI A Prussian blue analogue as a long-life cathode for liquid-state and
   solid-state sodium-ion batteries
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as a kind of promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted much attention due to their low price and open three-dimensional (3D) channel structure. Here, a facile wet-chemical method is used to synthesize a nano-sized NiFe-PBA compound. The as-synthesized NiFe-PBA not only exhibits good structural stability but also demonstrates impressive electrochemical performance when it is used as a cathode in SIBs. Both liquid-state and solid-state sodium-ion batteries (SSIBs) demonstrate excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 85.8% and 86.7%, respectively, after 1120 cycles.

TI High-pressure behaviour of Prussian blue analogues: interplay of
   hydration, Jahn-Teller distortions and vacancies
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB We report a high-pressure crystallographic study of four hydrated Prussian blue analogues: M[Pt(CN)(6)] and M[Co(CN)(6)](0.67) (M = Mn2+, Cu2+) in the range 0-3 GPa. Mn[Co(CN)(6)](0.67) was studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, whereas the other systems were only available in polycrystalline form. The Mn-containing compounds undergo pressure-induced phase transitions from Fm (3) over barm to R (3) over bar at similar to 1.0-1.5 GPa driven by cooperative tilting of the octahedral units. No phase transition was found for the orbitally disordered Cu[Co(CN)(6)](0.67) up to 3 GPa. Mn[Co(CN)(6)](0.67) is significantly softer than the other samples, with a bulk modulus of similar to 14 GPa compared to similar to 35 GPa of the powdered samples. The discrepant pressure responses are discussed in terms of the presence of structural defects, Jahn-Teller distortions, and hydration. The implications for the development of polar systems are reviewed based upon our high-pressure study.

TI Leveraging Entropy and Crystal Structure Engineering in Prussian Blue
   Analogue Cathodes for Advancing Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS NANO
AB The synergistic engineering of chemical complexity and crystal structures has been applied to Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes in this work. More precisely, the high-entropy concept has been successfully introduced into two structure types of identical composition, namely, cubic and monoclinic. Through the utilization of a variety of complementary characterization techniques, a comprehensive investigation into the electrochemical behavior of the cubic and monoclinic PBAs has been conducted, providing nuanced insights. The implementation of the high-entropy concept exhibits crucial selectivity toward the intrinsic crystal structure. Specifically, while the overall cycling stability of both cathode systems is significantly improved, the synergistic interplay of crystal structure engineering and entropy proves particularly significant. After optimization, the cubic PBA demonstrates structural advantages, showcasing good reversibility, minimal capacity loss, high thermal stability, and unparalleled endurance even under harsh conditions (high specific current and temperature).

TI Crucial structural effects of porous Co3O4 derived
   from Prussian blue analogue on the enhanced gas sensing performance
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Recently, porous metal oxides derived from MOF (metal-organic framework) has been reported to have outstanding gas sensing performance. However, how and why the structures derived from MOF promote the properties need a further research. Herein, porous Co3O4 was synthesized by calcining Prussian blue analogue (PBA, a typical MOF material) cubes. As-prepared Co3O4 has a porous cubic structure and shows a high response to n-butanol. By comparing with the smashed sample, it is found that the hierarchical structure of initial Co3O4 derived from PBA templates contributes to the enhanced gas sensing performance. It is because that the special porous structure is beneficial for the diffusion of n-butanol deep inside the sensing layer. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cs sorption of Mn-Fe based Prussian blue analogs with periodic
   precipitation banding in agarose gel
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We report the understanding of Cs sorption/desorption properties of Mn-Fe based Prussian blue analogs (Mn-Fe PBA) and Prussian blue (PB) in agarose gel via X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. After contacting a 2 mass% agarose gel containing 100 mmol dm(-3) [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions (inner electrolyte gel) with a 1 mass% agarose gel containing 550 mmol dm(-3) Mn2+ or Fe2+ ions (outer electrolyte gel) in a plastic straw for 11 days, the clipped 10 mm-long gel columns of uniformly formed precipitates (named "Mn-Fe PBA gel" and "PB gel") were used to investigate their Cs sorption/desorption properties. The Mn-Fe PBA gel showed several interesting features that were not observed in the PB gel. The Cs sorption capacity of the Mn-Fe PBA gel increased over time, and after similar to 1200 h reached a value comparable to the most optimal values previously reported. During Cs sorption, Mn2+ ions were constantly released from the Mn-Fe PBA gel, and several periodic precipitation bands were generated. The positions of the periodic bands agreed with those of the peak distributions of Cs, Mn, and Fe, suggesting that the concentration fluctuation of Mn-II-Fe-III PBA in the gel resulted in the periodic band formation. In these bands, large crystallites (>10 mu m) were dominant, suggesting the contribution of Ostwald ripening. During Cs desorption, while Mn2+ ions were released from the Mn-Fe PBA gel, the release of Cs+ ions was considerably suppressed (similar to 1/3 for the PB gel). Based on these results, a model for Cs sorption by the Mn-Fe PBA gel was proposed, and its potential applications were discussed.

TI Organic Solvothermal Method Promoted Monoclinic Prussian Blue as a
   Superior Cathode for Na-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Prussian blue (PB) is recognized as a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its rigid open framework and low cost. The electrochemical performance of PB is largely determined by the lattice structure, which is greatly affected by the preparation process. Herein, an organic-based solvothermal strategy is developed to prepare monoclinic PB (M-PB). During the solvothermal process, ethylene glycol not only acts as a natural insulating layer to hinder the contact of Fe-II and [Fe(CN)(6)](4-), further slowing the crystal growth process, but also functions as a mild reducing agent to prevent Fe-II from oxidizing, leading to a stable lattice structure. The critical effects of the water/glycol ratio, reaction temperature, and reaction time on the growth of PB are investigated in detail. Benefiting from the stable structure and limited lattice defects, the M-PB exhibits much improved Na+-ion storage performance. Furthermore, the storage mechanism behind the electrochemical process is revealed. This study highlights the importance of the preparation process to the material structure and hence its electrochemical performance, which provides the insight into the rational design of PB-based cathode materials.

TI Double-Shell Carbon-Coated CoFe Alloy Nanoparticles Derived From
   Dopamine-Coated Prussian Blue Analogues for High-Efficiency
   Lithium-Sulfur Batteries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB In this study, we applied polydopamine (PDA) to the surface of the CoFe-PBA nanocube and named it CoFe-PBA@PDA. Subsequently, we calcinated the CoFe-PBA@PDA nanocube at 500 degrees C for 3 h to obtain a double-shell carbon-coated CoFe nanoparticle (CoFe@C). Finally, we synthesized the CoFe@C/S composite material by diffusing sulfur into the host material, which is commonly used as a cathode material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Through chemisorption, polysulfides were captured by CoFe nanoparticles, and the electronic linkage between different components increased. The CoFe@C/S material had a high sulfur content (59%) and a capacity of up to 568.6 mAhg(-1) after 100-time cycles at 0.1 C. Also, it could maintain a capacity of 311.1 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. The results showed that the designed composite material could significantly increase the electrochemical property of Li-S batteries.

TI A superior sodium-ion battery based on tubular Prussian blue cathode and
   its derived phosphide anode
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Sodium-ion batteries are receiving incremental attention as a promising alternative of the commercial lithium-ion batteries. However, it remains a challenging task to fully explore suitable cathode and anode materials for assembling a full cell with attractive Na-ion storage properties. Herein, we demonstrate a superior sodium-ion battery by pairing a tubular Prussian blue (PB) cathode and its derived phosphide anode. The tubular configuration endows the PB with fast reaction kinetics and thus delivers a large specific capacity of 94.4 mAh g(-1) even at a high rate of 5.0 A g(-1). The PB-derived phosphide is featured by encapsulation of FeP nanoparticles into a conductive carbon matrix, which enables remarkable sodium energy storage likewise. Impressively, the as-assembled sodium-ion full cell exhibits an unprecedented capacity of 105.3 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 A g(-1) and good cycling lifespan. The present study offers a homologous design strategy based on PB and its derivatives for constructing outstanding sodium-ion full cells.

TI Cyanido-Bridged Heterobimetallic Molecular Squares: Low- Dimensional
   Models of Prussian Blue Analogues and Beyond
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB The cyanido-bridged square-like molecules with d/f metal ions occupying the corners of the square are considered molecular models of the Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) because they reproduce one face of their 3D face-centered cubic structure, being called low-dimensional PBAs. Such highly regular complexes provide unique insights into the short-range magnetic exchange interaction between the metal ions of PBAs and exhibit magnetic properties which are not found for PBAs. This review focuses on the preparative routes and magneto-structural characterization of d- d(d ')/d-f tetranuclears with a square-like topology generating rich families of molecular switches and nanomagnets. Relevant examples that provided a better comprehension of the magnetic behavior of PBAs, including subtle chemical factors that interfere in the photo-and thermally induced electron transfer are reviewed herein. A special attention is paid to the design of d-f cyanido-bridged squares, less numerous compared to the d-d/d ' ones, that proved to be suitable model compounds for the theoretical treatment of the magnetic exchange interaction between d and f spin carriers across the cyanide ligand. The square-shaped PBAs represent a very active area of research that is enriched yearly with new examples with potential for the development of molecular-scaled electronic devices.

TI Rationally designed trimetallic Prussian blue analogues on LDH/Ni foam
   for high performance supercapacitors
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Rational design of a Prussian blue analogue (PBA)@Ni-Co layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanocomposite electrode material is vitally important for synthesizing high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. In this work, such nanocomposite electrode materials were successfully fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method. Firstly, three-dimensional (3D) regulated NiCo-LDH nanosheets with high interlayer space were grown on nickel foam under mild synthetic conditions. Then these nanosheets as a precursor were in situ converted into the target PBA@NiCo-LDH/NF nanocomposite electrode by a facile thermal ion-exchange reaction with potassium ferricyanide (K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]). A series of PBA@NiCo-LDH/NF nanocomposite electrodes were fabricated with different ratios of Ni and Co and reaction temperatures. Their structures and morphologies were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical investigation reveals that the PBA@Ni0.4Co0.6-LDH electrode exhibits the best electrochemical performance with an area specific capacitance of 2004.26 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2), which is much higher (about three times) than the properties of each single component. All results demonstrate that (1) high-performance composite electrodes can be effectively fabricated and (2) fabrication of such composites is highly necessary and important.

TI Prussian blue analogues-Derived Iron-Cobalt carbon fiber Binder-Free
   electrodes for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Developing a highly selective and efficient electrocatalytic system for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is of great significance but still remains challenging for environmental remediation and energy utilization. Herein, we constructed a binder-free cathode consisted of iron-cobalt Prussian blue analogues-based bimetal derived carbon fiber (FC-PBAFC) to enhance NO3RR performances. Significantly, high NO3--N removal capacity of 169.1 mgN h(-1) g(cat)(-1), excellent ammonia Faradic efficiency (FE) of 83.2 +/- 0.7 % and high ammonia selectivity of 99.3 +/- 0.6 % were achieved by FC-PBAFC binder-free cathode. The excellent NO3RR performance was attributed to the rational polymer tethering strategy for the binder-free cathode construction. The introduction of polyacrylonitrile for electrospinning shaping essentially regulated the structural and compositional distribution of binder-free electrode during followed pyrolysis. The in-situ infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculation demonstrated that the Fe and Co regulation optimized the adsorption energy of key intermediate products with suppressing the side reactions. The bimetal binder-free cathode offers a promising strategy for selective and effective electroreduction of nitrate for ammonia synthesis.

TI Dual stabilization in potassium Prussian blue and cathode/electrolyte
   interface enables advanced-ion full-cells
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Potassium Prussian Blue (KPB) have been investigated as promising cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries. However, numerous structure defects and side reactions at electrode/electrolyte interface will deteriorate the electrochemical properties. Herein, dual stabilization strategy of structure of KPB particles and cathode/electrolyte interface is reported to enhance the capacity and electrochemical stability. The structure of KPB is stabilized through inhibiting nucleation and growth by addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium salt during co-precipitation, which can enlarge the particle size. Meanwhile, stabilizing the cathode/electrolyte interface via changing potassium hexafluorophosphate to potassium bis (fluorosulfonyl) imide (KFSI) electrolyte can further reduce side reactions to boost the coulombic efficiency of KPB cathode. Benefiting from dual engineering in structure of KPB and cathode/electrolyte interface, the half-cell in KFSI electrolyte possesses two discharge potential plateaus at 3.4 and 4.0 V with reversible capacity of 92.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.03 A g(-1). To demonstrate its practical use, KPB//graphite full cell device is successfully constructed, exhibiting the capacity up to 102.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), high rate (40.4 mAh g(-1) at 1.5 A g(-1)) and superior cyclic stability (88% capacity retention from cycle 25 to 400 at 1 A g(-1)). This work provides a synergetic engineering strategy to realize the powerful application of high-performance potassium-ion full-cell devices in energy storage.

TI Prussian blue analogue nanospheres immobilized on self-floating biochar
   for micropollutant degradation via photo-Fenton process
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Fe-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanospheres were immobilized on biochar (PBA-on-biochar) to remove contaminants via photo-Fenton process. The loading weight of FeCo PBA on biochar increased with increasing PBA aging temperature and time. The PBA exhibited efficient chloroquine phosphate (CQ) degradation under both LED light and sunlight, where center dot OH and O-1(2) dominated the oxidation. The CQ degradation was slightly affected by pH value (3.5-9.5) and co-existing anions like SO42-, Cl- and NO3-. The application potential of the PBA-on-biochar was evaluated in a continuous reaction device. Theoretical calculation revealed the dominant role of Fe sites in PBA for H2O2 activation. The degradation pathway was proposed based on nine intermediate products. Also, the excellent photo-Fenton activity and good floatability enable PBA-on-biochar to be efficient in inhibiting the activity of Microcystis aeruginosa under sunlight. The results implied that PBA-on-biochar is applicable for fast micropollutant oxidation from water.

TI Template confined strategy for constructing nickel cobalt selenide
   nanoarrays for efficient oxygen evolution reaction
SO MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY
AB Developing high-efficient and earth-abundant metals for the oxygen evolution reaction catalyst is of significant and promising but still challenging. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) show great potential for the dispersion and exposure of OER catalysts due to their adjustable element compositions and easily decomposable structures. Herein, bimetallic Ni-Co Prussian blue analogs grown on the conductive nickel foam supported by Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are designed and constructed. Firstly, the uniform dispersion of Ni-Co Prussian blue analogs has been realized on the surface of NF. By means of the confined decomposition of PBAs at calcination temperature, NiSe2/CoSe with the smaller particle size and good dispersion supported on NF can provide the more active sites when containing high electron transfer rate. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) measurements show that the as-prepared NiSe2/CoSe/NF exhibits the very impressive OER activity with low overpotential of 270 mV to reach the current density of 100 mA/cm(2). The special nanoarrays structure, abundant active sites and high intrinsic activity may contribute to the excellent performance. The synergistic effect of nickel-cobalt selenide and support enable superior stability toward OER. This confined decomposition strategy may provide a promising way to controlled assembly of transition metal-based electrocatalyst for OER. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption of
   Fe3O4@MnO2@Ni-Co/C composites derived
   from Prussian blue analogues
SO NANOSCALE
AB Herein, Fe3O4@MnO2@Ni-Co/C composites derived from PBAs were successfully fabricated. Firstly, Ni-Co Prussian blue analogues (Ni-Co PBAs) were used as precursors to derive a carbon layer on their surface by annealing treatment and subsequently translated into MnO2@Ni-Co/C nanocubes after hydrothermal reactions. Fe3O4@MnO2@Ni-Co/C composites were finally obtained after depositing Fe3O4 nanoparticles through the annealing process. Their electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption performance apparently enhanced, thanks to the excellent impedance matching and strong attenuation derived from the synergy between the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss. In particular, the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of Fe3O4@MnO2@Ni-Co/C reached -41.2 dB with a thickness of 4.0 mm and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) reached 7.1 GHz with a thickness of 2.0 mm. Therefore, the results could be significant for synthesizing EMW absorbers with excellent performance, a broad bandwidth, strong absorption, thin thickness and light weight.

TI Pd Ion-Exchange and Ammonia Etching of a Prussian Blue Analogue to
   Produce a High-Performance Water-Splitting Catalyst
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The authors report an ammonia-assisted in situ cation-exchange method for the synthesis of dodecagon N-doped PdCoNi carbon-based nanosheets (Pd-e-NiCo-PBA-C) and explore the catalytic performance. Pd-e-NiCo-PBA-C exerts extremely low overpotential and Tafel slope for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) both in acidic and alkaline media, only 47 mV, 55 mV dec(-1) (pH = 0, HER) and 147 mV, 67 mV dec(-1) (pH = 14, HER), and 309 mV, 67 mV dec(-1) (pH = 14, OER), outperforming commercial IrO2-based and Pt-based catalysts. In addition, after 5000 cycles, the linear sweep voltammetry curve shows a negligible shift, indicating excellent stability performance. To test its overall water-splitting performance, Pd-e-NiCo-PBA-C is applied as both cathode and anode materials. A high current density of 33 mA cm(-2) at a battery voltage of 1.6 V is obtained, with the catalytic activity maintained at 97.3% after over 50 h. To get a further insight into the superior OER and HER performance, theoretical calculations are carried out, the better performance originates from the affinity difference of Pd and Ni atoms for gas atoms, and the replacement of inert atoms can decrease the binding energy and enhance the electrocatalytic activity.

TI Surface Fluorination Engineering of NiFe Prussian Blue Analogue
   Derivatives for Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Surface engineering is of importance to reduce the reaction barrier of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, the NiFe Prussian blue analogue (NiFe-PBA)-F catalyst with a multilevel structure was obtained from NiFe-PBAs via a fluorination strategy, which presents an ultralow OER overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, with a small Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability. Interestingly, surface fluorination engineering could achieve a controllable removal of ligands of the cyan group, contributing to keep the framework structure of NiFe-PBAs. Particularly, NiFe-PBAs-F undergoes a dramatic reconstruction with the dynamic migration of F ions, which creates more active sites of F-doped NiFeOOH and affords more favorable adsorption of oxygen intermediates. Density functional theory calculations suggest that F doping increases the state density of Ni 3d orbital around the Fermi level, thus improving the conductivity of NiFeOOH. Furthermore, based on our experimental results, the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism for NiFe-PBAs-F was proposed. Our work not only provides a new pathway to realize the controllable pyrolysis of NiFe-PBAs but also gives more insights into the reconstruction and the mechanism for the OER process.

TI Exploring affinity between organic probes and Prussian Blue Analogues
   via inverse gas chromatography
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs), which are characterized by their open structure, high stability, and non-toxic properties, have recently been the subject of research for various applications, including their use as electrode precursors for capacitive deionization, gas storage, and environmental purification. These materials can be readily tailored to enhance their affinity towards gases for integration with sensing devices. An improved understanding of PBA-gas interactions is expected to enhance material development and existing sensor deposition schemes greatly. The use of inverse gas chromatography (IGC) is a robust approach for examining the relationship between porous materials and gases. In this study, the adsorption properties of (functionalized) hydrocarbons, i.e., probe molecules, on the copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) lattice were studied via IGC, demonstrating that alkylbenzenes have a higher affinity for this material than n-alkanes. This difference was rationalized by steric hindrance, pi-pi interactions, and vapour pressure effects. Along the same line, the five isomers of hexane showed decreasing selectivity upon increased steric hindrance. Enthalpy values for n-pentane, n-hexane and n-heptane were lower than that of toluene. The introduction of increased probe masses resulted in a surface coverage of 46% for toluene. For all n-alkane probe molecules this percentage was lower. However, the isotherms of these probes did not show saturation points and the observed linear regime proves beneficial for gas sensing. Our work demonstrates the versatility of CuHCF for gas sensing purposes and the potential of IGC to characterize the adsorption characteristics of such a porous nanomaterial.

TI Efficient electrochemical reduction of nitrate by bimetallic Cu-Fe
   phosphide derived from Prussian blue analogue
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Designing electrocatalysts for nitrate (NO3-) reduction with excellent activity, low cost and stability is of great interest. Herein we synthesized a novel transition bimetallic phosphide (CuFeP-x, x referred to the phosphidation temperature) catalyst by phosphidation using CuFe-Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanoparticles as the precursor. The obtained CuFeP-450 maintained the morphology of nanocube with the average size of 33.0 nm and bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles formed during the phosphidation process. The higher electrocatalytic activity of CuFeP-x in electrochemical NO3- reduction were attained as compared to that of calcined CuFe-450, because the CuFeP-x have a lower interface impedance and the dominated species for NO3- reduction changes from electron to atomic H*, which effectively enhanced the removal rate. The appropriate phosphidation temperature can form a crystal structure that facilitated reaction kinetics. As a result, CuFeP-450 showed the best electrocatalytic performance for NO3- reduction (99.42%), and the selectivity of N-2 can reach nearly 100% under the condition of 1000 mg L-1 chloride ions. This simple method using PBA with binary transition metals to prepare bimetallic phosphide provides a new direction for designing efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts for NO3- reduction.

TI General formation of Prussian blue analogue microtubes for
   high-performance Na-ion hybrid supercapacitors
SO SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS
AB One-dimensional (1D) hollow-structured nanomaterials with desirable compositions have aroused huge attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In the present study, 1D hierarchical cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) microtubes were initially fabricated using a facile self-templated method with the electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-cobalt acetate (Co(Ac)(2)) as templates. After the chemical reaction was performed between the templates and a potassium ferricyanide solution, the core-shell PAN-Co(Ac)(2)@CoHCF nanofibers were successfully fabricated. Subsequently, the CoHCF microtubes were finally obtained via the selective dissolution of the PAN-Co(Ac)(2) cores. Benefiting from the unique structural characteristic, the CoHCF microtubes electrode exhibited prominent electrochemical characteristics in Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, including a high specific capacitance of 281.8 F g(-1) (at 1 A g(-1)), and good rate capability as well as long cycling stability (93% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). The hybrid supercapacitor assembled with CoHCF microtubes and activated carbon (AC) as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, exhibited a high energy density of 43.89 W h kg(-1), a power density of 27.78 kW kg(-1), as well as a long cycle life. Note that this versatile self templated synthetic strategy could be extended to fabricate other 1D hollow Prussian blue (PB) or its analogues (PBA) with controllable composition, which have a potential application in a range of fields.

TI Bimetallic FeMn@C derived from Prussian blue analogue as efficient
   nanozyme for glucose detection
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In recent decades, nanomaterial-based artificial enzymes called nanozymes have received more and more attention and have been applied in biological, chemical, medical, and other fields. In this work, bimetallic FeMn@C was synthesized by calcination from the Prussian blue analogue. The synthesized bimetallic FeMn@C exhibits efficient peroxidase-like activity. The effect of Mn doping amount, catalytic kinetics, and mechanism of FeMn@C nanozyme was further studied in detail. The results show that the peroxidase-like activity of bimetallic FeMn@C is nearly 16 times higher than that of single-metal Fe@C. The peroxidase-like activity of FeMn@C originates from its production of radicals. Compared with natural enzymes, FeMn@C nanozyme has a better affinity for the substrates. Besides, FeMn@C nanozyme has better stability than natural enzymes. Because of its strong magnetism, FeMn@C nanozyme can be recycled easily and exhibits excellent recycling performance. Based on the good affinity of FeMn@C for H2O2, a rapid and selective colorimetric assay for glucose detection is constructed, with a wide linear range of 0.01-0.75 mM and low detection limit of 4.28 mu M. This sensor has been successfully applied to the determination of glucose in fruit juice, showing good selectivity and accuracy. The synthesis of bimetallic FeMn@C provides a feasible way to design nanozymes with excellent catalytic activity, high stability, and easy separation.

TI Toward Quantitative Magnetic Information from Transition Metal K-Edge
   XMCD of Prussian Blue Analogs
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Two series of Prussian blue analogs (PBA) were used as model compounds in order to disentangle the information contained in X-ray magneticcircular dichroism (XMCD) at the K-edges of transition metals. The number of 3delectrons on one site of the bimetallic cyanide polymer has been varied byassociating to the [Fe(CN)6]3-or the [Cr(CN)6]3-precursors various divalentmetal ions A2+(Mn2+,Fe2+,Co2+,Ni2+, and Cu2+). The compounds were studied byX-ray diffraction and SQUID magnetometry, as well as by X-ray absorptionspectroscopy and XMCD at the K-edges of the A2+transition metal ion. The studyshows that the 1s -> 4p contribution to the A K-edge XMCD signal can be relatedto the electronic structure and the magnetic behavior of the probed A2+ion: theshape of the signal to thefilling of the 3d orbitals, the sign of the signal to thedirection of the magnetic moment with respect to the applied magneticfield, theintensity of the signal to the total spin numberSA, and the area under curve to theCurie constantCA. The whole study hence demonstrates that PBAs are particularly well-adapted for understanding the informationcontained in the transition metals K-edge XMCD signals. It also offers new perspectives toward the full disentangling of the information contained in these signals and access to new insights into materials magnetic properties.

TI Capacitive-Controlled Prussian White with a Nickel Iron Hexacyanoferrate
   Composite Cathode for Rapid Sodium Diffusion
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues receive tremendous attention owing to their spacious three-dimensional skeleton, high theoretical specific capacity, facile synthesis procedure, and high cost-effectiveness as among the most promising candidates for cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nonetheless, the practical specific capacity, especially under high current, is particularly frail due to the sluggish ion diffusion. In this study, the strategy of Ni substitution and formation of water-coordinated Fe is applied to lower the crystal field energy and elevate the active low-spin (LS) Fe content, which leads to a capacitive sodium storage mechanism, resulting in a substantial specific capacity under high current density. The delivered specific capacity of PW-325@2NiFe-55 is 95 mAh g(-1) at 50 C, which is 72.5% capacity retention of the one at 0.5 C. Also, it maintains 80.2% of its initial specific capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, a hypothesis of a joint diffusion-controlled and capacitive mechanism for high-spin (HS) Fe and a mere capacitive mechanism for LS Fe is put forward and verified through potentiastatic tests, operando Fe-57 M & ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy, and ex situ XRD, which provides a new horizon to enhance the electrochemical performance for SIBs.

TI High-pressure behavior of heteroepitaxial core-shell particles made of
   Prussian blue analogs
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We report the compressibility of two Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) under hydrostatic pressure, one with small and one with a relatively large cubic unit cell among PBAs, and investigate the modification of their elastic properties when the two lattices are coupled within a heteroepitaxial core-shell structure. Bulk modulus (K-0) values are derived from x-ray powder diffraction experiments using a diamond anvil cell with silicone oil as a pressure-transmitting medium. The pressure-volume curves fitted to Murnaghan equations of states show that K-0 inversely scales with the crystal packing for the rubidium cobalt hexacyanoferrate and rubidium nickel hexacyanochromate samples (K-0 similar to 29 GPa for Co-Fe PBA, a(0) = 9.95 angstrom and similar to 20 GPa for Ni-Cr PBA, a(0) = 10.48 angstrom with a(0) being the lattice constant at ambient pressure). The two single-phase samples undergo a cubic-to-rhombohedral phase transition above similar to 0.8 GPa, which correlates fairly well with the build-up of nonhydrostatic pressure contributions in the cell. Within the core-shell structure, the volume change observed for the core scales with that of the shell because of the configuration close to the case of a solid pressure-transmitting medium. The Ni-Cr PBA shell layer exhibits an increased rhombohedral distortion with respect to the single-phase reference possibly associated with shearing at the core-shell interface. Its bulk modulus is not significantly modified with respect to that of the single-phase sample despite the presence of defects associated with the growth mode, whereas the P-V curve of the core suggests a stiffening of the Co-Fe PBA lattice.

TI Prussian blue analog with separated active sites to catalyze water
   driven enhanced catalytic treatments
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) uses Fenton chemistry to covert hydrogen peroxide in cancer cells to toxic hydroxyl radicals, but endogenous hydrogen peroxide is insufficient to drive sustainable CDT. Here, the authors report a water oxidation CoFe Prussian blue nanoframe to provide sustained, external energy free self-supply of hydroxyl radicals for CDT.
   Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) uses the Fenton or Fenton-like reaction to yield toxic ‧OH following H2O2 & RARR; ‧OH for tumoral therapy. Unfortunately, H2O2 is often taken from the limited endogenous supply of H2O2 in cancer cells. A water oxidation CoFe Prussian blue (CFPB) nanoframes is presented to provide sustained, external energy-free self-supply of ‧OH from H2O to process CDT and/or photothermal therapy (PTT). Unexpectedly, the as-prepared CFPB nanocubes with no near-infrared (NIR) absorption is transformed into CFPB nanoframes with NIR absorption due to the increased Fe3+-N & EQUIV; C-Fe2+ composition through the proposed proton-induced metal replacement reactions. Surprisingly, both the CFPB nanocubes and nanoframes provide for the self-supply of O-2, H2O2, and ‧OH from H2O, with the nanoframe outperforming in the production of ‧OH. Simulation analysis indicates separated active sites in catalyzation of water oxidation, oxygen reduction, and Fenton-like reactions from CFPB. The liposome-covered CFPB nanoframes prepared for controllable water-driven CDT for male tumoral mice treatments.

TI Novel Prussian-blue-analogue microcuboid assemblies and their derived
   catalytic performance for effective reduction of 4-nitrophenol
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) have been widely investigated in fields such as lithium-ion batteries (LIB), supercapacitors, catalysts and water splitting due to their excellent physical and chemical properties. To boost their application, various novel architectures based on PBA cubes have been fabricated. In this work, a one-dimensional (1D) Co-Fe PBA cuboid with a length of 1-2 mm was solvo-thermally synthesized for the first time using a Co-Fe PBA cube as the building block through a self-assembly process. Time-dependent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation revealed that the PBA cubes underwent a structural decomposition into smaller cubes and then assembled to cuboids along a certain preferential orientation. Fascinatingly, this method can be expanded to other PBA cubes. After annealing, the obtained Co-Fe PBA cuboid-derived product, CoFe/NC-MCBs, can be used as a hydrogenation catalyst for highly effective reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). This method provides great opportunities to fabricate novel cuboid structures with tunable chemical composition, which would promote the further application of PBA in different aspects.

TI A low-defect and Na-enriched Prussian blue lattice with ultralong cycle
   life for sodium-ion battery cathode
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Prussian blue compounds have been considered as attractive candidate cathodes for sodium ion battery (SIB) due to open channel structure, tunable chemical compositions and potential high capacity. However, their low capacity utilization and insufficient cyclability have hindered their large-scale applications. In this work, a series of Na-enrich PB lattices (NaxFe[Fe(CN)6](1-y) center dot zH(2)O) with different contents of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and coordinated water are synthesized to investigate the effects of the lattice defects on the reversible capacities and cycling stabilities of the PB materials. It is found that decreasing the content of structural defects can greatly elevate the electrochemical performance of the PB cathodes. The as prepared low-defect and Nathorn-enriched Na1.81Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.83) center dot 2.04H(2)O lattice can achieve a high reversible capacity of >140 mAh g(-1), a superior rate capability with 55.2% of its initial capacity at 10 C and a long-term cyclability with 78% capacity retention over 3700 cycles, possibly serving as a low cost, high capacity and cycle-stable cathode for Na ion batteries.

TI Energy Harvesting by Nickel Prussian Blue Analogue Electrode in
   Neutralization and Mixing Entropy Batteries
SO LANGMUIR
AB Some industries usually reduce the concentration of protons in acidic wastewater by conducting neutralization reactions and/or adding seawater to industrial effluents. This work proposes a novel electrochemical system that can harvest energy originating from entropic changes due to alteration in the concentration of sodium ions along wastewater treatment. Preparation of a self-assembled material from nickel Prussian blue analogue (NPBA) was the first step to obtain such electrochemical system. Investigation into the electrochemical properties of this material helped to evaluate its potential use in neutralization and mixing entropy batteries. Assessment of parameters such as the potentiodynamic profile of the current density as a function of the concentration of protons and sodium ions, charge capacity, and cyclability as well as the reversibility of the sodium ion electroinsertion process aided estimation of the energy storage efficiency of the system. Frequency-domain measurements and models and the proposed charge compensation mechanism provided the rate constants at different dc potentials. After each charge/discharge cycle, the NPBA electrode harvested 12.4 kJ per mol of intercalated sodium ion in aqueous solutions of NaCl at concentrations of 20 mM and 3.0 M. The full electrochemical cell consisted of an NPBA positive electrode and a negative electrode of silver particles dispersed in a polypyrrole electrode. This cell extracted 16.8 kJ per mol of intercalated ion after each charge/discharge cycle. On the basis of these results, the developed electrochemical system should encourage wastewater treatment and help to achieve sustainable growth.

TI Probing the Electronic Structure of Prussian Blue and Analog Films by

SO CHEMPHYSCHEM
AB X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS) were employed to characterize the electronic properties of Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs when electrodeposited over metal-decorated carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Through an investigation of the influence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and preparation conditions on the electronic structure, valuable insights were obtained regarding their effects on electrochemical properties. XPS analysis enabled the probing of the chemical composition and oxidation states of the film materials, unveiling synthesis-driven variations in their electronic properties. REELS provided information on energy loss and electronic transitions, enabling further characterization of the changes in the electronic structure induced by different preparation methods. Such findings emphasize the importance of surface characterization to understand how the unique electronic properties of such materials can be harnessed to enhance their performance and functionality.

TI Sodium to cesium ions: a general ladder mechanism of ion diffusion in
   prussian blue analogs
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) form crystals with large lattice voids that are suitable for the capture, transport and storage of various interstitial ions. Recently, we introduced the concept of a ladder mechanism to describe how sodium ions inside a PBA crystal structure diffuse by climbing the frames formed by aligned cyanide groups in the host structure. The current work uses semi-empirical tight-binding density functional theory (DFTB) in a multiscale approach to investigate how differences in the size of the monovalent cation affect the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the diffusion process. The results show that the ladder mechanism represents a unified framework, from which both similarities and differences between cation types can be understood. Fundamental Coulombic interactions make all positive cations avoid the open vacant areas in the structure, while cavities surrounded by partially negatively charged cyanide groups form diffusion bottlenecks and traps for larger cations. These results provide a new and quantitative way of understanding the suppression of cesium adsorption that has previously been reported for PBAs characterized by a low vacancy density. In conclusion, this work provides a unified picture of the cation adsorption in PBAs based on the newly formulated ladder mechanism.

TI Probing the Influence of Defects, Hydration, and Composition on Prussian
   Blue Analogues with Pressure
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The vast compositional space of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), formula A(x)M[M'(CN)(6)](y)center dot nH(2)O, allows for a diverse range of functionality. Yet, the interplay between composition and physical properties-e.g., flexibility and propensity for phase transitions-is still largely unknown, despite its fundamental and industrial relevance. Here we use variable-pressure X-ray and neutron diffraction to explore how key structural features, i.e., defects, hydration, and composition, influence the compressibility and phase behavior of PBAs. Defects enhance the flexibility, manifesting as a remarkably low bulk modulus (B-0 approximate to 6 GPa) for defective PBAs. Interstitial water increases B-0 and enables a pressure-induced phase transition in defective systems. Conversely, hydration does not alter the compressibility of stoichiometric MnPt(CN)(6), but changes the high-pressure phase transitions, suggesting an interplay between low-energy distortions. AMnCo(CN)(6) (A(I) = Rb, Cs) transition from F (4) over bar 3m to P (4) over bar n2 upon compression due to octahedral tilting, and the critical pressure can be tuned by the A-site cation. At 1 GPa, the symmetry of Rb0.87Mn[Co(CN)(6)](0.91) is further lowered to the polar space group Pn by an improper ferroelectric mechanism. These fundamental insights aim to facilitate the rational design of PBAs for applications within a wide range of fields.

TI Progress and challenges of Prussian blue analogs for potassium-ion

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are becoming one of the substitutes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their abundant raw materials and low cost. However, the lack of cathode materials with high capacity, high working voltage and excellent cycle performance limits the development of PIBs. In this case, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are increasingly becoming a research focus as promising cathode materials owing to their good cycle stability and rapid potassium ion diffusion rate in their 3D framework. Herein, from the perspective of redox-active transition metals (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, etc.), we present the development and electrochemical properties of all the reported PBAs and summarize their advantages and disadvantages in terms of capacity, cycle life, voltage plateau, cost, etc. Finally, aiming at PBAs with different redox-active transition metals, some versatile strategies and specific methods are proposed for the future development of PBAs and the commercial application of PIBs.

TI Prussian Blue Nanolayer-Embedded Separator for Selective Segregation of
   Nickel Dissolution in High Nickel Cathodes
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Transition metal layered oxides (LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2, NCM) have been considered as one of the most promising cathodes for lithium-ion batteries used in long-mileage electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Despite its potential interest, dissolved transition metal (TM) ions toward anode sides can catalyze parasitic reactions such as electrolytic decomposition and dendritic Li growth, ultimately leading to catastrophic safety hazards. In this study, we demonstrate that Prussian Blue (PB) nanoparticles anchored to a commercial PE separator significantly reduce cell resistance and effectively suppress TM crossover during cycling, even under harsh conditions that accelerate Ni dissolution. Therefore, using a PB-coated separator in a harsh condition to intentionally dissolve Ni2+ ions at a high cutoff potential of 4.6 V, NCMllgraphite full cells maintain 50.8% of their initial capacity at the 150th cycle. Scalable production of PB-coated separator through the facile synthetic methods can help establish a new research direction for the design of high-energy-density batteries.

SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The uniaxial zero thermal expansion (ZTE) in distorted Prussian blue analogue (PBA) RbCuCo(CN)(6) is reproduced by employing first-principles calculations, which agrees well with the experimental data. Also, the zero linear compressibility (ZLC) behavior in RbCuCo(CN)(6) can be found. The special Jahn-Teller distortion introduced by Cu2+ in RbCuCo(CN)(6) is noticed by investigating the change of the local structure with temperature and hydrostatic pressure. The lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) and phonon group velocity of RbCuCo(CN)(6) are studied, where the LTC and phonon group velocity are significantly anisotropic. Especially, RbCuCo(CN)(6) exhibits a quite low LTC, and its c-axis shows a characteristic of glasslike LTC at low temperatures. Our work facilitates a deep understanding of the coexistence mechanisms of uniaxial ZTE and ZLC properties in RbCuCo(CN)(6).

TI Preparation of thin films of molecule-based magnets for optical
   measurements
SO THIN SOLID FILMS
AB Prussian blue analogues provide a useful model system for studying how the magnetic properties of molecularbased systems can be both perturbed and probed using light. However, the study of thin films of these materials using transmission-based optical techniques is limited due to their polycrystalline (or sometimes amorphous) morphology and inconsistent homogeneity, which act to scatter light. To address this shortcoming, thin films of Cr-Cr and Fe-Cr Prussian blue analogues have been encapsulated by suitable transparent adhesives to mitigate the effects of scatter, which would be of particular benefit in experiments that rely on the polarization of transmitted light being maintained. It is observed that transmittance is appreciably improved across the visible spectrum following encapsulation, reaching a tenfold increase at certain wavelengths. This is due to a combination of the reduction of air/film interfaces and refractive index-matching between adhesive and film.

TI In situ XRF analysis of Cs adsorption by the precipitation bands
   of Prussian blue analogues formed in agarose gels
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY
AB The measurement of Cs adsorption by the precipitation bands of Mn-based Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), Co-based PBAs, and Prussian blue (PB), which were spontaneously formed in agarose gel, was carried out using in situ X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. Three gel samples, namely "Mn-PBA," "Co-PBA," and "PB," were prepared by bringing 0.05 M [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) agarose gel (2.3 mass%) into contact with 0.50 M solutions of MnSO4, CoCl2, and FeCl2, respectively. Mn-PBA formed relatively wide, discrete precipitation bands, whereas Co-PBA and PB each formed a continuous band. The XRF intensity distribution measurements determined using an energy-dispersive XRF setup showed that the PBA/PB concentration fluctuates considerably in Mn-PBA but not in Co-PBA or PB. Time-dependent Cs L-emission distributions for these samples, into which a 0.10 M CsCl solution was introduced, indicated that in agarose gel, the precipitates of Mn-based PBAs can trap Cs+ more effectively than those of PB and Co-based PBAs if the Cs processing time is relatively long (i.e., >= 10 d). These results demonstrate the potential applicability of Mn-based PBA precipitates that are self-organized in agarose gel as pulsatile Cs-137 adsorbent delivery materials.

TI High-crystallinity and high-rate Prussian Blue analogues synthesized at
   the oil-water interface
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) are considered to be cathode materials for practical applications in sodium-ion batteries due to their open three-dimensional structure and low cost. However, PBAs synthesized by traditional methods generally have poor crystallinity and a high content of [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancy defects and coordinate water, which not only affect the Na+-storage capacity of PBAs, but also hinder Na+ transportation in the bulk phase and lead to a deterioration in electrochemical performance. Therefore, we propose an unconventional two-phase method to synthesize PBAs. Due to the unique reaction environment of the two-phase method, the reaction time lasts long, which is advantageous to control the synthesis of PBAs to ensure high crystallinity, low defects, and a suitable size. The as-prepared PBA at optimal condition delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 152 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C (1 C = 170 mA h g(-1)), 110 and 105 mA h g(-1) even at high current densities of 10 C and 20 C,respectively, as well as a capacity retention of 84% after 200 cycles at 2 C. In particular, superior electrochemical performances also suggested that the two-phase method could be extended to the synthesis of other types of PBAs, such as Mn-PBAs and Co-PBAs, or even more materials with poor crystallinity due to rapid nucleation and growth.

TI Four-Electron Redox Reaction in Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode Material
   for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are considered promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, traditional PBAs have limitations, such as up to two-electron-transfer reactions, lattice vacancies, coordinated water, and poor intrinsic conductivity, leading to low capacity and poor rate performance. Herein, we have developed vacancy/water-free silver hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles interlinked with carbon nanotubes (AgHCF@CNTs) to improve the electrochemical performance. Benefiting from the four-electron redox capacity of Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ag+/Ag, the AgHCF@CNTs exhibit a reversible capacity of 168.4 mAh g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1), high rate capability (90.7 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)), and long cycling stability over 500 cycles. The in-situ-generated Ag during the discharging/charging process, along with the large interstitial spaces of ferricyano-coordination groups, facilitate electron transfer and Na+ transportation, guaranteeing high electrochemical performance. This study provides insights into the design and synthesis strategy for advancing multiple-electron redox hexacyanoferrate as cathode materials for high-performance SIBs.

TI Selective edge etching to improve the rate capability of Prussian blue
   analogues for sodium ion batteries
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBA) possess a high theoretical specific capacity for sodium ion batteries. However, cycling PBA to a high current density causes severe capacity fading. Here, we develop a selective edge-etching approach to tackle this long-standing issue of poor rate capability. Well-crystallized PBA particles were produced by hydrothermal treatment of a sodium hexacyanoferrate precursor dissolved in muriatic acid solution, which were then eroded in hydrochloric acid solution to promote selective etching along the edges of the PBA crystals. The defect concentration ([Fe(CN)(6)](4-)) on the edge is denser than that at the face or corner, which stimulates the preferred etching of edges via the defect-induced heterogeneous mechanism. Due to the increasing exposed surface area and active sites, the etched PBA display much improved electrochemical performance with a capacity of 167 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 5 mA g(-1) and a capacity retention of 82.7% when the current density was increased to 40 mA g(-1), demonstrating fast sodium ion transfer and high rate capability.

TI Linking the polyatomic arrangements of interstitial H2O and
   cations to bonding within Prussian blue analogues ab initio using
   gradient-boosted machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are model host compounds for the intercalation of monovalent cations for electrochemical energy storage and separations. However, the interactions among interstitial species and their effects on atomic arrangements therein are understood mainly at a phenomenological level. Analyzing correlations between electronic interactions and polyatomic arrangements in hydrated Prussian blue analogues is complicated by the nonlocal hydrogen-bonding interactions between zeolitic water and framework lattices. Here, we train machine-learning (ML) models to learn DFT-calculated energy landscapes of nickel hexacyanoferrate PBA lattices with various lattice hydration degrees, oxidation states, and types of intercalated alkali cations based on various three-particle feature parameters. This ML approach is enabled by using gradient-boosted regression trees with features that are rotationally invariant geometric parameters. ML model accuracy is shown to be a cation-specific indicator of correlations between energy and polyatomic arrangements. Overlap population analysis among correlated atoms further confirms that such correlations are caused by the competition for dative bonding between Lewis-acid intercalated cations and Lewis bases (cyanide and oxygen in H2O). Examination of lowest-energy structures reveals that cation hydrophilicity and bare ionic radius determine dative-bonding strength, resulting in cation-H2O ordering in interstitial space. The projected energy landscapes of hydrated PBA lattices is also explored in subspaces spanned by certain many-particle feature parameters inspired by ML analysis. The downhill traces in such landscapes indicate that lattice distortion is accompanied by two kinds of collective movements: (1) rearrangements in the hydration shells around small and hydrophilic cations and (2) collective attack of H2O molecules on nickel-cyanide bonds promoted by large, hydrophobic cations.

TI Beyond Nonactin: Potentiometric Ammonium Ion Sensing Based on
   Ion-selective Membrane-free Prussian Blue Analogue Transducers
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The determination of ammonium ions (NH4+) is of significance to environmental, agriculture, and human health. Potentiometric NH4+ sensors based on solid-contact ion selective electrodes (SC-ISEs) feature point-of-care testing and miniatur-ization. However, the state-of-the-art SC-ISEs of NH4+ during the past 20 years strongly rely on the organic ammonium ionophore-based ion selective membrane (ISM), typically by nonactin for the NH4+ recognition. Herein, we report a Prussian blue analogue of copper(II)-hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) for an ISM-free potentio-metric NH4+ sensor without using the ionophores. CuHCF works as a bifunctional transducer that could realize the ion-to-electron transduction and NH4+ recognition. CuHCF exhibits competitive analytical performances regarding traditional nonactin-based SC-ISEs of NH4+, particularly for the selectivity toward K+. The cost and preparation process have been remarkably reduced. The theoretical calculation combined with electrochemical tests further demonstrate that relatively easier intercalation of NH4+ into the lattices of CuHCF determines its selectivity. This work provides a concept of the ISM-free potentiometric NH4+ sensor beyond the nonactin ionophore through a CuHCF bifunctional transducer.

TI Unveiling the role of structural vacancies in Mn-based Prussian blue
   analogues for energy storage applications
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising cathode materials for monovalent- and multivalent-ion batteries due to their large framework structures. Nevertheless, the influence of lattice vacancies on their electrochemical performance has not been thoroughly clarified, hindering the further development of PBAs. Here we identify two types of functional vacancies, i.e., structural vacancies (SVs) and incidental vacancies (IVs), in manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) through synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Unlike structurally disordered IVs, the introduction of structurally ordered SVs promotes ion transport and reduces the interaction between host ions and the framework, enabling improved cycling and rate performance. The controllable adjustment of SVs in K-rich MnHCF is achieved through a co-reactant method. Furthermore, the partial introduction of SVs in K-rich MnHCF is demonstrated to favor both a milder structural evolution by alleviating the Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+ and a stable dynamic process of interface reaction. This study unveils the potential importance of incorporating structural vacancies into MnHCF for advanced energy storage applications.

TI Prussian blue analogue assisted formation of iron doped CoNiSe2
   nanosheet arrays for efficient oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach to produce hydrogen gas, but sluggish fourelectron transfer of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely limits the overall energy conversion efficiency of water splitting. Herein, as an excellent OER electrocatalyst, a technique of synthesizing Fe doped CoNiSe2 nanosheet (Fe-CoNiSe2) whole series using CoFe prussian blue analog produced by CoZIF-L reaction as a template is proposed here. The introduction of iron ions promotes the redistribution of the cobalt-nickel charge density, which enhances the OER kinetics. In view of the abovementioned points, Fe-CoNiSe2/NF has excellent activity, electrocatalytic properties and excellent stability in alkaline media, which only demands a lower overpotential of 244 mV and 271 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and 50 mA cm2, respectively. The material also exhibits excellent stability for at least 24 h during the OER process. This work may provide some new insights into the assembly of advanced and highly-active materials for a variety of other energy conversion applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Boosting the activity of Prussian-blue analogue as efficient
   electrocatalyst for water and urea oxidation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The design and fabrication of intricate hollow architectures as cost-effective and dual-function electrocatalyst for water and urea electrolysis is of vital importance to the energy and environment issues. Herein, a facile solvothermal strategy for construction of Prussian-blue analogue (PBA) hollow cages with an open framework was developed. The as-obtained CoFe and NiFe hollow cages (CFHC and NFHC) can be directly utilized as electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with superior catalytic performance (lower electrolysis potential, faster reaction kinetics and long-term durability) compared to their parent solid precursors (CFC and NFC) and even the commercial noble metal-based catalyst. Impressively, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, the CFHC catalyst required an overpotential of merely 330 mV, 21.99% lower than that of the solid CFC precursor (423 mV) at the same condition. Meanwhile, the NFHC catalyst could deliver a current density as high as 100 mA cm(-2) for the urea oxidation electrolysis at a potential of only 1.40 V, 24.32% lower than that of the solid NFC precursor (1.85 V). This work provides a new platform to construct intricate hollow structures as promising nano-materials for the application in energy conversion and storage.

SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB The quest for an efficient and inexpensive electrocatalyst via a convenient procedure is pivotal for the development of reliable energy conversion and storage devices. Herein, for the first time, we designed a strategy and tailored a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) derived cobalt telluride (Co0.63Te) electrocatalyst meant for both the oxygen evolution reaction and supercapacitor. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and needed only 317 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Similarly, Co0.63Te exhibits a specific capacitance of 680 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) in 5 M KOH electrolyte with remarkable capacitive retention and a noteworthy 97% coulombic efficiency after 5000 CV cycles. This work provides a distinct route to design an efficient noble-metal-free catalyst through a conventional hydrothermal method for both energy conversion and storage.

TI In-situ polymerization of polypyrrole on Prussian blue analogue for high

SO SYNTHETIC METALS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been considered as promising cathode materials for zinc-ion batteries. However, severe capacity decay issues hamper their deployment. Herein, Mn-ion-substituted zinc hexacyanoferrate (MZHCF) cathode materials were coated with polypyrrole (PPy) by in situ polymerization. The prepared MZHCF@PPy composites have exhibited significant ionic absorption affinity and great structural stability. Benefiting from the PPy coating, the ZIBs based on MZHCF@PPy cathodes and a conductive poly(acrylamide) (PAAM) hydrogel electrode exhibit enhanced capacities, which reach a maximum value of 190.1 mAh g- 1 at 0.5 A g-1, three times higher than that of the device based on MZHCF electrodes. The flexible ZIBs not only present outstanding cyclic performance but also retain stable energy storage capability under various deformations. The presented method is a promising technology for the practical application of rechargeable ZIBs with high safety and flexibility.

TI Exploring Zinc-Doped Manganese Hexacyanoferrate as Cathode for Aqueous
   Zinc-Ion Batteries
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZiBs) have emerged as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries as energy storage systems from renewable sources. Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) is a Prussian Blue analogue that exhibits the ability to insert divalent ions such as Zn2+. However, in an aqueous environment, MnHCF presents weak structural stability and suffers from manganese dissolution. In this work, zinc doping is explored as a strategy to provide the structure with higher stability. Thus, through a simple and easy-to-implement approach, it has been possible to improve the stability and capacity retention of the cathode, although at the expense of reducing the specific capacity of the system. By correctly balancing the amount of zinc introduced into the MnHCF it is possible to reach a compromise in which the loss of capacity is not critical, while better cycling stability is obtained.

TI Fabrication of Co1.5Ni1.5S4 and Prussian blue analogues composites with
   yolk-shell heterostructures as cathode and biomass derived carbon as
   anode for asymmetric supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB As highly efficient electrode materials for supercapacitors, the clean production of transition metal sulfide and biomass -derived carbon played an important role in promoting the practical process. In this work, Prussian blue analogues were grown in situ on glycerate precursors through a simple ion -exchange process, followed by sulfidation to obtain the Co1.5Ni1.5S4 and Prussian blue analogues composite microspheres with yolk -shell structures. Thanks to the unique micro -nano structure and multi -element synergy, composites exhibited excellent specific capacitance (up to 2388.7 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), rate performance (55.0 % capacitance retention at 30 A g-1), and cycling stability (capacitance maintained at 81.5 % after 5000 cycles). In addition, Nitrogen -doped sunflower seed shell derived carbon, prepared by two pyrolysis and salt -activation processes, could attain a specific capacitance of 347.1 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and an almost undiminished capacity of 5000 cycles. With Co1.5Ni1.5S4 and Prussian blue analogues composites as cathode and derived carbon as anode, the assembled hybrid supercapacitor exhibited an eminent energy density of 82.2 Wh kg- 1 (at a power density of 904.9 W kg - 1) and stable cycling characteristics (only 16.7 % loss of capacitance after 10,000 cycles). This work provided a feasible scheme for the structure regulation of sulfides and the defect construction of porous carbon.

TI An Ab Initio Study of Clusters as Building Blocks for Crystals: From
   Prussian Blue Analogs to Hybrid Perovskites
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Cluster-based crystals containing the (Nb6Cl12)(2+) or (Ta6Cl12)(2+) clusters, including the well-known Nb6Cl14, K4Nb6Cl18, and the Prussian blue analog (Me4N)(2) [MnNb6Cl12(CN)(6)], have been investigated by density functional theory. The electronic structure of the cluster is the same for all compounds, with a semiconducting gap of around 1 eV between occupied and empty states, in the range of interest for solar energy applications. Calculations suggest that these clusters could be used as cations in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, as a substitute for toxic Pb2+. Moreover, bandgaps, band alignment, and hydrogen adsorption calculations show that the designed cluster-based hybrid perovskites have potential as intermediate band materials for photovoltaics, and as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

TI High proton conductivity at low and moderate temperature in a simple
   family of Prussian blue analogs, divalent transition metal
   hexacyanocobaltates (III)
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Proton conductivity behavior was studied in a family of hexacyanocobaltates with divalent transition metals (II), HCCMs. The HCCMs, with molecular formula M-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot xH(2)O (where M = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn and Cd), had cubic crystal structures and similar cell parameters. The number of water molecules per formula unit (x) present in each HCCMs was determined from thermogravimetric analysis data. Differences in conductivity values were evaluated by running dielectric impedance experiments. The values of the permittivity and conductivity real and imaginary parts were obtained for each material. The actual conductivity part was analyzed as a temperature and frequency function. Mobilities, diffusivities, and ion charge densities were derived from the electrode polarization model that appropriately fits the loss tangent curves. The measurement conditions for all the samples were relative humidity of 99% and temperature ranging from 25 to 105 degrees C. The conductivity values obtained for the HCCMs varied from 10(-4) to 10(-2) S cm(-1). At low temperatures, proton conductivity values for the nickel hexacyanocobaltate (HCCNi) stood out (from 10(-3) and 10(-2) S cm(-1), at 25 and 45 degrees C, respectively), followed by Fe, Cd, Co and Mn. In addition to the results stated above, activation energies were determined using the Arrhenius model, where the obtained values were below 21.1 kJ mol(-1). The proton transport activation energies suggest that the transport through the HCCM porous framework was achieved by the Grotthuss mechanism. The diffusivity in the porous framework increased with temperature for all the samples except for HCCNi, following the trend D-HCCFe > D-HCCMn > D-HCCCo > D-HCCCd. The variability observed between the samples could be related to the ion-binding energies (E-b). These results indicate that hexacyanocobaltates can be useful as mixed matrix membrane (MMM) fillers, providing excellent conductivity and diffusivity when the medium contains a sufficient amount of ionic components depending on the involved transition metal.

TI A Green Approach to the Synthesis of Well-structured Prussian Blue Cubes
   for the Effective Electrocatalytic Reduction of Antiprotozoal Agent
   Coccidiostat Nicarbazin
SO ELECTROANALYSIS
AB For the first time, a robust electrochemical sensor to detect the coccidiostat nicarbazin (NCZ) is developed through the green synthesis of Prussian blue cubes from Volvariella volvacea (paddy straw mushroom) extract. Recently, numerous articles were reported about the issue that the prophylactic drugs were injected excessively as a feed additive for fattening the chickens in short period. It is a significant concern that the level of coccidiostat NCZ exceeds the residue limits in the tissues of the meat; mainly, in chicken and eggs. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a sensitive, reproducible and long-lasting sensor for the real-time detection of NCZ. Thus, we have generated an electrochemical sensor through the economic screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modification method. Eco-friendly Prussian blue cubes are fabricated on the carbon film of SPCE. As a result, the modified electrode showed exceptional electrocatalytic ability towards NCZ and the reduction peak currents are correlated to the concentrations of NCZ. It retains the more extensive working range between 1.25x10(-7) to 1.53x10(-3)molL(-1), and it possesses a very low limit of detection as well as the appreciable sensitivity. This method is successfully applied to the recognition of NCZ in the samples of chicken meat and eggs.

TI Tunable Intervalence Charge Transfer in Ruthenium Prussian Blue Analog
   Enables Stable and Efficient Biocompatible Artificial Synapses
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Emerging concepts for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and brain-computer interfacing inspire new research avenues aimed at understanding the relationship between oxidation state and conductivity in unexplored materials. This report expands the materials playground for neuromorphic devices to include a mixed valence inorganic 3D coordination framework, a ruthenium Prussian blue analog (RuPBA), for flexible and biocompatible artificial synapses that reversibly switch conductance by more than four orders of magnitude based on electrochemically tunable oxidation state. The electrochemically tunable degree of mixed valency and electronic coupling between N-coordinated Ru sites controls the carrier concentration and mobility, as supported by density functional theory computations and application of electron transfer theory to in situ spectroscopy of intervalence charge transfer. Retention of programmed states is improved by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to extensively studied organic polymers, thus reducing the frequency, complexity, and energy costs associated with error correction schemes. This report demonstrates dopamine-mediated plasticity of RuPBA synapses and biocompatibility of RuPBA with neuronal cells, evoking prospective application for brain-computer interfacing.

TI Recent advances and perspective in metal coordination materials-based
   electrode materials for potassium-ion batteries
SO RARE METALS
AB Recently, to ameliorate the forthcoming energy crisis, sustainable energy conversion and storage devices have been extensively investigated. Potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have aroused widespread attention in these very active research applications due to their earth abundance and similar low redox potential compared to Li-ion batteries (LIBs). It is critical to develop electrode materials with large ion diffusion channels and robust structures for long cycling performance in KIBs. Metal coordination materials, including metal-organic frameworks, Prussian blue, and Prussian blue analogue, as well as their composites and derivatives, are known as promising materials for high-performance KIBs due to their open frameworks, large interstitial voids, functionality and tailorability. In this review, we give an overview of the recent advances on the application of metal coordination materials in KIBs. In addition, the methods to enhance their K-ion storage properties are summarized and discussed, such as morphology engineering, doping, as well as compositing with other materials. Ultimately, some prospects for future research of metal coordination materials for KIBs are also proposed.

TI Nanoscale Morphology Control of Na-Rich Prussian Blue Cathode Materials
   for Sodium Ion Batteries with Good Thermal Stability
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are normally investigated at room temperature (RT). However, the application of electrical vehicles (EVs) may work at high/low temperatures in a harsh environment. Herein, Na-rich Prussian blue (PB) is synthesized by controlling the Na+ ion concentration during the synthesis process. TGA, XRD, IR, and SEM are used to investigate the transition of the nanoscale structure and the surface morphology of PB at various Na contents. The electrochemical properties have been investigated at RT, 40 degrees C, 60 degrees C, and the high temperature of 80 degrees C. PB-4M exhibits a specific capacity of 130 mAh/g at RT and 120 mAh/g at 80 degrees C. At 80 degrees C, PB-4M can still deliver a reversable specific capacity of 57 mAh/g at 2 C after 500 charge-discharge cycles, which makes it possible to utilize PB as a commercial cathode in future EVs at high temperature.

TI Etched High-Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues as Trifunctional Catalysts
   for Water, Ethanol, and Urea Electrooxidation
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB NH3 & BULL;H2O-etchedhigh-entropy PBAsare constructed to function as a trifunctional catalyst toward electrocatalyticOER, EOR, and UOR.
   The introduction of high-entropy and high specific surfaceareainto Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to create interest inthe field of electrocatalytic small-molecule oxidation reactions.Herein, we synthesize a novel class of high-entropy (HE) PBAs witha high specific surface area via a simple NH3 & BULL;H2O-etching strategy and systematically investigate the electrocatalyticperformance of HE-PBA toward electrocatalytic water, ethanol, andurea oxidation reactions. Importantly, the NH3 & BULL;H2O-etched HE-PBA (denoted as HE-PBA-e) demonstrated enhancedelectrocatalytic performance toward small-molecule oxidation comparedto the pristine HE-PBA, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) withpotentials of 1.56, 1.41, and 1.37 V for the oxygen evolution reaction(OER), ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), and urea oxidation reaction(UOR), respectively. Deep characterizations suggest that the NH3 & BULL;H2O etching treatment not only creates richnanopores to enlarge the surface area and boosts the mass transportand electron transfer but also facilitates the formation of high-valencemetal oxides to improve the intrinsic activity. This demonstrationof how systematically increasing the high oxidation state of metalswill serve as a governing principle for the rational design of moreadvanced HE-PBAs toward the electrooxidation of small molecules.

TI Hollow NiCoP nanocubes derived from a Prussian blue analogue
   self-template for high-performance supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have attracted great interest owing to the metallic properties and high specific capacities. Here, we designed hollow NiCoP nanocubes with increased specific surface area using a Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue as a self-template and NH3 center dot H2O as an etching agent. During the synthesis, both carbonization and phosphorization are completed in one step. The obtained hollow structure alleviates the volume variation of electrode material during reversible electrochemical reaction. Meanwhile, the residual carbon distributed uniformly in NiCoP at the molecular level, resulting in a high conductivity. DFT calculations further reveal that the electrical conductivity of NiCoP is superior to those of monometallic phosphide and metal oxide. Therefore, the optimized NiCoP-4-50 0 displays a high specific capacity (1590 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and outstanding cycling stability (78.2% retention after 12,000 cycles). Moreover, a prepared hybrid supercapacitor device delivers an energy density of 38.4 W h kg(-1) with a power density of 799.9 W kg(-1) at 1 A g(-1). The results indicate that the obtained high-performance TMPs with hollow structures have an application potential for energy storage devices. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Layered double hydroxides derived prussian blue analogue nanocage
   confining NiCoP nanoparticles as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Designing novel electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic activity for efficient water splitting is necessary to achieve the large-scale H-2/O-2 production from renewable resources. In this study, a facile hydrothermal method followed by low-temperature phosphorylation treatment was employed to fabricate a nanocage of prussian blue analogue encapsulating NiCoP nanoparticles (NiCoP@PBA), which was derived from the layered double hydroxide precursor. As a bifunctional non-precious metal electrocatalyst, NiCoP@PBA demonstrates superior performance in KOH electrolyte water splitting, with overpotentials of 59 mV for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 263 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2). The catalyst also exhibits low Tafel slopes of 54 mV dec(-1) for HER and 120 mV dec(-1) for OER, reflecting efficient charge transfer kinetics. DFT simulations show that the Co-N moieties at the heterogeneous interface of NiCoP@PBA can optimize the surface electron distribution and energy states, thus facilitating efficient electron-hole pair separation, significantly enhancing catalytic activity for both HER and OER process, and significantly extending the electrocatalyst's service life. Our approach can be extended to more non-precious metal electrocatalysts, which is significant for the design of efficient bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts.

TI Determining internal porosity in Prussian blue analogue cathode
   materials using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), A(x)M[M '(CN)(6)](1-y) center dot zH(2)O, are a highly functional class of materials with use in a broad range of applications, such as energy storage, due to their porous structure and tunable composition. The porosity is particularly important for the properties and is deeply coupled to the cation, water, and [M '(CN)(6)](n-) vacancy content. Determining internal porosity is especially challenging because the three compositional parameters are dependent on each other. In this work, we apply a new method, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), which can be employed for the characterization of defects and structural changes in crystalline materials. Four samples were prepared to evaluate the method's ability to detect changes in internal porosity as a function of the cation, water, and [M '(CN)(6)](n-) vacancy content. Three of the samples have identical [M '(CN)(6)](n-) vacancy content and gradually decreasing sodium and water content, while one sample has no sodium and 25% [M '(CN)(6)](n-) vacancies. The samples were thoroughly characterized using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Mossbauer spectroscopy as well as applying the PALS method. Mossbauer spectroscopy, XRD, and TGA analysis revealed the sample compositions Na1.8(2)Fe0.64(6)2+Fe0.36(10)2.6+[Fe2+(CN)(6)] center dot 2.09(2)H2O, Na1.1(2)Fe0.24(6)2+ Fe-0.76(6)(2.8+)[Fe2.3+(CN)(6)] center dot 1.57(1)H2O, Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] center dot 0.807(9)H2O, and Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.75) center dot 1.5H(2)O, confirming the absence of vacancies in the three main samples. It was shown that the final composition of PBAs could only be unambiguously confirmed through the combination of ICP, XRD, TGA, and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Two positron lifetimes of 205 and 405 ps were observed with the 205 ps lifetime being independent of the sodium, water, and/or [Fe(CN)(6)](n-) vacancy content, while the lifetime around 405 ps changes with varying sodium and water content. However, the origin and nature of the 405 ps lifetime yet remains unclear. The method shows promise for characterizing changes in the internal porosity in PBAs as a function of the composition and further development work needs to be carried out to ensure the applicability to PBAs generally.

TI High-performance electromagnetic wave absorption of NiCoFe/N-doped
   carbon composites with a Prussian blue analog (PBA) core at 2-18 GHz
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Structure design and assembly control are the two key factors in designing new microwave absorbing materials and improving their electromagnetic wave absorption (EMWA) performance; however, balancing the coordination between these factors remains a great challenge. In this manuscript, a coprecipitation method and an in-situ polymerization method were used to construct nitrogen-carbon-doped popcorn-like porous nanocomposites (NiCoFe/N-C). The metallic particles were encapsulated in approximately 10 layers of graphite carbon shells, and a NiCoFe/N-C core-shell structure was formed. The EMWA properties of the NiCoFe/N-C composites were adjusted by varying the divinylbenzene (DVB) to acrylonitrile (AN) content. The optimized NiCoFe/N-C composite showed a minimum reflection loss of -57.5 dB and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 5.44 GHz. The excellent EMWA properties of the NiCoFe/N-C composites can be attributed to the synergistic effect among the core-shell structure, popcorn-like structure, magnetic metal, carbon and nitrogen. This effect leads to enhanced impedance matching, interface polarization, dipole polarization, multiple reflection and scattering in the composites. In this paper, an effective strategy for the preparation of high-performance magnetic/dielectric composites is provided by carefully designing a new microstructure. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI Achieving a superior Na storage performance of Fe-based Prussian blue
   cathode by coating perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride amine
SO CARBON ENERGY
AB Fe-based Prussian blue (Fe-PB) cathode material shows great application potential in sodium (Na)-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity, long cycle life, low cost, and simple preparation process. However, the crystalline water and vacancies of Fe-PB lattice, the low electrical conductivity, and the dissolution of metal ions lead to limited capacity and poor cycling stability. In this work, a perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride amine (PTCDA) coating layer is successfully fabricated on the surface of Fe-PB by a liquid-phase method. The aminated PTCDA (PTCA) coating not only increases the specific surface area and electronic conductivity but also effectively reduces the crystalline water and vacancies, which avoids the erosion of Fe-PB by electrolyte. Consequently, the PTCA layer reduces the charge transfer resistance, enhances the Na-ion diffusion coefficient, and improves the structure stability. The PTCA-coated Fe-PB exhibits superior Na storage performance with a first discharge capacity of 145.2 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1. Long cycling tests exhibit minimal capacity decay of 0.027% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. Therefore, this PTCA coating strategy has shown promising competence in enhancing the electrochemical performance of Fe-PB, which can potentially serve as a universal electrode coating strategy for Na-ion batteries.
   Perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride amine layer has been successfully covered on the Fe-based Prussian blue (Fe-PB) surface for the first time, which increases the specific surface area and reduces crystal water with vacancies. Also, the coating layer enhances the transport ability of sodium ions with enhanced electronic conductivity, while inhibiting the dissolution of metal ions of electrodes. As a result, the as-synthesized Fe-PB have shown excellent cycling stability and impressive high capacity as sodium-ion battery cathodes. image

TI Enhanced removal of trace thallium by photo-promoted adsorption using
   Prussian blue@filter papers: Performance and mechanistic insights
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Developing highly efficient adsorbents for the removal of trace thallium(I) (Tl+) + ) is crucial for addressing environmental challenges. In this study, we successfully synthesized cubic Prussian blue (PB) loading on filter papers using an intermediate layer (dopamine/polyethyleneimine) via in-situ methods. The as-prepared PB-modified FP demonstrated outstanding anti-interference properties and light-enhanced adsorption performance for Tl+ + (0.5 mg/L) under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, exhibiting twice the effectiveness compared to dark conditions, even in acidic and coexisting ionic environments. This indicated its suitability for treating complex Tl+-contaminated +-contaminated water. Notably, the removal efficiency for trace Tl+ + was almost 100%, with a maximum experimental adsorption capacity of 86.2 mg/g after 1-h photo-promoted adsorption under 365 nm UV. Characterization results supported a proposed photo-driven redox mechanism that elucidated the interaction between Tl+ + and PB-modified FP. Specifically, the accelerated Fe(III) to Fe(II) redox reaction facilitated Tl+ + accommodation on the surface and/or lattice of PB, enhancing Tl+ + adsorption by compensating for missed positive charges. This study provides valuable insights into utilizing PB-based materials to enhance the photo-enhanced Tl+ + adsorption capacity in a cost-effective, easy-to-synthesize, and environmentally friendly manner.

TI Mo,Fe-codoped metal phosphide nanosheets derived from Prussian blue
   analogues for efficient overall water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Designing non-precious electrocatalysts with multiple active centers and durability toward overall water splitting is of great significance for storing renewable energy. This study reports a low-cost Mo, Fe codoped NiCoPx electrocatalysts derived from Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue and following phosphorization process. Benefitted from the optimized electronic configuration, hierarchical structure and abundant active sites, the Mo,Fe-NiCoPx/NF electrode has shown competitive oxygen evolution reaction (eta(10) = 197 mV) and hydrogen evolution reaction performance (eta(10)& nbsp;= 99 mV) when the current density is 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the integrated water splitting device assembled by Mo, Fe-NiCoPx/NF as both anode and cathode only needs a voltage of 1.545 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory results further confirm that the Mo, Fe codoped heterostructure can synergistically optimize the d-band center and Gibbs free energy during electrocatalytic processes, thus accelerating the kinetics of electrochemical water splitting. This work demonstrates the importance of rational combination of metal doping and interface engineering for advanced catalytic materials. (C)& nbsp;2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Prussian blue analogues derive yolk-shell structured magnetic
   carbon-based multicomponent nanocomposites toward excellent microwave
   absorption with tunable chemical composition
SO MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS
AB It is well recognized that making best of interfacial engineering and magnetic-dielectric synergistic effect is an effective strategy to improve microwave absorption. Herein, a series of cube-like yolk-shell structured magnetic carbon-based multicomponent nanocomposites (MCNCs) including CoNi@void@C, FeNi@void@C and FeCo@void@C could be selectively and successfully produced in large scale through a simple continuous process of coprecipitation, polymerization and thermal treatment, respectively. The obtained results indicated that the asprepared cube-like yolk-shell structured magnetic MCNCs were composed of black magnetic nanoparticles acting as core, void spaces as intermediate layer and thin obscure carbon layer serving as shell. Owing to the excellent impedance matching and electromagnetic wave loss characteristics, the obtained CoNi@void@C, FeNi@void@C and FeCo@void@C MCNCs displayed the outstanding comprehensive electromagnetic wave absorption performances including strong absorption capabilities, broad absorption bandwidths and thin matching thicknesses. Especially, the obtained FeCo@void@C presented a minimum reflection loss of -54.32 dB with a matching thickness of 1.90 mm, and the effective bandwidth can reach 5.60 GHz with a matching thickness of 1.96 mm. Therefore, our findings not only provided a universal and alternative approach to produce yolk-shell structured magnetic carbon-based MCNCs, but also presented an effective pathway to take full advantage of interfacial and magnetic-dielectric synergistic effects to develop the tunable, broadband, strong absorption, lightweight high-efficiency microwave absorbers.

TI Prussian blue analogues-derived Ni-doped CoFe2O4 hollow nanocubes as
   electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely restricts the generation of O2 due to complex reaction mechanism; improving the efficiency and stability of catalysts remains a longstanding gauntlet. To replace noble metals, bimetallic oxides are promising OER catalysts owing to their natural abundant reserves and favorable catalytic activity. Herein, nickel-doped CoFe2O4 (Ni@CoFe2O4) hollow nanocubes are synthesized by controlled pyrolysis of prussian blue analogues at low temperature and employed as OER catalyst for water splitting and lithium oxygen battery. Specifically, the prepared sample has a porous hollow cubic architecture, which is conducive to accelerating the substance and electron transport, providing abundant active sites and large electrolyte contact area. The Ni doping and resultant oxygen vacancies can tune the electronic structure and improve the conductivity and intrinsic activity of metal oxides. Benefiting from the special structural design and multi-metal synergy, the OER overpotential of Ni@CoFe2O4 nanocubes for water splitting is 415 mV@100 mA cm-2 with a good stability. The Li-O2 cells assembled with Ni@CoFe2O4 nanocubes also exhibit superior electrochemical properties with a charge/discharge capacity of 12453/11976 mAh g-1 and OER/ORR overpotentials of 1.04/ 0.37 V. This work proposes new insights for the structural design and composition modulation of metal oxide to promote the OER kinetics.

TI A bimetallic (Cu-Co) Prussian Blue analogue loaded with gold
   nanoparticles for impedimetric aptasensing of ochratoxin a
SO MICROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Bimetallic (Cu-Co) Prussian Blue analogs (PBAs) were coupled to gold nanoparticles to give a nanocomposite of type AuNP@CuCoPBA. It is shown to be a viable material for the impedimetric aptamer-based determination of ochratoxin A (OTA). Basic characterizations revealed that the chemical composition and crystal structure of AuNP@CuCoPBA is similar to that of pristine CuCo PBA. Nevertheless, the nanocube shape of CoCu PBA is converted to small nanoparticles on addition of AuNPs. Compared with CuCoPBA-based aptasensor, the AuNP@CuCoPBA-based assay exhibits excellent electrochemical conductivity, strong aptamer binding interaction, and high G-quadruplex stability. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the assay has limits of detection as low as 5.2fgmL(-1) of OTA, a response in the 50fgmL(-1) to 10ngmL(-1) concentration range, high selectivity, good reproducibility, repeatability, and acceptable applicability. In our perception, it represents a universal and powerful method for aptamer strand immobilization. It may be applied to the determination of various other analytes for which aptamers are available.

TI Prussian-Blue Analogue-Derived Hollow Structured
   Co3S4/CuS2/NiS2 Nanocubes as
   an Advanced Battery-Type Electrode Material for High-Performance Hybrid
   Supercapacitors
SO SMALL
AB The facile and cost-effective fabrication of hybrid nanostructures comprised of hollow mixed metallic chalcogenides has attracted growing interest in the development of high-performance energy storage devices. Herein, multi-component (nickel-cobalt-copper-sulfides/selenides (NCCS/NCCSe)) hollow nanocubes (HNCs) are prepared via a single-step sulfurization/selenization process. The NCCS material shows interior HNCs, and the NCCSe material exhibits slightly formed porous cubes. Both the prepared materials demonstrate higher charge storage performance than the precursor NCC NCs owing to the improved surface morphology and addition of sulfur and selenium ions. Particularly, the NCCS HNCs electrode reveals superior specific capacity (capacitance) (70.32 mAh g(-1) (666.20 F g(-1)) at 5 mA cm(-2)) along with excellent cycling stability of 108.6% even after 10 000 cycles. Interestingly, the electrode delivers a good rate capability of 83.5% at a high current density of 20 mA cm(-2). The feasibility of the battery-type NCCS HNCs as a positive electrode is explored by constructing an aqueous electrochemical hybrid capacitor (AEHC). The AEHC exhibits maximum energy and power densities of 23.15 Wh kg(-1) and 7899.08 W kg(-1), respectively. Remarkably, it demonstrates superior long-life cycling stability even after 10 000 cycles (120.6% retention). The suitability of AEHC for practical application is also tested by driving electronic devices.

TI Synthesis of amorphous boride nanosheets by the chemical reduction of
   Prussian blue analogs for efficient water electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Exploring efficient and earth-abundant bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is of paramount significance for clean and sustainable hydrogen energy generation. In this work, amorphous Co-Ni-B-O nanosheets (CNBO-NSs) are synthesized by the chemical reduction of bimetallic Prussian blue analogues (Co-Ni PBAs) using sodium borohydride. The as-prepared CNBO-NSs exhibit excellent electrochemical catalytic activity and stability. They can steadily afford 10 mA cm(-2) current density at overpotentials of 140 mV for hydrogen evolution and 300 mV for oxygen evolution during 24 h operation. The formation of a metal-boron bond and the improved surface area along with the enhanced conductivity in the resultant CNBO-NS structures are factors responsible for the enhanced catalytic activities. This work could offer new clues for the utilization of metal-organic frameworks for designing functional nanomaterials, and more importantly valuable insights into crystallinity engineering in efficient electrolysis for energy conversion and beyond.

TI Atomic Scale Evidence of the Switching Mechanism in a Photomagnetic CoFe
   Dinuclear Prussian Blue Analogue
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Molecular complexes based on Prussian Blue analogues have recently attracted considerable interest for their unique bistable properties combined to ultimately reduced dimensions. Here, we investigate the first dinuclear FeCo complex exhibiting both thermal and photomagnetic bistability in the solid state. Through an experimental and theoretical approach combining local techniques-X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and ligand field multiplet calculations-we were able to evidence the changes occurring at the atomic scale in the electronic and magnetic properties. The spectroscopic studies were able to fully support at the atomic level the following conclusions: (i) the 300 K phase and the light-induced excited state at 4 K are both built from Fe-LS(III)-Co-HS(II) paramagnetic pairs with no apparent reorganization of the local structure, (ii) the 100 K phase is composed of Fe-LS(II)-Co-LS(III) diamagnetic pairs, and (iii) the light-induced excited state is fully relaxed at an average temperature of approximate to 50 K. In the paramagnetic phase at 2 K, XAS and XMCD reveal that both Fe and Co ions exhibit a rather large orbital magnetic moment (0.65 mu(B) and 0.46 mu(B), respectively, under an external magnetic induction of 6.5 T), but it was not possible to detect a magnetic interaction between spin centers above 2 K.

TI A Prussian blue analog as a decorporation agent for the simultaneous
   removal of cesium and reactive oxygen species
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Radioactive cesium (Cs) is a significant concern due to its role as a major byproduct of nuclear fission and its potential for radioactive contamination. Internal contamination with radioactive Cs is characterized by immoderate production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in severe radiation damage. Therefore, the development of therapeutic strategies should focus on enhancing the excretion of radioactive Cs and reducing radiation-induced oxidative damage. However, current therapeutic drugs like Prussian blue (PB) have limited efficacy in addressing these issues. In this study, we present Cu3[Fe(CN)6]2 (CuFe) nanoparticles, a Prussian blue analog (PBA), which can not only efficiently sequester Cs but also exhibit resistance against radiation damage. The results of the adsorption studies demonstrate that CuFe outperforms PB in terms of adsorption performance. Further mechanistic investigations indicate that the increased adsorption capacity of CuFe may be attributed to the presence of additional defects resulting from the [Fe(CN)6] missing linkers. Moreover, CuFe mimics the functions of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by effectively eliminating O2- and H2O2 while scavenging OH, thereby mitigating ROS induced by radiative Cs. Importantly, in vivo study confirms the efficient Cs decorporation capability of CuFe. The fecal cumulative excretion rate of CuFe reaches 69.5%, which is 1.45 times higher than that of PB (48.8%). These findings demonstrate that CuFe exhibits excellent Cs removal performance and ROS scavenging ability, making it an attractive candidate for the treatment of Cs contamination.

TI Prussian blue analogues derived Fe-NiCoP reveals the cooperation of Fe
   doping and phosphating for enhancing OER activity
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The development of high-efficiency earth-rich and non-precious metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reactions is a critical and essential challenge. In this paper, Fe-doped NiCoP is prepared by phosphating iron-doped NiCo Prussian blue analogs (Fe-NiCo PBA) as a highly effective catalyst for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fe-NiCoP exhibits superior OER performance with a low overpotential (266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) owing to the synergistic effect of Fe doping and phosphating. The Fe doping mainly decreases the energy barrier of the OH* dehydrogenation step, while phosphating significantly reduces the energy barrier of the OH adsorption step. This work reveals the mechanism of the synergistic effect of Fe doping and phosphating on catalysts and provides a new strategy for synthesizing metal-doped transition metal phosphides.

TI Construction of high stabilization PBAs-Cu@MS as a platform for
   high-efficiency and selective removal of Cs(I)
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are widely considered as an auspicious material for Cs+ separation to deal with water pollution. However, the noxious presence of cyanide contamination derive from the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) in alkaline solutions presents a grave threat to environmental safety. In this study, the instability and cyanide release problems of PBAs-Cu under alkaline conditions were remedied by coating the outside of PBAs-Cu with Mesoporous Silica (MS). The newly designed PBAs-Cu@MS composite is highly stable in a wide pH range (2 <= pH <= 13), has a high Cs+ adsorption capacity (84.98 mg/g), and can effectively remove 97.1% of Cs(I) selectively, as demonstrated by systematic adsorption tests in complex wastewater systems. PBAs-Cu@MS has excellent regeneration performance to be 86.4% after 5 recycles. Furthermore, as confirmed by XRD and free cyanide analysis, even at pH 13, the crystallization and chemical stability of PBAs-Cu@MS is extremely high. MS is a useful protective element for the stabilization of PBAs. Considering its cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, easy preparation and efficient selective removal performance, PBAs-Cu@MS holds great promise in selective removal of Cs+ from complex wastewater systems.

TI A ZIF-8 modified Prussian blue cathode material for sodium-ion batteries
   with long cycling life and excellent storage stability
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Prussian blue analogues have been intensely investigated as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries owing to their high capacities, easy synthesis and low cost. However, the poor cycling performance due to the presence of lattice defects and the structural deterioration when exposed to humid air hinder their practical application. Herein we report an effective surface modification method to tackle these issues. A Zinc-zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) modified PB sample is prepared by in-situ growth via simple wet chemical reaction. The obtained PB@ZIF-8 composite with a ZIF-8 coating layer of similar to 70 nm thickness on the 2-5 mu m PB particle surface shows excellent cycling stability with reversible capacity of 106.5 mAh g(-1) at 1C charge-discharge rate and a remarkable capacity retention of 96.7 % after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the PB@ZIF-8 composite shows excellent storage stability owing to its moisture-proof property. After exposure to high humidity air (RH=70 %) for 24 h or storage for 180 days in a bottle filled with air of relative humidity RH=40 %, the PB@ZIF-8 sample still maintains excellent cycling performance. ZIF-8 coating layer not only acts as a shield for PB particles against the electrolyte corrosion, but also resists the H2O attacking in humid environment.

TI Capacitance-dominated hierarchical porous three-dimensional carbon
   framework enhanced Prussian blue analogue as superior cathode for
   sodium-ion batteries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The 3D framework carbon is an ideal host of active materials for energy storage batteries. In this work, KxNayMn[Fe(CN)6] (KNMF) nanocubes were in-situ grown on hierarchical porous 3D framework carbon (3DFC) to construct a composite cathode (KNMF@3DFC) for sodium-ion batteries. Owing to the hierarchical porous structure and large specific surface area, the highly conductive 3DFC offers abundant active sites for sodium storage and contributes to extra capacity. The considerable content of surface capacitance-dominated sodium storage of KNMF@3DFC composite cathode reveals faster charge transfer and better reaction kinetics, conducing to its rate capability. Ex-situ XRD/Raman measurements further reveal well structural stability of KNMF@3DFC during the whole cycle. Consequently, the KNMF@3DFC composite electrode reveals excellent rate performance and superior long-term cycling stability. Combining active materials with 3D framework carbon to enable a capacitance-dominated sodium storage mechanism is a promising strategy to stimulate the development of advanced electrode materials.

TI Polyaniline-modified amorphous tin-based Prussian blue analogue as
   cathodes for long-life aqueous zinc ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have emerged in the field of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) owing to their simple synthesis method and three-dimensional open framework structure. Although PBAs have high redox potentials, the unsatisfactory specific capacity and poor electrical conductivity limit their development to some extent. In this work, amorphous tin hexacyanoferrate (SnHCF) and polyaniline (PANI) were combined to form SnHCF/PANI composite. The synergistic effect of the amorphous structure of SnHCF and PANI with good conductivity makes the SnHCF/PANI electrode exhibit excellent redox activity and achieve rapid ion/electron transfer. When used as a cathode in AZIBs, the SnHCF/PANI provides a high specific capacity (136.8 mAh g- 1 at 0.5 A g- 1) and excellent cycling stability (a discharge specific capacity of 54.3 mAh g- 1 after 2500 cycles at 2 A g- 1). This work offers a new idea for the development of PBAs-based composites as cathode materials for AZIBs.

TI Understanding temperature and magnetic-field actuated magnetization
   polarity reversal in the Prussian blue analogue
   Cu0.73Mn0.77[Fe(CN)6]•zH2</
   sub>O, using XMCD
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB We have investigated the microscopic origin of temperature and magnetic-field actuated magnetization reversal in Cu0.73Mn0.77[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot zH(2)O, using XMCD. Our results show a fair deviation from the mean-field-theory in the form of different ordering temperatures of Fe and Mn sublattices. A preferential sign reversal of Mn spin under magnetic field and different spin cant angles for the two sublattices have also been observed. An antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe and Mn sublattices along with different ordering temperatures (sublattice decoupling) for these sublattices explain the temperature-dependent magnetization reversal. Whereas, Mn spin reversal alone (under external magnetic field) is responsible for the observed field-dependent magnetization reversal. The dissimilar magnetic behavior of Fe and Mn sublattices in this cubic 3d-orbital system has been understood by invoking disparity and competition among inter-sublattice magnetic control parameters, viz. magnetic Zeeman energy, exchange coupling constant and magnetic anisotropy constant. Our results have significant design implications for future magnetic switches, by optimizing the competition among these magnetic control parameters.

TI Investigation of high-entropy Prussian blue analog as cathode material
   for aqueous sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (ARSIBs) have received considerable attention as promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their safety, environmental friendliness, low cost, and high charge/discharge capacities. Development of novel electrode materials remains a central area of research in this field. In this study, we developed a high-entropy Prussian blue analog (HEPBA) as a cathode material for ARSIBs. High-entropy doping has been confirmed to reduce water content and regulate the spin state of PBAs, thereby enhancing their electrochemical performance. DFT calculations showed that high-entropy doping considerably narrowed the bandgap of the material, decreased the difficulty of electron excitation to the conduction band, and enhanced the electron migration ability. The assembled NaTi2(PO4)3@C||1 M Na2SO4||HEPBA full cells exhibited better long-term cycling and rate performance than nickel hexacyanoferrate with a capacity of 75 mA h g-1 at 0.5C and a retention rate of 87% after 1000 cycles at 1C. Even at a high rate of 10C, the full cells achieved an initial capacity of 57.1 mA h g-1 and a remaining capacity of 47.4 mA h g-1 after 5000 cycles.

TI Enzyme-catalyzed deposition of polydopamine for amplifying the signal
   inhibition to a novel Prussian blue-nanocomposite and ultrasensitive
   electrochemical immunosensing
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The uncontrollable synthesis of Prussian blue (PB) and its weak stability toward OH- are great challenges affecting its electrochemical biosensing application. Herein we utilize the unique properties of chitosan (CS) to realize the facile and controllable synthesis of a CS-PB nanocomposite and combine it with the urease-catalyzed deposition of polydopamine (PDA) for amplifying the electrochemical signal inhibition of PB to develop a novel immunosensing method for protein detection. The immunosensor was constructed on a CS-PB modified electrode, and a urease-functionalized silica nanoprobe was prepared for tracing its sandwich immunoassay toward the model analyte of carcinoembryonic antigen. Besides the electrochemical impedance effect of the quantitatively captured nanoprobes, their enzymatic reaction can release numerous OH- to destroy the PB crystals and also induce the PDA deposition onto the immunosensor. These caused drastic electrochemical signal inhibition to PB. Based on the above multi-signal amplification mechanism, the method exhibits a very low detection limit of 0.042 pg mL(-1) along with a very wide linear range of six-order of magnitude. In addition, the CS-PB based immunosensor has excellent specificity, repeatability, stability and reliability. Thus this PB nanocomposite and the proposed electrochemical immunosensing method reveal a promising potential for future applications.

TI Constructing Asymmetric Charge Polarized NiCo Prussian Blue Analogue for
   Promoted Electrocatalytic Methanol to Formate Conversion
SO SMALL
AB The highly selective electrochemical conversion of methanol to formate is of great significance for various clean energy devices, but understanding the structure-to-property relationship remains unclear. Here, the asymmetric charge polarized NiCo prussian blue analogue (NiCo PBA-100) is reported to exhibit remarkable catalytic performance with high current density (210 mA cm-2 @1.65 V vs RHE) and Faraday efficiency (over 90%). Meanwhile, the hybrid water splitting and Zinc-methanol-battery assembled by NiCo PBA-100 display the promoted performance with decent stability. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and operando Raman spectroscopy indicate that the asymmetric charge polarization in NiCo PBA leads to more unoccupied states of Ni and occupied states of Co, thereby facilitating the rapid transformation of the high-active catalytic centers. Density functional theory calculations combining operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrate that the final reconstructed catalyst derived by NiCo PBA-100 exhibits rearranged d band properties along with a lowered energy barrier of the rate-determining step and favors the desired formate production.
   The asymmetric charge polarized NiCo PBA with different occupying states of Ni and Co atoms can quickly transform to high active Co doped Ni hydroxide towards alkaline methanol oxidation reaction. The obtained final catalyst exhibits an ideal electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction and Zinc-methanol-air battery.image

TI Interplay between core and shell in a RbCoFe@RbNiCo Prussian blue
   analogue spin transition heterostructure
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB A series of core-shell heterostructures consisting of the spin transition Prussian blue analogue RbaCob[Fe(CN)(6)](c)center dot mH(2)O (RbCoFe-PBA) as core with different shell thicknesses of KjNik[Co(CN)(6)](l)center dot nH(2)O (KNiCo-PBA) has been prepared and studied as the cores undergo both thermal and light-induced phase changes. Synchrotron powder diffraction and SQUID magnetometry indicate the intersite cooperativity of the charge transfer coupled spin transition (CTCST) in the RbCoFe-PBA core decreases while the extent of lattice contraction is reduced relative to the uncoated particles. Isothermal relaxation measurements from the photo-induced high-spin (HS) state to the low-spin (LS) ground state of the RbCoFe-PBA core show that the energy barrier of the HS to LS transition dramatically decreases when adding the KNiCo-PBA shells, becoming smaller when the shell is thicker. The RbCoFe-PBA@KNiCo-PBA series is unique because the lattice parameter of KNiCo-PBA grown on the high-spin RbCoFe-PBA core particle is expanded relative to its equilibrium lattice parameter. As a result, the lattice mismatch is relieved during the spin transition. Analysis of the structural microstrain in both core and shell during the CTCST process reveals the different mechanisms by which the heterostructure accommodates the strain.

TI Hierarchical Hollow Prussian Blue Rods Synthesized via Self-Sacrifice
   Template as Cathode for High Performance Sodium Ion Battery
SO SMALL METHODS
AB In this work, a facile strategy is proposed to synthesize hierarchical hollow rod-like Mn-doped Prussian blue (R-PB) using MnO2 nanosheets as a self-sacrifice template. The as prepared R-PB with low contents of vacancies and coordinated water, and high content of sodium, exhibits appealing electrochemical performance as a cathode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) achieving a high discharge capacity of 117.3 mAh g(-1) and a capacity retention of 98.5% after 200 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, the specific capacity reaches 111.5 mAh g(-1) at 5 C with a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 93.8%. The high capacity, superior cycling stability, and enhanced kinetics of Na+ migration of R-PB are attributed to the positive effect of doped Mn ions and the hierarchical hollow rod-like structure. The doped Mn ions in R-PB activate the redox of Fe-LS(C) in the high voltage region to reach a high capacity. The unique hierarchical hollow rod-like structure provides a buffer space for the volume change during the insertion/extraction of sodium ions, enlarges the contact area between the electrode materials and electrolyte, and enhances the apparent diffusion coefficient of sodium ions in electrode materials.

   obtained by calcining Prussian blue analogues as anodes for lithium-ion

SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Mixed transitional oxides have attracted increasing attention as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of their enhanced lithium storage properties than single metal oxides. In this work, porous Co(x)Fe(3-x)O(4)nanocubes were successfully constructed by a facile two-step method using a cobalt-iron-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA) synthesized at room temperature as a precursor. The Co(x)Fe(3-x)O(4)nanocubes fabricated at different temperatures possessed diverse surface areas and pore volumes. When applied as LIB anode materials, the Co(x)Fe(3-x)O(4)nanocubes synthesized at 700 degrees C delivered the highest reversible capacity of about 1601 mA h g(-1)at 100 mA g(-1)after 60 cycles and exhibited the best rate capability with a capacity of 950 mA h g(-1)at a high current density of 5000 mA g(-1). The enhanced electrochemical performance could be attributed to the structural feature of large amounts of nanopores within the nanocubes, which could provide a large space for buffer volume expansion during Li(+)insertion/extraction processes and improve the structure stability.

Here we review the relevant structural aspects of the cyanide coordination polymers, mainly PBA, the most studied subfamily up to date, to describe this family of compounds better. Their porous nature, large surface area, cavities, and tunable composition stand out as attractive properties of PBA or hybrid-PBA for water and air decontamination.

A section is dedicated to the different engineering strategies of PBA, where the synergy between the components enhances the properties and performance of the new materials. The use of these compounds in adsorption, ionic exchange, desalinization, and advanced oxidation processes is described based on the tight structure-properties-functionality relationship. Some final considerations on the future potentials and limitations of cyanide coordination polymers are given from the authors' point of view.

TI Electron Conduction in Nanoparticle Agglomerates Limits Apparent
   Na<SUP>+</SUP> Diffusion in Prussian Blue Analogue Porous Electrodes
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Prussian Blue and its analogues (PBAs) are promising cation intercalation materials for energy storage and environmental applications. Here, we investigate Na+ diffusion in porous electrodes comprised of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) PBA nanoparticles (NPs), conductive carbon additive, and polymer binder. We combine experimental characterization, an electronically limited version of porous electrode theory, and simulation to link rate limitations in galvanostatic cycling to electron conduction through NP agglomerates. Using potentiostatic intermittent titration (PITT), we find that the apparent diffusion coefficient of Na+ within NiHCF electrodes varies non-monotonically between 10(-11)cm(2)/sec (at 50% degree of intercalation, DOI) and 10(-10)cm(2)/sec (at DOI s of 0% and 100%). Galvanostatic cycling of electrodes with different average NP-agglomerate sizes reveals that two-fold higher rate capability is achievable when agglomerate radius reduces two-fold, despite having the same NP size distribution. We subsequently introduce and validate theory that explains the variation of diffusion coefficient with DOI, yielding a simple expression for the apparent diffusion coefficient that is proportional to the effective electronic conductivity through NP agglomerates. Finally, using DOI-dependent PITT data we model galvanostatic (dis)charge through electroactive spheres and show agreement with experimental results, confirming that electron conduction through NP agglomerates limits the rate capability of NiHCF electrodes.

TI High-entropy selenides derived from Prussian blue analogues as electrode
   materials for sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Transition metal selenides (TMS) have received much attention as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacity and excellent redox reversibility. However, their further development is constrained by the dissolution of transition metal ions and substantial volume changes experienced during cycling. Herein, the high-entropy Prussian blue analogues were selenized by the vapor infiltration method, resulting in the formation of a core-shell structured high-entropy selenides (HESe-6). The core-shell structure with voids and abundant selenium vacancies on the surface effectively mitigates bulk expansion and enhances electronic conductivity. Furthermore, the high-entropy property endows an ultra-stable crystal structure and inhibits the dissolution of metal ions. The ex-situ EIS and in-situ XRD results show that HESe-6 is able to be reversibly transformed into highly conductive ultrafine metal particles upon Na+ embedding, providing more Na+ reactive active sites. In addition, despite the incorporation of up to seven different elements, it exhibits minimal phase transitions during discharge/charge cycles, effectively mitigating stress accumulation. HESe-6 could retain an ultralong-term stability of 765.83 mAh g-1 after 1000 loops even at 1 A g-1. Furthermore, when coupled with the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode, it maintains a satisfactory charge energy density of 303 Wh kg- 1 after 300 cycles, which shows promising application prospect in the future.

TI Prussian Blue Analogue/FeCoNi-Layered Double Hydroxide Nanorod Arrays on
   Nickel Foam for Urea Electrolysis
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB To overcome the high potential required for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), the use of urea oxidation as an alternative to OER has attracted attention. It not only can reduce energy consumption caused by the high overpotential of OER but also simultaneously removes the urea present in polluted water, having a huge potential in industrial applications. Ni- and Fe-based transition metal hydroxides have been shown to be significantly effective in OER and urea oxidation reactions (UORs). Herein, by using FeCoNi layered double hydroxide (FeCoNi-LDH) nanorods as the precursor, we successfully develop the Prussian blue analogue (PBA)/FeCoNi-LDH nanorods grown uniformly on the surface of nickel foam (NF). The obtained electrocatalyst PBA/ FeCoNi-LDH/NF nanorods as the anode could provide a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at the applied potential of 1.383 V in 1.0 M KOH solution with 0.5 M only 1.52 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) to afford the same current density. The high conductivity and 3D porous structure created by the Ni substrate can lead to superior electrocatalytic activity. Nanoarrays are constructed intimately with the base and allow the rapid escape of newly produced gas molecules, and a large number of active sites and rapid charge transfer can be induced by the introduction of sodium nitroprusside.

TI Transference function for electro-insertion reactions in blue energy
   devices and acid-base machines
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB We propose a model in the frequency domain to determine kinetic and thermodynamic parameters directed to ion electro-insertion in host matrices, aiming to couple reaction mechanisms and mass transport in transference functions. We use Maclaurin series to expand the electrical current as a function of the potential and the ion concentration gradient within the host matrix, to obtain an analytical solution in the frequency domain. The parameters associated with non-faradaic processes can also be inserted in the transference function. The model can aid better comprehension of energy harvesting from blue energy devices and acid-base machines: dissipated energy, maximum work, practical work, potential rise, and efficiency can be estimated for different combinations of ionic concentration in solution. We investigate sodium ion electro-insertion in a copper Prussian blue analogue as an example of application of the model. The method presented here may contribute to the proposition of host matrices with suitable properties. In turn, the proposed host matrices will help to improve how these devices and machines perform, thereby ensuring that energy harvesting is efficient, and that environmental preservation is stimulated.

TI Lithiated Prussian blue analogues as positive electrode active materials
   for stable non-aqueous lithium-ion batteries
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are appealing active materials for post-lithium electrochemical energy storage. However, PBAs are not generally suitable for non-aqueous Li-ion storage due to their instability upon prolonged cycling. Herein, we assess the feasibility of PBAs with various lithium content for non-aqueous Li-ion storage. We determine the crystal structure of the lithiated PBAs via neutron powder diffraction measurements and investigate the influence of water on structural stability and Li-ion migration through operando X-ray diffraction measurements and bond valence simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a positive electrode containing Li2-xFeFe(CN)(6)center dot nH(2)O (0 <= x <= 2) active material coupled with a Li metal electrode and a LiPF6-containing organic-based electrolyte in coin cell configuration delivers an initial discharge capacity of 142 mAh g(-1) at 19 mA g(-1) and a discharge capacity retention of 80.7% after 1000 cycles at 1.9 A g(-1). By replacing the lithium metal with a graphite-based negative electrode, we also report a coin cell capable of cycling for more than 370 cycles at 190 mA g(-1) with a stable discharge capacity of about 105 mAh g(-1) and a discharge capacity retention of 98% at 25 degrees C.

TI Quantification of EGFR and EGFR-overexpressed cancer cells based on
   carbon dots@bimetallic CuCo Prussian blue analogue
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB A new bimetallic CuCo Prussian blue analogue (CuCo PBA) loaded with carbon dots (CDs) was prepared (represented by CD@CuCoPBA) and developed as a scaffold for anchoring the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) aptamer to detect EGFR and living EGFR-overexpressed cancer cells. The basic characterizations revealed CuCo PBA exhibited nanocube shape and still remained its nanostructure and physical/chemical properties after coupling with large amounts of CDs. As compared with the pristine CuCo PBA, the CD@CuCoPBA displayed good electrochemical activity, strong binding interaction toward aptamer, and high stability of aptamer-EGFR G-quadruplex in aqueous solution. As such, the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements indicated that the CD@CuCoPBA-based aptasensor displayed an ultra-low detection limit toward EGFR (0.42 fg mL(-1)) and living EGFR-overexpressed MCF-7 cancer cells (80 cell per mL), as well as high selectivity, good reproducibility, high stability, repeatability, and acceptable applicability. Consequently, the constructed CD@CuCoPBA-based aptasensor can be extended to be a promising universal method for early diagnosis of cancers.

TI Separator of polyacrylonitrile modified with Prussian blue analogs for
   high-efficiency aqueous zinc-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Because of their safety and cost-effectiveness, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have emerged as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage applications. However, Zn dendrite growth on metallic zinc anodes severely affects their cycling stability and coulombic efficiency. Herein, a polyacrylonitrile separator modified with FeNi-based Prussian blue analog (FeNi-PBA@PAN) was rationally designed and prepared, which could serve as an ion sieve for AZIBs. Its inherent robust cationic sites hamper the mobility of SO42- anions, whereas the mobility of Zn2+ is improved with a transference number of 0.81, resulting in a homogeneous Zn2+ flux and interfacial electric field on the surface of the zinc anode, thus suppressing the growth of Zn dendrites. The assembled Zn & Vert;Zn symmetric battery using FeNi-PBA@PAN as a separator exhibits highly reversible plating/stripping behavior with a prolonged cycle life of over 2700 hours at a current density of 1 mA cm-2. Moreover, the Zn|FeNi-PBA@PAN|MnO2/CNT full battery shows increased specific capacity and sustained durability, showcasing an impressive capacity retention rate of 81% even after undergoing 2000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g-1. Our study thus paves a new avenue for the design and development of new separators for AZIBs without zinc dendrites.
   FeNi-PBA improves battery life by limiting the movement of SO42- ions and equalizing the electric field on the anode surface.

TI Rational Synthesis of Hollow Prussian Blue Analogue Through Coordination
   Replication and Controlled-Etching for Cs-Ion Removal
SO JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Radioactive cesium pollution have received considerable attention due to the increasing risks in development of the nuclear power plants in the world. Although various functional porous materials are utilized to adsorb Cs+ ions in water, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are an impressive class of candidates because of their super affinity of Cs+ ions. The adsorption ability of the PBAs strongly relate to the mesostructure and interstitial sites. To design a hollow PBA with large number of interstitial sites, the traditional hollowing methods are not suitable owing to the difficulty in processing the specific PBAs with large number of interstitial sites. In this work, we empolyed a rational strategy which was to form a "metal oxide"@" PBA" core-shell structure via coordination replication at first, then utilized a mild etching to remove the metal oxide core, led to hollow PBA finally. The obtained hollow PBAs were of high crystallinity and large number of interstitial sites, showing a super adsorption performance for Cs+ ions (221.6 mg/g) within a short period (10 min).

TI Highly scalable acid-base resistant Cu-Prussian blue metal-organic
   framework for C2H2/C2H4, biogas, and flue gas separations
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB One of the emerging problems plaguing the chemical industry today is the selective capture and separation of gases from their mixtures in an efficient and cost-effective manner. MOFs are new-age physisorbent materials extensively investigated for various gas mixture separations (such as biogas, flue gas, olefin/paraffin etc.); however, face the challenge of separations in a realistic environment. Here, we have investigated one of the Prussian blue analogues (Cu-PSB) to explore its potential as energy-efficient gas separation material. Cu-PSB can easily be scaled up at room temperature from water and is highly robust under harsh acidic, basic environments (pH = 1-11, 6 M HCl, 18 M H2SO4), exhibiting excellent separation of C2H2/C2H4, biogas (CO2:CH4 = 50:50), and flue gas (CO2:N2 = 15:85) mixtures. The IAST selectivity at ambient conditions (295 K, 50:50 mixture) could reach up to 5.2 for C2H2/C2H4, 14.7 for CO2/CH4, and 60.5 for the CO2/N2 (15:85 mixture). Such high C2H2 and CO2 uptake capacity and separation selectivity could be attributed to the synergistic effect of open CuII sites and the multiple H-bonding interactions within the functional pore channels of optimal pore size. Further, breakthrough simulation confirmed the complete separations from their binary mixtures, thus proving to be highly useful for the C2H2/C2H4 separation and CO2 capture from the bio and post-combustion flue gas mixtures. CuPSB was found to be even a more robust framework than ZIF-8 and UiO-66 MOFs.

TI Enlightening the Alkali Ion Role in the Photomagnetic Effect of FeCo
   Prussian Blue Analogues
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB FeCo Prussian blue analogues of general formula A(x)Co(y)[Fe(CN)(6)](z) are responsive, non-stoichiometric materials whose magnetic and optical properties can be reversibly switched by light irradiation. However, elucidating the critical influence of the inserted alkali ion, A(+), on the material's properties remains complicated due to their complex local structure. Here, by investigating soluble A subset of [Fe-4-Co-4] cyanido cubes (A = K, Rb, and Cs), both accurate structural and electronic information could be obtained. First, X-ray diffraction analyses reveal distinct interactions between the inserted A(+) ions and the {Fe-4-Co-4} box, which impacts the structural distortion in the cubic framework. These distortions vanish, and a displacement of the small K+ ion from a corner toward the center is observed, as a cobalt corner Co-HS(II) is oxidized to Co-LS(III). Second, cyclic voltammetry experiments performed at variable temperatures show distinct splitting of the Co-HS(II) double left right arrow Co-LS(III) peak potentials for the different A(+) cations, which can be qualitatively linked to different thermodynamic (standard potentials) and kinetic (energy barriers) parameters associated with the structural reorganization accompanying this redox-coupled spin state change. Moreover, for the first time, photomagnetism was investigated in frozen solution to avoid effects of intermolecular interactions. The results show that the metastable state is stabilized following the trend K > Rb > Cs. The outcome of these studies suggests that the interaction of the inserted alkali ions with the cyanide cage and the structural changes accompanying the electron transfer impact the stability of the photoinduced state and the relaxation temperature: the smaller the cation, the higher the structural reorganization and the associated energy barrier, and the more stable the metastable state.

TI Mn-based Prussian blue analogues: Multifunctional nanozymes for hydrogen
   peroxide detection and photothermal therapy of tumors
SO TALANTA
AB Nanozymes have the advantages of simple synthesis, high stability, low cost and easy recycling, and can be applied in many fields including molecular detection, disease diagnosis and cancer therapy. However, most of the current nanozymes suffer from the defects of low catalytic activity and single function, which limits their sensing sensitivity and multifunctional applications. The development of highly active and multifunctional nanozymes is an important way to realize multidisciplinary applications. In this work, Mn-based Prussian blue analogues (MnPBA) and their derived double-shelled nanoboxes (DSNBs) are synthesized by co-precipitation method. The nanobox structure of DSNBs formed by etching Mn-PBA with tannic acid endows Mn-PBA DSNBs with better peroxidase-like activity than Mn-PBA. A colorimetric method for the rapid and sensitive determination of H2O2 is developed using Mn-PBA DSNBs-1.5 as a sensor with a detection limit as low as 0.62 mu M. Moreover, Mn-PBA DSNBs-2 has excellent photothermal conversion ability, which can be applied to the photothermal therapy of tumors to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells without damaging other tissues and organs.

TI Synthesis of Mn-Prussian blue analogues with multi-enzyme activity and
   related application for alcohol detection
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Manganese-contained Prussian blue analogues (Mn-PBAs) have a rigid and open 3D framework and adjustable redox potential, coupled with nontoxic nature, they could be effectively applied in various medicinal and biomedical fields. In this study, we reported the nanozyme activity of Mn-PBA nanoparticles. It was found that Mn-PBA nanoparticles possess peroxidase (POD)-, urate oxidase (UOD)- and catalase (CAT)-like enzymes, and this multi-enzyme activity is pH-switchable. The working mechanism of Mn-PBA nanoparticles mimicking peroxidase to oxidize 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was pursued. In this process, Mn-PBA nanoparticles accelerate the decomposition of H2O2 into center dot OH, so that center dot OH catalyzes the oxidation of TMB. Based on the color reaction and the cascade reaction, we constructed a platform that utilizes Mn-PBA nanoparticles to detect alcohol concentration. This platform has a wide detection range and high detection accuracy, as well as excellent detection specificity. For example, 25 mu M-2.5 mM concentration of alcohol can be measured accurately with a good linearity overall, and the limit of detection of the alcohol concentration can reach low to 3.17 mu M. These studies prove that the application of Mn-PBA nanoparticles in biomedicine and detection has bright prospects.

TI Synthesis of Prussian Blue Analogue and Its Catalytic Activity toward
   Reduction of Environmentally Toxic Nitroaromatic Pollutants
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Nitroanilines are environmentally toxic pollutants which are released into aquatic systems due to uncontrolled industrialization. Therefore, it is crucial to convert these hazardous nitroanilines into a harmless or beneficial counterpart. In this context, we present the chemical reduction of 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) by NaBH4 utilizing Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as nanocatalyst. PBAs can serve as inexpensive, eco-friendly, and easily fabricated nanocatalysts. PBA cobalt tetracyanonickelate hexacyanochromate (CoTCNi/HCCr) was stoichiometrically prepared by a facile chemical coprecipitation. Chemical, phase, composition, and molecular interactions were investigated by XRD, EDX, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, SEM and TEM micrographs were utilized to visualize the microstructure of the nanomaterial. The findings revealed the synthesized PBA of the cubic phase and their particles in nanosheets. The band gap was estimated from the optical absorption within the UV-vis region to be 3.70 and 4.05 eV. The catalytic performance of PBA for the reduction of 4-NA was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy. The total reduction time of 4-NA by PBA was achieved within 270 s, and the computed rate constant (k) was 0.0103 s(-1). The synthesized PBA nanoparticles have the potential to be used as efficient nanocatalysts for the reduction of different hazardous nitroaromatics.

TI Prussian blue analogues of Ni-Co-MoS2 nanozymes with high peroxidase
   like activity for sensitive detection of glyphosate and copper
SO TALANTA
AB The rational development of efficient nanozymes for the colorimetric detection of targets is still challenging. Herein, Prussian blue analogues of Ni-Co-MoS2 nano boxes were fabricated for colorimetric detection of glyphosate and copper ions owing to its peroxidase like activity. At the sensing system, the Ni-Co-MoS2 nano boxes display high peroxidase activity, which could catalytically oxidize the colourless TMB to blue colour oxTMB. In presence of glyphosate in this sensing system the blue colour is diminished, ascribed to the inhibit the catalytic activity of Ni-Co-MoS2 nano boxes. Concurrently, the addition of copper ion, which result in blue colour was reappear due to the generation of glyphosate-copper complex formation. The Ni-Co-MoS2 nano boxes based colorimetric sensing platform was developed to sensitive detection of glyphosate and copper ions with low detection limit of 3 nM for glyphosate and 3.8 nM for copper. This method also displays satisfactory outcomes from real samples analysis and its good accuracy. Therefore, this work provides a great potential for rapid detection of the targets from the environments.

TI Unique bi-directional coordinative interaction of 2D inorganic nanosheet
   with Prussian blue nanocrystal for optimizing its functionality
SO NANO ENERGY
AB An interfacial electronic coupling, a crucial factor in optimizing the functionality of hybrid material, can be enhanced by unique bi-directional coordinative bonding of 2D metal oxide nanosheet with Prussian blue (PB) nanocrystal. A strong mutual interfacial bonding between monolayered 2D MnO2 nanosheet and PB nanocrystal can be achieved by remarkable coordination abilities of the surface-exposed oxide ions of MnO2 and the cyanide ligand of PB. Due to the enhanced interfacial electronic coupling, the PB-layered MnO2 nanohybrid shows excellent supercapacitor electrode performance with huge specific capacitance of 623 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1), i.e. the largest value among ever-reported PB-based electrodes, which is much superior to those of the pristine PB and PB-graphene homologue. In-situ micro-Raman analysis highlights the enhancement of the Faradaic redox process of PB lattice by strong interfacial coupling with MnO2 nanosheet. The present study underscores that the introduction of bi-directional coordinative bonding with 2D inorganic nanosheets allows to provide novel synthetic strategy to explore highly efficient energy-functional coordination-compound-based materials.

TI Porous FeNi Prussian blue cubes derived carbon-based phosphides as
   superior sulfur hosts for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB In contrast to lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries have higher theoretical energy density and lower cost, so they would become competitive in the practical application. However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and slow oxidation-reduction kinetics can degrade their electrochemical performance and cycle life. In this work, we have first developed the porous FeNi Prussian blue cubes as precursors. The calcination in different atmospheres was employed to make precursors convert into common pyrolysis products or novel carbon-based phosphides, and sulfides, labeled as FeNiP/A-C, FeNiP/A-P, and FeNiP/A-S. When these products serve as host materials in the sulfur cathode, the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries is in the order of S@FeNiP/A-P > S@FeNiP/A-S > S@FeNiP/A-C. Specifically, the initial discharge capacity of S@FeNiP/A-P can reach 679.1 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, and the capacity would maintain 594.6 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles. That is because the combination of carbon-based porous structure and numerous well-dispersed Ni2P/Fe2P active sites contribute FeNiP/A-P to obtain larger lithium-ion diffusion, lower resistance, stronger chemisorption, and more excellent catalytic effect than other samples. This work may deliver that metal-organic framework-derived carbon-based phosphides are more suitable to serve as sulfur hosts than carbon-based sulfides or common pyrolysis products for enhancing Li-S batteries' performance.

TI Designing heterostructured core@satellite Prussian Blue Analogue@Au-Ag
   nanoparticles: Effect on the magnetic properties and catalytic activity
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB We report in this article new magneto-plasmonic core@satellite Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA)@Au-Ag nanoheterostructures obtained by post-synthetic adsorption of a bimetallic [AuI2AgI2(C6F5)(4)(OEt2)(2)](n) molecular complex with ferromagnetic K+/Ni2+/[Cr(CN)(6)](3-) PBA nanoparticles. While the size, shape and structural integrity of the PBA nanoparticles are preserved upon the formation of the core@satellite heterostructures, a dramatic change in the magnetic properties is observed due to the presence of ultrasmall gold-silver nanosatellites. Moreover, the nanoarchitectures behave also as multicatalysts towards the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with enhanced activity as compared to the pristine K+/Ni2+/[Cr(CN)(6)](3-) PBA. Remarkably, these performances are found to be heightened upon light irradiation due to a plasmon-assisted catalytic effect. Such original PBA core@Au-Ag satellite architectures constitute a rare example in which an interplay between the two constituting materials leads to a reshaping of the magnetic and catalytic features.

TI Unconventional Mn Vacancies in Mn-Fe Prussian Blue Analogs: Suppressing
   Jahn-Teller Distortion for Ultrastable Sodium Storage
SO CHEM
AB Mn-Fe Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) cathode materials suffer from poor cycling reversibility and capacity retention during phase transition from cubic to tetragonal phase, which is related to the large structural deformation of Mn-N-6 octahedra caused by Jahn-Teller distortion Herein, we explore a controllable strategy for creating unconventional cation Mn vacancies (V-Mn) on the surface of Mn-Fe PBAs by utilizing a strong chelating agent-ethylenediaminet etraacetic acid disodium. The V-Mn in Mn-Fe PBAs can restrain the movement of Mn-N bonds and thereby mitigate the Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn-N(6 )octahedra, leading to highly reversible phase transitions of Mn-Fe PBAs as well as an outstanding long-term cycling stability and capacity retention for both the half-cell (72.3% after 2,700 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1)) and full cell (75.5% after 550 cycles at 0,1 A g(-1)). This work opens up a universal avenue to explore the relationship between vacancies and electrochemical performances, even in other materials beyond PBAs.

TI Multifunctional AuAg-doping Prussian Blue-based MOF: Enhanced
   colorimetric catalytic activities and amplified SERS signals for
   bacteria discrimination and detection
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB New strategy of a rapid, sensitive bacteria detection is highly desirable. Constructing a dual-mode colorimetric/ surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensor is key to obtain highly sensitive discriminating and detecting of different pathogen bacteria with high accuracy. Herein, we developed a multifunctional colorimetric catalytic nanozyme (AuAg@PB MOF) composed of AuAg-doping Prussian Blue analogue-based metal-organic framework (MOF) that fabricated by self-assembled sheet growth of Ag-etched silver-coated gold nanoparticles (Au@Ag NPs) mediated by addition of ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]). AuAg@PB MOF displays ultrahigh peroxidase-mimicking activity, enhanced colorimetric signal brightness, and notably SERS enhancement. Through optimizing its Fe-doping level, peroxidase-like activity of AuAg@PB MOF is approximately 1900-fold higher than that of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), while its 3-fold enhancement in SERS signal compared with that of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). Integrated with nanozyme-based sandwich system that made of bacteria/4MPBA (4-mercaptophenylboronic acid)/AuAg@PB MOF, this dual-modal biosensor achieves a highly sensitive colorimetric assay of bacteria with a lower limit of detection (6 CFU/mL), and simultaneously discriminate E. coli and S. aureus by bacterial "fingerprints" spectra. Furthermore, this proposed colorimetric assay was combined with a smartphone readout-sensing platform for determining bacteria with ultra-sensitivity (2 CFU/mL). This work exhibits a novel colorimetric nanozyme used in dual-mode colorimetric/SERS sensing of bacteria.

TI Controlled Self-Assembly of Hollow Core-Shell FeMn/CoNi Prussian Blue
   Analogs with Boosted Electrocatalytic Activity
SO SMALL
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are considered as efficient catalysts for energy-related applications due to their porous nanoscale architectures containing finely disseminated active sites. Their catalytic capability can be greatly boosted by the rational design and construction of complex PBA hybrid nanostructures. However, present-day structure engineering inevitably involves additional etchant or procedure. Herein, a facile, yet controllable one-pot self-assembly strategy is introduced to prepare hierarchical core-shell polymetallic PBAs (featuring bimetallic FeMn PBAs cores and CoNi PBAs shells) with hollow nano-cages/solid nano-cube architectures. The detailed characterization of material morphology/composition, assisted with theoretical simulations, reveals the underlying formation mechanism where the key factor is the control of the nucleation rate via the use of chelating agent (citrates) and reaction kinetics. The resulting FeMn@CoNi-H compound is found to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction activity with a low overpotential (236 mV at a current density 10 mA cm(-2)) as well as a low Tafel slope (58.4 mV dec(-1)). Such an impressive performance is endowed by the rational compositional and structural design with optimized electronic structures as well as an increase in exposed active sites. This work provides a robust, cost-effective pathway that enables chemical and morphological control in creating high-performance catalysts for water electrolysis.

TI 2D@3D MoS2@Ni/Co-S submicroboxes derived from prussian blue
   analogues for high performance supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Tuning the morphology and structure at micro/nanoscale has become essential for the advancement of electrode materials for supercapacitors. Here, Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) is used as precursor and template to synthesize 3D hollow submicroboxes coated with 2D MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2@Ni/Co-S) by one-pot solvothermal process. The study shows that the cubic voids in Ni-Co PBA submicrocubes become larger with the prolonging of solvothermal time owing to the etching reactions for Ni-Co PBA submicrocubes. MoS2@Ni/Co-S synthesized at 200 degrees C for 20 h possesses typical hollow structure, which is a multi-component active material composed of MoS2, CoS, NiS, Co and Ni, and exhibits high specific capacity of 109.8 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and superior rate capability with 75.4% capacity retention at 20 A g(-1), the energy density of the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor is as high as 38.5 Wh kg(-1) and the device shows excellent cycling stability of 85.4% after 5000 cycles. More importantly, this work not only offers an attractive strategy to combine Ni-Co PBA and classical solvothermal process, but also provides a new insight into the design of PBAs for advanced energy materials.

TI Prussian Blue Mg-Li Hybrid Batteries
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The major advantage of Mg batteries relies on their promise of employing an Mg metal negative electrode, which offers much higher energy density compared to graphitic carbon. However, the strong coulombic interaction of Mg2+ ions with anions leads to their sluggish diffusion in the solid state, which along with a high desolvation energy, hinders the development of positive electrode materials. To circumvent this limitation, Mg metal negative electrodes can be used in hybrid systems by coupling an Li+ insertion cathode through a dual salt electrolyte. Two "high voltage" Prussian blue analogues (average 2.3 V vs Mg/Mg2+; 3.0 V vs Li/Li+) are investigated as cathode materials and the influence of structural water is shown. Their electrochemical profiles, presenting two voltage plateaus, are explained based on the two unique Fe bonding environments. Structural water has a beneficial impact on the cell voltage. Capacities of 125 mAh g(-1) are obtained at a current density of 10 mA g(-1) (approximate to C/10), while stable performance up to 300 cycles is demonstrated at 200 mA g(-1) (approximate to 2C). The hybrid cell design is a step toward building a safe and high density energy storage system.

Fast Fourier transform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (FFT-EIS) investigation of the glass/FTO/PB/urease-based biosensor in urea-containing buffer solution indicated that the glass/FTO/PB/urease-based biosensor exhibits good sensitivity to urea (2.55 omega cm2 mM-1) and a range of linearly detectable concentrations of urea from 0.1 mM to 5.4 mM (R2 = 0.992). To determine the optimal conditions of PB layer stabilisation, the influence of acidity of NH4Cl solution on the efficiency of cyclic voltammetry-based stabilization of PB layer was investigated in this research as well.

TI Mixed Cu-Fe Sulfides Derived from Polydopamine-Coated Prussian Blue
   Analogue as a Lithium-Ion Batt ery Electrode
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Batteries employing transition-metal sulfides enable high-charge storage capacities, but polysulfide shuttling and volume expansion cause structural disintegration and early capacity fading. The design of heterostructures combining metal sulfides and carbon with an optimized morphology can effectively address these issues. Our work introduces dopamine-coated copper Prussian blue (CuPB) analogue as a template to prepare nanostructured mixed copper-iron sulfide electrodes. The material was prepared by coprecipitation of CuPB with in situ dopamine polymerization, followed by thermal sulfidation. Dopamine controls the particle size and favors K-rich CuPB due to its polymerization mechanism. While the presence of the coating prevents particle agglomeration during thermal sulfidation, its thickness demonstrates a key effect on the electrochemical performance of the derived sulfides. After a two-step activation process during cycling, the C-coated KCuFeS2 electrodes showed capacities up to 800 mAh/g at 10 mA/g with nearly 100% capacity recovery after rate handling and a capacity of 380 mAh/g at 250 mA/g after 500 cycles.

TI Prussian blue analog Co3[Co(CN)6]2 as a
   cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this work, the authors proposed a unique strategy to prepare a high performance Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) battery cathode by an N-rich nano-graphene hollow sphere from the Prussian blue analog Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2). The one-pot solution method with low cost materials was designed to synthesize the cathode by annealing with different temperatures and consistent HCl etching steps for the precursor. The Li-S batteries made by this precursor showed remarkable charge-discharge stability (570.4mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at a 1C current density) and outstanding rate performance (1145.5, 717.9, and 672.5mA hg(-1) at 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 Ag-1 current densities) at 800 degrees C. The results indicated that the stable three-dimensional multi-layer hollow sphere structure relieved the volume expansion of sulfur, which had a significant impact on the polysulfide adsorption, inhibiting the "shuttle effect." Also, the rich doping of nitrogen in this structure produced many defects and active sites that improved the interfacial adsorption of polysulfides. While Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) shows its potential as a cathode material, the material design method used in this paper provides a unique approach to realizing a high performance sulfur cathode for Li-S batteries.

TI CoFe Prussian blue analogues on 3D porous N-doped carbon nanosheets
   boost the intercalation kinetics for a high-performance
   quasi-solid-state hybrid capacitor
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), especially those with crystal water networks, have attracted extensive attention for aqueous electrolyte-based energy storage devices. Herein, we report CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe PBA) nanoparticles grown on interconnected porous nitrogen-doped carbon (IPNC) as an electrode material for a high-performance hybrid capacitor. The CoFe PBA/IPNC hybrid exhibits a high specific capacity of 93.1 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) with excellent cycling stability (retention of 91.5%) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The hierarchical porous carbon support provides sufficient ion diffusion channels, and the numerous electroactive interfaces between CoFe PBA and IPNC enhance reaction kinetics for intercalation charge storage. Theoretical calculations verify the significant influence of the interface interaction between CoFe PBA and IPNC for enhanced electrochemical kinetics. A quasi-solid-state hybrid capacitor assembled using CoFe PBA/IPNC, IPNC, and Na2SO4-PAM gel as the positive electrode, negative electrode, and electrolyte shows high energy density up to 42.9 W h kg(-1) and power density up to 14.6 kW kg(-1). The flexible device successfully operates an LED paper-watch, demonstrating the potential for practical application.

TI A Trinity Strategy to Boost the Catalytic Efficiency of Prussian Blue
   Nanozyme for Paper-Based Glucose Sensing Devices
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB The use of artificial enzymes in paper-based sensors is a cost-effective approach for point-of-care testing, yet the limited catalytic activity of nanozymes restricts their biosensing applications. Herein, we employed a trinity strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of Prussian blue nanozymes (PBNZs). The extraneous generation of hydroxyl radicals by cesium-doped PBNZs (CsPB) was confirmed via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Cs+ in the buffer was proved to accelerate the electron transfer. Additionally, CsPB exhibited superior photothermal performance due to improved crystallinity, facilitating the promotion of POD-like activity. Based on this strategy, a paper-based device for rapid glucose sensing (PB-PD) was developed, demonstrating a linear response for glucose concentrations from 0.05 to 20 mM (r(2) > 0.995) with a limit of detection of 33.6 mu M, good reproducibility, and excellent storage stability. The PB-PD showed consistent results comparable to commercial strips, indicating strong potential for clinical applications.

TI A Mn-Fe based Prussian blue Analogue@Reduced graphene oxide composite as
   high capacity and superior rate capability anode for lithium-ion
   batteries
SO CARBON
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted increasing attention in energy research due to their open frameworks and short channels. However, the practical application of PBAs as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is severely limited by their low capacity and poor cycling performance. In this work, a Mn-Fe based Prussian blue analogue@reduced graphene oxide (Mn-PBA@rGO) composite is prepared via an in-situ synthesis process to maximum using the residual manganese ions in the GO suspension. The Mn-PBA nanoparticles (NPs) anchor tightly on the rGO layers that form a conductive network in the composite. The forceful synergistic effect between the highly conductive N-doped rGO layers and Mn-PBA NPs can efficaciously mitigate the structural collapse and aggregation during the insertion and extraction of Li+. Because of above merits, the Mn-PBA@rGO composite exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1167.7 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1) and superior rate capability, delivering capacities of 844.0, 594.5, and 400.1 mAh g(-1) at 3, 5, and 10 A g(-1), respectively. The specific capacities at 3, 5 and 10 A g(-1) can be equal to the initial one even after 1000 cycles, thus indicating that it is a promising anode material for LIBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Towards the Extraction of Radioactive Cesium-137 from Water via
   Graphene/CNT and Nanostructured Prussian Blue Hybrid Nanocomposites: A
   Review
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Cesium is a radioactive fission product generated in nuclear power plants and is disposed of as liquid waste. The recent catastrophe at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan has increased the Cs-137 and Cs-134 concentrations in air, soil and water to lethal levels. Cs-137 has a half-life of 30.4 years, while the half-life of Cs-134 is around two years, therefore the formers' detrimental effects linger for a longer period. In addition, cesium is easily transported through water bodies making water contamination an urgent issue to address. Presently, efficient water remediation methods towards the extraction of Cs-137 are being studied. Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs have shown very high efficiencies in the capture of Cs-137(+) ions. In addition, combining them with magnetic nanoparticles such as Fe3O4 allows their recovery via magnetic extraction once exhausted. Graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNT) are the new generation carbon allotropes that possess high specific surface areas. Moreover, the possibility to functionalize them with organic or inorganic materials opens new avenues in water treatment. The combination of PB-CNT/Graphene has shown enhanced Cs-137(+) extraction and their possible applications as membranes can be envisaged. This review will survey these nanocomposites, their efficiency in Cs-137(+) extraction, their possible toxicity, and prospects in large-scale water remediation and succinctly survey other new developments in Cs-137(+) extraction.

TI Determination of deoxynivalenol (DON) by a label-free electrochemical
   immunosensor based on Ni-Fe PBA nanozymes
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination in food products significantly threatens human health, necessitating a reliable and sensitive detection method. This study aims to develop a simple, low-cost, and effective electrochemical immunoassay method for detecting DON based on the nickel-iron bimetallic Prussian blue analog (Ni-Fe PBA). The Ni-Fe PBA nanozymes with high peroxidase-like activity were synthesized using an environmentally friendly chemical precipitation method. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the current change of thionine oxidation initiated by Ni-Fe PBA nanozymes can be exploited to diagnose DON. Under optimal conditions, the proposed method achieved quantitative detection of DON in the range of 10-107 pg mL(- 1) with a detection limit of 4.5 pg mL-( 1) (S/N = 3), demonstrating excellent selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. In addition, the DON immunosensor provides satisfactory results for the detection in real samples, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed sensor in detecting of DON in such products.

TI Modulating the hydration number of calcium ions by varying the
   electrolyte concentration: Electrochemical performance in a Prussian
   blue electrode/aqueous electrolyte system for calcium-ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB We report on the effects of the changed hydration number of calcium ions due to the variation in the electrolyte concentration in a Prussian blue analogue electrode, CuHCF, and aqueous electrolyte system on its performance, for calcium-ion batteries (CIBs). As determined by Raman spectroscopy, the coordination number of the calcium ions, that is, the number of nitrate anions surrounding it in the aqueous electrolyte gradually increased upon increasing the electrolyte concentration from 1.0 to 8.4 mol dm(-3). In other words, the hydration number of calcium ions gradually decreased. Additionally, the activation energy, Ea, for the interfacial charge transfer during the process of calcium ion insertion into the CuHCF electrode was estimated from the temperature dependence of the charge transfer resistance in these aqueous electrolytes via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Ea value gradually decreased with increasing electrolyte concentration. These results are directly related to the electrochemical performance such as the discharge/charge capacities, rate capability, and cyclability in this system for CIBs. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI X-ray spectroscopic analysis of stochastic, periodic precipitation in
   Co-Fe-Based Prussian blue analogues
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY
AB Inorganic precipitates sometimes spontaneously create complex, interesting banding structures in gels, which are potentially applicable in materials engineering. A new member of such self-organizing bandings, i.e ., stochastic, periodic banding of the precipitates of Co-Fe-based Prussian blue analogues (Co-Fe PBAs), denoted as "pattern-A", was observed in water-glass gels. The pattern-A periodic bands did not obey empirical scaling laws that many Liesegang bands follow, illustrating the importance of ripening effects. Time-resolved X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and position-dependent X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements were conducted for a pattern-A sample, which was prepared from 0.30 M CoCl2 and 0.05 M K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] solutions. XRF results demonstrated that the Co-Fe PBA distributions fluctuated highly over the sample tube, including the turbid zone, and suggested that significant Ostwald ripening of the Co-Fe PBAs takes place in the periodic bands. XANES results indicated that the local structures and symmetries of the Co-Fe PBAs in the periodic bands were highly uniform. Furthermore these results are consistent with a model where the periodic bands contain a relatively high concentration of Co-Fe PBAs, with the most dominant local structure being Co(OC)(4)(NCFe)(2), co-existing with [Co(H2O)(6)](2)+ ions. These findings not only provide an interesting piece of information for future self-organization processes of Co-Fe PBAs, but also confirm the potential of the combined X-ray spectroscopic techniques for in-depth analysis of the periodic precipitation phenomenon in gels.

TI Highly crystalline Prussian blue cubes filled with tin oxide as anode
   materials for lithium-ion batteries
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue (PB), which is typically used as a cathode for sodium-ion batteries, has seldomly been studied as anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this study, a one-step hydrothermal method has been used to prepare hierarchical highly crystalline 3D PB cubic structure anode material, which were subsequently filled with tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles. The effective growth mechanism and improvement in the surface structure of iron ferricyanide and bare PB are compared with previously reported PB-based nanocomposite materials. The specific capacity of the PB@SnO2 material was higher than that of PB and structural stability was achieved after 300 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). Furthermore, the unique structure of PB@SnO2 was studied, and the effect of the structure on the electrochemical performance of PB@SnO2 as an LIB anode was evaluated. The proposed electrode presented significantly improved the stability enhanced the active sites, and delivered a high specific capacity of -910 mAh/g. The N atoms of the ammonium salt used to fabricate PB yielded N-doped carbon, which served as a cushion, effectively preventing particle aggregation and volume expansion of PB@SnO2 during cycling.

TI Iron-based Prussian blue coupled with polydopamine film for advanced
   sodium-ion batteries
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB In this study, high-performance polydopamine (PDA) coated Na1.33FeFe(CN)6.1.16H2O (PBA) cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are successfully synthesized by using a single source method with Na4Fe(CN)6 as sole iron source. The PDA coating does not alter the structure or morphology of the PBA sample, but greatly improves its conductivity and Na ion diffusion ability because of the good conductivity. Consequently, we observe enhanced reversible capacity, rate capability and cycle stability during cycling. Our results indicate that PBA-2 has the best electrochemical performance and sodium ion diffusion coefficient among all samples. Even at 1 C rate, PBA-2 has a high initial discharge capacity of 145 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention of 90% over 100 cycles. The introduction of a suitable amount of PDA represents an effective strategy for enhancing the electrochemical activity of PBA for advanced SIBs. Such design strategies can be also used to modify other cathode materials for SIBs.

TI Prussian-blue-analogue derived FeNi2S4/NiS nanoframes supported by
   N-doped graphene for highly efficient methanol oxidation
   electrocatalysis
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The design of effective and robust non-noble metal electrocatalysts to enhance catalytic reaction kinetic is critical to promote methanol oxidation catalysis. Herein, hierarchical Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived sulfide heterostructures supported by N-doped graphene (FeNi2S4/NiS-NG) as efficient catalysts have been developed for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Benefiting from the merits of hollow nanoframes structure and heteroge-neous sulfide synergy, FeNi2S4/NiS-NG composite not only possesses abundant active sites to boost the catalytic properties but also alleviates the CO poisoning effect during the process exhibiting favorable kinetic behavior toward MOR. Specifically, the remarkable catalytic activity (97.6 mA cm-2/1544.3 mA mg-1) of FeNi2S4/NiS-NG for methanol oxidation was achieved, superior to most reported non-noble electrocatalysts. Additionally, the catalyst showed competitive electrocatalytic stability, with a current density of over 90% after 2000 consecutive CV cycles. This study offers promising insights into the rational modulation of the morphology and components of precious-metal-free catalysts for fuel cell applications.

TI Zinc-modulated Fe-Co Prussian blue analogues with well-controlled
   morphologies for the efficient sorption of cesium
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with tunable compositions and morphologies have demonstrated great potential in many applications. We successfully synthesized a series of KFexZn1-x[Co(CN)6] (FexZn1-x-Co) PBAs with well-controlled compositions and morphologies and used them as adsorbents for the removal of Cs+ ions. The increase of Zn : Fe ratio had a significant influence on the final morphology and improved the sorption capacity for Cs. X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure spectra were used to confirm that the Cs+ ions were inserted into the crystal channels rather than simply adsorbed on the surface of the PBAs. Based on the quantitative correlation between the concentration of ions released from the PBAs and the Cs+ ions adsorbed, the mechanism of Cs+ sorption in the FexZn1-x-Co PBAs was studied and a Zn2+-modulated Cs+ sorption model, which illustrated the difference in sorption behavior between the FexZn1-x-Co PBAs, was proposed and confirmed by FTIR spectra, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectra. The results indicated that the FexZn1-x-Co PBAs are excellent candidates for the removal of radioactive Cs-137 from nuclear waste.

TI Investigations of Nanoparticle Suspensions of Prussian Blue and Its
   Copper Analogue: Amine Functionalization and Electrochemical Studies
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues are promising materials for electrochemical energy storage, yet their use in flow-type devices is limited by their lack of redox responsiveness as colloidal suspensions. We have investigated the redox chemistry amine functionalization of PB along with its Cu analogue (CuPBA). No redox response of colloidal PB was observed and suspensions of CuPBA formed films on electrode surfaces with and without applied potentials; the films were redox-active but the material that remained suspended in solution did not participate in redox chemistry. Propylamine (pa), ethylenediamine (en), or tetramethylethylenedi-amine (TMEDA) were added in an attempt to maintain well dispersed suspensions through nanoparticle surface functionalization. Propyl-amine modifications resulted in a loss of the CuPBA network and subsequent precipitation of insoluble materials. Coordination of ethylenediamine prompted the formation of Cu and Fe monomers ([Cu(en)2]m+/[Fe(CN)6]n-]) that remained soluble in aqueous electrolytes. In the absence of supporting electrolytes, these monomers formed a one-dimensional (1D) polymeric structure (Cu2Fe-1D). TMEDA modification preserved the CuPBA extended structure with only modest precipitate formation over 30 min. The redox responsiveness of these suspensions depended on conditions; in 1 M KCl, no redox chemistry was observed for the CuPBA. In pH 4 potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer, a signal was observed that was attributed to the Fe centers of CuPBA. Under these conditions, the material precipitated in similar to 15 min and the signal was lost. Although the Fe centers in these networks are redox-active, additional work is needed to realize longer-term redox activity and stability. Ligand modifications can alter the properties of these networks but within a given ligand class, e.g., amines, the effects can vary greatly from the deconstruction of the framework to preventing film formation.

TI Exceptionally high and reversible NOx uptake by hollow
   Mn-Fe composite nanocubes derived from Prussian blue analogues
SO NANOSCALE
AB Noble metal-based catalysts are widely used as passive NOx adsorbers (PNA) for cold-start NOx emissions; however, efficient porous materials as an alternative have great development potential. Herein, porous Mn-Fe composites with hollow nanocubes derived from Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursors were used as PNA. The effects of O-2, the molar ratio of Mn/Fe, calcination temperature and reaction temperature on their adsorption capacity were explored. The physicochemical properties of the obtained catalysts were systematically characterized by XRD, SEM, BET surface area, TGA, XPS and DRIFT techniques. The developed Mn1Fe2-450 presented excellent NOx uptake (more than 2.16 mmol g(-1) at 200 degrees C). Moreover, a high NOx adsorption performance was also retained in the presence of 10% water vapor. The existing Mn3+ and Fe2+ species could contribute to the NOx adsorption and gaseous O-2 can accelerate NO activation to form more easily adsorbed NO2. Surface NO2 is further diffused and stored into the bulk of the Mn-Fe composite in the form of nitrite and nitrate. This work revealed a novel candidate for PNA catalysts, which might provide inspiration for the design of new adsorbent materials.

TI Prussian blue analogues derived from NiFe-hydroxide nanoplates with
   synergistic effect and as high performance supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The electrochemical performance of nickel hydroxide is limited by its poor electron transfer ability and limited ion transport channels, while Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have the advantages of high specific surface area and high porosity, which can provide more transport channels for electron transfer. Therefore, Fe-Ni(OH)2/PBAs heterogeneous structures electrode materials with good electrochemical properties were obtained by etching nickel foam with trivalent iron ions and then partially converting to PBAs in situ. Due to the synergistic interaction between Fe-Ni(OH)2 and PBAs, the heterogeneous structures is 3324.1 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, which is much higher than that of Fe-Ni(OH)2 (only 1494.9 F g-1). In addition, the hybrid asym-metric button-type supercapacitor with Fe-Ni(OH)2/PBAs heterogeneous structures as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode has a specific capacitance of 851.1 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, an energy density power density of 231.7 W h kg-1 at 699.9 W kg-1, the cycling stability performance can reach 100.2% at 10 A g-1 after 6000 cycles. This research evidence a solution for the study of supercapacitor electrodes by constructing heterogeneous structures of high-performance electrode materials from the idea of synergistic effects. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Out-of-equilibrium lattice response to photo-induced charge-transfer in
   a MnFe Prussian blue analogue
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Photo-induced structural dynamics in molecular materials often involve two main components; local molecular distortions induced by the self-trapping of electronic excited state and incoherent lattice dynamics due to energy dissipation. The latter component frequently hinders clear manifestation at macroscopic scale of local self-trapped entities and their coupling to the lattice. The studied photoactive MnFe Prussian blue analogue exhibits no thermal expansion, which allows observing long-range lattice dynamics induced by the structural trapping of photo-induced charge-transfer (CT) states. The self-trapping of the photo-induced (MnFeII)-Fe-III -> (MnFeIII)-Fe-II is responsible for the emergence of various physical properties. At equilibrium, the lattice volume expansion and the ferroelastic Jahn-Teller distortion associated with the charge-transfer-based phase transition, evolve in a coupled way. Here, we use time resolved X-ray diffraction to investigate the anisotropic out-of-equilibrium lattice dynamics triggered by the self-trapping of photo-induced (MnFeII)-Fe-III -> (MnFeIII)-Fe-II CT. The observed dynamics evidence a decoupling of both types of lattice deformations in the time domain, with an impulsive lattice response driven by the local Jahn-Teller reorganization and a displacive volume expansion controlled by the long-lived photo-induced CT small-polarons, due to the population of antibonding orbitals centered on Mn-N bonds in the (a,b) lattice plane.

TI In situ growth of Prussian blue analogue-derived Fe-doped NiS on
   Ni(OH)2 for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The energy industry is placing more and more emphasis on the need for effective and affordable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). In this work, an iron-doped NiS/Ni(OH)(2)/CC composite material was synthesized by simple hydrothermal sulfurization processes of bimetallic Prussian blue analogue (PBAs) precursors grown in situ on three-dimensional (3D) Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. The overpotential can be 103 mV to attain current densities of 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent catalytic activity of Fe-NiS/Ni(OH)(2)/CC is because of the unique 3D structure and the uniform doping of iron caused by the in situ growth of PBA, as well as the high conductivity of the self-supported electrode carbon cloth.

TI Photoenhanced Ferromagnetism in High-K<SUP>+</SUP>-Containing K-Ni-Cr
   Prussian Blue Analogues Coated on Rb-Co-Fe Nanocubes
SO ACS OMEGA
AB A large enhancement of the Ni and Cr ferromagnetic moments under UV-light irradiation has been detected in 55 nm thick K0.98Ni[Cr(CN)(6)] (0.70)[(H2O)(6)] (0.30) . 0.11H(2)O Prussian blue analogues coated on 240 nm Rb0.76Co[Fe(CN) (6)] 0.74[(H2O) (6)] (0.26) .0.56H(2)O nanocubes. Two separate magnetic transitions were found. The one at 72 K marks the magnetic ordering of the Ni and Cr ions on the shell. A higher degree of electronic connection along the NiN-C-Cr-C-N-Ni chains was achieved by the incorporation of a larger amount of K+ ions into the voids enclosed by the NiN6 and CrC6 octahedra, which was used to understand the appearance of photoenhanced ferromagnetism in the KNi-Cr network. A weak moment developed in the core below 10 K, corresponding to separate ordering of the Co and Fe ions in the Rb-Co-Fe network. Photoinduced ferromagnetism of the Co and Fe ions in the Rb-Co-Fe was also detected.

TI Low-Spin Fe Redox-Based Prussian Blue with excellent selective dual-band
   electrochromic modulation and energy-saving applications
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Dual-band electrochromic materials (DBEMs) are of utmost importance for smart windows to realize independent control of the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) light. However, very few single -component DBEMs are capable of independently and effectively controlling both VIS and NIR light. Here, we present Prussian blue (PB) with remarkable performance to replace the composite DBEMs that require deliberate design and complicated preparation. Excellent durability and capacity were achieved simultaneously due to the activated low-spin Fe in PB. A dual-band electrochromic device (DBED) by using PB thin films as electrochromic layers was constructed, exhibiting superior dual-band elec-trochromic performance, energy storage performance and memory effect. We show that the energy -saving DBED can be bleached without applying any external bias potential, and can be colored by using a commercial photovoltaic solar panel under ambient solar irradiation. The stored energy during col-oration can be further used to light up the lights. Finally, the coloration mechanism of the DBED was stud-ied by the density functional theory calculations, to shed light on the large optical transmittance modulation in both VIS and NIR regions. The new insights will advance the design of efficient and durable DBEMs and the development of bi-functional smart windows. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Modulation of reaction pathway of Prussian blue analogues derived Zn-Fe
   double oxides towards organic pollutants oxidation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The radical-based Fenton-like reaction quenching by various inorganic anions or high concentration of organic matters restrict the practical value in future industrial application. Contrarily, the nonradical-dominated system could efficiently overcome above limitations and achieve excellent catalytic capacity under a wide category of water matrixes. Herein, a series of Zn-Fe double oxides were successfully fabricated via calcination of Zn1-xFex-Fe Prussian blue analogues under ambient atmosphere. Under the coexistence of visible light and perox-ymonosulfate (PMS), Zn-Fe double oxides manifested excellent catalytic performance towards various organic pollutants oxidation with trace amount of iron leaching, and even showed superior contaminant decomposition efficiency under high concentration of organic matter and practical aqueous system. Confirmed by radical trapping experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the photo-induced electrons and holes can act as triggers to PMS activation and thereby transform reaction routes from radicals to singlet oxygen (1O2) -dominated nonradical pathway over the prepared Zn-Fe double oxides. This work provided new insights and comprehension into modulating radical and nonradical pathways of PMS-based advanced oxidation process for refractory contaminant oxidation via utilizing solar energy.

TI Ultrastrong-polar cyano-Prussian blue analogs hybrid tribomaterials for
   biomechanical energy harvesting and self-powered sensing
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are green energy devices that can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. However, lower output power density currently hinders its realistic applications. Introducing functional materials into dielectric polymers layer is an efficient approach to enhance TENG output. Herein, a low-cost, biocompatible Prussian blue analog (KxMn[FeCN)(6)](y)center dot zH(2)O, MnFePBA) is proposed as a functional component for high-performance hybrid tribomaterials of TENGs. Numerous highly polar C  N groups found in MnFePBA can interact dipole-dipole with the C-F bond in PVDF, promoting the formation of electroactive beta-phase PVDF and enhancing the capacity for charge induction and charge capture. Simultaneously, the weak interface fusion between the inorganic material and the organic polymer can be improved as the O-H bond in MnFePBA can establish a stronger hydrogen bond with the C-F bond in PVDF. Additionally, high dielectric MnFePBA can enhance the dielectric properties of PVDF/MnFePBA to boost the TENG output. Consequently, the PVDF/MnFePBA can achieve evidently increased short-circuit current of 31.2 mu A, output voltage of 1580 V and ultra-high power density of 12.8 W/m(2) (4 x4 cm(2)). Moreover, the assembled TENG could also be efficiently utilized for human motion capture and sensing applications. This work enriches the range of functional components for high-performance tribomaterials of TENGs.

TI Electrochemical Sensing and Removal of Cesium from Water Using Prussian
   Blue Nanoparticle-Modified Screen-Printed Electrodes
SO CHEMOSENSORS
AB Selective screening followed by the sensing of cesium radionuclides from contaminated water is a challenging technical issue. In this study, the adsorption functionality of Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles was utilized for the detection and efficient removal of cesium cations. An efficient PB nanoparticle-modified screen-printed electrode (SPE) in the three-electrode configuration was developed for the electrochemical sensing and removal of Cs+. PB nanoparticles inks were obtained using a facile two-step process that was previously described as suitable for dispensing over freshly prepared screen-printed electrodes. The PB nanoparticle-modified SPE induced a cesium adsorption-dependent chronoamperometric signal based on ion exchange as a function of cesium concentration. This ion exchange, which is reversible and rapid, is associated with electron transfer in the PB nanoparticle-modified SPE. Using this electrochemical adsorption system (EAS) based on chronoamperometry, the maximum adsorption capacity (Q(max)) of Cs+ ions in the PB nanoparticle-modified SPE reached up to 325 +/- 1 mg.g(-1) in a 50 +/- 0.5 mu M Cs+ solution, with a distribution coefficient (K-d) of 580 +/- 5 L.g(-1) for Cs+ removal. The cesium concentration-dependent adsorption of PB nanoparticles was also demonstrated by fluorescence spectroscopy based on fluorescence quenching of PB nanoparticles as a function of cesium concentration using a standard fluorophore like fluorescein in a manner analogous to that previously reported for As(III).

AB In this work we present the outstanding energy storage of prepared inorganic-organic heterojunction where hydrogenated ordered titania nanotubes (H-TiO2NT) were modified by the hybrid made of poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene) (pEDOT) and iron hexacyanoferrate centres (Fehcf, Prussian Blue). The material TiO2NT/pEDOT:Fechf was obtained electrochemically by means of: anodization, hydrogenation and finally, electropolymerization Of EDOT in the presence of Fe(CN)V/4- ions. Inorganic-organic hybrids were characterized using Raman spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The morphology of Obtained materials was inspected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrodes were tested using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles in an aqueous electrolyte. The characterization of capacitance was studied by means of multiple (up to 10,000) charge/discharge cycles with the current density of 0.45 mA cm(-2). Electrode materials consisting of H-TiO2, pEDOT and Prussian Blue exhibited the highest capacitance of 26 mF cm(-2) even after 10,000 cycles. Thus, the capacitance of TiO2NT/pEDOT:Fehcf was ca. 15 and 8 times higher than the capacitance registered for pure and hydrogenated TiO2, respectively. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Another method to calculate grain size distribution parameters: Using
   Ising model and particle swarm optimization algorithm
SO SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The grain size distribution parameters and magnetic parameters(exchange constant J and anisotropy parameter K) of CoFe Prussian blue analogues has been calculated using Ising model and particle swarm optimization algorithm in this work. The lattice with free boundary conditions is constructed to simulate the magnetism of Prussian blue analogues. The temperature dependence of magnetization varies with lattice size. Due to the fact that the grain size of the actual system follows lognormal distribution, we use the particle swarm optimization algorithm to search the two parameters of the lognormal distribution Sigma and (D- )and the Co-Fe exchange coupling constant J and the anisotropy parameters K of the system. The results show that the grain size is similar to 17.8 nm calculated by this method, which is close to the result (186 A) calculated by Debye Scherrer formula. This method can be used to calculate the grain size of magnetic systems more accurately and can be applied to most small grain systems. Once the grain size distribution has been determined, it is also possible to deduce the magnetic parameters (exchange constant J and anisotropy parameter K).

TI Boosting electrocatalytic oxygen evolution over Prussian blue
   analog/transition metal dichalcogenide nanoboxes by photo-induced
   electron transfer
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Solar-assisted electrocatalytic water oxidation holds great promise in modern energy conversion and storage devices. Herein, we present the design and construction of an advanced class of Prussian blue analog (PBA)/transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) hybrids, which combine the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of TMDs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the sunlight response of TMDs and PBAs. Consequently, the porous framework, engineered surface defects, and abundant oxygen vacancies endow them with remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward OER due to the enlarged electrolyte-accessible surface, high structural integrity, and abundant electron and mass transfer routes. Moreover, they could also enable photo-assisted oxidation reactions with significantly high current density and low overpotential. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the OER improvement can mainly be ascribed to the combination of photo-driven and electricity-driven water oxidation reaction, where the photogenerated electron transfer from PBAs to TMDs results in photogenerated holes in PBAs that are more beneficial for the oxidation of H2O, as well as affording decreased activation energy of TMDs for the OER. This work manifests the photo-assisted electrocatalytic water oxidation ability of PBA/TMD hybrids and offers a new avenue for the design and construction of high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting upon light irradiation.

TI Fabrication of ordered macro-mesoporous single-crystalline Prussian blue
   and their derivatives for rechargeable sodium ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Benefiting from their improved accessibility of active sites and accelerated ion diffusion processes, ordered macro-mesoporous materials have received substantial attention in energy storage fields. However, preparing ordered hierarchical porous materials with single-crystal nature remains a huge challenge. Herein, we successfully prepare ordered macro-mesoporous single-crystalline Fe-based Prussian blue (denoted as OMMS-Fe-HCF) by chelating-agent-assisted in-situ crystallization strategy within a three-dimensional (3D) ordered polystyrene spheres (PS) template interstice. Subsequently, 3D ordered macroporous iron diselenide@carbon hybrid tetradecahedron (denoted as 3DOM-FeSe2@C) is favorably prepared by in-situ selenization of the OMMS-Fe-HCF template. The resulting composite can commendably inherit and reserve the macroporous architecture and cubo-octahedron morphology of the precursor. In particular, FeSe2 nanoparticles are homogeneously encapsulated into the macroporous carbon matrix, significantly improving the mass transfer performance while maintaining the structural integrity. By virtue of hierarchical structure advantages and excellent conductivity, the 3DOM-FeSe2@C exhibits high-rate capability (361.6 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1) and excellent cycling durability (306.4 mAh g-1 after 900 cycles at 2 A g-1) for sodium-ion batteries. Considering the rational design and accurate construction of OMMS-Fe-HCF, our work provides a new perspective on the preparation of such highly ordered macro-mesoporous composite for application in the energy storage fields.

TI CoNi hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanotubes as
   superior cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted growing interest as competitive cathode materials for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). However, their low conductivity and easy structural collapse often lead to poor reversible capacity and cyclability. Herein, cobalt-nickel hexacyanoferrate (CoNiHCF), a CoNi-Prussian blue analogue, are designed as AZIBs cathode materials for the first time, in which highly uniform CoNiHCF nanocubes are in-situ decorated on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via a simple co-precipitation method. The resulted CoNiHCF/CNTs composite displays superior zinc ion storage performance, with a great reversible capacity of 124.9 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 50 mA g(-1), and a high capacity retention of 81.8 % at 3000 mA g(-1) for 1000 cycles, which are remarkably superior to those of CoHCF, NiHCF and CoNiHCF. The excellent Zn2+ storage properties of CoNiHCF/CNTs can be ascribed to the bimetallic synergistic effect of Co and Ni as well as the introduction of conductive CNTs skeleton. This study offers a straightforward and efficient method for promoting the application of PBAs-based cathodes in AZIBs.

TI Copper Prussian Blue Nanoparticles with Varying Amounts of
   [Fe(CN)6] Defects as Supercapacitor Materials
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Construction of the defect structure is a significant approach to optimize the electronic structure and promote the reaction kinetics. However, excessive defects will destroy the structure stability and further inhibit the performance of the electrode material. Herein, a series of copper Prussian blue (CuFe-PBA) nanomaterials with different contents of [Fe(CN)(6)] defects are synthesized by a simple chemical coprecipitation method using sodium citrate as a chelating agent and adjusting its ratio with copper ion. The effect of defect regulation on the crystal structure and the difference in the electrochemical properties of CuFe-PBA nanoparticles with different defect contents are studied. The experimental results indicate that reducing the defect content can significantly enhance the energy storage performances of PBAs. CuFe-PBA-2 has the maximum lattice parameters in all samples, ensuring rapid ion migration and electrochemical reaction kinetics, achieving a high specific capacitance of 220 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and a superior rate capability with 86.4% of the initial specific capacity at 10 A g(-1). Furthermore, the minimum [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies increase the load-bearing capacity while guaranteeing the framework's flexibility, thereby enhancing structural stability and ensuring that CuFe-PBA-2 can provide an ultralong cycle life of 107.4% in 10,000 cycles. The hybrid device (CuFe-PBA-2//CNT) receives an energy density of 7.1 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 1.0 kW kg(-1) and an energy density of 5.6 Wh kg(-1) at a high power density of 7.0 kW kg(-1). This work offers a method for regulating defects in CuFe-PBA nanoparticles and provides insight into the relationship between defects and electrochemical performances.

SO CHEMIE INGENIEUR TECHNIK
AB Industrial implementation of the heterogeneously catalyzed CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols is highly desired, but deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and active sites are still needed. This review summarizes the established and well-investigated cobalt-based catalysts and the mechanisms resulting in oxygenate formation. Recently, a cobalt-based system derived from Mn-Co-based Prussian blue analogs by pyrolysis has shown great potential for higher-alcohol synthesis. In addition to the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction pathways involved in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis, the homogeneously catalyzed reaction pathways like reductive olefin hydroformylation and reductive primary alcohol carbonylation were found to play a key role.
   Industrial-scale higher-alcohol synthesis (HAS) is highly desired, but deeper insights into reaction mechanisms and active sites are still needed. This review summarizes well-explored Co-based systems, focusing on a new class of HAS catalysts based on Prussian blue analogs with Co2C/Co0 and Co-N-C active sites, linking heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. image

TI Prussian Blue Analogue Derived CoS2/FeS2 Confined
   in N, S Dual-Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Sodium Storage
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Pyrite iron disulfide (FeS2) has aroused wide attention owing to its high theoretical capacity, making it a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Unfortunately, the poor electrical conductivity, large volume variation, and sluggish ion-migration kinetics lead to inferior rate capability and cycle stability, thus limiting its practical application. Herein, utilizing Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as precursors, hollow heterostructured CoS2/FeS2 nanoparticles confined in N, S dual-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as H-CoS2/FeS2@CNFs) are successfully developed via facile electrospinning, carbonization, and gas sulfurization processes. The effective combination of a unique hollow heterostructure and highly conductive N, S dual-doped CNFs can accelerate electron transport and ion diffusion kinetics, avoid aggregation of active materials, and obtain enhanced structural stability. As expected, the optimal H-CoS2/FeS2@CNFs-2 hybrid composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 542.6 mA h g(-1 )after 150 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1) and outstanding cycling stability with a capacity of 323.7 mA h g(-1) over 1500 cycles at 5.0 A g(-1), showing the excellent sodium storage capability for SIBs. The rational design offers inspiration for fabricating high-performance bimetallic sulfides as anodes of SIBs through spatial confinement and a heterogeneous interface engineering strategy.

TI Copper Hexacyanoferrate Thin Film Deposition and Its Application to a
   New Method for Diffusion Coefficient Measurement
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The use of Prussian blue analogues (PBA) materials in electrochemical energy storage and harvesting has gained much interest, necessitating the further clarification of their electrochemical characteristics. However, there is no well-defined technique for manufacturing PBA-based microelectrochemical devices because the PBA film deposition method has not been well studied. In this study, we developed the following deposition method for growing copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCFe) thin film: copper thin film is immersed into a potassium hexacyanoferrate solution, following which the redox reaction induces the spontaneous deposition of CuHCFe thin film on the copper thin film. The film grown via this method showed compatibility with conventional photolithography processes, and the micropattern of the CuHCFe thin film was successfully defined by a lift-off process. A microelectrochemical device based on the CuHCFe thin film was fabricated via micropatterning, and the sodium ion diffusivity in CuHCFe was measured. The presented thin film deposition method can deposit PBAs on any surface, including insulating substrates, and it can extend the utilization of PBA thin films to various applications.

TI Prussian blue analogues-derived bimetallic phosphide hollow nanocubes
   grown on Ni foam as water splitting electrocatalyst
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The development of highly active and stable electrocatalysts for the water splitting using the earth-abundant transition metal as precursor is important for the renewable energy application. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are regarded as an ideal precursor for the preparation of electrocatalysts because of its abundant metal elements and various derived porous nanostructures. In this work, the (NiCo)(2)P hollow nanocubes, which are firmly grown on Ni foam, are prepared by PBAs and used as an water splitting electrocatalyst with high activity and stability in 1 M KOH solution. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of nickel and cobalt, hollow structure and high double-layer capacitance, the as-synthesized (NiCo)(2)P/NF catalyst shows an excellent electrocatalytic performance for the water splitting. To achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2), for HER and OER, this material requires overpotentials of 162 mV and 220 mV, respectively. As an integrated electrocatalyst for water splitting, the (NiCo)(2)P/NF needs a cell voltage of 1.62 V to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, this material has long-term electrocatalytic stability (over 30 h). The high catalytic activity of this material is attributed to the synergistic effect of component and the hollow structure of catalyst. This facile and novel method of preparing bimetallic phosphide electrocatalysts with hollow structure provides a broadened space for the design and synthesis of non-noble metal catalysts in the future.

TI Percolating Network of Anionic Vacancies in Prussian Blue: Origin of
   Superior Ammonium-Ion Storage Performance
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Emerging aqueous ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs) are considered inexpensive, highly safe, ecofriendly, and sustainable energy storage systems. Although some high-performance electrode materials have been reported for AIBs, a comprehensive understanding of the origin of the high ammonium-ion storage performance is still lacking. Herein, the percolating network of anionic vacancies is determined to be the origin of the superior ammonium-ion storage properties of the Prussian blue analogues based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and electrochemical kinetic analyses. Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] with a percolating anionic vacancy network delivers an outstanding rate of 64.7 mAh g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1) in addition to a capacity retention of 94.5% after 10 000 cycles. The low-strain intercalation ammonium-ion storage mechanism of highly deficient Fe Prussian blue with Fe as the redox center is revealed by in situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. The results provide insights into the mechanism of ammonium-ion storage in Prussian blue analogues and guidance in the development of aqueous AIBs.

TI Electrostatic interactions and physisorption: mechanisms of passive
   cesium adsorption on Prussian blue
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The dangers posed by nuclear accidents necessitate developments in techniques for cesium removal. One such is the adsorption of cesium cations in Prussian blue (PB) materials, on which adsorption can be a substation process or pure physisorption. The underlying mechanism of the latter is not well understood, although a Langmuir isotherm is frequently used to model experimental results. In this work, we exploit tight-binding density-functional theory (DFTB) methods to probe the atomic interactions in the physisorption process. The results show that there is a diminishing return for the energy of adsorption as more sites are filled. This means that the adsorption sites are not independent, as stipulated by the ideal Langmuir isotherm. Instead, the results indicate that electrostatic effects need to be considered to explain the theoretical and experimental results. Therefore, an electrostatic Langmuir (EL) model is introduced, which contains an electrostatic ideality correction to the classic Langmuir isotherm. For future materials development, these physical insights indicate that shielding effects as well as the number of independent physical sites must be considered when synthesizing effective Prussian blue analogs (PBA). In conclusion, the study provides insights into the limiting mechanisms in the physisorption of cesium cations on PB.

TI On the role of potassium in Prussian blue analogue-derived Mn-Co
   catalysts applied in the CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The lowering of the K content of phase-pure Mn-Co-derived Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-based catalysts applied in higher alcohol synthesis was achieved by an additional washing step and by substituting K+ cations by (NH4)+ cations prior to synthesis. Adding the washing step to the microemulsion-assisted co-precipitation route resulted in a decrease from 3.1 wt% to 0.6 wt% K after pyrolysis, whereas substitution achieved a K content of only 0.2 wt%. During pyrolysis the washed PBA precursor decomposed in a single step resulting in a sharp mass loss at 540 degrees C, whereas the NH4-based precursor gave rise to a major broad peak at 390 degrees C. Correspondingly, strong changes of the textural and structural properties of the resulting porous carbon matrix with embedded Co0 were observed. Under HAS conditions the formation of bulk Co2C in close contact with Cohcp occurred as shown by in-depth structural investigations of the spent catalysts. Washing resulted in an increased total oxygenate selectivity up to 35%, whereas the CO2 selectivity of the substituted sample was decreased to 15% at a temperature of 260 degrees C, a pressure of 60 bar and a H2/CO ratio of 1. Both methods led to higher CO conversion, and the lowered K content of 0.6 wt% also resulted in a significantly higher selectivity of primary and secondary alcohols of 20% and 11%, respectively, due to the presence of more acidic Co-N-C sites.
   The lowering of the K content of phase-pure Mn-Co-derived Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-based catalysts applied in higher alcohol synthesis was achieved by an additional washing step and by substituting K+ cations by (NH4)+ cations prior to synthesis.

TI Switching Between Giant Positive and Negative Thermal Expansions of a
   YFe(CN)6-based Prussian Blue Analogue Induced by Guest
   Species
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB The control of thermal expansion of solid compounds is intriguing but remains challenging. The effect of guests on the thermal expansion of open-framework structures was investigated. Notably, the presence of guest ions (K+) and molecules (H2O) can substantially switch thermal expansion of YFe(CN)(6) from negative (alpha(v) = -33.67 X 10(-6) K-1) to positive (alpha(v) = +42.72 X 10(-6) K-1)-a range that covers the thermal expansion of most inorganic compounds. The mechanism of such substantial thermal expansion switching is revealed by joint studies with synchrotron X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption fine structure, neutron powder diffraction, and density functional theory calculations. The presence of guest ions or molecules plays a critical damping effect on transverse vibrations, thus inhibiting negative thermal expansion. An effective method is demonstrated to control the thermal expansion in open-framework materials by adjusting the presence of guests.

TI Water Contributes to Higher Energy Density and Cycling Stability of
   Prussian Blue Analogue Cathodes for Aqueous Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB In this work, we performed a comprehensive study of Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs), one of the most promising cathode materials for aqueous sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy-storage systems, using first-principles calculations. It is confirmed that dry PBAs generally undergo a phase transition from a rhombohedral Na2PR(CN)(6) (where P and R are transition metals) to a tetragonal/cubic PR(CN)(6) during Na extraction, in agreement with experimental observations. Using a grand potential phase diagram construction, we show that water and Na co-intercalation result in fundamentally different phase transition behavior and, hence, electrochemical voltage profiles in wet versus dry electrolytes. Lattice water increases the average voltage and reduces the volume change during electrochemical cycling, resulting in both higher energy density and better cycling stability. Finally, we identified four new PBA compositions, Na2CoMn(CN)(6), Na-2 NiMn(CN)(6), Na2CuMn(CN)(6), and Na2ZnMn(CN)(6), that show great promise as cathodes for aqueous rechargeable Na-ion batteries.

TI Fabrication of the multifunctional Pd modified NiCuFe Prussian blue
   analogue nanoplatform and its sensitive colorimetric detection of
   L-cysteine
SO SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY
AB It is essential to establish a simple, effective and sensitive platform for L-Cysteine (L-Cys) detection because the level of L-Cys is related to many diseases in the human body. Herein, we successfully fabricated polyaniline bridging NiCuFe Prussian blue analogue@palladium (NiCuFe@Pd) nanocomposite with integration of photo- thermal conversion performance and catalytic performance. And, various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques were adopted to prove the formation of the nanocomposite. 4-nitrothiophenol and 3,3 ',5,5 '- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) were employed to prove the catalytic activity of the nanocomposite. Due to the catalytic activity, the nanocomposite was used as a nanoplatform for colorimetric detection of L-Cys, which showed high sensitivity with a detection limit as low as 0.027 mu M. In addition, the excellent photothermal conversion performance makes it a potential candidate for photothermal therapy for various diseases. This study may be beneficial to promote the construction of novel nanostructures and their medical application.

TI Single, binary, and ternary nanocomposite electrodes of reduced graphene
   oxide@polyaniline@Co-Prussian analog for supercapacitors
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The present work includes fabrication of a binary and ternary and composites of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), Polyaniline (Pani), and cobalt Prussian blue analog (Co-PA) for high performance supercapacitor. The materials were characterized using XRD, SEM, FT-IR, and BET techniques. The results confirm the formation of the desired nanocomposites. The electrochemical properties were evaluated in three electrode configuration using CV, CCD and EIS methods. The ternary composite of RGO@Pani@Co-PA showed better electrochemical properties than that obtained from the binary composites as well as their constituent components. The ternary-based sample had a specific capacitance of 490 Fg(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and a minimal capacitance loss of 93.9% after 3000 electric cycles. The ternary composites' remarkable electrochemical performance has been attributed to their well-thought-out, distinctive architecture, which offers a substantial surface area and promotes synergistic effects among the other ingredients. The ternary RGO@Pani@Co-PA composite was used as the anode electrode (positive) and activated carbon as the cathode (negative) materials in the assembly of the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device. Over a wide potential window of 2 V, the fabricated ASC had a remarkable specific energy of 58.9 Wh kg(-1) at a specific power of 9210 W kg(-1) and 88.5% device capacitance stability after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge.

TI Highly effective and tunable microwave absorber integrating multiscale
   attenuation behaviours derived from prussian blue analogue/graphene
   oxide aerogel
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Tunable and efficient absorption of graphene-based microwave absorbers are essential on the realms of electromagnetic compatibility and protection in various application scenarios. However, challenges arise owing to their limited microwave attenuation behaviors. Herein, CoNiFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived magnetic alloy@carbon nanocubes anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels were achieved via CoNiFe-PBA nanocubes assisting assembly of GO and subsequent thermal annealing approach. Such three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based macroscopic architecture integrates multiple attenuation behaviours occurred across multiple length scales. Attributed to the synergy of multiple scattering, conduction loss, multiple heterogeneous interface and dipolar polarizations, and magnetic loss, the optimized CoNiFe-PBA/GO aerogel derivative simultaneously exhibits strong reflection loss and wide effective bandwidth with an ultralow filling content (1.1 wt%) at both X band (-66.01 dB and 5.2 GHz at 3.2 mm) and Ku band (-66.23 dB and 6.6 GHz at 2.6 mm). Multiscale assembly strategy of graphene-based electromagnetic functional materials from molecular level to macroscale proposed and demonstrated by this work shows promise for exploring tunable and efficient microwave absorbers.

TI A processable Prussian blue analogue-mediated route to promote alkaline
   electrocatalytic water splitting over bifunctional copper phosphide
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as a class of metal-organic frameworks demonstrate a promising platform to develop cost-effective high-performance electrocatalysts. However, the construction of delicate micro/nanostructures and controllable doping are still a challenging task for the fabrication of highly efficient copper-based electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of copper foam supported Cu3P@Co-Cu3P (CH@PBA-P/CF) sub-microwire arrays as an active electrocatalyst for alkaline water splitting. The Co-Cu3P shell derived from the Cu-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) PBA serves as the source of active sites. Co doping and construction of core-shell structures endow the CH@PBA-P/CF electrocatalyst with abundant catalytic sites, enhanced intrinsic activity, and low charge transport resistance. The catalytic electrode integrated with 3D copper foam and 1D sub-microwire arrays is highly conductive and stable, which promotes the charge transport and improves the structural stability. As a consequence, CH@PBA-P/CF shows impressive catalytic performances toward the HER and OER in terms of low overpotentials of 231 and 312 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Notably, the water electrolyzer using the CH@PBA-P/CF electrode exhibits better water splitting performance than the one using noble metal-based couples.

This buffer solution-based proton pool provides a relatively low and stable concentration of protons for the slow decomposition of sodium ferrocyanide to get highly crystalline and sodium rich Prussian blue, which can be used as the cathode for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.
   The HAc-NaAc buffer can provide a low and relatively stable proton concentration for the slow decomposition of sodium ferrocyanide and highly crystalline sodium-rich Prussian blue with low [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and coordinated water can be obtained.

TI Charge storage and capacitance-type properties of multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes modified with ruthenium analogue of Prussian Blue
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB The ruthenium analogue of Prussian Blue, ruthenium(II,III,IV) hexacyanoruthenate(II,III), was demonstrated to form ultra-thin films (deposits) of mixed-valent ruthenium-oxo species cross-linked with cyanoruthenates on the surfaces of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. This polynuclear inorganic material was characterized by various redox transitions effectively adding to the double-layer-type capacitive properties of carbon nanotubes. Fabrication of the redox system (in a form of ultra-thin deposits on carbon nanotube surfaces with the content of the oxocyanoruthenium deposit on the level of 15 wt%) was simply achieved by exposing nanostructured carbons to the mixture containing ruthenium(III) chloride and potassium hexacyanoruthenate(II) at pH 2. The composite (hybrid) material composed of carbon nanotubes and oxocyanoruthenium layers was considered here for the construction of symmetric electrochemical capacitor-type system. The specific capacitance, energy, and power densities were determined from the data of cyclic voltammetric, galvanostatic charging-discharging, and AC impedance measurements. The capacitor cell utilizing the composite material was characterized by increased specific capacitance (86 F g(-1)) which corresponds to the energy density of 2.9 Wh kg(-1) without noticeable changes in power performance in comparison to bare carbon nanotubes-type device.

TI Iron-Vanadium Incorporated Ferrocyanides as Potential Cathode Materials
   for Application in Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are potential replacements for lithium-ion batteries owing to their comparable energy density and the abundance of sodium. However, the low potential and low stability of their cathode materials have prevented their commercialization. Prussian blue analogs are ideal cathode materials for SIBs owing to the numerous diffusion channels in their 3D structure and their high potential vs. Na/Na+. In this study, we fabricated various Fe-V-incorporated hexacyanoferrates, which are Prussian blue analogs, via a one-step synthesis. These compounds changed their colors from blue to green to yellow with increasing amounts of incorporated V ions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum revealed that V3+ was oxidized to V4+ in the cubic Prussian blue structure, which enhanced the electrochemical stability and increased the voltage platform. The vanadium ferrocyanide Prussian blue (VFPB1) electrode, which contains V4+ and Fe2+ in the Prussian blue structure, showed Na insertion/extraction potential of 3.26/3.65 V vs. Na/Na+. The cycling test revealed a stable capacity of similar to 70 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 50 mA g(-1) and a capacity retention of 82.5% after 100 cycles. We believe that this Fe-V-incorporated Prussian green cathode material is a promising candidate for stable and high-voltage cathodes for SIBs.

TI Interface and electronic structure engineering induced Prussian blue
   analogues with ultra-stable capability for aqueous
   NH4<SUP>+</SUP> storage
SO NANOSCALE
AB Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AAIBs) are considered potential energy storage solutions due to their faster kinetics, eco-friendliness, and high safety. Yet, appropriate electrode material for AAIBs is in continual investigation. Here, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), Na0.73Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.88), are applied by a covalent bond assisted engineering with in situ polyaniline (PANI) polymerization. The synthesized PANI/Na0.73Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.88) hybrid (PNFF) inherited the advantages of the high conductivity of PANI and the stability of PBAs. The content of PANI had an effect on the electrochemical performance of PNFF. When served as cathode for AAIBs, the as-prepared PNFF-60 (PNFF with adjusted PANI content) delivers an enhanced reversible capacity of 92.5 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles. Even at a high current density of 2000 mA g(-1), 95.2% capacity retention (1000 cycles) can be achieved by PNFF-60. The ammonium storage mechanism of PNFF-60 is fully investigated by in situ Raman and ex situ XPS/FTIR analysis. Moreover, an aqueous NH4+ full cell is assembled by coupling the polyimide@MXene (PI@MXene) anode, exhibiting durable cycling stability. This work adds to the understanding of constructing PBAs-based hybrid electrodes for ammonium ion storage devices.

TI Thermal expansion in Prussian Blue analogs

SO SOLID STATE SCIENCES
AB Thermal expansion in Prussian Blue Analogs (PBAs) M-3[Cr(CN)(6)](2).nH(2)O (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; n = 10-16) was studied using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) as a function of temperature in the range 123-298 K. Standard chemical precipitation was used to prepare the materials and they were characterized using standard characterization techniques XRD, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. All materials were found to crystallize in the cubic structure with space group Fm (3) over barm. Strong compositional dependence of thermal expansion is found in this series of PBAs. While Mn-3[Cr(CN)(6)](2).12H(2)O and Ni-3[Cr(CN)(6)](2).16H(2)O show positive thermal expansion (PTE) behavior the other two PBAs, Fe-3[Cr(CN)(6)](2).10H(2)O and Co-3[Cr(CN)(6)](2).14H(2)O, show strong negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior with as large coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) as -19.7 x 10(-6) K-1 (for M = Fe) in the temperature range 123-223 K. For the PBAs showing NTE, the magnitude of NTE coefficients can be correlated with the trends for M cation size and cell (or lattice) parameter.

TI Copolymerization of Carbonyl Sulfide and Propylene Oxide via a

SO CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL
AB This study demonstrates the superiority of a stable and well-defined heterogeneous cobalt hexacyanocobaltate (Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)), a typical cobalt Prussian Blue Analogue (CoCo-PBA) that catalyzes the copolymerization of carbonyl sulfide (COS) and propylene oxide (PO) to produce poly(propylene monothiocarbonate)s (PPMTC). The number-average molecular weights of the PPMTC were 66.4 to 139.4 kg/mol, with a polydispersity of 2.0-3.9. The catalyst productivity reached 1040 g polymer/g catalyst (12.0 h). The oxygen-sulfur exchange reaction (O/S ER), which would generate random thiocarbonate and carbonate units, was effectively suppressed, and thus the selectivity of the monothiocarbonate over carbonate linkages was up to >99%. It was shown that no cyclic thiocarbonate byproduct was produced during the heterogeneous catalysis of COS/PO copolymerization using CoCo-PBA as the catalyst. The content of monothiocarbonate and ether units in the copolymer chain could be regulated by tuning the feeding amount of COS.

TI Engineering [Fe(CN)6]<SUP>3-</SUP> vacancy via
   free-chelating agents in Prussian blue analogues on reduced graphene
   oxide for efficient oxygen evolution reaction
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Development of efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for sustainable hydrogen production by water splitting. The physicochemical properties of the electrocatalyst can be tailored by defect engineering. Herein, we report the fabrication of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) coordination sphere vacancies via the rapid coprecipitation in Ni-3(II)[F-eIII (CN)(6)](2-x) (x <= 0.12) electrocatalyst anchored on reduced graphene oxide (v-NiFe PBA@rGO) for OER. The formation of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) coordination sphere vacancies (V-FeCN) via the rapid coprecipitation during the synthesis under the absence of chelating agents enables the regulation of electronic states of Ni active site, leading to the improvement in OER. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is employed as a substrate to maximize the concentration of V-FeCN and exposed active sites by the uniform formation of nano-sized Ni-3(II)[Fe-III (CN)(6)](2-x). The presence of V-FeCN and hybridization with rGO effectively suppress Fe leaching behavior. The v-NiFe PBA@rGO shows a low overpotential of 251 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline condition and the long-term stability for 200 h.

   bifunctional electrochromic supercapacitors
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB With the rise of portable and wearable electronic devices, it is becoming increasingly important to develop energy storage devices that can display their working status. In this article, an electrochromic supercapacitor was developed based on electroactive tetraaniline-sulfanilic acid polysiloxane (TASA) and versatile Prussian blue (PB). The electrode was prepared through electrochemistry-assisted hydrolytic crosslinking reaction coupled with electrochemical deposition. The as-synthesized electrochromic TASA/PB electrodes exhibit high electrochromic performances with high optical contrast, acceptable coloration efficiency of 92.7 cm(2) C-1, and good switching durability. It also exhibits specific capacitances as high as 273.4 F g(-1) at the current density of 0.25 A g(-1). The charge storage level (charged/discharged state) of the electrochromic supercapacitor based on TASA/PB electrode switches from green to blue, demonstrating the potential applications in energy storage and electrochromism for smart windows.

TI Synergistic Modification of Fe-Based Prussian Blue Cathode Material
   Based on Structural Regulation and Surface Engineering
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The Fe-based Prussian blue (Fe-PB) composite is considered as one of the most potential cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of its abundant iron resources and high theoretical capacity. However, the crystal water and vacancy in the Fe-PB structure will lead to poor capacity and cycle stability. In this work, a Cu-modified Fe-PB composite (FeCu-PB@CuO) is successfully prepared through regulating the Fe-PB structure by Cu doping and engineering the surface by CuO coating. The density functional theory calculation results confirm that Cu preferentially replaces Fe(HS )in the Fe-PB lattice and Cu doping reduces the bandgap. Our experiment results reveal that CuO coating can provide more active sites, inhibit side reactions, and potentially enhance the activity of Fe-HS. Due to the synergistic effect of Cu doping and CuO coating, FeCu-PB@CuO has a considerable initial discharge capacity of 123.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1). In particular, at 2 A g(-1), it delivers an impressive initial capacity of 84.3 mAh g(-1), and the capacity decreasing rate of each cycle is only 0.02% over 1500 cycles. Therefore, the synergistic modification strategy of metal ion doping and metal oxide coating has tremendous application potential and can be extended to other electrode materials.

TI Epitaxial growth of NixCo3-xS4 nanoflakes from co-based Prussian blue
   analog for high-performance pseudocapacitors
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this work, a NixCo3-xS4/PBA (Prussian blue analogue) heterostructure is obtained via a facile epitaxial growth method, forming a flower-like structure with NixCo3-xS4 nanoflakes standing independently on PBA. The 2D NixCo3-xS4 nanoflakes can provide sufficient reaction sites for charge storage, while the PBA core can facilitate quick ion transportation during charge/discharge process. Moreover, it has been shown that the growth of NixCo3-xS4 nanoflakes from PBA is a time-dependent reaction that could regulate the electronic state density of Co, Ni and S along the interface of NixCo3-xS4 and PBA. EELS and DFT calculations reveal that the formation of heterogeneous interface between NixCo3-xS4 nanoflakes and PBA results in an electron deficient region of NixCo3-xS4, which benefits the adsorption and reaction of OH- on NixCo3-xS4. With the structural and compositional merits, the NixCo3-xS4/PBA obtained with reacting for 7 h exhibits the superior specific capacitance and good rate capability with retaining 91.5 % of initial capacitance as well as quick charge response. The assembled NixCo3-xS4/PBA//AC asymmetric supercapacitor exhibit an energy density of 52.2 Wh kg-1, which could light 14 LED lamps with maintaining the brightness for 5 min. Therefore, the design of 3D NixCo3-xS4/PBA and the system-atical investigation on the structural evolution as well as the concomitant electron configuration regulation may not only inspire the design of high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors, but also be valuable for understanding the charge storage mechanism on heterostructures.

TI Zn-Fe PBA Films by Two-step Electrodeposition Method: Preparation and
   Performance in Electrochromic Devices
SO JOURNAL OF INORGANIC MATERIALS
AB Electrochromic materials can be used in new display devices because of their color-changing properties with applied voltage. The current multicolor electrochromic devices (MCECDs) are mostly prepared using several organic materials of different colors, and their process is relatively complicated, leaving preparation of simple MCECDs is still a challenge. In order to simplify the preparation process, we proposed a Prussian blue analogue composite electrochromic (MC PBA) film with four typical color states of red, blue, green, and yellow for excellent performance ECD. In this work, the preparation of a Zn- Fe Prussian blue analogue composite (Zn-Fe PBA) film was proposed by a two-step electrodeposition method. It has only one pair of redox peaks in the cyclic voltammetry curve, which corresponds to the redox reaction between Fe./Fe.. The electrochemical performance of the Zn-Fe PBA film is excellent, which hardly degrades after 10000 cycles. It is white with almost no color change during electrochemical redox, and does not affect the color when assembling multicolor electrochromic device (Z-MCECD) with MC-PBA film. In addition, the Zn-Fe PBA film is used as ion storage layer which can significantly reduce the overpotential from 4.0 V to 1.5 V in the corresponding ECD. Benefiting from the advantages of Zn-Fe PBA film, Z-MCECD maintains four typical color states of red, blue, green, and yellow, while the operating voltage is lower and the cycle stability is also significantly improved. The transmittance control range within 2400 s was almost no attenuated, and after 3600 s, transmittance still maintained 74.4% of the initial, while the multicolor group experienced completely irreversible performance loss after 1200 s. Z- MCECD has great application potential in color electrochromic display field.

TI Sn-mediated topological transformation of Archimedean polyhedra of
   Prussian blue analogues boosts the electrocatalytic performance for
   alkaline hydrogen production
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The exploitation of an extraordinary and low-cost electrocatalyst to solve energy shortage and environmental pollution issues is crucial. Herein, a topological Archimedean polyhedron of CoFe PBA (Prussian blue analogue) was synthesized via a Sn-induced crystal growth regulation strategy. After phosphating treatment of the as-prepared Sn-CoFe PBA, a Sn-doped binary CoP/FeP hybrid was obtained (Sn-CoP/FeP). Benefiting from the rough polyhedral surface and internal porous structure of Sn-CoP/FeP, when served as a highly efficient electrocatalyst, it exhibited outstanding HER performance, i.e., to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it required a low overpotential of 62 mV in alkaline medium, along with a long-term cycling stability for 35 h. This work is of great significance for the development of indispensable novel catalysts for hydrogen production, and would shed new light on the topology-related performance of electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.

TI Chemically Etched Prussian Blue Analog-WS2 Composite as a
   Precatalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation in Alkaline
   Media
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The electrochemical water-splitting reaction is a promising source of ecofriendly hydrogen fuel. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode impedes the overall process due to its four-electron oxidation steps. To address this issue, we developed a highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalyst by transforming Co-Fe Prussian blue analog nanocubes into hollow nanocages using dimethylformamide as a mild etchant and then anchoring tungsten disulfide (WS2) nanoflowers onto the cages to boost OER efficiency. The resulting hybrid catalyst-derived oxide demonstrated a low overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH and a high faradaic efficiency of 89.4%. These results were achieved through the abundant electrocatalytically active sites, enhanced surface permeability, and high electronic conductivity provided by WS2 nanoflowers and the porous threedimensional (3D) architecture of the nanocages. Our research work uniquely combines surface etching of Co-Fe PBA with WS2 growth to create a promising OER electrocatalyst. This study provides a potential solution to the challenge of the OER in electrochemical water-splitting, contributing to UN SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy.

TI A "copolymer-co-morphology" conception for shape-controlled synthesis of
   Prussian blue analogues and as-derived spinel oxides
SO NANOSCALE
AB The morphologically and compositionally controlled synthesis of coordination polymers and spinel oxides is highly desirable for realizing new advanced nanomaterial functionalities. Here we develop a novel and scalable strategy, containing a "copolymer-co-morphology" conception, to shape-controlled synthesis of various types of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). Three series of PBAs MyFe1-y[Co(CN)(6)](0.67)center dot nH(2)O (MyFe1-y-Co, M = Co, Mn and Zn) with well-controlled morphology have been successfully prepared through this strategy. Using MnyFe1-y-Co PBAs as the model, by increasing the relative content of Mn, flexible modulation of the morphology could be easily realized. In addition, a series of porous MnxFe1.8-xCo1.2O4 nano-dices with well-inherited morphologies and defined cation distribution could be obtained through a simple thermal treatment of the PBAs. All these results demonstrate the good universality of this novel strategy. When evaluated as an electrocatalyst, the octahedral-site Mn-III/Mn-IV content in MnxFe1.8-xCo1.2O4, mainly determined by sensitive Fe-57 Mossbauer in combination with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic techniques, was discovered to be directly correlated with the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activity.

TI Photoinduced chromism of a Zinc-Iron cyanide at room temperature

AB A room temperature (RT) chromism induced by illumination of -250-450 nm light was observed for the first time in a Prussian blue analog, Ko.Zn-26(2.87)[Fe(CN)6]2"7.2H(2)O. The photoinduced chromism is caused by the charge transfer from CN- to Fe3+ as manifested by IR and XPS measurements. Such an obvious chromic property controlled by certain optical stimuli at RT may have potential applications in optical devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Prussian Blue Analogue Derived Co3O4/CuO
   Nanoparticles as Effective Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst for
   Magnesium-Air Battery
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Developing efficient, durable, and cost-effective non-noble metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is necessary to promote the efficiency and performance of Mg-air batteries. Herein, the Co3O4/CuO nanoparticles were synthesized by a low-cost and simple approach using CuCo-based prussian blue analogue (PBA) as precursor of pyrolysis at different calcination temperatures. It was found that the Co3O4/CuO nanoparticles calcined at 600 degrees C (CCO-600) have relatively small size and superior ORR performance. The onset potential is 0.889 V and the diffusion limiting current density achieves 6.746 mA.cm(-2), as well as prominent stability in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The electron transfer number of the CCO-600 is 3.89 under alkaline medium, which indicates that the reaction mechanism of ORR is dominated by 4 e process similar to commercial Pt. The primary Mg-air battery with the CCO-600 as the cathode catalyst has been assembled and possesses better discharge performance than the CuCo-based PBA. The open circuit voltage of CCO-600 arrives at 1.76 V and the energy density reaches 1895.95 mWh/g. This work provides an effective strategy to develop non-noble metal ORR catalyst for the application of metal-air batteries. (C) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

TI Magnetic-Field-Induced Painting-Out of Precipitation Bands of
   Mn-Fe-Based Prussian Blue Analogues in Water-Glass Gels
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The effect of magnetic fields on the precipitation patterns of Mn-Fe-based Prussian blue analogues in water-glass gels was studied using X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopies. Three sets of two glass tubes, A, B, and C, were prepared using 1.20 M Mn2+/0.24 M [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), 0.60 M Mn2+/0.12 M [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), and 0.30 M Mn2+/0.06 M [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) solutions, respectively. From each of these sets, one tube was subjected to a magnetic field of 0.5 T, whereas the other was not. The magnetic field barely affected the Liesegang bands in the tube from Set A, but there were noticeable differences in the tubes from sets B and C, where (1) the amounts of electrolytes were small, (2) the dominant Mn species was [Mn(H2O)(6)](2+), and (3) there was stochasticity of the band formation. In these regions, the magnetic field painted out the spaces between the precipitation bands, even enhancing the formation of additional bands.

TI Effect of Zn-substitution induced structural regulation on sodium
   storage performance of Fe-based Prussian blue
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Fe-based Prussian blue (Fe-PB) has attracted wide attention as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to its open frame structure, abundant iron ore resources, and simple preparation. Nevertheless, the poor cycle performance caused by the [Fe(CN)(6)] defects and crystal water hinders its practical application. Herein, the FePB structure is regulated by Zn-substitution, and the effect of Zn-substitution induced structural regulation on sodium storage performance of Fe-PB is systematically investigated. The density functional theory calculation results confirm that Zn-substitution can reduce the bandgap and decrease the energy barrier of Na+ ions migration. Our experiment results further confirm the Zn-substituted Fe-PB composite (FeZn-PB) has a typical monoclinic structure with higher Na content, fewer [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies and lower crystal water. Moreover, Znsubstitution accelerates electrons and sodium ions migration and enhances the activity of both low-spin Fe and high-spin Fe. As a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries, the FeZn-PB electrode has a higher capacity and better cycle stability than Fe-PB. Especially, FeZn-PB delivers an initial capacity as high as 145.0 mAh g(-1) with a capacity contribution of 60.5 mAh g(-1) from low-spin Fe at 20 mA g(-1). Even at a high current density of 1 A g(-1), FeZn-PB still delivers a high initial capacity of 98.5 mAh g-(-1) with a very low capacity decay rate per cycle of only 0.05% over 500 cycles.

TI Core-Shell-Structured Prussian Blue Analogues Ternary Metal Phosphides
   as Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for OER and HER
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Electrochemical water splitting is regarded as the most potential sustainable hydrogen production technology. However, the slow reaction kinetics and high overpotential of this process will result in low energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, it is of great practical value to research low-cost, efficient, and stable transition-metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, Fe-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) was coated with Ni-Co PBA to prepare the trimetallic PBA precursor, and the trimetallic phosphate (Fe-Co-Ni-P-1) has been prepared via the low-temperature phosphating process. The effects of metal ratios, the amount of sodium hypophosphite, and phosphating temperature on the catalytic performances were studied. When Fe-Co-Ni-P-1 was used as an electrocatalyst, the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction was 247 and 215 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). At the same time, Fe-Co-Ni-P-1 showed faster kinetics and better long-term stability in the catalytic process. The catalytic performances of unary metal, binary metal, and ternary metal phosphides, oxides, and sulfides were systematically studied. It is demonstrated that the ternary metal phosphide Fe-Co-Ni-P-1 manifests the best catalytic performance, which is mainly attributed to the monodisperse core-shell structure, low resistance, large electrochemical active area, and the synergistic effect among metals.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Metal selenides have excellent theoretical capacity when used to store sodium. Compared with single metal selenides, bimetallic selenides stand out with excellent theoretical capacity, sufficient electrochemical re-action sites and good conductivity. In this work, Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 prussian blue analogue nanospheres are prepared by a static method with PVP as dispersant, and then heterostructure ZnSe/FeSe nanospheres (ZnSe/FeSe NS) composite are prepared by gas-phase selenation. PVP is conducive to the formation of loose and porous structures and alleviate the volume expansion during sodium storage. In this structure, het-erostructures can create abundant active sites and increase the electrochemical capacity. Therefore, the ZnSe/FeSe NS show high sodium storage capacity with a reversible capacity of 549.0 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and 436.8 mAh g-1 even after 100 cycles at 1 A g-1. It also shows excellent rate performance with high stable capacities of 524.6, 486.1, 447.3, 431.1, 417.9 mAh g-1 in a series of current densities of 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 mA g-1 separately. The excellent capacity of the ZnSe/FeSe NS composite comes from the active sites provided by the heterostructure and the high conductivity provided by the built-in electric field.

TI Fine synthesis of Prussian-blue analogue coated gold nanoparticles
   (Au@PBA NPs) for sorting specific cancer cell subtypes
SO SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY
AB Multiplex surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of markers without background in tumor biosystems has its superiority over other optical methods. Herein, we reported a strategy of quantitative discrimination of two breast cancer cell subtypes. Based on our previous studies, two kinds of Prussian blue analogue coated gold nanoparticles (Au@PBA NPs) were designed and synthesized by the replacement of Fe2+ with Pb2+ or Cu2+. Therefore, two distinct SERS emissions of C  N bonds at 2122 cm(-1) and 2176 cm(-1) have been acquired. When modified with aptamers of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which are both expressed in MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cell lines but in different levels, the SERS nanoprobes simultaneously identified the relative expression of these biomarkers on the cell surface, providing a good example for ratiometric detection in biosystems without any interference. Each surface marker of tumor cells corresponds to a single SERS emission. Thus, each subtype could be described in a molecular profiling way through duplex C  N bonds-based SERS emission, which is more advanced than traditional flow cytometry method. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI A novel synthesis of Prussian blue nanocubes/biomass-derived
   nitrogen-doped porous carbon composite as a high-efficiency oxygen
   reduction reaction catalyst
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Exploring efficient non-platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) instead of platinumbased catalysts is vital for reducing costs of fuel cells or metal-air batteries. A Prussian blue/N-doped porous carbon (PB/NPC) nanocomposite catalyst for ORR was synthesized by a novel method of one-step high-temperature pyrolyzing the mixture of the casein extracted with ferric ions, potassium hydroxide and melamine. The PB nanocubes were embedded in the NPC, and the particle size of PB nanocubes was less than 100 nm. The presence of PB effectively reduced the production of hydrogen peroxide, and the PB/NPC catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity such as more positive onset-potential (of similar to 0.93 V vs. RHE), large diffusion limiting current density (5.79mA cm(-2)) close to Pt/XC-72 (20%) catalyst and good stability in alkaline media due to the stable binding structure and the synergistic effect of PB nanocubes and NPC. The synthetic strategy of the PB/NPC provides a facile and effective method for the preparation of non-platinum catalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI A Self-Constructed Mg<SUP>2+</SUP>/K<SUP>+</SUP> Co-Doped Prussian Blue
   with Superior Cycling Stability Enabled by Enhanced Coulombic Attraction
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue (PB) is regarded as a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries because of its sustainable precursor elements (e.g., Mn, Fe), easy preparation, and unique framework structure. However, the unstable structure and inherent crystal H2O restrain its practical application. For this purpose, a self-constructed trace Mg2+/K+ co-doped PB prepared via a sea-water-mediated method is proposed to address this problem. The Mg2+/K+ co-doping in the Na sites of PB is permitted by both thermodynamics and kinetics factors when synthesized in sea water. The results reveal that the introduced Mg2+ and K+ are immovable in the PB lattices and can form stronger K-N and Mg-N Coulombic attraction to relieve phase transition and element dissolution. Besides, the Mg2+/K+ co-doping can reduce defect and H2O contents. As a result, the PB prepared in sea water exhibits an extremely long cycle life (80.1% retention after 2400 cycles) and superior rate capability (90.4% capacity retention at 20 C relative to that at 0.1 C). To address its practical applications, a sodium salts recycling strategy is proposed to greatly reduce the PB production cost. This work provides a self-constructed Mg2+/K+ co-doped high-performance PB at a low preparation cost for sustainable, large-scale energy storage.

TI Operando Electrochemical X-ray Diffraction and Raman
   Spectroscopic Studies Revealing the Alkali-Metal Ion Intercalation
   Mechanism in Prussian Blue Analogues
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Prussian blue analogues are promising cathode material candidates for aqueous rechargeable metal-ion batteries. Although great efforts have been made on developing materials, there are still rare reports on optimizing cell performance from mechanistic understanding and studies. Here we unveil the alkali-metal-ion intercalation mechanism in Berlin green with a home-built spectroelectrochemical cell for operando X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopies, which allows us to obtain the correlated local structure, crystal structure, redox activity, and potential profiles during the charging and discharging processes. We found that the intercalation of Na+ follows a solid solution mechanism leading to a high capacity, and the intercalation of K+. follows a two-phase transition mechanism showing a high voltage. With this understanding, we propose a new strategy using a Na+/K+ hybrid cation electrolyte to realize both high voltage and energy density. This study offers a unique insight for improving the cell performance from the understanding of the reaction mechanism.

TI CoS2 hollow nanocubes derived from Co-Co Prussian blue
   analogue: High-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In this paper, we demonstrate a two-step method to transform Co-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes into porous and hollow CoS2 nanocubes. The morphology and microstructures of the synthesized CoS2 hollow nanocubes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and automatic micropore physisorption analyzer. Electrochemical capacitive properties of the synthesized CoS2 hollow nanocubes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests in alkaline aqueous solution (2 M KOH). Results show that the porous CoS2 nanocubes have hollow and mesoporous structure with high specific surface area (113.9 m(2) g(-1)), and show a high specific capacitance of 936 F g(-1) at the current density of 1 A g(-1). Also, the CoS2 hollow nanocubes possess good power characteristics (the capacitance retention is 73.3% from 1 A g(-1) to 20 A g(-1)) and good long-term cycling life with 83% specific capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g(-1). Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ACS) was assembled by using CoS2 on carbon cloth and activated carbon (AC) on carbon cloth as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The prepared ACS shows a high energy density of 34.68 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 356.9 W kg(-1), 25.74 Wh kg(-1) remained at a power density of 7336.8 W kg(-1), and excellent rate performance (the capacitance retention is 74.2% from 0.5 to 10 A g(-1)). These indicate that the CoS2 hollow nanocubes are good candidates for the next-generation high performance supercapacitor electrode materials.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Cu2O@Cu-Fe-K Prussian Blue analogue (K-PBA) core-shell nanocube was synthesized by a facile template-engaged redox deposition approach, and could be used as an efficient catalyst for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER). The presence of K-PBA shell not only can protect the Cu2O active core, but also promote the ratios of multi-carbon products to competing methane in CO2ER, achieving a total C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 23.9% (ethylene 10.8%, ethanol 3.6% and n-propanol 9.5%) at -1.11 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), while j(total) = 6.2 mA cm(-2). It is suggested that K-PBA shell coating alter inherent adsorption energetics of Cu2O, which contributes to the C-C coupling step in CO2 ER. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Defect-Healing Induced Monoclinic Iron-Based Prussian Blue Analogs as
   High-Performance Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have attracted wide interest as a class of ideal cathodes for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries due to their low cost, high theoretical capacity, and facile synthesis. Herein, a series of highly crystalline Fe-based PBAs (FeHCF) cubes, where HCF stands for the hexacyanoferrate, is synthesized via a one-step pyrophosphate-assisted co-precipitation method. By applying this proposed facile crystallization-controlled method to slow down the crystallization process and suppress the defect content of the crystal framework of the PBAs, the as-prepared materials demonstrate high crystallization and a sodium-rich induced rhombohedral phase. As a result, the as prepared FeHCF can deliver a high specific capacity of up to 152.0 mA h g(-1) (achieving approximate to 90% of its theoretical value) and an excellent rate capability with a high-capacity retention ratio of 88% at 10 C, which makes it one of the most competitive candidates among the cathodes reported regarding both capacity and rate performance. A highly reversible three-phase-transition sodium-ion storage mechanism has been revealed via multiple in situ techniques. Furthermore, the full cells fabricated with as-prepared cathode and commercial hard carbon anode exhibit excellent compatibility which shows great prospects for application in the large-scale energy storage systems.

TI Electrochemically activated Co-Prussian blue analogue derived amorphous
   CoB nanostructures: an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen
   evolution reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The oxygen evolution reaction is a kinetically sluggish half-cell reaction which plays an important role in tuning the efficiency of various electrochemical energy conversion systems. However, this process can be facilitated by manipulating the composition and morphology of the electrocatalyst. Here, by tuning the annealing temperature, a series of cobalt borides (CoB@300, CoB@450, CoB@550 and CoB@650) were synthesized from a metal-organic framework Prussian blue analogue (PBA) following boronization. The resulting borides were characterized systematically and we explored their electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In an alkaline electrolyte, the in situ surface transformation of the boride working electrode to the corresponding metaborite and cobalt oxyhydroxide took place which thereafter acted as the active catalytic sites for the OER. Interestingly, the amorphous form of cobalt boride (i.e., CoB@300) shows many fold increased catalytic activity compared to those of crystalline CoB and commercial RuO2 requiring only 290 mV overpotential to reach the benchmarked 10 mA cm(-2) current density and the trend follows the order as CoB@300 > CoB@450 > CoB@550 > CoB@650 > PBA. The dominant catalytic activity of the amorphous cobalt boride nanostructure is attributed particularly to its amorphous nature and synergy between the in situ formed catalytically active centres (meta-borites and cobalt oxyhydroxide).

TI Insights into the mechanism of a substituted metal center regulating the
   enzymatic activity of Prussian blue analogues for catalytic
   antioxidation
SO NANOSCALE
AB Atom engineering has been demonstrated to be an efficient strategy for optimizing the activities of Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-based nanozymes. Herein, using a series of metal atom-coordinated N PBAs as models, a mechanistic insight into the effect of substituted metal centers on the antioxidant activities of PBA-based nanozymes is provided for the first time. The PBAs exhibit substituted metal atom-dependent antioxidant activities and the optimal Cu-substituted PBAs can effectively protect cells from oxidative stress. Experimental characterization reveals that the effect of low redox potential significantly improves the catalytic antioxidant efficiency. Furthermore, theoretical calculations show that the catalytic activities are well related to the magnetic moment of the adjacent Fe site, which features a linear correlation with the energy barrier of the rate-determining step or adsorption energy of the substrate, respectively. This study may inspire further exploration of PBAs and shed light on the rational design of advanced antioxidant nanozymes.

TI Ternary Ni-Co-Fe oxides based on Prussian blue analog for efficient
   photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction to CO and CH4
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction is an attractive way to alleviate the current energy crisis, but it is important to prepare catalysts with efficient catalytic capacity. In this work, Prussian blue analogs were firstly prepared, and then calcined to obtain porous transition metal (Ni, Co, Fe) oxides (TMOs). The metal composition of catalysts has great influences on their structures and catalytic properties. Among them, NCF-TMO catalyst shows excellent photothermal catalytic performance, and can produce 2.9 mmol g-1 h-1 CO and 1.6 mmol g-1 h-1 mmol CH4 at low CO2 and H2 concentrations. For the NCF-TMO, its superior catalytic performance mainly benefitted from two reasons: (1) The construction of heterojunction between NiO, Co3O4 and Fe2O3, which promotes the efficient dynamic processes of charge carriers; (2) The formation of abundant surface reactive active sites facilitates the efficient conversion of CO2 molecules. This study offers a bright direction for the resource utilization of CO2.

TI Structure design of Prussian blue analogue derived CoFe@C composite with
   tunable microwave absorption performance
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Manufacturing microwave absorbers with controllable microstructure is appealing continuous interest. Here, tunable structure of cobalt hexacyanoferrate submicrocubes (CoHCF) are fabricated via cation exchange method. Subsequently, porous cobalt iron alloys and carbon (CoFe@C) composites are obtained through annealed the CoHCF precursors at 500 degrees C. By simply adjust the reaction solvent of precursors, the CoHCF submicrocubes with yolk-shell, hollow, and mesoporous structure are obtained. The results show that the morphology and structure are important for enhancing the microwave absorption properties. Typically, the optimal reflection loss of CoFe@C submicrocubes with mesoporous structure is -73.63 dB at the absorber thickness of 2.6 mm, and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB, RL < -10 dB) is 5.0 GHz. This strategy provides a novel approach for the structural control of Prussian blue analogous (PBAs), which may be greatly helpful for the wide application of PBAs and their derivatives.

TI Nanocubic cobalt-containing Prussian blue analogue-derived carbon-coated
   CoFe alloy nanoparticles for noninvasive uric acid sensing
SO ANALYTICAL METHODS
AB This work describes an electrochemical sensor for the fast noninvasive detection of uric acid (UA) in saliva. The sensing material was based on a cobalt-containing Prussian blue analogue (Na2-xCo[Fe(CN)6]1-y, PCF). By optimizing the ratio of Co and Fe as 1.5 : 1 in PCF (PCF1.5,0), particles with a regular nanocubic morphology were formed. The calcination of PCF1.5,0 produced a carbon-coated CoFe alloy (CCF1.5), which possessed abundant defects and achieved an excellent electrochemical performance. Subsequently, CCF1.5 was modified on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) to fabricate the electrochemical sensor, CCF1.5/SPCE, which showed a sensitive and selective response toward salivary UA owing to its good conductivity, sufficient surface active sites and efficient catalytic activity. The determination of UA in artificial saliva achieved the wide linear range of 40 nM-30 mu M and the low limit of detection (LOD) of 15.3 nM (3 sigma/s of 3). The performances of the sensor including its reproducibility, stability and selectivity were estimated to be satisfactory.

TI Carboxylate-derived conductive, sodium-ion storable surface of Prussian
   Blue with a stable cathode-electrolyte interface
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Considering the high binding affinity between carboxylate ligands (-O-C=O) and alkaline Na ions, Prussian blue (PB) with a carboxylate-derived conductive, Na-ion storable surface is developed as a cathode material for Na-ion rechargeable batteries. Here, citric acid (CA) (C6H8O7) is introduced as a carboxylate source because, in a neutral aqueous solution, it loses two H ions of each molecule to reach an acid-base equili-brium and is stabilized in a chemical form with two -O-C=O ligands that are accompanied by two delo-calized electrons. Consequently, these functional groups newly formed from CA remain on the surfaces of PB particles even when PB is co-precipitated using CA and sodium citrate as dual chelating agents. Specifically, they strongly bind to high-spin Fe (FeHS) ions on the PB surface, providing additional active sites for Na-ion storage via a quasi-reversible, surface redox process (i.e., FeHS-R-C-O- H FeHS-R-C-O-Na) in the low-voltage region close to 3.0 V (vs. Na+/Na). During charge/discharge cycling, inserted Na ions prefer to be stored in the activated surface sites instead of being used to produce unstable by-products by electrolyte decomposition, which resultantly inhibits the thick growth of cathode-electrolyte interface (CEI) layers on the PB particles. As a result, 2 wt% CA-assisted PB exhibits high first discharge capacity (-110 mA h g-1) and low average capacity decay rate (-0.39 mA h g-1/cycle) at a current density of 0.2 C.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Spontaneous precipitation pattern formation by crystallites of
   Mn-Fe-based Prussian blue analogues in agarose gel
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Precipitation patterns spontaneously formed by Mn-Fe-based Prussian blue analogues (Mn-Fe PBAs) in agarose gel were investigated over wide concentration ranges for the outer (0.10 <= [Mn2+] <= 0.70 M) and inner electrolytes (0.01 <= [[Fe(CN)(6)](3-)] <= 0.35 M). The precipitation patterns were classified into five types: continuous in the inner electrolyte gel, continuous in the outer electrolyte gel, a very short band close to the gel boundary, periodic bands in the inner electrolyte gel, and filament-like patterns in the inner electrolyte gel. The concentrations found to be suitable for applications as pulsatile Cs-137 adsorbent delivery materials, for which the periodic patterns were most distinct and frequently occurring, were [Mn2+] approximate to 0.55 M and [[Fe(CN)(6)](3-)] approximate to 0.10 M. The filament-like pattern, reported here for the first time, was generated near the cylindrical gel surface in a local, stochastic, and two-dimensional manner. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the periodic band patterns indicate that the Mn-Fe PBA precipitates in periodic patterns consist of cubic crystallites (3-10 mu m, each side), suggesting significant contributions from Ostwald ripening to the precipitation process. In contrast, precipitates in the filament-like pattern consist of relatively smaller cubic crystallites (less than or similar to 1 mu m, each side), implying an important role of rapid nucleation in the formation of this structure. SEM observations also suggest that, overall, agarose gels support crystallite ripening more effectively, and hence also better suppress the formation of definite periodic bands, than water-glass gels. These findings provide useful information for future applications of self-assembled Mn-Fe PBA patterns in gels.

TI Fabrication of core-shell Prussian blue
   analogue@ZnIn2S4 nanocubes for efficient
   photocatalytic hydrogen evolution coupled with biomass furfuryl alcohol
   oxidation
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Utilizing photocatalytic technology for the value-added conversion of biomass derivatives, alongside the production of clean hydrogen energy, represents a viable approach to addressing energy and environmental challenges. However, the design of cost-effective and efficient photocatalysts remains a significant obstacle. In this work, we employed open-framework Prussian blue analogs as co-catalytic centers and combined them with ZnIn2S4 to construct a series of core-shell nanocube photocatalysts with varying metal compositions. This unique structure provides abundant photocatalytic redox-active sites and effectively facilitates the separation and transfer of photoinduced charges. By examining the oxidation of furfuryl alcohol (FOL) to furfural (FAL) with cooperative H2 evolution, the optimal Ni-Co PBA@ZnIn2S4 sample exhibited remarkable catalytic activity, achieving H2 and FAL yields of 739.3 and 705.2 mu mol g-1 h-1, respectively, which is approximately four times greater than that achieved with bare ZnIn2S4. This study offers valuable insights into the design of photocatalysts and the selection of co-catalytic metal centers.

TI One Pot Synthesis of Ammonium Rich Nickel Hexacyanoferrate as Stable
   Cathode Material for Ammonium-Ion Batteries
SO BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS
AB Rechargeable aqueous batteries based on ammonium-ion (NH4+) redox reactions shows great potential for large-scale energy-storage due to its plentiful supplies, environmental friendliness, intrinsic security, and sustainability. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are regarded to be one of the most promising electrode materials owning to high energy storage density, ease of synthesis, and excellent electrochemical performances. However, the synthesis of ammonium rich Prussian blue analogues is too complicated. Herein, a one pot synthesis of NH4+-rich nickel hexacyanoferrate (NNiHCF) is developed and the NH4+ storage chemistry is investigated. NNiHCF cathode is coupled with an activated carbon (AC) anode and (NH4)(2)SO4 aqueous electrolyte to assemble ammonium-ion batteries. The aqueous full cell demonstrates good electrochemical performance, such as 50.2 mAh g(-1) at the current rate of 2 C, and 60 % capacity retention in 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the fundamental characteristics of the reversible redox reaction and the durable structure of NNiHCF are revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical measurements. This work proposes a facile method for the synthesis of ammonium-rich Prussian.

TI Chemical etching and phase transformation of Nickel-Cobalt Prussian blue
   analogs for improved solar-driven water-splitting applications
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Although Prussian blue and its analogs (PB/PBAs) have open framework structures, large surface areas, uniform metal active sites, and tunable compositions, and have been investigated for a long time, owing to their unfavorable visible light responsiveness, they rarely been reported in photocatalysis. This largely limits their applications in solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Here, a continuous-evolution strategy was conducted to convert the poor-performance NiCo PBA (NCP) toward high-efficiency complex photocatalytic nanomaterials. First, chemical etching was performed to transform raw NCP (NCP-0) to hollowstructured NCP (including NCP-30, and NCP-60) with enhanced diffusion, penetration, mass transmission of reaction species, and accessible surface area. Then, the resultant hollow NCP-60 frameworks were further converted into advanced functional nanomaterials including CoO/3NiO, NiCoP nanoparticles, and CoNi2S4 nanorods with a considerably improved photocatalytic H2 evolution performance. The hollowstructured NCP-60 particles exhibit an enhanced H2 evolution rate (1.28 mol g-1h-1) compared with the raw NCP-0 (0.64 mol g-1h-1). Furthermore, the H2 evolution rate of the resulting NiCoP nanoparticles reached 16.6 mol g-1h-1, 25 times that of the NCP-0, without any cocatalysts.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Quaternary bimetallic phosphosulphide nanosheets derived from prussian
   blue analogues: Origin of the ultra-high activity for oxygen evolution
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Oxygen evolution reaction is a critical reaction for renewable energy technologies. Conventionally, metal phosphides or metal sulfides are active for HER, their OER activity is relatively poor. Herein, we have precisely prepared quaternary (NiFe)PS3 nanosheets as ultra-effective OER catalysts via a one-step sulfurization and phosphorization method with NiFe prussian blue analogues as precursors. The systematic results demonstrate that the coexistence of PBA, P and S sources is the keypoint for the nanosheet structure. The (NiFe)PS3 nanosheets show very good OER activity with a super-low overpotential (223 mV) to reach 10 mA cm(-2). However, from the energy diagrams, we find that the basal plane of (NiFe)PS3 is almost inert to OER due to the prohibitively high theoretical overpotential of 1.50 V, derives from the weak binding of OH* and OOH* intermediates, and only unsaturated Fe and Ni atoms locate on the (010) plane of (NiFe)PS3 are active for OER. The further ex situ characterizations demonstrate that the in-situ electrochemically formed oxohydroxide layer on the nanosheets contributes significantly to the OER actvity. This work not only provides a simple method to synthesize quaternary bimetallic phosphosulphide nanosheets, but also provides a deep understanding on the origin of the high activity of (NiFe)PS3 nanosheets.

TI Strong Electron Coupling Effect of Prussian Blue Analogs Derived
   Ultrathin Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Wrapped Fe-CoP for Enhanced Wide
   Spectrum Photocatalytic H2 Evolution
SO ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS
AB With the advantages of large specific surface area and high porosity of general metal-organic frame materials, russian blue analogs have broad application prospects in catalysis. In this work, a series of ultra-thin N-doped carbon coated Fe-CoP (Fe-CoP@NC) are prepared by phosphating Fe-Co-Co Prussian blue analogs (Fe-Co-Co PBA) in different degrees for the broad-spectrum photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The results show that Fe-CoP@NC-3 has the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 16.6 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 83 times greater than that of Fe-Co-Co PBA. The excellent stability of Fe-CoP@NC-3 is proved by cyclic experiments. The outstanding photocatalytic H-2 production activity of Fe-CoP@NC-3 can be ascribed to the strong electron coupling effect between Fe-CoP and N-doped carbon layer. The photogenerated electrons of Fe-CoP are transferred to the N-doped carbon layer, which is electron transport mediator accelerating the electron transfer and synergetic improving the hydrogen evolution efficiency. This work provides an effective strategy for designing an ultra-thin N-doped carbon layer coated phosphide photocatalyst with strong electron coupling effect.

TI Composite cathode with low-defect NiFe Prussian blue analogue on reduced
   graphene oxide for aqueous sodium-ion hybrid supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Although sodium-ion hybrid supercapacitor (Na-ion HSC) has attracted great interest, exploitation of suitable cathode materials for reversible Na+ insertion reaction remains a challenge. Herein, a novel binder-free composite cathode with highly crystallized NiFe Prussian blue analogue (NiFePBA) nanocubes in-situ grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was fabricated via sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7)-assisted co-precipitation and the subsequent ultrasonic spraying and chemical reduction. Profiting from the low-defect PBA framework and close interface contact of PBA and conductive rGO, the NiFePBA/rGO/carbon cloth composite electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 451F g-1, remarkable rate performance and satisfactory cycling stability in aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte. Impressively, the aqueous Na-ion HSC assembled with the composite cathode and activated carbon (AC) anode manifests a high energy density of 51.11 Wh kg -1, superb power density of 10 kW kg- 1 and the intriguing cycling stability. This work may open a door for scalable fabrication of binder-free PBA cathode material for aqueous Na-ion storage.

TI Time-Resolved Spectroscopy of Photoinduced Electron Transfer in
   Dinuclear and Tetranuclear Fe/Co Prussian Blue Analogues
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The dynamics of the photodriven charge transfer-induced spin transition (CTIST) in two Fe/Co Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) are revealed by femtosecond IR and UV/vis pump-probe spectroscopy. Depending on temperature, the known tetranuclear square-type complex [Co2Fe2(CN)(6)(tp*)(2)(4,4'-dtbbpy)(4)](PF6)(2) (1) exists in two electronic states. In acetonitrile solution, at <240 K, the low temperature (LT) phase is prevalent consisting of low-spin Fe(II) and low-spin Co(III), [(FeLsCoLsIII)-Co-II](2). Temperature rise is the reason behind thermally-induced CTIST toward the high temperature (HT) phase consisting of low-spin Fe(III) and high-spin Co(II), [(FeLsCoHsII)-Co-III], being prevalent at >300 K Photoexcitation into the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) band of the LT phase at 800 nm induces electron transfer in one Fe-Co edge of PBA 1 and produces a [(FeLsCoLsII)-Co-III] intermediate which by spin-crossover (SCO) is stabilized within 400 fs to a long-lived (>1 ns) [(FeLsCoHsII)-Co-III] species. In contrast, IVCT excitation of the HT phase at 400 nm generates a [(FeLsCoHsII)-Co-III] species with a lifetime of 3.6 ps. Subsequent back-electron transfer populates the vibrationally hot ground state, which thermalizes within 8 ps. The newly synthesized dinuclear PBA, [CoFe(CN)(3)(tp*)(pz*(4)Lut)]ClO4 (2), provides a benchmark of the HT phase of 1, i.e., [(FeLsCoHsII)-Co-III], as verified by variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy. The photoinduced charge transfer dynamics of PBA 2 indeed are almost identical to that of the HT phase of PBA 1 with a lifetime of the excited [(FeLsCoHsIII)-Co-II] species of 3.8 ps.

SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Improving overall water electrolysis efficiency is challenging due to difficulties in designing high-efficiency, non-noble metal oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. The key to success lies in improving the electrocatalyst's specific surface area and optimizing its electronic structure. In this study, a novel method for obtaining coronal manganese cobalt Prussian blue analogues (MnCo PBA) with high specific surface area was developed through simple chemical etching. The MnSe/CoSe2 composite, derived from coronal MnCo PBA, retains the high specific area characteristics of the precursor. The resulting coronal MnSe/CoSe2 demonstrates excellent OER performance, attributed to the high specific area composite MnSe/CoSe2, which exposes more active sites and promotes synergistic effects between its components. The overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 360 mV, and the electrocatalyst displays long-term stability of up to 200 hours. This work offers a unique and effective approach to designing high-performance OER electrocatalysts.

AB A Prussian blue analogue with cobalt (Na2-xCo[Fe(CN)(6)](1-y), PB-Co), which is often used as sodium-ion battery material, was found to be an excellent sensing material toward some biomolecules by calcination. PB-Co calcined at 750 degrees C for 1 h (PB-Co750-1) has the improved defects to facilitate the adsorption and the catalytic oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA).

In addition, the redox of the analytes was confirmed as the diffusion-controlled process via the kinetic study. The recoveries of AA, DA and UA in real samples were found between 91 % to 114 %. AA and UA in tablets, serums and urines could be determined by PB-Co750-1/SPE with the satisfactory results.

SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are considered as promising electrode materials due to their superior electrical conductivity and excellent redox activity. However, TMPs have rarely been reported as catalysts for lithium air batteries. In the present work, three-dimensional (3D) self-standing NiFeP@NC/BC (BC = biochar) electrode is fabricated by the initial deposition of Prussian blue analogues (PBA) on biomass and the subsequent one-step phosphating process with red phosphorous as the phosphorous source. The as-prepared electrode is directly applied as the cathode for Li-O-2 batteries, which delivers good electrochemical performance, such as high specific capacity of 10.9 mAh g(cathode)(-1) at a current density of 0.05 mA cm(-2), good rate capability, and long cycle life of >90 cycles. The rational design of this 3D self-standing cathode integrates the advantages of efficient electron transport network of biochar and sufficient accessible reaction sites of TMP catalysts.

However, crystal water and vacancy inevitably appear in the framework controlled by synthesis process, limiting severely the potassium storage. Herein, high crystallinity K1.86Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.87)center dot? (0.13)center dot 1.88H(2)O was synthesized through electrostatic assisted coprecipitation technology, which effectively increased the initial potassium content. Moreover, the microstructure is affected under the action of static electricity, resulting in a nano-structure and large specific surface area (102.5 m(2) g(-1)). Compared with the sample without electrostatic field, its electrochemical performances can be significantly improved with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 85.5%, capacity retention of 90.3% after 503 cycles at 1C and rate capability of 49 mAh g(-1 )at 10C. The new method opens up a way for the performance improvement of other Prussian blue-based cathodes.

TI One-step synthesis of 2D@3D hollow Prussian blue analogue as a
   high-performance bifunctional electrochemical sensor
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are a family of classic coordination polymers. They have been widely applied in various fields including electrochemical sensors. Cubic nanoparticle structure is their common morphology. It is still a great challenge to design a hollow and two-dimensional (2D) PBA material. Of course, it will be a significant surprise if a hollow cube and 2D sheet can be integrated into one material. In this work, we designed a simple one-step synthetic strategy and resolved the above difficulty, wherein a hollow cubic PBA covered by 2D ultrathin nanosheets was successfully constructed, namely hollow tremella-like PBA (HTPBA). Furthermore, Ni foam (NF) as a substrate was introduced to obtain a self-supporting HTPBA/NF-12 electrode. HTPBA/NF-12, as a bifunctional electrochemical sensor electrode, exhibited distinguished catalytic performance towards glucose and nitrite, including remarkable selectivity, reproducibility, sensitivity for glucose (21 410 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)) and nitrite (1248 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)), wide linear range of 2-1250 mu M and 5-3380 mu M, along with low detection limit of 0.056 mu M and 0.38 mu M, respectively. More importantly, HTPBA/NF-12 electrodes possessed good reusability and practicability even in goat serum. In this study, we developed a simple and effective strategy to fabricate 2D@3D PBA material with excellent electrocatalytic activity and provide a totally new viewpoint in the PBA sensing field.

TI Construction of Fe-doped NiS-NiS2 Heterostructured
   Microspheres Via Etching Prussian Blue Analogues for Efficient
   Water-Urea Splitting
SO SMALL
AB Developing efficient and robust non-precious-metal-based catalysts to accelerate electrocatalytic reaction kinetics is crucial for electrochemical water-urea splitting. Herein, Fe-doped NiS-NiS2 heterostructured microspheres, an electrocatalyst, are synthesized via etching Prussian blue analogues following a controlled annealing treatment. The resulting microspheres are constructed by mesoporous nanoplates, granting the virtues of large surface areas, high structural void porosity, and accessible inner surface. These advantages not only provide more redox reaction centers but also strengthen structural robustness and effectively facilitate the mass diffusion and charge transport. Density functional theory simulations validate that the Fe-doping improves the conductivity of nickel sulfides, whereas the NiS-NiS2 heterojunctions induce interface charge rearrangement for optimizing the adsorption free energy of intermediates, resulting in a low overpotential and high electrocatalytic activity. Specifically, an ultralow overpotential of 270 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is achieved. After adding 0.33 M urea into 1 M KOH, Fe-doped NiS-NiS2 obtains a strikingly reduced urea oxidation reaction potential of 1.36 V to reach 50 mA cm(-2), around 140 mV less than OER. This work provides insights into the synergistic modulation of electrocatalytic activity of non-noble catalysts for applications in energy conversion systems.

TI Prussian blue analogues derived electrocatalyst with multicatalytic
   centers for boosting oxygen reduction reaction in the wide pH range
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Due to the complex of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), designing catalysts with multicatalytic centers is considered as a promising way for boosting the ORR. Herein, a multicatalytic centers electrocatalyst Fe3C/Mn3O4 encased by N-doped graphitic layers (FeMn PDA-900) is synthesized using iron manganese Prussian blue analogues and dopamine as the precursor. It exhibits a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.86 V for ORR and yields of H2O2 lower than 5% in 0.1 M KOH. Moreover, the prepared catalyst has also shown high catalytic ORR performance in both acidic and neutral electrolyte solutions, which exhibits the potential application in both the proton exchange membrane fuel cell and the microbial electrolysis cell. It is found that the good performance can be well explained by proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism due to the multicatalytic centers from Fe-Nx, Fe3C and Mn3O4 for providing enough active sites at the same time and the N-doped graphitic layers as a bridge for facilitating the electron transfer between the interfaces of Fe3C/Mn3O4 nanoparticles, which paves the way for protons and electrons transfer simultaneously and rapidly, and thus lowing the energy barrier and facilitating the ORR process. Therefore, FeMn PDA-900 is a promising candidate to replace precious metal-based ORR electrocatalysts at the whole pH range. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Open-Circuit Potential Drift in Intercalation Electrodes: Role of Charge
   Redistribution in a Prussian Blue Analog
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are used as electrode materials in energy storage and water deionization cells due to their reversible cation intercalation capability. Despite extensive research on their performance and intercalation mechanisms, little attention has been given to their behavior under open-circuit conditions. Recent studies using symmetrical PBA electrodes in two electrode deionization cells reported that after constant current cycling in dilute NaCl (<0.2 M), the cell voltage dropped under open-circuit conditions, which substantially increased the amount of energy consumed for deionization. However, it remains unclear which electrode (anode/cathode) experienced potential drift and if it was influenced by the low salinity of the electrolyte. Here, we performed a series of electrochemical experiments under different charging and discharging regimes and electrolyte compositions to determine the processes that contributed most significantly to open-circuit potential drift. The data indicated that charge redistribution within the electrode was the main contributor to open circuit potential drift, with electrode dissolution and parasitic reactions playing negligible roles. A one-dimensional finite element model was constructed to simulate charge redistribution by accounting for cation diffusion under open-circuit conditions. The open-circuit potential profiles generated by the model were validated against experimental trends, confirming the occurrence of charge redistribution. A Monte Carlo analysis of the model was conducted to determine the relationship of potential drift to key factors such as applied current, electrode thickness, diffusion coefficient of intercalating ions, and intercalation capacity. Subsequently, a dimensionless number (Da) was developed based on the Dahmkohler number to relate the extent of potential drift resulting from combinations of these factors. The analyses revealed a strong positive correlation between simulated potential drift and Da. Among the key factors studied here, the diffusion coefficient and applied current had the largest impact on Da and, consequently, on potential drift.

TI Preparation of CoFe@N-doped C/rGO composites derived from CoFe Prussian
   blue analogues for efficient microwave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB At present, in order to solve the problem of microwave radiation and interference, it is urgent to study high performance microwave absorption (MA) materials with strong absorption ability, light weight, thin thickness and broad bandwidth. In this work, CoFe@nitrogen-doped carbon/rGO (CoFe@NC/rGO) com-posites derived from CoFe Prussian blue analogues were successfully prepared by in situ growth and annealing. And the effects of GO content on the MA performances of the composites were studied system-atically. Results reveal that MA properties of CoFe@NC/rGO composites are enhanced by introduction of GO, this is mainly because the addition of GO can provide large specific surface area for microwave reflec-tion, enhance interfacial polarization and compensate the insufficient dielectric loss. Moreover, impe-dance matching, conduction loss and attenuation ability are also improved obviously. CoFe@NC/rGO composites show outstanding MA capability, and the minimum reflection loss is up to-53.0 dB at a thickness of 2.4 mm, the largest effective absorption bandwidth can achieve 4.48 GHz at a thin thickness of 1.7 mm. In consideration of the superior MA performances, the CoFe@NC/rGO composites will be ideal candidates for high-efficient MA applications. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Regulating valence states of CuFe-PBA for the simultaneous
   electrochemical detection of Cd 2+, Pb 2+and Hg 2+in food application
SO TALANTA
AB Prussian blue analogues, as prospective electrode materials, play a crucial role in detecting heavy metal ions (HMIs), a process closely related to their electron transfer capacities and active surfaces. Here, etched copperiron Prussian blue analogues (CuFe-PBA) are synthesized through a combination of flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) and an alkali etching process. Furthermore, this study investigates the impact of ammonia on the electronic structure of CuFe-PBA and its electrochemical detection capabilities for HMIs. The etched CuFe-PBA (eCuFe-PBA) exhibits excellent detection performance for Cd 2 & thorn; , Pb 2 & thorn; and Hg 2 & thorn; with 17.6 mu A mu M -1 , 24.2 mu A mu M - 1 and 26.2 mu A mu M -1 , respectively, due to the fact that the ammonia etching not only modulates the electronic properties of the surface of CuFe-PBA but also reduces the degree of agglomeration and enhances the accessible surface area. Additionally, it demonstrates excellent stability and resistance to interference, having been successfully applied to detect HMIs in food samples such as preserved eggs and apple juice. These results provide a new strategy for the use of Prussian blue analogues as electrochemical sensors for food safety applications.

TI Charge transfer induced highly active low-spin iron of Prussian blue
   cathode through calcination strategy for high performance Sodium-ion
   batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues have garnered considerable attention due to their spacious open framework, substantial specific capacity, facile synthesis protocol and cost-effectiveness as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nonetheless, the incomplete electrochemical reaction of low-spin (LS) Fe often results in suboptimal practical specific capacity and diminished specific energy. In this study, a calcination strategy is put forward and successfully activates LS-Fe centers within PB, which exhibits a prolonged high-voltage plateau when employed as a cathode material for SIBs. Notably, PB with LS-Fe activated (denoted as PB-325) contributes with a specific capacity of 65 and 62 mAh/g during the first and fifth charge-discharge cycles, respectively, surpassing those of the pristine material. Comprehensive investigations involving operando 57Fe Mo<spacing diaeresis>ssbauer spectroscopy, ex situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations unveil a charge transfer-induced spin transition phenomenon occurring during the electrochemical reaction process, which involves transfer of charges from HS-Fe to LS-Fe. The intrinsic narrower bandgap and charge-accumulated LS-Fe species both contribute to enhanced reactivity, especially in LS-Fe site, thus leading to increased specific capacity within the high-voltage range and improving the performance of PB-325. This study provides an effective and simple strategy to activate LS-Fe, and deepens the understanding of the mechanisms of highperformance PB cathodes for SIBs.

TI Ultrathin TiO2(B) nanosheets-decorated hollow CoFeP cube as PMS
   activator for enhanced photocatalytic activity
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB A novel TiO2(B)/phosphidated CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFeP) photocatalyst with core-shell structure was synthesized by hydrothermal method for the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade TC under solar light. TiO2(B), an ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) layered material, is widely used in photocatalysis. However, the low light absorption efficiency and slow electron mobility limit the application of TiO2(B) in photocatalysis. Here, TiO2(B) was in-situ grown on the surface of phosphidated CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFeP). The com-posites with a core-shell structure can activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade tetracycline (TC) under solar light. The optimized TiO2(B)/CoFeP heterojunction achieves a TC degradation rate of 94 % within 5 min, due to that it effectively suppresses the recombination of photogenerated charges and improves light absorption ability. The phosphorization of CoFePBA (CoFe Prussian blue analogs) not only promoted the formation of hollow structures but improved the carrier mobility between TiO2(B) and CoFeP. At the same time, the rapid redox cycle of Fe and Co metal ions promoted the activation of PMS and the rapid degradation of TC. This work provides a new core-shell TiO2(B)/CoFeP heterojunction for sustainable water purification via PMS activation.

TI Design of Prussian Blue Analogue-Derived Magnetic Binary Ce-Fe Oxide
   Catalysts for the Selective Oxidation of Cyclohexane
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB We report the fabrication of Ce-Fe oxides (CFOs) derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with different shapes of sphere (CFO-S), bipyramid (CFO-B), and flower (CFO-F), which are prepared by controlling the volume ratio of water and ethanol and the addition of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to control the solvent environment using a modified coprecipitation method. The structure, morphology, and the surface properties of Ce-Fe oxides were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalytic performance of PBA-derived Ce-Fe oxides was evaluated for the oxidation of cyclohexane, which positively correlated with surface oxygen vacancy and the amount ratio of Ce/Fe. The conversion for cyclohexane of CFO-S and CFO-B was 9.03 and 9.25%, respectively. However, CFO-S had a higher selectivity for K/A-oil (cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol) of 81.8%, resulting from the exposed crystal plane (100) compared to CFO-B(75%). Besides, CFO-F was rich in the Fe2O3 crystal phase, which is beneficial for KA selectivity. It was found that Ce3+, Fe3+, and OV had an important influence on the activation of C-H bonds, which provides a reference for the design of efficient alkane oxidation catalysts.

TI Multifunctional Ultrathin Amorphous CoFe-Prussian Blue Analogue
   Catalysts for Efficiently Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Activity of
   Nanorods Photoanode
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Developing efficient, durable, and inexpensive oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) have no alternative to designing efficient photoanodes for water splitting. Here, we demonstrate a simple strategy of fabricating a CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFePBA) water oxidation catalyst-coupled antimony-doped TiO2 (Sb-TiO2) nanorod (NR) photoanode with enhanced photocurrent density (1.48 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), high photoconversion efficiency (0.53% at 0.42 VRHE), and reduced onset potential (0.05 VRHE). Synergistic coupling between the CoFe-PBA and SbTiO2 NRs leads to numerous advantages, where the light-harvesting efficiency of the nano-heterostructure photoanode enhances >50% in the visible wavelength region. The CoFe-PBA catalyst also reduces the bulk carrier recombination in Sb-TiO2 NRs, serving as a surface passivation overlayer. The density functional theory (DFT) and valance band (VB) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies demonstrate the tuning of the electronic structure of the hybrid photoanode with a favorable band alignment enabling rapid photocarrier injection. Ultrathin CoFe-PBA catalysts also accelerate hole extraction from Sb-TiO2 NRs and readily transfer the holes toward the electrode/electrolyte interface, boosting the hole transfer efficiency (similar to 95% at 1.23 VRHE) and prolonging the hole lifetime for water oxidation. This work highlights the mechanism of the multifunctional activity of CoFe-PBA-coupled Sb-TiO2 NR photoanodes.

TI Enhancing Interfacial Dynamic Stability Through Accelerated
   Reconstruction to Inhibit Iron-Loss During Initial Electrochemical
   Activation
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, such as those containing Fe, often face the challenge of severe dissolution of active elements. Addressing this concern through the establishment of a dynamically stable interface during OER presents a promising strategy, achieved by manipulation of catalyst components. Herein, the findings reveal that Fe loss during OER predominantly occurs during the initial activation phase, marked by irreversible structural distortion that disrupts interfacial dynamical stability. By investigating the structural evolution of Fe-containing Prussian blue analogs, serving as a model OER precatalyst, the correlation between precatalyst structural changes and interfacial dynamic stability is elucidated. Utilizing thermal annealing of CoFe bimetal Prussian blue, favorable thermodynamic conditions are induced for generating cyano vacancies within the matrix, thereby facilitating enhanced initial activation during OER. Consequently, catalytically active and stable oxyhydroxide species rapidly form at the interface, exhibiting robust interactions with interfacial Fe elements to stabilize interface dynamics. Suppression of the irreversible structural distortion responsible for active element loss during initial activation culminates in enhanced OER activity and stability.

TI Spinel-type bimetal sulfides derived from Prussian blue analogues as
   efficient polysulfides mediators for lithium-sulfur batteries
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB More and more attentions have been attracted by lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S), owing to the high energy density for the increasingly advanced energy storage system. While the poor cycling stability, due to the inherent polysulfide shuttle, seriously hampered their practical application. Recently, some polar hosts, like single metal oxides and sulfides, have been employed as hosts to interact with polysulfide intermediates. However, due to the inherent poor electrical conductivity of these polar hosts, a relatively low specific capacity is obtained. Herein, a spinel-type bimetal sulfide NiCo2S4 through a Prussian blue analogue derived methodology is reported as the novel host of polysulfide, which enables high-performance sulfur cathode with high Coulombic efficiency and low capacity decay. Notably, the Li-S battery with NiCo2S4-S composites cathode still maintains a capacity of 667 mAh/g at 0.5 C after 300 cycles, and 399 mAh/g at 1 C after 300 cycles. Even after 300 cycles at the current density of 0.5 C, the capacity decays by 0.138% per cycle at high sulfur loading about 3 mg/cm(2). And the capacity decays by 0.026% per cycle after 1000 cycles, when the rate is 1 C. More importantly, the cathode of NiCo2S4-S composite shows the outstanding discharge capacity, owing to its good conduction, high catalytic ability and the strong confinement of polysulfides.

TI Preparation of a copper-substituted Prussian blue analogue-immobilized
   membrane suitable for efficient Cs removal in complex geothermal water
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian blue analogue (PBA) membranes for efficient Cs removal via in situ synthesis have attracted much interest. Herein, copper-substituted PBA was developed and optimized on the surface of a substrate with the aid of tannic acid (TA). The fabricated Cu-PBA-TA membrane was systematically investigated for its Cs adsorption property in static and dynamic experiments. The as-prepared membrane showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 265.0 mg g-1, which was the highest when compared to that of previously reported PBA membranes. Applied in geothermal water, the Cu-PBA-TA membrane showed favorable selectivity (Kd, 8680 mL g-1) and the removal rate of Cs+ was about 90%. Its fast adsorption rate that reached equilibrium within 40 min and the benign reusability in the dynamic treatment of geothermal water confirmed the potential of the membrane for large-scale application.

TI Prussian blue analogs derived Fe-Ni-P@nitrogen-doped carbon composites
   as sulfur host for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have drawn a lot of attention owing to the high theoretical capacity of 1675 mAh g(-1), environmental friendliness and relative abundance of sulfur. Nevertheless, the severe dissolution and migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and poor conductivity of sulfur greatly hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this work, Fe-Ni-P@nitrogen-doped carbon (named as Fe-Ni-P@NC) derived from Fe-Ni Prussian blue analog (Fe-Ni PBA) was used as highly efficient sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The Fe-Ni-P particles not only enhance the adsorption of LiPSs but also effectively promote the conversion of LiPSs. In addition, the CN- of PBAs can readily generate nitrogen-doped carbon during pyrolysis, which can improve the conductivity of composites. Due to these advantages, Li-S batteries using S@Fe-Ni-P@NC composites cathodes exhibited good electrochemical performance with outstanding rate capability and stable cycling over 500 cycles with a lower capacity fading rate of 0.08% per cycle at 1 C.

TI Enhanced kinetics and super selectivity toward Cs<SUP>+</SUP> in
   multicomponent aqueous solutions: A robust Prussian blue
   analogue/polyvinyl chloride composite membrane
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Developing effective adsorbents for Cs-137 removal from complex wastewater systems has been a significant challenge. Although existing spheres adsorbents could improve the post-separation ability and practical operability, the adsorption kinetics are still significantly retarded due to the large intra-particle diffusion resistance. Here, we demonstrate the efficiency of a robust Prussian blue analogue/polyvinyl chloride composite membrane (PPM), which was easily prepared by a simple solvent evaporation method. In virtue of the less dense layer and ion-sieving functionality, it showed enhanced kinetics (5 h) and super selectivity (S-F = 248.3-5388.6) towards Cs+. New PPM was robust within a wide pH range (2-10) and exhibited favorable removal capacity (152.8 mg/g), placing it at an outstanding material for Cs+ removal among other adsorbents. Moreover, PPM could be simply eluted and reused using a KCl solution as eluent. A study of the adsorption mechanism confirmed an ion-exchange action during the removal process. Thus, PPM is considered to be a promising candidate for the removal of Cs+ from multicomponent aqueous solutions

TI Phosphorization of a Prussian blue analogue-derived Co-N-C catalyst for
   synchronously boosting the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB The development of sustainable energy technologies and devices urgently requires reasonable construction of inexpensive and high activity bifunctional electrocatalysts. However, different active sites are required for bifunctional electrocatalysts, increasing the complexity of electrocatalyst construction. In this study, a bifunctional electrocatalyst (denoted as CoP-NPC) which consists of CoP nanocubes and Co-N-C sites embedded on the N,P co-doped carbon matrix is synthesized by a pyrolysis-phosphorization approach of the composite of the CoCo-Prussian blue analogue (CoCo-PBA), graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (GCNS), polydopamine (PDA) and sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2). The phosphorization process induces the synergism of CoP, Co-N-C, and NPC, providing abundant and efficient catalytically active sites. As a result, the CoP-NPC displays significant improvement in electrocatalytic activities with a half-wave potential of 0.821 V and a low overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the ORR and OER. Moreover, the CoP-NPC material exhibits outstanding stability and tolerance to methanol. This study provides a facile phosphating strategy to simultaneously boost the catalytic activity of bifunctional electrocatalysts.

TI Efficient difunctional photocatalyst prepared in situ from
   Prussian blue analogues for catalytic water oxidation and visible-light
   absorption
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The photocatalytic water oxidation reaction (WOR) usually requires the use of a noble metal catalyst as well as a photosensitizer, therefore developing new types of non-noble metal and photosensitizer-free catalysts is of great significience for the photocatalytic WOR. In this paper, a facile paradigm for designing photosensitizer-free difunctional catalysts from old fashioned cubic MOFs as Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) is presented. The as-prepared Co(OH)(2)-modified CuO (Co(OH)(2)/CuO) nanoparticles displayed robust catalytic efficiency (3567 mol h(-1) g(-1)) toward visible-light-driven water oxidation reaction (WOR). Intriguingly, insights into the WOR pathway indicated that the Co(OH)(2)/CuO nanoparticles could serve as both water oxidation catalysts and visible light absorption centers and they still showed photocatalytic performance under monochromatic light at 765 nm and maintained 64.2% oxygen evolution compared to the case with light cutting off at 420 nm. The Co(OH)(2)/CuO nanoparticles were shown to be quite stable in the reaction system via characterizing their properties before and after the reactions. While the synergetic effect between Co(OH)(2) and the CuO clusters was found to be key to the abnormal photocatalytic activity of this catalyst in the complicated WOR process. We hope that this contribution will serve as a useful template for other researchers to design new transition metal catalysts for WOR.

TI Insertion of Calcium Ion into Prussian Blue Analogue in Nonaqueous
   Solutions and Its Application to a Rechargeable Battery with Dual
   Carriers
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB We observed the first electrochemical insertion of Ca2+ into Prussian blue analogue, MnFe(CN)6, in nonaqueous solutions of Ca(CF3SO3)(2) and various solvents including ionic liquid at 60 degrees C. The kinetics for the Ca2+ insertion reaction were studied by cyclic voltammetry, and were compared to those of Na+ intercalation. By coupling this phenomenon with metallic anodes, two energy storage devices were made. Ca anode produced a primary cell that operated at a voltage of around 2.0 V. When Mg plate was used as an anode, the negative active material associated with CF3SO3-, which we have already reported was newly formed at the surface of Mg plate. By combining the negative active material, we have fabricated a novel rechargeable battery using dual ion transport species of Ca2+ for the cathode and CF3SO3- for the anode, and demonstrated that the battery showed repeated discharge/charge performance.

TI Mechanistic insight in site-selective and anisotropic etching of
   prussian blue analogues toward designable complex architectures for
   efficient energy storage
SO NANOSCALE
AB Engineering coordination compounds,e.g., prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs), with designable complex nanostructuresviachemical etching holds great opportunities for improving energy storage performances by adjusting topological geometry, selectively exposing active sites, tuning electronic properties and enhancing accessible surface area. Unfortunately, it remains ambiguous particularly on site-selective and anisotropic etching behaviors. Herein, for the first time, we propose that two distinct regions are formed inside NiCo PBA (NCP) cubes due to the competition between classical ion-by-ion crystallization and non-classical crystallization based on aggregation. Such a unique structure ultimately determines not only the etching position but also the anisotropic pathway by selectively exposing unprotected Ni sites. According to this principle, complex PBA architectures, including nanocages, open nanocubes (constructed by six cones sharing the same apex), nanocones, and chamfer nanocubes can be intentionally obtained. After thermal annealing, NCP nanocones are converted to morning glory-like porous architectures composed of NiO/NiCo(2)O(4)heterostructures with a mean particle size of 5 nm, which show improved rate performance and cycling stability.

TI Facile preparation of Prussian blue analogue
   Co3[Co(CN)6]2 with fine-tuning color
   transition temperature as thermochromic material
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB For thermochromic materials, a fine-tuning thermochromic property is always pursued to in order to realize their full potential. However, to date, realizing the fine-tuning still remains a great challenge and is seldom reported. In the present work, the Prussian blue analogue, Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2), with fine-tuning color transition temperature is synthesized through a facile wet-chemical method. By simply adjusting the amount of sodium citrate in the system, part of the ligand water molecules coordinated to lattice Co(II) can be substituted by citrate, which is confirmed by DFT calculations and experimental results, resulting in a color transition versus temperature as a response to a coordination environmental change of the Co(II). Finally, a fine-tuning color transition temperature from 40 to 80 degrees C is realized with the color changing from pink to blue upon heating. In addition to the tunable color transition temperature, a high color transition speed and long term stability were also achieved due to the porous and stable lattice structure of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a metal-organic framework ( MOF) with a fine-tuning reversible thermochromic property, and the present controlled strategy might be expanded to the preparation of other similar materials.

TI Dual Ion Co-Insertion Induced Spontaneous and Reversible Phase
   Conversion Chemistry for Unprecedented Zn<SUP>2+</SUP> Storage
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Prussian blue analogues are highly promising electrode materials due to their versatile electrochemical activity and low cost. However, they often suffer from severe structural damage caused by the Jahn-Teller distortion and dissolution of high-spin outer metal ions, resulting in poor cycle life. Material modification and electrolyte regulation have been the common approaches to address this issue, albeit with very limited success. We report here a novel and efficient strategy to preserve structural stability by co-inserting Co2+ and Zn2+ ions in KCo[Fe(CN)6]. This co-insertion induced a spontaneous and reversible phase conversion by the replacement of low-spin inner ion (Fe3+), which efficiently relieves structural damage caused by Jahn-Teller distortion and metal-ion dissolution, leading to an outstanding Zn2+ storage capacity and an exceptional improvement of cycle life with a capacity retention of 97.7 % over 4400 cycles at 40 C. We also demonstrated the enhancement of co-intercalation on ion migration using a combined approach of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides an important progress to solve the cycle stability of Prussian blue analogues towards their practical application as electrode materials for aqueous batteries.

TI Concurrently Engineered Lewis Acid Sites and Coordination Sphere
   Vacancies in CoFe Prussian Blue Analogues for Boosted Bifunctional
   Oxygen Electrocatalysis
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), due to their high surface area, large density of catalytically active sites, and high porosity, are one of the potential bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for industrial applications. However, so far, only limited success has been achieved toward developing highly efficient PBA-based electrocatalysts. Therefore, unravelling the underlying structureproperty-activity relationship and designing strategies or combination of tested strategies are crucial to this effect. In this work, we demonstrate a strategy to concurrently engineer the coordination sphere vacancies and Lewis acid sites, via atomically dispersed Zn2+ dopants in CoFe PBA that makes Con+ more electropositive, to boost the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis on PBA surfaces. The optimal Zn-doping (3 mole %) not only enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of CoFe PBAs to the comparable level of the IrO2 catalyst but also depicts an impressive bifunctional oxygen activity with a low reversible overvoltage of 0.84 V. This work also demonstrates that an in situ formation of Co3+ (CoOOH) and Fe3+ (FeOOH) during the OER plays a crucial role for the boosted activity in bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. Besides providing highly efficient and low-cost catalysts, this study also imparts important insights to improve the efficiency of PBA-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis.

TI X-ray Photochemistry of Prussian Blue Cellulosic Materials: Evidence for
   a Substrate-Mediated Redox Process
SO LANGMUIR
AB Beside its promising applications in the design of multifunctional materials, batteries and biosensors, the pigment Prussian blue is still studied in heritage science because of its capricious fading behavior due to a complex light-induced redox mechanism. We studied model heritage materials composed of Prussian blue embedded into a cellulosic fiber substrate by means of X-ray absorption near-edge Spectroscopy. Significant X-ray radiation damage was observed and characterized. X-ray radiation induced first a reduction of Prussian blue, in a similar way to what Visible light does, followed by a complete degradation of the pigment and the formation of iron(III) oxyhydroxide. We took advantage of this X-ray photochemistry to investigate in depth the redox behavior of Prussian blue. We could particularly demonstrate that the rate, extent, and quality of Prussian blue photoreduction can be:tuned by modifying the pH and alkali cation content of the cellulosic substrate. The present study represents a Step further in the understanding of Prussian blue heritage materials from an electrochemical viewpoint and provides evidence of substrate-mediated photochemistry applicable to a wider class of Prussian blue composite materials.

TI Terahertz Wave Absorption of a Rubidium Manganese-Iron Prussian Blue
   Phase Transition Material
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Rubidium manganese hexacyanidoferrate, Rb0.97Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.99 & sdot; 0.5H2O, which has a three-dimensional cyanido-bridged Mn-Fe framework encapsulating Rb+ ions, shows a terahertz (THz) wave absorption property. This compound undergoes a charge-transfer phase transition between FeIII-CN-MnII [high temperature (HT) phase] and FeII-CN-MnIII [low temperature (LT) phase] near room temperature. The HT phase exhibits a THz wave absorption at 1.06 THz due to the slow vibration of the heavy Rb+ ions encapsulated in the three-dimensional framework. By contrast, the LT phase displays a higher resonance frequency at 1.13 THz. This shift to a higher frequency is attributed to the framework shrinkage, which decreases the space available for the trapped Rb+ ion. Indeed, the void volume accompanying the phase transition decreases by 16.4 % from 41.4 & Aring;3 (HT phase) to 34.6 & Aring;3 (LT phase). Tuning the THz wave absorption frequency is necessary for THz devices such as absorbers, switches, filters, and modulators, especially for THz technology with THz waves in the sub-THz region or near 1 THz.

SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Straightforward access to a new cyanide-bridged {Fe4Co4} "molecular box" containing a potassium ion, namely K subset of{[Fe-II(Tp)(CN)(3)](4)[Co-III((pz)Tp)](3)[Co-II((pz)Tp)]} (1) ( with Tp and (pz)Tp = tris- and tetrakis( pyrazolyl) borate, respectively), is provided, alongside its full characterisation. A detailed analysis of the molecular structure (X-ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy) and electronic properties (EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry) reveals that 1 shows slow magnetic relaxation and a remarkable photomagnetic effect at low temperature which is reminiscent of some FeCo Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs), and is ascribed to a photo-induced electron transfer. However, in contrast with these inorganic polymers, the overall neutral compound 1 is soluble and remarkably stable in organic solvents such as CH2Cl2. Moreover, 1 shows interesting redox versatility, with electrochemical experiments revealing the possible access to six stable redox states.

TI Mesoporous K-doped NiCo2O4 derived from a Prussian
   blue analog: high-yielding synthesis and assessment as oxygen evolution
   reaction catalyst
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The conversion and storage of clean renewable energy can be achieved using water splitting. However, water splitting exhibits sluggish kinetics because of the high overpotentials of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and should therefore be promoted by OER and/or HER electrocatalysts. As the kinetic barrier of the former reaction exceeds that of the latter, high-performance OER catalysts are highly sought after. Herein, K-doped NiCo2O4 (HK-NCO) was hydrothermally prepared from a Prussian blue analog with a metal-organic framework structure and assessed as an OER catalyst. Extensive K doping increased the number of active oxygen vacancies and changed their intrinsic properties (e.g., binding energy), thus increasing conductivity. As a result, HK-NCO exhibited a Tafel slope of 49.9 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming a commercial OER catalyst (Ir) and thus holding great promise as a component of high-performance electrode materials for metal-oxide batteries and supercapacitors.

TI Structural design of Prussian blue analogue derived CoSe2/FeSe2@C
   composites for high-performance all-solid-state flexible asymmetrical
   supercapacitors
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB Designing and manufacturing novel energy storage device electrode materials, particularly for supercapacitors, are of critical importance. Here, structure-adjustable porous bimetallic selenides (CoSe2/FeSe2) and carbon composites (CoSe2/FeSe2@C), derived from Co/Fe-Prussian Blue analogs, were successfully designed and fabricated as a high-performance positive electrode material. The results demonstrated the size and structure are crucial for electrochemical performance. Specially, the CoSe2/FeSe2@C-2 composite exhibits exceptional per-formance, with a specific capacitance of 1010 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and prolonged lifespan (maintains 95.5% of its initial capacity after 15,000 cycles at 5 A g-1). The all-solid-state flexible asymmetrical supercapacitors (CoSe2/ FeSe2@C-2//AC) were assembled with the positive electrode of CoSe2/FeSe2@C-2, which delivered a high en-ergy density (13.13 Wh kg-1), and exceptional cycling stability (91.17% of the initial capacity after 7000 cycles at 2 A g-1). This work opens up an avenue to synthesize bimetallic selenides with different sizes and structures rationally and environmentally.

   CsM<SUP>II</SUP>[M<SUP>III</SUP>(CN)6]. The Quest for Spin on
   Cesium Ions by Use of <SUP>133</SUP>Cs MAS NMR Spectroscopy
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The Cs-133 magic-angle spinning NMR. spectra of the paramagnetic compounds CsMII[M-III(CN)(6)], M-II = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn; = Co, Fe, yield unusually large and temperature-dependent signal shifts (up to -950 ppm relative to CsCl at 298 K). Comparison with the spectra of the diamagnetic analogues CsM[Co(CN)(6)], M = Zn, Cd, shows that the shifts are largely due to the unpaired electrons. This is ascribed to through-bond transfer of spin to the Cs+ ions, while the through-space effect of the magnetic moments on the signal shifts is shown to be virtually negligible. The mechanism inducing negative spin at Cs+ is discussed. The magnitude of the spin density (average: vertical bar 5.8 X 10(-3)vertical bar (a.u.) (-3)) suggests that Cs+ is involved in magnetic exchange interactions of corresponding Prussian blue derivatives.

TI Controlled synthesis and enhanced electrochemical performance of
   Prussian blue analogue-derived hollow FeCo2O4
   nanospheres as lithium-ion battery anodes
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Porous metal oxides have attracted great interest as anode materials for lithium ion batteries owing to their improved electrochemical properties. In this study, we propose a Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived strategy to successfully prepare hollow porous FexCo(3-x)O(4) (FCO) with controlled morphologies (nanospheres and nanocubes) using surfactants as "soft templates". In comparison with FCO nanocubes (FCO-NCs) and FCO nanoparticles (FCO-NPs), FCO spheres (FCO-NSs) show a much better cycling stability and rate capability as an anode material for lithium ion batteries. The cycling capacity of FCO-NSs at the 50th cycle has been largely enhanced to 1060 mA h g(-1) from only 721 (FCO-NCs) and 389 mA h g(-1) (FCO-NPs). The capacity of FCO-NSs at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1) has been considerably improved to 823 mA h g(-1) from 504 and 152 mA h g(-1) for FCO-NCs and FCO-NPs, respectively, indicating a much better rate capability. The greatly enhanced cycling stability and rate capability can be largely attributed to the hollow porous structure of FCO-NSs with a wider pore distribution, a slightly higher Co content (compared to FCO-NCs) and higher mechanical strength, which facilitates Li+ and electron diffusion and migration.

TI Scalable Printing of Prussian Blue Analogue@Au Edge-Rich Microcubes as
   Flexible Biosensing Microchips Performing Ultrasensitive Sucrose
   Fermentation Monitoring
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Sucrose is one of the most applied carbon sources in the fermentation process, and it directly determines the microbial metabolism with its concentration fluctuation. Meanwhile, sucrose also plays a key role of a protective agent in the production of biological vaccines, especially in the new mRNA vaccines for curing COVID-19. However, rapid and precise detection of sucrose is always desired but unrealized in industrial fermentation and synthetic biology research. In order to address the above issue, we proposed an ultrasensitive biosensor microchip achieving accurate sucrose recognition within only 12 s, relying on the construction of a Prussian blue analogue(a)Au edge-rich (PBA@AuER) microarchitecture. This special geometric structure was formed through exactly inducing the oriented PBA crystallization toward a certain plane to create more regular and continuous edge features. This composite was further transformed to a screen-printed ink to directly and large-scale fabricate an enzymatic biosensor microchip showing ultrahigh sensitivity, a wide detection range, and a low detection limit to the accurate sucrose recognition. As confirmed in a real alcohol fermentation reaction, the as-prepared microchip enabled us to accurately detect the sucrose and glucose concentrations with outstanding reusability (more than 300 times) during the whole process through proposing a novel analytical strategy for the binary mixture substrate system.

TI Uniform Virus-Like Co-N-Cs Electrocatalyst Derived from Prussian Blue
   Analog for Stretchable Fiber-Shaped Zn-Air Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Zn-air batteries (ZABs) offer promising commercialization perspectives for stretchable and wearable electronic devices as they are environment-friendly and have high theoretical energy density. However, current devices suffer from limited energy efficiency and durability because of the sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions kinetics in the air cathode as well as degenerative stretchability of solid-state electrolytes under highly alkaline conditions. Herein, excellent bifunctional catalytic activity and cycling stability is achieved by using a newly developed Co-N-C nanomaterial with a uniform virus-like structure, prepared via a facile carbonization of a prussian blue analogue (PBA). Furthermore, a solid-state dual-network sodium polyacrylate and cellulose (PANa-cellulose) based hydrogel electrolyte is synthesized with good alkaline-tolerant stretchability. A solid-state fiber-shaped ZAB fabricated using this hydrogel electrolyte, the virus-like Co-N-Cs air cathode, and a zinc spring anode display excellent stretchability of up to 500% strain without damage, and outstanding electrochemical performance with 128 mW cm(-2) peak power density and good cycling stability for >600 cycles at 2 mA. The facile synthesis strategy demonstrated here opens up a new avenue for developing highly active PBA-derived catalyst and shows, for the first time, that virus-like structure can be favorable for electrochemical performance.

TI Analysis of Heat Generation and Impedance Characteristics of Prussian
   Blue Analogue Cathode-based 18650-type Sodium-ion Cells
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB We report here 18650-type sodium-ion battery (NIB) with Prussian Blue Analogue Na2Fe2(CN)(6)in both monoclinic and rhombohedral phases as the cathode and hard carbon (HC) as the anode using the glyme-based non-flammable 1 mol dm(-3)NaBF(4)electrolyte. Rhombohedral-Na2Fe2(CN)(6)(RPB) vs HC 18650-type cell delivered an energy density of 43 Wh kg(-1), achieving good high rate response up to 4.0 C, stable cycling over 100 cycles with 99.99% average coulombic efficiency and 94.8% average round-trip-energy-efficiency. A comparison of the calorimetric studies performed on 18650-type cells revealed lower heat generation in RPB vs HC compared to monoclinic-Na2Fe2(CN)(6).2H(2)O (MPB) vs HC counterpart. Moreover, the RPB vs HC cell demonstrated lower heat generation than commercial NMC vs graphite 18650-type lithium-ion cells. Internal resistance, which is the major contributor to heat generation, is assessed by analysing the impedance spectra of the cells. Furthermore, variation in subcomponents of internal resistance across different depths of discharge determined by fitting impedance data using an equivalent circuit model and analysis using distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method is presented for 18650-type sodium-ion cells for the first time. The obtained results indicate that these efficient and safe 18650-type NIBs open-up new opportunities for exploring innovative storage systems for stationary applications.

TI Operando Spectroscopic Identification of Active Sites in NiFe Prussian
   Blue Analogues as Electrocatalysts: Activation of Oxygen Atoms for
   Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Developing highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts and understanding their activity are pivotal for electrochemical conversion technologies. Here, we report NiFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a promising electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline conditions. This material has an impressively low overpotential of 258 mV that reaches a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Post-mortem characterization showed that the as-prepared catalyst is entirely transformed into amorphous nickel hydroxide after the electrochemical treatment, and Ni(OH)(2) acts as the active species. Operando X-ray spectroscopic studies further found that this in situ generated Ni(OH)(2) displays an unique feature that allows deprotonation under applied potential creating NiOOH2-x that contains Ni4+ ions. The deprotonation reaction is reversible and potential-dependent, i.e., the amount of Ni4+ increases with increasing applied potential. Theoretical calculations were used to show that the role of Ni4+ is to trigger oxidized oxygen ions as electrophilic centers with the subsequent activation of anion redox reactions for OER.

SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Constructing three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructures has been considered one of the most effective strategies to improve electrode material performance for electrochemical energy storage. Herein, titanium hexacyanoferrate hierarchical nanoflowers (TiHCF HNFs) assembled by TiHCF nanosheets have been synthesized through a facile one-step coprecipitation approach. As a cathode material of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs), TiHCF HNFs exhibit an operating voltage of 1.72 V and a reversible capacity of 67.8 mAh g(-1). Impressively, TiHCF HNFs deliver a specific capacity of 47.0 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with a retention rate of 70.6% under 200 mA g(-1). This work may inspire the synthesis of Prussian blue analogue nanosheets and provide an understanding on the evolution of the TiHCF cathode for AZIBs.

TI A biomineralized Prussian blue nanotherapeutic for enhanced cancer
   photothermal therapy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
AB Photothermal therapy is a promising tumor ablation technique that converts light into heat energy to kill cancer cells. Prussian blue (PB), a biocompatible photothermal reagent, has been widely explored for cancer treatment. However, the translational potential of PB is severely hampered by its low photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) and poor stability. To tackle these issues, we adopted the biomineralization modality where PB was integrated with calcium phosphate (CaP) through the binding between calcium ions and PB. The mineralized PB (CaP&PB) demonstrated significantly improved PCE (40.2%), resulting from a calcium-induced bandgap-narrowing effect, and exhibited superior suspension stability. Using a 4T1 orthotopic breast cancer BALB/c mouse model, we observed that mineralized PB showed a significant temperature increase within the tumor, which led to better tumoricidal activity compared with CaP and PB when identical NIR treatment was applied. These achievements demonstrated the success of introducing calcium phosphate into Prussian blue by biomineralization to improve the PCE and stability of photothermal reagents, suggesting an alternative translational strategy for enhanced cancer photothermal therapy.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Hydrogen production from electrolytic water is considered as an effective strategy for the preparation of clean energy. Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a decisive step for electrolytic water process due to its slow kinetics and excessively high energy barrier. In this work, Prussian blue analogue (PBA) was chosen as a sacrificial template to effectively improve the growth environment of NiFe-based electrocatalysts and V-doped NiSe, FeSe, Fe-4 center dot 4Ni(17)center dot 6Se(16) (FNSe) hybrid electrodes were synthesized using a simple in-situ immersion then multi-step hydrothermal method on a conductive substrate nickel foam (NF). V-NiSe/FeSe/FNSe/NF exhibited a unique nanomicrospheres surface-loaded nanoparticles in a unique morphology. Abundant crystal surface defects and heterojunctions can provide the advantages of a large number of active sites and accelerated electron transfer, which also can lead to the enhancement of catalytic activity, OER (overpotential of 181 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and UOR (potential of 1.31 V@10 mA cm(-2)). This study provides new ideas for the exploration of transition metal selenide electrocatalysts for electrolytic water.

TI Regulating pyrolysis strategy to construct CNTs-linked porous cubic
   Prussian blue analogue derivatives for lightweight and broadband
   microwave absorption
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Metal-organic framework (MOFs) derived carbon-based nanocomposites are considered as a class of new microwave absorption materials with great application potential. However, it remains a challenge to obtain high efficiency absorbers based on MOFs with lower filling ratio and wider effective absorption band. In addition, it is difficult to construct uniform interconnection networks of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in situ on the surface of MOFs derivatives by simple method. Here, we innovatively combined the pyrolysis laws of Co-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with the mechanisms of CNTs synthesis catalyzed by Co nanoparticles, and prepared CNTslinked cubic porous PBA derivative (CoCN@CNT) through a designed pyrolysis process. Results show that when a temperature plateau was added and the final pyrolysis temperature was controlled to 700 celcius, the obtained sample has a unique morphology and the best microwave absorption performance. When the filling ratio is only 20%, it could exhibit an ultra-wideband effective absorption of 6.35 GHz with a matching thickness of 2.5 mm, covering the entire Ku radar band. This work provides theoretical support for the controllable growth of metal catalyzed CNTs, as well as novel insights for the design and facile synthesis of high-performance micro-nano scale microwave absorbers.

TI Reasonable design of PBA-derived interfacial modified ternary compounds
   and hollow structure materials in high-performance asymmetric
   supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBA), common metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are typically binary metal compounds. In this study, chromium was incorporated during the preparation of nickel-cobalt PBA, resulting in the adjustment of the micro-morphology of PBA and the synthesis of small-sized PBA (sPBA) electrode materials with diameters ranging from 20 to 30 nm. These materials underwent various interfacial modifications to yield ternary metal phosphide (sPBA-P) and hollow nanostructures (sPBA-C). Additionally, by integrating graphene oxide (GO) as the growth substrate, successful preparation of GO@sPBA-P and GO@sPBA-C electrode materials was achieved. Significantly, these materials showcase outstanding electrochemical properties and interesting interfacial reactions when employed as cathode and anode components. Through a comprehensive series of characterization analyses, the electrochemical properties and reaction mechanisms of these materials were thoroughly investigated. Ultimately, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled using the synthesized GO@sPBA-P and GO@sPBA-C to explore the material's potential in energy materials applications.

TI Self-induced cobalt-derived hollow structure Prussian blue as a cathode
   for sodium-ion batteries
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB As advanced electrode materials for sodium ion batteries, Prussian blue and its derivatives have attracted considerable attention due to their low cost, structural stability and facile synthesis process. However, the application of commercially available Prussian blue is limited by its poor electronic conductivity as well as the structural defect induced by crystalline/interstitial water molecules. Herein, to address these drawbacks, an etching-agent free method is developed to synthesize Prussian blue with a hollow structure, and the synthesis mechanism is revealed. Owing to the stability of divalent iron ions, the shorter electron/ion diffusion pathway and fewer defect sites of the hollow structure, the obtained Prussian blue exhibits excellent electrochemical performance (specific capacity of 133.6 mA h g(-1) at 1C, 1C = 170 mA g(-1)), which can put forward a new avenue to engineer advanced electrode materials for sodium ion batteries.

TI Theoretical study of ultrafast spin dynamics in a Co-Fe molecular
   Prussian blue analog and spin logic functionality design
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Co-Fe Prussian blue analog (PBA) complex possesses various spin configurations and discrete energy levels with different types of spin localizations, making it suitable for the exploration of spin manipulation and logic functionality towards the molecular spintronics applications. In this paper, we perform an ab initio investigation on the electronic structure, spin localization, ultrafast optical-driven spin dynamics, and the possible spin logic functionality of this structure. The results show that within the calculated energy window of the many-body electronic states, spin-crossover and spin-transfer scenarios, driven by specific well-tailored laser, can be both achieved reversibly in subpicoseconds with high fidelities. Among them, a multifunctional dynamical process that simultaneously includes spin transfer, spin-crossover, and charge transfer is found. In addition, the potential of applying the same laser to drive different kinds of spin dynamics is indicated. Towards the device applications, the Pauli and Hadamard quantum logic gates and the half-adder functionality are further elaborately constructed based on the achieved spin scenarios. Our results suggest the present structure is quite promising in novel highperformance single-molecular devices and advanced spin logic processing from the viewpoints of both scientific research and technological applications, and thus propel the development of future molecular spintronic devices and quantum information technology.

TI Gel-State Dependencies of Brown Patterns of Mn-Fe-Based Prussian Blue
   Analogues Studied by Combined X-ray Spectroscopies
SO BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB The gel-state dependencies of brown patterns of MnFe- based Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) formed in waterglass gels by reaction-diffusion (RD) processes have been studied by using X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopies. Three tubes containing admixtures of 0.25M [Fe(CN)(6)](3)(-) and 0.30M acetic acid (A and B) or boric acid (C) in water-glass (9.1 (A) and 7.4 (B and C) mass%) were brought into contact with 0.20M MnSO4 solution. Tube A formed periodic (but not genuine Liesegang) bands, whereas tubes B and C formed light-brown bands in the turbid zone (TZ). A lowered amount of water-glass (A -> B) resulted in a more fluctuant distribution of the PBAs. [Mn(H2O)(6)](2+) ions were also present in the TZ of tube B and their content increased with distance from the gel-junction after stopping the RD process. Addition of boric acid (C) suppressed the RD processes in the gel, slowing down the formation of PBAs. It is likely that the areas of low PBA content in the TZ of tubes B and C generate the light-brown bands. FEFF calculations suggest that the most likely local structures of the predominant PBAs in tubes A/B and C are Mn(NCFe)(2)O4K2 and Mn(NCFe)(2)O-4, respectively.

TI Chemical-physical synergistic etching enabling deep reconstruction of
   NiFe Prussian blue analogue for efficient oxygen evolution reaction and
   Zn-air batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising pre-catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the in situ reconstructed metal oxyhydroxides during OER are regarded as the real active sites. However, most of the reported PBAs only undergo surface reconstruction and the PBAs cannot be fully converted to active species, resulting in unsatisfactory activity. In this work, taking NiFe PBA nanocubes as an example, a chemical-physical synergistic etching strategy is developed to enable the deep reconstruction of NiFe PBA nanocubes, thus promoting the OER activity. After etching, the NiFe PBA nanocubes are converted to NiFe PBA nanoboxes with hollow structure and dual vacancies (Ni vacancy and CN vacancy), facilitating the deep reconstruction of NiFe PBAs to NiOOH/FeOOH nanoboxes. Benefiting from the structural and compositional merits, the NiOOH/FeOOH nanoboxes exhibit a low overpotential of 216 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air battery based on NiOOH/FeOOH nanoboxes delivers high peak power density (185 mW cm(-2)) and superb cycling stability (over 2000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2)), outperforming the commercial RuO2.

TI Highly catalytic CoFe-prussian blue analogue/ZIF-67 yolk-shell
   nanocube-decorated MBene nanosheets for ultrasensitive electrochemical
   cancer-specific neoantigen biosensor
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Neoantigens exclusively presented by human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on cancer cell surfaces are newly discovered and highly cancer-specific biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. The current available method for detecting neoantigens is predominantly based on Mass spectrometry with inevitable limitations of high cost, complexity and isotope labels. In this work, we describe the development of an innovative catalytic electrochemical biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of neoantigen in cell lysates. Such biosensor design involves the synthesis of new and highly catalytic CoFe-prussian blue analogue/ZIF-67 yolk-shell nanocube-decorated MBene nanosheets (CoFe-PBA/ZIF-67/MBene) and the derivatization of electrochemically inert neoantigen to electroactive molecule. The as synthesized CoFe-PBA/ZIF-67/MBene nanocomposite exhibits large specific surface area, excellent conductivity and abundant active sites for electrochemical oxidation of the derivatized neoantigens for the yield of considerably amplified currents for sensitive detection of target neoantigen with low to 0.047 nM detection limit. The biosensor can also be applied for monitoring low levels of HLA-presented neoantigen complexes in cell lysates, offering new insights into methodological advancements in neoantigen analyses for cancer research.

TI Plasma-Induced Oxygen Vacancies in N-Doped Hollow NiCoPBA Nanocages
   Derived from Prussian Blue Analogue for Efficient OER in Alkaline Media
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Although water splitting is a promising method to produce clean hydrogen energy, it requires efficient and low-cost catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study focused on plasma treatment's significance of surface oxygen vacancies in improving OER electrocatalytic activity. For this, we directly grew hollow NiCoPBA nanocages using a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) on nickel foam (NF). The material was treated with N plasma, followed by a thermal reduction process for inducing oxygen vacancies and N doping on the structure of NiCoPBA. These oxygen defects were found to play an essential role as a catalyst center for the OER in enhancing the charge transfer efficiency of NiCoPBA. The N-doped hollow NiCoPBA/NF showed excellent OER performance in an alkaline medium, with a low overpotential of 289 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high stability for 24 h. The catalyst also outperformed a commercial RuO2 (350 mV). We believe that using plasma-induced oxygen vacancies with simultaneous N doping will provide a novel insight into the design of low-priced NiCoPBA electrocatalysts.

TI Interface Reinforcement of a Prussian Blue Cathode Using a Non-Flammable
   Co-Solvent Cresyl Diphenyl Phosphate for a High-Safety Na-Ion Battery
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB A Prussian blue (PB)-based sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a promising candidate in large-scale electric energy storage. However, its development is hindered by the poor cyclability of the PB cathode and safety problems with a flammable electrolyte. Herein, a non-flammable co-solvent cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP) in the electrolyte is proposed to increase the safety associated with PB-based SIBs, due to its effective flame retardancy for the electrolyte and good compatibility with the Na anode. Moreover, the deteriorated electrochemical performance of PB is obviously suppressed with cathode interface reinforcement after using CDP, resulting in excellent cyclability with a capacity retention of 83.1% after 700 cycles. The capacity fading of PB can be effectively suppressed with a protective film of phosphates produced by CDP decomposition, forming FePO4, which can activate low-spin Fe-ion sites in the PB lattice. This work effectively improves the battery safety and interface stability between the PB cathode and the electrolyte using the non-flammable CDP co-solvent, as well as the clarification of a capacity fading mechanism for general PB with considerable Fe(CN)(6) vacancies and crystal water.

The electrocatalytical properties of the films were also evaluated and the rate constants for thiosulfate oxidation were obtained and discussed.

TI Prussian White Hierarchical Nanotubes with Surface-Controlled Charge
   Storage for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Coordination compounds such as Prussian blue and its analogues are acknowledged as promising candidates for electrochemical sodium storage owing to their tailorable and open frameworks. However, a key challenge for these electrode materials is the trade-off between energy and power. Here, it is demonstrate that Prussian white (Na3.1Fe4[Fe(CN)(6)](3)) hierarchical nanotubes with fully open configurations render extrinsic Na+ intercalation pseudocapacitance. The cathode exhibits a capacity up to 83 mA h g(-1) at an ultrahigh rate of 50 C and an unprecedented cycle life over 10 000 times for sodium storage. In situ Raman spectroscopy together with in situ X-ray diffraction analysis reveal that intercalation pseudocapacitance enables full reaction of N-Fe-III/Fe-II sites in Prussian white with a negligible volume expansion (<2.1%). The discovery of surface-controlled charge storage occurring inside the entire bulk of intercalation cathodes paves a new way for developing high power, high energy, and long life-span sodium-ion batteries.

TI Evaluating the impact of anodic oxidation reactions on water splitting
   using Prussian blue analog-derived metal-(oxy)hydroxides
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Herein, we have evaluated the performance of Prussian blue analog (PBA)-derived Fe-Co(O)OH for the anodic oxidation of a series of organic and inorganic compounds (substituted benzyl alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, substituted benzyl amines, phenol, urea, and hydrazine). The effect of different anodic oxidation reactions (AORs) on the production of cathodic H-2, generation of value-added products, and requirement of potential for the electrochemical process has been considered. Special attention has been provided to achieve an industrial-scale current density for AORs avoiding the interference from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and produce value-added chemicals with a faradaic efficiency (FE) > 90%. Fe-Co(O)OH achieved industrial-scale current density for all AORs without any interference from the OER. Among all the AORs, hydrazine oxidation was found to be suitable in terms of required potential and hydrogen production while the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) and benzyl amine (BAm) led to the most promising performance for value-added product formation. The anodic BA (BAm) oxidation achieved 400 mA cm(-2) current density at 1.47 V (1.49 V) vs. RHE with 100% selectivity for benzoic acid (FE = 98.3 +/- 1.1%) and cyanobenzene (FE = 97.5 +/- 1.2%). Moreover, the replacement of the OER with AORs improved the H-2 evolution efficiency significantly. The XAS study also showed the modulated electronic and atomic structure of the electrocatalyst after AORs.

TI Rational Direct Synthesis of RbMnFe Nanoparticles (RbMnFe =
   RbxMn[Fe(CN)6](2+x)/3•
   nH2O Prussian Blue Analogue)
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB In this paper, we report the chemical strategy followed to obtain, in a direct way, nanoparticles of the RbxMn[Fe(CN)(6)]((x+2)/3)center dot nH(2)O (RbMnFe) Prussian blue analogue with the aim of keeping the switching ability of this compound at the nanoscale. The switching properties come from a reversible electron transfer between the iron and manganese ions and depends on the rubidium content in the structure that has to be higher than 0.6. Despite the multifunctionality of this family of compounds and its interest in various applications, no systematic studies were performed to obtain well-defined nanoparticles. This paper relates to such an investigation. To draw relationship between size reduction, composition, and switching properties, a special attention was brought to the determination of the composition through elemental analysis and structure refinement of powder X-ray diffraction patterns together with infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Several chemical parameters were explored to control both the size reduction and the composition following a direct synthetic approach. The results show that the smaller the particles, the lower the rubidium content. This observation might prevent the observation of switching properties on very small particles. Despite this antagonist effect, we achieved switchable particles of around 200 nm without any use of surfactant. Moreover, the size reduction is associated with the observation of the electron transfer down to 52% of rubidium in the nanoparticles against 64% in microparticles. This work is of particular interest in processing such nanoparticles into devices.

TI Nafion-coated Prussian blue electrodes to enhance the stability and
   efficiency of battery desalination system
SO DESALINATION
AB Battery desalination (BD) is a promising next-generation desalination technology because it is environmentally benign, consumes little energy, and requires only mild operating conditions. However, the BD capacity decreases with long-term operation, which limits its use. Herein, we report a new approach to improve the BD cycling stability by coating battery electrodes with Nafion. Nafion-coated electrodes (NaNiHCF and NaFeHCF) were used with rocking chair desalination, a BD system that pairs two cation-reactive battery electrodes with an anion exchange membrane. The system maintained 94% retention capacity and approximately 100% Coulombic efficiency after 100 cycles. Moreover, the overall desalination performance was enhanced, achieving high desalination capacity (approx. 72 mg g(-1)) and lower specific energy consumption (5.6 kJ mole(-1)). In this study, we describe an effective strategy to improve the overall desalination performance and cycling stability of BD.

TI Prussian blue analogue-derived
   Co3O4/Fe2O3 with a partially
   hollow and octahedral structure for high-performance supercapacitors
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB A supercapacitor (SC) is considered as a promising energy storage device because of its high power density, fast charging/discharging speed and long cycle life. The transition metal oxides prepared by traditional methods face some challenges, such as low conductivity and uncontrollable pore size distribution. Therefore, we have prepared Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) using a coprecipitation method. By adjusting additives in the experimental process, uniform PBAs with a series of regular morphologies and structures are successfully prepared. Then the corresponding metal oxides are obtained by calcining precursors. We systematically study the influence of the morphology and structure of metal oxides Co3O4/ Fe2O3 derived from PBAs on their electrochemical performance. The metal oxide with a partially hollow and octahedral structure shows excellent electrochemical performance. In a neutral electrolyte, the specific capacitance is 659.7 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. After 6000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate is 63.7%. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is constructed using Co3O4/Fe2O3 with an octahedral structure (CFMO-PVP-2) as the positive electrode and YP-50F as the negative electrode. The maximum energy density is 31.4 W h kg-1 at a power density of 1921 W kg-1. The maximum power density is 8421 W kg-1 at an energy density of 23.5 W h kg-1. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the low resistance (Rw and Rct) and high DOH- derived from the oxide particles on the surface and within the inner parts of the octahedron, which are available for electron transport. Meanwhile, the open void between adjacent nanoparticles allows the electrolyte ions to diffuse more efficiently and ensures a much more effective area for participating in a reaction. The strategy will give new insights into designing high-performance SCs based on PBAs.

TI Electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction promoted by cobalt-Prussian
   blue and its thermal decomposition product under mild conditions
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Cobalt-Prussian blue analogues are remarkable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (water oxidation) under mild conditions such as neutral pH. Although there are extensive reports in the literature about the application of these catalysts in water oxidation (the limiting step for hydrogen evolution), some limitations must be overcome in terms of improving the turnover frequency, oxygen production, long term stability, and elucidation of the mechanism. Another important feature to consider is the industrial processability of electrolytic cells for water splitting. For these reasons, we have reported herein a comparison of the electrochemical and chemical properties of three catalysts produced from cobalt-Prussian blue. Co-Co PBA 60 refers to cobalt-Prussian blue heated up to 60 degrees C with a high content of water. Co-Co PBA 200 is the same starting material but heated up to 200 degrees C with a low water content. Finally, Co3O4 is a thermal decomposition product obtained from heating cobalt-Prussian blue up to 400 degrees C. Although Co-Co PBA 60 has a higher overpotential for water oxidation than Co-Co PBA 200, this catalyst is kinetically faster than Co PBA 200. It is suggested that the water coordinated to Co2+ in Co-Co PBA 60 can accelerate the reaction and that there is a balance between the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics for determining the final properties of the catalyst at pH = 7. Another important observation is that the Co3O4 catalyst has the best performance among the considered catalysts with the highest TON and TOF. This suggests that the different mechanisms and surface effects demonstrated by the Co3O4 catalyst are more conducive to efficient water oxidation than those of Prussian blue. Further studies concerning the effect of water and surface on these catalysts under mild conditions are essential to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of water oxidation and to advance the development of new catalysts.

TI Etched Co-Fe Prussian blue analog nanozymes with superior peroxidase
   activity for colorimetric biosensing of hydrogen peroxide and dopamine
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Nanozymes represent a compelling alternative to natural enzymes due to their exceptional stability and cost efficiency in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this work, a nanozyme etched Co-Fe Prussian blue analog (etched PBA) was designed and fabricated by a simple approach involving first synthesizing Co-Fe PBA and then chemical etching. The fabricated etched PBA acts as a peroxidase mimic catalyst. Compared to the naturally occurring enzyme (horseradish peroxidase), the etched PBA exhibited improved peroxidase-like catalytic efficiency for oxidizing 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbnmenzidine (TMB). Particularly, the exceptional peroxidaselike activity of the etched PBA is attributed to modifications in its electronic and structural properties, which improved affinity for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and TMB. Hence, these findings highlight etched PBA as promising peroxidase mimic, enabling a colorimetric assay for real-time H2O2 and dopamine (DA) detection. H2O2 was detected via PBA-catalyzed TMB oxidation (bluish-green color), while DA monitoring occurred through ox-TMB reduction. The detection thresholds for H2O2 and DA were determined to be 0.083 mu M and 0.05 mu M, respectively, with broad linear ranges of 0.1 mu M- 4.0 mM for H2O2 and 0.1-240 mu M for DA. In addition, the etched PBA was validated for real sample analysis, showing potential for enzyme catalysis, biosensing, and colorimetric analysis of pharmaceuticals and biomolecules.

TI Indicator/catalyst displacement assay: design of a latent catalyst for
   the selective detection and degradation of cyanide by Prussian blue
   analog-modified TiO2 nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Prussian blue bimetallic analog (PBA)-modified TiO2 particles (NP1-3) were explored as a new generation of latent catalytic materials for the simultaneous detection and removal of cyanide using the indicator/catalytic displacement approach (ICDA). These PBAs not only act as 'colored coats' but also quench the oxidative degradation properties of TiO2 by facilitating the recombination of its electrons and holes. The obtained results revealed that among common organic/inorganic pollutants (e.g., cyanide, aniline, 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid, benzoic acid, and 4-nitrophenol), only CN- could selectively induce a colorimetric response and the photocatalytic oxidative degradation of TiO2, while analytes bearing amine, sulfate, carboxylate, and phenol functionalities did not induce any response. These functional materials were also found to be applicable in real water bodies.

TI Novel targeted pH-responsive drug delivery systems based on
   PEGMA-modified bimetallic Prussian blue analogs for breast cancer
   chemotherapy
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The development of novel nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (nano-DDSs) with high loading capacity, low toxicity, precise targeting, and excellent biocompatibility remains urgent and important for the treatment of breast cancer (BC). Herein, novel BC-targeted nano-DDSs based on bimetallic Prussian blue analogs (PBA-DDSs) for intracellular doxorubicin (DOX) delivery and pH-responsive release were developed. Two kinds of bimetallic PBA, namely CuFe (copper-iron) PBA and CoFe (cobalt-iron) PBA, were synthesized by a coprecipitation method, followed by modification with polyethyleneglycol methacrylate (PEGMA) via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization and immobilization with the AS1411 aptamer to obtain two kinds of novel BC-targeted nano-DDS. CuFePBA@PEGMA@AS1411 and CoFePBA@PEGMA@AS1411 showed high drug loading efficiency of 80% and 84%, respectively, for DOX, while 56.0% and 75.9% DOX release could be achieved under acidic pH conditions. In vitro cell viability and in vivo experiments proved the good biocompatibility of both PBA-DDSs. Cellular uptake and in vivo distribution suggested that both PBA-DDSs had efficient nucleolin-targeting capability, indicating the targeted delivery of DOX in tumor tissues. In vivo evaluation of anti-BC efficacy further confirmed that the obtained PBA-DDSs exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy with limited side-effects. Therefore, the proposed novel PBA-DDSs can be used as secure and effective drug nano-DDSs for BC chemotherapy.

TI Iron-modulated Ni3S2 derived from a Ni-MOF-based
   Prussian blue analogue for a highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Developing efficient, environmentally friendly and cost-effective non-precious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to alleviate the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Herein, we report a simple and practical method to prepare non-precious metal catalysts, namely iron-modulated Ni3S2 (Fe-Ni3S2/NF) on nickel foam, by growing a Ni-MOF directly on 3D porous conductive nickel foam, followed by the formation of Ni-MOF-based Prussian blue analogs (Ni-MOF@PBA) via in situ cation exchange reactions, which are further sulfidated to iron-modulated Ni3S2. Based on a series of characterization results, it is confirmed that iron acts as a modulator at the Ni active site, leading to electron depletion, thereby modulating the electron spin state and optimizing the binding energy of key reaction intermediates, resulting in highly exposed active sites and acceleration of OER reaction kinetics. The synthesized Fe-Ni3S2/NF exhibits excellent activity in alkaline media, which needs overpotentials of only 232 mV and 287 mV to drive current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. Additionally, Fe-Ni3S2/NF exhibits excellent stability for at least 24 h during the OER process. This work presents a rational design and synthesis of transition metal-based catalysts with nanocone structures, providing a new strategy for assembling advanced materials and insights for exploring various energy storage and conversion systems.

TI Electrochromogenic Detection of Live Bacteria Using Soluble and
   Insoluble Prussian Blue
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Microbial detection is crucial for the control and prevention of infectious diseases, being one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Among the techniques developed for bacterial detection, those based on metabolic indicators are progressively gaining interest due to their simplicity, adaptability, and, most importantly, their capacity to differentiate between live and dead bacteria. Prussian blue (PB) may act as a metabolic indicator, being reduced by bacterial metabolism, producing a visible color change from blue to colorless. This molecule can be present in two main forms, namely, the soluble and the insoluble, having different properties and structures. In the current work, the bacterial-sensing capacity of soluble and insoluble PB will be tested and compared both in suspensions as PB-NPs and after deposition on transparent indium tin oxidepoly(ethylene terephthalate) (ITO-PET) electrodes. In the presence of live bacteria, PB-NPs are metabolized and completely reduced to the Prussian white state in less than 10 h for soluble and insoluble forms. However, when electrodeposited on ITO-PET substrates, less than 1 h of incubation with bacteria is required for both forms, although the soluble one presents faster metabolic reduction kinetics. This study paves the way to the use of Prussian blue as a metabolic indicator for the early detection of bacterial infection in fields like microbial diagnostics, surface sterilization, food and beverage contamination, and environmental pollution, among others.

TI Heterostructures of NiFe-MOF/PBAs with high-performance supercapacitors
   obtained by compounding Prussian blue analogues on bimetallic organic
   frames
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Metal organic framework (MOF) is considered as an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors due to its low cost and homogeneous nanostructure, but the drawbacks of single MOF, such as low specific capacity and stability, limit its development, so the design of bimetallic MOF structural composites is a challenging but favourable strategy for the development of supercapacitors. In this paper, NiFe-MOF/PBAs heterostructure, a bimetallic MOF material with a granular rod-like structure, is successfully prepared by using bimetallic MOF as a precursor and introducing [Co(CN)6]3-ions to further convert it into PBAs (Prussian blue analogs). Due to the special macroporous structure of PBAs, the composite combines the advantages of the two MOF materials, and the specific capacity is as high as 4270.19 C g-1 at 1 A g-1. The composite still has excellent electrochemical properties when assembled into devices. The specific capacity is 1996.01 C g-1 at 1 A g-1, the energy density reached 749.99 W h kg-1 at a power density of 415.85 W kg-1, and the decay rate is only 1.14 % after 20,000 cycles at 10 A g-1. These results indicate that the designed dual MOFs composite electrodes have good application prospects in the field of electrochemical energy storage.

TI High-Performance Fe-Based Prussian Blue Cathode Material for Enhancing
   the Activity of Low-Spin Fe by Cu Doping
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Iron-based Prussian blue (FeHCF) has great application potential in the large-scale production of sodium-ion (Na+) batteries because of its high theoretical capacity and abundant Fe ore resources. However, the Fe(CN)(6) vacancies and crystal water seriously affect the electrochemical performance. Herein, a Cu-doped FeHCF (Cu-FeHCF) cathode material is successfully prepared directly by a coprecipitation method. After Cu doping, the monoclinic structure and the quasi-cubic morphology are retained, but the electrochemical performance is significantly improved. In addition to few Fe(CN)(6) vacancies and low crystal water, the improved performance is also related to the enhanced electrochemical activity of low-spin Fe and the stabilizing effect of Cu on the crystal structure. Moreover, Cu doping also controls the side reaction to a certain extent. As a result, after Cu doping, the initial discharge capacity is enhanced from 107.9 to 127.4 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), especially the capacities contributed by low-spin Fe increase from 30.0, 21.7, and 16.7 mA h g(-1) to 48.8, 45.4, and 43.7 mA h g(-1) for the first three cycles, respectively. Even at 2 A g(-1), Cu-FeHCF still has a promising initial capacity of 82.3 mA h g(-1) and only a 0.047% capacity decay rate for each cycle over 500 cycles. Therefore, Cu-FeHCF shows excellent application potential in the field of Na+ energy storage batteries.

TI Evidence of the Core-Shell Structure of (Photo)magnetic CoFe Prussian
   Blue Analogue Nanoparticles and Peculiar Behavior of the Surface Species
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB We report on a comparative study of 5.5 nm (embedded in an ordered mesoporous silica matrix) and 100 nm (free) (photo)magnetic CoFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) particles. Co and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements point out a core-shell structure of the particles in their ground states. In the 5.5 nm particles, the 11.5 angstrom thick shell is made of Fe(CN)(6) entities and Co-II-NC-Fe-III linkages departing from the geometry usually encountered in PBA, whatever the oxidation state ((CoFeIII)-Fe-II or (CoFeII)-Fe-III) of the CoFe pairs in the core. In the photomagnetic particles, the photomagnetic effect in the core of the particles is due to the same photoinduced Co-III(LS)Fe-II -> Co-II(HS)Fe-III electron transfer whatever the size of the particles. The shell of the nanoparticles exhibits a peculiar photoinduced structural rearrangement, and the nanoparticles in their photoexcited state exhibit a superparamagnetic behavior.

TI Achieving a Zn-ion battery-capacitor hybrid energy storage device with a
   cycle life of more than 12,000 cycles
SO COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING
AB Prussian blue is considered as a promising zinc ion battery material because of its advantages such as stable structure, large lattice gap and simple preparation process. However, the poor conductivity seriously hinders the application of Prussian blue electrode materials. Herein we report a simple and interesting strategy to grow Prussian blue nanoparticle on expanded graphite electrode through a facile electrochemical method. Thanks to the synergy between Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles and self-supporting graphite flakes, the composite electrode with unique architectural structure possess both battery and capacitor characteristics. What's even more interesting is that the defects of Prussian blue crystals are gradually reduced during the extraction and insertion of zinc ions, and then the increasingly perfect crystal structure result in excellent cycling performance (120% capacitance retention after 12,000 cycles).

TI 1D magnetic nitrogen doped carbon-based fibers derived from NiFe
   Prussian blue analogues embedded polyacrylonitrile via electrospinning
   with tunable microwave absorption
SO COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING
AB Exploring excellent microwave absorbing materials (MAMs) to manage the electromagnetic (EM) radiation and interference is still a grand challenge nowadays. In this work, NiFe Prussian blue analogues (NiFe-PBA) embedded in polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is prepared by electrospinning, and the derived NiFe nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen doped carbon fibers (NiFe@NCFs) were synthesized followed a heat treatment process. Among the samples, the minimum reflection loss is -39.7 dB at 11.5 GHz with a small thickness of 2 mm and the broadest effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) is 4.6 GHz with a small thickness of only 1.45 mm. The excellent microwave absorption is attribute to the synergistic effect of suitable impedance matching and intrinsic strong attenuation capability. The quantity of NiFe-PBA embedded in PAN fiber-like precursors could effectively regulate the EM parameters of NiFe@NCFs by adjusting the conductivity and magnetic properties. It is believed that this work would opened up a way for designing novel light-weight, ultrathin-thickness, broadband, strong microwave attenuation capability of magnetic carbon-based MAMs.

TI A promising cathode material of sodium-iron nickel hexacyanoferrate for
   sodium ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Sodium ion batteries are attracting great attention due to the naturally alternative energy storage for large-scale applications. The reliable and high performance cathode materials are urgently needed for their practical applications. Here, we report sodium iron-nickel hexacyanoferrate (FeNiHCF) with Prussian blue structure by substitution of a portion of iron ions with nickel ions, and characterize it as cathode material of sodium ion battery for the first time. The low-spin Fe2+/Fe3+ couple in FeNiHCF is sufficiently activated for sodium storage, which leads to higher capacity contribution at larger potential and better stability on redox energy comparing with the single metal hexacyanoferrate of FeHCF or NiHCF. The FeNiHCF cathode presents synergistic advantages of high capacity, remarkable cycling stability, superior rate capability and good Coulombic efficiency. Significant improvement on electrochemical performance have been achieved with a discharge capacity of 106 mAh g(-1), a Coulombic efficiency of similar to 97% and excellent capacity retention of 96% over 100 cycles. Impressively, the FeNiHCF cathode present a good and stable cycling at high current densities, e.g. a capacity of 71 mAh g(-1) and 100% capacity retention at a current density as high as 500 mA g(-1). The intercalation chemistry manner for improving the sodium storage of material may shed light on improving the Na-storage performance of Prussian blue analogues. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI Engineering FeCo alloy@N-doped carbon layers by directly pyrolyzing
   Prussian blue analogue: new peroxidase mimetic for chemiluminescence
   glucose biosensing
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
AB Herein, we report the synthesis of FeCo alloy@N-doped carbon layers (FeCo@NC), a new peroxidase mimetic, by directly pyrolyzing the Fe-III-Co Prussian blue analogue (Fe-III-Co PBA). The FeCo@NC composite showed excellent peroxidase-like activity due to its highly active FeCo alloy, M-N species (Co-N and Fe-N) and N-doped carbon layers with hierarchical pore nanostructures, which were formed via simple heat treatment of Fe-III-Co PBA without additional C and N sources. In particular, the obtained FeCo@NC hybrid presented high CL activity with more than 85-fold enhancement in the CL emission of the H2O2-luminol system, and long-term stability compared with FeCo alloy nanoparticles. The CL response showed a linear range of 0.01-40 mu M H2O2 with a limit of detection of 2.5 nM. When coupled with glucose oxidase, we developed a new CL sensing method for the detection of glucose in the linear range of 10 nM to 10 mu M with a detection limit of 8.5 nM. This FeCo@NC-based glucose biosensor displayed rapidity, high precision and good reproducibility when utilized to analyze real biological samples. Expectedly, FeCo@NC, as a new peroxidase mimetic, exhibits great potential for monitoring glucose levels in clinical diagnosis.

TI A Prussian blue analog-based copper-aluminum layered double hydroxide
   for cesium removal from water: fabrication, density functional
   theory-based molecular modeling, and the adsorption mechanism
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB A new type of adsorbent, a Prussian blue analog-based copper-aluminum layered double hydroxide (PBA@CuAl-LDH), was successfully synthesized using a one-step method for the removal of radioactive Cs+ from wastewater. The adsorption performance, characteristics and the underlying adsorption mechanism of PBA@CuAl-LDH were systematically examined. The results showed that PBA@CuAl-LDH exhibited excellent adsorption performance, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 109.2 mg g-1. Over 85% of PBA@CuAl-LDH can be recycled, and the material exhibited only a 6.6% loss in adsorption performance. The adsorption process was well-fitted using the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model, revealing the surface heterogeneity of the composite adsorbent. A molecular model of PBA@CuAl-LDH was constructed by combining density functional theory and multiple instrumental characterization techniques. Our results indicate that PBA crystals can be generated between layers and on the surface. Ion exchange was revealed as the main adsorption mechanism of Cs+ by PBA@CuAl-LDH. Specifically, the interstitial spaces of the PBA crystals generated between the layers and on the surface played an important role in ion exchange. These findings provide concrete theoretical support for radioactive pollution control and have significant value in directing the fabrication of cesium removal materials and their future engineering application.

TI Hollow NiCoP Nanoprisms Derived from Prussian Blue Analogues as
   Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Production in
   Alkaline Media
SO SMALL
AB Integrating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an energy-saving approach for electrolytic H-2 production. Here, hollow NiCoP nanoprisms are derived from Prussian blue analogues by a combined self-template coordination reaction and gas-phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strong electron interaction, unique hollow nanostructure, and enhanced mass/charge transfer, NiCoP nanoprisms display outstanding alkaline HER and UOR performance. Specifically, low potentials of -0.052, -0.115, and -0.159 V for HER and ultralow potentials of 1.30, 1.36, and 1.42 V for UOR at current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) are obtained. Moreover, in a urea-assisted water electrolysis system, NiCoP nanoprisms only require cell voltages of 1.36, 1.49, and 1.57 V to offer current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), about 170, 180, and 200 mV less than the traditional water electrolysis. Theoretical calculations indicate the Co substitution in Ni2P promotes the adsorption and dissociation of water molecules, optimizes the desorption energy of active hydrogen atoms, and enhances the adsorption of urea molecules, thus accelerating the kinetics of HER and UOR. This work facilitates the application of hollow bimetallic phosphides in electrochemical preparation of clean energy and provides a successful paradigm for urea-rich wastewater electrolysis.

TI Iron-Cobalt-Cerium Multimetallic Oxides Derived from Prussian Blue
   Precursors: Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis
SO CHEMPLUSCHEM
AB Exploring non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts is still challenging in 21(st) century. In this work, a series of hexagonal bipyramidal Ce-based PBA materials as precursors with different Fe/Co metal ratios, namely as CeFexCo1-x-PBA, are successfully constructed via co-precipitation method and converted into corresponding metal oxides (denoted as FexCo1-xCeOy) via thermal treatment. Then, they as electrocatalysts realize highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Especially, as-synthesized Fe0.7Co0.3CeOy electrocatalyst shows very low overpotentials of 320 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slop of 98.4 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH with remarkable durability for 24 h, which was due to the synergistic effect of multi-metal FeCoCe centers. Furthermore, a two-electrode cell of Fe0.7Co0.3CeOy/NF||Pt/C/NF realizes outstanding overall water splitting with a voltage of only 1.71 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable long-term durability, that is even superior to benchmark IrO2/NF||Pt/C/NF counterpart.

TI Electrospun prussian blue analogue derived NiCo@N-doped carbon
   nanofibers as efficient and highly stable electrocatalysts for neutral
   overall water splitting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Herein, we demonstrate an effective strategy to improve the catalytic stability and efficiency of inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts via using electrospun Prussian blue analogue derived NiCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NiCo@NC) for neutral overall water splitting. The optimal NiCo@NC-900 exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7), respectively. More importantly, a neutral electrolyzer using NiCo@NC-900 as both HER and OER electrodes achieves high stability with over 140 h and requires a low cell voltage of 1.75 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The remarkable stability and superior activity origin form the unique hierarchically porous and encapsulated structure, large surface area, abundant exposing active sites, and synergistic effect between the highly catalytic active NiCo alloy nanoparticles and high-conductivity N-doped carbon nanofibers, as demonstrated by the detailed analysis before and after HER and OER testing.

TI A highly efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction catalyst
   constructed from a S-treated two-dimensional Prussian blue analogue
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB It is highly desirable for porous coordination polymers (PCPs), including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), to retain their intrinsic characteristics in electrocatalysis, instead of being used as precursors or templates for further total conversion to other compounds via high-temperature calcination. Here, a S-treated two-dimensional (2D) CoFe bimetallic PBA grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) (named S-CoFe-PBA/CFP) is assembled and applied as a highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in 1 M KOH. The resultant S-CoFe-PBA/CFP demonstrates significantly improved OER catalytic activity; overpotentials of only 235, 259, and 272 mV are needed to drive current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a super low Tafel slope of 35.2 mV dec(-1). Even more noteworthy, a current density of 90 mA cm(-2) can be achieved when a potential of 1.5 V vs. RHE is applied, which is 6.4 times higher than that of commercial Ir/C in the same environment. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to two reasons caused by the S-treatment process. On one hand, H+ from intermediates of *OH and *OOH can be captured by -SOx distributed on the surface of the catalyst, thus accelerating the breaking of O-H; on the other hand, partial phase transformation of CoFe-PBA leads to the in situ formation of amorphous CoSx nanogauze on the surface, and the resultant electronic interactions between the two phases contribute much to the improvement of charge transfer and adsorption for OER intermediates. This work provides a new avenue for the design of highly efficient PCP-based OER electrocatalysts.

TI Coordinating gallium hexacyanocobaltate: Prussian blue-based
   nanomaterial for Li-ion storage
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are a type of metal-organic framework and have drawn significant attention recently. To date, most are constructed with divalent transition metal ions coordinated to the N end of a cyanide bridge. In this report, we studied a trivalent gallium ion-based Ga hexacyanocobaltate (GaHCCo), which depicted a face-centered cubic crystal structure. In addition, the synthesized GaHCCo was demonstrated as a cathode material of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and was found to exhibit long-term stability, having a capacity retention of 75% after 3000 cycles of repeated charge-discharge cycling and an extremely high coulombic efficiency of 98%, which was achieved because of a solid-state diffusion controlled Li-ion storage process. After ex situ XRD analysis on the different charge stages, the Li-ion storage in the GaHCCo was attributed to the Co species via the formation of a Li/Co compound. This work will pave the way toward the study of PBAs constructed with trivalent metal ions and provide more insights into the development of high-performance LIBs in the future.

TI New method for the growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes from
   bimetallic nanoalloy catalysts based on Prussian blue analog precursors
SO CARBON
AB Catalyst engineering is a key point for selective growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) with chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Here, we develop a new general synthesis method able to produce a wide range of homogenous bimetallic catalyst nanoparticles with controlled stoichiometry and sizes. The basics of this catalyst synthesis is to use preformed stoichiometric bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanoparticles. Catalyst nanoparticles are then prepared in-situ in a hot filament CVD reactor with subsequent high temperature treatment in reducing atmosphere prior to SWCNT growth. The capabilities of the synthesis route are demonstrated by testing five PBA systems involving various transition metals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning TEM and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX), and in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are used to finely follow the size and composition of the catalyst at each step of the process. Each system yields small size catalysts with a narrow distribution, which act as efficient catalysts for SWCNT growth with a good yield and small diameter distribution. The versatility of the PBA family paves a new way for a fine tuning of the catalyst properties monitored by the metal involved in the PBA, and for opening routes to more selective SWCNT synthesis.

TI Photocatalytic Color Switching of Transition Metal Hexacyanometalate
   Nanoparticles for High-Performance Light-Printable Rewritable Paper
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Developing efficient photoreversible color switching systems for constructing rewritable paper is of significant practical interest owing to the potential environmental benefits including forest conservation, pollution reduction, and resource sustainability. Here we report that the color change associated with the redox chemistry of nanopartides of Prussian blue and its analogues could be integrated with the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanop articles to construct a class of new photoreversible color switching systems, which can be conveniently utilized for fabricating ink-free, light printable rewritable paper with various working colors. The current system also addresses the phase separation issue of the previous organic dye-based color switching system so that it can be conveniently applied to the surface of conventional paper to produce an ink-free light printable rewritable paper that has the same feel and appearance as the conventional paper. With its additional advantages such as excellent scalability and outstanding rewriting performance (reversibility >80 times, legible time >5 days, and resolution >5 mu m), this novel system can serve as an eco-friendly alternative to regular paper in meeting the increasing global needs for environment protection and resource sustainability.

TI Construction of cobalt hexacyanoferrate multivoid nanoframes as
   efficient aqueous aluminum ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB In the search for innovative materials for aqueous Al-ion batteries, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have drawn significant attention due to their open-framework structures. Yet, PBAs face challenges like restricted capacity and rapid capacity deterioration, primarily stemming from the scarcity of redox sites and their inherent structural instability. In the current research, a synthesis of Fe-Co PBA multivoid nanoframe structures was achieved through straightforward co-precipitation techniques, aimed at optimizing Al-ion storage. Key to enhancing their performance was the modulation of the hydrothermal self-assembly reaction duration. As a result of this modulation, a morphological transition from nanocubes to multivoid nanoframes became evident, leading to the exposure of a higher number of active sites. This morphological transition also minimized the effects of volumetric shifts during the electrochemical charge/discharge cycles. Performance analysis indicated that the Fe-Co PBA multivoid nanoframes demonstrated a stable specific capacity, reaching 43 mAh g(-1) over 2000 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). Impressively, even under the more demanding current density of 1 A g(-1), the specific capacity remained a substantial 36 mAh g(-1) after the same number of cycles. Comprehensive ex situ evaluations further underscored the predominant charge storage mechanisms, highlighting the reversible redox activities of the involved transition metals, coupled with the insertion/extraction dynamics of Al3+ ions.

TI Thermally activated carbon-nitrogen vacancies in double-shelled NiFe
   Prussian blue analogue nanocages for enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen
   evolution
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with controllable frame structures and anchored defects represent promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline conditions. Herein, double-shelled NiFe PBAs nanocages have been synthesized through an ion-exchange reaction between K3Fe(CN)(6) and single-shelled Ni(OH)(2) nanocages based on the regulation of nanoscale Kirkendall effect driven by the crystallinity difference between Ni(OH)(2) and NiFe PBAs. With further mild thermal activation, carbon-nitrogen (CN) vacancies could be formed in situ in large quantities in the double-shelled NiFe PBAs nanocages. Theoretical calculation and experimental results prove that the rationally designed double-shelled NiFe PBAs nanocages with an abundance of the exposed surface have a lower energy barrier for the departure of CN groups from NiFe PBAs lattices, and thus generate CN vacancies with a concentration as high as 18.5% via a mild thermal activation strategy, which far outweigh the content of CN vacancies in the solid NiFe PBAs nanocubes. The as-prepared NiFe PBAs with abundant CN vacancies have an impressive OER activity with a low overpotential of 267 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability with only similar to 2.1% potential increase after 78 h. The opened double-shelled structure of NiFe PBAs nanocages offers highly exposed active sites and fast charge transfer kinetics. Moreover, post characterizations demonstrate the important role of CN vacancies in the suppression of Fe loss during the OER process and formation of Fe species as the active sites. This study provides an effective strategy to explore PBAs catalysts with desired nanostructures and defective multiplicity for enhanced OER catalysis.

TI Electrochemical Conversion of Fe3O4 Magnetic
   Nanoparticles to Electroactive Prussian Blue Analogues for
   Self-Sacrificial Label Biosensing of Avian Influenza Virus H5N1
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB A serious impetus always exists to exploit new methods to enrich the prospect of nanomaterials. Here, we report electrochemical conversion (ECC) of magnetic nano particles (MNPs) to electroactive Prussian blue (PB) analogues accompanied by three interfacial effects and its exploitation for novel label self-sacrificial biosensing of avian influenza virus H5N1. The ECC method involves a high potential step to create strong acidic condition by splitting H2O to release Fe3+ from the MNPs, and then a low-potential step leading to the reduction of coexisting K3Fe(CN)(6) and Fe3+ to K4Fe(CN)(6) and Fe2+, respectively, which react to form PB analogues. Unlike conventional solid/liquid electrochemical interfaces that need a supply of reactants by transportation from bulk solution and require additional template to generate porosity, the proposed method introduces MNPs on the electrode surface and makes them natural nanotemplates and nanoconfined sources of reactants. Therefore, the method presents interesting surface templating, generation confinement, and refreshing effects/modes, which benefit the produced PB with higher porosity and electrochemical activity, and 3 orders of magnitude lower requirement for reactant concentration compared with conventional methods. Based on the ECC methods, a sandwich immunosensor is designed for rapid detection of avian influenza virus H5N1 using MNPs as self-sacrificial labels to produce PB for signal amplification. Taking full advantages of the high abundance of Fe in MNPs and three surface effects, the ECC method endows the biosensing technology with high sensitivity and a limit of detection down to 0.0022 hemagglutination units, which is better than those of most reported analogues. The ECC method may lead to a new direction for application of nanomaterials and new electrochemistry modes.

TI Bimetallic phosphide hollow nanocubes derived from a
   prussian-blue-analog used as high-performance catalysts for the oxygen
   evolution reaction
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) based on earth-abundant materials is of significance to enable water splitting as a feasible source of alternative energy. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively employed as the templates/precursors to synthesize catalysts with hollow structures for various energy-related applications. In this study, using MOF (Ni-Fe prussian-blue-analog) as a template and precursor, a novel and promising bimetallic phosphide catalyst (Ni0.62Fe0.38)(2)P was obtained. Benefiting from synergistic effect between the Ni and Fe species, well-defined architecture and high surface area the as-made (Ni0.62Fe0.38)(2)P hollow nanocubes show a remarkable electrocatalytic performance for the OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a low overpotential of only 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 44 mV per decade, which even surpass the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, the (Ni0.62Fe0.38)(2)P hollow nanocubes exhibit good long-term stability. This facile and novel route to prepare bimetallic phosphide hollow nanocubes as active OER catalysts broadens the scope for designing other noble-metal-free OER efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting in the future.

TI Magnetic ordering in an
   (Fe0.2Cr0.8)1.5[Cr(CN)6]
   Prussian blue analogue studied with synchrotron radiation based
   spectroscopies
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB The appearance of magnetic order in the (Fe0.2Cr0.8)(1.5)[Cr(CN)(6)]center dot 15H(2)O Prussian blue analogue at low temperature has been investigated by means of synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. With the help of ligand field multiplet analysis we have been able to identify the oxidation states of the metallic cations present in the sample and their evolution with temperature. Our experiments reveal that the appearance of ferromagnetic order is triggered by the transformation of Cr-III cations to Cr-II high-spin caused by a transfer of electrons from the Fe to the Cr resulting in an increase of the magnetic interactions within the (Cr, Cr) sublattice. The misfit strain between the (Fe, Cr) and the (Cr, Cr) moieties that coexist within this ternary material influences the balance of oxidation states and hence the magnetic properties of the metallic ions. Misfit relaxation also plays a role in determining the differences between the surface and the bulk of the material. The measurement of the magnetic moments in those two regions suggests that the surface may have a reduced Curie temperature compared to the bulk.

TI Core-Shell MnFe Nanocatalyst Derived from Prussian Blue Analogs for
   Peroxymonosulfate Activation: Nonradical Mechanism and Bimetallic
   Valence Cycle
SO LANGMUIR
AB Sulfamethazine (SAT) is widely present in sediment, soil, rivers, and groundwater. Unfortunately, traditional water treatment technologies are inefficient at eliminating SAT from contaminated water. Therefore, developing an effective and ecologically friendly treatment procedure to effectively remove SAT is critical. This has raised concerns about its potential impact on the environment and human health. In this study, metal-organic-inorganic composites consisting of graphene-encapsulated Fe-Mn metal catalyst (Mn3Fe1-NC) were synthesized by calcining MnFe Prussian blue analogs (PBA) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The composites were applied to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and facilitate the degradation of SAT in aquatic environments. The Mn3Fe1-NC, dosed with 5 mg, in combination with PMS, dosed with 1.5 mmol L-1, achieved a 91.8% degradation efficiency of SAT. The transformation of the CN skeleton led to the formation of a carbon shell structure, which consequently reduced metal ion leaching from the material. At various pH levels, the iron and manganese ions were observed to leach out at levels lower than 0.1392 and 0.0580 mg L-1, respectively. In contrast, the Mn3Fe1-NC was found to be minimally impacted by pH levels and coexisting ions present in the aqueous environment. Radical burst experiments and electrochemical analysis tests verified that degradation primarily occurs through the nonradical pathway of electron transfer. The active sites responsible for this process were identified as the Mn (IV) and graphitic-N atoms on the material, which facilitate direct electron transfer. Additionally, the presence of Fe atoms promotes the valence cycling of Mn atoms. This study introduces new insights into the reaction mechanism and the constitutive relationship of catalytic centers in nonradical oxidation reactions.

TI Hollow Prussian blue analogue-derived (CoFe)Se2 composites:
   Structural designing for preparing flexible, high-performance
   solid-state supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Selenides show higher corrosion and oxidation resistance than conventional materials. Moreover, bimetallic selenide materials typically show higher electrical conductivity than monometallic materials, which accelerates their electron transfer kinetics during charge-discharge cycling. The combination of two different metals in bimetallic selenides improves the energy-storage capacity and provides a stable electrochemical environment resulting from their unique electronic structure and interaction with the electrolyte. Among various bimetallic selenides, cobalt-iron selenides are especially noted for their excellent electrocatalytic properties. In this study, we synthesised co-doped hollow Prussian blue (PB) analogue nanocubes with large sizes, high specific surface areas and many active sites. When employed as the positive electrode in a flexible solid-state supercapacitor, bimetallic (CoFe)Se-2 nanocomposites obtained at 500 degrees C in nitrogen showed high supercapacitor performance, with a capacitance of 1710 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1); extended cycle life (maintaining 98.5% of their initial capacitance after 3000 cycles at 5 A g(-1)) and near 100% Coulombic efficiency. Further, a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor ((CoFe)Se-2 //activated carbon (AC)) was developed using AC and (CoFe)Se-2 as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively. (CoFe)Se-2//AC achieved a Coulombic efficiency of 90 % and outstanding cycling stability, maintaining 93.5% of its original capacity after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g(-1). The specific capacitance and energy density were 40 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 750 W kg(-1) (10.41 W kg(-1)), respectively. This research paves the way for rational and environmentally friendly synthesis of bimetallic selenides with distinct sizes and topologies. By varying the metal dopant, our method can potentially produce bimetallic selenides for diverse applications.

TI Single-Phase θ-Fe3C Derived from Prussian Blue and Its
   Catalytic Application in Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis
SO CATALYSTS
AB Elucidation of the intrinsic catalytic principle of iron carbides remains a substantial challenge in iron-catalyzed Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), due to possible interference from other Fe-containing species. Here, we propose a facile approach to synthesize single-phase theta-Fe3C via the pyrolysis of a molecularly defined Fe-C complex (Fe-4[Fe(CN)(6)](3)), thus affording close examination of its catalytic behavior during FTS. The crystal structure of prepared theta-Fe3C is unambiguously verified by combined XRD and MES measurement, demonstrating its single-phase nature. Strikingly, single-phase theta-Fe3C exhibited excellent selectivity to light olefins (77.8%) in the C-2-C-4 hydrocarbons with less than 10% CO2 formation in typical FTS conditions. This strategy further succeeds with promotion of Mn, evident for its wide-ranging compatibility for the promising industrial development of catalysts. This work offers a facile approach for oriented preparation of single-phase theta-Fe3C and provides an in-depth understanding of its intrinsic catalytic performance in FTS.

TI Prussian blue analog-derived nickel iron phosphide-reduced graphene
   oxide hybrid as an efficient catalyst for overall water electrolysis
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Efficient and bifunctional nonprecious catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evo-lution reaction (HER) are essential for the production of green hydrogen via water electrolysis. Transition metal (Ni, Co, Fe, etc.) phosphides are frequently documented HER catalysts, whereas their bimetallic oxi-des are efficient OER catalysts, thus enabling bifunctional catalysis for water electrolysis via proper oper-ation. Herein, phosphide-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrids were prepared from graphene oxide (GO)-incorporated bimetal Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursors. The hybrids could experience partial surface oxidation to create oxide layers with OER activities, and the hybrids also possessed considerable HER properties, therefore enabling bifunctional catalytic features for water electrolysis. The typical NiFeP-rGO hybrid demonstrated an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and good durability for OER, as well as moderate HER catalytic features (overpotential of 165 mV at-10 mA cm-2 and acceptable catalytic stability). Due to the bifunctional catalytic features, the NiFeP-rGO-based symmetric water elec-trolyzer demonstrated a moderate input voltage and high faradaic efficiency (FE) for O2 and H2 produc-tion. The current work provides a feasible way to prepare OER and HER bifunctional catalysts by facile phosphorization of PBA-associated precursors and spontaneous surface oxidation. Given the oxidation/ reduction bifunctional catalytic behaviors, phosphide-rGO hybrid catalysts have great potential for wide-spread application in fields beyond water electrolysis, such as electrochemical pollution abatement, sen-sors, energy devices and organic syntheses.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI Three-dimensional core-shell CoFe Prussian blue analog at NiCoFe layered
   ternary hydroxide electrocatalyst for efficient oxygen evolution
   reaction
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Layered double hydroxides are one of the most effective electrocatalysts owing to their compositional and structural flexibility. However, their self-stacking leads to limited active sites and low conductivity. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) core-shell architecture with spatially separated active sites has been fabricated based on layered ternary nickel cobalt iron hydroxide (NiCoFe-LTH) nanosheets and cobalt iron Prussian blue analog (CoFe-PBA) on nickel foam (NF) (i.e., CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF) with CoFe-PBA as self-sacrificial templates that are partially in situ transformed into NiCoFe-LTH nanosheets. The CoFe-PBA@NiCoFe-LTH/NF has a well-defined core-shell 3D flower-like nanostructure in which NiCoFe-LTH nanosheets create the larger shell while CoFe-PBA nanocubes form the small core. This hybrid structure is evaluated as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and found to exhibit a low overpotential of 228mV at 10mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 36mV dec(-1), and good catalytic stability for 72 h in 1.0 M alkaline solution. The strong performance is attributed to the unique 3D core-shell flower-like nanosheet architecture that avoids the stacking of the 2D LTH, provides abundant spatially separated active sites, and enhances electron transport and stability. Furthermore, the OER mechanism and growth process of the electrocatalysts were systematically studied. These results suggest that such electrocatalysts with unique architecture are promising for efficient and durable OER.

TI Concurrent antibiosis and anti-inflammation against bacterial pneumonia
   by zinc hexacyanoferrate nanocatalysts
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The bacterial pneumonia has been demonstrated to cause acute and severe pathological lung injury as well as the uncontrollable oxidative cytokine storms. The effective therapeutics against bacterial pneumonia demands highly efficient pathogen elimination, oxidative stress alleviation and anti-inflammation. Nevertheless, current therapeutics fail to achieve these goals by a single medicine with satisfactory performance. Herein, we report a self-assembled zinc-doped prussian blue-analogue - zinc hexacyanoferrate nanocatalysts (ZnPBA NCs) possessing excellent broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity and antioxidative catalytic activities against multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the associated cytokine storm as well. By employing various oxidative substances and in vivo murine bacterial pneumoniae models, we verified that the synthetic zinc hexacyanoferrate nanocatalysts could concurrently eliminate the bacterial infection and largely alleviate infection-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, demonstrating the promising clinical application potentials against diverse bacterial infection-related diseases.

TI Ni-doped CdS porous cubes prepared from prussian blue nanoarchitectonics
   with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB In this paper, NixCdyS composite photocatalysts were synthesized by using Ni-doped Cd -Co PBA as the precursor, which retains the advantages of PBA such as porous structure, large specific surface and highly dispersed metal active sites. The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance over NixCdyS is three times higher than that of pure CdS with H2 yield of 8.45 mmol g-1 h-1. The catalyst was analyzed by the UV/Vis absorption spectra, photoluminescence spectra, time-resolved photoluminescence spectra, transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectra, Mott-Schottky test, etc. A series of characterization results prove that the electron-hole recombination rate, electrochemical resistance and band gap of nickel-doped CdS composites are obviously smaller than CdS, which are important factors to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. This work may provide some reference value for the fabrication of other functional materials using PBA as precursors.

TI Construction of highly dispersed and electroconductive silver
   nanoparticles modified mesoporous Co3O4 hollow
   nanoboxes from Prussian blue analogues for boosting lithium storage
   performances
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A facile strategy for the synthesis of well-conductive Ag nanoparticles decorated mesoporous Co3O4 nanoboxes is reported. The fabrication processes involve a thermal annealing of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) Prussian blue analogue (PBA) template and subsequent in-situ chemical reductive deposition of Ag coating. The obtained electrically conductive Ag-coated Co3O4 hollow nanoboxes (Ag@Co3O4 HNBs) electrodes possess remarkable lithium storage performances as anodes including high reversible capacity, improved rate capability and long-life cyclability than bare Co3O4 HNBs. The optimized Ag@Co3O4 HNB anodes demonstrate high lithium storage capacity of 1015 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), distinguished reactivated capacity (1115 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and decent rate capability (339 mA h g(-1) at 5A g(-1)). The key points of improved electrochemical behaviors for Ag@Co3O4 composites are due to the formation of Co3O4 hierarchical nanostructure with high porosity as well as the enhancement of electrical conductivity introduced by Ag nanoparticles films.

TI Low porosity, high areal-capacity Prussian blue analogue electrodes
   enhance salt removal and thermodynamic efficiency in symmetric Faradaic
   deionization with automated fluid control
SO WATER RESEARCH X
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) show great potential for low-energy Faradaic deionization (FDI) with reversible Na-ion capacity approaching 5 M in the solid-state. However, past continuous-flow demonstrations using PBAs in FDI were unable to desalinate brackish water to potable levels using single-pass architectures. Here, we show that recirculation of effluent from a symmetric cation intercalation desalination cell into brine/diluate reservoirs enables salt removal exceeding 80% at thermodynamic efficiency as high as 80% when cycled with 100 mM NaCl influent and when controlled by a low-volume, automated fluid circuit. This exceptional performance is achieved using a novel heated, alkaline wet phase inversion process that modulates colloidal forces to increase carbon black aggregation within electrode slurries to solidify crack-free, high areal-capacity PBA electrodes that are calendered to minimize cell impedance and electrode porosity. The results obtained demonstrate the need for co-design of auxiliary fluid-control systems together with electrode materials to advance FDI beyond brackish salinity.

TI MOF-derived multi-interface carbon-based composites with enhanced
   polarization loss and efficient microwave absorption
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SMART AND NANO MATERIALS
AB Metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) have been widely studied because of their adjustable composition and controllable structure in the field of microwave absorption (MA). Therein, Prussian blue analogs (PBA) have attracted the attention of researchers with ultra-high metal content. However, the attenuation ability of microwave for PBA-based composites is still unsatisfactory up to now. Therefore, the NiFe/CoFe@C composites were prepared by carbonizing polymetallic PBA (NiCoFe PBA) materials in this work, and the influence of different metal alloy components on MA was explored by adjusting the ratio of metal ions (Ni2+/Co2+). Moreover, the NiFe/CoFe@C composites have rich interfaces and enhance the polarization loss due to the introduction of Ni and it has an optimal performance at 2.7 mm that is the reflection loss (RL) is -41.49 dB and an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) is 7.12 GHz with 1/1 (Ni2+/Co2+). The above data provides a research idea for obtaining light and efficient absorbers.

The Fe-ion storage mechanism was revealed using the in situ XRD technique and DFT calculations were employed to analyse the battery performance.

TI Structure evolution of Prussian blue analogues to CoFe@C core-shell
   nanocomposites with good microwave absorbing performances
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Novel uniform CoFe@C core-shell composite nanoparticles with good distribution have been fabricated through the combined self-assembly and controlled thermal decomposition of Co-based Prussian blue (PB) nanocubes. Good intrinsic magnetic properties including a high saturation magnetization of 90.9-182.5 A m(2) kg(-1) and a high coercivity of 192-510 Oe are achieved for these CoFe@C nanocomposites. Excellent wave absorbing properties, including a minimum reflection loss value of -43.5 dB at 9.92 GHz with a sample thickness of 2.5 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth of 4.3 GHz (below -10 dB), are obtained for the CoFe@C nanocomposites, which can be ascribed to the good magnetic properties originating from CoFe as the core and the good electrical conductivity from the graphite carbon layers. These CoFe@C nanocomposites also show good structural stability and low density, which further increases their potential for application as high-performance electromagnetic wave-absorbing materials.

TI Soft-hard interface design in super-elastic conductive polymer hydrogel
   containing Prussian blue analogues to enable highly efficient
   electrochemical deionization
SO MATERIALS HORIZONS
AB The poor cycling stability of faradaic materials owing to volume expansion and stress concentration during faradaic processes limits their use in large-scale electrochemical deionization (ECDI) applications. Herein, we developed a "soft-hard" interface by introducing conducting polymer hydrogels (CPHs), that is, polyvinyl alcohol/polypyrrole (PVA/PPy), to support the uniform distribution of Prussian blue analogues (e.g., copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF)). In this design, the soft buffer layer of the hydrogel effectively alleviates the stress concentration of CuHCF during the ion-intercalation process, and the conductive skeleton of the hydrogel provides charge-transfer pathways for the electrochemical process. Notably, the engineered CuHCF@PVA/PPy demonstrates an excellent salt-adsorption capacity of 22.7 mg g(-1) at 10 mA g(-1), fast salt-removal rate of 1.68 mg g(-1) min(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), and low energy consumption of 0.49 kW h kg(-1). More importantly, the material could maintain cycling stability with 90% capacity retention after 100 cycles, which is in good agreement with in situ X-ray diffraction tests and finite element simulations. This study provides a simple strategy to construct three-dimensional conductive polymer hydrogel structures to improve the desalination capacity and cycling stability of faradaic materials with universality and scalability, which promotes the development of high-performance electrodes for ECDI.

TI Prussian blue analogue Cu3[Fe(CN)6]2
   derived N-doped Cu/Fe3C clusters as an excellent non-noble
   metal ORR catalyst for microbial fuel cells
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB An excellent non-noble metal ORR catalyst is fabricated using Prussian blue analogue (Cu-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)) and melamine via a simple process. Cu-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) serve as both the template for the pore formation and the precursor for the ORR active sites. Melamine has the following advantages: melamine contains higher content of nitrogen for the preparation of pyridinic-N, graphitic-N, and pyrrolic-N to improve the ORR performance; in addition, during pyrolysis, carbon nitrogen species decomposed from melamine at higher temperature can subsequently bind with metal atoms to form M-Nx moieties, preventing metal atoms from aggregation. In this novel catalyst (Cu/Fe/N-C), nitrogen-coordinated Cu and Fe3C clusters (about 3 nm) are homogeneously dispersed on the surface of the carbon substrate. Owing to the synergic effect of its unique multi-interface hetero structure, rapid ion transport in its porous structure and plenty of high nitrogen-coordinated Cu/Fe clusters catalytic active sites, Cu/Fe/N-C displayed excellent ORR performances, with much more positive on-set potential (0.12 V vs Ag/AgCl) and half-wave potential (0.00 V vs Ag/AgCl). When used in air-cathode MFCs, the maximum output voltage and power density of Cu/Fe/N-C were slight less than those of the commercial 20% PVC, but the stability and methanol tolerance were superior. Significantly, the cost of Cu/Fe/N-C was lower than PVC and the method of synthesizing catalyst was facile. Thus, this novel catalyst was a promising alternative ORR replacing PVC catalyst used in future industrial application. This strategy, combing prussian blue analogue with melamine to fabrication clusters catalyst, exhibits a promising prospect for broadening the development ORR catalysts in energy.

TI Formation of hollow stepped FePBA@rGO anode for high-performance
   lithium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) have been considered promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacity and cost-effectiveness. However, they often encounter challenges such as poor electronic conductivity and structural instability. Herein, we introduce a hollow stepped FePBA framework structure coated with reduced graphene oxide (FePBA@rGO). This sophisticated design significantly improves electronic conductivity and optimizes the diffusion pathways for lithium ions, leading to exceptional cycling stability and rate performance. The FePBA@rGO-15 anode developed in this study shows a notable rate capability of 294 mAh g- 1 at a current density of 2 A g- 1 . More significantly, it demonstrates exceptional lithium storage performance, maintaining a capacity of 1245 mAh g- 1 after 600 cycles at a current density of 1 A g- 1 . Density functional theory simulations further support our findings by illustrating that the robust interface between FePBA and rGO significantly accelerates the reactions kinetics of Li+ + within the FePBA framework. This study represents a significant advancement towards improving the capacity and cycling stability of PBA-based anode materials, offering promising prospects for future battery applications.

TI Large and tunable negative thermal expansion induced by a synergistic
   effect in M2<SUP>II</SUP>[M<SUP>IV</SUP>(CN)8]
   Prussian blue analogues
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Designing negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials with a larger NTE coefficient and a wider temperature window is a great challenge nowadays, leading to the limitation of existing NTE materials such that only about 150 kinds of NTE materials have been discovered since 1996. Here, using first-principles calculations combined with the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), we find that the synergistic effect of different vibrational modes can significantly enhance the NTE in open framework compounds. We systematically investigate the NTE properties of the (M2MIV)-M-II(CN)(8)(M-II= Ni, Co, Fe, and Mn; M-IV= Mo and W) family, which is the first kind of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with a 2D and 3D topology structure, to explore the synergistic enhancement effect in NTE. We reveal that both the optical modes of the rotational motion of [W(CN)(8)] and [Ni(NC)(4)] rigid units and the low frequency acoustic modes of the transverse vibration contribute significantly to the NTE. Furthermore, the coefficients of NTE increase monotonously with increasing ionic radius upon substituting Ni in (M2W)-W-II(CN)(8)with Co, Fe, or Mn, respectively. Analyzing the vibrational modes of the substituted systems indicates that the dramatic changes in NTE originate from a highly synergistic effect, in which all the frequencies of these NTE modes have the same trend,i.e.the lower the frequencies, the larger the coefficient of NTE. This work clearly presents a synergistic mechanism of enhancing NTE in PBA materials, and sheds light on designing new materials with better properties.

TI Regulation of Ion Transport in Prussian Blue MOF Films by a Ru-Complex
   Primer Nanolayer on an ITO Electrode and Its Energy Storage Application
SO ACS APPLIED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB The control of ion and electron transport (ET) by external stimuli in redox-active crystals of Prussian blue (PB), a well-known nanoporous metal-organic framework (MOF), is key to the development of PB-based electronic and energy devices. To achieve ion storage and release in PB nanopores, thin layers of redox-active Ru complexes were inserted as a primer layer between an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and a PB film for electrochemical interfacing. On unmodified ITO electrodes, PB films can be oxidized to Berlin Green (BG) and reduced to Prussian White (PW) via two-step processes. However, the Ru-complex-modified heterolayer films ITO parallel to(Ru-complex)(3)/(PB) exhibited only one redox process, i.e., either PB/PW or BG/PB, due to the ET rectification between the PB and the Ru complex, which depends on the redox potential of the Ru complex. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements indicated that the storage/release of K+ ions in the PB nanopores is gated by the redox potential of the Ru-complex primer layer. The slower rate of ion transport relative to ET leads to a large hysteresis loop on EQCM, which can be exploited to develop ion storage memory devices. Additionally, a K+ ion rocking-chair-type asymmetric redox capacitor was constructed by combining two ITO parallel to(Ru-complex)(3)/(PB) films. The electrochemical interfacing of redox-active PB MOF crystals on the heterojunction electrode surface can thus be expected to open new possibilities for charge storage via the regulation of ion transport in the PB-based devices.

TI A novel edge-rich structure of CuO/Co3O4 derived
   from Prussian blue analogue as a high-rate and ultra-stable electrode
   for efficient capacitive storage
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Metal oxides derived from Prussian blue (PB) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are usually used as electrode materials of supercapacitors (SCs). However, the disadvantage is few external active sites. We have successfully developed a novel yet facile strategy to prepare a novel Cu-Co mixed metal oxide (CuO/Co3O4) derived from Cu-based PBA (Cu-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot 9H(2)O), which can form the edge-rich structure to expose more active sites. The edge-rich structure greatly improves charge storage kinetics of electrode material, and the capacitive contribution can even reach 99% at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1). Even at a low specific surface area, this novel electrode material possesses excellently ultra-stable and high-rate performance in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte (76.7% capacity retention when the current density increases from 1 to 10 A g(-1)). Moreover, the hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) fabricated with the positive electrode edge-rich CuO/Co3O4 and the negative electrode nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogel (NDGH) delivers remarkable cycling stability (After 7000 cycles, 98.9% capacity is maintained). These excellent electrochemical performances can be attributed to a novel edge-rich structure, which is beneficial for exposing active sites in the external surface and thus promotes the capacitive contribution for fast redox reaction. This strategy opens up a new avenue for promoting electrochemical performance by mediating interfaces and can be extended to the fields of battery and electrocatalysis. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Tuning the d-Band Center in Prussian Blue Analogues via Modulated Carbon
   and Nitrogen Coordinated Metals for Boosted Bi-Functional Oxygen
   Electrocatalytic Activity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The d-band center is a promising descriptor to understand trends in electrocatalysis extensively studied in transition metal oxides but largely unexplored in metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Herein, we present our systematic study aimed at developing a mini-volcano plot demonstrating dependence of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on their d-band center. Our results from ex-situ core level and valence band XPS, Raman, and FTIR spectroscopy suggest that the tuning of the d-band center via modulated N and C-coordinated metal centers dictates their electrocatalytic OER and ORR activities. Among PBAs, the CoCo PBA exhibits highest activity due to its optimal position of d-band center and abundant Co3+ active sites. Moreover, M-Co PBAs showcased superior performance compared to M-Fe PBAs, attributed to facile formation of surface-active sites, i.e., metal oxy(hydroxide). The study advances the understanding of the influence of metal center tuning in PBAs on the intermediate energies and catalytic activity.

TI Fluorine-doped tin oxide/ hematite/ Ni(OH)2/ Prussian white
   photoelectrode for use in a visible-light-assisted pseudocapacitor
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Herein, a fluorine-doped tin oxide/hematite/nickel hydroxide/Prussian white photoelectrode is fabricated for use in a visible-light-assisted pseudocapacitor. A visible-light-assisted pseudocapacitor is a two-electrode device that uses both electrical and solar energy sources to charge and store energy. The photoelectrode consists of a thin layer of Prussian white deposited on a nickel hydroxide modified hematite film. The hematite is used as a photoactive material, nickel hydroxide and Prussian white are employed as the pseudo-capacitive electroactive materials. Fluorine-doped tin oxide/hematite/nickel hydroxide/Prussian white has a much higher charge-discharge time and areal capacitance under illumination. A galvanostatic charge-discharge curve shows an areal capacitance of 2.16 mF cm(-2) under illumination, that is 940-fold higher than that in the dark. This behavior is attributed to the presence of photogenerated charges that increase the conductivity and facilitate charge transfer reactions. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that the charge transfer resistance under illumination is 633 Omega which is more than three times lower than 2220 Omega under dark. Therefore, under dark pseudocapacitive charge storage reactions do not occur significantly, because of the high resistance of semiconductor. While under illumination, photogenerated charges reduce charge transfer resistance. Thus, the pseudocapacitive reaction is progressed and the charge is stored.

TI Prussian blue analogue-derived Co-Ni 5 P 4 porous nanosheet arrays
   composite coal-based carbon nanofibers as efficient self-supported
   electrocatalyst for overall water splitting
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB The development of economical, earth-rich, and high -performance transition metal phosphides electrocatalysts is crucial for water splitting. Herein, the NiCo PBA/Ni(OH) 2 hierarchical nanostructure arrays are in situ grown on the coal-based carbon nanofibers (C-CNFs) using hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods. Subsequently, the Co-doped Ni 5 P 4 porous nanosheet arrays composite coal-based carbon nanofibers electrocatalyst (Co-Ni 5 P 4 @C- CNFs) is obtained through low-temperature phosphorization process. Benefiting from cation-doped, porous nanosheet arrays structure and self-supported conductive substrates, the Co-Ni 5 P 4 @C-CNFs has excellent electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting. It provides low overpotentials of 75 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 231 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm -2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the Co-Ni 5 P 4 @C-CNFs demonstrates a low overall water splitting cell voltage of 1.537 V at current density of 10 mA cm -2 and remarkable long-term stability for over 160 h. It outperforms the most transition metal phosphide bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. This research provides a novel strategy for synthesizing high -performance transition metal phosphides bifunctional electrocatalysts.

TI [Fe(CN)6] vacancy-boosting oxygen evolution activity of
   Co-based Prussian blue analogues for hybrid sodium-air battery
SO MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have emerged as efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their porous structure with well-dispersed active sites. However, Co-based PBA (Co-PBA) electrocatalysts are characterized by moderate OER kinetics. In this study, we developed a facile high-yield strategy to fabricate defective Co-PBA (D-Co-PBA) with [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies and exposed Co (III) active sites by post-oxidation treatment of the pristine Co-PBA with aqueous H2O2. Rietveld refinement results show that the lattice parameter (a) and unit-cell volume (V) of D-Co-PBA are smaller than those of the pristine Co-PBA, thereby confirming the generation of [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancy can effectively regulate the electronic structure of D-CoPBA; this condition reduces the reaction barrier of the rate-determining step toward OER. In OER, the DCo-PBA catalyst achieves a lower overpotential of 400 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(2), which is superior to that of Ir/C (430 mV) and Co-PBA (450 mV). A hybrid sodium-air battery assembled with Pt/C and D-Co-PBA catalysts displays a discharge voltage of 2.75 V, an ultralow charging-discharging gap of 0.15 V, and a round-trip efficiency of 94.83% on the 1000th cycle at the current density of 0.01 mA cm(-2). This study is highly promising for large-scale production of affordable and effective PBA-based materials with desirable OER activity for metal-air batteries and water-alkali electrolyzers, thus helping achieve the goal of sustainability.

TI Integrating Prussian Blue Analog-Based Nanozyme and Online Visible Light
   Absorption Approach for Continuous Hydrogen Sulfide Monitoring in Brains
   of Living Rats
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The continuous detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is significant for revealing its role in the neuron protection and diagnosis of various diseases. In this study, a Prussian blue analog nanocubes (PBA NCs)-based oxidase-like mimic was synthesized and designed for continuous H2S monitoring in a visible light absorption-based online optical detection platform (OODP). A specific chemical reaction between H2S and the PBA NCs induce a decreasing oxidase-like activity of the PBA NCs, generating lower amounts of oxidized products of 3,3'5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and increasing the light intensity. By coupling the microdialysis techniques with OODP, excellent linearity in the range of 0.1-20 mu M H2S with a limit of detection of 33 nM and outstanding stability, reproducibility, and specificity in the response to H2S were exhibited. By using this OODP, near real-time response and continuous H2S measurements in the brains of living rats were successfully achieved. This new idea of integrating enzyme-like mimics with specific chemical reactions to form an online optical detection platform for continuous monitoring of neurochemical in the brain may be highly meaningful for thoroughly understanding the function of the brain.

TI Three-dimensional coated CuNiFe-Prussian blue analogue@MXene
   heterostructure for capacitive deionization to slow down the damage of
   MXene by dissolved oxygen
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Within the capacitive deionization (CDI) realm, the two-dimensional (2D) layered material T3C2Tx MXene has drawn lots of attention because of its excellent electrical conductivity, reversible ionic intercalation/deintercalation capacity, and extensive active sites. However, the performance of MXene is compromised by the fact that its surface is susceptible to oxidation by dissolved oxygen and has inherent defects of self-stacking. In this paper, CuNiFe-Prussian blue analogue@MXene (CuNiFe-PBA@MXene) with three-dimensional (3D) coated heterostructure is successfully prepared by the in-situ coprecipitation. CuNiFe-PBA is uniformly coated on the MXene surface as a functional layer to avoid the re-stacking of MXene, to enlarge their layer spacing, and to slow down the damage of MXene by dissolved oxygen. Based on a coated structure constructed by a good combination of dual pseudocapacitive materials, the CuNiFe-PBA@MXene electrode has excellent electrochemical performance (250F g- 1). The composed MXene//CuNiFe-PBA@MXene hybrid cell in 500 mg/L NaCl has higher desalination capacity (44.94 mg/g), lower energy consumption (0.66 kWh kg- 1), and excellent desalination capacity retention (93.46 % after 40 adsorption/desorption cycles).

TI Pollutant degradation by Fenton-like system with Prussian blue analogs
   (PBAs) on cotton and modified oyster shell: Via re-Fenton reaction
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Advanced oxidation processes extensively use Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) catalysts. However, metal-ion leaching limits their application in Fenton-like systems, causing environmental pollution and a decline in long-term performance. This study prepared a cubic iron-manganese bimetallic PBA catalyst by co-precipitation-calcination method. In the suspended flow experiment, under the optimal conditions, methylene blue (MB) was degraded by over 99.92 % within 90 min. The synergistic effect of iron-manganese bimetallic components and the degradation pathway of MB was proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) analysis and LC-MS results. In the recycling experiment, metal-ion leaching and catalyst structure damage significantly reduced the catalyst activity. To overcome the metal-leaching problem of PBA materials, a continuous-flow Fenton-like system was constructed. Cotton balls loaded with the iron-manganese bimetallic catalyst were connected to a calcined oyster shell fixed-bed reactor. In the 60 h continuous-inflow experiment, the average MB degradation rate of the effluent reached 95.81 %, which was 25.42 % higher than that of the single catalyst continuous-flow system. Experiments and characterization verified the mechanism of improving the reaction effect by using modified oyster shell. This shell can effectively adsorb the iron and manganese metal ions leached during the reaction, and these adsorbed metal ions further promoted the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) oxidation of MB through heterogeneous Fenton reaction, which was called re-Fenton reaction. This study provided a new strategy for the practical application of PBA catalysts in advanced oxidation processes.

TI Constructing FeCo@C core-shell structure with strong polarization
   behavior towards excellent microwave absorption performance
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB In this study, the electromagnetic wave absorption properties of derivatives of metal-organic frameworks (Prussian blue analogues) were investigated. Here, we use the co-precipitation method to combine metal ions (Mn2+, Ni2+, Co2+) with potassium ferricyanide to obtain cubic precursors. Subsequently, a series of carboncoated bimetallic alloy absorbers with a core-shell structure were obtained by pyrolysis in a vacuum thermal environment. Moreover, the effect of temperature on the structure and electromagnetic absorption properties of FeCo@C was further explored. FeCo@C-600 achieves an effective bandwidth of 5.63 GHz at a thickness of 1.8 mm, and the minimum reflection loss is as high as -66.69 dB. Its best microwave absorption performance comes from the polarization sites provided by the abundant heterogeneous planes and defects, enabling it to obtain enhanced polarization loss. The final results show that the method of optimizing performance by enriching polarization methods can provide a new idea for obtaining high-efficiency absorbing materials with thin thickness and wide frequency coverage.

TI Hollow Multivoid Nanocuboids Derived from Ternary Ni-Co-Fe Prussian Blue
   Analog for Dual-Electrocatalysis of Oxygen and Hydrogen Evolution
   Reactions
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Hydrogen generation from electrochemical water-splitting is an attractive technology for clean and efficient energy conversion and storage, but it requires efficient and robust non-noble electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Nonprecious transition metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising precursors for developing advanced functional catalysts with high porosity and structural rigidity. Herein, a new transition metal-based hollow multivoid nanocuboidal catalyst synthesized from a ternary Ni-Co-Fe (NCF)-MOF precursor is rationally designed to produce dual-functionality toward OER and HER. Differing ion exchanging rates of the ternary transition metals within the prussian blue analog MOF precursor are exploited to produce interconnected internal voids, heteroatom doping, and a favorably tuned electronic structure. This design strategy significantly increases active surface area and pathways for mass transport, resulting in excellent electroactivities toward OER and HER, which are competitive with recently reported single-function nonprecious catalysts. Moreover, outstanding electrochemical durability is realized due to the unique rigid and interconnected porous structure which considerably retains initial rapid charge transfer and mass transport of active species. The MOF-based material design strategy demonstrated here exemplifies a novel and versatile approach to developing non-noble electrocatalysts with high activity and durability for advanced electrochemical water-splitting systems.

TI Chemical etching to regulation oxygen vacancies on Mn-Fe PBA for highly
   efficient degradation of bisphenol A and acetaminophen
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been widely explored as catalyst for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. However, the drawbacks of poor electron transfer ability and degradation performance of PBAs hinder their practical application. In this study, oxygen vacancy (OV)-rich Mn-Fe PBA was regulated through phosphoric acid and ammonia water chemical etching to overcome these drawbacks. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicated that the regulation of OVs was favorable for more Fe2+ and Mn3+ active sites exposure and higher specific surface area to facilitate PMS activation. Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-), hydroxyl radical (HO center dot), and single oxygen (O-1(2)) were verified as main reactive species for PMS activation during catalytic reaction. Density functional theory calculation results showed that the OV-rich NOE-PC-300 had the highest pollutants degradation capability, with complete degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) and acetaminophen (APAP) within 40 min. Through regulation of OVs by chemical etching, highlighted adsorption ability and elongated O-O bond of PMS were obtained. This research showed that NOE-PC-300 is an efficient and harmless catalyst for activating PMS, and it has immense application potential in practical wastewater treatment.

TI Magnetically separable graphene-based Ni-Fe mixed metal oxide nanocubes
   derived from a Prussian- blue analogue: synthesis, structure and
   application in oxidative degradation of bisphenol A
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Mixed metal oxide (MMO) nanocubes were prepared by calcining a Ni-Fe Prussian-blue analogue (Ni-Fe PBA) and then uniformly supported on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a simple hydrothermal reaction instead of the commonly used etching. The structural characterization showed that the obtained Ni-Fe MMO/RGO has a larger specific surface area than those prepared by etching. Moreover, Ni-Fe MMO/RGO exhibited better catalytic performance in advanced oxidation. 95% of bisphenol A can be removed within 20 min, which is faster and needs less persulfate than the degradation catalyzed by the recently reported MMO catalysts derived from PBA. In addition, Ni-Fe MMO/RGO is magnetically separable, which shows great potential for practical applications.

TI Efficient and stable heterostructured Co9S8/Cu7S4 composite counter
   electrodes derived from Prussian blue analogs for quantum dot-
   sensitized solar cells
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The challenge of boosting the efficiency of QDSSCs lies in the rational development and design of eco-nomical, stable and efficient counter electrode (CE) catalysts for fast and efficient electron transport at the CE/electrolyte interface. Here, we creatively construct Co9S8/Cu7S4 heterostructure composite CEs using CuCo-Prussian blue analogs (PBA) as precursor by one-step in-situ solvothermal vulcanization method. Work function analysis and systematic electrochemical characterizations reveal that the presence of het-erojunctions in the Co9S8/Cu7S4 can increase the interfacial electric field driving force inside the material, thereby reducing the Rct at CE/electrolyte interface, promoting the efficient transfer of electrons. Correspondingly, the Co9S8/Cu7S4 composite CE can improve the stability and compensate for the deficiency of the single component CE through a decent synergistic catalytic effect. Remarkably, the Mn-CdS/CdSe/ZnS co-sensitized QDSSC equipped with Co9S8/Cu7S4 heterostructure composite CE delivers an optimal con-version efficiency of 8.43% with Jsc = 23.42 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.672 V; FF = 0.54, which was significantly superior to physically mixed CE (PM-Co9S8/Cu7S4, 6.55%), single-component CE (Cu7S4, 5.60%; Co9S8, 5.13%) and conventional Brass/Cu2S CE (4.96%). In briefly, the advanced heterostructure engineering and the abundant, tunable chemical elemental composition of PBA provide new views for the purposeful design of economical and outstanding heterostructured composite CEs.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Interface-induced contraction of core-shell Prussian blue analogues
   toward hollow Ni-Co-Fe phosphide nanoboxes for efficient oxygen
   evolution electrocatalysis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Hollow metal phosphides play an important role in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but directly phosphatizing solid precursors into well-defined hollow structures and further regulating electronic structures of their derived (oxy)hydroxides for boosting OER performance remain great challenges. Herein, we report hollow Ni-Co-Fe phosphide (Ni-Co-Fe-P) nanoboxes with well-defined interior spaces via a core-shell Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-dependent conversion. Starting from Ni-Co PBA nanocubes, a chemical reduction and decomposition process is utilized to fabricate core-shell Ni-Co@Fe PBA nanocubes based on the lattice matching principle, which are then phosphatized into hollow Ni-Co-Fe-P nanoboxes through an interface-induced contraction process. Thanks to well-designed hollow structures, polymetallic compositions, and doping of carbon, hollow Ni-Co-Fe-P nanobox catalyst shows a remarkable OER activity with a small overpotential of 277 mV at 20 mA cm(-2). Notably, this catalyst is also highly stable with only 5 % activity decay over 24 h for the OER. Mechanism studies reveal that the electronic regulation of precatalyst-derived (oxy)hydroxides is the key to boost their OER activity. This work demonstrates a novel and effective protocol for designing polymetallic phosphides with well-defined hollow structures towards various targeted applications.

TI Self-Assembly Mechanism of Nanoparticles of Ni-Based Prussian Blue
   Analogues at the Air/Liquid Interface: A Synchrotron X-ray Reflectivity
   Study
SO CHEMPHYSCHEM
AB Prussian Blue analogue (PBA) nanoparticles can be self-assembled at air/liquid interfaces to build novel materials with interesting magnetic features. Herein, we study the influence of the size of PBA Cs0.4Ni[Cr(CN)(6)](0.9) and K0.25Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.75) nanoparticles on the self-assembly behavior by synchrotron X-ray reflectivity. Both nanoparticles show similar Z-potential values. The phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and the amino surfactant dimethyldioctadecylammonium have been used as Langmuir monolayers to anchor the PBA nanoparticles and study the interplay of forces directing the self-assembly of the nanoparticles at the surfactant/liquid interface. Whereas Cs0.4Ni[Cr(CN)(6)](0.9) nanoparticles with a diameter of 8 nm form an incomplete layer at the surfactant/water interface, the larger K0.25Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.75) nanoparticles with a diameter of 20 nm generate complete layers that can be stacked to one another. The size of the PBA nanoparticles is the main parameter determining the final arrangement at the air/liquid interface, due to the different extent of interparticle interaction. This study aims at the rationale design of PBA nanoparticles for an effective interfacial self-assembly, ultimately leading to functional materials.

TI A core-shell heterostructured CuFe@NiFe Prussian blue analogue as a
   novel electrode material for high-capacity and stable capacitive
   deionization
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have recently been proposed as electrode materials for efficient capacitive deionization (CDI). However, there is a conflict between the desalination capacity and stability for singlecomponent bimetallic PBAs, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high desalination capacity and recyclability. To overcome this limitation, this study made an attempt to synthesize the core@ shell heterostructured CuFe@ NiFe PBA by enclosing a high-capacity CuFe PBA with the stable NiFe PBA shell. The desalination tests showed that the CuFe@ NiFe PBA had a higher desalination capacity with less energy consumption compared with the sole core material, associated with the more rapid intercalation reactions of Na ions due to the unique core-shell heterostructure. Furthermore, the recyclability of the CuFe@ NiFe PBA was improved significantly, attributed to the protective effect of the NiFe PBA against the irreversible structural change of the CuFe PBA during the long-term operation. The electrochemical and material measurements revealed that the desalination and regeneration processes were governed by the redox of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple and Cu2+/Cu+ couple while the Ni3+/Ni2+ couple was electrochemically inactive for the CuFe@ NiFe PBA. Consequently, the core-shell heterostructured CuFe@ NiFe PBA would be a promising material for application in a CDI system.

TI Heterogeneous interface of Ni-Mn composite Prussian blue analog-coated
   structure modulates the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides in
   lithium-sulfur batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Capacity reduction mainly caused by the shuttle effect and low conductivity restricts the commercial application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). In this work, a nickel-compound manganese Prussian blue analog-coated polypyrrole composite sulfur electrode material (3-MnNi-PBA@S@PPy) was synthesized. The composite 3-MnNi-PBA@S@PPy has strong chemisorptions to polysulfides (LiPSs) and excellent catalytic activity, which can anchor LiPSs and accelerate their conversion. The surface 3-MnNi-PBA in the 3-MnNi-PBA@S@PPy structure spontaneously reacts with polysulfides to form heterogeneous intermediate phase thiosulfate salts, which can accelerate the conversion of polysulfides. On the basis of the above advantages, 3-MnNi-PBA@S@PPy com-posites were used as cathodes for LSBs. A high initial capacity of 1285 mAh/g and excellent cycling stability were harvested at a current density of 0.1 C, and the decay rate was only 0.07% per cycle at a high current density of 0.5 C and 500 cycles. The MnNi-PBA material possesses a unique heterogeneous interface catalytic mechanism and effectively suppresses the shuttle effect of LSBs, which has a huge potential application prospect.

TI NMR Spectroscopy for Proof-of-Concept Experimentation on a Polarized
   Laser Fusion Process
SO FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A test experiment to polarize tritium nuclei to develop a polarized deuterium-tritium (D-T) laser fusion concept is proposed in which a ferromagnetic complex with a high internal magnetic field is used to polarize tritium nuclei on physisorbed D-T molecules with an internal beta-decay heat load in a D-T target. Heteronuclear hydrogen deuteride (HD) is used to conduct the measurements herein instead of as in typical D-T-based experiments. As proof-of-concept experimentation, the adsorption and desorption characteristics of HD are examined on Prussian blue ferromagnetic analogue Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) at temperatures of 77 K and around 23 K. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the ferromagnetic complex-mediated adsorption of HD onto activated carbon pellets at 10 K is conducted step by step using a multilocular probe cell that had been simplified to give a single-tube probe cell. The resulting H-1 NMR spectra are compared with F-19 NMR spectra obtained for reference on a Kel-F probe cell wall. Slight differences between the calculated NMR frequency from the gyromagnetic ratio and the actually observed NMR frequency are also discussed.

TI Ambient Synthesis of Vanadium-Based Prussian Blue Analogues Nanocubes
   for High-Performance and Durable Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries with
   Eutectic Electrolytes
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) due to the characteristics of large specific surface area, open aperture, and straightforward synthesis. In this work, vanadium-based PBA nanocubes were firstly prepared using a mild in situ conversion strategy at room temperature without the protection of noble gas. Benefiting from the multiple-redox active sites of V3+/V4+, V4+/V5+, and Fe2+/Fe3+, the cathode exhibited an excellent discharge specific capacity of 200 mAh g-1 in AZIBs, which is much higher than those of other metal-based PBAs nanocubes. To further improve the long-term cycling stability of the V-PBA cathode, a high concentration water-in-salt electrolyte (4.5 M ZnSO4+3 M Zn(OTf)2), and a water-based eutectic electrolyte (5.55 M glucose+3 M Zn(OTf)2) were designed to successfully inhibit the dissolution of vanadium and improve the deposition of Zn2+ onto the zinc anode. More importantly, the assembled AZIBs maintained 55 % of their highest discharge specific capacity even after 10000 cycles at 10 A g-1 with superior rate capability. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction for enhancing the long-term cycling stability of PBA-based AZIBs at high current densities for industrialization prospects.

TI MXene@PBA heterostructures via end-group-directed self-assembly strategy
   for effective inhibition of shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur - sulfur
   batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has been hindered by the shuttle effect and slow sluggish conversion kinetics. This study developed MXene and Prussian blue analogue (PBA) heterostructures using an end-group-directed self-assembly strategy. MXene@PBA heterostructures were synthesized through layer-by-layer stacking and in situ growth of Mn-PBA, driven by the electrostatic interactions between Mn2+ and the polar terminal groups of MXene. The dual-metal synergistic adsorption of Mn2+ and Fe3+ within PBA framework significantly enhances both the adsorption capacity and cycling stability of the composite. Furthermore, the in-situ growth of PBA not only reinforces the structural integrity but also increases the number of active sites, mitigates the collapse of the accordion-like layered structure, alleviates volume expansion, and accelerates rapid ion diffusion. Theoretical calculations confirm the composite's superior adsorption capacity for Li polysulfides (LiPSs). As a S host, MXene@PBA facilitates the solid-liquid phase transformation of polysulfides, improving reaction kinetics and delivering exceptional electrochemical performance. MXene@PBA composite exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1220 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. Its cycle stability is equally remarkable, with a minimal decay rate of 0.062 % per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. The construction of these layered heterostructures as S hosts presents an effective strategy to mitigate the shuttle effect and enhance the reaction kinetics of LSBs.

TI Co-intercalation of Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> and Na<SUP>+</SUP> in
   Na0.69Fe2(CN)6 as a High-Voltage
   Cathode for Magnesium Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Thanks to the advantages of low cost and good safety, magnesium metal batteries get the limelight as substituent for lithium ion batteries. However, the energy density of state-of-the-art magnesium batteries is not high enough because of their low operating potential; thus, it is necessary to improve the energy density by developing new high-voltage cathode materials. In this study, nanosized Berlin green Fe-2(CN)(6) and Prussian blue Na0.69Fe2(CN)(6) are compared as high-voltage cathode materials for magnesium batteries. Interestingly, while Mg2+ ions cannot be intercalated in Fe-2(CN)(6), Na0.69Fe2(CN)(6) shows reversible intercalation and deintercalation of Mg2+ ions, although they have the same crystal structure except for the presence of Na+ ions. This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that Mg2+ ions are more stable in Nat-containing Na0.69Fe2(CN)(6) than in Na+-free Fe-2(CN)(6), indicating Nat ions in Na0.69Fe2(CN)(6) plays a crucial role in stabilizing Mg2+ ions. Na0.69Fe2(CN)(6) delivers reversible capacity of approximately 70 mA h g(-1) at 3.0 V vs Mg/Mg2+ and shows stable cyde performance over 35 cycles. Therefore, Prussian blue analogues are promising structures for high-voltage cathode materials in Mg batteries. Furthermore, this co-intercalation effect suggests new avenues for the development of cathode materials in hybrid magnesium batteries that use both Mg2+ and Na+ ions as charge carriers.

TI Prussian blue analog-derived 2D ultrathin CoFe2O4
   nanosheets as high-activity electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution
   reaction in alkaline and neutral media
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Developing highly efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is of vital importance for large-scale energy storage and conversion technologies. Herein, we report a simple and facile strategy to synthesize 2D ultrathin CoFe2O4 nanosheets (NSs) with abundant oxygen vacancies by the reduction of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) at room temperature using NaBH4. With large surface area, high density of surface-active sites, high electron transfer capability and durability, CoFe2O4 NSs show a low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 42.1 mV dec(-1) for the OER in alkaline medium, which is superior to that of the benchmark RuO2. What's more, CoFe2O4 NSs also exhibit a high catalytic activity for the OER with a low onset potential of 1.505 V and a high current density of 4.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V in neutral medium. Both the oxygen vacancies and the synergistic effect between oxygen vacancies and Co3+ contribute to the excellent OER activity of CoFe2O4 NSs. Our finding opens up a new general route for developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for the OER.

TI Development of
   Co3[Co(CN)6]2/Fe3O4</su
   b> Bifunctional Nanocomposite for Clinical Sensor Applications
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB In this study, a magnetically separable three-dimensional (3D) Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)/Fe3O4 nanocomposite comprising magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) adsorbed on the nanocubes of a cobalt Prussian blue analogue was prepared. The nanocomposite exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance in Co2+/Co3+ conversion, while the superparamagnetic behavior of the magnetite NPs was preserved even after adsorption on the nanocubes. Increased Faradaic currents were observed in the cyclic voltammograms (CV) for Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)/Fe3O4 in comparison with the CV of isolated Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2). This increase was attributed to supramolecular charge transfer between the cobalt Prussian blue analogue and the magnetic NPs and the larger amount of electroactive species on the electrode. Transmission electron microscopy images showed well-defined Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanocubes that had edge lengths of 21-140 nm and were decorated with spherical magnetite NPs less than 10 nm in diameter. Interestingly, an intimate contact between the nanocubes and aggregate formation was avoided by Fe3O4 NPs. The composition, morphology, and surface properties of the nanohybrid material were assessed by UVvis absorption spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area. The analytical results of nanocomposite showed main bands, crystalline phases, and structures associated with Fe3O4 and Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2). The bifunctional properties of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)/Fe3O4 are potentially useful for building novel (bio)sensors and magnetic devices for clinical applications.

TI Sodium-rich prussian blue analogue coated by
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate as superior
   cathode for sodium-ion batteries
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising alternative to complement costly lithium-ion batteries for grid-scale stationary energy storage systems. However, finding a suitable cathode material has been a challenging process mainly due to the large radius of sodium-ion that hinders the process of intercalation. In our previous work, we have successfully synthesized Prussian blue analogue (PBA) via simple single iron source precipitation and low thermal method. However, it suffered poor electrical conductivity. In this work, the as-prepared PBA (high purity, low vacancy (similar to 2%), and high sodium-ion content) was then coated with various concentrations of conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT-PSS) via simple stirring method to aid the electron route. The coated PBA (PB-P5) demonstrates two-fold enhanced conductivity of 2.04 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) at 30 degrees C and 1.18 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 100 degrees C. XRD peaks of coated PBAs show a slight shifting to higher diffraction angle, indicating the changes from rhombohedral-like to cubic structure. The battery capacity retention has also improved from 73.9% (PB-P0) to 82.87% (PB-P5), on account of having PEDOT-PSS to slow down the side reaction between cathode and electrolyte and eventually improve the cycling stability. Additionally, PB-P5 displays the lowest potential separation in cyclic voltammetry (CV) and small charge transfer resistance, R-ct value, in which indicating a better electron transfer and enhanced overall conductivity.

TI Heterogeneous degradation of carbamazepine by Prussian blue analogues in
   the interlayers of layered double hydroxides: performance, mechanism and
   toxicity evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are efficient catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. However, the longevity and recovery ability of PBA are very poor, which limits their practical applications. In this study, for the first time, we successfully incorporated a nanosheet-like PBA into the interlayers of layered double hydroxides (LDH) (PBA-LDH). The morphology and physicochemical characteristics of the as-synthesized PBA-LDH were well characterized using SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR and XPS. PMS activation via PBA-LDH toward carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation was systematically examined. The activation of PMS via PBA alone could only achieve a maximum of 31.8% degradation efficiency for CBZ within 15min. However, complete degradation of CBZ was achieved via a PBA-LDH-activated PMS system within a wide pH range of 3.0 to 9.0. ESR measurements and radical scavenging experimental results revealed that SO4- is the most active species in CBZ degradation. XPS analysis confirmed a reversible valence equilibrium between the metal ions and the recovery of surface-adsorbed oxygen, ensuring stable catalytic activity. Notably, the CBZ degradation in the PBA-LDH activated system remained as high as 95.7% after six consecutive runs. Meanwhile, only 8.1 g L-1 cobalt ion and 5.4 g L-1 iron ion were leached from PBA-LDH after the degradation reaction; thus, it is non-toxic to aqueous environments. In addition, a possible pathway for CBZ degradation was proposed, and an eco-toxicity assessment of the oxidation intermediates was also performed.

TI Directly Converting CO2 to Light Hydrocarbons on a FeCoAl
   Prussian Blue Analogue-Based Core-Shell Catalyst via Fischer-Tropsch
   Synthesis
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB Here, we report a unique porous FeCoAl Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-based core-shell catalyst (Na/Fe@FeCoAlP) with a well-defined spatial arrangement of double-active interfaces for superior CO2 conversion to C-2-C(4 )hydrocarbons. Compared to the traditional Na/Fe catalyst, which has a selectivity of 32.0% to C-2-C-4  hydrocarbons at a CO2 conversion of 38.1%, the resulting Na/Fe@FeCoAl-P-0.1 catalyst exhibits significantly improved selectivity (40.8%) to C-2-C(4 )hydrocarbons with a high olefin/paraffin (O/P) ratio of 8.7 at a largely improved CO2 conversion of 54% at 330 degrees C, while the CO selectivity decreases from 7.3 to 3.5%. Furthermore, the selectivity of C-2-C-4  hydrocarbons can reach 45.7% containing 38.7% of C-2(=)-C(4)(= )products at 280 degrees C. In addition, the in-depth characterization results have indicated that the presence of FeCoAl PBA not only inhibits the generation of heavy hydrocarbons by the unique porous structure space but also considerably facilitates the formation of an abundant Fe5C2 phase for boosting Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) activity. Also, a distinctive reaction scheme of CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons over the Na/Fe@FeCoAl-P-0.1 catalyst is proposed on the basis of extensive characterizations. Moreover, we also demonstrate that porous-structured PBA is a highly promising material for use in CO2 hydrogenation, although its application has been rarely reported in CO2 Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

TI Nickel Hexacyanoferrate as Cathode for Sodium-Ion Batteries: Effects of
   the Synthesis Conditions on the Material Properties
SO BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS
AB The increment in the energy demand and the limited availability of materials for manufacturing large-scale energy storage batteries based on Li-ion chemistry has increased the study of alternative technologies, including Na-ion batteries. The quest for superior electrochemical performances has led to the development new cathodes, such as Prussian blue and its analogs. Among the different members of this family of materials, KNi[Fe(CN)6] has attracted great attraction because of its low synthesis cost and excellent stability. Multiple synthesis approaches based on coprecipitation methods have been explored to optimize its capacity to intercalate sodium; however, the effects of the synthesis conditions on the structural and electrochemical properties of KNi[Fe(CN)6] remain vague. Therefore, in this work, we propose a detailed analysis of how the main synthesis parameters define the structural and electrochemical properties of KNi[Fe(CN)6].

TI Structural and defect modulations of co-precipitation synthesized
   high-entropy Prussian blue analogue nanocubes via Cu/Zn co-doping
   for enhanced electrochemical performance
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Exploration and development of advanced materials with desired electrochemical performance is highly needed for supercapacitors and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For this, we have investigated ternary-, quinary-, and quaternary-metal (or high-entropy) Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes prepared via a one-step co-precipitation method. The metals involved include Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, and Zn. The particle size, hexacyanoferrate vacancy content, specific surface area, electrical conductivity, and electronic structure are varied by manipulating the number of metals used. The effects of Cu and Zn additions are addressed. We found that Cu-doping effectively boosts the electrical conductivity, Zn-doping modulates the formation of hexacyanoferrate vacancies, and Cu/Zn co-doping tunes the particle size and specific surface area. High-entropy PBAs exhibiting a specific capacity of 44.8 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and high cycling stability for supercapacitor application, and a low overpotential of 242 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and an excellent 60 h stability with negligible potential decline for OER application are demonstrated.

TI A Low-Temperature Hydrothermal Synthesis of Prussian Blue Nanocrystal
   and Its Application in H2O2 Detection
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Uniform Prussian blue Fe-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) nanocrystals were synthesized by a direct dissociation and reduction of the single-Fe(III)-source precursor K3Fe(CN)(6) under low-temperature hydrothermal conditions. UV-visible absorption spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectrum, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectra, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical testing were used to characterize and verify the synthesized Prussian blue nanocrystal product. The size of the synthesized product had a strong dependence on the acidity condition and the concentration of K3Fe(CN)(6) solution. This result may facilitate not only the exploration of preparing Fe-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) nanocrystals for particular applications but also an in-depth explanation of the nature of the hydrothermal reaction. The Prussian blue nanocrystals were deposited onto an electrode support through lyotropic liquid crystalline templates to detect hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by reduction reaction. Cyclic voltammograms showed that the Prussian blue modified electrode was of excellent electrocatalytic activity for H2O2. This electrode demonstrated a detection limit (1 x 10(-7) M) and a linear range starting from the detection limit and extending over 6 orders of magnitude of H2O2 concentrations (1 x 10(-7) to 1 x 10(-1) M), which was of excellent performance in detecting H2O2.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Stabilization of ions in exotic oxidation states is beneficial for the development of new materials for green energy technologies. Exotic Mn1+ was proposed to play a role in the function of sodium-based Prussian blue analogues (PBA) batteries, a highly sought-out technology for industrial energy storage. Here, we report the detailed electronic structure characterization of uncharged and charged sodium-based manganese hexacyano-manganate anodes via Mn K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), K beta nonresonant X-ray emission (XES), and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). The latter allowed us to obtain site-selective XANES information about two distinct Mn centers. The obtained spectroscopic data represent the first electronic structure characterization of low-spin Mn1+ using hard X-ray RIXS and XES and allowed us to confirm its role in anode reduction. Our experimental approach can be expanded to analysis of analogues with other 3d transition metals broadening the application of exotic ionic states in materials engineering.

AB In this study, we have synthesized Prussian blue analogue nanocrystals of copper hexacyanocobaltate (CuHCC), and their derivatives via a facile stepwise encapsulation of 1,3-diaza-2,4-cyclopentadiene (Im; Im@CuHCC) and acetic acid (HAc; Im-HAc@CuHCC) into the CuHCC framework. These materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, infrared spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption/desorption and scanning electron microscopy. Im-HAc@CuHCC shows humidity dependent proton conduction with conductivity (sigma) in the 0.933-8.55 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) range at 98% relative humidity (RH) while sigma approximate to 10(-6)-10(-5) S cm(-1) at 25% RH in the 298-353 K range. We further prepared and characterized a series of composites of Im-HAc@CuHCC with a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel, labeled Im-HAc@CuHCC-PVA-X (X = 0, 2, 5 and 10%, and represents the mass ratio of Im-HAc@CuHCC and the hydrogel). Regarding PVA hydrogel, the tensile strength of composites is enhanced at least 1.5 times. Importantly, the X = 10% composite shows superior proton conduction with sigma = 0.81-6.5 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 25% RH in the 298-353 K range, confirming that the formation of the hydrogel composite is a facile but efficient strategy to enhance the water-retention capacity and proton conduction at low humidity for porous proton conductors.

   Theory
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian blue and its related compounds are formed by cheap and abundant metals and have shown their importance in the generation of new fuels by renewable sources. To optimize these compounds it is important to understand their electronic structure and thus establish robust structureactivity relationships. To this end, we employed theoretical simulations based on density functional theory, employing functionals of different degree of complexity, including pure generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA+U functionals, which introduce self-interaction correction terms through the Hubbard parameter, and compared those to the hybrid functionals HSE03 and HSE06. With this robust setup, we can identify an appropriate computational scheme that provides the best compromise between computational demand and accuracy. A complete database considering Berlin green and Prussian blue and white for all alkaline cations is presented.

TI Hollow Layered Iron-Based Prussian Blue Cathode with Reduced Defects for
   High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Fe-based Prussian blue (Fe-PB) analogues have emerged as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, owing to their cost-effectiveness, high theoretical capacity, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical application is hindered by [Fe(CN)(6)] defects, negatively impacting capacity and cycle stability. This work reports a hollow layered Fe-PB composite material using 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTA) as a chelating and etching agent by the hydrothermal method. Compared to benzoic acid, our approach significantly reduces defects and enhances the yield of Fe-PB. Notably, the hollow layered structure shortens the diffusion path of sodium ions, enhances the activity of low-spin Fe in the Fe-PB lattice, and mitigates volume changes during Na-ion insertion/extraction into/from Fe-PB. As a sodium-ion battery cathode, this hollow layered Fe-PB exhibits an impressive initial capacity of 95.9 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 1 A g(-1). Even after 500 cycles, it still maintains a considerable discharge capacity of 73.1 mAh g(-1), showing a significantly lower capacity decay rate (0.048%) compared to the control sample (0.089%). Moreover, the full cell with BTA-PB-1.6 as the cathode and HC as the anode provides a considerable energy density of 312.2 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 291.0 W kg(-1). This research not only enhances the Na storage performance of Fe-PB but also increases the yield of products obtained by hydrothermal methods, providing some technical reference for the production of PB materials using the low-yield hydrothermal method.

TI One-pot hydrothermal synthesis of Co-Ni hexacyanoferrate nanocuboids on
   Ni-foam as efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution and urea oxidation
   reactions
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB Recently, considerable research has been conducted on Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), a type of metal-organic framework (MOF) material, as novel electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and urea oxidation reactions (UORs). In the present work, considering Co-Ni hexacyanoferrate (CoxNi1-xHCF) as a PBA, CoxNi1-xHCF nanocuboids with different Co and Ni compositions were synthesized on Ni foam (NF) by hydrothermal synthesis. Further, their application toward OER and UOR catalytic activity was studied. The synthesized CoxNi1-xHCF:NF composites with high catalytic activity and conductivity exhibited superior catalytic performance for the OERs and UORs. The CoxNi1-xHCF:NF composite electrodes exhibited a lower overpotential (eta) of 334 mV with a lower Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) for the OER catalytic activity and a lower potential of 1.38 V with a lower Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) for the UOR catalytic activity. It was observed that low charge transfer resistance, high electrochemically active surface area, and availability of Co3+ ions are major factors contributing to the OER activity. The presence of oxidative Ni2+ species contributed significantly to the UOR activity. Overall, the present study elucidates the binder-free CoxNi1-xHCF:NF electrodes as stable and high-performance OER and UOR catalysts and provides pathways for designing advanced PBA catalysts.

TI A review on recent advances in Prussian blue, its analogues, and their
   derived materials as electrodes for high performance supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Supercapacitors (SCs) have gained much attention as an environmentally friendly and efficient energy storage system, especially for high-power applications. Among the various electrode materials, Prussian blue, and its analogues (PB/PBAs) have gained prominence due to their tunable chemical composition and open framework structure. PB/PBAs have been used as an electrode material in their natural state and used to fabricate diverse metal heterostructures for energy storage devices. These materials offer advantages such as simplicity of fabrication, non-toxicity, and cost-effectiveness. Because of their unique compositions, PB/PBAs usually contain two or more kinds of metallic elements, and the synergistic effect between the different metallic elements provides more possibilities for their application in the field of SCs. After easy treatment of PB/PBAs, derived materials, such as transition-metal carbide, transition-metal oxide, transition-metal selenide, transition-metal sulfide, and so forth can be obtained. Due to the particularity of PBA composition, these derived materials are usually bimetallic or polymetallic. These derivatives not only inherit the structural advantages of PB/PBAs, but also usually solve the problem of poor conductivity of PB/PBAs. Therefore, derived materials can show more excellent electrochemical performance. In recent years, the preparation and electrochemical application of PB/ PBAs and their derivatives have attracted increased attention. In this article, the synthesis strategies of PB/PBAs and their derived materials are systematically summarized. The applications of related materials in the field of SCs are introduced in detail. And the prospects and challenges are further analyzed.

TI Reconfiguring the Hydrogen Networks of Aqueous Electrolyte to Stabilize
   Iron Hexacyanoferrate for High-Voltage pH-Decoupled Cell
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising insertion-type cathode materials for different types of aqueous batteries, capable of accommodating metal or non-metal ions. However, their practical application is hindered by their susceptibility to dissolution, which leads to a shortened lifespan. Herein, we have revealed that the dissolution of PBAs primarily originates from the locally elevated pH of electrolytes, which is caused by the proton co-insertion during discharge. To address this issue, the water-locking strategy has been implemented, which interrupts the generation and Grotthuss diffusion of protons by breaking the well-connected hydrogen bonding network in aqueous electrolytes. As a result, the hybrid electrolyte enables the iron hexacyanoferrate to endure over 1000 cycles at a 1 C rate and supports a high-voltage pH-decoupled cell with an average voltage of 1.95 V. These findings provide insights for mitigating the dissolution of electrode materials, thereby enhancing the viability and performance of aqueous batteries.
   Proton insertion-induced local pH increase leads to PBA dissolution. Our strategy locks water molecules to disrupt the proton diffusion's hydrogen bond network, inhibit the proton insertion, and stabilize electrode pH, consequently ensuring stable PBA cathode cycling. image

TI Inhibiting the Jahn-Teller Effect of Manganese Hexacyanoferrate via Ni
   and Cu Codoping for Advanced Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Manganese (Mn)-based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are of great interest as a prospective cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high redox potential, easy synthesis, and low cost. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and low electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA cause poor structure stability and unsatisfactory performance during the cycling. Herein, a novel nickel- and copper-codoped K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode is developed via a simple coprecipitation strategy. The doping elements improve the electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA by reducing the bandgap, as well as suppress the Jahn-Teller effect by stabilizing the framework, as verified by the density functional theory calculations. Simultaneously, the substitution of sodium with potassium in the lattice is beneficial for filling vacancies in the PBA framework, leading to higher average operating voltages and superior structural stability. As a result, the as-prepared Mn-based cathode exhibits excellent reversible capacity (116.0 mAh g-1 at 0.01 A g-1) and superior cycling stability (81.8% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1). This work provides a profitable doping strategy to inhibit the Jahn-Teller structural deformation for designing stable cathode material of SIBs.
   The nickel- and copper-doped manganese-based Prussian blue cathode undergoes a reversible phase transition from monoclinic to cubic phase during the charge and discharge process, which exhibits excellent cycling stability as cathode for sodium-ion batteries. image

TI Unlocking the structure and cation synergistic modulation of Prussian
   blue analogues with double redox mechanism for improved aqueous
   nonmetallic ion storage
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) exhibit high energy density and a good electrochemical stability window in aqueous non-metallic ion batteries, which is conducive to achieving high energy output and stable operation. Additionally, their synthesis process is simple and environmentally friendly, meeting the demands of sustainable development. However, the poor conductivity, structural stability issues, and inadequate ion diffusion pathways limit their application in batteries. To overcome these challenges, researchers have adopted various optimization strategies: enhancing the conductivity of PBAs by compositing with high-conductivity carbon materials such as graphite, carbon nanotubes, or graphene; optimizing synthesis conditions such as temperature and reaction time to improve the defect and structural water content of PBAs, thereby enhancing their stability and electrochemical performance; employing surface modification techniques, such as conductive polymer encapsulation and acid etching, to improve their electrochemical stability and ion transport performance; and optimizing ion diffusion efficiency and battery kinetics by selecting suitable electrolytes and additives. These comprehensive measures contribute to improving the electrochemical performance of PBAs and promoting the development of their commercial applications. Based on prior research advancements, we introduce a novel synergistic regulation strategy: the creation of multi-redox-active centers to augment the transport capability of non-metallic ions and the optimization of defect structures through the establishment of a metal ion concentration gradient, thereby enhancing both electrochemical stability and performance.
   The performance of aqueous non-metallic ion batteries can be enhanced by constructing multi-active site PBAs through the synergistic regulation of structure and ions.

TI Prussian Blue Iron-Cobalt Mesocrystals as a Template for the Growth of
   Fe/Co Carbide (Cementite) and Fe/Co Nanocrystals
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Controlling the composition, size, and morphology of transition-metal carbides and metals is important for product selectivity in industrial catalytic processes, such as in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). The formation of iron- cobalt carbide nanocatalysts can enhance selectivity in the FTS process if the iron to cobalt ratios are controlled. Unfortunately, this is difficult to achieve in nanocrystals due to ion migration, differences in formation rates, and the requirement of perfect critical nuclei to form prior to the growth of the nanocrystal in colloidal synthesis. In this manuscript, a mixed metal iron-cobalt Prussian blue analogue (PBA) mesocrystal is shown to act as a template for isolating pure phase iron-cobalt carbide and iron-cobalt alloy nanocrystals. The formation of the individual nanocrystals from the heterometallic mesocrystal occurs through sequential decomposition and recrystallization events. The steps in the interconversion are observed by in situ and ex situ analytical techniques allowing a mechanism for carbide and metal formation to be proposed. The synthetic route is scalable and likely to be extendable to a wider range of bimetallic materials using the diverse range of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) reported in the literature.

TI Oxygen plasma functionalization of hexacyanocobaltates for high-capacity
   supercapacitor electrodes
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Supercapacitors have attracted much attention because of their unique advantages. Electrode materials, as one of the most important parts, have already been the focus of research. A great effort has been made to address the drawback of low capacity, for example, annealing, forming compound and doping. However, these methods have not brought significant improvement of capacity. Here, we develop a facile method for enhancing the specific capacity of cobalt hexacyanocobalte using oxygen plasma etching. The specific capacity of the engraved sample increased by 62.15% (from 214.0C g(-1) to 347.0C g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1)). The excellent capacitive performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of increasing K+ diffusion velocity, exposing more active sites and promoting hydrophilicity. This method may be extended to dramatically improve the specific capacity of Prussian blue, its analogs and even other metal-organic frameworks materials.

TI Prussian blue-graphene oxide composite cathode for a sodium-ion
   capacitor with improved cyclic stability and energy density
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB For applications involving sodium-ion capacitor (SIC) with high energy and high power, it is necessary to develop cathode materials with high operating voltage, high capacity, and excellent cyclic stability. Prussian blue and its analogs are considered promising candidates for cathode materials owing to their high energy and high stability resulting from their open framework structure. We demonstrate that the Prussian blue-graphene oxide composite (PBGO) can be applied to SIC as a battery-type cathode. PBGO is synthesized by a single-step decomposition method and has a morphology in which graphene oxide covered Prussian blue, which has a uniform cubic structure. PBGO exhibit a high capacity of 165 mAh g(-1) at 20 mA g(-1), as well as 68 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 4 A g(-1). The SIC is fabricated using PBGO as the cathode materials and activated carbon (AC) as a capacitor-type anode, and it exhibit a high specific energy density of 65.3 Wh kg(-1) and a superior capacity retention of 78.8% after 10,000 cycles. The use of battery-type cathodes presents a promising strategy for developing SIC with high energy and long lifespan. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Superhydrophilic, underwater superoleophobic and self-cleaning nickel
   composite mesh via simultaneous acid etching and in-situ growth of
   Prussian blue analogue for oil-water separation
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Nowadays, water is a growing challenge for all countries. Remarkably, water pollution caused by the oil spill has been the major environmental issue, which seriously threatens ecological balance. Therefore, it is very important to search some available materials prepared through simple methods for treatment of oily wastewater. Here, a kind of superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic Fe(III)-CMC@PBA@Ni mesh was successfully prepared through in-situ growth and coating sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na), which achieved simultaneous acid etching and in-situ growth of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) on the surface of Ni mesh. This modification method not only simplified the preparation process but also built an ideal ordered structure on the surface of Ni mesh. Meanwhile, this composite Ni mesh displayed high water flux of 180,000 L m- 2 h-1 with an efficiency of more than 99.0% under gravitational force. At the same time, Fe(III)-CMC@PBA@Ni mesh presented outstanding self-cleaning performance for methylene blue (MB) degradation in wastewater. Moreover, the composite mesh exhibited outstanding stability, durability, acid-alkaline resistance, and salt resistance, which showed the potential application value in practical oil-water separation.

TI Decoupling Degradation at the Electrode Interfaces in Prussian White
   Full Cells
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues for sodium-ion battery cathodes are growing in popularity as next-generation energy storage devices. Prussian White (PW) with formula NaxFe[Fe(CN)6]y center dot nH2O is leading the trend, having already been commercialized. However, capacity fade (PW/electrolyte degradation) and safety concerns (cyanide/cyanogen release) still raise concerns. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry, supported by both operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and M & ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy, is herein used to analyze degradation processes in PW-based Na-ion full cells. Apart from the typical cell formation reactions, hydrogen is observed to evolve during cell discharge and evidenced to stem from oxidation of NaH, accumulated upon charge. Over-oxidation of PW after full desodiation releases CN, which not only forms (CN)2 but also degrades the electrolyte. Loss of CN likely results in a nanometric (approximate to 4 nm) surface-reconstructed passivation layer on PW, thus inhibiting further degradation. Fundamental understanding of degradation reactions in PW full-cells, as gathered herein, shows that the aforementioned capacity fade and safety concerns are wholly addressable and hence guides the further development of Na-ion batteries for wider ranges of applications.

SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) with general formula NaxMA[M-B(CN)(6)](y)center dot z H2O (M-A, M-B = transition metal) are promising low cost, high rate and high capacity cathodes for sodium ion battery (SIB) technology. Here, we have studied the PBA Na1.32Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.83)center dot z H2O (z = 3.0 and 2.2) with varying structural modifications (monoclinic and cubic) using in operando quasi-simultaneous X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). We observed a series of reversible structural phase transitions which accompany Na insertion/extraction during electrochemical cycling. The samples show pronounced differences in their galvanostatic charge and discharge profiles which could be linked to structural and electronic response. Different desodiation and sodiation mechanisms were identified. The influence of [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies and water content on the electrochemical performance was investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Potential Co 2+and Ni 2+intercalation into nickel hexacyanoferrate in
   aqueous media: Study of electrochemical process and multivalent
   batteries implications
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Alternative energy storage systems to lithium -ion batteries that can reduce the dependency on such technology have attracted great interest in recent years. Besides their current limitations, multivalent batteries based on coupling a metallic anode (Mg, Zn, Ca ... ) with a multivalent intercalation cathode are considered as a potential option. Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) have shown promising multivalent intercalation capacities and have also been employed in other scientific fields like wastewater treatment, selective element extraction, and may have a potential applicability in batteries recycling. However, some controversies have recently appeared around the capacity of PBAs to incorporate multivalent cations in aqueous media. In this work, we analyze by a combinatorial approach using structural and electrochemical techniques the potential Ni 2+ and Co 2+ intercalation in K 0.61 Ni[Fe(CN) 6 ] 0.84 square 0.16 . 2 . 12 H 2 O, its limitations, the role of proton intercalation and the cation released after oxidation, which differed from the intercalated during previous reduction step. The potential implications of such findings in current uses of PBAs for multivalent batteries are also discussed.

TI Ni-Fe PBA hollow nanocubes as efficient electrode materials for highly
   sensitive detection of guanine and hydrogen peroxide in human whole
   saliva
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB A sensor for the determination of guanine (G) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is developed based on Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogues hollow nanocubes (Ni-Fe PBA HNCs) for the first time. As a remarkable redox probe towards G and H2O2 oxidation, Ni-Fe PBA HNCs exhibit a series of predominant sensing performances as follows: lower limit of detection, broader linear range and higher selectivity due to the homogeneous hollow structure, high specific surface and the enhanced electron transfer ability of Ni-Fe PBA HNCs. As a G sensor, it exhibits a wide linear range (0.05-4.0 mM) and a low detection limit of 0.0104 mu M (S/N = 3). As a H2O2 sensor, the Ni-Fe PBA HNCs show superior sensing performances with a low detection limit of 0.291 mu M (S/N = 3) and a wide detection range of 0.1-20 mM. By cause of these advantages, the real-time detection of G and H2O2 in human saliva are triumphantly accomplishment, indicating the applicability of Ni-Fe PBA HNCs.

TI High Crystalline Prussian White Nanocubes as a Promising Cathode for
   Sodium-ion Batteries
SO CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) have been recognized as one of the most promising cathode materials for room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report high crystalline and Na-rich Prussian white Na2CoFe(CN)(6) nanocubes synthesized by an optimized and facile co-precipitation method. The influence of crystallinity and sodium content on the electrochemical properties was systematically investigated. The optimized Na2CoFe(CN)(6) nanocubes exhibited an initial capacity of 151mAhg(-1), which is close to its theoretical capacity (170mAhg(-1)). Meanwhile, the Na2CoFe(CN)(6) cathode demonstrated an outstanding long-term cycle performance, retaining 78% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Na2CoFe(CN)(6) Prussian white nanocubes also achieved a superior rate capability (115mAhg(-1) at 400mAg(-1), 92mAhg(-1) at 800mAg(-1)). The enhanced performances could be attributed to the robust crystal structure and rapid transport of Na ions through large channels in the open-framework. Most noteworthy, the as-prepared Na2CoFe(CN)(6) nanocubes are not only low-cost in raw materials but also contain a rich sodium content (1.87Na ions per lattice unit cell), which will be favorable for full cell fabrication and large-scale electric storage applications.

TI Designing of CoP4/FeP4 with hollow nanocages as
   bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Efficient and stable electrocatalysts are essential for water splitting. Feasible structural design can facilitate electron transport and increase specific surface area. Herein, the porous CoP4/FeP4 hollow cubes are synthesized by two steps: synthesizing the Co-Fe prussian blue analogues via co-precipitation and phosphating it by calcination. The construction of heterojunction in CoP4/FeP4 not only accelerates electronic transmission but also provides active sites, which acts synergistically on the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Therefore, the CoP4/FeP4 hollow cubes with the exist of mesoporous exhibit the promising performance for water splitting. The enhanced performance that basically originates from bimetallic synergy and unique morphological structure is acquired with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and the Tafel slope of 42.4 mV dec-1 towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Electrolyzer with two-electrode system assemble by utilizing the CoP4/FeP4 hybrid as anode and cathode exhibits a cell voltage of 1.74 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2 for overall water splitting. This study that provides a simple strategy to design and construct the heterogeneous interface may promote the development of non-noble metal for HER and OER.

TI Imaging Single Prussian Blue Nanoparticles with Extraordinary Low-Spin
   Iron Capacity
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In attempts to obtain high-capacity Prussian blue nanomaterials, current efforts are predominantly focused on the particle-ensemble-level understanding of their structure-activity relationships. Complementarily, it would be insightful to screen out extraordinary individuals from the nanoparticle population. Using a simple and efficient technique of bright-field microscopy, this work enables, for the first time, quantitative characterization of the overall two-redox-center electrochemistry of single Prussian blue nanoparticles many at a time. Quantitative optical voltammograms with little interference from solvent breakdown and non-Faradaic electrode charging/discharging are extracted for each single nanoparticle, revealing clear heterogeneity among them. On this basis, the microscopic method allows a detailed comparative analysis between the two redox-active sites. It is found that while the synthesized nanoparticles show a similar specific capacity of the high-spin (HS-Fe) sites with STD/mean = 30%, most individual nanoparticles exhibit monodispersedly small capacities of the low-spin iron (LS-Fe) sites, only about 1/7 +/- 1 of the HS-Fe capacity. Most importantly, it is discovered that there is always a small fraction (similar to 8%) of the single nanoparticles showing an impressively tripled LS-Fe capacity. Facilitated by optical imaging, the discovery of this easily overlooked extraordinary subpopulation confers alternative opportunities for targeted efforts for material chemists to improve synthesis and material design based on these unusual individuals, which in turn implies the general significance of nanoparticle screening.

TI In-situ growth of Fe-Co Prussian-blue-analog nanocages on
   Ni(OH)2/NF and the derivative electrocatalysts with
   hierarchical cage-on-sheet architectures for efficient water splitting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB To design an efficient and cost-effective electrocatalyst based on Prussian blue and its analogs are a promising choice to realize energy transformation and storage via water-splitting. Herein, a facile and practical method is developed to in-situ grow Fe-Co Prussian-blue-analog (PBA) nanocages with an open hole in each face center on Ni(OH)(2)/NF substrate to form the hierarchical cage-on-plate structure. Furthermore, the Fe-Co PBA nanocages attached to Ni(OH)(2)/NF plates are hydrogenated and nitrogenized into FeCoNi/ NF and FeCoNiN/NF electrodes, respectively. As-prepared electrodes successfully retain the 3D hierarchical micro-nano structures of Fe-Co PBA@Ni(OH)(2)/NF precursor and can be used as a bifunctional water-splitting catalyst for overall water splitting. Compared to FeCoNi/NF, FeCoNiN/NF shows more efficiency and durability in the electrolytic water splitting tests in alkaline media. For the FeCoNiN/NF electrocatalyst, ultralow over potentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are only 56 and 290 mV at current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are 267 and 374 mV at current densities of 50 and 500 mA cm(-2). The FeCoNiN/NF electrode can act both the cathode and the anode for overall water splitting, this electrolyzer only requires a cell voltage of 1.492 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-)2(.) This electrolyzer can stably deliver a viable high current density of 625 mA cm(-2) for 40 h to meet the condition of industrial application. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB Novel types of water-soluble anionic cubic cages, K-4[{Co-III(Me-3-Tacn)}(4) {Fe-II(CN)(6)}(4)] and Na-4 [{Co-III(Me-3-Tacn)}(4){Fe-II(CN)(6)}(4)] (Me-3-Tacn = 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane), were prepared by means of a mechanistically designed self-assembly process between [Co(Me-3 -Tacn)Cl-3] and A(4)[Fe-II(CN)(6)] (M = Na or K), consisting of a rate-limiting outer-sphere redox step, followed by a fast substitution/inner-sphere redox reaction sequence. These compounds show remarkable stability in aqueous solution at different pH ranges, displaying neat protonation processes and reversible oxidation with peroxodisulfate to its neutral {Fe-4(III) Co-4(III)} form. Furthermore, the cages behave as a robust and water-soluble molecular Prussian Blue analogue capable of encapsulating {Na-OH2}(+) pairs and K+ cations in aqueous solution, with the cubic structure of the complex being preserved. Substitution of the {Na-OH2}(+) pairs by K+ is easily accomplished, and the electrochemical properties of the sodium and potassium salts of the new cages have been found to be dramatically dependent on the encapsulated units.

   electrocatalysts for Al-air batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts with low-cost for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of paramount importance for promoting economical and high-performance Al-air batteries. Herein, nitrogen-doped carbon decorated with FeCo nanoparticles catalysts is prepared by a low-cost and facile approach employed Prussian blue analogue and dicyandiamide as precursors. The obtained catalyst exhibits remarkable ORR activity with an onset potential (0.981 V vs. RHE) and a high half-wave potential (0.848 V vs. RHE), as well as superior stability in alkaline conditions. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of electrocatalysts might be resulted from the hierarchical porous structure and synergetic effect between FeCo alloy and N-doped graphitic carbon species. As a demonstration, the optimized catalysts are employed as the cathode catalysts in a Al-air battery, which shows remarkable discharge performance with higher open-circuit voltage of 1.67 V and large power density of 98.62 mW cm(-2) which exceeding commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts (1.65 V, 90.81 mW cm(-2)), and exceptional cycle stability of 40 h (4 cycles). This work will provide a chance to explore scalable advanced catalysts in Al-air battery.

Herein, using a multifunctional nanocomposite containing aCoFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) (AuNPs@CoFePBA) as a sensing substrate, an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunosensorwas developed for the highly sensitive detection of Lp-PLA2. Benefitingfrom the synergistic effect of the PBA and AuNPs, the nanocompositeexhibits excellent peroxidase-like activity and can catalyze the luminol-ECLreaction, amplifying the ECL signal by & SIM;29-fold. Meanwhile,the enlarged specific surface area of the nanocomposite and the presenceof abundant AuNPs allow the immobilization of more antibody proteins,thereby improving the sensing response of the immunosensor. When thetarget Lp-PLA2 is captured by the antibody on the sensor surface,the sensor emits a reduced ECL signal because of the increased massand electron transfer resistance due to the formation of the immunecomplex. Under optimized conditions, the constructed ECL immunosensorexhibits a broad linear range from 1 to 2200 ng/mL and a low detectionlimit of 0.21 ng/mL. Additionally, the ECL immunosensor exhibits highspecificity, stability, and reproducibility. This work provides anew approach to diagnose CHD and broadened the application of thePBA in the field of ECL sensors.

TI Distinctive synthesis of CdS-based photocatalysts based on a Prussian
   blue analog induction strategy for efficient solar-driven water
   splitting applications
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are the oldest artificial cyanide-based coordination polymers similar to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in structure, composition, and physicochemical properties. In this work, a PBA induction strategy was applied to develop Cd-based frameworks and further synthesize CdS-based photocatalytic nanomaterials for improving solar-to-H-2 conversion. First, the PBA induction strategy was used to synthesize Cd-based frameworks including Cd-PBA, MnCd-PBA and ZnCd-PBA. Then, they are converted into CdS-based photocatalysts with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. All the resulting Cd-/CdS-based frameworks show a cube-like structure and morphology. In comparison with previously reported CdS-based nanoparticles, the cube-like CdS-based photocatalysts exhibit some advantageous features for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions with enlarged surface area, promoted visible-light-absorption capability, decreased band-gap energies, and increased reduction reaction driving forces. In addition, the resulting ZnCdS frameworks exhibit more improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance than CdS and MnCdS, and the hydrogen evolution rate is up to 5.5 mmol g(-1) h(-1) using a 5 W LED light with a light-power of about 13.1 mW cm(-2) and 21 mmol g(-1) h(-1) using a 300 W xenon lamp with a light-power of about 510 mW cm(-2). Besides, it achieves a solar-to-H-2 (STH) conversion efficiency of 0.17% and apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 1.08% at 400 nm in a cocatalyst-free system.

TI High-energy-density aqueous sodium-ion batteries enabled by chromium
   hexacycnochromate anodes
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (A-SIBs) are a cost-effective and safe battery candidate for stationary energy storage systems. Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) have been studied as cathode materials in A-SIBs. However, few studies have used PBAs as anode materials because of their small specific capacity and low cell voltages. Herein, we report that chromium hexacycnochromate (CrCr PBA) can serve as an efficient anode material to enable high-performance A-SIBs. CrCr PBA contains Cr ions at two types of sites coordinated by C and N, offering two redox pairs at -0.62/-0.65 V and -0.73/-0.77 V (vs. Ag/AgCl electrode), respectively. X-ray photoelectron and electron energy loss spectroscopic characterizations of CrCr PBA at different charge/discharge stages show that Cr at both types of coordinated sites can efficiently participate in Na+ storage, delivering a high specific capacity of 108.2 mAh g-1 at a discharge rate of 0.5 A g-1. Besides, low redox potentials of CrCr PBA also contribute to a higher battery voltage. Coupled with a manganese hexacyanoferrate cathode in a water-in-salt electrolyte (17 M NaClO4), full coin cells exhibit a high energy density of 81.6 Wh kg- 1 and a high capacity of 52.8 mAh g-1 at an average voltage of 1.55 V. They also display a long-cycle-life with 93.01% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 30C with around 100% Coulombic efficiency. Their performance is one of the best among recently reported A-SIBs. Because of their similar energy storage mechanisms, CrCr PBA may also serve as promising anode materials in other types of aqueous alkaline metal-ion batteries (e.g., lithium-ion battery and potassium-ion battery).

TI Metal ion exchange in Prussian blue analogues: Cu(ii)-exchanged Zn-Co
   PBAs as highly selective catalysts for A<SUP>3</SUP> coupling
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB The occurrence of metal ion exchange in Zn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) and Cu-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) Prussian blue analogues (Zn-Co and Cu-Co PBAs) was demonstrated for the first time. While Cu(ii) ion exchange easily occurs in Zn-Co PBA, the exchange of Cu(ii) atoms in Cu-Co PBA by Zn(ii) proved to be more difficult. At low to medium Cu(ii) loadings, the catalytic activity of the exchanged PBAs for the A(3) coupling reaction of benzaldehyde, piperidine and phenylacetylene was higher than that of the bimetallic PBAs and that of multi metal PBAs of similar composition prepared by co-precipitation. This result showcases the benefits of the ion exchange process as a preparation method of PBA catalysts, since it is believed to lead to the incorporation of the desired metal in a more accessible position for reactant molecules. At higher Cu(ii) loadings, ion exchange with Cu(CH3COO)(2)H2O also resulted in co-incorporation of CH3COO-. This incorporation considerably boosted the catalytic activity of the PBAs by providing a basic function that facilitates the C-H activation of phenylacetylene. The most active of the studied PBAs, catallytically outperforms other Cu(ii) based A(3) coupling catalysts and completely suppresses the activity for the homocoupling of phenylacetylene, even under oxidative conditions. Furthermore, the basicity of the PBAs was investigated in the nitroaldol (Henry) reaction, where a clear effect of the presence of CH3COO- was observed. The CH3COO- containing PBAs exhibited an activity three times higher than the rest of the PBAs. The presence of the basic CH3COO- groups represents the first case of basic functionalization of PBAs.

TI Berlin Green with tunable iron content as ultra-high rate host for
   efficient aqueous ammonium ion storage
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs) because of their low cost and superb theoretical capacity. However, its inherently poor conductivity and structural collapse can significantly limit the enhancement of rate property and cycling stability. In this work, Berlin Green (BG) electrode materials with similar wool-like clusters were constructed by direct precipitation method to accelerate the kinetic, which realizes outstanding cycling stability. Berlin Green with the appropriate amount of iron (BG-2) has a fast ion transport channel, enhanced structure stability, highly reversible insertion/ extraction of NH4+, and fine electrochemical reaction activity. Benefiting from the unique architecture and component, the BG-2 electrode shows an excellent rate performance with a discharge/charge specific capacity of 60.1/59.3 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. Even at 5 A g-1, BG-2 exhibits remarkable cycling stability with an initial discharge capacity of 59.5 mAh g-1 and a capacity retention rate of approximately 76% after 30,000 cycles. The BG-2 reveals exceedingly good electrochemical reversibility during the process of NH4+ (de)insertion. BG materials indicate huge potential as a cathode material for the next generation of high-performance aqueous batteries.

TI NiFeP nanocages Embedded in Melamine Sponge derived nitrogen doped
   porous carbon foam as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB Low-cost transition metal phosphides have received widely attentions in the renewable energy application for their comparable catalytic activities and long-term stability. In this paper, bimetallic phosphide nanocages embedded in porous carbon are synthesized through a simple pyrolysis procedure. Firstly, NiFe Prussian blue analogues (PBA) nanocubes were deposited on melamine sponge and in situ etched into PBA nanocages with ammonia solution. Subsequently, the as-prepared PBA nanocages were calcined with phosphorus sources at 350 degrees C to obtain the final catalysts. Owing to 3D macroporous structure of nitrogen doped carbon substrates derived from melamine sponge, the resulted NiFeP Cage@MS exhibits desirable activities and stability toward the OER in alkaline media. Specifically, only a small overpotential of 290 mV is required at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 46 mV.dec(-1). Facile synthesis method and excellent electrocatalysis of NiFeP Cage@MS make it a good candidate of catalyst in water splitting and metal-air batteries.

TI Mixed cobalt-zinc hexacyanoferrate hollow micro-cubes for a high-voltage
   hybrid supercapacitor
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB The behavior of Prussian Blue Analogs (PBAs) is determined by the external transition metal coordinated to the N-end of the hexacyanoferrate block. Combining transition metal ions allows obtaining a material with improved performance for energy-related applications. A mixed PBA was formed with cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) and ZnHCF. The former has two redox processes and easy modulation of its morphology, while the latter exhibits fast kinetics during the charge transfer. The morphology of the solids was controlled by composition, shaping hollow structures at a high concentration of Co2+ in the PBA. Spectroscopic characterization displayed the change in the charge density at the N-end of the cyanide bridges caused by the polarizing power of Zn2+. XRD showed the formation of more than one crystalline phase. The presence of Co2+ provided larger specific capacity and stability during cycling, while Zn2+ afforded a higher potential and improved rate capability to the solid. The material with the best electrochemical behavior was employed to assemble a hybrid supercapacitor, reaching specific energy of 30 Wh kg(-1) at a power of 450 W kg(-1) and 7 Wh kg(-1) at 5.5 kW kg(-1). Additionally, the device retained 85% of its initial capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles.

TI Porous NiFe-oxide nanocubes derived from prussian blue analogue as
   efficient adsorbents for the removal of toxic metal ions and organic
   dyes
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB A novel porous NiFe-oxide nanocubes (NiFe NCs) binary material was successfully fabricated via a facile and scalable tactic, which involved a morphology-inherited heat treating of Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot xH(2)O prussian blue analogue nanocubes as self-sacrificial templates. Consequently, it was demonstrated that the NiFe NCs consisted of primary nanostructure units and interconnected pores, with an average size of (similar to)80 nm. When employed as adsorbents, the as-prepared NiFe NCs displayed remarkable adsorption capacities for heavy metal ions (232.3 mg g(-1) for As(V) and 350.71 mg g(-1) for Cr(VI)) and organic dyes (284.99 mg g(-1) for XO and 31.97 mg g(-1) for CR at 298 K). The resulting NiFe NCs further revealed efficient regeneration and reusability even after five consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles. The microscopic spectrum analysis demonstrated that the interaction between As(V) and NiFe NCs was mainly ascribed to the metal-oxide bonds (M-O) and hydroxyl groups (-OH), while Cr(VI) adsorption was in conjunction with the reduction reaction of Cr(VI) to Cr(Ill). Furthermore, the adsorption of organic dyes on NiFe NCs depended on the pore structure and molecule sizes of the organic dye molecules. These findings make cost-efficient NiFe NCs materials a powerful candidate for remediating water contaminated with inorganic and organic contaminants.

TI Graphite carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles derived from Prussian
   blue analogs growing on natural loofa as cathode materials for
   rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are attracting increasing attention as a potential energy storage system owing to the abundance of Al sources and high charge density of Al3+. However, suitable cathode materials to further advance high-performing AIBs are unavailable. Therefore, we demonstrated the compatibility of elemental metal nanoparticles (NPs) as cathode materials for AlBs. Three types of metal NPs (Co@C, Fe@C, CoFe@C) were formed by in-situ growing Prussian blue analogs (PBAs, Co[Co(CN)(6)], Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] and Co[Fe(CN)(6)]) on a natural loofa (L) by a room-temperature wet chemical method in aqueous bath, followed by a carbonization process. The employed L effectively formed graphite C-encapsulated metal NPs after heat treatment. The discharge capacity of CoFe@C was superior (372 mAh g(-1)) than others (103 mAh g(-1) for Co@C and 75 mAh g(-1) for Fe@C). The novel design results in CoFe@C with an outstanding long-term charge/discharge cycling performance (over 1,000 cycles) with a Coulombic efficiency of 94.1%. Ex-situ X-ray diffraction study indicates these metal NP capacities are achieved through a solid-state diffusion-limited Al storage process. This novel design for cathode materials is highly significant for the further development of advanced AIBs in the future.

TI Landau theory for non-symmetry-breaking electronic instability coupled
   to symmetry-breaking order parameter applied to Prussian blue analog
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Different types of ordering phenomena may occur during phase transitions, described within the universal framework of the Landau theory through the evolution of one, or several, symmetry-breaking order parameters eta. In addition, many systems undergo phase transitions related to an electronic instability, in the absence of symmetry breaking and eventually described through the evolution of a totally symmetric order parameter q linearly coupled to volume change. Analyzing the coupling of a non-symmetry-breaking electronic instability, responsible for volume strain, to symmetry-breaking phenomena is of importance for many systems in nature and here we show that the symmetry-allowed q eta(2) coupling plays a central role. We use as a case study the rubidium manganese hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue analog, exhibiting phase transitions with hysteresis that may exceed 100 K, and based on intermetallic charge transfer (CT). During the phase transition, the intermetallic CT described through the evolution of q is coupled to cubic-tetragonal ferroelastic symmetry breaking described through the evolution of eta. In this system, the symmetry-breaking and non-symmetry-breaking deformations have similar amplitudes but the large volume strain is mainly due to CT. We analyze both the ferroelastic and the CT features of the phase transition within the frame of the Landau theory, taking into account the q eta(2) coupling, stabilizing concomitant CT, and Jahn-Teller distortion. The results show that the phase transition and its wide thermal hysteresis originate from the coupling between both processes and that the elastic coupling of each order parameter with the volume strain is responsible for the q eta(2) coupling. The phase diagrams obtained with this model are in good qualitative agreement with various experimental findings and apply to diverse families of materials undergoing Mott transition, spin-crossover, neutral-ionic transition, etc., for which isostructural electronic instability driving volume strain can couple to symmetry-breaking or not, create phase transition lines, and drive cooperative phenomena.

TI Prussian Blue: A Safe Pigment with Zeolitic-Like Activity
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Prussian blue (PB) and PB analogues (PBA) are coordination network materials that present important similarities with zeolites concretely with their ability of adsorbing cations. Depending on the conditions of preparation, which is cheap and easy, PB can be classified into soluble PB and insoluble PB. The zeolitic-like properties are mainly inherent to insoluble form. This form presents some defects in its cubic lattice resulting in an open structure. The vacancies make PB capable of taking up and trapping ions or molecules into the lattice. Important adsorption characteristics of PB are a high specific area (370 m(2) g(-1) determined according the BET theory), uniform pore diameter, and large pore width. PB has numerous applications in many scientific and technological fields. PB are assembled into nanoparticles that, due to their biosafety and biocompatibility, can be used for biomedical applications. PB and PBA have been shown to be excellent sorbents of radioactive cesium and radioactive and nonradioactive thallium. Other cations adsorbed by PB are K+, Na+, NH4+, and some divalent cations. PB can also capture gaseous molecules, hydrocarbons, and even luminescent molecules such as 2-aminoanthracene. As the main adsorptive application of PB is the selective removal of cations from the environment, it is important to easily separate the sorbent of the purified solution. To facilitate this, PB is encapsulated into a polymer or coats a support, sometimes magnetic particles. Finally, is remarkable to point out that PB can be recycled and the adsorbed material can be recovered.

TI Metal-ion-coordinated cross-linked quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte
   for a high energy-density and long-life Prussian blue analogs cathode
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB As one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) cathodes face challenges in terms of poor cycling stability owing to their poor interfacial stability. Poor interfacial stability often leads to irreversible behaviors such as dissolution of cathode transition metals and catalytic decomposition of solvents. Herein, a novel metal ion-coordinated cross-linked quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte was prepared via an in situ method using a four-armed cross-linker, where the denser and more efficient three-dimensional network renders the electrolyte with excellent chemical and electrochemical stabilities, minimizes catalytic decomposition side reactions and improves the interfacial stability of high-voltage PBAs cathodes. Moreover, the combination of in situ technology with Ti-MOFs fillers affords a highly compatible electrode/electrolyte interphase and an organic/inorganic composite Na+ conduction pathway, which accelerates Na+ transport and enhances interfacial stability. Thus, the as-designed polymer electrolyte exhibits an ionic conductivity of 3.85 mS cm-1 and extended oxidation stability of 5.1 V, coupled with improved mechanical strength and safety. The CFM-PBAs & Vert;Na battery demonstrates excellent rate performance and cycling stability (with an average coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% over 2000 cycles). Furthermore, the high-capacity FM-PBAs & Vert;Na battery achieves an ultra-high energy density of 445 Wh kg-1, showcasing significant potential for high energy-density and long-life PBAs cathodes.

TI Morphology engineering ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon Co-FeP derived
   from Co-Fe Prussian Blue Analogs for wide spectrum photocatalytic H2
   evolution
SO FUEL
AB The design and development of economical, efficient and stable photocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a frontier subject of sustainable energy research. In this work, a morphology engineered ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon Co-FeP (Co-FeP@NC) derived from Co-Fe Prussian Blue Analogs (Co-Fe PBA) for wide spectrum photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. We demonstrate the versatility of a self-templated epitaxial growth strategy for construction of single-crystalline hollow nanostructured PBA (Co-Fe PBA cages, frames and boxes) with different geometries by adjusting the growth kinetics. Co-FeP@NC photocatalysts have tunable band structures by adjusted phosphating degree and all have a narrow band gap. In addition, the catalysts with different morphologies have different electronic structures, and surface nitrogen-doped carbon layer increases electron transfer rate, which makes the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity increase significantly. The Co-FeP@NC-4 cages exhibit the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 13309.4 mu mol h-1 g-1 under visible light irradiation with EY as a photosensitizer and TEOA as an electron donor. Additionally, a high apparent quantum efficiency (8.38 % at 520 nm) and an excellent cycle stability was also achieved over Co-FeP@NC-4 cages. The larger specific surface area, strong light absorption ability and fast photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation efficiency of Co-FeP@NC cages may be responsible for the significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. This work has provided an effective strategy for synthesis of nano -structures with different geometric topologies derived from PBA and recognizing their morphology-dependent photocatalytic activity.

TI Anchoring highly-dispersed ZnCdS nanoparticles on NiCo Prussian blue
   Analogue-derived cubic-like NiCoP forms an S-scheme heterojunction for
   improved hydrogen evolution
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB This study used a facile hydrothermal technique to obtain a novel ZnCdS/NiCoP S-scheme heterojunction for highly photocatalytic H(2 )generation, Notably, phosphatization was used to derive the cubic NiCoP from a Prussian blue analog ZnCdS nanoparticles are simple to disperse on the surface because NiCoP has a cubic characteristic, which easily transfers interface charges, and consequently accelerates surface reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the ZnCdS/NiCoP-3% composite exhibited the highest photocatalytic H(2 )generation performance of 582.98 mu mol with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 7.93% at 450 nm in the lactic acid aqueous solution, which is approximately 4.16 and 500-fold higher than that of the pure ZnCdS and NiCoP, respectively. Additionally, outstanding photostability was achieved after 20h of the four cycling experiments. Consequently, the peachy photocatalytic hydrogen evolution can be imputed for establishing S-scheme heterojunction, maintaining doughty redox capacity and achieving spatial separation of charges, thereby vastly restraining the fast recombination of photoexcitation. Furthermore, the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and hydroxyl radical (OH-) capture experiments further proved the S-scheme mechanism. Therefore, this study provides a neoteric perspective establishing S-scheme photocatalytic systems for solar energy conversion. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Redox-state modulated ORR activity of Cd-based Prussian blue analog
   frameworks transformed via anion exchange with controlled
   redox-state from CdCO3 cuboids
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB This work reports a facile solution based chemical transformation of thin film of CdCO3 cuboids into Cd-based Prussian blue analogue structured thin film with controlled redox-state by manipulating the anion exchange reaction between the solid film and the aqueous solution of K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] at 60 degrees C. The progress of the transformation reaction is monitored via electron microscopy, X-ray difractometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Based on the scenario of the reaction progress revealed by these analysis, the CdCO3 cuboids are first found to be transformed into the smaller cuboids of cadmium ferricyanide, which, on further reaction, are transformed into the cadmium ferrocyanide cuboids. Thus, by controlling the redox-state of the Fe-metal center on the frameworks, the electrocatalytic activity of the frameworks on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is studied. The electrocatalytically inert CdCO3 cuboids after transformation to the frameworks with Fe3+-centers demonstrate an enhanced catalytic activity on ORR, while the Fe2+-centers of the frameworks are found to relegate the catalytic activity, thereby manifesting the redox-sate modulated ORR activity of the frameworks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of this kind on redox-state specific ORR activity.

TI Engineering surface electron and active site at electrochemical sensing
   interface of CN vacancy-mediated Prussian blue analogue for analysis of
   heavy metal ions
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB The concept of creating crystal defect sites at interface of sensing materials is of ultimate importance for electrochemical sensing performance, yet the status of surface electron transfer and specific location of active sites for analyte remain unclear at the atomic level. Here, we construct a highly sensitive electrochemical sensing interface via engineering surface electron and active site on the unconventional CN vacancy (VCN)-mediated MnFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) hollow structure. We modulate the surface electron transfer dynamic and identify specific reaction location of VCN-mediated Mn-Fe PBA to obtain a limit of detection of 0.013 mu M (3 sigma method) with a high sensitivity of 7193.64 mu A cm-2 mu M- 1 toward Pb(II), which is fifteen that of pristine Mn-Fe PBA (without VCN). By combining experiments with theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the VCN regulate the electron transfer from metal Fe to Mn atoms, rendering the Mn atoms as active sites for Pb(II) reaction. We also identify a relatively strong interaction between Mn atom and analyte Pb(II) by calculation result of great orbital overlapping of Mn-Pb bond. The adsorbed Pb(II) will undergo redox reaction in situ without considering adsorption-desorption rate on the surface of the sensing material.

TI An innovative dual-signal electrochemical ratiometric determination of
   creatinine based on silver nanoparticles with intrinsic self-calibration
   property for bimetallic Prussian blue analogues
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB An ultrasensitive dual-signal ratiometric electrochemical sensor was developed for creatinine detection utilizing silver nanoparticles (Ag) with intrinsic self-calibration afforded by iron-nickel bimetallic Prussian blue (FeNiPBA) analogues. The Ag@FeNiPBA exhibits two redox signals corresponding to the Ag+/Ag and Fe3+/Fe2+ systems. Adding chloride (Cl-) solution increases the anodic current of the Ag/Ag system significantly due to the formation of silver chloride through solid-state electrochemistry. While the anodic current of the Ag/Ag system decreases in the presence of creatinine due to the competitive reaction, the Fe/Fe system's anodic current remains the same, which enables a ratiometric response. Under optimized conditions, the response ratio (IAg/IFe) decreases while the creatinine concentration increases linearly between 0.015 and 140 & mu;M, with 0.004 & mu;M as a good detection limit (S/N = 3). These results demonstrate superior performance over previously reported methods for electrochemical creatinine determination. The high sensitivity arises from the signal amplification of the Ag/AgCl solid-state electrochemistry, while the selectivity originates from the specific interaction between Ag+ and creatinine. The Ag@FeNiPBA hybrid can quantify creatinine in real samples with good recoveries. This work opens up new opportunities for applying dual-signal nanostructures to develop electrochemical sensors for (bio)molecule detection.

TI Highly stable polyvinylpyrrolidone-encapsulated potassium-rich manganese
   hexacyanoferrate as cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF), a member of the Prussian blue analogue (PBA) family, emerges as a promising cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) due to its 3D open framework, high working potential, and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the MnHCF suffers from an increased amount of water content in crystal structure and structural distortion caused by ion intercalation and Jahn-Teller distortion process which greatly limits their energy density and cycling stability. Herein, we report polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-encapsulated MnHCF (MnHCF@PVP) submicron cubes as cathode materials for AZIBs by employing a simple hydrothermal method. The addition of PVP makes MnHCF structurally more rigid favoring the mitigation of Jahn-Teller distortion and provides greater stability to MnHCF during de/interaction of Zn2+ ions. Consequently, the synthesized MnHCF@PVP exhibits an exceptional specific capacity of 173.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) in conjunction with remarkable rate capability (117 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and cyclic stability (similar to 91 % capacity retention over 5000 cycles). The Zn-ion storage properties of the MnHCF@PVP cathodes are also investigated at different voltage ranges by ex situ analysis. These results highlight that the suggested electrode material in AZIBs could lead to enhanced AZIB performance, including longer cycle life, higher energy density, and improved overall efficiency.

TI In Situ Growth of Hollow Trimetallic Nanocubes on Nickel Foam for the
   Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Nanomaterials derived from Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) possess uniform active centers and large surface areas, which can be applied in the field of electrocatalysis. In this study, nickel-iron-cobalt trimetallic PBAs, that is, NiFeCo(4 : 1)PBA nanocubes, were grown in situ on nickel foam (NF), which was subsequently calcined in air to obtain a composite electrode, NiO/FeOX/Co3O4@NF, with a loose porous hollow nanocube morphology. This structure remarkably enlarged the contact area between the electrolyte and the catalyst. In addition, a synergistic effect among these metallic oxides expedited oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. The Tafel slope (71.25 mV dec(-1)) toward OER of the constructed electrode is fairly small, much lower than that of our prepared bimetallic oxides@NF electrodes. The enduring stability is more than 22 h. This work indicates that, through morphology and composition control, the electrocatalytic performance of the designed electrode can be effectively improved.

   Composition-Dependent Sorption Performances towards Cs<SUP>+</SUP>,

SO JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS
AB Investigation in radioactive contaminant removal from aqueous solutions has been considered essential upon unexpected nuclear accidents. In this report, we have successfully prepared Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with different substituted cations (A(2)[Fe(CN)(6)] (A: Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+)). The synthesized PBAs were characterized and employed for the removal of Cs+, Sr2+, and Co2+ as sorption models, which are commonly found in radioactive waste. Sorption examinations reveal that Cu-2[Fe(CN)(6)] has the highest sorption capacity towards Cs+, Sr2+, and Co2+ compared with those of Co-2[Fe(CN)(6)] and Ni-2[Fe(CN)(6)]. This is mainly attributed to the cation-exchange ability of substituted metal within the framework of PBAs. The sorption mechanism is qualitatively and quantitatively supported by infrared spectroscopy (IR) and total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis (TXRF). In addition, it was found that Cs+ is adsorbed most effectively by PBAs due to the size matching between Cs+ ions and the channel windows of PBAs. These findings are important for the design of sorbents with suitable ion-exchange capacity and selectivity toward targeted radioactive wastes.

TI Rapid synthesis of NiMo-based electrocatalysts at room temperature for
   efficient oxygen and hydrogen evolution in seawater
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Electrocatalytic splitting of seawater instead of scarce freshwater is considered as a feasible way to produce clean hydrogen energy. However, the corrosiveness of seawater poses more requirements for the electrocatalysts to alleviate the damage of chlorine chemistry. The cathode Mo0.84Ni0.16/MoNiOx and anode Fe(OH)3/ MoNiOx derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) were rapidly synthesized by electrodeposition and complexation at room temperature within only 30 min. The overall water splitting device assembled with Fe(OH)3/ MoNiOx and Mo0.84Ni0.16/MoNiOx requires 1.54 V and 1.575 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH + seawater, respectively. Additionally, the device maintains catalytic actssivity at the current density of 100 mA cm-2 for over 120 h in 1 M KOH and modulated alkaline seawater, respectively. The Mo element with high valence state in Fe(OH)3/MoNiOx is dissolves after anodic oxidation, and the Ni(Fe)OOH species generated by in-situ transformation on the surface of catalyst actsss as the actssive center for oxygen evolution reactssion (OER). Furthermore, the Ni and Mo species in Mo0.84Ni0.16/MoNiOx with low valence states could strengthens the water dissociation ability and decreases the hydrogen adsorption energy barrier of the Volmer step in the hydrogen evolution reactssion (HER), thus accelerating the chemical reactssion kinetics. This work provides beneficial implications for the design of non-noble metal electrocatalysts for seawater splitting.

   high-performance spherical manganese hexacyanoferrate for sodium-ion
   batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Traditional cubic Prussian blue analogs with limited processability and low density are not suitable for the fabrication of high energy density sodium-ion batteries. Here, we present a novel reactor called the dual-vortexed coprecipitation chamber (DVCC) and a corresponding click reaction as well as electrostatic adsorption mechanism for producing high-density, size-controllable, spherical and low-deficiency manganese-based Prussian blue analogs. The DVCC takes advantage of the two dual vortexes evolve from its side walls to regulate and control the surface functional groups of PBAs primary cubes, thereby facilitating the formation of spherical particles. Through the optimized controlled crystallization precipitation technique, we are able to precisely regulate the nucleation, crystallization and spherical agglomeration process. In comparison to cubic crystals, our unique spherical particles exhibited superior performance with a controllable size distribution of 0 similar to 40 mu m, compacted density of 1.60 g cm(-3), an initial capacity of 132.5mAh/g and notably retention rates of 99.5 % for coin cell and 86.7 % for pouch cell respectively after 500 cycles at 1C rate. Benefit by the low H2O content (less than 300 ppm) in the electrodes, the pouch cell avoided gas expansion and also demonstrated excellent fast discharge capability with a retention of 78.7 % at a maximum rate of 40C compared to 1C rate.

AB Li-ion storage devices having superior energy density are critical for one-time-charge long-term applications. Currently, much research endeavor is directed at enhancing the energy density of hybrid Li-ion capacitors, which incorporate the high energy of conventional Li-ion batteries with the elevated power density of Li-ion supercapacitors. Herein, we prepare orthorhombic GdCo(CN)(6) as a new Prussian blue analogue (PBA), showing that this compound offers excellent energy/power densities (605 W.h kg(-1) and 174 W kg(-1), respectively) and features Li-ion storage capacities (352 and 258 mA.h g(electrode)(-1) at 100 and 1000 mA g(-1), respectively) that are almost twice higher than those of other cathode materials utilized in hybrid Li-ion capacitors. Thus, this study not only opens a new path for the exploration of new-type PBAs, but also provides insights on the use of lanthanides in energy storage applications.

Instead of a commonly knownhydrothermal method, a simple brush coating method was employed forcatalyst coating which is feasible for large-scale electrolyzer fabrication.Our developed electrolyzer has shown a low overall seawater splittingvoltage of 1.71 V and a good stability of 50 h in seawater with excellentselectivity for OER over hypochlorite formation at room temperature(26 degrees C). High OER activity is attributed to abundant catalyticsites provided by interconnected CoFePBA nanosheets and high intrinsiccatalytic activity. Moreover, suppressed hypochlorite formation andcorrosion resistance resulting from the synergistic effect of CoFePBAand NCNT make CoFePBA/NCNT||Ni/NCT a potential candidatefor seawater electrolyzers. Our work paves a way to demonstrate seawaterelectrolyzer performance with nonprecious catalysts on a nonmetallicsupport.

TI Cation-Specific Electrokinetic Separations Using Prussian Blue
   Intercalation Reactions
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB We report a new approach for forming ion depletion zones (IDZs) using intercalation reactions at an electrochemically controlled Prussian blue (PB) film. The experiments described here were performed using a microfluidic device, wherein a charged fluorophore in solution was used as a proxy to monitor IDZ formation. In the presence of K+, intercalation reactions proceed readily to form an IDZ, and thus enrich the fluorophore up to 37-fold. In the presence of the larger hydrated Li(+)or tetrabutylammonium (TBA(+)) ions, however, ion intercalation proceeded less quickly than with K+. Slower ion intercalation resulted in a weaker IDZ and correspondingly lower enrichment factors of eight- and six-fold, respectively. These results are significant because they show that PB intercalation reactions selectively form an IDZ. Accordingly, we anticipate that these findings will lead to a better understanding and further interesting applications of intercalation materials like PB for efficient and selective enrichment and separations.

TI Fabrication of a Hierarchical

   Prussian Blue Analogue-Based Composite with Enhanced Electrochemical
   Capacitive and Electrocatalytic Properties
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Developing high-efficiency, cost-effective, and durable electrodes is significant for electrochemical capacitors and electrocatalysis. Herein, a 3D bifunctional electrode consisting of nickel hydroxide nanosheets@nickel sulfide nanocubes arrays on Ni foam (Ni(OH)(2)@Ni3S2/NF) obtained from a Prussian blue analogue-based precursor is reported. The 3D higher-order porous structure and synergistic effect of different compositions endow the electrode with large specific surface area, facile ion/electron transport path, and improved conductivity. As a result, the Ni(OH)(2)@Ni3S2/NF electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 211 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and 73 % capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g(-1). Moreover, the Ni(OH)(2)@Ni3S2/NF electrode has superior electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotentials of 140 and 210 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The synthetic strategy for the unique higher-order porous structure can be extended to fabricate other composite materials for energy storage and conversion.

TI In situ preparation of carbon-based Cu-Fe oxide nanoparticles from CuFe
   Prussian blue analogues for the photo-assisted heterogeneous
   peroxymonosulfate activation process to remove lomefloxacin
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this study, carbon-based Cu-Fe oxide (CuFeO@C) was prepared from a Prussian blue analogue (PBA), which exhibited high peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation performance for lomefloxacin (LOM) degradation under UV-visible light (UV-vis) irradiation. Furthermore, the high catalytic activity and applicability of CuFeO@C was discussed by numerous controlled trials and several operational parameters. In fact, CuFeO@C/PMS/UV-vis reaction system not only achieved the superior LOM removal and mineralization performance under simple reaction conditions, but also exhibited excellent reusability. Moreover, the dominant reactive oxide species roles were determined via EPR measurement method and radical capture experiments. The transformed property of photogenerated electrons and transition metal redox cycling during the UV-vis assisted PMS activation process was identified via photoelectrocatalytic detection and XPS analysis. Correspondingly, a possible reaction mechanism and pathway of LOM degradation were proposed. Herein, the high-efficiency CuFeO@C was developed as the photo-PMS activation catalysts for in-depth investigation of the heterogeneous sulfate-based advanced oxidation reaction mechanism.

   Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB A growth strategy is described where a multidimensional P-(Ni, Fe) nanoarray electrode is fabricated by phosphiding NiMoO4 nanoflakes modified with a Ni-based Prussian blue analogue induced by in situ self-sacrificial formation. The generated electrode exhibits a specific capacity of 501.8 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), owing to the unique overlapping cross-stacked network structure with increased surface- and interface-active sites and enhanced conductivity. This is about 2 times larger than those of the NiMoO4 (200.2 mAh g(-1)) and NiMoO4/Ni-Prussian blue analogue (NiMoO4/Ni-PBA) (217.3 mAh g(-1)) electrodes. The battery cell assembled with the obtained P-(Ni, Fe) nanoarray electrode and a Zn plate as the counter electrode shows a high energy density of 962.6 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 870 W kg(-1). This demonstrates the potential of NiMoO4-based materials for NiZn battery applications and gives insight into the design of electrode materials by controlling the surface/interface in next-generation high-performing NiZn batteries.

TI NiCo Prussian-Blue-Derived Cobalt-Nickel-Layered Double Hydroxide with
   High Electrochemical Performance for Supercapacitor Electrodes
SO COATINGS
AB High-performance electrode materials are crucial to the improvement of the supercapacitor performance index. Ni2Co1HCF@CoNi-LDH composites with a core-shell structure were prepared by a combination of coprecipitation and constant potential electrodeposition, and the microscopic morphology and phase composition of the composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, FTIR and XPS. The results showed that the NiCo Prussian blue (Ni2Co1HCF) was grown on the nickel foam (NF) substrate by in situ etching, while the nickel-cobalt double hydroxide (CoNi-LDH) was covered on the NiCo Prussian blue surface by electrodeposition, and the composite still retained the cubic skeleton morphology of the NiCo Prussian blue. The electrochemical properties of the composites were investigated using a three-electrode system in 2 M KOH. The results showed that their discharge specific capacity was as high as 1937 F center dot g(-1) at a current density of 1 A center dot g(-1) and still had 81.3% capacity retention at 10 A center dot g(-1), and they exhibited an excellent rate capability. The capacity retention rate was 87.1% after 1000 cycles at 5 A center dot g(-1) and, thus, the composite material has good application prospects as a supercapacitor electrode material.

TI Prussian blue analogs (PBA) derived porous bimetal (Mn, Fe) selenide
   with carbon nanotubes as anode materials for sodium and potassium ion
   batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The development of sodium/potassium-ion batteries with excellent performance would break the conflict between the limited lithium resources and low-price requirement of lithium-ion batteries. However, because of the bigger sizes of sodium/potassium ion in comparison to lithium ion, the requirement of anode materials with suitable structure for sodium/potassium ions insertion/extraction is still challenging. Here, porous MnSe/FeSe2 (Mn-Fe-Se) adhered/inserted with interlaced carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been successfully designed and prepared via a simple chemical precipitation approach and a subsequent one-step carbonization-selenization of Mn-Fe Prussian blue analogs precursor process. Characterization results demonstrate that the prepared Mn-Fe-Se/CNTs with high conductive network architecture are constructed by Mn-Fe-Se sphere adhered/inserted with interlaced CNTs, each Mn-Fe-Se sphere is assembled using several tens of nanoparticles and numerous voids, and the individual nanoparticle is uniformly coated by a thin nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon layer. Due to such unique porous architecture and synergistic effect of the heterogeneous components, Mn-Fe-Se/CNTs anode possesses reversible sodium/potassium storage with excellent rate performance and prominent cycling stability. Furthermore, the sodium and potassium storage mechanisms and kinetics verify the fundamental principles of improved electrochemical performance. This study will shed light on the development of other metal selenides with interlaced carbon nanotubes for high-performance sodium/potassium-ion batteries and other energy storage equipment.

TI Synthesis of ultrasmall vanadium ferricyanide nanocrystallines with the
   aidance of graphene self-assembled fibers towards reinforced zinc
   storage performance
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Vanadium -based Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) are a novel idea to couple the high voltage platform of PBAs with the large energy density of vanadium -based compounds. However, in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), PBA cathodes are still limited by their inherent defects and poor conductivity, thus limiting their use. Herein, a graphene self -assembled fiber (GSAF) forming a stereoscopic conductive carbon framework is obtained by a onestep carbothermal reduction method, after which vanadyl Prussian blue hexacyanoferrate (KVO-HCF) nano -units are grown in -situ on the GSAF surface by a one-step co -precipitation method to obtain the composite GSAF@KVO-HCF. Benefiting from the tight binding of PBA particles to the three-dimensional carbon architecture, the transport distance of Zn 2+ becomes shorter, the system conductivity is enhanced and the solubilization of V is suppressed. In terms of specific capacity, the composite cathode demonstrates a performance of 119 mAh g -1 with stable reversibility. In the aspect of cycling performance, its specific capacity still holds 103 mAh g -1 after 1000 cycles. By combining experimental studies (in/ex-situ characterizations) and theoretical calculations, Zn 2+ and proton co-insertion/extraction mechanisms for this composite as a cathode for AZIBs are described. The testing of the soft -packed pack battery highlights the practical application prospect of the composite.

TI Construction of Dual S-Scheme Heterojunction Based
   Co9S8 QDs Coupling with NiS/CdS Concave Cubic
   Derived from Prussian Blue Analog for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen
   Evolution
SO ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS
AB The design and development of high-efficiency and low-energy consumption catalysts for hydrogen evolution are critical to mitigating environmental problems. Herein, amorphous Co9S8 quantum dots (QDs) are prepared by hydrothermal method and loaded on concave cubic NiS/CdS derived from Prussian blue analog (PBA) to construct an efficient Co9S8 QDs/NiS/CdS dual S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts, showing excellent photocatalytic hydrogen performance of 13.45 mmol<middle dot>g(-1)<middle dot>h(-1), which is 5.42 times higher than that of pure CdS. The improved photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the creation of a double S-scheme heterojunction, quantum confinement effect, and a concave cubic structure, accelerating electron transport and offering ample surface active sites. The possible mechanism is demonstrated with valence band XPS (VB-XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides insight into the exploration of PBA-based photocatalysts to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and provides an effective strategy for the design of photocatalysts with double the S-scheme heterojunction.

TI Hollow nanocubic CoP-FeP/NC heterostructures for efficient
   electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction
SO FUEL
AB Slow mass transport and charge transfer restrict the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of FeP. Herein, we synthesized Fe-based bimetallic Prussian blue analogues (CoFe, NiFe, and CuFe-PBAs), and further prepared nitrogen-doped carbon anchored FeP-based heterostructures namely CoP-FeP/NC, Ni2P-FeP/ NC, and Cu3P-FeP/NC using template-assisted and phosphating annealing strategies. It is worth noting that CoPFeP/NC shows a hollow nanocubic structure, shortening the ion transport pathway and facilitating surface atom exposure, thus improving reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, the similar atomic radius of Co and Fe promotes the formation of stable CoP-FeP heterointerfaces with the same crystal system components and low lattice mismatch, inducing the electron transfer from Co to Fe and generating more low-valent Fe cations, thereby enhancing activity. Besides, Co and Fe sites underwent surface reconstruction into CoOOH and FeOOH active species, therefore achieving efficient synergistic electrocatalytic OER. As a result, CoP-FeP/NC exhibits superior OER activity (254 mV@10 mA cm-2) than Ni2P-FeP/NC and Cu3P-FeP/NC in 1.0 M KOH solution, even exceeds commercial RuO2 (266 mV@10 mA cm-2), and presents no obvious performance decay (11.26 %) after continuous electrolysis at 100 mA cm-2 for 100 h, showing practical application prospects. Our work provides a general approach for preparing efficient and stable FeP-based heterostructures as OER electrocatalysts.

TI KxCo1.5-0.5xFe(CN)6/rGO with
   Dual-Active Sodium Ion Storage Site as Superior Anode for Sodium Ion
   Battery
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The unique and open large frame structures of prussian blue analogues (PBA) enables it for accommodating a large number of cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc.), thus, PBA are considered as promising electrode materials for the rechargeable battery. However, due to the chemical composition, there are still many alkaline metal ions in the gap within the framework, which puts multivalent metals in PBA in a low valence state and affects the sodium storage performance. To improve the valence of metal ions in PBA materials, precursors prepared by co-precipitation method and hydrothermal method are used to synthesis KxCo1.5-0.5xFe(CN)(6) through further chemical oxidation. Through the introducing of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with excellent conductivity by a simple physical mixing method, the cycle stability and rate performance of the PBA material can be further improved. The K0.5Co1.2Fe(CN)(6)center dot 2H(2)O/rGO anode prepared with 2 h hydrothermal time and further chemical oxidation, named as KCoHCP-H2-EK/rGO, exhibits a super electrochemical performance, delivering initial charge/discharge capacities of 846.7/1445.0 mAh center dot g(-1), and a capacity retention of 58.2% after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA center dot g(-1). The KCoHCP-H2-EK/rGO outstanding electrochemical behaviors are attributed to the unique dual-active site structure properties and the improved surface conductance of materials by rGO components.

AB Recently, considerable attention has been given to Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as efficient battery-type electrode materials for devising advanced hybrid supercapacitors. In this study, nickel hexacyanocobaltate (NiHCC) was considered as a PBA system to successfully synthesize carbon nanotubes- (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers- (CNFs) hybridized NiHCC nanocomposites following a single-step hydrothermal process and the corresponding battery-type electrochemical storage behavior was investigated in 3 M KOH. All the synthesized electrodes exhibited battery-type charge storage mechanisms with excellent stability. The NiHCC-CNT composite (NiHCC@CNT) electrode, in particular, exhibited excellent charge storage capacity (348 mAh g-1 at 1 Ag-1) owing to its high electrochemically active surface area, low charge transfer resistance, and efficient utilization of redox centers for K+ ion storage. Moreover, the hybrid capacitor constructed using NiHCC@CNT exhibited excellent cycling stability over 5000 cycles with a maximum energy density of 59 W h Kg- 1 at a power density of 1798 W Kg-1. This work demonstrates the potential of NiHCC@CNT composite as a cathode material for K+ ion supercapacitors.

TI Direct monitoring of the potassium charge carrier in Prussian blue
   cathodes using potassium K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue is widely utilized as a cathode material in batteries, due to its ability to intercalate alkaline metal ions, including potassium. However, the exact location of potassium or other cations within the complex structure, and how it changes as a function of cycling, is unclear. Herein, we report direct insight into the nature of potassium speciation within Prussian blue during cyclic voltammetry, via operando potassium K-edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) analysis. Clear and identifiable spectra are experimentally differentiated for the fully intercalated (fully reduced (Fe2+FeII) Prussian white), partially intercalated (Prussian blue; (Fe3+FeII)), and free KNO3(aq) electrolyte. Comparison of the experiment with simulated XANES of theoretical structures indicates that potassium lies within the channels of the Prussian blue structure, but is displaced towards the periphery of the channels by occluded water and/or structural water present resulting from [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) vacancies. The structural composition from the charge carrier perspective was monitored for two samples of differing crystallite size and electrochemical stability. Reproducible potassium XANES spectral sequences were observed for large crystallites (ca. 100 nm) of Prussian blue, in agreement with retention of capacity; in contrast, the capacity of a sample with small crystallites (ca. 14 nm) declined as the potassium became trapped within the partially intercalated Prussian blue. The cause of degradation could be attributed to a significant loss of [Fe(CN)(6)]-[Fe(NC)(6)] ordering and the formation of a potassium-free non-conducting ferrihydrite phase. These findings demonstrate the potential of XANES to directly study the nature and evolution of potassium species during an electrochemical process.

TI Study of Ferrocyanide Adsorption onto Different Minerals as Prebiotic
   Chemistry Assays
SO ASTROBIOLOGY
AB Considered one of the most promising building blocks of life on primitive Earth, cyanide and its complexes are likely to have played an important role in the emergence of life on the planet. Investigation into cyanide on Earth has primarily considered high concentrations, but the cyanide concentration in the oceans of prebiotic Earth was exceptionally low. Thus, Bernal's hypothesis has allowed investigators to work around this problem. We observed, however, that cyanide does not adsorb onto several minerals; therefore, ferrocyanide could be used as a cyanide source when adsorbed onto mineral surfaces to promote the synthesis of molecules of biological significance. When adsorbed onto bentonite, a mineral that has Fe3+ atoms in its interlayers, the formation of Prussian blue analog complexes occurs through endothermic reaction and with increased entropy. The adsorption of ferrocyanide onto kaolinite indicates an exothermic and outer-sphere interaction, which results in degeneracy breakdown for C equivalent to N stretch energy into two new bands of FTIR-ATR spectrum. Magnetite, which has iron atoms in its structure, and ferrocyanide interactions have been observed by outer-sphere coordination as well as the formation of Prussian blue analogs, as confirmed by the appearance of a new doublet in the Mossbauer spectra and a broadband close to 750 nm at UV-visible spectroscopy. Magnetite and kaolinite experiments presented relevant results only when performed in seawater, which suggests the importance of seawater composition for prebiotic experiments. These obtained results prove that ferrocyanide interacts with minerals differently according to structure and composition and show that this complex, like the Prussian blue analogs, may have played a crucial role as a source of cyanide on primitive Earth.

TI Facile peptide-mediated green synthesis of iron hexacyanocobalt
   nanostructures for efficient intercalative deionization and water
   disinfection
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) synergized with disinfection capability is a promising technique for simultaneous deionization and microbial killing from brackish water. Moreover, rational design of Faradaic-based intercalation electrodes with abundant active sites and high capacitance have shown great significance in substantial boosting saline ions removal efficiency over carbonaceous electrodes in CDI system. Herein, iron hexacyanocobalt (FeHCC) based Prussian blue analogues and its peptide (e-Poly-L-lysine, e-PL)-mediated derivative (FeHCC/e-PL) synthesized by a feasible one-step aqueous assembly are firstly developed as CDI electrodes. The synergistic effects of the structural/compositional characteristics, such as, enriched binding sites and highly open crystalline structures, optimize ions intercalation dynamics and thus endow the FeHCC/e-PL electrode with enhanced electrochemical performance. Particularly, FeHCC/e-PL electrode possesses a superior desalination capacity of 83.8 mg/g in 250 mg/L feedwaters. Also, FeHCC/e-PL electrode exhibits outstanding intercalation adsorption capacity of Ca2+ and Mg2+and removal efficiency of heavy metal-ions based on the intercalation pseudocapacitive mechanism. Interestingly, FeHCC/e-PL electrode can also contribute remarkable antibacterial efficiencies of 95.5 % against Escherichia coli during desalination process without using extra disinfectants. We report facile and sustainable one-step doping engineering, opening up a new avenue for tailored PBAs design and green synthesis in a rapid and sustainable way. The work offers important insights on highly efficient brackish water desalting/softening, heavy metal-ions removing, and water disinfecting simultaneously in Prussian blue analogues-based CDI techniques.

TI Reusable electrochemical non-enzymatic glucose sensors based on
   Au-inlaid nanocages
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Mass detection of glucose, which is required in many applications, remains challenging. The commercial enzyme-based glucose test strips cannot be reused, and current non-enzymatic glucose sensors exhibit a narrow range of detection and slow glucose oxidation kinetics. Herein, controlled etching of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes at the vertices is conducted and Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) are subsequently inlaid in the etched cavities by in-situ reduction of HAuCl4. The unique AuNP-PBA nanocomplexes exhibit low electrochemical potential for glucose oxidation, high electrocatalytic activity, and rapid redox electron transfer rate. Covalent immobilization of the Au-inlaid nanomaterials on a fine Au wire leads to a non-enzymatic glucose sensor with a particularly wide linear detection range (10 mu M to 16 mM), excellent anti-interference, and fast response. More importantly, the sensor is reusable, and its sensitivity is well maintained even after 150 times of detection. This new-concept material promises to enable high-throughput glucose detection at a low cost, which is essential in diabetic management and other healthcare applications.

TI A Na-Rich Nanocomposite of
   Na1.83Ni0.12Mn0.88Fe
   (CN)6/RGO as Cathode for Superior Performance Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO NANO
AB Prussian blue analogs are receiving intense attention due to their high theoretical energy density and low cost, but their real applications are still hampered by poor electronic conductivity and cycling stability. Here, Na1.83Ni0.12Mn0.88Fe(CN)(6) wrapped with graphene was synthesized by a facile co-precipitation method. The existence of RGO not only significantly increases the conductivity of the cathode, but also makes the framework much more robust during long cycling process. As the cathode, the Na1.83Ni0.12Mn0.88Fe(CN)(6)/RGO is able to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 120 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 20 mA g(-1) with superior capacity retention of 96.7% after 100 cycles. Even at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1), the cell still delivers a capacity of 86 mA h g(-1), indicating outstanding rate capability. The results and the facile synthesis method enable Na1.83Ni0.12Mn0.88Fe(CN)(6)/RGO to the competitive for a future energy storage system.

TI Molecular Approach to Alkali-Metal Encapsulation by a Prussian Blue
   Analogue Fe<SUP>II</SUP>/Co<SUP>III</SUP> Cube in Aqueous Solution: A
   Kineticomechanistic Exchange Study
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The preparation of a series of alkali-metal inclusion complexes of the molecular cube [{Co-III(Me-3-tacn)}(4) {Fe-II(CN)(6)}(4)](4-) (Me-3-tacn = 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane), a mixed-valent Prussian Blue analogue bearing bridging cyanido ligands, has been achieved by following a redox-triggered self-assembly process. The molecular cubes are extremely robust and soluble in aqueous media ranging from 5 M [H+] to 2 M [OH-]. All the complexes have been characterized by the standard mass spectometry, UV-vis, inductively coupled plasma, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, and electrochemistry. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction analysis of the sodium and lithium salts has also been achieved, and the inclusion of moieties of the form {M-OH2}(+) (M = Li, Na) is confirmed. These inclusion complexes in aqueous solution are rather inert to cation exchange and are characterized by a significant decrease in acidity of the confined water molecule due to hydrogen bonding inside the cubic cage. Exchange of the encapsulated cationic {M-OH2}(+ )or M+ units by other alkali metals has also been studied from a kineticomechanistic perspective at different concentrations, temperatures, ionic strengths, and pressures. In all cases, the thermal and pressure activation parameters obtained agree with a process that is dominated by differences in hydration of the cations entering and exiting the cage, although the size of the portal enabling the exchange also plays a determinant role, thus not allowing the large Cs+-cation to enter. All the exchange substitutions studied follow a thermodynamic sequence that relates with the size and polarizing capability of the different alkali cations; even so, the process can be reversed, allowing the entry of {Li-OH2}(+) units upon adsorption of the cube on an anion exchange resin and subsequent washing with a Li+ solution.

TI A Hybrid Energy Storage Mechanism of Zinc Hexacyanocobaltate-Based
   Metal-Organic Framework Endowing Stationary and High-Performance
   Lithium-Ion Storage
SO ELECTRONIC MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered to be theoretically promising with regard to large-scale energy storage and conversion systems. However, a significant problem is the lack of cost-efficient high-performance cathode materials for LIBs. In this study, we demonstrate a Prussian blue analog, zinc hexacyanocobaltate (ZnHCCo), as the low-cost and high-performance cathode material for LIBs. The open-framework crystal structure of ZnHCCo contributes toward reversible cation insertion and extraction along with the spontaneous valence change of hosts. Specifically, the as-prepared ZnHCCo exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 121.5mAhg(-1) at a current density of 1.25C, a superior rate capability of 60.5mAhg(-1) at 6.25C, and a stable cycling stability with a Coulombic efficiency of 96.5%. Therefore, the well-crystallized and low-cost ZnHCCo is expected to be a potential cathode material for LIBs used in grid-scale energy storage and conversion systems. In addition, the synthesis process of the electrode material can be readily up scaled using the earth abundant and environmentally benign precursors via a room-temperature wet-chemical method.

TI Application of Prussian blue nanoparticles for the radioactive Cs
   decontamination in Fukushima region
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
AB Cs decontamination efficiencies of the composites of iron hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles were investigated in comparison with commercial Prussian blue and natural zeolite. In pure water solution, the adsorption rate varied with sizes. In ash extract, where Cs adsorbing ability of zeolite was sharply dropped due to its poor selectivity, the impact of coexisting ions was negligible for FeHCF. FeHCF-n11, having the finest primary and secondary particle size, resulted the highest distribution coefficient, which was comparable to the high efficiency analogues, CoHCF or NiHCF. This observation suggested the possibility of preparing the high performance FeHCF by particle size and composition adjustment. FeHCF nanoparticle in bead form was tested for the removal of radioactive Cs in pilot scale. Due to larger secondary particle size, pronounced effect of solution temperature on the Cs adsorption kinetics on FeHCF bead was observed. Adjusting the mass of the adsorbent for the given solution temperature is recommended for achieving high decontamination rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mn-HCF@Fe-HCF Core-Shell Architecture: Enhancing Structural Stability
   and Electrochemical Performance of Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO NANO
AB To overcome the structural failure of Manganese-based Prussian blue analogue (Mn-HCF) as a cathode material of sodium ion batteries caused by Mn ion dissolution induced by Jahn-Teller effect, we coated Mn-HCF with iron-based Prussian blue (Fe-HCF) to prepare the core-shell Mn-HCF@Fe-HCF cathode material for sodium ion batteries through co-precipitation method. The research results indicate that this structure effectively blocks the direct contact between Mn-HCF and electrolyte, thereby minimizing the dissolution of Mn3+ in the electrolyte and significantly improving the cycling stability and rate performance. The discharge capacity of this material at a current density of 0.1C (14mAg(-1)) is 129.7mAhg(-1). It still has a capacity of 87.4mAhg(-1) at a current density of 2C (280mAg(-1)), and still has a capacity retention rate of 84.3% (91mAhg(-1)) after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.5C (70mAg(-1)). Compared with the capacity retention rate of 51.5% of Mn-HCF 100 cycles before coating, the cycle stability of Mn-HCF@Fe-HCF is greatly improved.

   conditions
SO INORGANIC AND NANO-METAL CHEMISTRY
AB Co-Fe-Prussian blue analogue (Co-Fe-PBA) is developed as a reusable nano catalyst and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and BET SA-PSD methods. It is used for the thiocyanation of aromatic and hetero aromatic compounds in presence of NH4SCN under acid free solvothermal and solvent-free conditions. Observed Reaction times are dramatically reduced from solvothermal (15 to 20 hr) to sonication reactions (25 to 40 min), which are further reduced in mortar-pestle grinding (8 to 10 min) and in microwave assisted (4 to 7 min) protocols. Reaction products are confirmed by the well-established spectroscopic methods. Rate accelerations from solvothermal to greenery Sonication, microwave, and Mortar-Pestle grinding are explained suitably.

TI Ni-Co-LDH and Zn-Co Prussian blue analogue derived hierarchical
   NiCo2O4@ZnO/ZnCo2O4 microspheres with enhanced electrochemical sensing
   performance towards pentachloronitrobenzene
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB In this work, we developed a hierarchical structure and multi-component synergistic metal oxide hybrid material, and explored its practical application in monitoring pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB). We used the ZnO/ ZnCo2O4, obtained by calcining Zn-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA), as the substrate and integrated Ni-Co layered double hydroxide (LDH) on its surface and calcined to obtain hierarchical NiCo2O4@ZnO/ZnCo2O4 microspheres (MSs). Due to the p-n heterojunction characteristics of p-type semiconductor NiCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4 and n-type semiconductor ZnO and the high specific surface area of the microspheres supported by the hierarchical structure conductive network, when this material was used to modify the glassy carbon electrode (GCE), it significantly enhanced the electrochemical sensing performance towards PCNB. Therefore, a new type of electrochemical sensor was constructed based on NiCo2O4@ZnO/ZnCo2O4 MSs and molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for the sensitive and highly selective detection of PCNB. Among them, the MIP membrane was fabricated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to detect PCNB. Under the optimum conditions, the reduction peak current density of PCNB was linearly related to the concentration from 0.05 to 5.5 mu M with a detection limit of 8.33 nM and a good sensitivity of 6.118 mu A.mu M- 1.cmi 2. Furthermore, the proposed MIP sensor exhibited high selectivity, reproducibility, repeatability, and stability, and had been used for the detection of PCNB residues in licorice, river water, and soil samples with satisfactory results.

TI Co-Precipitation Synthesis of
   Co3[Fe(CN)6]2•10H2O@rGO
   Anode Electrode for Lithium-Ion Batteries
SO MATERIALS
AB Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are known to be practical and cost-effective devices for storing electric energy. LIBs have a low energy density, which calls for the development of new anode materials. The Prussian blue analog (PBA) is identified as being a candidate electrode material due to its facile synthesis, open framework structures, high specific surface areas, tunable composition, designable topologies and rich redox couples. However, its poor electrical conductivity and mechanical properties are the main factors limiting its use. The present study loaded PBA (Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot 10H(2)O) on graphene oxide (Co-Fe-PBA@rGO) and then conducted calcination at 300 degrees C under the protection of nitrogen, which reduced the crystal water and provided more ion diffusion pathways. As a result, Co-Fe-PBA@rGO showed excellent performance when utilized as an anode in LIBs, and its specific capacities were 546.3 and 333.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 1.0 A g(-1), respectively. In addition, the electrode also showed excellent performance in the long-term cycle, and its capacity reached up to 909.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) following 100 cycles.

TI Optimization of sodium-ion battery cathode performance by nickel-based
   Prussian blue epitaxial growth with iron-based Prussian blue core-shell
   structure
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB To address the structural defects and poor electrical conductivity of conventional Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) samples, in this study, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) and nickel hexacyanoferrate epitaxially grown with iron hexacyanoferrate (Ni@FeHCF-X) series of samples were successfully synthesized by co-precipitation combined with epitaxial growth technique, and their structural and electrochemical properties were systematically characterized. X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) results show that all the samples maintain a cubic crystal system structure, and the diffraction peaks of the (220) and (400) crystal planes are shifted to a lower angle with the epitaxial growth of ferric hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF). The successful embedding of Fe was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement data. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show that the samples are in a cubic morphology, and the surfaces gradually become rounded from sharp to rounded with the increase of the Fe content. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analyses confirm the successful construction of the core-shell structure and the homogeneous distribution of the elements. Electrochemical testing showed that the Ni@FeHCF-X samples exhibited higher specific capacities and superior rate performance compared to NiHCF, particularly the Ni@FeHCF-4 sample, which delivered a high specific capacity of 73.4 mAh center dot g-1 at a current density of 100 mA center dot g-1, significantly outperforming the 38.2 mAh center dot g-1 achieved by NiHCF. Additionally, the capacity retention rate of Ni@FeHCF-4 reached 42.16 %. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further confirmed the reduced charge transfer resistance and enhanced reversibility of the electrochemical reactions in the Ni@FeHCF-X samples. These results demonstrate that Ni@FeHCF-4 significantly enhances the electrochemical performance of the samples in aqueous sodium-ion battery, providing new insights into the design of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.

TI Long-life stability and high energy density storage MnCoPB-PDA/NF
   electrode material in hybrid supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Three dimensional-metal organic frameworks have drawn a lot of interest for high-performance supercapacitors, particularly those that contain carbon components, due to their enhanced stability, substantial specific surface area, electrical conductivity, and nanocubic topologies. Metal organic frameworks and its analogues are two types of efficient materials that are being developed for energy storage and conversion. Their multifunctional properties, more porosity, variable chemical compositions, and various morphologies open up a world of promise in the quest for suitable electrode materials for batteries. Manganese-cobalt-Prussian blue analogues/Nickel foam and Manganese-cobalt-Prussian blue analogues-polydopamine/Nickel foam nanocubes are synthesized as supercapacitor electrode materials using a co-precipitation process at room temperature. Manganese-cobaltPrussian blue analogues-polydopamine/Nickel foam illustration brilliant electrochemical performance with a more specific capacitance of 458 F/g at 1 A/g and specific capacitance retention of 98.4 % after 10,000 cycles thanks to its distinctive nanocube-like structure, which offers more electro-active sites and a shorter route for electrolyte diffusion and electron transfer. The findings show that a technique for creating tri-metallic three dimensional-metal organic frameworks nanocubes is a good electrode for extremely effective energy storage application.

TI Enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and stability of Prussian blue
   analogues by increasing their electroactive sites through the
   introduction of Au nanoparticles
SO NANOSCALE
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been proven as excellent Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic, neutral and alkaline media. Further improvements can be achieved by increasing their electrical conductivity, but scarce attention has been paid to quantify the electroactive sites of the electrocatalyst when this enhancement occurs. In this work, we have studied how the chemical design influences the specific density of electroactive sites in different Au-PBA nanostructures. Thus, we have first obtained and fully characterized a variety of monodisperse core@shell hybrid nanoparticles of Au@PBA (PBA of (NiFeII)-Fe-II and (CoFeII)-Fe-II) with different shell sizes. Their catalytic activity is evaluated by studying the OER, which is compared to pristine PBAs and other Au-PBA heterostructures. By using the coulovoltammetric technique, we have demonstrated that the introduction of 5-10% of Au in weight in the core@shell leads to an increase in the electroactive mass and thus, to a higher density of active sites capable of taking part in the OER. This increase leads to a significant decrease in the onset potential (up to 100 mV) and an increase (up to 420%) in the current density recorded at an overpotential of 350 mV. However, the Tafel slope remains unchanged, suggesting that Au reduces the limiting potential of the catalyst with no variation in the reaction kinetics. These improvements are not observed in other Au-PBA nanostructures mainly due to a lower contact between both compounds and the Au oxidation. Hence, an Au core activates the PBA shell and increases the conductivity of the resulting hybrid, while the PBA shell prevents Au oxidation. The strong synergistic effect existing in the core@shell structure evidences the importance of the chemical design for preparing PBA-based nanostructures exhibiting better electrocatalytic performances and higher electrochemical stabilities.

TI Prussian blue analogues derived porous nitrogen-doped carbon
   microspheres as high-performance metal-free peroxymonosulfate activators
   for non-radical-dominated degradation of organic pollutants
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Nitrogen-doped carbon materials are becoming a new type of metal-free heterogeneous catalysts in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation. In this study, porous nitrogen-doped carbon (PNC) microspheres derived from Zn-Co Prussian blue analogues (Zn-Co PBAs) are employed as heterogeneous catalysts in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The unique configuration of the metal centers/clusters bound by cyanide groups (-C equivalent to N) of Zn-Co PBAs offers the PNC microspheres abundant porosity, a high graphitization degree, and rich nitrogen substitution, which lead to improvements in the catalytic performance. PNC-800 (pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C) exhibits better performance than other common carbon materials and homologous nitrogen-doped carbocatalysts derived from ZIF-8/ZIF-67. Based on radical quenching and trapping experiments, a non-radical pathway is proposed to dominate methylene blue (MB) degradation; and the high graphitization degree and rich surface graphitic N sites of PNC-800 are two key factors that induce the non-radical pathway. Several influential factors, including catalyst dosage, PMS concentration, pH value and reaction temperature, are investigated in detail. Notably, MB degradation over PNC-800 is almost completely insusceptible to common ions and natural organic matter, and maintains its catalytic efficiency under the background conditions of several real water samples. More interestingly, this non-radical pathway and the good catalytic performance of the PNC-800/PMS system are universal in the degradation of other typical organic pollutants. We believe that these PNC microspheres may be a promising green heterogeneous catalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants, and this study can be used for the design of high-performance carbocatalysts in non-radical systems in the future.

TI Core-Shell FeCo Prussian Blue Analogue/Ni(OH)2 Derived Porous
   Ternary Transition Metal Phosphides Connected by Graphene for
   Effectively Electrocatalytic Water Splitting
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB As a promising new-star electrocatalyst, transition metal phosphide (TMP) has been widely applied in electrocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). However, the current catalytic activity and stability are unsatisfactory. Herein, we started from optimizing the geometric and electronic structure of the catalyst, choosing FeCo Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with rich pores as precursors and epitaxially grown Ni(OH)(2) and then connecting them though graphene oxide (GO) by electrostatic interaction, and finally transformed them into ternary TMPs and graphene composites (Fe2P/CoP/Ni5P4/RGO). Due to the porous structure of phosphides and the large surface area and excellent conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), the Fe2P/CoP/Ni5P4/RGO exposed more active sites, promoted electrolyte diffusion and gas release, and accelerated the charge transport. The synergistic effect among ternary TMPs and between them and RGO made Fe2P/CoP/Ni5P4/RGO a highly efficient electrocatalyst for water splitting with only 57 mV, 232 mV overpotential, and 1.56 V cell voltage for obtaining 10 mA/cm(2) current density in HER, OER, and overall water splitting. Benefiting from the protection of RGO, the Fe2P/CoP/Ni5P4/RGO remained the original structure and showed good stability during long-term testing. This work proposed a design thought to improve the activity and stability of metal phosphides that may be extended to other metal organic framework-derived compounds and carbon-based materials composites.

TI Synthesis of a new Ag<SUP>+</SUP>-decorated Prussian blue analog with
   high peroxidase-like activity and its application in measuring the
   content of the antioxidant substances in Lycium ruthenicum Murr.
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB A new Prussian blue analog (PBA) that contains three metal elements and has peroxidase-like activity was synthesized by a simple method. Then, AgNO3 solution was added slowly to the PBA solution under continuous stirring. We found that this synthesis method could be used to prepare other PBAs, and that the anchoring of Ag+ on the surface of PBA could enhance the peroxidase-like activity of the material, suggesting potential applications for the Ag+-decorated Prussian blue analog (Ag-PBA) in traditional Chinese medicine. Ag-PBA is a new type of multi-metal cubic nano-enzyme that exhibits good stability and excellent peroxidase-like activity; as such, it could catalyze the oxidation of 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2 and Ag-PBA. We then developed a new method to measure the content of antioxidant substances in Chinese herbs by using the excellent peroxidase-like activity of Ag-PBA. Using the Chinese herb Lycium ruthenicum Murr. as a model compound, we measured the content of the antioxidant substances in Lycium ruthenicum Murr. by this new method. After optimization of reaction temperature, concentrations of TMB and H2O2, and reaction time, the content of the antioxidant substances was measured and calculated in comparison with anthocyanidin standards. The results of the Ag-PBA method and the classical DPPH method were compared by a paired t-test, with no statistically significant difference found between the methods. Hence, these two methods can be used interchangeably, although the Ag-PBA method had the advantages of simplicity, rapidness, and good stability. Moreover, the Ag-PBA method has a low limit of quantification and a shorter reaction time, which are improvements on the DPPH method, and it is not necessary to avoid light. Therefore, we anticipate that the Ag-PBA method may be used widely for the measurement of the content of antioxidant substances in Chinese herbs.

SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB The development of reusable paper-like media that respond to more than one stimulus to achieve anticounterfeiting and erasable writing remains challenging. Herein, dual-stimuli responsive color-changing nanofibrous membranes were fabricated based on solvo- and thermochromoic prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and electrospinning technology. The prepared Co-PBA and polyacrylonitrile (Co-PBA/PAN) composite nanofibrous membranes exhibited instantaneous and obvious color changes upon exposure to heat or solvents e.g. ethanol. Together with excellent flexibility, stability, reversibility and cycle performance, Co-PBA/PAN nanofibrous membranes have been successfully applied for fabricating anti-counterfeiting labels and rewritable paper with dual stimulus response capabilities. Moreover, anti-counterfeiting labels with extended complexity were also fabricated by exploiting the tunable transition temperature and loading content of Co-PBA.

TI Boosting oxygen evolution with amine-induced reconstruction
SO FUEL
AB Developing of highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution is one of the most important issues for water splitting. It is widely accepted that Fe sites can act as active centers for oxygen evolution in alkaline solution. Herein, an amine-mediated strategy was used to induce the reconstruction of nanoscale Prussian blue analogue. The nanoscale cubes of Prussian blue analogue can be etched by amine ligand, inducing the formation of hollow structure and small sized pieces. In the etching process, Fe-based species in situ preferentially loads on the surface of newly generated units, which can expose more iron sites and thus promotes the electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution. The optimized catalyst exhibits an incredibly low overpotential of 257 mV at 10 mA & sdot;cm- 2 and a small Tafel slope of 44.1 mV dec- 1 with remarkable stability in alkaline solution. After OER operation, Ni-doped FeOOH with thin sheet-like structure was formed on the surface of catalyst particles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirms the key role of Fe active sites in the OER process, and that the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe sites modulates the adsorption behavior of intermediates and so results in enhanced activity. This work provides an efficient strategy for advanced oxygen evolution catalysts towards electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

TI The Positive Effect of Iron Doping in the Electrocatalytic Activity of
   Cobalt Hexacyanoferrate
SO CATALYSTS
AB The lack of an earth-abundant, robust, and fast electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (water oxidation) is a major bottleneck for the development of an scalable scheme towards the production of electrolytic hydrogen and other synthetic fuels from renewable energy and natural feedstocks. While many transition metal oxides work reasonably well in basic media, very few alternatives are available in neutral or acidic media. One promising candidate comes from the Prussian blue family, cobalt hexacyanoferrate. This electrocatalyst offers robust activity in a large pH range (0 < pH < 13), although current densities are limited due to slow charge transfer kinetics. Herein, we report how the partial substitution of catalytically active Co centres by additional Fe boosts current densities, reaching over 100 mA/cm2, more than double the performance of the parent Co2[Fe(CN)6]. Those new results clearly increase the opportunity for this catalyst to become relevant in industrial-ready electrolyser architectures.

TI A rechargeable aqueous phenazine-Prussian blue proton battery with long
   cycle life
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Aqueous proton batteries (APBs) are one of the most attractive technologies for grid-scale storage of renewable energy due to their unique merits of a proton as a charge carrier, such as light weight, small ionic radius, and the ability to bind covalently or ionically to various organic/inorganic moieties. Although various types of electrode materials have been employed in APBs, their full cells still show unsatisfactory performance with limited energy density and cycle durability. Herein, we report a novel high-performance APB that operates in a sulfuric acid electrolyte with protons commuting between a Cu-Fe Prussian blue analogue cathode and a fused-ring phenazine derivative anode. The fabricated APB full cell exhibits an energy density of up to 52 W h kg(-1), excellent rate performance, and stable cycle life for 10 000 cycles with a capacity retention of similar to 65.2% and a round-trip energy efficiency of 87.1%. The proton storage mechanism is studied by ex situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This work indicates a potential direction to rationally design high-performance APBs.

TI Novel strategy to construct porous Sn-doped
   ZnO/ZnFe2O4 heterostructures for superior
   triethylamine detection
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB The reasonable design of heterostructure is of great significance to the development of high-performance gas sensors for practical applications. Herein, a series of Sn-doped ZnO/ZnFe2O4 (Sn-ZZFO) porous heterostructures were firstly synthesized by doping a certain amount (n wt%) of Sn4+ (n = 1.08, 2.47, and 3.75 for Sn-ZZFO-1-3, respectively) into the Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived ZnO/ZnFe2O4 (ZZFO) heterostructure. As a result, the Sn-ZZFO-2 exhibited excellent triethylamine (TEA) sensing performances at 270 degrees C. Its response value to 10 ppm triethylamine was 28.1, which was ca. 8.0, 4.2 and 4.8 times higher than those of ZZFO, (280 degrees C), Sn-ZZFO-1 and Sn-ZZFO-3, respectively, and even superior to the most of the ZnO-based, 5n0 2 -based, ZnFe2O4 -based and reported ZnO/ZnFe2O4 sensor materials. Moreover, Sn-ZZFO-2 possessed low detection limit (<0.2 ppm), excellent selectivity, and short response and recovery times (9 and 7 s) to TEA. The optimized gas sensing performances to TEA were ascribed to the doping a suitable amount Sn4+ into the ZZFO heterostructure, and the unique Sn-ZZFO-2 multistage pore nanosphere structure. This work highlights an efficient method for preparing porous metal ion doped heterostructures for efficient gas detection.

TI Graphdiyne (g-CnH2n-2) nanosheets encapsulated Cu-Co Prussian blue
   Analogues formed double S-scheme heterojunction for wide spectrum
   photocatalytic H2 evolution
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The frontier of sustainable energy research includes the advancement and creation of stable and efficient photocatalysts for the process of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE). Graphdiyne (GDY), an innovative carbon allotrope, demonstrates a narrow band gap and exceptional photogenerated charge mobility, making it extremely promising in the field of photocatalysis. In addition, Prussian Blue Analogues (PBA) are a unique category of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with open framework structures and strong stability. Compounds formed by ligands and various metal ions in PBA materials exhibit excellent performance. This work primarily enhances wide spectrum PHE by in situ growing GDY nanosheets onto Cu-Co PBA to construct a double S-scheme Cu-Co PBA@GDY/CuI (CCGC) heterojunction. The amorphous GDY can provide abundant active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the nanosheet properties of GDY were confirmed using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The highest PHE rate of Cu-Co PBA@GDY/CuI-10 (CCGC-10) reaches 12947.8 mu mol h-1 g-1 with a apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of is 4.37 % at 520 nm, and exhibits good cycling stability. Based on the bandgap matching theory, the spatial behavior of photogenerated carriers in GDY, CuI, and Cu-Co PBA was effectively controlled, resulting in a close interface with a double S-scheme heterojunction charge transfer in CuCo PBA@GDY/CuI. The S-scheme photogenerated charge transfer pathway in CCGC was further confirmed through in-situ XPS, electron spin resonance (ESR) and work function (Wf). This work proposes a novel approach for the synthesis of solar energy conversion composite photocatalysts based on GDY and PBA.

TI Interplay Between Ni and Fe-ions Substituted Mn-Rich Prussian Blue
   Analogues as a Promising Cathode for High-Energy K-ion Batteries
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB The paradigm shift in energy demands has mandated the development of a feasible alternative and sustainable battery chemistry such as K-ion batteries that deliver the desired energy density and complement the existing expensive Li-ion batteries. Therefore, identifying and improving suitable cathodes with promising stability at high operating voltage is necessary. In this context, a comprehensive analysis was carried out to synthesize Ni and Fe-substituted manganese-based Prussian blue analogues. Structural characterizations revealed the formation of the solid solution by observing the slightly altered unit cell parameters. The simultaneous precipitation of the transition metal ions has resulted in smaller primary particle sizes of similar to 60 nm, facilitating the facile diffusion of K-ions. Simultaneously, the altered local electron distribution in -CN- coordination around the M-N bonds in the transition metal (Ni and Fe) environment has significantly improved the electrochemical performance. The solid solution behavior during (de)potassiation under the competing electrochemically active (Mn and Fe) and inactive (Ni) transition metal substitution has mitigated the detrimental Jahn-Teller effect of Mn2+/3+ and the lowered average discharge potential from 3.75 to 3.72 V vs K/K+. This has ultimately improved the rate capability in PBMNF-712 (K x Mn0.7Ni0.1Fe0.2[Fe(CN)6]) dramatically to 88 mAh/g, whereas PBM (K x Mn[Fe(CN)6]) delivered only 48 mAh/g at a current density of 1000 mA/g with reduced charge transfer resistance. This approach has demonstrated robust cycling stability at 500 mA/g, delivering a specific capacity of 93 mAh/g even after 300 cycles.

TI Prussian blue analogue-derived Ni and Co bimetallic oxide nanoplate
   arrays block-built from porous and hollow nanocubes for the efficient
   oxygen evolution reaction
SO NANOSCALE
AB Effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts composed of Earth-abundant transition metals are crucial for sustainable energy conversion and storage. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable compositions are promising precursors for the fabrication of hollow and porous electrocatalysts. However, pulverous MOFs usually suffer from agglomeration during pyrolysis, greatly reducing the activity of their derived catalysts. In this work, Prussian blue analogue (PBA) arrays with hierarchical multidimensional architecture were directly grown on nickel foam (NF) using a template-oriented method. The subsequent calcination in air allowed for obtaining NixCo3-xO4 nanoplate arrays consisting of porous and hollow nanocubes. The derived bimetallic NixCo3-xO4/NF required only an overpotential of 287 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which is much lower than that of the monometallic NiO and the RuO2 benchmark. The 3D intersectional architecture of the NixCo3-xO4 nanoplates and the porous and hollow nanocube subunits contributed to the large specific surface area and reduced charge-transfer resistance of the NixCo3-xO4/NF electrode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and post-OER characterization revealed that the incorporated Co was the active sites and electrochemical active CoOOH intermediates were in situ formed during the OER. Our study provides a facile and efficient strategy for the rational design of MOF-derived materials towards effective and low-cost electrocatalysis.

TI Design of Prussian blue analogue-derived double-cone structure Ce-Fe
   catalysts and their enhanced performance for the selective catalytic
   reduction of NOx with NH3
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBA) with different structures and adjustable compositions have been recognized as promising materials for catalysis, energy storage, and biological applications. Herein, a simple surface anchoring strategy is proposed to achieve the uniform deposition of CeO2 nanocrystals on the double-cone structure surface of PBA (denoted as Ce@Ce-Fe catalyst) for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3-SCR). Compared with Ce-Fe and Ce@CeO2-Fe2O3, the Ce@Ce-Fe catalyst exhibited the best catalytic activity, widest working temperature window, and highest SO2 tolerance, implying its good application in the process of NH3-SCR. Moreover, the catalysts were characterized systematically to elucidate their surface properties and morphological structure. Taking advantage of the excellent redox performance, unique morphology, mesoporous structure with large surface area and pore diameter, and greater acid content, the Ce@Ce-Fe catalyst exhibited a higher NOx performance. In addition, the Ce@Ce-Fe catalyst also exhibited significant resistance to H2O and SO2 due to its higher content of Fe atoms, implying that Fe plays a critical role in this Ce-Fe based catalytic system. More importantly, the present study indicates that well-dispersed active components and unique architectures can effectively enhance the performance of catalysts.

TI Element screening of metal sites in Fe-based Prussian blue framework
   materials for ammonium ion battery applications: a first-principles
   study
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Prussian blue framework materials are expected to be the next generation of electrode materials for commercial batteries because their three-dimensional framework structures facilitate the rapid transport and storage of ions and a variety of redox processes. This work compared the calculations of the model before and after the dispersion correction, and the model considering the effect of van der Waals force was more stable. In addition, the distances between H, C and N atoms were within the range of van der Waals force. Thus it was confirmed that NH4+ was adsorbed on the Ax site in the Prussian blue framework material (AxMa[Mb(CN)6]) by van der Waals interaction, and the charge transfer was mainly achieved by the interaction between the H atom in NH4+ and the N atom in the Prussian blue framework. On this basis, the properties of NH4+ batteries were theoretically screened for the Fe-based Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with different Ma elements (Ma = Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, V or Zn). Considering the regulating effect of different metal elements on the electronic structures of PBAs, MgFe and ZnFe PBAs as the electrode materials of NH4+ batteries are expected to show excellent electrochemical energy storage performance in organic electrolytes.

TI Boosting oxygen evolution reaction of hierarchical spongy
   NiFe-PBA/Ni3C (B) electrocatalyst: Interfacial engineering
   with matchable structure
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Rational interfacial structure with excellent charge transfer and exposure of numerous active sites plays vital roles in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, a hierarchical spongy electrocatalyst with active NiFe Prussian blue analogues and nickel carbides interface (NiFe-PBA/Ni3C(B)) is proposed and fabricated by a borate-assisted strategy. The unique structure and matchable interface benefit from the desorption of borate ligands in-situ during the pyrolysis and carbonization process. The optimal electrocatalyst composing of metal-organic framework (NiFe prussian blue analogues) in conjunction with a metallic transition carbide phase (nickel carbide) exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of only 196 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 30.1 mV dec(-1) for OER in KOH. The robust water oxidation performance can be ascribed to the abundant adsorption sites and effective interfacial interaction. In addition, computational simulations further confirm that NiFe-PBA/Ni3C(B) is favorable for OER since the optimized electronic distribution and metal-3d orbitals interact around Fermi level at the interface. This research provides a new insight into rationally designing efficient electrocatalysts via morphology engineering and integrating different functional phase with complementary advantages for catalysis application.

TI Hollow NiF2/CoF2 cubes as electrode materials for
   high-performance supercapacitors
SO SOLID STATE SCIENCES
AB In this paper, NiF2/CoF2 composites with hollow cubic structures were fabricated with Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a template, which were characterized by using XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and EDS mapping. Electrochemical properties of obtained samples were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. Results show that the hollow NiF2/CoF2 cubes possess commendable specific capacitance of 1491.1 F/g at the current density of 1A/g. Meanwhile, they deliver excellent rate capability (77.2% capacity retention from 1 to 10 A/g) and remarkable cycling stability with 78.7% specific capacitance retention after 3000 cycles at 5 A/g. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique hollow cubic structure and the coupling of nickel and cobalt. This work indicates that NiF2/CoF2 composites can be a promising electrode material for the high-performance supercapacitor.

TI Scale Activity Relationship of
   MnOx-FeOy Nanocage Catalysts Derived
   from Prussian Blue Analogues for Low-Temperature NO Reduction:
   Experimental and DFT Studies
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Size effects have been recognized to promote the catalytic activity and selectivity of metal oxide particles. So far, limited works and studies are conducted to investigate the size effect of metal oxide with the tailored shape in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3-SCR). Herein, the MnOx,-FeOy nanocage catalysts with varied scales (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mu m) were synthesized via a Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived method and used for NH3-SCR of NO. By preforming a series of the activity tests over the nanocages with different scales, the NH3-SCR activity of 0.5 mu m MnOx-FeOy nanocage catalysts exhibits the highest deNO(x) activity in the temperature range of 80-200 degrees C owing to more preferable physical and chemical properties. It has been demonstrated, that there is a strong interaction among Mn and Fe cations in the 0.5 mu m MnOx FeOy nanocages. Moreover, the H-2-TPR and XPS analysis prove 0.5 mu m nanocages exhibit excellent redox properties, which contribute to the higher conservation of NOx. Through the DFT studies, it is also demonstrated that the 0.5 mu m MnOx-FeOy nanocage catalysts could provide more preferable electronic charge, which gives rise to the varied adsorption behavior of the NH3 species and NO, species, compared to the nanocages with other scales. The in situ DRIFTs were also employed to evaluate the adsorption status of NH3 with NOx species over MnOx-FeOy nanocage catalysts with varied scales. Finally, the scale-activity relationship of the MnOx-FeOy nanocage catalysts and their corresponding activities are also established. The deep insight into the scale-activity relationship of the PM-derived MnQ(x)-FeOy,nanocage catalyst paves the way for developing and designing highly efficient Mn-based catalyst at lower temperature.

TI PBA-loaded albite-base ceramic foam in application to adsorb harmful
   ions of Cd, Cs and As(V) in water
SO MULTIDISCIPLINE MODELING IN MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an investigation on a new kind of adsorbent materials, namely, the Prussian blue analog (PBA)-loaded albite-base porous ceramic foam, which can effectively adsorb the heavy metal ion in the wastewater. Design/methodology/approach The natural zeolite powder has been used as the primary raw material to make a sort of porous ceramic foam by impregnating polymer foam in slurry and then sintering. Adjusting the technological parameters could control the bulk density of the ceramic product, which could float on water with the bulk density less than 1 g/cm(3) and also sink in water with the bulk density higher than 1 g/cm(3). After desilicating the porous ceramic foam, an Al-Fe type PBA with a strong function of ion exchange was loaded on the ceramic surface by directly yielding. Findings The adsorption performance for harmful metal ions was greatly improved by combining together the high adsorption capability of the PB analog and the efficient high specific surface area of the porous ceramic foam. Originality/value This work presents a PBA-loaded albite-base porous ceramic foam that can effectively adsorb the harmful substance in water, and the adsorption efficiency for some typical harmful ions, i.e., Cd2+, Cs+ and As(V), was examined under different conditions of the experimental period, the pH value and the ion concentration in the tested solution.

TI Porous prussian blue analogs derived nickel-iron bimetallic phosphide
   nanocubes on conductive hollow mesoporous carbon nanospheres for stable
   and flexible high-performance supercapacitor electrode
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Nickel-iron bimetallic phosphide (Ni-Fe-P) is the ideal battery-type materials for supercapacitor in virtue of high theoretical specific capacitance. Nevertheless, its actual adhibition is astricted on account of inferior rate capability and cyclic stability. Herein, we constructed hierarchical core-shell nanocomposites with hollow mesoporous carbon nanospheres (HMCS) packaged via prussian blue analogs derived Ni-Fe-P nanocubes (Ni-FeP@HMCS), as a positive electrode for hybrid supercapacitor (HSC). Profiting from the cooperative effects of NiFe-P nanocubes with small size and good dispersibility, and HMCS with continuously conductive network, the NiFe-P@HMCS composite electrode with abundantly porous architectures presents an ultrahigh gravimetric specific capacity for 739.8 C g- 1 under 1 A g-1. Specially, the Ni-Fe-P@HMCS electrode presents outstanding rate capability of 78.4% (1 A g-1 to 20 A g-1) and cyclic constancy for 105% after 5000 cycles. Density functional theory implies that the composite electrode possesses higher electrical conductivity than bare Ni-Fe-P electrode by reason of the incremental charge density, and the electrons transferring from NiFe3P4 to HMCS layers. Additionally, the assembled Ni-Fe-P@HMCS//HMCS HSC facility delivers the high energy density for 64.1 Wh kg-1, remarkable flexibility and mechanical stability. Thus, this work proffers a viable and efficacious measure to construct ultra-stability electrode for high-performance portable electronic facilities.

TI An XAFS study of Cs adsorption by the precipitation bands of Mn-Fe-based
   Prussian blue analogues spontaneously formed in agarose gel
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The adsorption of Cs+ ions by the precipitation bands of a Mn-Fe based Prussian blue analogue (Mn-Fe PBA) that form spontaneously in agarose gel was investigated by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) distribution analysis. Two gel samples were prepared by contacting a gel containing 0.05 M [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) and 2.3 mass% agarose with a 0.50 M MnSO4 solution, into one of which a 0.10 M CsCl solution was introduced. The SEM images and the XRF intensity distributions reveal that Mn-Fe PBA forms cubic crystallites (approx. 3 x 3 x 3 mu m in size) in the gels that trap Cs+ ions with considerably high affinity. Cs L-3-edge and Mn K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra, which were analyzed with the aid of FEFF simulations, strongly suggest that Cs adsorption occurs at relatively large defect sites close to the sub-cube faces in the PBA. This suggestion is supported by Cs L-3-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which suggested that the first and second coordination shells around the Cs+ ions are at a Cs-O distance of 0.35 +/- 0.02 nm and a Cs-N distance of 0.43 +/- 0.01 nm, respectively, with coordination numbers of 1.5 +/- 0.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.5. The Mn K-edge XANES data also suggest that H2O molecules, which initially occupy many cubic centers in the Mn-Fe PBAs, are mostly displaced during Cs adsorption. These findings provide valuable insight toward fully understanding Cs adsorption by Mn-Fe PBA.

TI Epitaxial Core-Shell MnFe Prussian Blue Cathode for Highly Stable
   Aqueous Zinc Batteries
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB The high-safety aqueous zinc battery is regarded as a desirable alternative to lithium-ion batteries; however, it still lacks sufficient cycling capability. The primary impediment is structural distortion of cathode materials in aqueous electrolytes. Here we propose an epitaxial Fe- on Mnhexacyanoferrate to construct a core-shell double-atom-redox Prussian blue analogue (PBA). The shell Fe-PBA shows a small volumetric change, inclined toward surface amorphization upon ion-insertion, leading to the low-strain core-double shell structure. The in situ surface reorganization effectively suppresses Jahn-Teller distortion and prevents Mn dissolution into electrolyte in the core Mn-PBA. Consequently, the cathode design that facilitates high-voltage full cells (over 1.8 V vs Zn2+/ Zn) enables a high discharge capacity of 166 and 117 mAh g(-1) and a capacity retention of 72.4% and 83.9% over 400 and 4800 cycles at 0.1 and 2 A g(-1), respectively. A pouch cell operates successfully under harsh conditions from -30 to 60 degrees C.

TI Universal Strategy for Preparing Highly Stable
   PBA/Ti3C2Tx MXene toward
   Lithium-Ion Batteries via Chemical Transformation
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are believed to be intriguing anode materials for Li+ storage because of their tunable composition, designable topologies, and tailorable porous structures, yet they suffer from severe capacity decay and inferior cycling stability due to the volume variation upon lithiation and high electrical resistance. Herein, we develop a universal strategy for synthesizing small PBA nanoparticles hosted on two-dimensional (2D) MXene or rGO (PBA/MX or PBA/rGO) via an in situ transformation from ultrathin layered double hydroxides (LDH) nanosheets. 2D conductive nanosheets allow for fast electron transport and guarantee the full utilization of PBA even at high rates; at the meantime, PBA nanoparticles effectively prevent 2D materials from restacking and facilitate rapid ion diffusion. The optimized Ni0.8Mn0.2-PBA/MX as an anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) delivers a capacity of 442 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and an excellent cycling robustness in comparison with bare PBA bulk crystals. We believe that this study offers an alternative choice for rationally designing PBA-based electrode materials for energy storage.

   graphite carbon for high performance supercapacitor
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In this paper, the unique 3D N-doped graphite carbon-encapsulated Co/Co9S8 (CN-Co/Co9S8 ) was synthesized by thermal decomposition using Co-Co prussian blue analogue (PBA) as template and precursor in C3H6 atmo-sphere and hydrothermal method. CN-Co/Co(9)S(8 )is composed of secondary nanoparticles with core-shell structure, which have outstanding abundance of active sites and high porosity. Due to the virtue of stable core-shell structure, abundant defects and high theoretical specific capacitance, CN-Co/Co(9)S(8 )produced at 0.05 L min(-1) C3H6 shows high specific capacitance of 334F/g at 1 A/g and excellent rate capability with 78 % capacitance retention (from 1 to 20 A/g). The maximum energy density of the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is 38.3 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1). In general, a novel and effective strategy to design and fabricate Co9S8 nanostructured electrodes with higher capacitance and rate capability was invented, expecting to be applied in the field of environmentally friendly and high-performance energy storage.

TI Pressure-tuning of the photomagnetic response of heterostructured
   CoFe@CrCr-PBA core@shell nanoparticles
SO POLYHEDRON
AB Using a home-made, anvil pressure-cell mounted to a probe suitable for use with a commercial magnetometer, the photo and thermal responses of the magnetism of CoFe@CrCr-PBA (PBA = Prussian blue analogue) core@shell nanoparticles were studied down to 5 K and up to 0.5 GPa in 100 G. The effect of pressure on the magnetic ordering temperatures of the CoFe-PBA core (approximate to 25 K) and the CrCr-PBA shell (approximate to 200 K) along with a shift of the relaxation temperature of the photo-CTIST (charge-transfer-induced spin-transition) of the CoFe-PBA core (approximate to 125 K), were similar to the behaviors reported for the singlephase materials. Specifically, although the magnetic ordering temperature of the CrCr-PBA shell shifted to higher temperatures, the relaxation temperature of the photo-CTIST of the CoFe-PBA core moved to lower temperatures when the pressure was increased, thereby lowering the temperature range under which the CrCr-PBA component can be photoswitched.

TI Co-precipitation synthesis control for sodium ion adsorption capacity
   and cycle life of copper hexacyanoferrate electrodes in battery
   electrode deionization
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue analogues are being explored as electrode materials for electrochemical desalination of saline water in battery-type electrode deionization systems and hybrid capacitive deionization systems due to their open framework crystal structure that provides selective adsorption of multiple cations, high theoretical sodium adsorption capacities, and low costs. However, poor electronic conductivity and instability (dissolution) prevents the use of these materials for long-term desalination applications. To understand how synthesis conditions might improve the properties of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) powders relative to sodium ion adsorption capacity and cycle life, the co-precipitation process was investigated using multiple common synthesis strategies that included addition of chelators and sodium salts as well as different concentrations and oxidation states of precursors. Smaller crystallite sizes (< 35 nm) and lower structural water contents increased the initial sodium removal capacity to 53.2 mAh/g from 40.4 mAh/g (control), but also reduced cycling stability in long-term operation (20-55% retention over 100 cycles). The trade-off in stability is thought to be a consequence of structural water facilitating ion diffusion within the material. Adding chelators as precursors led to a highly reversible Cu-II/Cu-I redox couple that increased the stability of the Fe-III/Fe(II )redox couple in BDI cycling performance (79.4% retention over 100 cycles).

TI Nano-Ni/Co-PBA as high-performance cathode material for aqueous
   sodium-ion batteries
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are reliable and promising cathode materials for aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) owing to their open three-dimensional frameworks, outstanding stability, and low production costs. However, PBAs containing only a single type of transition-metal ion often have limited charge-storage capacities in aqueous systems. This study reports the first example of K0.11Ni0.39Co0.79[Fe(CN)6]& BULL;2.04H2O nanoparticles (Ni/Co-PBA) being used as a high-capacity cathode material for ASIBs. Owing to multi-electron redox reactions involving Co and Fe ions, Ni/Co-PBA has an initial capacity of 65 mAh g-1 and a capacity retention rate of 80% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1, indicating its outstanding cycle performance and capacity retention. Ex-situ x-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique were used to analyze the redox mechanisms and kinetics of Ni/Co-PBA. Ni/Co-PBA-based ASIBs are among the most promising energy-storage technologies for large-scale fixed energy-storage systems because of their outstanding electrochemical performance, low costs, and high efficiency.

TI Prussian blue analogue derived magnetic Cu-Fe oxide as a recyclable
   photo-Fenton catalyst for the efficient removal of sulfamethazine at
   near neutral pH values
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The presence of antibiotics in aquatic environments has attracted global concern. Heterogeneous photo-Fenton process is an attractive yet challenging method for antibiotics degradation, especially when such a process can be operated at neutral pH values. In this work, a new magnetic Cu-Fe oxide (CuFeO) was developed as the heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalyst through a facile two-step method. The obtained CuFeO particles were found to be more efficient to activate H2O2 into radicals (% OH and center dot O-2(-)) than Cu-Fe Prussian blue analogue (Cu-Fe PBA, the precursor) at near neutral conditions. The removal rate of sulfamethazine (SMZ) in CuFeO/H2O2/Vis system was much higher than those in CuO/H2O2/Vis and Fe3O4/H2O2/Vis systems. It was observed that nearly complete removal of SMZ from ultrapure water, river water and tap water can be achieved in 30 min in CuFeO/H2O2/Vis system. The influence of different process parameters on the SMZ degradation efficiency was then examined and the catalytic stability of CuFeO was also tested. The SMZ degradation intermediates during the process were analyzed and the degradation pathway was proposed based on LC-MS results. The mechanisms for H2O2 activation were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectrum analysis, radical scavenging and electron spin-trapping experiments. It is suggested that the synergistic effect among photo-induced electrons, Cu and Fe in CuFeO exhibits excellent performance in the catalytic activation of H2O2. This work is expected to provide useful information for the design and synthesis of bimetallic oxide for heterogeneous photo-Fenton reactions.

TI A Na-rich manganese hexacyanoferrate hollow nano-cube with low crystal
   water and few defects for efficient Zn ion storage in aqueous batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have competitive advantages as cathode materials for aqueous rechargeable batteries, including stable framework structures, regulated redox sites, and straightforward synthesis methods. However, in most cases, there are vacancies and coordinated/interstitial water molecules in the framework of PBAs. This not only reduces the active sites but also makes their structure susceptible to collapse during the charge-discharge process, leading to low specific capacity and poor cycling stability. In this work, a favorable cathode material of Na1.39Mn[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot 1.2H(2)O (denoted as RNMHCF-H) equipped with abundant Na content, low crystal water and few defects was successfully prepared by a simple co-precipitable method. The RNMHCF-H exhibits a greatly improved capacity of 151.4 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), good rate performance and impressive stability performance in aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs). Furthermore, multifaceted characterization techniques were used to reveal the process and mechanism of Zn2+ storage in RNMHCF-H, and it was found that both manganese and iron participate in the electrochemical redox reaction during the charging/discharging process.

TI 3D nanocubes NiCo-PBA sulfide for high-performance supercapacitors
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB In this work, 3D nanocubes NiCo-PBA sulfide (NiCoS-PBA) has been prepared by ammonia solution etching and vulcanizing for NiCo-Prussian blue analogue (NiCo-PBA) homemade. The SEM and TEM show that the obtained NiCoS-PBA has the 3D nanocubes structure with rough surface and inward depressions. Electrochemical analysis indicates that an ultrahigh specific capacitance of NiCoS-PBA is 965 C g-1 at 1 A g-1, which is better than that of NiCo-PBA# (256 C g-1), only sulfurized NiCoS-PBA# (369 C g-1) and only etched NiCo-PBA (281 C g-1) at the same condition. This is thanks to the 3D nanocubes structure, which has large accessible areas and rich active sites for redox reactions to enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Meanwhile, this also illustrates that the etching and vulcanizing treatments can significantly boost the specific capacitance of NiCoSPBA. Additionally, the NiCoS-PBA-based asymmetric supercapacitor (ACS) device offers an energy density of 61.7 Wh kg- 1 at a power density of 800.1 W kg -1. It is believed that NiCoS-PBA will be a strong contender as an electrode material in supercapacitors.

TI Nanozymes 'artificial peroxidase' in reduction and detection of organic
   peroxides
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian Blue based nanozymes are able to catalyze reduction of organic peroxides similarly to the enzyme peroxidase. For the whole range of peroxides under study the catalytic rate constant for 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylben-zidine in case of nanozymes is significantly higher as compared to horseradish peroxidase. Moreover, the selectivity of nanozymes towards hydrogen peroxide relatively organic peroxides reduction is higher than that for the enzyme, which can be explained in terms of different ability of peroxides to penetrate to the bulk of catalytically synthesized Prussian Blue nanoparticles. On the contrary, selectivity of Prussian Blue film modified electrodes is much lower and even negligible among hydrogen, urea and methyl ethyl ketone peroxides. An ability to tune the selectivity would allow individual detection of peroxides in their complex mixtures with Prussian Blue nanostructures.

TI Hyaluronic acid modified prussian blue analogs/TiO2 janus nanostructures
   through efficient charge separation to enhance photocatalytic-driven
   dual gas for achieve multimodal treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the abnormal proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes and changes in the joint synovium, including elevated reactive oxygen species, decreased pH, and reduced oxygen content. In this study, we synthesized a novel nanocomposite material, namely HA-PBA-TiO2 Janus nanocomposite, by in situ etching in prussian blue analogs doped with Co and Ni, followed by the growth of TiO2 nano-flowers and encapsulation in hyaluronic acid. When these janus nanoparticles diffused to the inflammatory sites of RA, they exhibited outstanding photocatalytic water-splitting ability under 660 nm laser irradiation, generating H2 and O2. This capability helps ameliorate the hypoxic microenvironment at RA inflammatory sites by eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhancing antioxidation and oxygenation. Furthermore, owing to the doping of Co and Ni, HA-PBA-TiO2 exhibits photothermal conversion capability, which significant damage to FLS upon exposure to 660 nm laser irradiation, thereby controlling their aberrant proliferation. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we validated the significant therapeutic efficacy of HA-PBA-TiO2 in treating RA, highlighting its broad prospects for application.

TI Hierarchical sodium-rich Prussian blue hollow nanospheres as
   high-performance cathode for sodium-ion batteries
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Recently, Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) have attracted tremendous attention as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of their good cycling performance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, they still suffer from kinetic problems associated with the solid-state diffusion of sodium ions during charge and discharge processes, which leads to low specific capacity and poor rate performances. In this work, novel sodium iron hexacyanoferrate nanospheres with a hierarchical hollow architecture have been fabricated as cathode material for sodium-ion batteries by a facile template method. Due to the unique hollow sphere morphology, sodium iron hexacyanoferrate nanospheres can provide large numbers of active sites and high diffusion dynamics for sodium ions, thus delivering a high specific capacity (142 mAh/g), a superior rate capability, and an excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, the sodium insertion/extraction mechanism has been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction, which provides further insight into the crystal structure change of the sodium iron hexacyanoferrate nanosphere cathode material during charge and discharge processes.

AB Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in electrochemical water splitting on industrial scale, which suffers from the slow kinetics and large overpotential, thus setting the main obstacle for efficient water electrolysis. To pursue cost-effective OER electrocatalysts with high activity and durable stability, we here set a facile strategy to prepare N-doped graphene supported core-shell FeNi alloy@N-doped carbon nanocages (FeNi@NC-NG) by annealing graphene oxides supported Prussian blue analogues under H-2/Ar atmosphere. Based on the specific structural benefits, the present catalyst shows superior OER catalytic activity than precious metal catalyst of RuO2 and Ir/C, with a low overpotential of 270 mV for 10 mA cm(-2), as well as high stability. The simple synthesis process and outstanding electrocatalytic performances show great potential of FeNi@NC-NG to replace the noble metal-based catalysts toward electrochemical water oxidation.

TI Exploring the economic viability of electrochemical assessment for water
   contaminants with NiFe-PBA/ZIF-67 core shell modified GCE
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Zeolitic Imidazolate (metal organic) Frameworks (ZIFs) and Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) are promising materials in electrochemical sensing due to their unique properties. In this study, a composite material comprising NiFe-PBA and ZIF-67 was synthesized and made to form a uniform layer onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to enhance electrochemical performance for furazolidone (FZD) detection. The synthesized NiFePBA/ZIF-67 composite exhibited excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and stability towards FZD detection, with a low limit of detection (LOD). The electrochemical behaviour of FZD on the NiFe-PBA/ZIF-67/GCE electrode was investigated, revealing a diffusion-controlled process. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) analysis demonstrated the synergetic effect of the PBA/MOF core-shell structure in enhancing FZD electro-reduction. The sensor exhibited exceptional LOD of 0.007 mu M. Selectivity studies confirmed the sensor's ability to distinguish FZD from potential interferents. Extensive evaluations demonstrated the sensor's reproducibility, repeatability, and longterm stability, affirming its practical utility. Real sample analysis further validated the sensor's excellent analytical capabilities in diverse matrices.

TI Insight into Electrochemical Properties and Reaction Mechanism of a
   Cobalt-Rich Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode in a
   NaSO3CF3 Electrolyte for Aqueous Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Prussian-blue analogues attract significant interest as cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their open-framework structure and good cycling stability in aqueous electrolytes, but they usually suffer from low practical specific capacities (similar to 70 mA h g(-1)). Herein, the electrochemical properties of the nanostructured Na2Co0.8Ni0.2[Fe(CN)(6)] compound in a high-concentration NaSO3CF3 electrolyte are systematically investigated by the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic technique. It is found that the material delivers a high reversible capacity of 116.4 mA h g(-1) at the current of 50 mA g(-1) and a working potential of 0.67 V (vs Ag/AgCl) on average, achieving a high theoretical specific energy of 171 W h kg(-1) in aqueous SIBs with a NaTi2(PO4)(3) anode. In particular, it exhibits good cycling performance with a capacity retention of 88% after continuously charging/ discharging for 100 cycles at the current of 100 mA g(-1). Furthermore, the reaction mechanism is understood by combining ex situ X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Experimental results reveal that the material undergoes an initial structural transformation from the rhombohedral phase to the cubic phase, and a subsequent solid-solution mechanism in a wide potential range, through reversible chemistry of Co3+/Co2+ and Fe3+/Fe2- redox couples. The findings of this work open up more opportunities for designing high-energy aqueous SIBs.

TI In-situ-grown Co-doped Ni-hexacyanoferrate/Ni-foam composites as
   battery-type electrode materials for aqueous hybrid supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), a class of metal-organic materials, are gaining much importance as battery-type electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), owing to their open-framework structure and high power density. In this work, which considers Ni-hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) as a PBA subsystem, Co -doped NiHCF/ Ni-foam (NF) composites are synthesized through a simple hydrothermal process and their structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties are studied. The Co0.7Ni0.3HCF/NF electrodes exhibit improved battery-like behavior with excellent electrochemical performance, cycling stability, and specific capacitance. The HSC fabricated with Co0.7Ni0.3HCF/NF as the positive electrode and an activated carbon cloth as the negative electrode produces a high power density of 3938 W kg(-1) at an energy density of 13 Wh kg(-1). These results emphasize that the proposed composite is a promising candidate as an electrode material and that it is well-suited for the development of supercapacitors. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Sodium titanium hexacyanoferrate as an environmentally friendly and
   low-cost cathode material for sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB A new type of Prussian blue analog, sodium titanium hexacyanoferrate, has been synthesized with good electrochemical performance using an environmentally friendly, solution precipitation method. Because of the hydrolysis reaction of titanium, it has been proved that the synthetic reaction is sensitive to heat, and the best reaction temperature is 60 degrees C. The resulting particles belong to a well-defined open framework with cubic structure. Because of the two sodium storage sites provided by the low-spin [Fe(CN)(6)](4-/3-) couple and high-spin Ti3+/4+ couple, sodium titanium hexacyanoferrate exhibits a high specific capacity over 90 mAh g(-1), and two pairs of clear charge/discharge platforms at 3.0 V/2.6 V and 3.4 V/3.2 V, respectively. The results show that this material can be applied as a low-cost cathode electrode with good electrochemical performance for sodium ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cobalt-doped iron-based Prussian blue analogue cubes anchored to
   phosphorus-nitrogen-covered BN surfaces for enhancing the flame
   retardancy of epoxy coatings
SO PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS
AB Prussian blue analogue (PBA) is considered to be a very promising inorganic nano-flame retardant material due to its structure enriched with transition metal elements. Here, hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) and pphenylenediamine (p-PDA) were first loaded onto the boron nitride surface (BN/PCP) via a polymerization reaction to impart richer flame retardant characteristics. Then, Co-Fe-based PBA nanoparticles were homogeneously anchored on the BN/PCP surface to obtain the BN/PCP@PBA hierarchical nano-flame retardant. It is worth mentioning that this novel composite flame retardant effectively combined the superior barrier properties of BN, fire retardancy of N, P elements and the accelerated carbon conversion effect of Co-Fe/PBA. The test results showed that the loading of PCP on the BN surface could effectively improve the thermal insulation performance of EP, while Co-Fe/PBA had good catalytic carbon formation effect at high temperature. Specifically, the backside of the BN/PCP@PBA filled EP sample displayed the lowest temperature during flame attack (164.1 degrees C) compared to the other specimens, proving its best thermal insulation. The BN/PCP@PBA/EP obtained the maximum expansion height and expansion rate values (27.6 mm and 21.07) in the furnace chamber experiments, which are crucial for its fire resistance. In addition, BN/PCP@PBA/EP retained the highest residual char (32.6 %) and achieved the lowest smoke density rating (36.9 %), demonstrating its high carbon conversion and fume suppression. Carbon residue analysis confirmed that the char layer of BN/PCP@PBA/EP was more complete and the metal oxides were uniformly embedded in the carbon residue skeleton, which ensured good flame protection for the substrate.

TI Core-Shell Heterostructured CuFe@FeFe Prussian Blue Analogue Coupling
   with Silver Nanoclusters via a One-Step Bioinspired Approach:
   Efficiently Nonlabeled Aptasensor for Detection of Bleomycin in Various
   Aqueous Environments
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB We synthesized novel core-shell heterostructured Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanospheres coupled with silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) via a one-step bioinspired approach and further exploited these as aptasensors for the detection of a trace antibiotic, bleomycin (BLM). Using FeFe Prussian blue (FeFe PB) as the core, a bimetallic CuFe@FeFe PBA layer was prepared by coupling with AgNCs synthesized by taking the BLM-targeted aptamer as a template (denoted by AgNCs/Apt@CuFe@FeFe). The coupling of AgNCs/Apt via a one-step bioinspired approach not only can improve the sensing performance of CuFe@FeFe-based aptasensors but also can shorten the aptasensor fabrication procedure. Due to the strong coordination interaction between abundant Fe(II) ions contained in CuFe@FeFe PBA nanospheres and BLM (represented by Fe(II)center dot BLM), the Fe(II)center dot BLM complex formed enables aptamer strands to undergo an irreversible cleavage event that can result in a significant change in electrochemical activity. Electrochemical results displayed that both CuFe@FeFe- and AgNCs/Apt@CuFe@FeFe-based aptasensors exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, good stability and reproducibility, and acceptable applicability toward BLM. In comparison with the pristine CuFe@FeFe-based aptasensor (limit of detection (LOD) = 0.49 fg mL(-1) within the BLM concentration from 1.0 to 2.0 ng mL(-1)), the as -prepared AgNCs/Apt@CuFe@FeFe-based aptasensor gave a extremely lower LOD value of 0.0082 fg mL(-1) within a relatively narrow BLM concentration range (0.01 fg mL(-1) to 0.1 pg mL(-1)). The proposed method can broaden the application of PBA nanomaterials in food safety and biosensing fields and provides a potential determination method for rapidly detecting BLM in various aqueous environments.

TI Hydrothermal Recrystallization as a Strategy to Reveal the Structural
   Diversity in Hexacyanometallates: Nickel and Copper Hexacyanoosmates(II)
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The results discussed herein reinforce the relevance of the hydrothermal recrystallization in transition metal hexacyanometallates as a suitable strategy to access the structural diversity of this family of coordination polymers. Copper(2+) and nickel(2+) hexacyanoosmates(II) were prepared by the precipitation method using hexacyanoosmic(II) acid as the complex anion source, obtaining powders of insufficient crystalline quality for the structural study. These powders were then recrystallized under hydrothermal conditions. For Ni, three new phases where formed, monoclinic and tetragonal, and a hexagonal modification when the monoclinic one is dehydrated under soft heating. For copper, one new tetragonal phase was found, in addition to the previously reported cubic one, typical of Prussian blue analogues. The crystal structure for these four nickel and cooper hexacyanoosmates(II) were solved and refined ab initio from powder XRD data. The refined crystal structures are properly supported by a detailed spectroscopic study from IR and UV/Vis data, Ligand Field Analysis, and thermal, magnetic and hydrogen adsorption measurements. In the anhydrous phase for nickel, neighboring Ni atoms were found coordinated by bifurcated N end, an atypical coordination mode for the CN- ligand. The results herein discussed contribute to shed light on the vast information unrevealed on the coordination chemistry of transition metal hexacyanometallates.

TI Enwrapping graphdiyne (g-CnH2n-2) on
   hollow NiCo2O4 nanocages derived from a Prussian
   blue analogue as a p-n heterojunction for highly efficient
   photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Graphdiyne (GDY) has shown promising application prospects in the photocatalytic splitting of water into hydrogen (H-2). In this work, a new carbon material of GDY was prepared by a reduction elimination reaction assisted by ball milling, and then it was introduced into NiCo2O4 by cryogenic mixing. A novel NiCo2O4@GDY p-n heterojunction was designed and synthesized, showing an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen performance of 4.84 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is 4.84 and 6.91 times that of GDY and NiCo2O4, respectively. The improved hydrogen evolution efficiency can be attributed to the built-in electric field establishment between GDY and NiCo2O4, which remarkably promotes the transfer and separation of photoexcitons. Additionally, the unique nanocage structure of Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived NiCo2O4 can increase the reflection/refraction efficiency of incident light and increase the utilization of sunlight. The possible mechanism at the NiCo2O4@GDY p-n heterojunction was proposed and discussed in combination with in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI-XPS), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy, valence band XPS (VB-XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a whole, this work provides an effective strategy for the construction of a p-n heterojunction based on graphdiyne and PBA derivatives to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

TI An enzyme-free immunosensor for sensitive determination of procalcitonin
   using NiFe PBA nanocubes@TB as the sensing matrix
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB In this work, a label-free electrochemical immunosensor was developed for the detection of procalcitonin (PCT), using toluidine blue functionalized NiFe Prussian-blue analog nano-cubes (NiFe PBA nanocubes@TB) as a signal amplifier. NiFe PBA nanocubes was synthesized by a simple and efficient self-templating method in this work. NiFe PBA nanocubes with open-framework construction not only provides a larger specific area to load a mass of antibodies but produces an excellent signal without adding extra reaction reagent. Besides, the electrochemical performance of NiFe PBA nanocubes can be enhanced after functionalized with TB. The developed immunosensor exhibited favorable performance for PCT detection with a linear range from 0.001 to 25 ng mL(-1) and a detection limit of 3 x 10(-4) ng ml(-1). Moreover, the immunosensor with acceptable reproducibility, selectivity, and stability may provide a new strategy in the clinical detection of PCT. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Structure Distortion Induced Monoclinic Nickel Hexacyanoferrate as
   High-Performance Cathode for Na-Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Prussian blue analogs with an open framework are ideal cathodes for Na-ion batteries. A superior high-rate and highly stable monoclinic nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF-3) is synthesized via a facile one-step crystallization-controlled co-precipitation method. It gives a high specific capacity of 85.7 mAh g(-1), nearly to its theoretical value. It also exhibits an excellent rate capability with a high capacity retention ratio of 78% at 50 C and a stable cycling performance over 1200 cycles. Through the ex situ X-ray diffraction and pair distribution function measurements, it is found that the monoclinic structure with distorted framework is greatly related to the high Na content. The electronic structure studies by density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrate that NiHCF-3 deformation promotes the framework conductivity and improves the electrochemical activity of Fe, which results in an ultrahigh-rate performance of monoclinic phase. Furthermore, the high-quality monoclinic (NiHCF-3) exhibits excellent compatibility with both hard carbon and NaTi2(PO4)(3) anodes in full cells, which shows great prospects for the application in the large-scale energy storage systems.

TI Pd modified prussian blue frameworks: Multiple electron transfer
   pathways for improving catalytic activity toward hydrogenation of
   nitroaromatics
SO MOLECULAR CATALYSIS
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) exhibit potential as low-cost and eco-friendly nanocatalysts that can be fabricated with ease. However, the PBA framework structure suffers from poor electronic conductivity, which limits the catalytic efficiency for this class of materials. Noble metals represent an alternative class of materials that display inherent catalytic activity but suffer from aggregation, ultimately reducing the amount of accessible catalytic sites. Herein, we demonstrate a combinatory approach that circumvents the known disadvantages with these classes of catalytic materials in which PBA-supported nanocatalysts were synthesized. These composite materials exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of nitroaromatics to aminoaromatics while displaying longterm cycling stability, which is attributed to the availability of multiple electron transfer pathways. Overall, this work opens the study on the assembly of PBA-supported heterogeneous nanocatalysts and potentially paves the way toward future applications.

TI Facile synthesis of Mesoporouscobalt Hexacyanoferrate Nanocubes for
   High-Performance Supercapacitors
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Mesoporous cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanocubes (meso-CoHCF) were prepared for the first time through a facile sacrificial template method. The CoHCF mesostructures possess a high specific surface area of 548.5 m(2).g(-1) and a large amount of mesopores, which enable fast mass transport of electrolyte and abundant energy storage sites. When evaluated as supercapacitor materials, the meso-CoHCF materials exhibit a high specific capacitance of 285 F.g(-1), good rate capability and long cycle life with capacitance retention of 92.9% after 3000 cycles in Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The excellent electrochemical properties demonstrate the rational preparation of mesoporous prussian blue and its analogues for energy storage applications.

TI A mini review on cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY
AB Sodium-ion batteries are becoming potential solutions for replacement of batteries due to the abundance of sodium reserves and high recycling costs of lithium-based batteries. Sodium-based layered oxides are being widely explored as positive electrode material for sodium-ion battery due to their high capacities and high energy densities. However, oxide-based systems do suffer from thermal stability issues and exhibit low power density. On the other hand, polyanionic-based compounds and Prussian blue analogues demonstrate appreciable thermal stabilities and are useful in high power density applications. This article reviews recent trends of these cathode materials.

TI Unlocking the electrochemical ammonium storage performance of copper
   intercalated hexacyanoferrate
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The aqueous NH4+ batteries (AAIBs) have fascinated significant attention because of their excellent safety, small cost, fast diffusion kinetics, and environmental friendliness. It is essential to develop high-performance electrode materials that can stably exist during the rapid ammoniation/deammoniation processes. Iron-based Prussian blue (PBA) possesses significant application potential in AAIBs due to its considerable theoretical capacity and the abundant availability of iron ore resources. Nevertheless, the capacity contribution from the low-spin Fe2+/Fe3+ coupling is relatively modest, and the presence of Fe(CN)(6) vacancies and crystalline water significantly diminishes the active sites for NH4+, adversely impacting the electrochemical performance of AAIBs. The substitution of Cu can partially stabilize the crystalline structure of the material and help mitigate side reactions. Herein, a CuFe Prussian blue analog (CuFe-PBA) nanomaterial with a grain size of similar to 100 nm prepared by an easy coprecipitation pathway is described as a high-performance cathode for AAIBs. The electrochemically inactive Cu2+ raises the reaction potential, enhancing the stability of the battery. The material exhibits exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 74.5 % of its initial capacity after stable cycling for 20,000 cycles at 10 A g(-1) , which corresponds to a low-capacity attenuation of 0.0013 % per cycle. These results provide new insights for the development of low-cost, long-life cathode for AAIBs.

TI A Cyanide-Based Coordination Polymer for Hydrogen Evolution
   Electrocatalysis
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB Research on H-2 production has recently been directed to the development of cost-efficient and robust heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Given the promising catalytic activities of several cobalt-based systems and the robustness of Prussian blue analogues in harsh catalytic processes including water oxidation, a Co-Co Prussian blue analogue was investigated as a HER catalyst for the first time. Co-Co Prussian Blue modified fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode demonstrated a significant HER activity with an onset overpotential of 257 mV, a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1), and a turnover frequency of 0.090 s(-1) at an overpotential of 250 mV. Comparative XPS, Infrared, and XRD studies performed on pristine and post-catalytic electrodes confirm the stability of the catalyst.

TI Structural evolution of Ce[Fe(CN)6] and derived porous
   Fe-CeO2 with high performance for supercapacitor
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Porous materials can be achieved using Metal-organic frameworks featuring various topological structures as templates. The structural evolution of Ce[Fe(CN)6] Prussian blue analogue (Ce-Fe PBA) was firstly controlled by adjusting reaction conditions at room temperature. Moreover, 3D porous Fe-CeO2 with rich oxygen vacancies were obtained by the pyrolysis of Ce-Fe PBA, which showed high performance for supercapacitor. In 1 M KOH, The as-prepared Fe-CeO2-500 electrode with the highest content of oxygen vacancies generated a high specific capacity (148 C/g at 0.5 A/g). In particular, an asymmetric supercapacitor of Fe-CeO2-500//activated carbon achieved an excellent energy storage density of 22.7 Wh/kg at a power density of 640 W/kg and excellent cycling stability with 74.5% of the capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A/g. This exciting work not only offers a method to control the structural evolution of Ce-Fe PBA with uniform size, but also develops a porous material for high-performance supercapacitors.

TI Efficient degradation of sulfacetamide by CoFe PBAs and PBA@PVDF
   composite membrane activating peroxymonosulfate
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB More and more antibiotics that are difficult to biodegrade have been detected in water environments threatening ecosystems and human health. Therefore, it is urgent to develop efficient water treatment methods to degrade antibiotics. In this work, Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with different mo-lar ratios were synthesized for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation to degrade sulfacetamide (SAM, 10 mg/L). By increasing Co molar ratio, the PMS activation capability and electrochemical properties of PBAs were enhanced. Due to its excellent reactivity (degradation efficiency of 84.2% and mineralization efficiency of 52.79%), cost benefit (electrical energy per order, 0.01019 kWh/L) and lower metal leaching ([Co] = 0.259 mg/L, [Fe] = 0.128 mg/L), PBA-1, the as-prepared catalyst with a molar ratio of cobalt to iron of 1:1, was selected for further study. The radical scavenging experiments and an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) trapping experiments were performed and revealed that PBA-1 addition was required to produced center dot OH and SO4 center dot - from PMS activation. Accordingly, we proposed a PMS activation mechanism and SAM decomposition pathways for PBA-1/PMS reaction system. Besides, a PBA-1@polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) catalytic membrane was further prepared to expand the application potential of PBA nanoparti-cles. The PBA-1@PVDF catalytic membrane was highly effective and exhibited a great reusability; thus, it could be considered for applications in actual water treatment processes.

TI A Fast Proton-Induced Pseudocapacitive Supercapacitor with High Energy
   and Power Density
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Electrochemical proton storage provides high energy, fast kinetics, safety, and environmental friendliness for grid-scale energy storage. However, the development of pseudocapacitive proton supercapacitors with fast chargeability and high stability is still challenging because of the unclear electrochemical reaction mechanism and unsuitable construction strategy. Here it is shown that a multi-metallic Prussian blue analog-Cu0.82Co0.18HCF, which possesses enhanced electronic structure and ion transport path-can intercalate/de-intercalate large amounts of proton at high rates. Ion-induced transformation of magnetism, fast solid-state proton transport, and reversible insertion/de-insertion of protons lead to extremely excellent rate capacities and cycling stability for proton storage. An asymmetric pseudocapacitive proton supercapacitor (Cu0.82Co0.18HCF//WO3 center dot nH(2)O) is fabricated with a voltage window of 1.7 V, delivering a maximum energy density of 35 Wh kg(-1) and an energy density of 22 Wh kg(-1) at a high power density of 26 kW kg(-1). Combining systematical material design and mechanism study, this work not only broadens the preparation of electrode materials but also brings light to the construction of high-performance devices for efficient proton storage.

TI Synergistic Dual-Additive Tailored Robust Interphase toward Enhanced
   Cyclability of Prussian Blue Cathode for K<SUP>+</SUP> Storage
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Fe-based Prussian blue analogs (KFeHCF) are considered as the most promising cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) owing to their low cost and high energy density. However, the unstable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) typically leads to rapid capacity decay upon long-term cycling, thus limiting its practical application. Herein, for the first time, a dual-additive strategy has been proposed as an effective and economical approach to regulate the interphase chemistry on KFeHCF surface. The optimized contents of potassium selenocyanate (KSeCN, 0.5 wt.%) and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB, 0.5 wt.%) synergistically lead to the formation of a robust, homogeneous, and conductive CEI film, which promote charge transfer and K+ diffusion, inhibit side reactions and Fe dissolution, and realize stabilization of KFeHCF structure upon long cycling. As a result, the K parallel to KFeHCF battery with 0.5 wt.% LiDFOB + 0.5 wt.% KSeCN addition exhibits significantly improved cycling performance with a high capacity retention ratio of 81.5% after 5000 cycles at 500 mA g(-1 )current density and 4.5 V cutoff voltage. This study provides a new paradigm for designing high performance potassium-ion battery via dual electrolyte additive incorporation.

TI Hydrogel Polymer-PBA Nanocomposite Thin Film-Based Bifunctional
   Catalytic Electrode for Water Splitting: The Unique Role of the Polymer
   Matrix in Enhancing the Electrocatalytic Efficiency
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB A novel approach to efficient bifunctional catalytic electrodes for water splitting is developed, based on a counter-intuitive choice of an insulating hydrogel polymer (chitosan, CS)- Prussian blue analogue (PBA, KCoFe) nanocomposite thin film on nickel foam. The polymer matrix in KCoFe-CS enables the formation of framelike structures of the non-noble metal-based catalyst nanocrystals, in addition to improving their stability. An optimized cycling protocol leads to a substantial enhancement of the electrocatalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), achieving relatively low overpotentials of 272 and 320 mV (@ 10 and 20 mA cm-2) and 146 mV (@ 10 mA cm-2), respectively, reduced Tafel slopes, and increased Faradaic efficiencies of 98 and 96%; the over-potentials estimated based on the electrochemically active surface area show similar trends. The polymer encapsulation and the cycling protocol are key to the realization of the desirable combination of enhanced efficiency and stability demonstrated up to 50 h for both OER and HER. Detailed characterizations of the postcycling catalytic electrode show that favorable morphological changes of the polymer matrix with concomitant reduction in the PBA nanocrystal size lead to the enhanced activity. The bifunctional activity of the catalytic electrode is demonstrated by the stable water splitting achieved with a 20 mA cm-2 current density at 1.55 V. The present study unravels the utility of hydrogel polymer matrices (without the use of binders like Nafion) in realizing sustainable water splitting electrocatalysts with high stability and efficiency, through the combined effect of confining the electrolyte within and favorably modifying the catalyst nanoparticles and the nanocomposite morphology.

TI Carbon Coated Bimetallic Sulfide Hollow Nanocubes as Advanced Sodium Ion
   Battery Anode
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Sodium ion battery (SIB) as a next-generation battery has been drawing much attention due to the abundance and even distribution of sodium source. Metal sulfides with high theoretical capacity and good electrical conductivity are promising anode candidates for SIB, however, the structural collapse caused by severe volume change during the de/sodiation process typically results in a fast capacity decay, limited rate capability, and cycling stability. In this work, by careful composition and structure design, polydopamine coated Prussian blue analogs derived carbon coated bimetallic sulfide hollow nanocubes (PBCS) are prepared with distinguished morphology, higher surface area, smaller charge transfer resistance, and higher sodium diffusion coefficient than the uncoated bimetallic sulfides. An optimum carbon coated bimetallic sulfide hollow nanocube anode delivers a specific capacity of approximate to 500 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) with ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1, vol%) electrolyte in the presence of fluoroethylene carbonate additives. A capacity of 122.3 mA h g(-1) can be realized at 5000 mA g(-1), showing good rate performance. In addition the carbon coated bimetallic sulfide hollow nanocubes can maintain capacity of 87 mA h g(-1) after being cycled at 500 mA g(-1) for 150 times, indicating its good cycling stability. The structure integrity, high specific capacity, good rate performance, and cycling stability of PBCS render it a promising anode material for advanced SIB.

SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) with unusual properties such as spill crossover (SCO) and metal-to-metal electron transfer (MMET) are of great interest. However, the construction of new three-dimensional (3D) PBAs is a formidable challenge. Herein, two mixed-valence 3D PBAs, {[Co-II(TPA)](3)-[Fe-III(CN)(6)][Co-III(CN)(6)]}3DMF center dot 7H(2)O (1.S) and {[Co-II(TPA)](3)[Fe-III(CN)(6)]-[Co-III(CN)(6)]}2DMF center dot 1H(2)O (2.S) (TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide), were synthesized by a solvothermal method. Complexes 1 and 2 are architectural isomers with different crystal structures, electronic absorption spectra, and magnetic properties, one of which (FS) showed reversible thermochromism accompanied by metal-to-metal electron transfer (MMET). Compound 1.S crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1/c) with a = 17.2227(8), b = 23.1538(10), c = 22.5074(12) angstrom, beta = 90.388(5)degrees, V = 8975.17(7) angstrom(3), and Z = 4. Compound 2.S crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4/nnc with a = b = 33.1374(5), c = 31.7381(10) angstrom, V = 34851.2(15) angstrom(3), and Z = 16. In both isomers, the 3D structures are constructed with heptanuclear heterometallic units, {[Co-II(TPA)](6)[Fe-III(CN)(6)])(9+), which are interconnected by [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) and [Co(CN)(6)](3-)anions in the trans mu-bridge mode. This work may provide a new perspective for the design of functional PBAs materials.

   distortions and magnetism in a series of trimetallic
   (CoxNi(1-x))4[Fe(CN)
   6]3/8 Prussian blue analogues
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The magnetic properties of a series of trimetallic (Co,Ni)Fe Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) were investigated by SQUID magnetometry and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the three transition metal (TM) K-edges. In turn, the PBA trimetallic series was used as a tool in order to better understand the information contained in TM K-edge XMCD and particularly the chemical nature of the probed species (extended sub-lattice or localized entities). The results show that the magnetic behavior of the compounds is dictated by competing exchange interactions between the Co-Fe and Ni-Fe pairs, without spin frustration. They also show that XMCD at the TM K-edge is a local atomic probe of the element at the N side of the cyanide bridge and a local probe of the absorbing atom and its first magnetic neighbors on the C side of the bridge. At last, XMCD at the TM K-edge turns out to be highly sensitive to very small structural distortions.

TI High capacity rocking-chair capacitive deionization using highly
   crystalline sodium cobalt hexacyanoferrate (NaCoHCF) electrodes
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
AB Prussian blue analogue (PBA) electrodes are widely used cation-selective electrodes for electrochemical desalination technologies due to their high specific capacity rates and fast kinetic properties. Despite the fact that previous studies of PBAs for electrochemical desalination have shown remarkable desalination capacity levels, they remain insufficient if used to desalt highly concentrated salt water such as seawater. Here, we applied highly crystalline sodium cobalt hexacyanoferrate (NaCoHCF) electrodes, a type of PBA that can utilize two redox active sites, to a rocking-chair capacitive deionization (RCDI) process. The specific capacity of the NaCoHCF electrode using two redox active sites was 88 mAh g-1 (active material: 110 mAh g-1), confirmed to be 1.5 times higher than that of PBA electrode that use one redox active site. As a result of desalination tests, this system achieved a high desalination capacity of 123 mg g-1 (active material: 154 mg g-1) with 88% ion removal in a 500 mM NaCl solution. The results of this study present a considerable increase in the desalination capacity through the introduction of NaCoHCF electrodes that utilize two redox active sites in the RCDI system.

TI Prussian blue analogues-derived zero valent iron to efficiently activate
   peroxymonosulfate for phenol degradation triggered via reactive oxygen
   species and high-valent iron-oxo complexes
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB It is of great significance to develop the effective technique to treat phenol-containing wastewater. Herein, Fe based prussian blue analogues-derived zero valent iron (ZVI) was successfully synthesized by one-step calcination method. Owing to high specific surface area and rich active sites, ZVI-2 possessed excellent performance in charge transfer. Notably, in comparison with conventional ZVI and Fe2+, ZVI-2 can effectively activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for achieving rapid degradation of phenol, and the highest removal efficiency of phenol reached 94.9% within 24 min. More importantly, developed ZVI-2/PMS oxidation system with good stability displayed strong anti-interference capability. Interestingly, Fe0 loaded on the surface of ZVI-2 can efficiently break the O-O bond of PMS to generate reactive oxygen species (i.e., SO4 & BULL;, OH & BULL;, O2 & BULL; and 1O2). As main adsorption sites of PMS, the existence of oxygen vacancy promote the formation of high-valent transition metal complexes (namely ZVI-2 & EQUIV;Fe4+=O). Under the combined action of reactive oxygen species and ZVI-2 & EQUIV;Fe4+=O, phenol can be eventually degraded into CO2 and H2O. The possible degradation pathways of phenol were also investigated. Furthermore, proposed ZVI-2/PMS oxidation system displayed great potential for application in the field of wastewater treatment. All in all, current work provided a valuable reference for design and application of Fe-based catalysts in PS-AOPs.

TI Prussian Blue Analogue-derived co/fe bimetallic nanoparticles
   immobilized on S/N-doped carbon sheet as a magnetic heterogeneous
   catalyst for activating peroxymonosulfate in water
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB While Co is the most effective metal for activating PMS, extensive efforts are made to develop Co/Fe species (CF) (e.g., CoFe2O4) for imparting magnetic properties and facilitating recovery of catalysts. When carbon substrates are doped with heteroatoms (e.g., S and N) and CF is embedded within the heteroatom-doped carbon matrix, synergies can occur to boost catalytic activities. This study proposes an alternative CF-bearing carbonaceous composite, a cobalt-containing Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA) (Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)) is employed as a precursor for preparing CF species embedded in N-doped carbon matrix and immobilized on SAN-co-doped carbon (SNC). Specifically, PBA in-situ grows on SNC by a heat treatment of trithiocyanuric acid to form PBA@SNC, which is then carbonized into CF species@SNC (CF@SNC). By adopting Amaranth degradation as a model reaction, CF@SNC shows a higher catalytic activity (k(app) = 0.230 min(-1)) than CF (k(app) = 0.152 min(-1)) and SNC (k(app) = 0.016 min(-1)) for activating PMS. In comparison with Co3O4, CF@SNC exhibits a higher catalytic activity for PMS activation. CF@SNC renders a relatively low E-a value (53 kJ/mol) for Amaranth degradation in comparison to other reported catalysts. These comparisons demonstrate the advantageous features of CF@SNC as a magnetic and efficient catalyst for PMS activation. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The ionic-liquid electrolysis cell mounted on a SQUID magnetometer was examined under DC bias voltage up to 4.0 V by injecting the charge carriers electrochemically into the PB film.

TI Synthesis of CuFe-PBA@NiFe-PBA nanocubes as a battery electrode for
   Na-ion hybrid supercapacitor
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been proposed as electrode materials for energy storage systems, offering potential advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, extended lifespan, and high energy output. However, bimetallic positive electrode materials with high capacity suffer from a significant drawback: inadequate cycle stability. In this work, a core-shell CuFe-PBA@NiFe-PBA material was designed using a straightforward coprecipitation method, wherein high-capacity CuFe-PBA are encapsulated within a reliable shell NiFe-PBA. The electrochemical performance of CuFe-PBA@NiFe-PBA has demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating Cu-ion dissolution during charging and discharging processes. CuFe-PBA@NiFe-PBA delivered a specific capacitance of 567 F/g and maintained a cycle stability of 73.0 % after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, CuFePBA@NiFe-PBA was utilized as a positive electrode in the assembly of a hybrid device, achieving an impressive energy density of 48.17 Wh/kg at a power density of 1022.5 kW/kg, while still maintaining an optimal energy density of 38.9 Wh/kg even at a high power density of approximately 10 kW/kg. and cycle stability of 93.1 % after 10,000 charge discharge cycles. The impressive performance of the hybrid device highlights its versatility and efficiency, positioning it as a compelling contender in the field of energy storage devices.

TI Solid-Solid Interfacial Charge Storage of Prussian Blue/rGO
   Mixed-Conductor Cathode for High-Power Na Ion Batteries
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB For the cathode materials potentially available for high power capability, reducing their particle size can improve the bulk ionic conductivity due to reduced ion diffusion length, and exploiting new reaction mechanisms must be fundamentally advantageous. However, other issues such as synthesis difficulty, poor charge-storage stability, and capacity decay can emerge. To simultaneously address these issues, in this work, we discover a reversible solid- solid interfacial storage in the space-charge region of ultrafine Prussian blue analogues (PBAs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO), a mixed ion/electron conductor through a so-called "job-sharing" mechanism. This mechanism shows that electrons and ions can be stored in the different phases around the interface and transport only inside there, which looks thermodynamically distinct from most conventional charge-storage mechanisms in terms of the relationship between charge storage and cell voltage. The insertion cathodes governed by the job-sharing mechanism thus exhibit outstanding performance with high capacity, fast kinetics, and stable cyclability.

TI Dimensional Transformation of Molecular Magnetic Materials
SO ACS NANO
AB Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic layered materials have revolutionized size dependent magnetism to manipulate spin-based devices. However, it has been challenging to artificially create 2D magnetic materials from three-dimensional (3D) crystal structures with a variety of material groups. Here, we present the dimensionality manipulation via cation exchange of a 3D Prussian blue analogue [RbMnFe(CN)(6)] toward a 2D magnetic sheet [(K,Rb)(V,Mn)(Cr,Fe)(CN)(6)] with the magnetic ordering temperature rising from 12 to 330 K. Such a 2D magnetic sheet achieves crystalline V-Cr coordination in the Prussian blue lattice with pronounced anisotropy and stimuli responsiveness. The pressure dependent magnetic tunability of such 2D networks is predicted using first-principles calculations and demonstrated using the phase transitions of the hydrogel. This previously unobserved phenomenon of dimensional manipulation of a bulk crystal structure provides a rational strategy to expand the diversity and chemical compositions of 2D molecular magnetic material libraries.

TI Interstitial Water Improves Structural Stability of Iron
   Hexacyanoferrate for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are considered one of the promising cathodes for sodium-ion batteries because of their low cost and tunable structure. As an intrinsic characteristic, the influence of structured water in PBAs on the electrochemical properties is still controversial. Herein, low-vacancy iron hexacyanoferrate with different interstitial water contents is synthesized through the citric acid-assisted single iron source method. Ex situ Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction characterization reveals that the interstitial water can stably exist in the Prussian blue framework during repeated cycling. The long-standing interstitial water can reduce the volume change during the Na+ insertion/extraction process, resulting in improved cycling stability. Thanks to the low Fe(CN)(6)(4+) vacancies and pillar role of interstitial water in the crystal framework, the HW-PB exhibits a high reversible capacity of 117 mAh g(-1) and excellent long cycle performance with a capacity retention of 91% after 1380 cycles. This work broadens the understanding of the relationship between the interstitial water in PBAs and Na-storage performances, providing guidance for the precise synthesis of high-quality PBAs.

TI Introducing zinc ions into manganese-based Prussian blue for improving
   the structural stability of sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Manganese-based Prussian blue (MF-N) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries and has attracted wide-spread attention owing to its advantages of high specific capacity and low cost. However, the lattice channel instability of MF-N during sodium ion de-intercalation leads to drastic phase transitions, structural damage, particle cracking, and cyclic stability failure. Considering divalent zinc ions have a strong electrostatic interaction with the crystal structure of the cathode material and present no electrochemical activity in the corresponding electrochemical window, they can effectively stabilize the lattice channel and structure of MF-N. Thus, zinc ions are introduced into the structure of MF-N to replace sodium ions on the lattice channel using a co-precipitation method. The phases of manganese-based Prussian blue with zinc ions (MF-NZ) are cubic and tetragonal when sodium ions are completely extracted due to the presence of zinc ions supporting the lattice channel, which inhibits the complete phase transformation to the tetragonal phase and makes MF-NZ exhibit excellent structural stability. The MF-NZ cathode exhibits a capacity of 104.7 mA h g-1 even at 5C and retains a capacity of 88.1 mA h g-1 in 300 cycles at 1C, which is 133.7% and 113.8% higher than those of MF-N, respectively. This study provides a feasible strategy for minimizing structural destruction and improving the electrochemical performance of the MF-N cathode.
   The introduction of non-electrochemically active metal ions stabilizes the lattice channels of manganese-based Prussian blue.

TI Surface Modification of Silicon Nanoparticles by an "Ink" Layer for

SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Owing to its high specific capacity, silicon is considered as a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, the synthesis strategies for previous silicon-based anode materials with a delicate hierarchical structure are complicated or hazardous. Here, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), widely used in ink, are deposited on the silicon nanoparticle surface (PBAs@Si-450) to modify silicon nanoparticles with transition metal atoms and a N-doped carbon layer. A facile and green synthesis procedure of PBAs@Si-450 nano-composites was carried out in a coprecipitation process, combined with a thermal treatment process at 450 degrees C. As-prepared PBAs@Si-450 delivers a reversible charge capacity of 725.02 mAh g(-1) at 0.42 A g(-1) after 200 cycles. Moreover, this PBAs@Si- 450 composite exhibits an exceptional rate performance of, similar to 1203 and 263 mAh g(-1) at current densities of 0.42 and 14 A g(-1) respectively, and fully recovered to 1136 mAh g(-1) with the current density returning to 0.42 A g(-1). Such a novel architecture of PBAs@Si-450 via a facile fabrication process represents a promising candidate with a high-performance silicon-based anode for LIBs.

SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB This paper reports a simple, direct and in situ route to prepare different graphene/copper oxide nanoparticles thin films, followed by the demonstration of their use as precursors for graphene/copper hexacyanoferrate. Starting from an aqueous dispersion of graphene oxide and aqueous solution of copper nitrate, films of graphene/Cu2O/CuO were obtained after a reaction with sodium borohydride at a water/toluene liquid/liquid interface. Different films were prepared varying the Cu2+/GO/BH4- ratio, deposited over suitable substrates and characterized by UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The films presented high transparence (94% of transmittance) and homogeneity, and they were constituted by nanoparticles of Cu2O and/or CuO, with different sizes and shapes (spheres, cubes, ellipses), homogeneously dispersed over graphene sheets. The films were further deposited over glass/ITO substrates and used as working electrodes in an electrochemical cell containing a KCl/[K3Fe(CN)(6)] aqueous solution as electrolyte, aiming the use of the copper oxide nanoparticles as precursors for the electrochemical synthesis of the Prussian blue analogue copper hexacyanoferrate. Several experimental variables were studied to find the optimal conditions for the preparation of graphene/Prussian blue analog nanocomposites, which were obtained through an original experimental procedure, as demonstrated by different characterization techniques.

Co and Mn-containing PBAs were capable of activating PMS while Cu, Fe and Ni-containing PBAs were unable to activate PMS for decolorization. As Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) (Co-Fe) and Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) (Co-Co) appeared to be the most effective PBAs for activating PMS, factors influencing RhB decolorization were further investigated to examine PMS activation by Co-Fe and Co-Co under various conditions, including changes of PBA loading, PMS dosage, temperature, pH, and salt. Both Co-Fe and Co-Co exhibited much higher catalytic activities than Co3O4 for activating PMS to decolorize RhB in water, revealing the promising catalytic activity of Co-containing PBAs. Co-Fe and Co-Co were preferably used to activate PMS at elevated temperatures and under neutral conditions. Co-Fe and Co-Co also remained highly effective for activing PMS even in the presence of concentrated NaCl. Effects of radical scavengers on decolorization suggest that RhB decolorization using PMS activated by Co-Fe and Co-Co both primarily involved sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals to a lesser extent. Recyclability of both Co-Fe and Co-Co were stable and effective for activating PMS over multiple cycles. These findings reveal that Co-containing PBAs are the most efficient PBAs for activating PMS and can be promising catalysts of PMS activation for degrading organic pollutants.

TI Hierarchically tailored hybrids via interfacial-engineering of
   self-assembled UiO-66 and prussian blue analogue: Novel strategy to
   impart epoxy high-efficient fire retardancy and smoke suppression
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB With the aim of achieving fire safe epoxy (EP), a hierarchical hybrid (UiO66-PDA-PBA) was designed with metal-organic framework (MOF, UiO-66) as the core structure, self-assembled prussian blue analogues (PBA) as surface layers, and polydopamine (PDA) as the link between the two. The tailored hierarchical structure equipped with target functions enabled the enhancement of the intrinsic fire retardancy of the inner UiO-66, through the significant interfacial catalytic effect. The results demonstrated that with the addition on of 3% UiO66-PDA-PBA, EP composites exhibited a 50% decrease in peak heat release rate (pHRR) and a 66% decrease in production of carbon monoxide (COP), accompanied with the suppression of smoke. Meanwhile, the adequate characterizations showed that the interfacial catalyst of nickel species derived from PBA exhibited high activity transforming into residue with a polyaromatic structure and exhibited catalytic oxidation effect for CO through Py-GC-MS and XRD results. The interfacial engineering between this hierarchical fire retardant and polymer may enhance quality of the char residue, which attributed to the ability for efficient catalytic effect, thus enhancing the fire safety of EP. In perspective, constructing the structure tailored hierarchical fire retardants with target functions is an effective means of achieving fire safety in epoxy.

TI Structural/Compositional-Tailoring of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Electrodes
   for Highly Efficient Capacitive Deionization
SO SMALL
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) represent a crucial class of intercalation electrode materials for electrochemical water desalination. It is shown here that structural/compositional tailoring of PBAs, the nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) electrodes in particular, can efficiently modulate their capacitive deionization (CDI) performance (e.g., desalination capacity, cyclability, selectivity, etc.). Both the desalination capacity and the cyclability of NiHCF electrodes are highly dependent on their structural/compositional features such as crystallinity, morphology, hierarchy, and coatings. It is demonstrated that the CDI cell with hierarchically structured NiHCF nanoframe (NiHCF-NF) electrode exhibits a superior desalination capacity of 121.38 mg g(-1), a high charge efficiency of up to 82%, and a large capacity retention of 88% after 40 cycles intercalation/deintercalation. In addition, it is discovered that coating of carbon (C) film over NiHCF can lower its desalination capacity owing to the partial blockage of diffusion openings by the coated C film. Moreover, the hierarchical NiHCF-NF electrode also demonstrates a superior selectivity toward monovalent sodium ions (Na+) over divalent calcium (Ca2+) and magnesim (Mg2+) ions, allowing it to be a promising platform for preferential capturing Na+ ions from brines. Overall, the structural/compositional tailoring strategies would offer a viable option for the rational design of other intercalation electrode materials applied in CDI techniques.

TI Iron and Nickel Mixed Oxides Derived From Ni<SUP>II</SUP>
   Fe<SUP>II</SUP> - PBA for Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis
SO FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB The sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on anode hinders the efficiency of electrochemical water splitting. Electrocatalysts for OER based on non-precious transition metals are highly desirable. Herein, iron and nickel mixed oxides with surface oxygen vacancies were fabricated using (NiFeII)-Fe-II-Prussian blue analog as the precursors by a facile two-step thermal-assisted method. The precursor compositions and calcination temperatures exert great impact on the structure and morphology of the derivatives, as well as the electrocatalytic performances for OER. Both the higher content of Ni ions during the synthesis of precursors and lower calcination temperature favor the electrocatalytic performance of the corresponding derivatives. The porous metal oxides consisting of nickel oxide and nickel ferrite exhibited the remarkable electrocatalytic property toward OER in an alkaline solution, which can be attributed to the nanosized and porous structure, the co-existence of spinel NiFe2O4 and cubic NiO, the high content of surface oxygen vacancies, and the low charge transfer resistance. This study will provide new inspiration for the facile design of low-cost active catalysts for OER in the future.

TI PBA composites and their derivatives in energy and environmental
   applications
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Nowadays, energy solutions and environmental remediation methods are vigorously developed to tackle the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) stand out as good performance with the three-dimensional (3D) open framework, high surface area, controllable structure, and peroxidase-like activity. Researchers are trying to break the limitation caused by the inherent defects of PBA and have explored several approaches to improve the electrochemical performance, such as suppressing the vacancy formation, combining with functional materials or substances, and constructing hollow or core-shell structures. In this review, we summarized the research progress of PBA composites and PBA derivatives for energy and environmental applications, including electrochemical energy conversion and storage, adsorption, electrochemical sensors and biosensors in view of relationship between structure, material composition, and electrochemical performance. Moreover, we have pointed out the key challenges and prospects of PBA composites and their derivatives and put forward several specific suggestions to satisfy the increasing demands for advanced applications.

TI Shape-Controlled Synthesis of Metal-Organic Frameworks with Adjustable
   Fenton-Like Catalytic Activity
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Controllable synthesis of metal-organic frameworks with well-defined morphology, composition, and size is of great importance toward understanding their structure-property relationship in various applications. Herein, we demonstrate a general strategy to modulate the relative growth rate of the secondary building units (SBUs) along different crystal facets for the synthesis of Fe-Co, Mn0.5Fe0.5-Co, and Mn-Co Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with tunable morphologies. The same growth rate of SBUs along the {100}, {110}, and {111} surfaces at 0 degrees C results in the formation of spherical PBA particles, while the lowest growth rate of SBUs along the {100} surface resulting from the highest surface energy with increasing reaction temperature induces the formation of PBA cubes. Fenton reaction was used as the model reaction to probe the structure-catalytic activity relation for the as-synthesized catalysts. The cubic Fe-Co PBA was found to exhibit the best catalytic performance with reaction rate constant 6 times higher than that of the spherical counterpart. Via density functional theory calculations, the abundant enclosed {100} facets in cubic Fe-Co PBA were identified to have the highest surface energy and favor high Fenton reaction activity.

TI Intercalation Pseudocapacitive Nanoscale Nickel Hexacyanoferrate@Carbon
   Nanotubes as a High-Rate Cathode Material for Aqueous Sodium-Ion Battery
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely investigated as cathode materials in aqueous Na-ion batteries (ASIBs) due to their special open-framework structure. Herein, nanoscale nickel hexacyanoferrate with carbon nanotubes (NiHCF@CNTs, NC for short) has been fabricated via a facile route. According to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, NiHCF is a randomly aggregated particle and CNTs are universally tangled with NiHCF. In ASIBs, NC delivers a discharge capacity of 54.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1). An astonishingly long life with a capacity retention of 80% over 10 000 cycles at 10 A g(-1) is also achieved. Significantly, this material exhibits excellent rate capability with a capacity of 47.9 mAh g(-1) even at an ultrahigh current density of 10 A g(-1). Such superior rate performance is owing to the extrinsic intercalation pseudocapacitive response. This surface-controlled mechanism suggests that developing pseudocapacitive materials is a feasible to promote the rate performance of PBAs as cathodes for ASIBs.

TI Controllable synthesis and phase-dependent electrocatalytic oxygen
   evolution performance of CoNiFe sulfide nanocubes
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) highly depends on the phase structure of catalysts. Herein, the CoNiFe-based sulfides are fabricated by a surface decoration on NiFe Prussian blue analogue, followed by an evaporating sulfurization process. The as-formed metal sulfides have a nanocubic morphology and show a phase-dependent OER activity in alkaline electrolyte. The optimized catalyst possesses a remarkable activity and durability towards OER, featured by a low overpotential of 288 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1). The outstanding OER performance originates from the hierarchically porous architecture and interfacial coupling between CoS2 and (Ni,Fe)S-2 phases. Our finding provides a promising strategy to develop advanced low-cost electrocatalysts with intriguing phase structure by producing the heterojunctions via post treatments on PBA such as surface modification and evaporation sulfidization.

SO MATERIALS
AB The CuO@CuFe2O4 core-shell structure represents a new family of photocatalysts that can be used as photoelectrodes that are able to produce hydrogen under a broad spectrum of visible light. Herein, we report a novel approach for the production of this active film by the thermal conversion of CuFe Prussian Blue Analogues. The outstanding photoelectrochemical properties of the photocathodes of CuO@CuFe2O4 were studied with the use of combinatory photo-electrochemical instrumental techniques which proved that the electrodes were stable over the whole water photolysis run under relatively positive potentials. Their outstanding performance was explained by the coupling of two charge transfer mechanisms occurring in core-shell architectures.

TI Atrazine removal by peroxymonosulfate activated with magnetic CoFe
   alloy@N-doped graphitic carbon encapsulated in chitosan carbonized
   microspheres
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Magnetic CoFe alloy@N-doped graphitic carbon (CoFe@NC) encapsulated in chitosan carbonized microspheres (CoFe@NC/CCM) was synthesized, then coupled with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for atrazine (ATZ) removal. CoFe@NC derived from Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues were embedded into CCM by the alkaline gelcarbonization process, in which CCM formed a protective layer for CoFe@NC. The morphology, crystal structure, and material composition of CoFe@NC/CCM were characterized. The effects of catalyst dosages, PMS dosages, initial pH, temperature, coexisting anions, natural organic matter (NOM), and different practical water matrices were systematically investigated. The productivity test was performed under the conditions of [PMS] = 0.4 mM, pHi = 5.9, T = 25 degrees C, ATZ = 30 mg/L and [CoFe@NC-600/CCM] = 4 mg/L, the stability upon reuse for 8 days was studied and the accumulated turnover number was determined to be 46.8 after an 8-day cycle. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technology and radical quenching tests revealed .OH and SO4.- were major radicals, with contribution rates of 49.2% and 42.9%, respectively. Fe0 -> equivalent to FeII <-> equivalent to FeIII and Co0 -> equivalent to CoII <-> equivalent to CoIII redox cycles were involved in the catalytic reaction. The toxicity effect of transformation products (TPs) on activated sludge was also evaluated. Based on quantitative structure-activity relationship model prediction, the comprehensive toxicity of ATZ and TPs was analyzed and compared by the toxicity estimation software tool. Results showed that most TPs toxicity decreased or disappeared. This work proposes an environmentally friendly and easy-to-recycle heterogeneous catalyst to remove refractory organics by activating PMS.

TI Sodium Insertion into Fe[Fe(CN)6] Framework Prepared by
   Microwave-Assisted Co-Precipitation
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are interesting materials for Na electrochemical insertion, owing to their ease of synthesis, rigid open framework and large interstitial space. In this work, iron hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles, Fe-III[Fe-III(CN)(6)], also known as Berlin green (BG), where both Fe centers are in the Fe(III) configuration, have been synthesized by an easy microwave assisted co-precipitation method, with an average particle size of around 44 nm. The BG nanoparticles exhibited a 120 mAh g(-1) specific capacity with a capacity retention of 84.8 % over 100 cycles at 20 mA g(-1) current and up to 80 mAh g(-1) at 10 C rate. The initial charge and discharge processes were fully investigated by ex-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The XAS results reveal that there is some irreversibility in the initial electrochemical processes and the Fe-C and Fe-N bond lengths change during the first charge/discharge cycle. This effect was attributed to BG electrode activation processes, and partly explained the observed capacity fading.

TI Graphene-like structure of bio-carbon with CoFe Prussian blue derivative
   composites for enhanced microwave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Traditional carbon materials such as graphene are often applied in the field of electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption but they have unbalanced impedance matching and high conductivity. Bio-carbon with graphene-like structure derived from apples has many advantages over graphene: it can be prepared in large quantities and the abundant heteroatoms present in the lattice can provide many polarization phenomena. Herein, Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a source of magnetic component was combined with bio-carbon or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to study the EMW absorption properties. The fabricated BC/CFC-12-7 displayed performance with a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of-72.57 dB and a wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 5.25 GHz with an ultra-thin and nearly equal matching thickness at 1.61 mm. The results show that the good EMW absorption property of bio-carbon composites comes from good conduction loss, large relaxation polarization loss especially from pyridinic-N, and better impedance matching. The optimized radar cross section is found to be -33.55 dB m2 in the far-field condition using CST. This work explored the advantages of bio-carbon as a novel EMW absorbing material compared with graphene and provided ideas for realizing high-performance EMW absorbing materials in the future.

TI Hollow engineering in CoNi@Air@C@MoS2 multicomponent composites derived
   from bimetallic CoNi Prussian blue analogs for ultra-wide bandwidth and
   strong electromagnetic wave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB In recent years, two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides-based multicomponent composites (MCCs) acting as electromagnetic wave (EMW) materials have received intensive investigations. However, the vulcanication of metal greatly hindered their enhancement of EMW absorption performances (EMWAPs). Herein, a combined metal-organic frameworks-derived and hydrothermal strategy was presented to produce yolk-shell structure (YSS) CoNi@Air@C@MoS2 MCCs. The results showed that the thermal and hydrothermal treatments resulted in the generation of YSS and two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheets, which maintained the original morphology of CoNi Prussian blue analogues. The protection of thick C layer well inhibited the vulcanization of inner CoNi alloy. The formed sheet-like MoS2 further optimized impedance matching characteristics, which led to the satisfactory EMWAPs of CoNi@Air@C@MoS2 MCCs. Furthermore, the EMWAPs could be further improved by optimizing the Ni:Co atom ratios CoNi@Air@C@MoS2 MCCs, which stemmed from their boosted impedance matching performances, EMW attention and polarization loss abilities. The absorption bandwidth and reflection loss values for YSS CoNi@Air@C@MoS2 MCCs are 8 GHz and -60.83 dB, which covered almost all C-Ku bands. In general, our research work provided a valid strategy to produce YSS magnetic CoNi@Air@C@MoS2 MCCs with high efficiency, which well avoided the vulcanization of metal nanoparticles, made best of hollow engineering and atomic ratio optimization strategy to boost the comprehensive EMWAPs.

TI Gd-Si Oxide Nanoparticles as Contrast Agents in Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB We describe the synthesis, characterization and application as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging of a novel type of magnetic nanoparticle based on Gd-Si oxide, which presents high Gd3+ atom density. For this purpose, we have used a Prussian Blue analogue as the sacrificial template by reacting with soluble silicate, obtaining particles with nanorod morphology and of small size (75 nm). These nanoparticles present good biocompatibility and higher longitudinal and transversal relaxivity values than commercial Gd3+ solutions, which significantly improves the sensitivity of in vivo magnetic resonance images.

TI Self-Templating Synthesis of Cobalt Hexacyanoferrate Hollow Structures
   with Superior Performance for Na-Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBA), especially with hollow structures, have attracted growing attention from the researchers of energy storage field. Herein, we have developed a facile self-templating method to synthesize hollow-structured cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) with controllable morphologies by using water-soluble precursors as templates. The method is versatile and can be extended to synthesize various PB/PBA hollow structures with tunable composition and morphology. Profiting from the unique hollow structure, the CoHCF hollow prisms manifest exceptional electrochemical performance in the Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, including a high specific capacitance (284 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), a high rate capability, and an excellent cycling stability (92% retention after 5000 cycles). A hybrid supercapacitor device assembled with the CoHCF hollow prisms and activated carbon shows a high specific density of 47 W h kg(-1) at a specific power of 1000 W kg(-1) and stable cycling performance.

TI Novel Prussian blue analogues@MXene nanocomposite as heterogeneous
   activator of peroxymonosulfate for the degradation of coumarin: The
   nonnegligible role of Lewis-acid sites on MXene
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this study, with two dimensional MXene as the substrate, Prussian blue analogues@MXene composite (PBA@MXene) was fabricated and utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidative degradation of coumarin (COU) based on peroxymonosulfate activation. The initial pH strongly affected the degradation process, and the alkaline pH was beneficial to the COU degradation than the acidic pH. The kinetic rate constants were determined to be 0.030, 0.055, 0.121 and 0.246 min(-1) at pHs of 3.0, 5.0, 6.6 and 10.0, respectively. The TOC removal efficiency achieved at pH 10.0 was 70.9% in 20 min reaction time. Radical scavengers tests showed that in the presence of 500 mM tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), the rate constant was gradually enhanced from 0.004 to 0.040 min(-1) with increasing the solution pH from 3.0 to 10.0; while with the addition of 500 mM Methanol (Me), the rate constants were determined to be 0.002, 0.001, 0.002, and 0.002 min(-1) at pHs of 3.0, 5.0, 6.6, and 10.0, respectively. Mechanism study indicated that the differences in COU degradation at different pHs could be mainly ascribed to the unsaturated Ti-C-O (Lewis-acid site) and terminal F-Ti on the catalyst surface. This work not only demonstrated that 1.2PBA@MXene was a promisingly effective catalyst for PMS activation for COU degradation, but also clearly spelled out the role of Lewis-acid sites of MXene in MXene-based catalysts.

TI Study of synergetic effects of ternary transition metal in the
   electrochemical performance of metal oxides anode for lithium-ion
   battery
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB Synergistic effect improves the electrochemical properties of metal oxide anode materials for lithium ion-batteries. The influence of different ratios of nickel and manganese on the microscopic morphology and the contribution of pseudocapacitance were investigated. The ternary Prussian blue analog NixMny[Fe(CN)(6)](2)(x + y = 3) manufactured by adjusting the ratio of Ni-Mn mixed salt was used to obtain the ternary transition metal oxide. When the ratio of Ni and Mn is 8:2 or 2:8, the synergistic effect of oxide anode materials between the ternary transition metals is strong. The corresponding materials have excellent cycle stability, higher reversible capacity, lower charge transfer resistance and higher proportion of pseudocapacitance contribution. The calcined product is NiFe2O4-FeMnO3, which has a core-shell structure when the ratio of Ni and Mn is 2:8, and the first cycle discharge capacity is 1697.6 mAh/g. It can provide a reversible capacity 536.1 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 500 mA/g. The analysis of electrode dynamics shows that the pseudocapacitance contribution can reach 46.8% at 0.1 mV/s.

TI Elucidating Gas Evolution of Prussian White Cathodes for Sodium-ion
   Battery Application: The Effect of Electrolyte and Moisture
SO BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS
AB As global energy storage demand increases, sodium-ion batteries are often considered as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Hexacyanoferrate cathodes, commonly referred to as Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), are of particular interest due their low-cost synthesis and promising electrochemical response. However, because they consist of similar to 50 wt% cyanide anions, a possible release of highly toxic cyanide gases poses a significant safety risk. Previously, we observed the evolution of (CN)(2) during cycling via differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), but were unable to determine a root cause or mechanism. In this work, we present a systematical investigation of the gas evolution of Prussian white (PW) with different water content via DEMS. While H-2 is the main gas detected, especially in hydrated PW and during overcharge (4.6 V vs. Na+/Na), the evolution of CO2 and (CN)(2) depends on the electrolyte conductive salt. The use of oxidative NaClO4 instead of NaPF6 is the leading cause for the formation of (CN)(2). Mass spectrometric evidence of trace amounts of HCN is also found, but to a much lower extent than (CN)(2), which is the dominant safety risk when using NaClO4-containing electrolyte, which despite being a good model salt, is not a viable option for commercial applications.

TI Solvent-free mechanochemical synthesis of Na-rich Prussian white
   cathodes for high-performance Na-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) with rigid open framework are promising low-cost and easily prepared cathodes for Na-ion batteries. However, their electrochemical performances are hindered from the crystal vacancies and interstitial water in a traditional aqueous co-precipitation process. Herein, we explore a solvent-free mechanochemical protocol to prepare a monoclinic Na1.94Mn[Fe0.99(CN)6]0.95.0.05.1.92H2O via regulating the crystal water in precursors. The interstitial water of NaMHCF can be further reduced through increasing the drying temperature. Ex-situ XRD confirms that the monoclinic phase transformed to the rhombohedral structure during the first cycle, and a highly reversible multi-phase evolution among rhombohedral, cubic, and Na-poor phase upon Na+ (de)intercalations occurred from the second cycle on. Finally, it delivers a specific capacity of 168.8 mA h g-1 with a stable average voltage of 3.44 V at 10 mA g-1, showing ultra-high rate capability (127 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1) and cycling stability (87.6% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1) for half cells. For the full cell of NaMHCF/NaTi2(PO4)3, it can deliver an ultra-stable cycle performance, retaining 84% capacity after 500 cycles at 100 mA g-1. Our work provides a facile avenue to prepare monoclinic NaMHCF with low water and vacancies for high-performance Na-ion batteries.

TI Oxygen-Doped Nickel Iron Phosphide Nanocube Arrays Grown on Ni Foam for
   Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis
SO SMALL
AB A rationally designed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst with advanced structural and compositional superiority is highly desirable to optimize electrocatalytic performance. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with adjustable element compositions and accessible porous structures represent a promising precursor for the preparation of OER catalysts. Herein, oxygen-doped nickel iron phosphide nanocube arrays (Ni2P/(NiFe)(2)P(O) NAs) grown on Ni foam is rationally designed and fabricated from PBAs. The porous structure and the synergistic effect of Ni and Fe enable superior electrocatalytic performance and stability toward the OER in alkaline electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Fe-incorporated Ni2P can generate new active sites on the Fe atoms, and the energy barriers of the intermediates and products are decreased efficiently in the presence of surface doped oxygen, both processes are crucial factors for enhanced catalytic performances. In 1 m KOH, the Ni2P/(NiFe)(2)P(O) NAs afford current densities of 10 and 800 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 150 and 530 mV, respectively, which outperform the commercial noble metal IrO2. Ni2P/(NiFe)(2)P(O) NAs also have long-term stability over 100 h at a high current density. The present approach may provide a new avenue for the controlled assembly of nanoarrays for energy storage and conversion applications.

TI Prussian Blue Nanoparticles as Multienzyme Mimetics and Reactive Oxygen
   Species Scavengers
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important mechanism of nanomaterial toxicity. We found that Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) can effectively scavenge ROS via multienzyme-like activity including peroxidase (POD),. catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Instead of producing hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) through the Fenton reaction, PBNPs were shown to be POD mimetics that can inhibit center dot OH generation. We theorized for the first time that the multienzyme-like activities :of PBNPs were likely caused by the abundant redox potentials of their different forms, making them efficient electron transporters. To study the ROS scavenging ability of PBNPs, a series of in vitro ROS-generating models was established using, chemicals, UV irradiation, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, high glucose contents, and,oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion. To demonstrate the ROS scavenging ability of PBNPs, an in vivo inflammation model was established using lipoproteins in Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) mite. The results indicated that PBNPs hold great potential for inhibiting or relieving injury induced by ROS in these pathological processes. electrochemistry,

   performance of nano-cube nickel cobalt-Prussian blue
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Prussian Blue Analogs (PBA) has good application potential in supercapacitors due to their unique microstructure characteristics. Nevertheless, the limited conductivity of these materials poses a significant obstacle to their widespread application as electrodes in supercapacitors. Herein, the conductivity of NiCo-PBA is enhanced through the implementation of three surface treatment methods, namely sulfidizing, selenizing and phosphating, and then the explicit electrochemical performance of NiCo-PBA was elevated. In addition, the P-NiCo-PBA//AC ASC occupies the best energy density (48.90 Wh kg-- 1 / 4 2.16 Wh kg- 1 ) at a certain power density (1947.38 W kg-- 1 / 9 545.10 W kg- 1 ) compared to the NiCo-PBA//AC ASC, S-NiCo-PBA//AC ASC and Se-NiCo-PBA//AC ASC, and the specific capacitance retention rate of P-NiCo-PBA//AC ASC after 10,000 cycles is 88.25%. The phosphating strategy outperforms sulfidizing and selenizing strategies in enhancing the performance of nanocube-like NiCo-PBA supercapacitors. The accomplishment significantly broadens the potential applications of PBA-based materials as electrodes for supercapacitors.

TI Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Bimetallic NiFe Selenide
   Electrocatalysts with Multiple Phases for Efficient Oxygen Evolution
   Reaction
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB The development of efficient and stable transition bimetallic chalcogenides to replace precious metal electrocatalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains an ongoing challenge. Here, a bimetallic NiFe selenide catalyst synthesized by facile selenization of NiFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticle precursors is reported for efficient OER in alkaline solutions. Through two-step electrodeposition and post-thermal pyrolytic selenization, mixed NiFe selenide supported by carbon fiber paper (NiFe-Se/CFP) can be facilely prepared. A low overpotential of 281 mV is required by the NiFe-Se/CFP electrode to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2); additionally, an accelerated electron-transfer kinetics is obtained with a Tafel slope of 40.93 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. The electrocatalytic current density shows negligible loss during 20 h continuous electrolysis, suggesting good stability during long-term alkaline OER. Using the MOF precursor and establishing an in situ phase transformation endow mixed NiFe selenide with highly active surface catalytic sites and high electrical conductivity for efficient water oxidation.

TI Cobalt incorporated MoS2 hollow structure with rich
   out-of-plane edges for efficient hydrogen production
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Recently, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have received intensive research interest as an important family of functional materials. In particular, MOFs were widely used in electroanalysis and water splitting for their electrical conductivity and rich redox electrochemical activities. Prussian blue analogue (PBA), which owns hollow nanostructured MOFs with large surface area and unique structural features, offers great advantages for constructing advanced electrodes. Meanwhile, compared with platinum-based catalysts, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is increasingly becoming a research focus as an affordable alternative obtaining electrochemical hydrogen production from water. Here we synthesized the nano materials, MoS2-Co nanoboxes, using the facile hydrothermal method between cobalt Prussian blue analogue (Co PBA) nanocubes and ammonium thiomolybdate ((NH4)(2)MoS4). In acid and alkaline media, the MoS2-Co nanoboxes exhibit favorable catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, for researching the relationship of structural changes of MoS2 supported on Co PBA nanocubes and HER catalytic performance, we use the Raman spectroscopy to monitor nanostructured MoS2 which can promote the exposure of the most active sites. This new method applied in this study can be widely adopted for characterization of transition metal dichalcogenides with various compositions for a wide range of applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI A Long-Life Aqueous Rechargeable Aluminum-Ammonium Hybrid Battery
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs) offer a low-cost, high-safety, and fast-reacting alternatives for large-scale energy storage. However, their further practical applications are limited by challenges in achieving satisfactory energy density, long cycling lifetime, and cost-effectiveness. In this study, an aqueous rechargeable aluminum-ammonium hybrid battery is reported (AAHB) that utilizes a Prussian blue analogue (K1.14FeIII[FeII(CN)6]<middle dot>nH2O) as an ultra-stable cathode for reversibly accommodating ammonium ion, paired with aluminum- one of the lowest-cost metals, aside from iron-as the anode. An average working voltage of 1.15 V, remarkable rate capability, and an attractive energy density of 89.3 Wh kg-1 are achieved. Notably, the Prussian blue analogue cathode exhibits almost no attenuation after an ultra-long cycle life of 100,000 cycles, and the assembled AAHB demonstrates a long cycling lifespan exceeding 10,000 cycles.

TI Copper hexacyanoferrate cathode as a selective adsorbent for ammonium
   ions in sodium-rich solutions
SO CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Ammonium ion remediation has led to innovative methods, such as Faradaic redox reaction using Prussian blue. Our approach uses an adsorption reaction that is controlled by electric current instead of potential. By sweeping the potential through current control, selective adsorption of NH4+ was achieved in solutions with high concentrations of Na+ (ca. 1:50). The use of thick electrodes enabled ammonium levels to be reduced to environmentally acceptable levels in 3 steps, even from highly concentrated solutions of NH4+ (200 mmol/L).

TI Preparation of a three-dimensional bimetallic CoFex/ N-doped carbon
   nanomaterial used as modified electrode for the efficient
   electrochemical detection of L-tyrosine
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB The rapid and sensitive detection of L-tyrosine (L -Tyr) has become a vital issue in the fields of medicine and clinical analysis as lack or overdose of L -Tyr in human body could cause disease. In this paper, a threedimensional cubic CoFex/N-doped carbon nanocomposite (CoFex-N,C) material was prepared by hightemperature calcination of CoFe-Prussian blue analogues (CoFe-PBA) in N2 atmosphere and then modified on glass carbon electrode (GCE) for L -Tyr detection. The prepared CoFex/N,C nanocomposite not only inherits the uniform morphology, and unique bimetallic active center of CoFe-PBA, but also possesses the high conductivity and large ratio area of nitrogen -doped carbon nanomaterials. Under optimum conditions, the CoFex/N,C nanocomposite electrode presented a broad linear scope of 0.8-354.84 mu M, a low detection limit of 0.06 mu M (S/N = 3), good anti-interference ability, and very high stability. In addition, the acceptable recoveries were obtained for real sample analysis.

TI Interfacial Scaffolding Preparation of Hierarchical PBA-Based Derivative
   Electrocatalysts for Efficient Water Splitting
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The development of highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts is crucial for overall water splitting. Herein, the in situ scaffolding formation of 3D Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on a variety of 2D or 1D metal hydroxides/oxides to fabricate hierarchical nanostructures is first demonstrated. Typically, cobalt hydroxide or oxide nanoarrays are used as the precursor and structural oriented template for the subsequent growth of 3D PBA nanocubes. The mechanism study reveals that the interfacial scaffolding process can be reversibly controlled via the in situ ion exchange process with adjusting coordination ions. Thus, the facile, versatile strategy can extend to successfully fabricate a variety of hierarchical PBA-based nanostructures including on cobalt fluoride hydroxide, copper hydroxide, monometal or bimetal nickel-cobalt hydroxides, cobalt oxide, and manganese oxide nanosheets with structural tailor-ability and chemical diversity. More interestingly, the metal nitride derivatives obtained via controlled calcination process exhibit good electrocatalytic activity for water splitting with low overpotentials, and remarkable durability for 1200 h, thanks to the superior intrinsic activity of bimetal nature and the scrupulous hierarchical structure. This versatile strategy provides a paradigm for rational design of PBA-based functional nanomaterials, which is highly promising in energy conversion, storage, and electrocatalytic fields.

TI Single Open Sites on Fe<SUP>II</SUP> Ions Stabilized by Coupled Metal
   Ions in CN-Deficient Prussian Blue Analogues for High Catalytic Activity
   in the Hydrolysis of Organophosphates
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB CN-deficient Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), [M-N(H2O)(x)](y)[Fe-II(CN)(5)(NH3)] (M-N = Cu-II, Co-II, or Ga-III), were synthesized and examined as a new class of heterogeneous catalysts for hydrolytic decomposition of organophosphates often used as pesticides. The active species of the CN-deficient PBAs were mainly C-bound Fe-II ions with only single open sites generated by liberation of the NH3 ligand during the catalytic reactions. [Cu-II(H2O)(8/3)](3/2)[Fe-II(CN)(5)(NH3)] showed higher catalytic activity than [Co-II(H2O)(8/3)](3/2)[Fe-II(CN)(5)(NH3)] and [Ga-III(H2O)][Fe-II(CN)(5)(NH3)], although N-bound Cu-II species has been reported as less active than Co-II and Ga-III species in conventional PBAs. IR measurements of a series of the CN-deficient PBAs after the catalytic reactions clarified that a part of the NH3 ligands remained on [CoII(H2O)(8/3)](3/2)[Fe-II(CN)(5)(NH3)] and that hydrogen phosphate formed as a product strongly adsorbed on the Fe-II ions of [Ga-III(H2O)][Fe-II(CN)(5)(NH3)]. Hydrogen phosphate also adsorbed, but weakly, on the Fe-II ions of [Cu-II(H2O)(8/3)](3/2)[Fe-II(CN)(5)(NH3)]. These results suggest that heterogeneous catalysis of the Fe-II ions with single open sites were tuned by the MN ions through metal-metal interaction.

TI Morphology-controlled synthesis of La[Fe(CN)6] and the porous
   erythrocyte-like derivant applied for high-performance supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The porous electrodes derived from Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) show high specific capacity and superior energy densities in supercapacitors due to their tunable chemical compositions, open three-dimensional network framework and large surface area. In this work, La-Fe PBA with different morphologies is prepared at mild conditions via controlling the composition of mixed solvent and the structural evolution of the La-Fe PBA is further explored. The solubility of K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] and the influence of ethanol on the crystal growth is used to control the synthesis of La-Fe PBA. Four different morphologies of La-Fe PBA, such as chamfered hexagonal bipyramid microcrystals, hexagonal flakes, erythrocyte-like microstructure and small flakes, are successfully synthesized by changing the ethanol/water ratio of mixed solvent. The porous LaFeO3 with the same shape is obtained by calcining the La-Fe PBA at 500 ?, which is subsequently employed as electrodes for battery-type supercapacitor. The erythrocyte-like LaFeO3 shows remarkable specific capacity (330 C g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1), energy density (23.8 Wh kg(-1)) and power density (400 W kg(-1)) at 1 A g(-1). This work could provide a porous material for high-performance supercapacitors as well as an exciting strategy to develop and design materials with specific morphology.

TI Low-defect potassium vanadyl hexacyanoferrate cathode material with high
   specific capacity for aqueous zinc ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are considered to be one of the most promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the low specific capacity due to defects and low activity has become the major problem limiting their application. In this work, a potassium vanadyl hexacyanoferrate K0.37VO[Fe (CN)6]0.61 center dot 2.6H2O was synthesized by ethanol-assisted co-precipitation. Controlled growth by ethanol addition results in smaller particle size and fewer defects in K0.37VO[Fe(CN)6]0.61 center dot 2.6H2O, leading to excellent zinc ion storage properties. The K0.37VO[Fe(CN)6]0.61 center dot 2.6H2O cathode material exhibits a high specific capacity of 190 mAh center dot g-1 at 0.1 A center dot g-1 and an outstanding rate performance of 160 mAh center dot g-1 at 2 A center dot g-1. Ex-situ characterization technologies reveal that the zinc-ion storage process is involve with redox reaction of Fe2+/Fe3+ and V3+/V4+/ V5+, as well as phase transition.

TI A Novel Synthetic Route for the Preparation of an Amorphous Co/Fe
   Prussian Blue Coordination Compound with High Electrocatalytic Water
   Oxidation Activity
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Co/Fe Prussian Blue coordination networks have recently been investigated for heterogeneous water oxidation catalysis. Despite their robustness and stability in both acidic and neutral media, the relatively low current density obtained is their main drawback as a result of their low surface concentration. A novel synthetic approach was employed using a pentacyanometalate-based metallopolymer for the preparation of amorphous Co/Fe coordination polymers to overcome this problem. The surface concentration was improved approximately 7-fold, which also resulted in an increase in the catalytic activity. A current density of 1 mA center dot cm-2 was obtained only at eta = 510 mV, while the same current density could be obtained at higher overpotentials (>600 mV) with conventional Prussian Blue analogues. IR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies were performed to investigate the stability of electrodes before and after the electrocatalytic process. The results of this study indicate that the rich and diverse chemistry of pentacyanometalates makes them potential candidates for application in heterogeneous water oxidation catalysis.

TI Large optical third-order nonlinearities in a switchable Prussian blue
   analogue
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB We report on the observation of an efficient coherent up-conversion via third harmonic generation (THG) in Rb0.94Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.98).0.3H(2)O material. Our THG measurements at fundamental wavelengths ranging from 1200 to 2400 nm show that, in this spectral range, the THG signal overcomes the signal generated by frequency doubling. This demonstrates that this material possesses significant third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) responses. Its effective chi((3)) value is at least two orders of magnitude greater than alpha-Quartz. We also demonstrate that this material exhibits a broad thermal hysteresis loop around room temperature, which makes it possible to simultaneously photo-commute its linear and third order nonlinear optical properties.

TI Dual redox-active copper hexacyanoferrate nanosheets as cathode
   materials for advanced sodium-ion batteries
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Prussian Blue Analogs (PBAs) such as copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) are traditional intercalation cathodes for rechargeable Na-ion batteries. However, the electrochemical performance of these PBAs suffers from insufficient activation and sharp performance deterioration. Here, the insufficient electrochemical activity and frame deformation issues in the CuHCF cathodes were investigated to enhance their specific capacity and improve their cycling stability. The high-crystallinity CuHCF nanosheets (CuHCF-P) with low-water-content were synthesized by a pyrophosphate-assistant co-precipitation method. It has a highly reversible 1.5-Na insertion/desertion capability with a specific capacity of similar to 120 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, which is the highest among all the CuHCF cathodes reported. First-principle study and XPS detection demonstrate that both Cu and Fe are redox-active centers in CuHCF-P cathode, which facilitates a high Na+ storage capability. And the decrease of water content in CuHCF framework increases Fe/Cu 3d-orbital occupy-sites, which activates both of the transition-metals. Furthermore, the full cells fabricated with as-prepared CuHCF-P cathode and commercial hard carbon anode exhibit excellent performances with a reversible capacity of 109 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C over 200 cycles.

TI Unexpected Chain of Redox Events in Co-Based Prussian Blue Analogues
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB The electronic structure of electrode materials for metal-ion batteries has a great impact on their charge compensation mechanism and, consequently, electrochemical behavior. In this paper, we report on the cobalt doping in the potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate positive electrode material for potassium-ion batteries, resulting in the formation of a system of K2-delta CoxMn1-x[Fe(CN)6] compounds with x = 0...1 and provide their comprehensive characterization including crystal structure evolution and charge compensation mechanisms upon K de/intercalation. Synthesized by a coprecipitation method, K2-delta CoxMn1-x[Fe(CN)6] forms two series of solid solutions with monoclinic (Co-poor) and cubic (Co-rich) structures. According to energy dispersive X-ray analysis, the K content diminishes with increasing x value. Electrochemical properties of electrode materials based on K2-delta CoxMn1-x[Fe(CN)6] in K-metal half cells are also strongly dependent on Co doping regarding both specific capacity and redox potential. Attempts to interpret the results led to an unexpected conclusion that cobalt has influence on iron and manganese redox potentials, forming the following oxidation sequence: Co2+/3+, Mn2+/3+, and Fe2+/3+ in K2-delta CoxMn1-x[Fe(CN)6], which is inverse to that of Co-free K2-delta Mn[Fe(CN)6] (Fe2+/3+, Mn2+/3+), as validated by ex situ, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and 57Fe Mo''ssbauer spectroscopy.

TI Bimetallic MOF-derived CoFe@nitrogen-doped carbon composites for wide
   bandwidth and excellent microwave absorption
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Magnetic carbon-based composites derived from metal-organic frameworks have been regarded as potential microwave absorption (MA) materials. Here, we successfully fabricate magnetic CoFe alloy@nitrogen-doped carbon shell (CoFe@NC) composites with strong absorption, thin thickness, and wide bandwidth through the thermal decomposition of CoFe Prussian blue analogues. Annealing temperature has a remarkable influence on dielectric and magnetic behavior of composites, thereby improving the impedance matching and MA ability. When the annealing temperature of CoFe@NC composites is 600 celcius, the CoFe@NC composites show the best MA performance with the reflection loss (RL) value of - 50.77 dB and the maximum effective absorbing bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) of 7.2 GHz (2.1 mm). The CoFe@NC composites possess superior MA properties because of the high dielectric loss deriving from nitrogen-doped carbon as the shell, high magnetic loss originating from CoFe alloy as the core and conduction loss. The superior MA performance of CoFe alloy@NC composites make them ideal candidates for high-efficient MA applications. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI PBA@PPy derived N-doped mesoporous carbon nanocages embedded with FeCo
   alloy nanoparticles for enhanced performance of oxygen reduction
   reaction
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Due to the obstacle of sluggish kinetics on cathode of fuel cells and metal-air batteries, developing low-cost and durable electrocatalysts to replace the platinum-based catalysts still remains a grand challenge. Here, we describe a simple self-template approach to synthesize N-doped mesoporous carbon nanocages (FeCo@NC) embedded with FeCo alloy nanoparticles as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. The resulting heterostructure is derived from corresponding PBA@PPy composites, which are preprepared by polymerization of polypyrrole (PPy) layer on Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes. The FeCo alloy nanoparticles with an average particle size of similar to 10 nm are well dispersed and confined within the shell of carbon nanocages. Benefiting from the mesoporous structure and the synergetic interaction of binary metals, the optimized FeCo@NC-3-800 electrocatalyst exhibits comparable ORR performances (0.83 V for half-wave potential (E-1/2), 5.323 mA cm(-2) for limiting current density (J(k))), superior durability and excellent methanol tolerance to the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). This work provides an appropriate strategy for general, efficient and practical synthesis of more promising non-precious metal electrocatalyst with high ORR activity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI Formation of Ni-Fe Mixed Diselenide Nanocages as a Superior Oxygen
   Evolution Electrocatalyst
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Exploring effective electrocatalysts is a crucial requirement for boosting the efficiency of water splitting to obtain clean fuels. Here, a self-templating strategy is reported to synthesize Ni-Fe mixed diselenide cubic nanocages for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The diselenide nanocages are derived from corresponding Prussian-blue analog nanocages, which are first obtained by treating the nanocube precursor with a site-selective ammonia etchant. The resulting Ni-Fe mixed diselenide nanocages perform as a superior OER electrocatalyst, which affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 240 mV; a high current density, mass activity, and turnover frequency of 100 mA cm(-2), 1000 A g(-1), and 0.58 s(-1), respectively, at the overpotential of 270 mV; a Tafel slope as small as 24 mV dec(-1); and excellent stability in alkaline medium.

TI Structural, photoluminescent and electrochemical properties of
   self-assembled Co3[Co(CN)6]2/ZnO nanocomposite
SO INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Advanced functional nanocomposites designed for multiple applications can be developed using supramolecular chemistry. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of nanosized composite material (Co3[Co (CN)6]2/ZnO) formed by cobalt Prussian blue analogue (Co3[Co(CN)6]2) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs). Structural, morphological and optical characterization, supramolecular arrangement, and electrochemical properties of the materials were investigated. Based on TEM results, Co3[Co(CN)6]2/ZnO predominantly pre-sented a size-polydisperse cube-shaped morphology. A decrease of the nanocomposite mean particle diameter relative to Co3[Co(CN)6]2 was observed. Similar behavior was confirmed by dynamic light scattering with decrease of hydrodynamic diameter value after nanocomposite formation. The Co3[Co(CN)6]2 and Co3[Co (CN)6]2/ZnO exhibited potential zeta values at-69.5 and-59.6 mV respectively suggesting superficial negative character and excellent colloidal stability, even after ZnO NPs incorporation. The electronic spectral of UV-Vis region exhibited semiconductor properties of the nanocomposite despite the presence of the cobalt complex. Interesting that Co3[Co(CN)6]2/ZnO showed a voltammetric profile with two redox pair with E1/2 values of 0.46 and 0.54 V attributed to the Co+/Co2+ and Co2+/Co3+, respectively, and an irreversible reduction process at-0.74 V attributed to Zn2+/Zn0 species, which differ from the electrochemical processes observed for individual componentes, Co3[Co(CN)6]2 (E1/2 = 0.40 V) and ZnO species (Epc =-0.74 V). The electron transport study of the nanocomposite indicated that the both electrochemical redox processes were controlled by diffusion and adsorption.

TI Electrodeposited Na2VOX[Fe(CN)6]
   films As a Cathode Material for Aqueous Na-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The so-called Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are spotlighted as promising cathode materials for aqueous Na-ion batteries regarding their good performance for the application in future large-scale energy storage systems. In this work, we demonstrate that one of the PBA representatives, namely Na2VOx[Fe(CN)(6)] thin films (VHCFs), is a promising cathode material for aqueous Na-ion batteries with very positive intercalation/deintercalation potentials, which might likely designate a new benchmark in the field. To maximize the material utilization, we have formed VHCF thin films on model current collectors from aqueous solutions. The resulting films demonstrated a very positive half-charge potential (Delta E-I/2 approximate to 0.91 V vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode) in acidic media with a specific capacity of similar to 80 mAh g(-1) recorded at high C-rates (30 C) in 1 M LiNO3, 3 M NaNO3 and 3 M KNO3 electrolytes in the presence of 3.6 M H2SO4. It is also shown that well-known solvation effects related to the nature of the alkali metal cations during intercalation and deintercalation are surprisingly not pronounced in the case of VHCFs.

TI Tuning the electronic structure and hydrophilicity of Prussian-blue type
   catalysts by incorporation of alklypyrazinium bromides, for enhanced
   activity
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB Prussian blue (PB) type material, a historical metal coordination material, is widely used in batteries, catalyst, and for energy storage. However, the scarcity of active sites and its immutable structure limit further applica-tions. Herein, we propose a ligand substitution strategy to tune the electronic structure and hydrophilicity of the PB-type material, involving Fe(CN)5 as a cyanide precursor, to catalyze epoxidation of olefins. The catalytic performance can be significantly promoted for styrene oxide in the presence of a CoFe PB analog that includes decylpyrazinium bromide (named CoFe-10). Kinetic studies on styrene epoxidation with CoFe-10 show a low activation energy of 27.2 kJ/mol. In addition, mechanistic investigation, coupled to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements, suggests that the CoOOC(CH3)3 adduct is the reactive species for epoxidation of styrene. This study provides an effective strategy to synthesize unprecedented PB-type material and extend its application.

   Prussian blue analogue derivative
   SrCoO3/Co3O4 nanospheres and carbon
   quantum dots for the colorimetric detection of tigecycline in river
   water
SO TALANTA
AB In this work, for the first time, we derived a composite of perovskite oxide SrCoO3 and Co3O4 by annealing the Prussian blue analogue exchanged with strontium ions and modified with carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Its peroxidase-like catalytic activity was explored. The peroxidase-like activity was mainly evaluated by the rate of the chromogenic reaction. When H2O2 was present in the reaction system, the colorless substrate 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was oxidized into a blue product (oxTMB), and this was monitored by UV-vis absorption spectrum. Among them, the SrCoO3 and CQDs not only promoted the generation of superoxide anion radicals (O2- center dot) and electron-hole pairs (h+) in the reaction system, but also accelerated the electron transfer between the substrate TMB and H2O2. Therefore, the peroxidase-like catalytic activity of the reaction system was significantly improved. Moreover, the complexation of tigecycline (TGC) and CQDs@SrCoO3/Co3O4 composite enhanced the peroxidase-like catalytic activity of the reaction system. Based on this, using TGC and TMB as template molecules, a molecularly imprinted colorimetric sensor for detecting TGC was constructed. The absorbance difference of the reaction system was linear with the TGC concentration in the range of 0.02-6.0 mu M, and the detection limit was 4.46 nM. Furthermore, the proposed sensor had high selectivity and applied to the detection of TGC in Pearl River water.

TI Copper hexacyanoferrate nanocrystal as a highly efficient non-noble
   metal catalyst for reduction of 4-nitrophenol in water
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB As Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) represent one of the most classical families of coordination compounds and exhibit versatile catalytic activities, PBAs have been considered as useful heterogeneous catalysts for reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP). Nevertheless, while Cu has been a well-proven transition metal for 4-NP reduction, especially, due to their ability to attain pronounced conversions of reactants under mild conditions, environmental friendliness and great stability. Nevertheless, while Cu has been a well-proven transition metal for 4-NP reduction, Cu-based PBA has never been developed and thoroughly investigated for 4-NP reduction. Thus, in this study, copper hexacyanoferrate, Cu-3(II)[Fe(CN)(6)](2) (CuFeCN) is particularly synthesized and proposed for the first time as a catalyst for reduction of 4-NP in the presence of NaBH4. CuFeCN exhibits a very high catalytic activity towards reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP with 100% conversion within 4 min. The activity factor (AF) at room temperature, 8057.14 s (1) g (1), is between 1 and 2 orders higher than all other MFeCN Prussian blue analogues (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Mn). In addition, CuFeCN shows excellent reusability to achieve 100% conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP with highly stable rate constants over successive 7 cycles. The activation energy (E-a) and turn over frequency (TOF) for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP catalyzed by CuFeCN system are determined as 24.6 kJ mol (1) and 36.93 min (1), respectively, which are both significantly more superior than most of reported catalysts in literatures. These advantageous properties make CuFeCN ideal to be developed into a promising catalyst for elimination of nitroaromatic contaminants in water. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Designing CoHCF@FeHCF Core-Shell Structures to Enhance the Rate
   Performance and Cycling Stability of Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Prussian blue analogs are well suited for sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to their cheap cost and high theoretical specific capacity. NaxCoFe(CN)(6) (CoHCF), one of the PBAs, has poor rate performance and cycling stability, while NaxFeFe(CN)(6) (FeHCF) has better rate and cycling performance. The CoHCF@FeHCF core-shell structure is designed with CoHCF as the core material and FeHCF as the shell material to enhance the electrochemical properties. The successfully prepared core-shell structure leads to a significant improvement in the rate performance and cycling stability of the composite compared to the unmodified CoHCF. The composite sample of core-shell structure has a specific capacity of 54.8 mAh g(-1) at high magnification of 20 C (1 C = 170 mA g(-1)). In terms of cycle stability, it has a capacity retention rate of 84.1% for 100 cycles at 1 C, and a capacity retention rate of 82.7% for 200 cycles at 5 C. Kinetic analysis shows that the composite sample with the core-shell structure has fast kinetic characteristics, and the surface capacitance occupation ratio and sodium-ion diffusion coefficient are higher than those of the unmodified CoHCF.

TI Bimetallic CoZn Nanocrystals Embedded in N-Doped Graphene Layers as
   Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
AB In this work, highly active CoZn nanocrystals embedded in N-doped graphene layers (CoZn@NG-nPVP) towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were synthesized through pyrolysis of bimetallic zinc cobalt Prussian blue analogues (i.e., Zn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)-nPVP), which consists of coordination band between zinc and [Co(CN)(6)](3-), with PVP as a structure regulator. The obtained CoZn@NG-nPVP samples display three-dimensional porous microsphere structures. Compared with CoZn@NG samples derived from Zn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) without PVP, the CoZn@NG-nPVP samples derived from Zn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)-nPVP with PVP exhibit more carbon defects, larger BET specific surface area, and higher contents of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, leading to the high activity of the catalyst. The onset potential of CoZn@NG-4PVP-900 catalyst towards ORR is 0.98 V (vs. RHE) and the half-wave potential is 0.87 V (vs. RHE), which are comparable with that of commercial Pt/C. In addition, the electrochemical stability of CoZn@NG-4PVP-900 is much higher than that of commercial Pt/C.

TI Influence of the Presence of Different Alkali Cations and the Amount of
   Fe(CN)6 Vacancies on CO2 Adsorption on Copper
   Hexacyanoferrates
SO MATERIALS
AB The CO2 adsorption on various Prussian blue analogue hexacyanoferrates was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis. Compositions of prepared phases were verified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, infra-red spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. The influence of different alkali cations in the cubic Fm3m structures was investigated for nominal compositions A(2/3)Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](2/3) with A = vacant, Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs. The Rb and Cs compounds show the highest CO2 adsorption per unit cell, similar to 3.3 molecules of CO2 at 20 degrees C and 1 bar, while in terms of mmol/g the Na compound exhibits the highest adsorption capability, similar to 3.8 mmol/g at 20 degrees C and 1 bar. The fastest adsorption/desorption is exhibited by the A-cation free compound and the Li compound. The influence of the amount of Fe(CN)(6) vacancies were assessed by determining the CO2 adsorption capabilities of Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](1/2) (Fm3m symmetry, nominally 50% vacancies), KCu[Fe(CN)(6)](3/4) (Fm3m symmetry, nominally 25% vacancies), and CsCu[Fe(CN)(6)] (I-4m2 symmetry, nominally 0% vacancies). Higher adsorption was, as expected, shown on compounds with higher vacancy concentrations.

TI Redox-coupled alkali-metal ion transport mechanism in binder-free films
   of Prussian blue nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue (PB), an archetypal classic porous coordination polymer, has been rediscovered as a potential electrode material for ion secondary batteries due to its accommodations for alkali-metal ions. Many researchers have investigated the charge/discharge capacities of PB and its analogue (PBA) cells with binders. Binders, however, often obscure the underlying redox-coupled ion transport mechanism and the intrinsic transport pathways in PB and PBAs. Using binder-free PB film electrodes prepared by our low-temperature annealing method, we monitored the redox process accompanied by ion transport through simultaneous electrochemical and electrochromic measurements. We clarify that large pores of the defect lattice PB facilitate the efficient transport of bare and solvated Li+/K+, whereas small pores of the perfect lattice PB only allow bare Li+ to be transported up to inner lattice layers. This highlights the importance of pore/ion size selectivity and the (de)solvation effect. Quantum chemical calculations of a perfect lattice model revealed the size-dependent transport pathways of bare Li+ and K+, which microscopically corroborate the experimentally observed selectivity. In addition, spin density difference maps demonstrate that the Li+ transport can be facilitated not only by the electrochemical reduction of all Fe-III centres but also by Li+-induced local redox reactions of the lattice framework. Our combined experimental and theoretical studies provide a fundamental understanding of the concealed structure-property relationship in PB films, thereby contributing to a more systematic design of high-performance PB/PBA electrodes.

TI Investigation of the effect of surface modification with organosilane on
   the multi-redox electrochemical behavior of
   Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes
SO ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB The search for new functional nanomaterials rounds science for decades and supramolecular chemistry is an approach used to properly achieve this goal. The present work reports the successful synthesis of Co3[Co (CN)6]2@SiO2-NH2 nanomaterial, formed from the supramolecular association of cobalt Prussian blue analogue, Co3[Co(CN)6]2, and an external amorphous layer (@SiO2-NH2) originated from the addition of organosilanes as tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS). The amount of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (0.22, 0.33, 0.44, 0.55, and 0.67 nmol) used to prepare SiO2 layer was varied to assess its impact on the properties of the new synthesized nanomaterial, which were named Co3[Co(CN)6]2@SiO2-NH2-01 to Co3[Co(CN)6]2@SiO2-NH2-05. XRD analyses were consistent with the pattern for Co3[Co(CN)6]2. FTIR measurements confirmed the modification of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes surface by the formation of SiO2, and the attachment of NH2 groups after the APTMS addition was confirmed by the ninhydrin test, since the UV-Vis analysis showed a band around 576 nm, typical of a Ruherman's purple. TEM images showed Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes with averaging size around 110 nm, and an amorphous SiO2 layer around 15 nm thick after modification by TEOS and APTMS. Cyclic voltammetry analyses of Co3[Co(CN)6]2@SiO2-NH2 nanomaterials showed the appearance of second redox process in lower scan rates (10-50 mV s-1), as the surface of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 is modified by TEOS and APTMS. Beyond that, electron transfer processes were evident even with the dielectric coating of SiO2 at high scan rates, which makes it suitable for application as an electrochemical biosensor as NH2modified-SiO2 is capable of being functionalized with a wide range of molecules.

TI Copper hexacyanoferrate as ultra-high rate host for aqueous ammonium ion
   storage
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Rechargeable aqueous batteries have aroused increasing attention as an effective energy strategy. In this research, non-metallic ammonium ions are reported as a highly efficient charge carrier to reversible insert into NH4+-rich copper hexacyanoferrate (N-CuHCF) in aqueous NH4NO3 electrolyte. It is worth noting that N-CuHCF displays remarkable rate performance with no obvious capacity loss (60.0 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, 59.0 mAh g(-1) at 50 C) and negligible voltage polarization (similar to 0.1 V) from 1 to 50 C. Even at ultra-high rate (>= 100 C), N-CuHCF still demonstrates favorable long-life cycling performance. For example, capacity retentions of 91.5% and 86.5% are achieved over 17,000 and 20,000 cycles at 100 and 180 C, respectively. Furthermore, XRD, FTIR, and XPS reveal the essence of reversible redox reaction and stable structure of N-CuHCF based on Fe3+/Fe2+ and Cu2+/Cu+ couples. Hence, the rechargeable aqueous batteries based on the infinite ammonium ion and the stable Prussian blue analogues provide a novel imagine for large-scale and fast energy applications.

TI Zinc Hexacyanoferrate/Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Films for
   Rechargeable Aqueous Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) is a Prussian Blue analog and can be intercalated by both monovalent and divalent ions. ZnHCF/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) film could be used as a cathode for zinc ions battery. Carbon nanotubes improved significantly the electrochemical performance of the electrode. It is described the preparation of ZnHCF/MWCNT films by the interfacial method with cyclohexane/water mixture as solvent. The crystal structure, morphology, and microstructure of the as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy. Mossbauer, Raman spectroscopy. and infrared spectroscopy. Results revealed that the MWCNTs extend the electrochemical properties of the ZnHCF and influence the structure and morphology of the hexacyanoferrate particles. If tested as cathode material for zinc ion batteries, the nanocomposite film exhibits a capacity of 25.81 mA h g(-1), which is much higher than those obtained for a ZnHCF single-component film (3.28 mA h g(-1)). The physical characteristics and properties that allow good reversibility to a high potential difference, achieved with the ZnHCF/MWCNT film, suggest new developments in the manufacture of translucent, flexible and light energy storage devices, which can be used as a lower-cost, safer and environmentally friendly alternative to the currently existing technologies.

TI Effects of Nanocomposite Derivatives of Ni-Fe, Ni-Co, Ni-Co-Fe Prussian
   Blue Analogues on the Thermal Decomposition Performance of
   Nitrocellulose
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The incorporation of nanomaterials generated from Prussian blue (PB) derivatives has emerged as a promising strategy to significantly improve the properties of energetic materials. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the influence of nanomaterials derived from PB on the thermal decomposition characteristics of energetic materials. To achieve this goal, we prepared nanomaterials using coprecipitation and heat treatment methods with PB derivatives as catalysts. Advanced techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis for specific surface area and pore size, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to thoroughly characterize these nanomaterials. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to assess the thermal behavior of nitrocellulose (NC), and the relevant kinetic parameters were determined through thermal decomposition kinetics calculations and analysis. This work revealed the influence of catalysts on the NC decomposition process and provided comprehensive insights into the effect of integrating nanomaterials derived from PB derivatives on the thermal decomposition performance of NC. The results of this work demonstrated the possibility of using nanomaterials generated from PB derivatives as effective catalysts to enhance the thermal decomposition characteristics of NC, offering interesting opportunities for their application in the field of high-energy materials.

TI Rational Design of N-Doped Carbon Nanocage-Equipped
   Co-Nx Active Sites for Oxidase Mimicking and Sensing
   Applications
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Rational design of high-performance nanozyme is of great significance for sensing applications. Here, N-doped carbon nanocages containing Co-N-x active sites (CoNx-NC) were fabricated by simple acid etching of Co@NC, which is the product of Co-Co Prussian blue analogues carbonized in an N-2 atmosphere. Both optimized Co@NC-650 and CoNx-NC-650 exhibit catalase- and oxidase-like properties. They rapidly decompose H2O2 into O-2 and oxidize colorless 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into a blue product. This enables them with no peroxidase-like activity. The oxidase-like activity of CoNx-NC-650 is 3.9 times that of unetched Co@NC-650. The acid treatment dissolves Co nanoparticles generated during carbonization, forming extra mesoporous structures and increasing the exposure of more Co-N-x active species. The Michaelis-Menten constant for CoNx-NC-650 with a TMB substrate is 0.186 mM, which is 3.2 times lower than that of oxidase-mimicking CeO2 nanoparticles, suggesting a higher affinity to TMB. Given its excellent oxidase-like activity, the CoNx-NC-650 was used to sensitively and selectively determine acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity based on thiocholine inhibition of the TMB color reaction. Thiocholine is produced via hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine catalyzed by AChE. The colorimetric biosensor has a linear response to AChE over 0.6-800 mU L-1 concentration range and a detection limit (3s) of 0.2 mU L-1. The assay was successfully applied to determine AChE activity in biological samples.

AB The nonlinear-opticar properties of Prussian Blue nanoparticles have been evaluated with the use of femtosecond Z-scan measurements in the 1350-1750 nm range. This well-known inorganic pigment having interesting magnetic and electrochemical properties was found to be an efficient near-IR three-photon absorber. The maximum of the effective three-photon cross section is as high as 4.5 x 10(-78) cm(6) s(2) at 1375 nm.

TI Construction of nickel/cobalt encapsulated by N-doped carbon nanotubes
   for high performance supercapacitors
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Armour-like nanomaterials could maintain high activity and stability under harsh conditions. In this paper, armour-like electrode material, Ni/Co encapsulated by N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs-Ni/Co), are prepared with Ni-Co prussian blue analogue (PBA) as precursor and template. In particular, the NCNTs-Ni/Co formed at a C3H6 flow rate of 0.2 L min-1 exhibited a high length-diameter ratio and excellent supercapacitor performance. The specific capacitance at 1 A g � 1 reached 231.2 F g � 1 and the retention rate at 20 A g � 1 was 69 %. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled from NCNTs-Ni/Co/0.2 and activated carbon (AC) exhibited a power density of 38.3 Wh kg � 1 at 800 W kg � 1 and retained the highest specific capacitance of 87.3 % after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. In general, this study gives a new idea for the derivation of structures with excellent electrochemical performance and unique structure from PBA.

TI Investigation of Valence Mixing in Sodium-Ion Battery Cathode Material
   Prussian White by Mossbauer Spectroscopy
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Prussian white (PW), Na2Fe [Fe(CN)(6)], is a highly attractive cathode material for sustainable sodium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity of similar to 170 mAhg(-1) and low-cost synthesis. However, there exists significant variability in the reported electrochemical performance. This variability originates from compositional flexibility possible for all Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) and is exasperated by the difficulty of accurately quantifying the specific composition of PW. This work presents a means of accurately quantifying the vacancy content, valence distribution, and, consequently, the overall composition of PW via Mossbauer spectroscopy. PW cathode material with three different sodium contents was investigated at 295 and 90 K. The observation of only two iron environments for the fully sodiated compound indicated the absence of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) vacancies. Due to intervalence charge transfer between iron centers at 295 K, accurate determination of valences was not possible. However, by observing the trend of spectral intensities and center shift for the nitrogen-bound and carbon-bound iron, respectively, at 90 K, valence mixing between the iron sites could be quantified. By accounting for valence mixing, the sum of iron valences agreed with the sodium content determined from elemental analysis. Without an agreement between the total valence sum and the determined composition, there exists uncertainty around the accuracy of the elemental analysis and vacancy content determination. Thus, this study offers one more stepping stone toward a more rigorous characterization of composition in PW, which will enable further optimization of properties for battery applications. More broadly, the approach is valuable for characterizing iron-based PBAs in applications where precise composition, valence determination, and control are desired.

TI Biphasic Synthesis of a Sulfur-Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide-Supported
   Co-Fe Prussian Blue Analogue: An Efficient and Durable Non-Noble
   Metal-Based Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for OER-ORR
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB The development of cost-effective, highly efficient, and enduring oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for large-scale commercialization of fuel cells, regenerative metal-air batteries, and integrated electrolyzers. Herein, we developed a simplistic biphasic synthetic strategy to obtain a nanocomposite of a cobalt Prussian blue analogue (PBCo) uniformly rooted over sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (S-rGO) support, i.e., PBCo/S-rGO. The detailed physicochemical characterization of the so-crafted catalyst referred as PBCo/S-rGO in the MS, suggests that the presented synthetic plan paves the way to a rational design of morphology with uniformly dispersed PBCo nanocubes over the basal support of S-rGO. The catalyst witnesses an overpotential (eta(10)) requirement of 340 mV for OER, surpassing commercial RuO2 in 1 M KOH. With an ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.78 V-RHE and a potential gap of just 0.79 V-RHE between the otherwise kinetically sluggish processes of OER and ORR, the PBCo/S-rGO outperforms the so-claimed state-of-art nanomaterials designed for the same purpose. The exhaustive structural characterization and in-depth electrochemical investigations clearly establish PBCo/S-rGO as a promising bifunctional OER-ORR electrocatalyst for portable fuel cells, metal-air, especially rechargeable metal-air, batteries, and OER- and ORR-based electrolyzers.

TI Highly Crystallized Na2CoFe(CN)6 with Suppressed
   Lattice Defects as Superior Cathode Material for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue and its analogues have received particular attention as superior cathodes for Na-ion batteries due to their potential 2-Na storage capacity (similar to 170 mAh g(-1)) and low cost. However, most of-the Prussian blue compounds obtained from the conventional synthetic routes contain large amounts of Fe(CN)(6) vacancies and coordinated water molecules, which leads to the collapse of cyano-bridged framework and: serious deterioration of their Na-storage ability. Herein, we propose a facile citrate-Assisted controlled crystallization method to obtain low-defect Prussian-blue lattice with greatly improved Na-storage capacity and cycling stability. As an example, the as-prepared Na2CoFe(CN)(6) nanocrystals demonstrate a reversible 2-Na storage reaction with a high specific capacity of 150 mAh g(-1) and, a similar to 90% capacity retention over 200 cycles, possibly serving as a low cost and high performance cathode for Na-ion batteries. In particular, the synthetic strategy described in this work may be extended to other coordination-framework materials for a wide range of energy conversion and storage applications.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Metal organic framework (MOF) based oxides have been widely considered as promising gas-sensing materials in the past few years. In this study, we employed a cost-efficient and simple co-precipitation method followed by annealing treatment to synthesize porous MOF-based ZnO/ZnFe2O4 (ZZFO) structure by using prussian blue analogue as self-sacrificial templates. The ZZFO exists homogeneous morphology and physical dimension, and each structure is made up of abundant primary nanocrystallite. The as-fabricated ZZFO structures sensor shows excellent gas-sensing performance toward triethylamine (TEA), including fast response and recovery speed (similar to 1 s and similar to 9 s to 100 ppm TEA), relative low operating temperature (170 degrees C), and alluring long-term stability. The results indicate that ZZFO sensor can be a promising candidate for fast and accurate detection of TEA in respects of the environmental monitoring and human health protection. Furthermore, the sensing properties and sensing mechanism have been investigated in detail. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   composite as efficient self-supported eletrocatalyst for overall water
   and urea electrolysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB It remains a challenge to explore economical, high-effective and long term stability electrocatalysts toward large-scale hydrogen production. This work utilizes surface engineering strategy to in-situ CoFe-Prussian Blue Analogues on NiCo-layered double hydroxides to obtain 3D hierarchical heterostructure precursor (NiCo-CoFe-PBA). After phosphatization, this precursor can be further transform into tri-metallic phosphide (NiCoP/CoFeP@NF) and directly act as efficient self-supported electrode for Water and Urea Electrolysis. Impressively, the obtained NiCoP/CoFeP@NF-12 (+/-) electrode shows excellent catalytic performance with only requires the cell voltage of 1.61 and 1.46 V to deliver 10 mA cm-2 in overall water splitting and urea electrolysis, respectively, which benefiting from the porous Ni foam (NF) substrate, large catalytic activity area, remarkable mass/electron transfer property, the synergistic effect of components as well as superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity of electrode surface. In addition, the experimental results also confirm that urea-assisted system has energy saving advantage superior than traditional water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the hierarchical strategy can also be introduced to the construction of other intricate composites for the utilization in energy conversion and storage.

TI Ru Prussian blue analogue-derived Ru nanoparticles composited with a

SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB In this work, we designed a straightforward and highly reproducible synthetic methodology to prepare Ru0-Pt0 composites. We report a significant improvement in the electrocatalytic performance upon compositing Ru with a very trace amount of Pt. In particular, Ru nanoparticles were derived from a Ru-Prussian blue analogue (Ru PBA) and composited with (0.1, 0.5, and 1 mmol) metallic platinum following an optimized chemical reduction method. Interestingly, the composite with 0.5 mmol of Pt (Ru@C/Pt0.5) required low overpotentials of 32 and 140 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. Furthermore, Ru@C/Pt0.5 exhibited a smaller Tafel slope (26 mV dec-1), robust durability with 50 hours of long-term stability and a higher turnover frequency (TOF: 5.6 s-1@eta 10 mA cm-2) than commercial Pt/C (TOF: 4.1 s-1@eta 10 mA cm-2). First-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) revealed that the existence of Pt islands on the Ru nanoparticles weakened the strength of the adsorption of hydrogen at the Ru interstitials due to electrostatic repulsion caused by charge retention at Ru atoms near the corner of the islands, leading to rapid dissociation of hydrogen. This created a significant impact on the improvement of the electrocatalytic HER activity of the Ru@C/Pt0.5 electrocatalyst. It appears that restricting the concentration of Pt to trace amounts is a necessary condition for the observed catalytic efficiency, as the catalytic efficiency decreases with an increasing island size due to stronger binding of atomic hydrogen on peripheral Pt atoms and stabilization of adsorbed atomic hydrogen caused by softening of phonon modes with increasing island size. This study opens up a novel avenue for the exploration of highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions.
   An Ru/Pt nanocomposite, i.e. Ru@C/Pt0.5, derived from Ru-PBA act as an excellent electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), delivering a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm-2 at only a small overpotential of 32 mV.

   preferred, tight, robust, water soluble, and kinetically inert
   encapsulator
SO INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB The preparation of a caesium inclusion complex of the molecular cube [{CoIII(Me3-tacn)}4{FeII(CN)6}4]}]4-, a mixed valent molecular Prussian Blue Analogue bearing bridging cyanido ligands, has been achieved by following a redox-triggered self-assembly process in aqueous solution. The assembly has been shown to be Cspreferred as, even in the presence of Na+ in solution, no Na-encapsulated have been found in the assembled product when Cs+ is present in the reaction medium. Even so, the tightness of the system produces large amounts of a void cubic structure whenever not large excesses of Cs+ are present. The species is robust, extremely soluble in aqueous media, pH-stable in the 1-13 range, and redox inactive between -400 and 600 mV. The molecular species has been characterised by UV-vis, ICP, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, and electrochemistry. As expected from previous data reported, the complex in aqueous solution is totally inert to cation exchange, the leaching of the encapsulated Cs+ being hampered by the small size of the cube portal.

TI Copper and nickel hexacyanoferrates/carbon nanotube nanocomposites thin
   films as high-performance light cathode materials for aqueous sodium-ion
   batteries
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Aqueous rechargeable Na-ion batteries are gaining popularity as an attractive alternative for energy storage systems due to their low cost, wide range of raw material sources, non-flammability, and ultrahigh ionic conductivity. Currently, Because of their three-dimensional open structure, high specific capacity, and inexpensive cost, Prussian blue analogues are being investigated as electrode materials for electrochemistry. In this work, we present an innovative strategy to create novel two-component nanoarchitected thin films that exhibit exceptional performance as cathodes in aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). By leveraging the versatility of the liquid-liquid interfacial method, we have prepared two distinct transparent nanocomposite films composed of carbon nanotubes and either copper or nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles. The results show that the NiHCF/CNT and CuHCF/CNT deliver a high specific capacity of 152 mA h g(-1) and 135 mA h g(-1), respectively, at a high current density of 1 A g(-1). Moreover, the cells (rGO//NiHCF and rGO//CuHCF) show that the energy density of the battery can reach up to 7.75 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 27.92 W kg(-1) for rGO//NiHCF/CNT, while rGO//CuHCF/CNT showed an energy density of 3.67 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 13.21 W kg(-1). The results demonstrate that NiHCF/CNT and CuHCF/CNT nanocomposite films provide new insight into the design of high-performance PBA cathodes.

TI Deciphering the Synergistic Effect in Strong Metal-Support Interaction
   toward Surface Reconstruction of Prussian Blue Analogue-Based
   Pre-Catalysts for Boosted Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis via
   Operando Raman Spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect in Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has been widely investigated and is credited for the enhanced activity, selectivity, and durability for electrocatalysis reactions. However, deciphering the contribution of individual components and identifying the active sites in PBA-based pre-catalysts for electrocatalysts are seldom realized. Herein, we report the unraveling of the synergism in a cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) PBA pre-catalyst-decorated three-dimensional (3D) network of interlinked graphene oxide and functionalized carbon nanotubes (GO/f-CNT) for the boosted bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We find that the SMSI between CoHCF and GO/f-CNT modulates the surface reconstruction of the PBA pre-catalyst for boosted activity and durability. Besides, the SMSI effect leads to a change in the rate-determining step (RDS) from surface-adsorption-limited over CoHCF to charge-transfer-controlled over CoHCF/GO/f-CNT during the ORR. Operando Raman spectroscopy confirms this finding and demonstrates the lowered overpotential for the ORR over GO/f-CNT predominantly due to efficient adsorption of O-2(-) (an ORR intermediate), while CoHCF provides a 4-electron ORR pathway. In the OER, the leaching of Fe(CN)(6) species from the CoHCF pre-catalyst under alkaline conditions generates OER-active CoOOH/FeOOH on the surface.

Hollow and solid nanospheres of the Prussian yellow materials were successfully synthesized with suitable experimental conditions. It is found that the amounts of organic additives CTAB could result in the formation of the spherical nanocrystals and the hydrolysis of phosphate in the solution could play a role in the final morphology of the products.

TI Synthesis of prussian blue analog (Co/TCNi/HCCr) nanoparticles using a
   facile co-precipitation approach and evaluation of their dielectric
   characteristics for electronic applications
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
AB The Prussian blue analog Co-0.4/(TCNi)(0.2)/(HCCr)(0.6) (PBA) nanoparticles were synthesized via a chemical co-precipitation approach. The structural characteristics of the nanocomposite (NCp) were investigated using the XRD technique, which revealed that the synthetic PBA has a tiny crystallite size and poor crystallinity. The XRD analysis suggests that the fabricated NCp has a face-centered cubic structure with space group Fm-3 m. For deep microstructure analysis, SEM, EDX, and AFM were employed to describe the topological nature and surface architecture. It is observed that the PBA nanocomposite has a small crystallite size of similar to 13.66 +/- 0.32 nm. The particles' surface displays a high degree of homogeneity, while the grain boundaries are clearly discernible, presenting a spherical morphology with an average diameter of 22 +/- 2.1 nm. The porosity was ascertained from an AFM image of approximately 140. Furthermore, the value of the average roughness (R-s) is 6.86 nm. The AC conductivity of PBA in disc form was calculated at various temperatures and frequencies. The results indicate that the dielectric constant (epsilon ') of PBA nanoparticles exhibits a rise from 163 to 3464 throughout the frequency range of 10-100 kHz at ambient temperature and from 27 to 6000 at 293 K. This finding provides confirmation that the dielectric characteristics of PBA nanoparticles are enhanced during the process of annealing. The values of the exponent factor (s) range from 0 to 1; this behavior is connected to the correlated barrier hopping model (CBHM) for AC conductivity. The value of W-M was ascertained to be 1.69 eV. Furthermore, the values of activation energy were calculated, and these values decreased from 0.20 to 0.17 eV with annealing. The change in loss tangent (tan delta) as a function of angular frequency at various temperatures is also shown. The investigation of the dielectric characteristics was measured over a wide range of frequencies and temperatures to get valuable data about the dissipation properties of the prospective electronic applications.

TI Nickel hexacyanoferrate electrodes for high mono/divalent
   ion-selectivity in capacitive deionization
SO DESALINATION
AB Selective ion removal has been a point of focus in capacitive deionization because of its industrial applications such as water purification, water softening, heavy metal separation and resource recovery. Conventionally, carbon is used as electrode material for selectivity. However, recent developments focus on intercalation materials such as Prussian Blue Analogues, due to their size-based preference towards cations. Selectivity of nickel hexacyanoferrate electrodes from a mixture of Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions was studied in this work. Here, a CDI cell with two identical NiHCF electrodes was operated in two desalination modes: (a) cyclic, in which ions are removed from and released into the same water reservoir and thus, the ion concentration remains the same after one cycle, and (b) continuous, in which ions are removed from one water reservoir and released back in a different reservoir. An average separation factor of approximate to 15 and 25, reflecting the selectivity of the electrodes, was obtained for Na+ over Ca2+ and Mg2+ from an equimolar solution of Na+ Ca2+ and Mg2+ in both, cyclic and continuous desalination. It was concluded that NiHCF, used in a symmetric CDI cell, is a promising material for highly selective removal of Na+ from a multivalent ion mixture.

TI Prussian blue analog nanocubes tuning synthesis of coral-like
   Ni3S2@MIL-53(NiFeCo) core-shell nanowires array
   and boosting oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Developing highly-efficient and robust electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to relieve energy crisis. Herein, a facile two-step method involving Prussian blue nanocubes as template is introduced to synthesize coral-like Ni3S2@MIL-53(NiFeCo) core-shell nanowires array as an excellent OER electrocatalyst. The metal sulfides as a core in the core-shell structure could effectively adjust the morphology of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in the shell layer forming ultrathin 2D MOFs nanosheets. The synthesized Ni3S2@MIL-53 (NiFeCo)/NF nanowires exhibit excellent activity, which needs overpotential of only 236 mV to drive high current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. This excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the following aspects: 1) The synergy between the metal sulfides and the MOF contributes substantially to the OER performance. 2) The compact three-dimensional nano-array structure increases the electrochemically active surface area of Ni3S2@MIL-53(NiFeCo)/NF nanowires; which promotes electrolyte permeation and gas overflow. 3) The tight integration of the vertically aligned nanowires structure with the conductive substrate ensures rapid electron transport and ultra-high structural stability of the electrode material. We anticipate that our research will extend the strategy for assembling advanced materials as an effective electrocatalyst for OER.

TI Polybenzoxazine-Derived N-doped Carbon as Matrix for Powder-Based

SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB In addition to catalytic activity, intrinsic stability, tight immobilization on a suitable electrode surface, and sufficient electronic conductivity are fundamental prerequisites for the long-term operation of particle-and especially powder-based electrocatalysts. We present a novel approach to concurrently address these challenges by using the unique properties of polybenzoxazine (pBO) polymers, namely near-zero shrinkage and high residual-char yield even after pyrolysis at high temperatures. Pyrolysis of a nanocubic prussian blue analogue precursor (KmMnx[Co(CN)(6)](y)center dot nH(2)O) embedded in a bisphenol A and aniline-based pBO led to the formation of a N-doped carbon matrix modified with MnxCoyOz nanocubes. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits high efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and more importantly a stable performance for at least 65 h.

TI Sodium iron hexacyanoferrate with high Na content as a Na-rich cathode
   material for Na-ion batteries
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB Owing to the worldwide abundance and low-cost of Na, room-temperature Na-ion batteries are emerging as attractive energy storage systems for large-scale grids. Increasing the Na content in cathode materials is one of the effective ways to achieve high energy density. Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) are promising Na-rich cathode materials since they can theoretically store two Na+ ions per formula unit. However, increasing the Na content in PBAs cathode materials remains a major challenge. Here we show that sodium iron hexacyanoferrate with high Na content can be obtained by simply controlling the reducing agent and reaction atmosphere during synthesis. The Na content can reach as high as 1.63 per formula, which is the highest value for sodium iron hexacyanoferrate. This Na-rich sodium iron hexacyanoferrate demonstrates a high specific capacity of 150 mAh center dot g(-1) and remarkable cycling performance with 90% capacity retention after 200 cycles. Furthermore, the Na intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism has been systematically studied by in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis for the first time. The Na-rich sodium iron hexacyanoferrate can function as a plenteous Na reservoir and has great potential as a cathode material for practical Na-ion batteries.

SO SMALL METHODS
AB Recently, aqueous metal-ion batteries have attracted significant attention, as they can provide rather efficient and safe solutions with regard to large-scale renewable energy storage applications. However, better fundamental understanding of the electrode and electrolyte materials for these devices is necessary to advance their performance. The research methodology for well-known types of batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries, relies on numerous available cell designs and protocols. Fundamental research in the field of aqueous metal-ion batteries, on the contrary, still requires the development of new, original, and versatile cells as well as procedures to improve the efficiency and informative power of experiments. In this work, a concept for the research cell design dedicated to the aqueous metal-ion batteries is presented, enabling advanced electrochemical characterization of model electrode materials (including the mass changes of the active electrodes). Electrodes based on Prussian blue analogs, which are state-of-the-art electrode materials for aqueous Na-ion batteries, are used to demonstrate the concept.

TI Soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy study of the electronic structures of
   the MnFe Prussian blue analogs
   (RbxBay)Mn[3-(x+2y)]/2[Fe(CN)6</su
   b>]H2O
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The electronic structures of Prussian blue analog (RbxBay) Mn[3-(x+2y)]/2[Fe(CN)(6)] cyanides have been investigated by employing soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Fe and Mn L (2p) edges. The measured XAS spectra have been analyzed with the configuration-interaction (CI) cluster model calculations. The valence states of the Fe and Mn ions are found to be Fe2+-Fe3+ mixed valent, with an average valency of v(Fe) similar to 2.8 and nearly divalent (Mn2+), respectively. Our Mn/Fe 2p XMCD study supports that Mn2+ ions are in the high-spin states while Fe2+-Fe3+ ions are in the low-spin states. The Fe and Mn 2p XAS spectra are found to be essentially the same for 80 <= T <= 300 K, suggesting that a simple charge transfer upon cooling from Fe3+- CN-Mn2+ to Fe (2+)-CN-Mn3+ does not occur in (RbxBay) Mn[3-(x+2y)]/2[Fe(CN)(6)]. According to the CI cluster model analysis, it is necessary to take into account both the ligand-to-metal charge transfer and the metal-to-ligand charge transfer in describing Fe 2p XAS, while the effect of charge transfer is negligible in describing Mn 2p XAS. The CI cluster model analysis also shows that the trivalent Fe3+ ions have a strong covalent bonding with the C equivalent to N ligands and are under a large crystal-field energy of 10Dq similar to 3 eV, in contrast to the weak covalency effect and a small 10Dq similar to 0.6 eV for the divalent Mn2+ ions.

TI Research status and prospect of rechargeable magnesium ion batteries
   cathode materials
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB Rechargeable magnesium ion batteries (RMBs) are investigated as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) alternatives owing to their favorable merits of high energy density, abundance and low expenditure of Mg, as well as especially non-toxic safety and low risk of dendrite formation in anodes, which endows them to be more easily assembled in electric-power vehicles for the extended application of civilian-military fields. Nevertheless, the high charge density, strong polarization effect, and slow diffusion kinetics of Mg2 +remain a large obstacle and thus enormous efforts have to be paid to mend the gap with commercial demand for cathode materials. At present, RMBs cathode materials mainly contain transition metal sulfides/oxides, polyanionic compounds and Prussian blue analogs, and several methods such as nano structuring, doping regulation and coating modification have been applied to materials design for better performance. In this paper, the current research status of RMBs cathode materials at home & abroad is arranged and summarized along with challenges of development in the future focusing on synthesis of RMBs cathode materials with high energy density as well as satisfactory cycling performance. And this analysis aims to provide reference and basis for researchers working on RMBs technology advancement.

TI Na2Co3[Fe(CN)6]2: A
   promising cathode material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB A Prussian blue analogue, Na2Co3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), has been fabricated by a facile co-precipitation method at room temperature as a potential cathode material for both lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. It found that the Na2Co3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) nanoparticles with a primary particle size of 30-40 nm have been synthesized, and exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance, including a long cycling behavior in lithium-ion batteries and a good rate performance in sodium-ion batteries. In lithium-ion batteries, the Na2Co3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) nanoparticles cathode can deliver an excellent cyclic performance with 73.0% retention of initial capacity after 50 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). Moreover, when Na2Co3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) is used as cathode material of sodium-ion batteries, it exhibits an outstanding rate performance exceeding 75.2% retention of initial capacity after 50 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). Therefore, the Na2Co3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) nanoparticles can be a potential cathode candidate for the application of lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries due to its excellent electrochemical performance, easy preparation, low cost and environment benefits.

TI Reactant Concentration and Aging-Time-Regulated Potassium Manganese
   Hexacyanoferrate as a Superior Cathode for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB In this study, the sodium citrate assisted coprecipitation method was adopted to prepare high-quality potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) by adjusting the reactant concentration and aging time. The influences of reactant concentration and aging time on the microstructures and electrochemical performance were investigated systematically. With the variations in preparation conditions, the as-prepared samples showed similar monoclinic crystal structure but different morphologies as well as electrochemical behaviors. The results proved that the lower reactant concentration is more beneficial to the formation of large particles with fewer defects of Fe(CN)6 vacancies and interstitial and coordinated water in the crystal structure. As a result, better cycling stability was obtained for the KMHCF1 samples prepared with a lower reactant concentration when compared to the KMHCF3 samples prepared with a higher reactant concentration. However, the small particles (KMHCF3) benefited the electrochemical kinetics, resulting in a larger specific capacity when compared with the large particles (KMHCF1). Similarly, the aging time also exhibited significant impacts on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared samples. The 24 h was confirmed to be the optimal aging time for the KMHCF samples. Among all samples, the KMHCF2_24h exhibited the best electrochemical performance with a large initial specific capacity of 140.3 mA h g(-1) and a high capacity retention of 80.61% after 100 cycles at 20 mA g(-1). A very high capacity retention of 85.02% after 500 cycles was achieved even at a high current density of 200 mA g(-1). This should be ascribed to the regular cubic morphology of particles with the optimal size (1 mu m) and less defects resulted from the optimal reactant concentration and aging time. This study provides a valuable and practical guidance for the synthesis of highperformance Prussian blue analogue cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.

TI Fabrication of hollow cubic silica nanoframes with a fibrous morphology
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB A series of fibrous silica core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated by using Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) as hard templates in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. Other than normal synthesis of fibrous silica, KOH was used instead of urea in the fabrication which was operated at lower temperature 40 degrees C without any cosolvent. Synthesized PBA@fibrous silica NPs could be easily oxidized to Co-Fe oxides@fibrous silica nanostructures. Furthermore, after acid etching process, corresponding hollow cubic silica nanoframes (HCSNF) with a fibrous morphology were finally achieved. Characterization results revealed that the size distribution of HCSNFs was 300 +/- 46 nm. Each HCSNF had a novel hollow region. This low-temperature cosolvent-free fabrication provides a new idea for expanding efficient synthetic methods and morphology of fibrous silica shell. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Essential role of the interfacial interaction in the core-shell
   electrode for its enhanced electrochemical performance
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Interfacial interaction in the core-shell hybrid materials makes a great influence for the enhanced electrochemical performances. In this paper, to explore the essential role of the interfacial interaction in the core-shell hybrid electrodes, we prepare a simple mutually-coupled 3D heterogeneous core/shell electrode by NiFe PBAs (Prussian blue analogues) (shell) depositing on the surface of NiFe LDH (layered double hydroxides) (core). The elements of Fe and Ni in NiFe LDH can partly replace the original connections in the NiFe PBAs thus forming a strong interfacial coordination bonding between LDH and PBAs (Fe/Ni(LDH)-CN-Fe/Ni(PBAs) or O-Fe/Ni (PBAs)). Electrochemical tests show that the hybridization present excellent electrochemical performances with a high capacity of 1351 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), which is much higher than that of PBAs-based electrodes recently report. In-situ Raman spectroscopic analysis shows that NiFe LDH@NiFe PBAs present enhanced Faradic redox reaction during charging/discharging process, which is owing to the strong interfacial interaction between two phases. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations results demonstrate that the strong connection bonding can improve the electrical conductivities greatly. This work underscores the crucial role of interface coupling interaction between core and shell and give a new perspective to design core-shell hybrid electrode with excellent electrochemical performance.

TI Tuning the Particle Size of Prussian Blue by a Dual Anion Source Method
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB The preparation of coordination polymer nano particles with different sizes has been currently the focus of research attention in many fields such as gas storage, batteries, drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging, etc. In this paper, we reported a facile dual anion source (DAS) method to prepare Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles with different particle sizes. With the increasing of Fe-II(CN)(6)(4-) reactant usage proportions, the mean size of PB particles increased from 100 nm to 1.6 mu m. Such a wide size range was found closely related to the different nucleation processes with varied chemical compositions (proportions of Fe(II) and Fe(III)) of the products. With increasing Fe(II) content in both ends of the cyanide bridge, the 4 PB nucleus generation rate would descend in the product nucleation period. The reported DAS method exploited a new synthetic strategy for controlling the particle size of PB particles. The results would contribute to the research on other coordination polymers in the future.

TI A stochastic DNA walker electrochemiluminescence biosensor based on
   quenching effect of Pt@CuS on luminol@Au/Ni-Co nanocages for
   ultrasensitive detection of I27L gene
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The common I27L mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A) significantly increase the incidence of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Hence, the establishment of an ultrasensitive detection strategy for I27L gene is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of MODY. Herein, a signal-off electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) biosensor with effective target-induced stochastic DNA walker amplification was fabricated for I27L detection. In this biosensor, Prussian blue analogues (Ni-Co) nanocages/Ausupported luminol (luminol@Au/Ni-Co) were used as ECL donors and exhibited excellent luminous efficiency. On the other hand, Pt nanoparticles-grown on copper sulphide (Pt@CuS) were used as energy acceptors to quench the initial signal based on RET between luminol and CuS. Moreover, the autonomous locomotion of I27L assisted by Exo III is the key in this DNA walker biosensor, as it continually induces new digestion processes on the electrode surface and quenches signals caused by the introduction of numerous acceptors. The efficient donor/acceptor pairs and DNA walker amplification system of the ECL-RET allowed the proposed biosensor to effectively detect I27L with a wide linear range of 0.0001 to 100 nM and a limit of detection as low as 23 fM. Thus, the ECL-RET biosensor provides a promising sensing platform for the diagnosis and typing of diabetes.

TI Divalent Ion Selectivity in Capacitive Deionization with Vanadium
   Hexacyanoferrate: Experiments and Quantum-Chemical Computations
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Selective removal of ions from water via capacitive deionization (CDI) is relevant for environmental and industrial applications like water purification, softening, and resource recovery. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are proposed as an electrode material for selectively removing cations from water, based on their size. So far, PBAs used in CDI are selective toward monovalent ions. Here, vanadium hexacyanoferrate (VHCF), a PBA, is introduced as a new electrode material in a hybrid CDI setup to selectively remove divalent cations from water. These electrodes prefer divalent Ca(2+ )over monovalent Na+, with a separation factor, beta(Ca/Na )approximate to 3.5. This finding contrasts with the observed monovalent ion selectivity by PBA electrodes. This opposite behavior is understood by density functional theory simulations. Furthermore, coating the VHCF electrodes with a conducting polymer (poly-pyrrole, doped with poly-styrenesulphonate) prevents the contamination of the treated water following the degradation of the electrode. This facile and modular coating method can be effortlessly extended to other PBA electrodes, limiting the extent of treated water contamination during repeated cycling. This study paves the way for tunable selectivity while extending the library of electrodes that can be successfully used in (selective) CDI.

TI Amorphous Bimetallic Oxide-Graphene Hybrids as Bifunctional Oxygen
   Electrocatalysts for Rechargeable Zn-Air Batteries
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Metal oxides of earth-abundant elements are promising electrocatalysts to overcome the sluggish oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction (OER/ORR) in many electrochemical energy-conversion devices. However, it is difficult to control their catalytic activity precisely. Here, a general three-stage synthesis strategy is described to produce a family of hybrid materials comprising amorphous bimetallic oxide nanoparticles anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide with simultaneous control of nanoparticle elemental composition, size, and crystallinity. Amorphous Fe0.5Co0.5Ox is obtained from Prussian blue analog nanocrystals, showing excellent OER activity with a Tafel slope of 30.1 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 257 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and superior ORR activity with a large limiting current density of -5.25 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V. A fabricated Zn-air battery delivers a specific capacity of 756 mA h g(Zn)(-1) (corresponding to an energy density of 904 W h kg(Zn)(-1)), a peak power density of 86 mW cm(-2) and can be cycled over 120 h at 10 mA cm(-2). Other two amorphous bimetallic, Ni0.4Fe0.6Ox and Ni0.33Co0.67Ox, are also produced to demonstrate the general applicability of this method for synthesizing binary metal oxides with controllable structures as electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

TI Gradient substitution: an intrinsic strategy towards high performance
   sodium storage in Prussian blue-based cathodes
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Benefiting from the abundance of sodium, rechargeable sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are preferred over lithium ion batteries (LIBs) in large-scale storage of electrical energy. Low-cost Prussian blue (PB) is a promising cathode because of its ease of synthesis and rigid open framework. Nevertheless, the less activated low spin Fe in FeC6 octahedron lowers the average potential and the overall capacity, while the lattice vacancies and side reactions between low spin Fe and the electrolyte shortens PB's cycling life. Herein, PB with a controllable gradient nickel substitution, which features a high-Ni-content outer layer and low-Ni-content inner layer in a single grain, is demonstrated for high performance sodium storage. The high-Ni-content outer layer efficiently prevents side reactions, ensuring excellent cycling stability, while a small amount of nickel ions in the inner layer efficiently activates the low spin Fe for achieving high capacity. Taking the above synergistic advantages, our gradient-PB exhibits a high reversible capacity of 114 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and 84 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) with very stable cycling for up to 1000 cycles. Gradient substitution in PB analogues provides a novel strategy for exploring high performance PB-based cathodes for SIBs.

TI Surface engineering induced urchin-like CuFe oxides on copper foam for
   highly sensitive non-enzymatic glucose sensing
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB Surface morphology and catalytic sites are crucial for constructing self-supported electrode applying in non-enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensing. In this study, we adopted a surface engineering strategy to coat Prussian blue analogue (PBA) on Cu foam as precursor, and the thickness of PBA film controls the morphology and component content of the annealing products, CuFe oxides supported on Cu foam (CuFeOx/CF). With optimal PBA film thickness, CuFeOx/CF can be endowed with urchin-like morphology and multiple catalytic sites. The urchin-like CuFeOx/CF possessed more electrochemical active surface area, stronger electrocatalytic ability, and less charge transfer resistance than CuOx/CF obtained from direct annealing CF. Thus, the CuFeOx/CF was proved to be an effective platform for electrochemical glucose sensing, owing to the hierarchical structure, component synergistic effect and excellent electrical conductivity. Specifically, high sensitivity of 9536 and 2614 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) at corresponding linear concentration range of 4.9-396 and 396-1224 mu M, and low limit of detection of 0.55 mu Mu (S/N=3) were achieved by CuFeOx/CF electrode in glucose sensing. Moreover, fast response, excellent reproducibility, superior long-term stability, robust anti-interference ability, and satisfactory practical recovery in non-enzymatic glucose analysis were effectuated by designed CuFeOx/CF sensor. This study demonstrated the surface engineering induced CuFeOx/CF can be an ideal self-supported electrode for non-enzymatic glucose sensor with high sensitivity and stability.

TI Evaluating polyanthranilic acid as a polymeric template for the
   production of Prussian blue nanoclusters
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The electropolymerization of anthranilic acid (2-aminobenzoic acid) has been shown to lead to the production of a redox polymer functionalized with carboxylate groups capable of complexing metal ions. The polymer was exploited as a means of capturing ferric ion from solution with the iron decorated polymer chains used as seeding points for the formation of Prussian blue (PB). Nanoclusters of PB were dispersed throughout the three-dimensional polymer matrix with deposition achieved through direct electrochemical means or via a dip process. The latter exploited the chemical combination of Fe(III) + Ferrocyanide to yield PB allowing its dispersal of the PB throughout the polymer film. The polymer film and its subsequent modification have been characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray analysis, Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. The stability toward peroxide has also been explored.

TI Novel porous Mn-Fe nanocubes toward peroxymonosulfate activation via
   non-radical/radical pathways for emerging contaminants degradation
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Novel porous Mn-Fe nanocubes (p-MnFe NCs) with abundant oxygen vacancies, which derived from Mn-Fe prussian blue analogue, were fabricated for the first time through annealing at H-2 atmosphere. Among the different molar ratios of Mn/Fe, p-Mn1Fe1 NCs possessed abundant oxygen vacancies and exhibited excellent performance for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation to effectively degrade bisphenol A (BPA). As a result, 100% BPA (20 mg/L) degradation efficiency can be achieved within 30 min in the p-Mn1Fe1 NCs/PMS system. SO4 center dot-, HO center dot, O-2(center dot-) and O-1(2) were confirmed as main reactive oxygen species during catalytic reaction. The exposed Mn and Fe sites on the surface of p-Mn1Fe1 NCs were the main active sites for the generation of reactive radicals. For non-radical generation pathway, the generated O-1(2) and O-2(center dot-) mainly originated from the reaction between dissolved oxygen and surface oxygen vacancies, and parts of O-1(2) originated from the formation of intermediate O-2(center dot-). Radical and non-radical pathways were proposed in the p-Mn1Fe1 NCs/PMS system for insights into the mechanisms of BPA degradation. Finally, the possible degradation pathways were proposed via ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-Q-MS) analysis.

TI Prussian blue analogue in situ derived hierarchical flower-like
   ZnS/FeS2 Z-scheme heterojunction for boosted visible-light
   responsive photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B with synergistic
   peroxydisulfate activation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB A micro/nano hierarchical flower-like ZnS/FeS2 direct Z-scheme heterojunction visible-light catalyst was in situ derived from a Prussian blue analogue cube (Zn-Fe PBA) using a facile one-pot hydrothermal sulfidation strategy. The as-prepared ZnS/FeS2 catalyst shows extraordinarily boosted visible-light photocatalytic degradability for Rhodamine B (RhB) with the synergism of peroxydisulfate (PDS). Under visible-light illumination, 98.5% degradation efficiency can be achieved within 15 min and 100% within 20 min with excellent structural stability of ZnS/FeS2. The degradation kinetic constant of ZnS/FeS2 + PDS is 9.33 times that of ZnS/FeS2, 23.02 times that of p-ZnS/FeS2, 24.05 times that of FeS2, and 28.25 times that of ZnS, respectively. The ZnS/FeS2 heterojunction shows significant synergistic benefits in the photocatalytic degradation reaction. More advantageously, ZnS/FeS2 + PDS shows excellent photocatalytic degradation performance in a wide pH range (1-10). A reasonable direct Z-scheme heterojunction mechanism for visible-light responsive photocatalytic degradation of RhB with OH, h(+), O-2(-), and SO4- as the crucial active species is recommended for the ZnS/FeS2 + PDS composite system. The micro/nano hierarchical flower-like structure of ZnS/FeS2 simultaneously combines the high activity of nano-materials with the advantages of easy recycling of micro-sized materials. The in situ transformation characteristics of ZnS/FeS2 from the PBA template contribute to the advantageous high performance and structural stability.

TI High-Entropy Metal-Organic Frameworks for Highly Reversible Sodium
   Storage
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are reported to be efficient sodium storage materials because of the unique advantages of their metal-organic framework structure. However, the issues of low specific capacity and poor reversibility, caused by phase transitions during charge/discharge cycling, have thus far limited the applicability of these materials. Herein, a new approach is presented to substantially improve the electrochemical properties of PBAs by introducing high entropy into the crystal structure. To achieve this, five different metal species are introduced, sharing the same nitrogen-coordinated site, thereby increasing the configurational entropy of the system beyond 1.5R. By careful selection of the elements, high-entropy PBA (HE-PBA) presents a quasi-zero-strain reaction mechanism, resulting in increased cycling stability and rate capability. The key to such improvement lies in the high entropy and associated effects as well as the presence of several active redox centers. The gassing behavior of PBAs is also reported. Evolution of dimeric cyanogen due to oxidation of the cyanide ligands is detected, which can be attributed to the structural degradation of HE-PBA during battery operation. By optimizing the electrochemical window, a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% is retained after cycling for more than 3000 cycles.

TI Fabrication of CdS Frame-in-Cage Particles for Efficient Photocatalytic
   Hydrogen Generation under Visible-Light Irradiation
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The design of advanced structures for semiconductor photocatalysts is an effective approach to enhance their performance toward solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Hollow and frame-like structures show advantageous features for photocatalytic reactions with enlarged surface area, shortened charge-transfer distance, promoted light-absorption ability, and enhanced mass-transfer capability. Here, a facile two-step sulfidation strategy is developed to fabricate unique CdS frame-in-cage particles for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Cd-based Prussian blue analog (Cd-PBA) cubes are first converted to Cd-PBA cube-in-CdS cage particles, which are further transformed to CdS frame-in-cage particles. Benefiting from the novel frame-in-cage structure, the obtained CdS photocatalyst exhibits high activity under visible-light irradiation with the hydrogen generation rate of 13.6 mmol h(-1)g(-1), which is much enhanced compared with those of the CdS cubes and cages.

TI High-density cathode structure of independently acting
   Prussian-blue-analog nanoparticles: a high-power Zn-Na-ion battery
   discharging ∼200 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at 1000C
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Sustainable societies demand ultrahigh-power batteries to discharge explosive electricity. Herein, we use current densities (mA cm(-2)) to measure high power when comparing different laboratory-scale loading amounts (several mg cm(-2)) of redox-active materials. Current densities are improved by increasing discharge currents (A g(-1)) in conjunction with loading amounts. However, maintaining the theoretical capacities of cathodes at ultrahigh rates of >= 100C remains challenging. Independently acting nanoparticles (NPs) are most effective in boosting the C-rate capabilities of cathodes by improving sluggish kinetics via shortened ion-diffusion length. Therefore, we fabricate aggregation-free cathodes through the one-step filtration of independently water-dispersed surface-modified NPs of Prussian-blue analogs (metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs), M = Zn, Cu, and Mn) along with single-walled carbon nanotubes. ZnHCF NPs are densely stacked between 1.0 and 1.3 g cm(-3) while maintaining nanometer-scale spaces around each NP. These spaces are filled with electrolyte solutions, enabling the NPs to act independently. In Zn-Na-ion batteries, an unprecedented charge/discharge rate mismatch between cathodes and Zn-foil anodes is investigated by changing the loading amounts of NPs. The low-loading amounts of <= 0.50 mg cm(-2) achieve synchronized charge/discharge profiles ranging from 100 (1.64) to 1000C (operating voltage, 1.53 V) with retained discharge capacities of >= 97%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to conduct at least 150 000 charge/discharge cycles at 400C. At a high loading amount of 3.0 mg cm(-2), the capacity charged to the theoretical value at 300C is almost fully discharged at 1000C/66 A g(-1) with high-power outputs of 198 mA cm(-2)/246 mW cm(-2). In Ragone plots, Zn-Na/K-ion batteries using MHCFs exhibit ultrahigh-power densities of 10(4)-10(5) W kg(-1) with energy densities of 90-200 W h kg(-1). The unique cathode structure thereby shows a promising avenue for overcoming the tradeoff between densifying NPs and increasing current densities for future ultrahigh-power batteries.

TI Rational design of multiple Prussian-blue analogues/NF composites for
   high-performance surpercapacitors
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB In this study, a series of NiCoxFe1-x-PBA/NF (nickel foam) electrodes were successfully fabricated with different ratios of Co and Fe through anin situchemical etching process. Their structures and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Remarkably, this novel series of composites exhibit excellent supercapacitor performance. Among them, the NiCo-PBA/NF electrode exhibits the best electrochemical performance with an area specific capacitance of 2242 mF cm(-2)at 1 mA cm(-2)in 3 M KOH solution and good cycling stability. Furthermore, asymmetric supercapacitor cells with NiCo-PBA/NF as the positive electrode and active carbon coated on the nickel foam as the negative electrode deliver a very high energy density of 39.4 W h kg(-1)and a high power density of 4003 W kg(-1), which far exceed those of other devices reported previously. This work highlights the designing strategy of such composite materials with an optimized synergistic effect, which greatly promotes the supercapacitor development.

TI A new research perspective: The application of potassiated alloy/carbon
   composite counter electrode in fundamental and practical research of
   K-ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Many efforts were made to modify cathode materials for K-ion batteries to improve their performance. However, the improvements are not so significant. Herein, we show that the performance of host materials are limited by metal K counter electrode, which leads to underestimation of materials. With a potassiated alloy/carbon composite counter electrode, the Prussian blue analogue cathode can show outstanding rate capability at 5000 mA g(-1) and operate 1000 cycles without capacity fading. Besides, when the anode utilization increased to 72.7%, the battery parameters, such as lifespan, energy and power density, were also promising. This work offers a new perspective for both fundamental and practical research of K-ion batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Epitaxial Nucleation of NaxFeFe(CN)6@rGO with
   Improved Lattice Regularity as Ultrahigh-Rate Cathode for Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Although Prussian blue analogues are the promising candidate cathode materials for the Na-ion batteries for the grid storage due to 3D open-framework structure and large interstitial "A" sites, high content of defects in the crystals obtained in the conventional strategy severely impede Na+ migration, leading to an unsatisfactory power density. Here a novel epitaxial nucleation-assisted controlled crystallization approach to eliminate the structural defects of NaFeHCF crystals is reported. Due to their limited lattice misfit of only 4.87% (< 5%) between the graphene and NaFeHCF as well as the electronegativity of the functional groups (& horbar;COOH, & horbar;OH, & horbar;CH(O)CH & horbar;), GO can act as the nucleation and subsequent epitaxial growth platform of NaFeHCF, which results in a unique one-corner-cut cubic nano-crystals morphologies with much decreased contents of defects (0.08 per formula unit). This enhanced lattice regularity significantly enhanced the speedy diffusion of Na cations (by 5 times) in the nanocrystals, resulting in the unprecedented rate capability of 96.8 mAh g(-1) at an ultra-high rate of 9 A g(-1) (39 s, 23228 W kg(-1)), which is far exceeding that of any previously reported PBA-based cathodes to the knowledge, authenticating its superiority as a candidate for high-power sodium-ion batteries for the reliable grid energy storage.

TI Density-functional-theory-predicted symmetry lowering from cubic to
   tetragonal in nickel hexacyanoferrate
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
AB Density-functional-theory (DFT) computations on a Prussian blue analogue (PBA), nickel hexacyanoferrate, Ni-3(2+)[Fe3+(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O, predict the existence of a tetragonal (P (4) over bar m2) crystal structure that is energetically degenerate with the previously reported cubic (F (4) over bar 3m) structure for this PBA. The proposed tetragonal structure satisfies observations, such as X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurements, that have been reported previously. A van der Waals corrected exchange-correlation functional is used in the DFT+U computations for an improved description of hydrogen bonding. The results provide strong support for a revised and simplified crystallographic description of Ni-3(2+)[Fe3+(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O, and show how H2O molecules stabilize the crystal structure and affect its magnetic and electronic properties. The symmetry lowering in nickel hexacyanoferrate is attributed to the hydration shell of the interstitial nickel cation. Calculations strongly suggest a maximum of n = 7 interstitial H2O molecules per formula unit for nickel hexacyanoferrate at room temperature, and a higher water content at temperatures below T similar or equal to 200 K. Since the symmetry lowering relies on the presence of interstitial H2O molecules, this revised crystallographic description may be applicable more generally to the large class of F (4) over bar 3m-structured PBAs.

TI Prussian blue coated with reduced graphene oxide as high-performance
   cathode for lithium-Sulfur batteries
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with their outstanding theoretical energy density are strongly considered to take over the post-lithium ion battery era; however, they are limited by sluggish reaction kinetics and the severe shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides. Prussian blue analogues (PBs) have demonstrated their efficiency in hindering the shuttle effects as host materials of sulfur; unfortunately, they show an inferior electronic conductivity, exhibiting considerable lifespan but poor rate performance. Herein, we rationally designed a PB@reduced graphene oxide as the host material for sulfur (S@PB@rGO) hybridsviaa facile liquid diffusion and physical absorption method, in which the sulfur was integrated into Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)] and rGO framework. When employed as a cathode, the as-prepared hybrid exhibited excellent rate ability (719 mA h g(-1)at 1C) and cycle stability (918 mA h g(-1)at 0.5C after 100 cycles). The improved electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergetic effect of PB and conductive rGO, which not only enhanced the physisorption of polysulfides but also provided a conductive skeleton to ensure rapid charge transfer kinetics, achieving high energy/power outputs and considerable lifespan simultaneously. This study may offer a new method manufacturing high performance Li-S batteries.

TI Paper-based Chemiluminescence Device with Co-Fe Nanocubes for Sensitive
   Detection of Caffeic Acid
SO ANALYTICAL SCIENCES
AB In this work, a new chemiluminescence (CL) system of Co-Fe prussian blue analogs nanocubes (Co-Fe PBA NCs) that can catalyze luminol to produce strong CL in the absence of H2O2 was established. Co-Fe PBA NCs have the property of oxidase-like activity, and it can catalyze the generation of active oxygen radicals in a dissolved oxygen system. Since caffeic acid (CA) can remove reactive oxygen species in the system, a sensitive detection method for CA on a paper-based chip was developed. Under the optimal conditions, this method showed a good linear response to CA in the range of 10 - 800 ng mL(-1) with a limit of 3 ng mL(-1). The proposed method had been used for the determination of CA in tea samples. The results may open a new avenue for the catalytic property on luminol CL system without extra oxidants.

Both samples show magnetocaloric effect (MCE) reaching the peak values of magnetic entropy change of 10 J.kg(-1)K(-1) for FeCr and 0.71 J.kg(-1)K(-1) for CrCr at mu 0 Delta H = 5 T, and 23 K and 218 K, respectively. The temperature averaged entropy change (TEC) was evaluated in the wide temperature range, resulting in TEC(3) = 9.9 J.kg(-1)K(-1) and TEC(20) = 8.7 J.kg(-1)K(-1) for FeCr, and TEC(3) = 0.71 J.kg(-1)K(-1) and TEC(20) = 0.67 J.kg(-1)K(-1) for CrCr. The magnetocaloric master curves indicate the second-order phase transition in FeCr and the presence of a complicated magnetically ordered phase of CrCr below the corresponding critical temperature.

TI In Situ FTIR-Assisted Synthesis of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Cathodes for
   Long-Life Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) with stable framework structures are ideal cathodes for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. The chelating agent-assisted coprecipitate method is an effective way to obtain low-defect PBAs that can limit the appearance of too many vacancies and water molecules and achieve an optimized Na-storage performance. However, for this method, the mechanism of chelating agent-assisted synthesis is still unclear. Herein, the synthesis process of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) has been investigated by in situ infrared spectroscopy detection. The results show that the chelating agent oxalate slows down the nucleation process and effectively inhibits the formation of the Fe-C  N-Ni frame in the aging process, producing highly crystallized and low-defect NiHCF samples. High quality NiHCF presents a high specific capacity of 86.3 mAh g(-1) (a theoretical value of similar to 85 mAh g(-1)), an ultrastable cyclic retention of 90% over 800 cycles, and a remarkable high capacity retention of 74.6% at a current density of 4250 mA g(-1) (50C). Particularly, the NiHCF//hard carbon full cell presents a high specific energy density of over 210 Wh kg(-1) and an outstanding cyclic stability without obvious capacity attenuation over 1000 cycles.

TI Preparation of double-yolk egg-like nanoreactor: Enhanced catalytic
   activity in Fenton-like reaction and insight on confinement effect
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based Fenton-like reaction is an effective technique for the pollutant degradation, and the Co-based metal organic frameworks displayed the excellent activity for the PMS activation. Nevertheless, how to further improve the catalytic activity, suppress the leaching of toxic cobalt ions, and realize the rapid separation were still challenges for practical application. In this work, a novel solution was proposed: encapsulating Fe3O4 and Prussian blue analogue (PBA) into the polypyrrole (PPy) shell and constructing a "double-yolk egg-like" Fe3O4/PBA@PPy as a nanoreactor. In Fe3O4/PBA@PPy-10, the catalytic performance was remarkably enhanced with the help of confinement effect, and the degradation rate (0.38 L center dot min center dot mol-1) was 5.1 times than that of reference Fe3O4/PBA-10 (0.074 L center dot min center dot mol-1). In addition, the concentration of leached cobalt ions was reduced to only 0.174 mg/L by the protective function from the PPy shell. Moreover, the nanoreactor could be magnetically separated from the reaction solution due to the encapsulation of Fe3O4 nanospheres, and 84.5% of activity still preserved after the 4th cycle. The main active species involved in Fe3O4/PBA@PPy-10 system was 1O2, while that in reference Fe3O4/ PBA-10 system was center dot OH. Electron spin resonance analysis and radical trapping experiment revealed that the different catalytic mechanisms were attributed to the confinement effect inside the hollow cavity. This work not only presents a feasible way to prepare rarely-reported double-yolk egg-like nanoreactor, but also provides a new insight to solve the bottlenecks in Fenton-like reaction.

   sub>O (M = Fe, Co)
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANORGANISCHE UND ALLGEMEINE CHEMIE
AB In porous Prussian blue (PB) analogues, the partially naked central metal atoms found at the cavities surface are responsible for many of their physical properties, among them the adsorption potentials. In the as-synthesized PB analogues, such metal sites stabilize water molecules inside the cavity through coordination bond formation. The filling of the cavity volume is completed with water molecules linked to the coordinated ones through hydrogen bonds formation. Vanadyl-based PB analogue shows quite different features. The metal(V) at the cavities surface has saturated its coordination sphere with the O atom of the vanadyl ion (V=O). In this material, the V=O group preserves enough strong dipole moment to stabilize adsorbed species at the cavity through dipole-dipole and dipole-quadrupole interactions. This contribution reports the preparation, crystal structure and properties for (VO)(3)[M(CN)(6)](2)nH(2)O (M = Fe, Co). According to the refined crystal structure, IR spectra and TG data, six water molecules remain stabilized inside the cavities through a strong dipole-dipole coupling with the vanadyl group. The cavity contains additional water molecules interacting through hydrogen bond bridges with the water molecules coupled to the V=O group. The vanadyl ion is free of hydrogen bonding interactions with the water molecules. The recorded adsorption isotherms for N-2, CO2 and H-2, three molecules with only quadrupole moment, reveal presence of relative strong adsorption forces due to dipole-quadrupole interactions.

TI An ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence sensor based on luminol
   functionalized AuNPs@Fe-Co-Co nanocomposite as signal probe for
   glutathione determination
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In this work, the FeyCo3-y [Co (CN)(6)](2) Prussian blue analogues (Fe-Co-Co PBAs) was first used as the regenerable co-reaction accelerator in luminol-O-2 system to accelerate the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction rate of luminol and the co-reactant of O-2 for signal amplification. Remarkably, the ECL intensity of luminol functionalized AuNPs@Fe-Co-Co (luminol-AuNPs@Fe-Co-Co) nanocomposite first synthesized as an ECL probe via a green and simple method exhibited similar to 41-fold enhancement compared with luminol-AuNPs. Because the Fe-Co-Co PBAs with excellent reversible redox property could accelerate the reduction of dissolved O-2 to generate plenty of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) for promoting luminol to emit a strong Ea, signal. In addition, Fe-Co-Co PBAs acted as a satisfying nanocarrier to immobilize more luminol-AuNPs. Owing to the strong quenching effect of glutathione (GSM) on the ECL emission of luminol, the constructed ECL sensor for the quantitative analysis of GSH performed an excellent linearity from 1.0 nM to 1.0 mM with a low detection limit of 0.11 nM. Simultaneously, the proposed sensor applied for GSH determination in human serum samples with desirable results. This work introduced a robust co-reaction accelerator into luminol-O-2 system to enhance the ECL intensity, further widening the application of luminol-centric ECL sensor in the bioanalysis field.

TI Copper hexacyanoferrate/carbon sheet combination with high selectivity
   and capacity for copper removal by pseudocapacitance
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The efficient capture of copper ions (Cu2+) in wastewater has dual significance in pollution control and resource recovery. Prussian blue analog (PBA)-based pseudocapacitive materials with open frameworks and abundant metal sites have attracted considerable attention as capacitive deionization (CDI) electrodes for copper removal. In this study, the efficiency of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) as CDI electrode for Cu2+ treating was evaluated for the first time upon the successful synthesis of copper hexacyanoferrate/carbon sheet combination (CuHCF/C) by introducing carbon sheet as conductive substrate. CuHCF/C exhibited significant pseudocapacitance and high specific capacitance (52.92 F g-1) through the intercalation, deintercalation, and coupling of Cu+/Cu2+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs. At 0.8 an applied voltage and CuSO4 feed liquid concentration of 100 mg L-1, the salt adsorption capacity was 134.47 mg g-1 higher than those of most reported electrodes. Moreover, CuHCF/C demonstrated excellent Cu2+ selectivity in multi -ion coexisting solutions and in actual wastewater experiments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanism. This study not only reveals the essence of Cu2+ deionization by PBAs pseudocapacitance with promising potential applications but also provides a new strategy for selecting efficient CDI electrodes for Cu2+ removal.

TI KCoxMn1-x[Fe(CN)6]/Carbon nanotube
   composite as high capacity anode for Li-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB To explore inexpensive electrode materials with high energy density is urgent for developing next generation Li-ion batteries (LIBs). In this paper, a multi-metal Prussian blue analogue composited with carbon nanotube (KCoxMn1-x[Fe(CN)6]/CNT), synthesized via a simple solution precipitation method, is employed as the anode for LIBs, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance. When cycled at 0.1 A g?1, it delivers the reversible capacity up to 727.5 mA h g?1 during initial de-lithiation. In addition, this material presents excellent rate capability, yielding 452.3 and 408.7 mA h g?1 at 1 and 2 A g?1, respectively. The improved performance may be associated with the effective connection between CNT and CoMnHCF particles to enhance the charge-transfer kinetics and lower the electrical resistance. Regarding the charge/discharge mechanism, the full reduction of Co2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ in the initial lithiation process and the redox of Fe2O3/Fe0, CoO/Co0, MnO/Mn0 in the subsequent cycles is proposed.

TI Bimetal-bridging Nitrogen Coordination in Carbon-based Electrocatalysts
   for pH-universal Oxygen Reduction
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed metal sites (e.g., metal-nitrogen-carbon) have been deemed as promising alternatives for noble-metal catalysts in couples of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the modulation of such atomic sites and the understanding of their interactions are still highly challenging. Herein, we propose a unique supermolecule assembly-profile coating strategy to prepare a series of diatomic electrocatalysts by profile coating of eight Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on supramolecular supports respectively as bimetallic sources. The detailed microstructure analysis revealed that the metal-nitrogen-carbon sites with four- (Zn-N4) and five-coordination (Fe-N5) via the nitrogen coordination are similar to the cytochrome c oxidases. For promising electrocatalysis, such unique microstructure is able to activate oxygen molecules due to nitrogen-bonding coordination with bimetal sites, thus leading to efficient four-electron oxygen reduction in alkaline, neutral, and acid electrolytes. Especially, zinc group elements (e.g., Zn and Cd) with d10 electron configuration would significantly boost the nitrogen-bonding coordination with bimetal sites to enhance electrocatalytic activity. The proof-of-concept for the general synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with controllable bimetal active sites and the mechanistic understanding will promote the promising electrocatalysis by applying the similar principles.

SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Electrochemical methods are promising technical routes for future clean energy storage and conversion. Most of the electrochemical methods involve oxygen reactions. Unfavorable kinetics and sluggish reactions are the main challenges for these processes. We report here a facile synthesis of highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. The catalysts are synthesized through the fine-tuning of metal ions (M, specifically Co, Ni, Zn, and Cu) in Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and thus termed as M-PBAs. The CoNi-PBA-2 catalyst shows the highest activity toward OER with an onset potential at 280 mV and a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1). Zn-PBA catalysts demonstrate high selectivity in two-electron-transfer ORR The H2O2 yield is as high as 88% at 0 V vs RHE. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also confirm the high selectivity of Zn-PBA toward H2O2 in ORR.

TI Zn-Ion Batteries: Boosting the Rate Capability and Low-temperature
   Performance by Combining Structure and Morphology Engineering
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been considered as one kind of the most promising cathode materials for Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their low cost, high performance, high safety, and high abundance. However, owing to the low conductivity and single electron reaction, it is a great challenge to obtain a PBA cathode material with high reversible capacity, high rate capability, and good temperature adaptability. Here, a cathode material, K-1.14(VO)(3.33)[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot 6.8H(2)O (KVHCF), with a multielectron reaction and double conductive carbon framework (DCCF) is designed and synthesized by combining structure and morphology engineering. With the multielectron reaction and high electronic conductivity simultaneously, the KVHCF@DCCF cathode material delivers a high specific capacity (180 mAh.g(-1) @ 400 mA.g(-1)) and the best rate performance (116 mAhg(-1) @ 8000 mA.g(-1)) of the reported PBAs. Moreover, KVHCF@DCCF presents a high specific capacity of 132 mAh.g(-1) @ 400 mA.g(-1) at 0 degrees C. Even at -10 degrees C, it still delivers specific capacities of 127 mAh.g(-1) @ 40 mA.g(-1) and 80 mAh.g(-1) @ 400 mA.g(-1) with a retention of 86% after 700 cycles. In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are carried out to investigate the charge-discharge electrochemical reaction mechanism.

TI Integrating built-in fine alloying FeNi3 in carbon nanofiber reinforcing
   intermetallic synergy for PMS activation to degrade Bisphenol A
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Heterogeneous peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for the mineralization of pollutants has attracted growing attention, while alloying bimetal catalysts afford big promises in synergetic catalysis. Here, by an alteration of electrospun precursor, one-dimensional carbon nanofiber (CNF) integrated with Prussian blue analogs (PBA)-derived alloyed fine plasmonic FeNi3 hybrid catalyst (FeNi3@CNF) was constructed by electrospinning technique with subsequent confinement calcination. The amount of PBA in fiber precursor and thermal treatment tem-perature were alternatively adjusted to control the distribution and concentration of alloyed FeNi3 in carbon nanofiber. This unique structure combines the advantages of abundant internal porosity of N-doping carbon fiber and uniforms active FeNi3 alloys with highly-exposed reactive sites, facilitating the electron transport and proximity of reactant molecules in catalytic oxidation. The synergistic and interfacial effect of optimal FeNi3@CNF endowed the ultra-fast degradation activity against bisphenol A (BPA) through rapid persulphate activation to generate four reactive active species. Specifically, 20 mg L-1 of BPA was completely degraded within 4 min with a reaction rate constant of 2.736 min-1. Impressively, by innovating the utilization of the Prussian blue precursor in electrospinning, the optimal FeNi3@CNF shows 18.5, 101.3, and 248.5 times activity enhancement in BPA degradation compared to that of Fe@CNF, Ni@CNF, and Fe & Ni@CNF, revealing the appreciable synergy of bimetallic alloys in PMS activation. In addition, the improved catalytic performance of FeNi3@CNF under light irradiation was also simulated, confirming that the enhanced photothermal conversion ability of plasmonic alloys and carbon fiber advance the degradation of BPA.

AB In this study, a nanoparticulated synthesis based surface modification was applied to a Prussian blue analogue (PBA), ruthenium purple (Fe-4[Ru(CN)(6)](3), RP). The RP nanoparticles (nRP) with significantly enhanced electrical and ionic conductivities were compared to their micro-scale counterpart (mRP). By reducing the kinetic barriers during electrochemical cycling, nRP showed pronounced enhancement in the optical properties including higher transmittance change (Delta T), shorter response time, faster redox kinetics, and better cycling stability. A novel complementary electrochromic device (ECD) was proposed to utilize nRP as the anodically coloring material and Fe(II)-based metallo-supramolecular polymer (Fe(II)-MEPE) as the cathodically coloring material. Both anodically and cathodically coloring materials exhibited maximum optical modulation around 550 nm, which is the most sensitive light spectrum to human eyes in the visible region. Upon applying potential biases between 0.3 and 1.3 V to the Fe(II)-MEPE/nRP ECD, a large transmittance change of 50.7% at 580 nm, fast response times of 0.4 s both in coloring/bleaching, and a high coloration efficiency of 512.5 cm(2)/C at 580 nm were observed. At the same operation condition, the proposed ECD retained 96.4% of its initial AT after 10,000 cycles of continuous switching.

TI Bimetallic Cu-Zn Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles for enhanced
   oxygen evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The quest for sustainable energy sources has led to the exploration of efficient electrochemical water splitting technologies. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a crucial process in water splitting, plays a pivotal role in the production of clean hydrogen fuel. Recently, metal hexacyanocobaltate (MHCCs) have garnered attention as OER catalysts because of their distinctive open structure, which allows for the customization of their electronic and catalytic features. Nonetheless, single-metal MHCCs, such as CuHCC and ZnHCC, have inherent shortcomings such as low stability under harsh alkaline conditions, low conductivity, and high OER overpotential, which limit their OER applications. To address these drawbacks, the synthesis and utilization of bimetallic Cu-Zn hexacyanocobaltate nanoparticles have emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing OER efficiency. The incorporation of both elements results in a catalyst with enhanced electrocatalytic activity, improved stability, and optimized OER kinetics compared to those of their individual counterparts. In this study, bimetallic Cu-Zn hexacyanocobaltate (CuxZn3-xHCC) nanoparticles with different Cu to Zn ratios were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal process, and their OER catalytic activity was studied. The CuxZn3-xHCC nanoparticles exhibited a lower OER overpotential and long-term OER activity with minimal changes in overpotential. Moreover, the graphite||CuxZn3-xHCC couple requires a cell voltage of only 1.831 V to drive the alkali-electrolyser at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), proving practical application of the synthesized bimetallic MHCC in the energy conversion field.

TI Photoswitchable 11 nm CsCoFe Prussian Blue Analogue Nanocrystals with
   High Relaxation Temperature
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Photoswitchable 11 nm nanocrystals with the coordination network Cs{Co-[Fe(CN)(6)]} were obtained using a template-free method. The nanocrystals were recovered from the colloidal solutions as solid materials surrounded by cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA) cations or embedded in the organic polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Complementary magnetic, spectroscopic, and structural techniques, including EPR spectroscopy, reveal a majority (similar to 70%) of the low-spin and photoactive diamagnetic (CoFeII)-Fe-II pairs located in the core of the nanocrystals and a mixture of CoIIFeII and CoIIFeIII species present mainly within the shell of the objects. While bulk compounds with similar vacancy concentration do not exhibit noticeable photoinduced charge transfer, the observed photoactivity of the nanocrystals is ascribed to their nanometric size. The relaxation temperature of the photoinduced state shifts upward by similar to 55 K when PVP is replaced by CTA. This is ascribed to the larger rigidity of the dense CsCoFe_CTA material, whose metastable state is lower than that for CsCoFe_PVP, leading to a larger relaxation energy barrier and, therefore, to a higher relaxation temperature.

TI Enhanced electrochemical performance of Prussian blue analogues combined
   with 2D black phosphorus
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The design and tailoring of the cathode material for a supercapacitor are of enormous importance in achieving its high performance. A composite cathode material, composed of 2D BP coated on a 3D CoPBA, has been systematically developed and created through self-assembly using electrostatic adsorption. The structure and components of the CoPBA/BP composites were studied and analyzed using XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM. The 2D BP wrappers can serve as conductive additives, facilitating charge transport and enhancing the electrochemical performance. The morphologies and electrochemical performances of CoPBA/BP were systematically investigated with increasing BP content. CoPBA-6BP is found to have a maximum specific capacitance of 755F/g at 1 A/ g, which is 2.6 times greater than pure CoPBA. This makes the 2D/3D structured composite a strong candidate for cathode material applications.

SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB In order to meet the growing demand of energy storage for the power grid, aqueous NH4+ batteries are attracting increasing attention as a promising alternative due to their environmental significance, abundant resources, and fast diffusion ability. In this work, FeFe(CN)(6) (FeHCF) is synthesized as a cathode material for aqueous NH4+ batteries and Fe-2(SO4)(3) is utilized as a kind of functional additive in the electrolyte based on the "common ion effect" to enhance its electrochemical performance. The results indicate that the initial capacity of FeHCF is about 80 mA h g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency of 97.8%. The retention rate can attain 96.3% within nearly 1000 cycles. Multivariate analysis methods are carried out to characterize the mechanism of FeHCF in aqueous NH4+ batteries. From the practical standpoint, FeHCF has outstanding cycling stability and rate capability, making it feasible to be applied in the power grid.

TI Fabrication of 2D/3D hierarchical PBA and derivative electrocatalysts
   for overall water splitting
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Assembling a hierarchical well-defined Prussian blue analogues (PBA) construction is a useful way to take earth-abundant elements into application toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a unique strategy for in-situ grafting three-dimensional (3D) MnFe-PBA cubes on the top of two-dimensional (2D) MnO2 nanosheet arrays (PBA@MnO2) via a facile two-step hydrothermal method with the participation of Ni foam (NF). After experiencing low-temperature pyrolysis in NH3/Ar atmosphere, the above catalysts are transformed into metal-nitride derivatives (N-FeMnNi). Remarkably, when operated in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, the as-obtained PBA@MnO2-150/30 (where 150 and 30 represent the hydrothermal temperature (degrees C) and the concentration of K3Fe(CN) 6 (mM) for preparation, respectively) shows the most outstanding OER activity, with an overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, N-FeMnNi-130/10 requires an overpotential of 101 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for HER. As a result, the two samples are organized to establish a two-electrode cell, with a voltage of only 1.60 V needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, it can stably work for 30 h without obvious current attenuation. This work provides a brand new perspective for the design of PBA electrocatalysts towards high-efficiency overall water splitting.

TI Immunotherapy of M2 macrophage derived from exosome-based nanoparticles

SO INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Developing biomimetic nanoparticles without off-target side-effects remains a major challenge in spinal cord injury (SCI) immunotherapy. In this paper, we have conducted a drug carrier which is biocompatible macrophages-exocytosed exosome-biomimetic manganese (Mn)-iron prussian blue analogues (MPBs) for SCI immunotherapy. Exosome-sheathed MPBs (E-MPBs) exhibit promoted microglia accumulation, alleviation from H2O2-induced microenvironment and inhibition of apoptosis and inflammation in vitro. In addition, E-MPBs possessed significant tissue repair and neuroprotection in vivo. These properties endowed E-MPBs with great improvement in vivo in function recovery, resulting in anti-neuroinflammation activity and excellent biocompatibility in mice SCI model. As a promising treatment for efficient SCI immunotherapy, these results demonstrate the use of exosome-sheathed biomimetic nanoparticles exocytosed by anti-inflammation cells is feasible.

TI Water-in-Salt Electrolyte Promotes High-Capacity FeFe(CN)6
   Cathode for Aqueous Al-Ion Battery
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are considered to be ideal multivalent cation host materials due to their unique open-framework structure. In aqueous solution, however, the PBAs' cathodes have a low reversible capacity limited by the single electrochemical group Fe(CN)(6)(3-) and high crystal water content. They also suffer from fast cycle fading, resulting from significant oxygen/hydrogen evolution and cathode dissolution. In this work, a high-capacity PBA-type FeFe(CN)(6) cathode with double transition metal redox sites is successfully demonstrated in 5 m Al(CF3SO3)(3) Water in-Salt electrolyte (Al-WISE). Due to Al-WISE having a wide electrochemical window (2.65 V) and low dissolution of the cathode, our PBA cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 116 mAh/g and the superior cycle stability >100 cycles with capacity fading of 0.39% per cycle.

TI Structural reorganization of CuO/Cu2[Fe(CN)6]
   nanocomposite: characterization and electrocatalytic effect for the
   hydrogen peroxide reduction
SO ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB We report the study on the formation of the Cu-2[Fe(CN)(6)] nanocomposite, which was obtained from copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and Prussian Blue precursors. UV-vis analysis indicated that Cu2+ ions are released from CuO NPs, while Fe3+ ions are adsorbed onto the structure of CuO due to a sharp increase in zeta potential (from -30 to 0 mV) after the formation of the Cu-2[Fe(CN)(6)]. Moreover, energy dispersive spectroscopy confirmed that Fe3+ ions are trapped in the CuO NPs structure. The CuO/Cu-2[Fe(CN)(6)] nanocomposite exhibited the monoclinic and face-centered cubic phases that correspond to the CuO and Cu-2[Fe(CN)(6)] components. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the Nanocomposite modified electrode revealed two well-defined redox couples at -0.073 ((E-1/2)(1)) and 0.665 mV ((E-1/2)(2)), attributed to the conversion of Cu2+ to Cu+ and CuFe2, CuFe3, pairs, respectively, which is similar to those in the CuO and Cu-2[Fe(CN)(6)] components. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the nanocomposite towards hydrogen was investigated through CV, where the reduction of H2O2 led to increased currents for the electrochemical process associated with the first redox pair. In contrast, for isolated materials (CuO NPs and Cu-2[Fe(CN)(6)]), there was no significant increase in the current associated with either redox pair.

Investigation of the ferroelectricity of film 1 at different temperatures reveals that it exhibits ferroelectric behaviour in the temperature range from 10 K to 310 K. Study of the X-ray absorption (XAS) of the crushed film 1 and simulation of the structure of film 1 and crushed film 1 by using the Materials Studio software indicate that the vacancy defects and interactions between the film and FTO substrate make a key contribution to the ferroelectricity of film 1. Owing to the magnetic phase transition point being up to 210 K, film 1 is a multiferroic material and its magneto/electric coexistence temperature can be as high as 210 K.

TI Solid electrochemical energy storage for aqueous redox flow batteries:
   The case of copper hexacyanoferrate
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB All redox flow batteries suffer from low energy storage density in comparison with conventional Li-ion batteries. However, this issue can be mitigated by utilization of solid energy storage materials to enhance the energy storage capacity. In this paper we demonstrate the utilization of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) Prussian blue analogue for this purpose, coupled with N,N,N-2,2,6,6-heptamethylpiperidinyl oxy-4-ammonium chloride (TEMPTMA) as a soluble redox mediator to target the redox transitions of the solid material. In this case, indirect charging and discharging of CuHCF suspended in the electrolyte by electrochemically oxidized/reduced TEMPTMA was observed by chronoamperometry. Secondly, electrochemistry of different CuHCF composites with carbon black and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were investigated, highlighting that the high conductivity of the solid energy storage materials is crucial to access the maximal charge storage capacity. Finally, a CuHCF-TEMPTMA/Zn aqueous redox flow battery achieved stable cycling performances with high coulombic efficiency of 95% and volumetric capacity of 350 C mL(-1). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI CoCo-PBA/tetrabutylammonium bromide as highly efficient catalyst for
   CO2 and epoxides coupling reaction under mild conditions
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB The development of effective and low-energy-consumption catalysts for CO2 conversion into high-value-added products by constructing versatile active sites on the surface of heterogeneous compounds is an urgent and challenging task. In this study, a stable and well-defined heterogeneous cobalt hexacyanocobaltate (Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)), typical cobalt Prussian blue analogue (CoCo-PBA) modified with tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB), is proven to be the superior catalyst for CO2 and epoxide coupling to produce cyclic carbonates with > 99% yield under mild reaction conditions (1.0 MPa, 65 degrees C). Based on a series of characterizations, it is revealed that the CoCo-PBA structure can maintain relatively high thermal and chemical stability. Recycling experiments exhibited that the CoCo-PBA system could retain 98% of the original activity after six reaction rounds. The CoCo-PBA/TBAB catalytic system was also highly active for coupling CO2 with other industrial-grade epoxides. These results show the CoCo-PBA catalytic system potential flexibility and the generality of the catalyst preparation strategy.

TI Vanadium Ferrocyanides as a Highly Stable Cathode for Lithium-Ion
   Batteries
SO MOLECULES
AB Owing to their high redox potential and availability of numerous diffusion channels in metal-organic frameworks, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are attractive for metal ion storage applications. Recently, vanadium ferrocyanides (VFCN) have received a great deal of attention for application in sodium-ion batteries, as they demonstrate a stable capacity with high redox potential of similar to 3.3 V vs. Na/Na+. Nevertheless, there have been no reports on the application of VFCN in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, a facile synthesis of VFCN was performed using a simple solvothermal method under ambient air conditions through the redox reaction of VCl3 with K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]. VFCN exhibited a high redox potential of similar to 3.7 V vs. Li/Li+ and a reversible capacity of similar to 50 mAh g(-1). The differential capacity plots revealed changes in the electrochemical properties of VFCN after 50 cycles, in which the low spin of Fe ions was partially converted to high spin. Ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the unchanged VFCN structure during cycling. This demonstrated the high structural stability of VFCN. The low cost of precursors, simplicity of the process, high stability, and reversibility of VFCN suggest that it can be a candidate for large-scale production of cathode materials for LIBs.

TI Prussian Blue@C Composite as an Ultrahigh-Rate and Long-Life Sodium-Ion
   Battery Cathode
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Rechargeable sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are surfacing as promising candidates for applications in large-scale energy-storage systems. Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have been considered as potential cathodes because of their rigid open framework and low-cost synthesis. Nevertheless, PBAs suffer from inferior rate capability and poor cycling stability resulting from the low electronic conductivity and deficiencies in the PBAs framework. Herein, to understand the vacancy-impacted sodium storage and Na-insertion reaction kinetics, we report on an in-situ synthesized PB@C composite as a high-performance SIB cathode. Perfectly shaped, nanosized PB cubes were grown directly on carbon chains, assuring fast charge transfer and Na-ion diffusion. The existence of [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies in the PB crystal is found to greatly degrade the electrochemical activity of the Fe-LS(C) redox couple via first-principles computation. Superior reaction kinetics are demonstrated for the redox reactions of the Fe-HS(N) couple, which rely on the partial insertion of Na ions to enhance the electron conduction. The synergistic effects of the structure and morphology results in the PB@C composite achieving an unprecedented rate capability and outstanding cycling stability (77.5 mAh g(-1) at 90 C, 90 mAh g(-1) after 2000 cycles at 20 C with 90% capacity retention).

TI Functional alkoxysilane mediated controlled synthesis of Prussian blue
   nanoparticles, enabling silica alginate bead development; nanomaterial
   for selective electrochemical sensing
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB We report herein the controlled synthetic strategy for Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) formation justifying the role of functional alkoxysilanes, [2-(3,4-Epoxycyclohexyl)ethyl]trimethoxysilane (EETMSi) in the presence of tetrahydrofuran hydroperoxide (THF-HPO) with following major findings: (i) significant change in nanogeometry from 40 to 8 nm by addition of EETMSi and (ii) allowed fabrication of PBNPs encapsulated silica-alginate beads. As made nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, TEM, FT-IR, and SEM. Size dependent electrochemical behavior of three different PBNPs i.e. PBNPs-1 (26 nm), PBNPs-2 (17 nm) and PBNPs-3 (8 nm) was recorded based on cyclic voltammetry. Apart from unprecedented size-dependent properties, as made PBNPs-3 display excellent peroxidase mimetic activity with Km value to the order of similar to 0.9 mM. In addition, EETMSi also allows to cast Prussian blue film and simultaneously enable the formation of silica-alginate beads with controlled pores size perfectly suitable for encapsulating these nanoparticles which allocate selective electrochemical oxidation of Pyrogallol (Py) at 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl.

TI Copper Hexacyanoferrate as a Novel Electrode Material in Electrochemical
   Detection of Cumene Hydroperoxide
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) is an important initiator in polymerization industry. The compound is potentially explosive, toxic, and mutagenic. Herein, an electrochemical sensor is developed for CHP detection. First, the mechanism of CHP electrode process was investigated by a combination of electrochemical methods and ex-situ characterization techniques (SEM, FTIR, LC-MS, H-1-NMR, and C-13-NMR). The electrochemically generated species became more easily reduced than CHP and deposited on the electrode surface, allowing the analyte to be detected at low overpotential in aqueous solutions (as opposed to organic solvents typically needed in organic peroxide detection). In addition to the newly developed method, the performance of the electrochemical sensor was further enhanced via the use of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF), a Prussian blue analogue which showed strong electrocatalytic activity towards peroxide reduction. A number of different CuHCF samples were synthesized and tested. The crystalline nanostructured CuHCF with high surface area (31.92 m(2) g(-1)) and large lattice parameter (10.1397(1) angstrom) yielded excellent analytical performance towards CHP detection. The optimized method showed high tolerance to interferences and was validated in tap water samples. The excellent reproducibility (%RSD = 1.81, n = 3), high sensitivity (44.03 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1)), and low detection limit (5.9 mu M, 3S (b)/m) of the developed CHP sensor were demonstrated.

TI Modulating CoFe2O4 nanocube with oxygen vacancy
   and carbon wrapper towards enhanced electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction
   to ammonia
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction is increasingly deemed as a promising route for massive ammonia synthesis. Herein, hollow bimetallic CoFe2O4 nanocube derived from prussian blue analogue is elaborately wrapped by thin carbon layer and modified by rich oxygen vacancies, achieving splendid ammonia yield rate of 30.97 mu g h-1 mgcat.- 1 and Faradaic efficiency of 11.65 % at -0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4. In addition, C@CoFe2O4-x nanocube can withstand long-term and repetitive electrolysis without obvious structure collapse, constituent change and activity decay. The prominent activity is strongly associated with improved nitrogen adsorption and activation, collaboratively benefiting from the intrinsic unoccupied d orbitals of transition metal components, reformative electronic structure by oxygen vacancies and elevated electron injection possibility into the antibonding orbital of nitrogen molecule via conductive carbon wrapper. Both actual experiments and theoretical investigations attest the catalytic activity improvement mechanism, rendering the C@CoFe2O4-x nanocube design strategy efficient and valid.

TI A rational study of the influence of Mn<SUP>2+</SUP>-insertion in
   Prussian blue nanoparticles on their photothermal properties
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
AB We investigated a series of Mn2+-Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles NazMnxFe1-x[Fe(CN)(6)](1-yy)center dot nH(2)O of similar size, surface state and cubic morphology with various amounts of Mn2+ synthesized through a one step self-assembly reaction. We demonstrated by a combined experimental-theoretical approach that during the synthesis, Mn2+ substituted Fe3+ up to a Mn/Na-Mn-Fe ratio of 32 at% in the PB structure, while for higher amounts, the Mn-2[Fe(CN)(6)] analogue is obtained. For comparison, the post-synthetic insertion of Mn2+ in PB nanoparticles was also investigated and completed with Monte-Carlo simulations to probe the plausible adsorption sites. The photothermal conversion efficiency (eta) of selected samples was determined and showed a clear dependence on the Mn(2+)amount with a maximum efficiency for a Mn/Na-Mn-Fe ratio of 10 at% associated with a dependence on the nanoparticle concentration. Evaluation of the in vitro photothermal properties of these nanoparticles performed on triple negative human breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cells by using continuous and pulsed laser irradiation confirm their excellent PTT efficiency permitting low dose use.

TI Microstructure collapse: A shortcut to skip lengthy cyclic voltammetric
   activation in oxygen evolution reaction
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB This work outlines a simple yet ingenious approach to enhance performance of catalysts and stabilization in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by rapidly disrupting microstructure. Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanospheres (NS), designed as advanced electrocatalysts, are based on Ni3S2@FeCoNi and phosphorization. Thermal oxidation can allow NS to undergo microstructural collapse and form nanorubble (NR). NR obtained at 325 degrees C has a lower overpotential (230.0 mV) than NS. The material reaches its optimum condition directly, skipping tedious cyclic voltammetric (CV) activation. Collapse has regular properties, which are evidenced in some materials. No significant performance degradation during 1000 h (j = 10 mA cm(-2)) and 24 h (j = 500 mA cm(-2)) of electrolysis confirms excellence of this unconventional pathway. Theoretical calculations show the exposure of amorphous state from collapse enriches charges on the material surface, which helps to promote transformation of intermediates at the catalytic microinterfaces and accelerates the reaction process.

TI One-step synthesis of novel core-shell bimetallic hexacyanoferrate for
   high performance sodium-storage cathode
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Recently, the design of core-shell hierarchical architecture plays an important role in improving the electrochemical performance of Prussian blue analogue cathodes (PBAs). Unfortunately, the inconvenient stepwise preparation and the strict lattice-matching requirement have restricted the development of coreshell PBAs. Herein, we demonstrate a one-step synthesis strategy to synthesize core-shell manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnFeHCF@MnFeHCF) for the first time. And the formation mechanism of the core-shell hierarchical architecture is investigated by first-principles calculations. It is found that the as-obtained MnFeHCF@MnFeHCF act out the superior intrinsic natures, which not only can obtain a larger specific surface area and lower Fe(CN) 6 vacancies but also can activate more Na-storage sites. Compared with the manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF), the iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF), and even the traditional coreshell nickel hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF@NiHCF) prepared by a stepwise method, the MnFeHCF@MnFeHCF demonstrates a superior rate performance, which achieves a high capacity of 131 mAh g -1 at 50 mA g -1 and delivers a considerable discharge capacity of about 100 mAh g -1 even at 1600 mA g -1 . Meantime, the capacity retention can reach up to nearly 80% after 500 cycles. The improved performances could be mainly originated from two aspects: on the one hand, Mn substitution is helpful to enhance the material conductivity; on the other hand, the core-shell structure with matched lattice parameters is more favorable to enhance the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions. Beside, the structural transformation of MnFeHCF@MnFeHCF upon the extraction/insertion of sodium ions is instrumental in releasing the interior stress and effectively maintaining the integrity of the crystal structure.

TI Electrocatalytic cleavage of a lignin β-O-4 model compound and coupling
   with nitrogen-containing aromatics using Prussian blue analogue-derived
   nickel-cobalt spinel
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Electrochemical conversion of lignin for the production of high-value heterocyclic aromatic compounds has great potential. We demonstrate the targeted synthesis and cation modulation of NiCo2O4 spinel nanoboxes, synthesized via cation exchange and calcination oxidation. These catalysts exhibit excellent efficacy in the electrocatalytic conversion of lignin model compounds, specifically 2-phenoxy-1phenylethanol, into nitrogen-containing aromatics, achieving high conversion rates and selectivities. These catalysts were synthesized via a cation exchange and calcination oxidation process, using Prussian blue nanocubes as precursors. The porous architecture and polymetallic composition of the NiCo2O4 spinel demonstrated superior performance in electrocatalytic oxidative coupling, achieving a 99.2 wt% conversion rate of the 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol with selectivities of 37.5 wt% for quinoline derivatives and 31.5 wt% for phenol. Key innovations include the development of a sustainable one-pot synthesis method for quinoline derivatives, the elucidation of a multistage reaction pathway involving C-O bond cleavage, hydroxyaldol condensation, and C-N bond formation, and a deeper mechanistic understanding derived from DFT simulations. This work establishes a new strategy for lignin valorization, offering a sustainable route to produce high-value nitrogen-containing aromatics from renewable biomass under mild conditions, without the need for additional reagents.

TI Prussian blue analogue derived porous hollow nanocages comprising
   polydopamine-derived N-doped C coated CoSe2/FeSe2
   nanoparticles composited with N-doped graphitic C as an anode for
   high-rate Na-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB CoFe-Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) templated N-doped graphitic carbon (NGC) and polydopamine-derived carbon (PDA-20) double-coated CoSe2/FeSe2 nanoparticles are introduced as anodes for highly efficient sodiumion batteries (SIBs). These nanoparticles are encapsulated within porous hollow nanocages, which exhibit remarkable stability in cyclic performance. The synthesis method involved co-precipitation, followed by PDA coating at varying concentrations and a subsequent selenization process. This resulted in the creation of (Co,Fe) Se-NGC nanocages, (Co,Fe)Se-NGC@PDA-20 hollow nanocages, and (Co,Fe)Se-NGC@PDA-100 filled nanocages. This strategic preparation approach leverages the synergistic effects of dual carbon coating, resulting in highly conductive and porous nanostructures. These structures facilitate rapid charge species diffusion, efficient electrolyte infiltration, and effective management of volumetric changes. When used as anodes for SIBs, the (Co,Fe) Se-NGC@PDA-20 hollow nanocages demonstrate impressive structural robustness and high-rate performance. They exhibit remarkable structural integrity, maintaining stable cycling performance for up to 200 cycles at 0.5 and 1.0 A g-1. In terms of rate capability, the hollow nanocages exhibit a high discharge capacity of 126 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1. This clearly highlights the structural advantages of the prepared hollow nanocages.

TI Structural Features of Porous CoFe Nanocubes and Their Performance for
   Oxygen-involving Energy Electrocatalysis
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB The structural properties of CoFe composites fabricated from inexpensive Co(II) and Fe(III) precursors using a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) strategy without additional reductants were investigated. Microporous CoFe-200 and microporous/mesoporous CoFe-550 structures of the CoFe catalysts (CoFe-PBA) were produced by calcination for 1 h in N(2)at 200 degrees C or 550 degrees C, respectively. The electrocatalytic activities of the CoFe catalysts produced for the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR) were studied in alkaline media. The OER measurements revealed the CoFe-200 catalyst to be superior to CoFe-PBA and CoFe-550, and even surpass the activity of commercial Ir/C in terms of the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)and onset potential (EonsetOER). On the other hand, the ORR activity of CoFe-550 exhibited a more positive half-wave potential (0.837 V vs. RHE) andEonsetORR(0.942 V vs. RHE) than CoFe-200. The Tafel slope (-55.9 mV dec(-1)) of CoFe-550 was lower than that of Pt/C (-77.8 mV dec(-1)). A comparison of CoFe-200 and CoFe-550 suggested that the microporosity of CoFe-200 (average pore diameter,d <= 2 nm) was beneficial in terms of the OER. In contrast, the mesoporous (d approximate to 35.6 nm) structure of CoFe-550 promoted the mass-transport kinetics of oxygen through the electrode surface. CoFe nanocubes with tunable porosity are potential catalysts that can be utilized selectively for the OER and ORR.

TI Surface-Like Diffusion of Fast Ions in Framework Energy Materials for
   Li- and Na-Ion Batteries
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB The rate performance, power density, and energy efficiency of electrochemical devices are often limited by ionic conductivities in electrolyte and electrode materials. Framework Prussian blue analogs and dense niobium oxides have been identified as high-rate electrodes for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries, respectively, yet the origin of the extremely high solid-state Na+/Li+ transport is not fully understood. Of critical importance is the fact that their ultra-low activation energy and anomalous pre-exponent factor cannot be satisfactorily rationalized from conventional theory of solid-state diffusion in the crystal lattice. Here, assisted by density-functional-theory calculations, we argued that the true origin is a unique surface-like diffusion mechanism of the intercalation ions. In a surface-like migration event, a mobile ion moves along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance. It is similar to surface diffusion in the conventional picture and contrasts with lattice diffusion from one interstitial/vacancy site to another one with high coordination number, crowded saddle-point geometry and high migration barrier. We found that the shifting from solid-state lattice diffusion to surface-like diffusion is determined by the size difference between the mobile ion and the diffusion channel, and a lowest migration energy barrier can be reached by mediating the channel size. The analogy to gas diffusion in molecular sieves shall be discussed. Additionally, the effects of defects and crystal water in Prussian blue analogs were also discussed for better understanding their rate performances in experimental scenarios.
   Assisted by density functional theory calculations, we found in this study that the origin of the ultra-low migration energy barrier of intercalated ions in framework energy materials (e.g. Prussian blue analogs) is a unique surface-like diffusion mechanism. The mobile ion will move along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance similar to surface diffusion. image

AB Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated the secondary batteries market in the past few decades. However, their widespread application is seriously hampered by the limited lithium resource and high cost. Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have generated significant attention because of their characteristics of abundant raw sources, low cost, and similar "rocking chair" mechanism with LIBs, which hold great application potential in large-scale energy storage. Cathode materials with excellent electrochemical performance are in urgent demand for next-generation SIBs. Herein, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances of the most promising SIBs cathode candidates, including layered oxides, polyanionic materials, and Prussian blue analogues. The currently existing issues that need to be addressed for these cathodes are pointed out, such as insufficient energy density, low electron conductivity, air sensitivity, and so on. This review also details the structural characteristics of these three cathode candidates. Moreover, the recent optimization strategies for improving the electrochemical performance are summarized, including element doping, morphology modification, structure architecture, and so on. Finally, the current research status and proposed future developmental directions of these three cathode materials are concluded. This review aims to provide practical guidance for the development of cathode materials for next-generation SIBs.

TI Exploiting a pronounced photo-magnetic effect over the rational design
   of facile core-shell ferrowmagnet
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Designing artificial nanostructures with well-defined composite and morphology may create magic phenomena that are otherwise unattainable. In this work, we have synthesized a facile core-shell structure with CoFe2O4 as the core and Prussian blue analog as the shell (CoFe2O4@PBA). By introducing the photo-sensitive shell, this hybrid can perform unexpectedly great changes in saturation magnetization and coercivity under illumination at 5 K. Herein, we contribute this photo-magnetic effect to the valence state transition of Fe ions in CoFe2O4, which is induced by the optical-excited electrons transfer from the CoFe PBA shell to the CoFe2O4 core.

TI Graphene oxide suspension-based electrolyte promotes the cycling
   performance of aqueous sodium-ion batteries through the interaction
   between metal ions, free water molecules and functional groups
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-based aqueous batteries are promising solutions for large-scale energy storage. However, PBA cathode materials are still facing erosion and dissolution originating from the strong polarity and high proton activity of water leading to the destruction of their frameworks and poor cycling performance. Herein, we developed a new route to protect Sodium Prussian blue analogue (PB-Na, Na0.65Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.90)center dot square(0.09)center dot 2.7H(2)O) by introducing graphene oxide (GO) into the aqueous electrolyte, which can in-situ form an ion selectivity membrane on the separator surface. GO can prevent the diffusion of transition metal ions of dissolved PB-Na penetrating the separator to the anode material by the coordination interaction between transition metal ions and the oxygen-containing functional groups (carboxyl, carbonyl, etc). Meanwhile, hydrophilic groups (hydroxyl, carboxyl, etc) of GO can absorb free water molecules by hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction reducing the dissolution of PB-Na. Thus PB-Na cathode material-based sodium-ion batteries in the low-concentration aqueous electrolyte can still achieve a capacity of 65.5 mAh g(-1) and a high capacity retention of 65.1% after 17000 cycles. This strategy can be considered a simple and effective method to protect active materials in the aqueous batteries.

TI Bimetallic NiFe oxide structures derived from hollow NiFe Prussian blue
   nanobox for label-free electrochemical biosensing adenosine triphosphate
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB We designed and constructed a novel aptasensor based on the porous nanostructured bimetallic NiFe-oxides embedded with the mesoporous carbon (represented by NiOxFeOy@mC) for sensitively detecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP), of which the porous NiOxFeOy@mC was derived from the hollow NiFe Prussian blue analogue (hollow NiFe PBA) by calcinating under high temperature. Owning to the excellent electrochemical activity originated from the metal oxides and mesoporous carbon and the strong binding interaction between the aptamer strands and the nanostructure hybrid, the formed porous NiOxFeOy@mC composite calcinated at 900 degrees C exhibited superior sensitivity toward ATP determination in comparison with other porous nanocubes obtained at 500 and 700 degrees C. The proposed aptasensor not only revealed a wide linear range from 5.0 fg.mL(-1) to 5.0 ng with a extremely low detection limit of 0.98 fg.mL(-1) (1.62 fM) (S/N = 3), but also displayed high selectivity towards other interferences, good stability and reproducibility, and acceptable applicability. Therefore, this proposed approach provides a promising platform for ultra-sensitive detection of ATP, further having the potential applications on diagnosis of ATP-related diseases.

TI Metal Recovery from Natural Saline Brines with an Electrochemical Ion
   Pumping Method Using Hexacyanoferrate Materials as Electrodes
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The electrochemical ion pumping device is a promising alternative for the development of the industry of recovering metals from natural sources-such as seawater, geothermal water, well brine, or reverse osmosis brine-using electrochemical systems, which is considered a non-evaporative process. This technology is potentially used for metals like Li, Cu, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Sr, and others that are mostly obtained from natural brine sources through a combination of pumping, solar evaporation, and solvent extraction steps. As the future demand for metals for the electronic industry increases, new forms of marine mining processing alternatives are being implemented. Unfortunately, both land and marine mining, such as off-shore and deep sea types, have great potential for severe environmental disruption. In this context, a green alternative is the mixing entropy battery, which is a promising technique whereby the ions are captured from a saline natural source and released into a recovery solution with low ionic force using intercalation materials such as Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA) to store cations inside its crystal structure. This new technique, called "electrochemical ion pumping", has been proposed for water desalination, lithium concentration, and blue energy recovery using the difference in salt concentration. The raw material for this technology is a saline solution containing ions of interest, such as seawater, natural brines, or industrial waste. In particular, six main ions of interest-Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, and SO42--are found in seawater, and they constitute 99.5% of the world's total dissolved salts. This manuscript provides relevant information about this new non-evaporative process for recovering metals from aqueous salty solutions using hexacianometals such as CuHCF, NiHCF, and CoHCF as electrodes, among others, for selective ion removal.

TI Anomalous Stoichiometry, 3-D Bridged Triangular/Pentagonal Layered
   Structured Artificial Antiferromagnet for the Prussian Blue Analogue
   A3Mn<SUP>II</SUP>5(CN)13 (A =
   NMe4, NEtMe3). A Cation Adaptive Structure
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The size of the organic cation dictates both the composition and the extended 3-D structure for hybrid organic/inorganic Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) of A(a)Mn(II)b(CN)(a+2b) (A = cation) stoichiometry. Alkali PBAs are typically cubic with both MC6 and M'N6 octahedral coordination sites and the alkali cation content depends on the M and M' oxidation states. The reaction of Mn-II(O2CCH3)(2) and A(+)CN(-) (A = NMe4, NEtMe3) forms a hydrated material of A(3)Mn(5)(II)(CN)(13) composition. A(3)Mn(5)(II)(CN)(13) forms a complex, 3-D extended structural motif with octahedral and rarely observed square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal Mn-II sites with a single layer motif of three pentagonal and one triangular fused rings. A complex pattern of (MnCN)-C-II chains bridge the layers. (NMe4)(3)Mn-5(II)(CN)(13) possesses one low spin octahedral and four high-spin pentacoordinate Mn-II sites and orders as an antiferromagnet at 11 K due to the layers being bridged and antiferromagnetically coupled by the nonmagnetic cyanides. These are rare examples of intrinsic, chemically prepared and controlled artificial antiferromagnets and have the advantage of having controlled uniform spacing between the layers as they are not physically prepared via deposition methods. A(3)Mn(5)(CN)(13) (A = NMe4, NEtMe3) along with [NEt4](2)Mn-3(II)(CN)(8), [NEL4]Mn-3(II)(CN)(7), and Mn(CN)(2) form stoichiometrically related A(a)Mn(b)(II)(CN)(a+2b) (a = 0, b = 1; a = 2, b = 3; a = 1, b = 3; and a = 3, b = 5) series possessing unprecedented stoichiometries and lattice motifs. These unusual structures and stoichiometries are attributed to the very ionic nature of the high-spin N-bonded Mn-II ion that enables the maximization of the attractive van der Waals interactions via minimization of void space via a reduced angle MnNC. This A(a)Mn(b)(II)(CN)(a+2b) family of compounds are referred to as being cation adaptive in which size and shape dictate both the stoichiometry and structure.

TI Porous and defective NiCo2O4 spinel derived from
   bimetallic NiCo-based Prussian blue analogue for enhanced hydrogen
   production via the urea electro-oxidation reaction
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The efficient hydrogen production via overall water splitting is seriously restrained by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The substantially low potential for the urea electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) can tackle this problem by replacing the OER at the electrolyzer anode. Herein, the NiCo2O4 spinel with rich oxygen vacancies (O-v) and embedded within mesoporous carbon network (O-v-NiCo2O4@mC) was derived from NiCo-based Prussian blue analogous (NiCo PBA) and exploited as the bifunctional electrocatalyst of the UOR and OER for boost the hydrogen production via the overall water splitting. Benefiting to the regular skeleton and abundant dual metal sites of NiCo PBA, the derived O-v-NiCo2O4@mC comprises abundant oxygen vacancies, lattice defects, and adjustable electron structure. These features afford O-v-NiCo2O4@mC the improved UOR ability, showing the potential of 1.33 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with a small Tafel slopes of 31 mV dec(-1), remarkably lower than that of the OER (1.51 V versus RHE, Tafel slope = 85 mV dec(-1)). The UOR performance of O-v-NiCo2O4@mC substantially outperforms to most of the reported Co and/or Ni-based electrocatalysts. Impressively, the assembled two-electrode urea-assisted overall water splitting device shows the small voltage for the hydrogen production (1.43 V versus RHE) and good long-term stability. The present work can provide a new alternative for the efficient hydrogen production using the MOFs-derivatives.

TI A quasi-solid-state self-healing flexible zinc-ion battery using a
   dual-crosslinked hybrid hydrogel as the electrolyte and Prussian blue
   analogue as the cathode material
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Due to their excellent safety and lower cost, aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered extensive interest among various energy-storage systems. Here we report a quasi-solid-state self-healing AZIB by using a hybrid hydrogel which consists of dual-crosslinked polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol as a flexible electrolyte and a cobalt hexacyanoferrate (K3.24Co3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)<middle dot>12.6H(2)O) Prussian blue analogue as the cathode material. The obtained hybrid hydrogel showed a superhigh fracture strain of up to 1490%, which was almost 15 times higher than that of the original size. Due to the fast formation of hydrogen bonds, the self-healed hydrogel from two pieces still displayed 1165% strain upon failure. As a result, the self-healed battery delivered stable capacities of 119.1, 108.6 and 103.0 mA h g(-1) even after being completely cut into 2, 3 and 4 pieces, respectively. The battery capacity recovery rates for each bending cycle exceeded 99.5%, 99.8%, 98.6% and 98.9% during four continuous bending cycles (30 times bending at 90 degrees for each cycle), which indicates outstanding flexibility and self-healing capability. In parallel, the hydrogel electrolyte displayed a broader electrochemically stable window of 3.37 V due to the suppression of water splitting and low overvoltage during the 500 h cycling in a symmetric cell. Zinc dendrites were also suppressed as evidenced in symmetric cell measurements. The assembled AZIB exhibited an initial capacity of 176 mA h g(-1) upon vertical bending. The battery showed a reliable capacity of 140.7 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) after 100 cycles along with a coulombic efficiency of >99%. A reliable capacity of nearly 100 mA h g(-1) was retained after 300 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1). The highly flexible and self-healing AZIB demonstrates great potential in various wearable electronic devices.

TI Realizing the highly reversible Zn2+and Na+ dual ions storage in
   high-crystallinity nickel hexacyanoferrate microcubes for aqueous
   zinc-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with the 3D open framework are regarded as promising cathode candidates for aqueous Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). Among various PBAs, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) has attracted considerable attention because of its high operating voltage and economic merit. However, the cyclability of NiHCF is unsatisfactory due to poor structural stability during Zn 2 + ions insertion/deinsertion. Moreover, the ion storage mechanism of NiHCF in aqueous electrolytes has not been fully revealed yet. Herein, high-crystallinity NiHCF (HC-NiHCF) microcubes with improved structural stability and larger crystal plane spacing are synthesized. For the first time, highly reversible Zn 2 + ions and Na + ions coinsertion/extraction are achieved for the HC-NiHCF microcubes in mixed aqueous electrolyte, as evidenced by various observations including two separated discharge plateaus and sequential changes of Na 1s and Zn 2p signals in ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As a result, a high specific capacity of 73.9 mAh g -1 is obtained for the HC-NiHCF microcubes at 0.1 A g -1 , combined with enhanced cycle stability (75% vs. 16.4%) over 10 0 0 cycles at 2 A g -1 . The reversible Zn 2 + ions and Na + ions coinsertion in HC-NiHCF microcubes reveals a new ion storage mechanism of Ni-based PBAs in aqueous electrolytes.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

TI New Cubic Phases for
   T2M[CN]6•xH2O with T = Ni, Cu
   and M = Ru, Os: Improving the Robustness and Modulating the Electron
   Density at the Cavity Surfaces
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The four Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) under study in this contribution, T-2[M(CN)(6)]center dot xH(2)O, have an open framework structure with 50 % of vacancies for the hexacyanometallate building block. In this series, the metal T is always found at the surface of the formed system of cavities and has a partially naked coordination environment. In the as-synthesised materials, such available coordination sites are occupied by water molecules, which, in turn, stabilize additional water molecules inside the cavity through hydrogen bonding interactions. Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and related properties for the new title members of this family of coordination polymers, particularly for T = Ni, Cu and M = Ru, Os. To improve the material's crystallinity, the powders formed from the precipitation reaction were submitted to solvothermal recrystallization. Their crystal structure was solved and refined from the corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Unlike their Fe-II analogs, which crystallize in a Pm3m cubic structure, two types of cubic structures (depending on the external metal) were obtained: Fm3m for Ni-2[M(CN)(6)]center dot xH(2)O and Pm3m for Cu-2[M(CN)(6)]center dot xH(2)O. Such structural differences are properly supported by a detailed analysis of their IR and UV/Vis spectra. The stability of their porous network after water removal was evaluated by combining XRD, H-2 adsorption isotherms, and thermogravimetric curves. Hydrogen adsorption was also used to explore the adsorption potential at the cavity surface. Except Cu-2[Ru(CN)(6)]center dot xH(2)O, the other three materials appear to be stable after water removal under soft heating, which was ascribed to the role of the inner metal (Ru-II and Os-II) on the framework robustness. These two metals have extended t(2g) orbitals, which favor the occurrence of a strong coupling between the inner and outer metals in the -T-N equivalent to C-M-C equivalent to N-T- chain. Apparently, such overlapping for charge density contributes to the material's stability.

TI Prussian blue as positive electrode material for aqueous sodium-ion
   capacitor with excellent performance
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB High-quality Prussian blue (PB), whose crystals have a small number of vacancies, is synthesized by utilizing Na4Fe(CN)(6) as the only precursor. It is demonstrated that the crystals have an important influence on electrochemical performance. The PB electrode exhibits a specific capacity as high as 107 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) without apparent capacity loss after 1100 cycles in 0.5 mol L-1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution due to fewer vacancies. Furthermore, a sodium-ion capacitor is also fabricated by combining the PB as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode. It can operate at a cell voltage as high as 1.8 V with an energy density of 30 W h kg(-1). The capacitor displays not only high energy density but also excellent cycling stability because the as-prepared PB has outstanding ion storage capability and excellent structural stability. These results show that the PB is a promising candidate for aqueous sodium-ion capacitors.

TI Sequential Fe Reduction, Involving Two Different Fe plus Intermediates,
   in the Conversion Reaction of Prussian Blue in Lithium-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in operando 57Fe-Mo??ssbauer spectroscopy measurements are conducted to examine in detail the ongoing reaction mechanism of potassium Prussian blue (K-PB) within the narrow [1.6-0.005 V] voltage range, and so to determine whether this material truly undergoes a conversion reaction, as we proposed elsewhere. The generation of Fe0 is confirmed by both techniques, finding that 40 to 58% of iron gets reduced to metallic iron at 5 mV. The elucidation of the mechanism by in situ 57Fe-Mo??ssbauer spectroscopy further reveals a sequential process for the reduction (lithiation) of the two different iron species initially present in Prussian blue. Both high-spin Fe2+-N first and low-spin FeII-C next go through the unusual Fe1+/I formal oxidation state during the reduction process, before forming surface Fe0 nanoparticles (NPs) below 0.48 V. Upon charge, Fe0 NPs preferentially oxidizes into Fe+ -N. Interestingly, these surprising Fe+ species play an important role in decreasing the overpotential during the charge (delithiation) process with respect to other conversion systems

TI Aqueous Dual-Electrolyte Full-Cell System for Improving Energy Density
   of Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices and have been gradually grasping market share for their low cost and similar reaction mechanism and production process as compared to lithium-ion batteries. However, the low energy density of SIBs restricts their practical applications. For example, regular full cells of a Prussian blue cathode and NASICON anode have only a low discharge capacity (about 77 mA h/g at 1 C). Taking into account the compatibility of the electrolyte and electrode materials, a novel strategy for a viable aqueous dual-electrolyte sodium-ion battery (ADESIB) has been proposed using Na2SO4 solution as the anolyte and redox-active sodium hexacyanoferrate Na4Fe(CN)(6) solution as the catholyte to accommodate a NASICON NaTi2(PO4)(3) anode and Prussian blue Na2NiFe(CN)(6) cathode. The capacity of Na+ ion deinsertion/ insertion electrodes combined with the redox chemistry of the Na4Fe(CN)6 catholyte thus enhances overall charge storage and energy density. The ADESIB delivers a capacity of about 113 mA h/g at 1 C, showing a 43% improvement over batteries with a regular single Na2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, the dual-electrolyte full-cell system is proved to reach a 84.7% capacity retention after 1000 cycles, mainly due to the synergy of the electrolytes in both sides. This pioneering research proposes an aqueous dual-electrolyte sodium-ion full cell, showing potential applications in a new sodium-ion full battery system.

TI Regulating surfactant strategy to synthesize Co@NCNT nanocomposites with
   conductive networks towards excellent electromagnetic wave absorption
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB In this paper, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with different morphologies have been synthesized in a coprecipitation process with Na3C6H5O7 center dot 2H(2)O and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as surfactant, and then the electromagnetic wave absorption (EMWA) properties of their derivatives obtained via a pyrolysis reaction were investigated. To explore the best suitable pyrolysis temperature, PBA precursor synthesized via the addition of Na3C6H5O7 center dot 2H(2)O was annealed at four different temperatures (550/650/750/850 degrees C) to obtain the cobalt encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (Co@NCNT) nanocomposites. Our results show that when the pyrolysis temperature is 650 degrees C, the Co@NCNT shows a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of - 43.95 dB at the thickness of 2.05 mm, and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 5.695 GHz, spanning the X and Ku bands. The excellent EMWA property is ascribed to the synergistic effect of dielectric and magnetic loss.

TI Accessory ligand strategies for hexacyanometallate networks deriving
   perovskite polycrystalline electromagnetic absorbents
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The controllable adjustment of electromagnetic (EM) properties for high-efficiency EM absorbents are indispensable, nonetheless, rare in crystals engineering regulation. Herein, for the first time, regulated amount of sodium citrate was employed as accessory ligand of cobalt cation in aqueous solution to kinetically assist the controllable fabrication of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) and corresponding lanthanide perovskite hybrid CoFe alloy polycrystals. Especially, the multi-phase features were analyzed based on Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns, illustrating the existence of distortions, defects and heterogeneous interfaces in resultant polycrystals. Benefited to the dielectric and magnetic adjustment, polycrystalline absorbents achieved excellent impedance matching and EM attenuation, as the minimum reflection loss of CoFe/LaFeO3 and CoFe/LaFeO3/La2O3 reached -44.13 and -33.95 dB, ranking broadest effective bands up to 4.88 and 3.36 GHz. The validity of the strategy provided a novel sight into the controllable fabrication of high-performance magnetic semiconductor polycrystalline devices.

TI One-step construction of porous Ni/Co metal/oxide nanocubes for highly
   efficient oxygen evolution
SO ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB A one-step method to synthesize porous Ni/Co metal/oxide as highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is presented. Using Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue as both the precursor and the template, a simple oxidation in air at low temperatures results in the formation of Ni/Co metal/oxide nanocubes with fine particles. The optimized porous NiCoOx-400 exhibits excellent OER activity with a low onset of 1.40 V (vs. RHE), an overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 74 mV/decade in 0.1 M KOH solution, significantly superior to those of the state-of-the-art noble-metal OER catalyst IrO2/C. This approach offers the potential to generate highly active and low-cost OER catalysts on a large scale.

TI Rational design double S-scheme heterosystem based
   Photo-Electrocatalytic membrane device for continuous phytotoxin
   remediation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Today, the escalating contamination of water sources with phytotoxins poses a significant danger to both ecosystems and human health. Consequently, the implementation of advanced and sustainable remediation technologies becomes imperative for the effective removal of toxins. This study introduces a pioneering method for continuous phytotoxin remediation by integrating a photoelectrocatalytic membrane reactor, which utilizes a ZnCdFeSe heterojunction photocatalyst with a double S-scheme, is derived from the ZnCd prussian blue analog. This design capitalizes on the unique electronic structure and synergistic effects of the catalyst enabling efficient photo-electrocatalysis in the device. The proposed system attains an impressive phytotoxin rejection efficiency of 98.39%, accompanied by enhanced membrane permeation and anti-fouling performance. The obtained results are noteworthy for an emerging process that combines the simultaneous degradation and separation of toxic species, enabling prolonged and uninterrupted remediation processes. Experimental and density function theory (DFT) results demonstrate that, under optimal conditions, the well-stabilized double S-scheme ZnCdFeSe heterojunction achieves a mineralization rate of 85.67%. Even after six cycles of the photocatalytic membrane, the removal rate of ricin remains high at 78.96%, indicating the membrane's commendable reusability and stability. This research not only contributes to the advancement of innovative environmental remediation strategies but also provides valuable insights for designing and optimizing photoelectrocatalytic systems for the persistent removal of toxins in water treatment applications.

TI Cascaded Nanozyme Based pH-Responsive Oxygenation for Targeted
   Eradication of Resistant Helicobacter Pylori
SO SMALL
AB Nanozymes, as substitutes for natural enzymes, are constructed as cascade catalysis systems for biomedical applications due to their inherent catalytic properties, high stability, tunable physicochemical properties, and environmental responsiveness. Herein, a multifunctional nanozyme is reported to initiate cascade enzymatic reactions specific in acidic environments for resistant Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) targeting eradication. The cobalt-coated Prussian blue analog based FPB-Co-Ch NPs displays oxidase-, superoxide dismutase-, peroxidase-, and catalase- mimicking activities that trigger center dot O(2)(- )and H2O2 to supply O-2, thereby killing H. pylori in the stomach. To this end, chitosan is modified on the surface to exert bacterial targeted adhesion and improve the biocompatibility of the composite. In the intestinal environment, the cascade enzymatic activities are significantly inhibited, ensuring the biosafety of the treatment. In vitro, sensitive and resistant strains of H. pylori are cultured and the antibacterial activity is evaluated. In vivo, murine infection models are developed and its success is confirmed by gastric mucosal reculturing, Gram staining, H&E staining, and Giemsa staining. Additionally, the antibacterial capacity, anti-inflammation, repair effects, and biosafety of FPB-Co-Ch NPs are comprehensively investigated. This strategy renders a drug-free approach that specifically targets and kills H. pylori, restoring the damaged gastric mucosa while relieving inflammation.

TI Size-, Water-, and Defect-Regulated Potassium Manganese Hexacyanoferrate
   with Superior Cycling Stability and Rate Capability for Low-Cost
   Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) is a low-cost Prussian blue analogue (PBA) having a rigid and open framework that can accommodate large alkali ions. Herein, the synthesis of KMHCF and its application as a high-performance cathode in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) is reported. High-quality KMHCF with low amounts of crystal water and defects and with homogeneous microstructure is obtained by controlling the nucleation and grain growth by using a high-concentration citrate solution as a precipitation medium. The obtained KMHCF exhibits superior cycling and rate performance as a NIB cathode, showing 80% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C and a high capacity of 95 mA h g(-1) at 20 C. Unlike conventional single-cation batteries, the hybrid NIB with KMHCF as cathode and Na as anode in Na-ion electrolyte displays three reversible plateaus that involve stepwise insertion/extraction of both K+ and Na+ in the PBA framework. In later cycling, the K+-Na+ cointercalated phase is partially converted into a cubic sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMHCF) phase due to the increasing replacement of Na+ for K+.

AB Advanced electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials with strong absorption and broad bandwidth are important for military stealth and elimination of microwave pollution in consumers' electronics. Metal organic framework (MOF)-derived metal/carbon hybrids with ordered structure are significantly urgent in this field. In this contribution, we presented a design strategy of hollow cage-like or solid box-like magnetic/dielectric Fe/Co/C and dielectric Fe/Mn/C EM wave absorbing nanomaterialsviapyrolyzing Prussian blue's analogs with controllable topology and phase composition. The solid box-like Fe/Co/C and hollow cage-like Fe/Mn/C showed favorable absorption property with a broad effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) and a low reflection loss (RL). Especially, the EAB of 8.8 GHz at a thickness of 2.5 mm for solid box-like Fe/Co/C nanocomplex prepared at 900 degrees C is a new record for this type of materials. The design and tuning strategy for EM wave absorbers derived from topology-controllable MOF is important for EM functional materials possessing great potential in military stealth and consumers' electronics.

TI Green route to Prussian blue nanoparticles with high degradation
   efficiency of RhB under visible light
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) have been synthesized by using beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) as a surfactant and ethyl alcohol as a green solvent. The products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) to analyse the structure, morphology, surface elements, specific surface area and porosity, respectively. It was found that the specific surface area of PB-120 was 90.527 m(2) g(-1). When the as-prepared PBNPs were applied as heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalysts, they exhibit high catalytic efficiency and stability of degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light in neutral system. The catalytic degradation of 25 mg L-1RhB by PB-120 only needed 15 min, while the high degradation rate (83%) of RhB after 4 cycles of degradation could be achieved. The as-prepared PBNPs may be employed as excellent catalysts to degrade organic pollution. Graphic abstract

TI Bifunctional and Self-Supported NiFeP-Layer-Coated NiP Rods for
   Electrochemical Water Splitting in Alkaline Solution
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Designing efficient and robust nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts for overall water electrolysis, which is mainly limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), for hydrogen production remains a major challenge for the hydrogen economy. In this work, a bimetallic NiFeP catalyst is coated on nickel phosphide rods grown on nickel foam (NiFeP@NiP@NF). This self-supported and interfacially connected electrode structure is favorable for mass transfer and reducing electrical resistance during electrocatalysis. The preparation of NiFeP@NiP@NF is optimized in terms of (i) the coprecipitation time of the NiFe Prussian blue analogue layer that serves as phosphides precursor and (ii) the phosphidation temperature. The optimized sample exhibits excellent OER performance delivering current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 227 and 252 mV in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, and maintaining 10 mA cm(-2) for more than 120 h without obvious degradation. Moreover, it can also be operated as a hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst, requiring an overpotential of 105 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in the same medium. Thus, the as-prepared material was tentatively utilized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a symmetric electrolyzer, requiring a voltage bias of 1.57 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, while exhibiting outstanding stability.

TI Ligand Stabilization Strategy Boosted Electrode Kinetics in Cyanide
   Metal Organic Framework for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction
SO CHEMNANOMAT
AB Cyanide bridged frameworks are excellent pre-catalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction. Control the hydrolysis product is crucial for design of highly active catalyst. Herein, we introduced pyrazine molecules pillared Hofmann-type metal organic framework electrocatalysts. The in-situ formed amorphous hydroxide provided high electrocatalytic activity and the interplanar pyrazine molecule offered structural stability towards alkaline environment, which effectively boosted the OER catalytic activity by offering more accessible active sites. The enhanced structural stability was justified by Raman spectroscopy. The overpotential, Tafel slope, and turn over frequency of the as-synthesized Hofmann-type MOF reached 306 mV, 15.6 mV dec(-1) and 0.12 s(-1), which is significantly better than that of Prussian blue analogue. This work justified the effectiveness of the ligand stabilization strategy in boosting the activity in OER catalysts.

TI MOF-Derived Bimetallic CoFe-PBA Composites as Highly Selective and
   Sensitive Electrochemical Sensors for Hydrogen Peroxide and Nonenzymatic
   Glucose in Human Serum
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) combines the advantages of 2D materials, MOFs and PBAs, resolving the poor electronic conductivity and slow diffusion of MOF materials for electrochemical applications. In this work, 2D leaflike zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (Co-ZIF and Fe-ZIF) as sacrificial templates are in situ converted into PBAs, realizing the successful fabrication of PBA/ZIF nanocomposites on nickel foam (NF), namely, CoCo-PBA/Co-ZIF/NF, FeFe-PBA/Fe-ZIF/NF, CoFe-PBA/Co-ZIF/NF, and Fe/CoCo-PBA/Co-ZIF/NF. Such fabrication can effectively reduce transfer resistance and greatly enhance electron- and mass-transfer efficiency due to the electrochemically active PBA particles and NF substrate. These fabricated electrodes as multifunctional sensors achieve highly selective and sensitive glucose and H2O2 biosensing with a very wide detective linear range, extremely low limit of detection (LOD), and good stability. Among them, CoFe-PBA/Co-ZIF/NF exhibits the best sensing performance with a very wide linear range from 1.4 mu M to 1.5 mM, a high sensitivity of 5270 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), a low LOD of 0.02 mu M (S/N = 3), and remarkable stability and selectivity toward glucose. What is more, it can realize excellent detection of glucose in human serum, demonstrating its practical applications. Furthermore, this material as a multifunctional electrochemical sensor also manifests superior detection performance against hydrogen peroxide with a wide linear range of 0.2-6.0 mM, a high sensitivity of 196 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), and a low limit of detection of 1.08 nM (S/N = 3). The sensing mechanism for enhanced performance for glucose and H2O2 is discussed and proved by experiments in detail.

TI Yolk@shell nanoreactor with coordinately unsaturated metal sites on MOF
   surface inside polypyrrole capsule: Enhanced catalytic activity and
   lowered metal leaching in fenton-like reaction
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based Fenton-like reaction, there was an irreconcilable contradiction between improving the catalytic activity and lowering the metal leaching, since the more catalytic sites exposed, the better activity and the easier leaching. In this work, we have provided a feasible method to address this problem by preparing yolk@shell structure with coordinately unsaturated metal sites on Prussian blue analogue (CUMSs-PBA) nanocubes surface inside the polypyrrole (PPy) capsule. On CUMSs-PBA surface, a large amount of metal sites were exposed and functioned as Lewis acid. As Lewis base, PMS adsorption and activation were encouraged via Lewis acid-base reaction, leading to an enhanced activation efficiency. PMS and pollutants were confined inside the yolk@shell nanoreactor with a limited cavity space, leading to an ultra-high concentration and accelerated degradation rate. In this case, the PMS activation path was altered, and the contributions of OH and O-1(2) were largely improved in comparison with SO4-. Generally, the metal leaching was worsened due to the lack of ligand protection on coordinately unsaturated metal sites. Fortunately, the PPy shell was compacted and the pore size on shell was narrowed during the heat-treatment, resulting in the suppression effect on outward diffusion of leached metal ions. Therefore, improving catalytic activity and lowering metal leaching were simultaneously realized in the CUMSs-PBA@PPy nanoreactor.

TI Size and crystallinity effects on enzymatic activity and
   anti-inflammatory properties of cysteine-assisted Prussian blue
   nanozymes
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) exhibit multiple enzymatic activities, such as superoxide dismutase-like, catalase-like, and peroxidase-like activities, which enable them to effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects. To further enhance the enzymatic activity of PB NPs, it is crucial to explore the relationship between their physicochemical properties, such as size and crystallinity, and their enzymatic performance. In this study, PB NPs were synthesized using different pH levels and varying concentrations of cysteine (Cys) as a stabilizer. As the size decreases, crystallinity is gradually reduced, and defects increase. Cys-PB NPs with a smaller size and lower crystallinity exhibited high peroxidase-like activity, effectively reducing inflammation and scavenging intracellular ROS in vitro. Additionally, the stability of Cys-PB NPs plays a critical role in their anti-inflammatory properties, with higher stability favouring anti-inflammatory effect.

TI Facile synthesis of cobalt hexacyanoferrate/graphene nanocomposites for
   high-performance supercapacitor
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Prussian blue and its analogues are promising for energy storage devices owing to the rigid open framework, yet suffer from poor conductivity and relatively low energy density. Herein, we report a facile preparation of cobalt hexacyanoferrate/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (CoHCF/rGO) for supercapacitors with enhanced performance. The CoHCF nanoparticles with a size of around 50 nm are adhered onto the rGO nanosheets, which, in turn, not only prevent the agglomeration of the CoHCF nanoparticles but also provide conductive network for fast electron transport. The CoHCF/rGO nanocomposite delivers a maximum specific capacitance of 361 F g(-1) in Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Asymmetric supercapacitor cells are assembled by pairing up an optimized nanocomposite electrode with an activated carbon negative electrode, which exhibits a wide reversible operating voltage of 2.0 V and a high energy density of 39.6 Wh kg(-1). The enhanced electrochemical performance of CoHCF/rGO benefits from the strong synergistic utilization of CoHCF nanoparticles and rGO nanosheets, rendering the nanocomposites a great promise for high-performance supercapacitors.

TI A Curcumin-Modified Coordination Polymers with ROS Scavenging and
   Macrophage Phenotype Regulating Properties for Efficient Ulcerative
   Colitis Treatment
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Overexpression of classically activated macrophages (M1) subtypes and assessed reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are often observed in patients with ulcerative colitis. At present, the treatment system of these two problems has yet to be established. Here, the chemotherapy drug curcumin (CCM) is decorated with Prussian blue analogs in a straightforward and cost-saving manner. Modified CCM can be released in inflammatory tissue (acidic environment), eventually causing M1 macrophages to transform into M2 macrophages and inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors. Co(III) and Fe(II) have abundant valence variations, and the lower REDOX potential in CCM-CoFe PBA enables ROS clearance through multi-nanomase activity. In addition, CCM-CoFe PBA effectively alleviated the symptoms of UC mice induced by DSS and inhibited the progression of the disease. Therefore, the present material may be used as a new therapeutic agent for UC.

SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Using a novel, irregular honeycombed N-doped porous carbon (NPC) as a support and defect inducer, defect-rich Zn-PBA was formed in situ and evenly anchored on the surface of NPC to obtain a defect-rich Zn-PBA/NPC composite. This composite demonstrated an ultrafast Cs+ adsorption rate that reached equilibrium within 60 s as well as excellent adsorption capacity, stability and reusability. The adsorption mechanism indicated that Cs+ was quickly adsorbed via the defect sites close to the Zn-PBA crystal face accompanied by K(OH2)(+) elimination.

TI Charge transfer driven by ultrafast spin transition in a CoFe Prussian
   blue analogue
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB Photoinduced charge-transfer is an important process in nature and technology and is responsible for the emergence of exotic functionalities, such as magnetic order for cyanide-bridged bimetallic coordination networks. Despite its broad interest and intensive developments in chemistry and material sciences, the atomic-scale description of the initial photoinduced process, which couples intermetallic charge-transfer and spin transition, has been debated for decades; it has been beyond reach due to its extreme speed. Here we study this process in a prototype cyanide-bridged CoFe system by femtosecond X-ray and optical absorption spectroscopies, enabling the disentanglement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics. Our results demonstrate that it is the spin transition that occurs first on the Co site within similar to 50 fs, and it is this that drives the subsequent Fe-to-Co charge-transfer within similar to 200 fs. This study represents a step towards understanding and controlling charge-transfer-based functions using light.

TI Single-walled carbon nanotubes as a reducing agent for the synthesis of
   a Prussian blue-based composite: a quartz crystal microbalance study
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB We investigated the synthesis mechanism of Prussian blue (PB) crystals supported on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), by performing in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements to probe the change in the electrode mass during the reaction, and using photoirradiation at designated stages of the process. We found that in contrast to existing hypotheses, light irradiation played no role in the synthesis process of Prussian blue on SWCNTs. On the other hand, the number of electrons transferred per one mole of the obtained product, and the number of electrons transferrable from SWCNTs, calculated from the density of states (DOS) of the SWCNTs in the sample, both favor the hypothesis of the reaction being triggered by direct electron transfer from SWCNTs to Fe3+, which occurs because of the energy difference between the Fermi level of SWCNTs and redox potential of Fe3+ ions.

AB The superior rate capabilities of metal ion battery materials based on Prussianblue analogues (PBAs) are almost exclusively ascribed to the extremely fast solid-state ionicdiffusion, which is possible due to structural voids and spacious three-dimensional channels inPBA structures. We performed a detailed electroanalytical study of alkali ion diffusivities innanosized cation-rich and cation-poor PBAs obtained as particles or electrodepositedfilms inboth aqueous and non-aqueous media, which resulted in a solid conclusion about theexceptionally slow ionic transport. We show that the impressive rate capability of PBAmaterials is determined solely by the small size of the primary particles of PBAs, while theapparent diffusion coefficients are 3-5 orders of magnitude lower than those reported inearlier studies. Ourfinding calls for a reconsideration of the apparent facility of ionic transportin PBA materials and deeper analysis of the charge carrier-host interactions in PBAs

TI NiFe-Prussian blue analogs catalyst for glucose electrolytic hydrogen
   production and biomass valorization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Making green hydrogen from natural biomass glucose electrolysis represents a successful win-win scenario which not only achieves energy-efficient hydrogen production but also yields high-value-added chemicals. Herein, we report a NiFe-PBA catalyst synthesized by a facile co-precipitation method for glucose electrooxidation reaction (GOR). Benefiting from the unique ligand structure and the optimal electron, the Ni1 center dot 6Fe-PBA achieves a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a potential of only 1.42 V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE), and it maintains potential stability for 50 h. Through an intermittent multipotential-step method it was known that NiOOH is the active site of GOR. Based on the superior GOR activity of this catalyst, we constructed a two-electrode glucose electrolysis hydrogen making system. At a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), this system reduced the voltage of 230 mV compared to traditional water electrolysis. This improvement significantly reduces energy consumption, requiring only 43.4 kWh to produce 1 kg of H-2, saving 6.1 kWh of energy power. To our excitement, we analyzed the electrolyte after stability measurement and found the production of GRA, an important platform molecule for chemical industry and medical treatment. This research provides a promising and sustainable approach for efficient hydrogen production and the value-up of biomass feed-stock.

   networks reinforced prussian blue for high performance Na-ion battery
   cathode
SO NANO ENERGY
AB 3D ultra-thin carbon networks are ideal skeleton structures for loading active materials as energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, excellent cathode materials for sodium ion batteries were successfully prepared by homogeneously anchoring NaxKyMnFe(CN)(6) (x+ y <= 2, NaK-MnHCF) on hierarchical porous 3D N-doped ultra-thin carbon networks (3DNC). The compounds present a high reversible capacity, good rate performance, and superior cycling stability. Combined fully experimental analysis and first-principles calculation, the interfacial synergistic effect between 3DNC and NaK-MnHCF on the sodium storage capacity is revealed, contributing to the extra capacity and electrical conductivity. Furthermore, considerable content of capacitive-controlled sodium storage of NaK-MnHCF@3DNC conduces to the rate performance. These results reveal an efficient route for the fabrication of other cathode materials for sodium ion batteries as high-performance energy storage devices.

TI Nanozyme-Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Disease Prevention
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs are developed. Specifically, Prussian blue family nanozymes are chosen based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme-like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors made them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme-CCLs is demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs. These OSDs' prevention nanozyme-CCLs can pave the way for CCLs toward powerful wearable biomedical devices and provide novel strategies for the rational utilization of nanomaterials in clinical practice.
   Multicolor Prussian blue family nanozymes with antioxidant abilities are embedded into cosmetic contact lenses to prevent ocular surface diseases, minimize potential safety risks, and protect corneas from external stimulation and underlying systemic diseases via reactive oxygen species scavenging.image

TI Polyphenol assisted assembly of prussian blue analogs nanocrystals
   decorated 3D GO functional microspheres for polymer fiber bifunctional
   membrane with high oil-water emulsion permeability and powerful
   photocatalytic self-cleaning ability
SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Due to the intricate components of wastewater and physical stacking of graphene oxide (GO), the current GO membranes exhibit the fatal defects of low porosity and poor anti-fouling ability. Herein, a three dimensional (3D) FeCo-PBA@GO functional microsphere was constructed via anchoring GO nanosheets onto hard template of 3D polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microsphere driven by hydrogen bond and van der Waals force. On this basis, the Prussian blue analogs nanocrystals (FeCo-PBA) grew in situ on such functional microsphere and further assembled onto porous polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber mat through the tannic acid assisted spraying technique, resulting in highly permeable and photocatalytic self-cleaning FeCo-PBA@GO/PAN fibrous composite membrane. Interestingly, the unique 3D nanostructure of FeCo-PBA@GO microsphere arranging on membrane surface effectively prevented the dense physical stacking of GO nanosheets and increased the oil repellence property, thereby regulating the water channel and breaking through permeability limitation of membrane. As a result, the composite membrane exhibited superior separation fluxes (>3029 L m(-2) h(-1)) for different oil/water (O/W) emulsions, with rejection rate above 99.0 %. Owing to rich active sites and enhanced electron/mass transport property of FeCo-PBA functional layer, the composite membrane could effectively degrade various dyes by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, with the degradation efficiency of 93.1-96.9 % within 40 min and demonstrated favorable antifouling and photocatalytic self-cleaning ability after cycling separation of O/W emulsion. In addition, the generated multiple reactive oxygen species and photocatalytic mechanism were proposed. This work provides a versatile pathway to prepare multifunctional GO advanced membranes for large-scale treatment of complex emulsified oily wastewater.

TI CeO2-modulated CoP derived from prussian blue analogue
   boosting hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysis
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Molecular hydrogen has been considered as ideal energy carrier due to its high calorific value and clean product, which also requires eco-friendly generation process. Electrocatalytic H-2 evolution from water splitting represents a compelling sustainable and green energy technology, but it is severely hindered by the large overpotential needed, especially for non-noble metal electrocatalysts. In this study, an interface engineering strategy is extended to improve the catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of CoP by introducing CeO2 component. The novel heterostructure of CoP/CeO2 is successfully fabricated by a selective phosphidation treatment of pre-synthesized Co-PBA/CeO2 hybrid precursor. The introduced CoP/ CeO2 hetero-interface would regulate the electronic structure, accelerate charge transfer and enhance the intrinsic activity of the active sites. By optimizing the content of functional CeO2 entity, the CoP/CeO2-2.5 is the most active electrocatalyst with the lowest overpotential of 152 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current in 1.0 M KOH, as well as a Tafel slope of 83.5 mV dec(-1). Besides, CoP/CeO2-2.5 can also continuously operate well for more than 16 h, demonstrating the good durability of this electrocatalyst. This work would broaden the advanced HER electrocatalysts by fabricating hetero-interface with different functional components.

TI Potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate as a high-voltage cathode material for
   nonaqueous magnesium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The magnesium insertion capability of Prussian blue (PB) analogue, potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate K0.86Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.954)(H2O)(0.766) (KNF-086), is demonstrated as a cathode material for rechargeable magnesium-ion batteries using a conventional organic electrolyte. K1.51Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.954)(H2O)(0.766) is synthesized first, and potassium ions are electrochemically extracted to prepare the KNF-086 cathode. The electrochemical test cell is composed of KNF-086 as the working electrode, an activated carbon as the counter and reference electrode, and 0.5 M Mg(ClO4)(2) in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. The cell shows a reversible magnesium insertion/extraction reaction with a discharge capacity of 48.3 mAh g(-1) at a 0.2 degrees C rate, and an average discharge voltage at 2.99 V (vs. Mg/Mg2+) that is the highest among the cathode materials ever reported for magnesium-ion batteries. Elemental analysis and Fourier electron-density map analysis from powder X-ray diffraction data confirm that the magnesium-inserted phase is Mg0.27K0.86Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.954)(H2O)(0.766) (MKNF-086), and the magnesium ions in MKNF-086 are positioned at the center of the large interstitial cavities of cubic PB. Compared to KNF-086, MKNF-086 exhibits a decreased unit cell parameter (0.8%) and volume (2.4%). These results demonstrate that a PB analogue, potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate, could be utilized as a potential cathode material for conventional organic electrolyte-based magnesium-ion batteries.

TI Facile vacancies engineering of CoFe-PBA nanocubes for enhanced oxygen
   evolution
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is known as the key for the large-scale production of hydrogen through electrochemical processes. Developing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts with well-defined structure remains a considerable challenge. Herein, a unique and facile Ar plasma treatment was introduced to modify cobalt iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe-PBA) immobilized nickel foam (NF). The in situ generated carbon-nitrogen vacancies can effectively tune the local coordination environment and electronic structure of metal active sites in CoFe-PBA, thus improving the OER performance. The combination of CoFe-PBA and NF presents a 3D interworking network structure with highly exposed active sites and excellent electrical conductivity, guaranteeing stable and efficient OER process. The as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibited ex-cellent OER performance with an overpotential of 256 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec-1. This work presents a facile strategy for the design and fabrication of highly efficient PBA-based OER electrocatalyst, and enriches our understanding of the structure-property re-lationship of the plasma-engineered electrocatalyst.

TI Investigating the oxidase-like activity of a Co-Fe Prussian blue
   analogue nanocube prepared in situ and its applications in the
   colorimetric detection of ascorbic acid, alkaline phosphatase,
   α-glucosidase, and ascorbic acid oxidase
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Herein, a Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue nanocube (Co-Fe PBA NC) was prepared in situ via a simple and rapid coprecipitation method at room temperature, and the synthesized nanocube was systematically characterized. The Co-Fe PBA NC was proven to have intrinsic oxidase-like activity, which can catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anions (O-2(-)), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), in a dissolved oxygen system without the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). By making full use of the oxidase-like activity of the Co-Fe PBA NC and using the chromogenic substrate 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), a colorimetric sensor was fabricated for the detection of ascorbic acid (AA) and its related biological enzymes' activities, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alpha-glucosidase (alpha-Glu), and ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO), in human serum. This study presents an oxidase mimic that can be synthesized via a simple, rapid, and low-cost method, which overcomes the defects of cumbersome and time-consuming synthetic process, dependence on professional instruments and high cost of some previously reported nanozymes. In addition, this study provides a new multifunctional colorimetric sensing platform for AA and its related biological enzymes, showing great potential in biological assays.

TI Two-electron redox chemistry enables potassium-free copper
   hexacyanoferrate as high-capacity cathode for aqueous Mg-ion battery
SO INFOMAT
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are potential contestants for aqueous Mg-ion batteries (AMIBs) on account of their high discharge voltage and three-dimensional open frameworks. However, the low capacity arising from single reaction site severely restricts PBAs' practical applications in high-energy-density AMIBs. Here, an organic acid co-coordination combined with etching method is reported to fabricate defect-rich potassium-free copper hexacyanoferrate with structural water on carbon nanotube fiber (D-CuHCF@CNTF). Benefiting from the high-valence-state reactive sites, arrayed structure and defect effect, the well-designed D-CuHCF@CNTF exhibits an extraordinary reversible capacity of 146.6 mAh g-1 with two-electron reaction, nearly close to its theoretical capacity. It is interesting to unlock the reaction mechanism of the Fe2+/Fe3+ and Cu+/Cu2+ redox couples via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal that Fe and Cu in potassium-free D-CuHCF participate in charge transfer during the Mg2+ insertion/extraction process. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a rocking-chair fiber-shaped AMIBs was constructed via coupling with the NaTi2(PO4)3/CNTF anode, achieving high energy density and impressive mechanical flexibility. This work provides new possibilities to develop potassium-free PBAs with dual-active sites as high-capacity cathodes for wearable AMIBs. image

TI Effective adsorption and enhanced degradation of various pesticides from
   aqueous solution by Prussian blue nanorods
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Organophosphorus pesticides are most popular and broadly used owing to high-efficiency and organochlorines have longer persistence and irregular use in developing countries. The potential of bioaccumulation and persistence coupled with their toxicity call for development of effective low-cost elimination methods Prussian blue (Iron hexacyanoferrate; FeHCF) and its analogues have been widely employed in several applications due to outstanding characteristics (high surface area and photo-induced properties). Hence, highly crystalline and sharp hexagonal nanorods (< 60 nm) of FeHCF were synthesized using Sapindus-mukorossi and subsequently used for degradation of toxic pesticides; a-hexachloro cyclohexane (alpha-HCH), malathion and chlorpyrifos (CP). Under sunlight, a rapid initial exponential decrease in concentration of each pesticide (50 mg L-1) over time revealed high adsorption capacity of catalyst (surface area: 69.38 m(2)/g). Statistics supported first order degradation kinetics and Langmuir isotherms at optimum photocatalyst-dose (25 mg) and neutral pH. Within 12 h, high degradation (%) of malathion (95%; t(1/2) = 2.3 h) on acidic surface of catalysts followed by CP (92%; 4 h) and a-HCH (90%; 5.8 h) may attributed to high electron density. The lowest photodegradation of a-HCH might be due to its high stability and resistance towards oxidation. The finding of GC-MS peaks for small byproducts (glycerol, butyric acid, butane-1,2,4-triol, 3,4,4-trihydroxybut 3 en 2 one, phosphonic acid, and butane-1,4-diol) clearly supported free radical (center dot OH) based oxidation of pesticides. Besides, FeHCF catalyst (with low band gap) can be easily photo-activated. Overall, greater active sites, high surface activity, low band gap and semi conducing nature of FeHCF make it promising photocatalyst for waste-water-treatment.

AB A magnetic proximity effect has been observed in core-shell structure of molecular magnet, Mn-1.5[Cr(CN)(6)]center dot mH(2)O@Ni-1.5[Cr(CN)(6)]center dot nH(2)O, synthesized using a ferrimagnetic core of Mn-1.5[Cr(CN)(6)]center dot 7.5H(2)O surrounded by a ferromagnetic shell of Ni-1.5[Cr(CN)(6)]center dot 7.5H(2)O. The values of Curie temperature (T-C) are found to be of similar to 65 and similar to 60K for the bare-core and bare-shell compounds, respectively. However, an enhanced T-C (similar to 70K) has been observed for the core-shell structure. The proximity effect (due to presence of interface exchange coupling) between core and shell is responsible for the observed enhancement of T-C. A neutron depolarization study also confirms finite depolarization below similar to 70K. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Efficient photocatalytic degradation of emerging pollutants by green
   synthesized Prussian blue analogue nanocomposite
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB Worldwide consumption, toxicity, and bioaccumulation of paracetamol (PCM) and atenolol (ATL) has drawn attention of researchers over last decades. A small portion of these drugs is absorbed by human body and rest of them is excreted through urine and feces to the environment (water bodies and soil) which might result in negative impacts. Nanocomposite of chromium oxide coupled with zinc hexacyanocobaltates (Cr2O3@ZnHCC) was synthesized by a green-method using Sapindus mukorossi seed-extract for the removal of targeted drugs. Microscopic and spectroscopic analysis of Cr2O3@ZnHCC showed uniformly incorporated prisms into cubic structure having similar to 75 nm particle size. Well-characterized Cr2O3@ZnHCC and individuals (Cr2O3 & ZnHCC) were utilized for the degradation of PCM and ATL under direct sunlight and dark conditions. Highest degradation of targeted drugs (91%-94%) resulted at 20 mg L-1 concentration of pollutant, 25 mg of catalyst dose, and pH similar to 7 under daylight exposure (5 h). First-order kinetics followed with a high adsorption capacity, X-m (13.4-14.5 mg g(-1)) value was obtained to confirm the strong binding with the pollutants. Moreover, Cr2O3@ZnHCC substantially suppressed the half-life of targeted drugs (PCM: 0.6 h; ATL: 2.9 h) and converted them into safer-small metabolites as confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass-spectrometry analysis, and the reduction of carbon content was confirmed by total organic carbon analysis. The charge separation mechanism was assisted by UV reflectance and photoluminescence data. The synthesized green-nano photocatalyst displayed high reproducibility (up to 10th cycle), sensitivity, and stability during the degradation process which makes this a suitable candidate for industrial applications.

TI Modulating morphologies and electromagnetic wave absorption performances
   of 3d-4f PBA derivatives with transition metal ions
SO CARBON
AB Prussian blue analog (PBA) derivatives are widely utilized as high-performance electromagnetic wave absorption (EMWA) materials. Despite their potential, the specific impact of different metal ions on the morphology and EMWA performance of 3d-4f PBAs has remained unclear. Herein, using a coprecipitation method and different transition metal ions, we synthesized DyM(CN)6 (M = Fe, Co) PBAs of different morphologies: six-petal flowerlike structure for DyFe(CN)6 and an elliptical seed shape for DyCo(CN)6. Upon annealing, Dy2O3/Fe@CNT and Dy2O3/Co@CNT composites (CNT = carbon nanotube) maintaining their original shapes were prepared. The Dy2O3/Co@CNT composite, in particular, showed excellent EMWA properties with an RLmin of -48.32 dB at 15.44 GHz and an EAB of 5.68 GHz at an ultrathin thickness of only 1.75 mm. This performance is attributed to optimized impedance matching and synergistic magnetic-dielectric effects, along with interfacial polarization from Dy2O3, Co, and CNT interfaces. The simulated radar cross-section (RCS) confirms the excellent EMW attenuation capability of Dy2O3/Co@CNT and shows immense potential for practical application. This work offers a new approach to developing high-performance EMWA materials of 3d-4f PBA derivatives.

TI Engineering Synergetic Fe-Co Atomic Pairs Anchored on Porous Carbon for
   Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The rational design of heteronuclear dual-atom catalyst (DAC) is intricate due to the random dispersion of metal atoms under thermal treatment. Herein, a novel precursor pre-orientation strategy is reported to construct Fe-Co diatomic sites atomically dispersed on nitrogen doped carbon (Fe-Co-NC) via cubic Prussian blue analogue as metal source. Due to the specific synergy between Fe and Co centers, the obtained Fe-Co-NC catalyst renders outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with positive half-wave potential and good durability in wide pH range. Density functional theory further clarifies the active centers and reveals that the Fe-Co-NC dual atomic catalyst follows the modulation mechanism, where the intermediates tended to adsorb on Fe site, while the neighboring Co atom can assist by lowering the d-band center of Fe site. Experimentally and theoretically emphasizes the priority of heteronuclear diatomic Fe-Co catalysts over homonuclear Fe-Fe-NC and Co-Co-NC DAC. Moreover, the Zn-Air battery (ZAB) and microbial fuel cell (MFC) assembled with Fe-Co-NC cathodes both exhibit splendid power density (382 mW cm-2 for ZAB, 2034 +/- 103 mW m-2 for MFC) as well as excellent stability. This work provides a new perspective for rational construction and precise regulation for heteronuclear dual-atom catalysts.

TI Electrochemical Transformation of Metal Organic Framework into Ultrathin
   Metal Hydroxide-(oxy)hydroxide Nanosheets for Alkaline Water Oxidation
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Electrochemical water oxidation requires a highly active electrocatalyst system with improved catalytic activity, high mechanical stability, and strong catalyst-support interactions. In this respect, a unique and facile method has been developed for the synthesis of ultrathin Fe-Co(OH)(2)-Co(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets from self-supported Prussian blue analogues by chronoamperometric method. High electrochemical surface area, improved electronic conductivity, enhanced mechanical stability, and atomic level thickness (similar to 3 nm) of the self-supported ultrathin nanosheets provided the boost for alkaline water oxidation. The ultrathin Fe-Co(OH)(2)-Co(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets demonstrated 10 mA cm(-2) current density at only 250 mV overpotential for alkaline water oxidation. The ultrathin nanosheets also showed 24 h continuous oxygen evolution under chronoamperometric condition without losing the initial activity.

TI The characterization and application of prussian blue at graphene coated
   carbon fibers in a separated adsorption and electrically switched ion
   exchange desorption processes of cesium
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Iron hexacyanoferrate/graphene/carbon fibers composite (PB/GN/CFs) was prepared by electrochemical method. Characterization of PB/GN/CFs in a separated adsorption and electrically switched ion exchange desorption processes (Ads-ESIX) of cesium ions (Cs+) was confirmed by FE-SEM, XRD, IR, XPS and electrochemistry techniques. PB/GN/CFs displayed two quasi reversible transformations from Fe-4(III)(Fe-II(CN)(6))(3) to Fe-4(III)(Fe-III(CN)(6)Cl)(3), or to (NH4)(4)Fe-4(II)[Fe-II(CN)(6)](3) at a potential range of -0.1-1.2 V in pH 2, 0.1 M NH4Cl. The recovery of Cs+ was investigated by PB/GN/CFs using Ads-ESIX method. Cs+ could be selectively adsorbed by PB/GN/CFs from aqueous solution in pH 7.0, and desorbed in pH 2, 0.1 M NH4Cl. The desorption rate of Cs+ depended on the introduction of potential at PB/GN/CFs in pH 2, 0.1 M NH4Cl. Both H3O+ and NH4+ could play dual role of electrolyte and competitor for the desorption of Cs+. PB/GN/CFs could be used to the recovery of Cs+ from the residual salt lake brine in which potasium had been removed from Qarham playa of Qaidam Basin in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Nitrogen-doped cobalt-iron oxide cocatalyst boosting
   photoelectrochemical water splitting of BiVO4 photoanodes
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB Photoelectrochemical water splitting using bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes is of special interest for solar energy utilization. However, its solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency is hindered by unfavorable surface re-action kinetics, which requires the development of efficient cocatalysts. Here, a nitrogen-doped cobalt-iron oxide (N-CFO) cocatalyst layer is designed on the BiVO4 (BVO) by using Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursor. The N-CFO/BVO photoanode exhibits an improved photocurrent density of 4.83 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is 4.13-fold that of pure BVO photoanode and surpasses that of CFO/BVO with oxygen vacancies. Mechanism studies reveal that compared with oxygen vacancies, ni-trogen dopants greatly enhance electrical conductivity and boost reaction activity of cobalt-iron oxide. Owing to the diverse composition of PBAs, this work provides a novel insight into the effects of nitrogen dopants, as well as a general strategy to design efficient and cheap cocatalysts for photoanodes.

TI Co3O4/Co nano-heterostructures embedded in N-doped carbon for lithium-O2
   batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Rational design and synthesis of high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with increased effective active sites and facilitated mass/electron transfer are in demand for the lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) to overcome the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution kinetics. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is proposed by annealing the Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor under altered calcination conditions to achieve the efficient nano-heterojunction catalysts with optimized active sites. As a result, the obtained porous Co3O4/Co nanoheterostructures embedded in N-doped graphitized carbon matrix (Co3O4/Co@NC) exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity of 22,156 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 and excellent stability, obviously superior to the LOBs based on the other single-component catalysts. Systematic investigations suggest that the enhanced electrochemical performance is ascribed to the Co3O4/Co nanoheterostructure interface and the N-doped porous carbon matrix. This study presents a simple and effective approach for boosting the PBA-derived catalysts with efficient reactivity for various catalytic applications.

TI Incorporating Near-Pseudocapacitance Insertion Ni/Co-Based
   Hexacyanoferrate and Low-Cost Metallic Zn for Aqueous K-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB The limited availability of cathode materials with high specific capacity and significant cycling stability for aqueous K-ion batteries (AKIBs) hinder their further development owing to the large radius of K+ (1.38 angstrom). Prussian blue and its analogs with a three-dimensional frame structure possessing special energy storage mechanism are promising candidates as cathode materials for AKIBs. In this study, K0.2Ni0.68Co0.77Fe(CN)(6) center dot 1.8H(2)O (KNCHCF) was prepared as a cathode material for AKIBs. Both the electrochemical activity of Co ions and the near-pseudocapacitance intercalation of KNCHCF enhance K+ storage. Therefore, KNCHCF exhibits a superior capacity maintenance rate of 86 % after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 3.0 A g(-1). The storage mechanism of K+ in AKIBs was revealed through ex situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Moreover, the assembled K-Zn hybrid battery showed good cycling stability with 93.1 % capacity maintenance at 0.1 A g(-1) after 50 cycles and a high energy density of 96.81 W h kg(-1). Hence, KNCHCF may be a potential material for the development of AKIBs.

TI Porous hydrogel scaffolds integrating Prussian Blue nanoparticles: A
   versatile strategy for electrochemical (bio)sensing
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
AB Hydrogels have emerged as promising porous soft materials from which to develop a wide range of biosensing platforms due to the possibility to easily engineer their properties and to effectively immobilize enzymes and nanomaterials in their matrix. Despite their attractive properties, the ability to form stable hydrogel films integrating well-dispersed catalytic nanomaterials and enzymes on electrode surfaces is still required to enable their implementation into electrochemical biosensors. Here, we report a facile approach to prepare hydrogel films embedding Prussian Blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) and different enzymes on electrode surfaces for electrochemical biosensing. A one-pot strategy was employed for the synthesis, under mild conditions, of PBNPs and the simultaneous immobilization of enzymes in a highly functionalized carboxymethyl cellulose matrix, yielding homogeneous hydrogel composites. Highly porous hydrogel films were successfully prepared by drop casting the hydrogel composites on the surface of flexible screen-printed electrodes (SPEs). Due to the high loading of well-dispersed PBNPs, the hydrogel films demonstrated good electrocatalytic activity for both the oxidation of NADH and the reduction of hydrogen peroxide resulting in high detection sensitivity. Two amperometric biosensors for the rapid detection of glucose and ethanol in serum were realized by employing hydrogel composites integrating glucose oxidase and alcohol dehydrogenase. By combining the unique features of hydrogels on flexible electrochemical strips, our approach holds great promise for the development of portable electrochemical (bio)sensors, which are easy to fabricate and versatile for the detection of a variety of analytes.

Three separate characteristic temperatures at 86, 69, and 67 K are associated with magnetic phases in the K-Ni-Cr shell. Two magnetic exchange paths are identified. One propagates along the three crystallographic axis directions. The other propagates along the [110] crystallographic direction for the associated Ni-Ni interactions, but not for Cr-Cr interactions. The severe Cr deficiency and the appearance of direct Ni-Ni exchange are used to understand the appearance of two separate transitions associated with magnetic ordering. A weak moment develops in the core at low temperature, corresponding to separate ordering of the Co-Fe PBA network.

TI Bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts enriched with single Fe atoms and

SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have stimulated extensive interests, but the slow reaction kinetics of oxygen reactions hinder their further development. Here a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst enriched with both single Fe atoms and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles is designed to mitigate this issue. Specifically, iron phthalocy-anine with single-atom Fe-N4 moiety is coupled with graphene by 7C-7C stacking interaction to accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharging, while NiFe-based Prussian blue analogue derived NiFe2O4 nanoparticles are anchored on graphene to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging. The catalyst shows a small overpotential difference of 0.72 V between OER potential at 10 mA cm-2 and ORR half-wave potential. When used as an oxygen electrode catalyst, the corresponding ZAB exhibits a large power density of 185 mW cm-2, a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.717 V at 5 mA cm-2, and outstanding dis-charge-charge durability without any decay after 1035 cycles. This work offers a new concept to design multifunctional catalysts and stimulates the development of ZABs.

TI Enhancing Efficiency of Low-Grade Heat Harvesting by Structural
   Vibration Entropy in Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycles
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The majority of waste-heat energy exists in the form of low-grade heat (<100 degrees C), which is immensely difficult to convert into usable energy using conventional energy-harvesting systems. Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles (TREC), which integrate battery and thermal-energy-harvesting functionalities, are considered an attractive system for low-grade heat harvesting. Herein, the role of structural vibration modes in enhancing the efficacy of TREC systems is investigated. How changes in bonding covalency, influenced by the number of structural water molecules, impact the vibration modes is analyzed. It is discovered that even small amounts of water molecules can induce the A(1g) stretching mode of cyanide ligands with strong structural vibration energy, which significantly contributes to a larger temperature coefficient (alpha) in a TREC system. Leveraging these insights, a highly efficient TREC system using a sodium-ion-based aqueous electrolyte is designed and implemented. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of TREC systems, offering a deeper understanding of the intrinsic properties of Prussian Blue analogs regulated by structural vibration modes. These insights open up new possibilities for enhancing the energy-harvesting capabilities of TREC systems.

TI Nickel-ruthenium nanoalloy encapsulated in mesoporous carbon as active
   electrocatalysts for highly efficient overall water splitting in
   alkaline solution
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB A nickel-ruthenium nanoalloy embedded within a mesoporous carbon matrix (NiO@RuO2@mC) is developed by calcinating NiNi Prussian blue analogue doped with trace Ru3+ in air atmosphere as an efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline medium. The produced NiO@RuO2@mC nanoparticles (NPs) display a loose porous structure, which can remarkably facilitate mass transfer and bubble diffusion during electrocatalysis. RuO2 NPs can tune the electronic structure of Ni and decrease charge-transfer resistance, further leading to fast electron transport and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities. The developed NiO@RuO2@mC catalyst demonstrates good stability, long-term durability, and excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction and promising hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium. For oxygen evolution reaction, the catalyst shows a low overpotential of 170 mV for obtaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1); for hydrogen evolution reaction, it shows an overpotential of -129 mV for delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 120 mV dec(-1). Consequently, when NiO@RuO2@mC catalyst is used as a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer for water splitting, a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.52 V.

   i>[Cr(CN)6]l•nH2O
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB A series of photomagnetic coordination polymer core-shell heterostructures, based on the light-switchable Prussian blue analogue RbaCob[Fe(CN)(6)](c)center dot mH(2)O (RbCoFe-PBA) as the core and the ferromagnetic KjNik[Cr(CN)(6)](l)center dot nH(2)O (KNiCr-PBA) as the shell, was studied using powder X-ray diffraction, down to 100 K, and magnetometry, down to 2 K, to investigate the influence of the shell thickness on light-induced magnetization changes and gain insight into the mechanism. The core material is known to undergo a charge-transfer induced spin transition (CTIST), and synchrotron powder diffraction was used to monitor structural changes in both the core and the shell associated with the thermally and optically induced CTIST of the core. Significant lattice contraction in the RbCoFe-PBA core upon cooling through the high-spin to the low-spin state transition near similar to 260 K induces strain on the KNiCr-PBA shells. This lattice strain in the shell can be relieved either by thermal cycling back to high temperature or by using light to access the metastable high-spin state of the core at low temperature. The different extents of strain in the KNiCr-PBA shell are reflected in low-temperature, low-field magnetization versus temperature data in the light and dark states. A broader magnetic transition at T-c approximate to 70 K in the dark state relative to the light state reflects the greater dispersion of nearest-neighbor contacts and exchange energies induced by the structural distortions of the strained state. Analyses for different shell thicknesses, coupled with high-field magnetization data, support a mechanism whereby the light-induced magnetization changes in the KNiCr-PBA shell are due to realignment of the local magnetic anisotropy as a result of the structural changes in the shell associated with the optical CTIST of the core. Through magnetization and structural analyses, the depth to which the properties of the shell are influenced by the core-shell architecture was estimated to be between 40 and 50 nm.

TI Thermodynamic and Kinetic Analyses of Ion Intercalation/Deintercalation
   Using Different Temperatures on NiHCF Electrodes for Battery Electrode
   Deionization
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Prussian blue analogues are used in electrochemical deionization due to their cation sorption capabilities and ion selectivity properties. Elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying intercalation/deintercalation is important for the development of ion-selective electrodes. We examined the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of nickel hexacyanoferrate electrodes by studying different temperatures effects on intercalation/deintercalation with monovalent ions (Li+, Na+, K+, and NH4+) relevant to battery electrode deionization applications. Higher temperatures reduced the interfacial charge transfer resistance and increased the diffusion coefficient of cations in the solid material. Ion transport in the solid material, rather than interfacial charge transfer, was found to be the rate-controlling step, as shown by higher activation energies for ion transport (e.g., 31 +/- 3 kJ/mol for K+) than for interfacial charge transfer (5 +/- 1 kJ/mol for K+). The largest increase in cation adsorption capacity with temperature was observed for NH4+ (28.1% from 15 to 75 degrees C) due to its smallest activation energy. These results indicate that ion hydration energy determines the intercalation potential and activation energies of ion transport in solid material control intercalation/deintercalation rate. Together with the endothermic behavior of deintercalation and exothermic behavior of intercalation, the higher operating temperature results in improvement of ion adsorption capacity depending on specific cations.

TI Etching and isolation technique for synthesis of CNTs-encapsulated
   NiSe2/CoSe2 for supercapacitor applications
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The microstructure of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) plays a pivotal role in determining their performance as electrode materials. Herein, CNTs encapsulating NiSe2/CoSe2 nanoparticles (CNT@NiCo-Se) are derived from Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue (Ni-Co PBA), and the CNTs possess smaller diameter and larger interlayer spacing due to the "etching and isolation technique" that is adopted to prevent the accumulation of Ni/Co in Ni-Co PBA during the calcination process. CNT@NiCo-Se exhibits a specific capacity of 105.1 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), which is 375 % higher than that obtained without isolation strategy, which resulted in the microstructure advantages of smaller diameter and larger interlayer spacing. The actual reason is that smaller diameter and larger interlayer spacing correspond to higher charge transfer density and increased the -OH binding energy (OHBE) according to density functional theory (DFT) calculation results. In addition, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device exhibits a high energy density of 46.3 Wh kg(-1) at 801 W kg(-1) and a high power density of 8000 W kg(-1) at an energy density of 12.0 Wh kg(-1), and the initial specific capacitance of 80.4 % can be maintained after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g(-1). More importantly, this work provides a novel strategy for microstructure adjustment of CNTs in the field of energy storage and conversion.

TI Endogenous Fe2+-activated nanomedicine to amplify ROS generation and
   in-situ response NIR-II photothermal therapy of tumor
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Endogenous activated nanomedicines have great potential in improving therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects in cancer therapy. Herein, a novel nanomedicine (CuHCF) was developed based on a mixed-metal (Cu2+/ Fe3+) Prussian blue analogue via a facile co-precipitation method, which could respond to the endogenous labile iron pool (LIP) achieving enhanced chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and in situ NIR-II photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor. Notably, the prepared CuHCF itself shows low Fenton catalytic activity, which however, is found to significantly amplify the generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) when exposed to the over-expressed Fe2+ in tumor region, since the intracellular Fe2+ triggers the redox cycles between Fe3+/Fe2+ and Cu2+/Cu+ of CuHCF. More interestingly, it is found that the CuHCF presents an obviously enhanced near-infrared absorption after reacting with Fe2+, enabling in situ hyperthermia under NIR-II (1064 nm) irradiation. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that a highly efficient synergistic therapy of CDT/PTT was achieved via a ferroptosis pathway when CuHCF was combined with the ferroptosis inducer erastin (ERA). Such an endogenous activated nanomedicine provides a promising paradigm to enhance specific CDT in synergy with in situ NIR-II PTT for precise cancer therapy.

SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The electrocatalytic activities of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have recently received much attention due to their robustness and efficiency. Considering that PBAs with hexacyanocobaltate building block stand forward among other PBAs, a systematic study on a family of metal hexacyanocobaltates is presented in this study. Metal hexacyanocobaltates (M = Co, Mn, Ni, and Fe) were prepared, characterized, and electrochemical studies were performed. A series of mixed-metal cobalt-iron hexacyanocobaltates has also been studied to determine the ideal composition of a metal hexacyanocobaltate for electrocatalytic water oxidation process. The overall study clearly indicates that cobalt hexacyanocobaltate exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity among all.

TI Synthesis of FeCo alloy encapsulated nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon:
   High catalytic activation and low metal ion leaching in microwave
   assisted Fenton reaction
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB As an efficient non-precious metal catalyst, FeCo alloy was widely used in various catalytic reactions. Owing to the organic pollution in ecosystem, it has attracted much attention in heterogeneous Fenton reaction. Unfortunately, their application was restricted by slow process and high leaching. To overcome these shortcomings simultaneously, herein, FeCo@nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon (NGC) core/shell composite was synthesized via one-step annealing Prussian blue analogue. In microwave assisted Fenton reaction (MAFR), malachite green (MG) degradation time was only 2.5 min, and the rate constant was 2.0 min(-1), about 20 times higher than heterogeneous Fenton reaction. Synergistic index was 3.88, meaning extra 288% of removal efficiency was yield in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)+MW+FeCo@NGC system. The effect of microwave-activation was divided into thermal effect and non-thermal effect. SO4 center dot- produced through thermal effect occupied 73% +/- 8% of total number. The contribution of thermal effect was estimated to be 65% +/- 7% for MG removal. Non-thermal effect was clarified by hotspots effect theory. Due to protection of NGC shell, Co3+/2+ leaching in composite was only one-tenth of pure FeCo. FeCo@NGC composite could be rapidly recycled due to ferromagnetic behavior with saturation magnetization of 98.7 emu/g. 89.3% of degradation efficiency was maintained after the 5th cycle.

TI Low-Cost, Safe, and Ultra-Long Cycle Life Zn-K Hybrid Ion Batteries
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are viewed as a promising energy storage system for large-scale applications thanks to the low cost and wide accessibility of Zn-based materials, the high theoretical capacity of Zn anode, and their high level of safety. However, the practical application of ZIBs is hindered by the rapid performance degradation. Herein, a Zn-K hybrid ion battery design is proposed using a high-quality Prussian blue cathode and a nonflammable Zn-K hybrid ion electrolyte. The electrochemical process is divided into two parts, with K+ insertion/extraction occurring at the cathode side and Zn2+ plating/stripping occurring at the anode side, which avoids structure destruction caused by Zn2+ insertion in the cathode. The non-flammable electrolyte not only ensures high safety but also effectively suppresses dendrite growth on the Zn anode. The hybrid cells demonstrate a high capacity of 151.0 mAh g(-1), a high voltage of 1.74 V (vs Zn2+/Zn), and an ultra-long cycle life of 15 000 cycles. Combining the nonflammable nature of the electrolyte, the abundance of raw materials, and good electrochemical performance, the Zn-K hybrid ion battery system promises a promising future for renewable energy storage applications.

TI A review on tunable multi-functional Prussian blue nanoparticles; their
   promising biological applications & future directions
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) are a unique class of nanomaterials that offer exceptional stability, biosafety, and biocompatibility. The synthesis, characteristics, and prospective implications of PBNPs and other cyanide-bridged coordination polymers have recently been studied at the nanoscale. The PBNPs offer extreme flexibility in that they can be synthesized in different types of nanostructures, such as spherical, core shells, cubes, and other structures by employing relatively easy methods with fine tunability. In addition, novel surface functionalization strategies act as precursors to develop techniques that find applications in drug delivery, im-aging and sensing, among several others. The current review aims to analyze and summarize the most promising techniques for PBNP synthesis, strategies for surface engineering, recent biological applications, and future prospects. Surface-engineered PBNPs are envisaged to have a substantial impact not just in bio-medicine but also in other domains like energy storage, water decontamination, recycling, and waste management. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the potential of PBNPs as key components in diagnostics, therapeutics, and its implications for further use.

TI Tunable resistance of MOFs films via an anion exchange strategy for
   advanced gas sensing
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Because of their ultra-high surface area, large porosity and excellent structural tailorability, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered as outstanding candidates among sensing materials for hazardous gas detection. However, most of MOFs-based sensing films show weak film adhesion and low conductivity due to the poor formation ability of MOFs films by traditional sensor fabrication methods as well as the intrinsic insulating character of these MOFs. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to directly grow robust gas-sensing films based on pristine MOFs arrays (ZIF-67 nanosheets) in-situ on the surface of ceramic substrates. To improve the conductivity of MOFs arrays, anion-exchange method is applied to couple Prussian blue analogue (PBA) on the surface of ZIF-67 arrays. Structural characterization revealed that this permutation reaction can significantly improve the conductivity of the MOF films while their sheet-like structures can be mainly remained. Benefiting from the robust structure and improved conductivity, the as-designed ZIF-67/PBA films exhibited superior sensing performances such as good reproducibility, high response value (Rg/Ra = 11.7), and fast response/recovery speed (5/182 s) towards triethylamine. This work provides a new strategy to fabricate MOFs gas sensors and paves a new way to modulate the conductivity of MOF films.

TI Interfacial Electronic Modification of Nickel Phosphide via Iron Doping:
   An Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Water/Seawater Splitting
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Seawater electrolysis is an innovative technique that can potentially transform hydrogen production and contribute to environmental redemption. However, the lack of good bifunctional electrocatalysts may hinder further development of this technology. Herein, nickel hydroxide nanosheets can be employed as a precursor to producing a 3D Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with a distinct dimensional structure. Nickel hydroxide nanosheets are formed within a nickel foam and undergo a reaction with potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]). The nickel hydroxide structure is sheets-like and well-preserved, containing a multitude of PBA nanocubes. Following phosphidation at 350 degrees C, the iron-doped nickel phosphide (Fe-doped Ni2P (1.0 mM) nanosheets) demonstrates remarkable potential as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for total water/seawater splitting. This electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in overall water splitting, achieving current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH at remarkably low voltages of 1.65 and 2.06 V, respectively. Additionally, its improved ability to resist corrosion and its hydrophilic surface makes it suitable for the seawater splitting process. The material can generate current densities of 100 to 500 mA cm-2 in seawater with 1.0 M KOH, resulting in voltages of 1.74 and 2.32 V. These outstanding results, together with its durability, indicate the material's strong potential for practical seawater electrolysis.
   3D self-supported iron-doped nickel phosphide (Fe-doped Ni2P (1.0 mM) nanosheets) arrays are synthesized on nickel foam by hydrothermal method followed by phosphorization, which serves as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water/seawater splitting. The self-supported Fe-doped Ni2P (1.0 mM) nanosheets electrocatalyst is extremely beneficial due to its high intrinsic activity, abundance of active sites, and better transfer coefficient. image

TI Degradation of sulfamethoxazole using peroxymonosulfate activated by
   self-sacrificed synthesized CoAl-LDH@CoFe-PBA nanosheet: Reactive oxygen
   species generation routes at acidic and alkaline pH
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Novel cobalt aluminum layered double hydroxide@cobalt aluminum Prussian blue analogs (CoAl-LDH@CoFePBA) nanosheet was synthesized via a self-sacrificed method from CoAl-LDH. The morphology and physicochemical properties characterization showed that CoAl-LDH@CoFe-PBA nanosheets were hexagon shape with diameter of 100 nm. Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation via CoAl-LDH@CoFe-PBA towards sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation was systematically examined. The catalytic system showed a satisfactory SMX degradation efficiency (over 80%) with the initial pH range of 3.0-9.0. In particular, only similar to 8 min was required to achieve 98% of SMX (40 mu M) degradation with 0.1 g/L CoAl-LDH@CoFe-PBA and 0.3 mM PMS. Besides, the underlying reaction mechanism and generation routes of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) with varied initial pH was explicated by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and quenching tests. The surface-bound (OH)-O-center dot and O-1(2) were responsible for SMX degradation at acidic pH, and O-1(2) was mainly produced from O-2(center dot-). At alkaline pH, SO4 center dot- and O-1(2) co-contributed to the degradation, while O-1(2) was generated from O-2(center dot-) and SO4 center dot-. Oxygen vacancy in the inner space of the catalyst was considered as key electron donors involved in O-2(center dot-) production. In addition, nine major degradation intermediates of SMX were identified and the possible degradation pathways were further proposed accordingly.

TI Fe-Co PBA/rGO interface strategy enabling fast Al 3+intercalation for
   stable aqueous Al-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Aqueous aluminum -ion batteries (AAIBs) have emerged as cost-effective and safe alternatives to lithium -ion batteries for storing energy. However, utilizing cathode materials like Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) to accommodate different metallic charge carriers faces challenges due to their low conductivity and slow redox kinetics. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Fe -Co PBA/rGO nanocomposite with a strong interfacial chemical coupling between Fe -Co PBA and rGO. By combining theoretical calculations with experimental analysis, we have identified the essential role of interfacial interactions in regulating the electronic state and diffusion barriers of Al 3 + within the Fe -Co PBA framework. Moreover, a three-dimensional structure that is tightly enclosed by ultrathin rGO sheets was successfully formed, ensuring excellent structural stability. Ex -situ XPS and XRD investigations have further clarified the electrochemical mechanism of the Fe -Co PBA/rGO cathode, revealing reversible redox reactions between Fe 2 + /Fe 3 + and Co 3 + /Co 2 + states during the insertion and extraction of Al 3 + . These inherent properties contribute to the remarkable cycling stability of the Fe -Co PBA/rGO cathode, achieving 66.7 mAh/g at 1 A/g after 1500 cycles, and high electrochemical reversibility. Additionally, we have successfully built a MoO 3 //Fe-Co PBA/rGO full battery with a capacity of 53.6 mAh/g over 2000 cycles at 1 A/g. This outcome further emphasizes its significant potential in electronic applications related to energy storage.

TI Effect of the external metal on the electrochemical behavior of
   M3[Co(CN)6]2 (M: Co, Ni, Cu, Zn),
   towards their use as anodes in potassium ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB A series of crystalline-cubic Prussian blue analogues (PBA) M-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) were straightforwardly synthesized via the coprecipitation method as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy. These transition metal hexacyanocobaltates show electrochemical activity related to reversible K-ion storage between 0.05-2.6 V vs K-o/K+, that makes them suitable as anode-materials in K-ion batteries. The non-steady open circuit potential (OCP) observed in cells containing Cu-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) and Zn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) electrodes suggests the presence of spontaneous redox reactions at the electrolyte/PBA interface, which leads to the loss of electrochemical activity with the time. On the other hand, the Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) and Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)] show extended -stability periods and multiple reduction/oxidation reactions which lead to the reversible charge storage mechanism. From an in-depth electrochemical study on the Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)-PBA, used as reference, an improvement on capacity retention is observed when the electrode is discharged at high negative potentials, 0.2 V vs K-o/K+, possibly due to the beneficial effect of a different electrochemical reaction on the PBA surface. The Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)-PBA does not follow this trend, suggesting a different kinetics for this reaction on the particle surface, avoiding to observe its favorable effect as in the case of the Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2). This is the first time that transition metal-modified hexacyanocobaltates are reported as anode materials for K-ion batteries; particularly the Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) PEA exhibits specific capacities as high as similar to 310 mA h g(-1 )in the first discharge making it a promising material for applications in novel energy-storage technologies as K-ion batteries.

TI In situ transformation of iron-group ternary metal oxides nanocubes from
   Co/Ni-PBA for high-performance supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Three kinds of Prussian blue analogues (Ni-Fe PBA, Co-Fe PBA, Co/Ni-Fe PBA) with similar cubic nanostructures have been synthesized simply by one-step solution-precipitation method. By utilizing simultaneous oxidative decomposition and crystal growth, iron-group metal oxides (NiO/Fe3O4, Co3O4/Fe3O4, NiO/Co3O4/Fe3O4) with porous nanocubic structures have been converted successfully in situ from precursors of PBAs. When evaluated as anode materials for supercapacitors, the mixed metal oxides with a porous cubic structure manifest high specific capacity. The specific capacitance of ternary metal oxides (NiO/Co3O4/Fe3O4) is 2.3 times that of NiO/Fe3O4 and 3.7 times that of Co3O4/Fe3O4. Besides, the ternary metal oxides exhibit high rate stability (retention up to 72% even at 20 A g(-1)) and long cycle performance. The improved electrochemical performance may owe to the synergistic effect of mixed-metal-oxide porous nanostructures, which accelerates electron transport and ion diffusion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Cobalt hexacyanoferrate as an effective cocatalyst boosting water
   oxidation on oxynitride TaON photocatalyst under visible light
SO JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY
AB Developing efficient cocatalysts that improve water oxidation on photocatalyst particles is highly desirable because water oxidation is the key process in artificial photosynthesis systems and represents the rate-determining step. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have recently attracted considerable attention as functional materials, including water oxidation (electro)catalysts, owing to their high controllability in various properties via cation and/or ligand substitutions. However, there are still only a few successful studies on the enhancement of water oxidation on particulate photocatalysts by modification with PBAs. Herein, we report the use of cobalt hexacyanoferrate (KxCo [Fe(CN)(6)]y.nH(2)O, denoted as CoHCF) as an effective cocatalyst on a visible-light-responsive oxynitride (TaON) photocatalyst for improving O-2 evolution in the presence of various electron acceptors. The loading of CoHCF nanoparticles on the TaON surface via a simple impregnation method clearly enhanced the O-2 evolution rate from a basic (pH 8) aqueous solution containing Ag+ as a sacrificial electron donor; the enhancement was comparable to that of the widely-studied cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOx(OH)(y)). Importantly, it was revealed that the CoHCF nanoparticles loaded on TaON are chemically stable even under acidic conditions with pH below 3, whereas conventional Co-based cocatalysts such as oxide (CoOx) and oxyhydroxide (CoOx(OH)(y)) are unstable in these conditions due to their dissolution and thereby lose their functions. Thus, the TaON modified with CoHCF cocatalysts exhibited higher O-2 evolution rates than unloaded one in acidic aqueous solutions in the presence of not only sacrificial electron acceptor (Ag+) but also reversible ones (Fe3+, IO3-) under visible light irradiation.

TI Manipulating Intermetallic Charge Transfer for Switchable External
   Stimulus-Enhanced Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Electrocatalytic processes involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) present a kinetic bottleneck due to the existence of linear-scaling relationships, which bind the energies of the different intermediates in the mechanism limiting optimization. Here, we offer a way to break these scaling relationships and enhance the electrocatalytic activity of a Co-Fe Prussian blue modified electrode in OER by applying external stimuli. Improvements of & AP;11 % and & AP;57 % were achieved under magnetic field (0.2 T) and light irradiation (100 mW cm(-2)), respectively, when working at fixed overpotential, & eta;=0.6 V at pH 7. The observed enhancements strongly tie in with the intermetallic charge transfer (IMCT) intensity between Fe and Co sites. Density Functional Theory simulations suggest that tuning the IMCT can lead to a change of the OER mechanism to an external stimuli-sensitive spin crossover-based pathway, which opens the way for switchable electrocatalytic devices.

TI Cation effect on the structure and properties of
   hexacyanometallates-based nanocomposites: Improving cathode performance
   in aqueous metal-ions batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Thin films of nanocomposites between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and three different hexacyanometallates (HCMs) - Prussian blue, ruthenium purple (RP) and cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCFe) - were synthesized with different cations: K+, Na+ and Li+. The effect of the cations in both the structure and properties of the HCMs was evaluated by several characterization techniques, showing that the nature of the cation is directly related to the size of the channels in the produced HCM structure, as well as to the defect content, the electrochemical behavior, the electrochemical stability and the strength of the interaction between the HCM and the CNTs. Due to the large hydrated radius, Li+ produced the more defective and less stable HCMs, while the HCM synthesized with Na+ had large porous and organized structure. All those factors deeply affect the performance of the different films when applied as cathodes for aqueous potassium-, sodium- and lithium-ion secondary battery, which depends on the relationship between the size of hydrated ion and the lattice of the HCM structure. The discharge profile and capacity for RP is reported by the first time. CoHCFe-based composites achieved capacities up to 150 mAh g(-1) at 0.67 A g(-1) rate, with retention of 90% after 2000 cycles.

   sodium-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB Developing sodium storage anode materials with high capacity and high rate capability is the primary challenge for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. This study presents sulfide nanoboxes with nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulation, specifically Fe0.6Co0.3Ni0.1S2@NC, as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its high electrical conductivity. The Fe0.6Co0.3Ni0.1S2@NC is manufactured using polydopamine-coated Prussian blue analogues as the precursor in a sulfidation-in-nanobox strategy. Experimental analysis suggests that the Fe0.6Co0.3Ni0.1S2 nanoparticles with conformal carbon layers are uniformly embedded in a three-dimensional, high-conductivity carbon shell to form Fe0.6Co0.3Ni0.1S2@NC. The anode material demonstrates a high capacity of up to 1000 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and delivers 390 mAh g-1 even at a high rate of 10 A g-1.

TI PBA-derived FeCo alloy with core-shell structure embedded in 2D N-doped
   ultrathin carbon sheets as a bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable
   Zn-air batteries
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY
AB To overcome slow kinetics of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER), the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts remains a huge challenge. FeCo alloy as an active-species usually suffers from its poor catalytic stability by easy corrosion. Here, we synthesize a core (FeCo)-shell (carbon) alloy anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon-nanosheets (FeCo/NUCSs) via a self-growth strategy. FeCo/NUCSs (140 m2 g-1) exhibits promising half-wave potential (E1/2 =0.89 V) and methanol tolerance for ORR. Prussian blue analog-derived carbon shell protects binary active-sites (Fe-Nx/Co-Nx) on FeCo core to stabilize ORR activity. FeCo/NUCSs also displays a higher OER activity (overpotential of 300 mV) than RuO2, due to generation of highly-active FeOOH/CoOOH species on FeCo alloys as indicated by in situ X-ray diffraction. Assembled Zn-air battery (ZAB) exhibits promising open-circuit voltage of 1.51 V, specific capacity of 791.86 mA h g-1, and durability (102 h). This novel bimetallic alloy-based catalyst provides an interesting option for design of durable oxygen-electrocatalysts for ZAB.

SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB Prussian whites (PWs) with a three-dimensional framework can accommodate the insertion and extraction of ions with large radius, which have been widely used in potassium ion batteries. However, PWs show the poor cycling performance and inferior rate ability because of high coordinated water. In this work, PWs with different water content were synthesized via a coprecipitation method by controlling the reaction temperature. The sample with low-coordination water prohibits the best electrochemical performance. It shows a high capacity of 120.5 mAh/g at 100 mA/g for potassium-ion batteries (KIBs). It also exhibits a good rate performance, displaying a capacity of 73.2 mAh/g at 500 mA/g. (c) 2021 Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

TI Design of Trimetallic NiMoFe Hollow Microspheres with
   Polyoxometalate-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen
   Evolution Reaction
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Design of efficient and inexpensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is the key to realizing the wide application of water electrolysis in industrial production. Herein, we synthesized trimetallic hollow microspheres composed with FeNi nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon-based Ni2Mo3N (NiMoFe@NC700) using a "PBA@POMOF" strategy. In order to synthesize the precursor with ideal morphology and structure in the least steps, a polyoxometalate based metal-organic framework (POMOF) is used as a substrate to grow a Ni-Fe-based Prussian blue analogue (NiFePBA) on it. Benefiting from the hollow sphere structure formed by stacking flakes, better charge transfer performance and the synergistic effect between Ni2Mo3N and Fe0.64Ni0.36, the final product, NiMoFe@NC700, exhibits low overpotentials of 288 and 360 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) for OER in 1 M KOH, respectively, which is superior to the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. This work proposes a facile and effective strategy to synthetize carbon-based polymetallic OER electrocatalysts based on PBA@POMOF.

TI Visible light-assisted S-doped red mud-based Fe-Co PBA derivatives
   activated PMS for efficient degradation of oxytetracycline from acidic
   to alkaline conditions: Degradation mechanism, degradation pathways and
   toxicity evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Building an economically efficient, adaptable, and environmentally friendly advanced oxidation system is crucial for the treatment of antibiotic wastewater. In this study, we prepared a sulfur-doped red mud (RM) based Fe-Co Prussian blue analog derivative material (SRPD) using solid waste RM. Due to the doping of sulfur, SRPD possessed more abundant active sites (Co2+/Fe2+) and superior photocatalytic performance compared to other materials. Therefore, the SRPD/peroxymonosulfate (PMS)/Vis system exhibited the best degradation performance for oxytetracycline (OTC), with good reusability, resistance to impurity anions, adaptability to different water qualities, no secondary pollution, and maintained excellent performance under acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions. Analysis has shown that the participation of surface S 2- species in active sites regeneration was an important reason for achieving satisfactory degradation efficiency under neutral and alkaline conditions. In addition, there were significant differences in the charge transfer ability, surface morphology, and surface composition of SRPD in different pH systems, which affected the amount and types of main reactive oxygen species generated by PMS activation. As a result, the degradation pathways of OTC in SRPD/PMS/Vis systems with different pH values were somewhat different, but the detoxification ability towards OTC was excellent. This study exhibits certain reference significance for improving the degradation performance under neutral and alkaline conditions, and is an excellent candidate system for practical wastewater treatment.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB In this study, we employed Na2CoFe(CN)(6) (CoHCF), which was synthesized by a commonly used co-precipitation method, as the cathode material for aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs). By adding an electrolyte additive (1wt% CoSO4) in the aqueous electrolyte (1 M Na2SO4), the framework structures were stabilized and the cycle stability was significantly improved (100% capacity retention at a current density of 2C (1C = 120 mA g(-1))) after 100 cycles without affecting the initial reversible capacity. Long-term cycle tests (2000 cycles) at current densities of 10C and 20C were also performed and indicated similar improvement. The XRD, FT-IR, and ICP-AES results demonstrated that better structure maintenance of the CoHCF framework can be realized when Co2+ ions were added. We suggest that such a simple method can be extended to all PBAs to improve the overall performance of SIBs effectively.

TI Na1.51Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.87•1.83H2
   O Hollow Nanospheres via Non-Aqueous Ball-Milling Route to Achieve High
   Initial Coulombic Efficiency and High Rate Capability in Sodium-Ion
   Batteries
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted extensive attention as cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost, high theoretical capacity, and facile synthesis process. However, it is of great challenge to control the crystal vacancies and interstitial water formed during the aqueous co-precipitation method, which are also the key factors in determining the electrochemical performance. Herein, an antioxidant and chelating agent co-assisted non-aqueous ball-milling method to generate highly-crystallized Na2-xFe[Fe(CN)(6)](y) with hollow structure is proposed by suppressing the speed and space of crystal growth. The as-prepared Na2-xFe[Fe(CN)(6)](y) hollow nanospheres show low vacancies and interstitial water content, leading to a high sodium content. As a result, the Na-rich Na1.51Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.87)center dot 1.83H(2)O hollow nanospheres exhibit a high initial Coulombic efficiency, excellent cycling stability, and rate performance via a highly reversible two-phase transition reaction confirmed by in situ X-ray diffraction. It delivers a specific capacity of 124.2 mAh g(-1) at 17 mA g(-)1 , presenting ultra-high rate capability (84.1 mAh g(-1) at 3400 mA g(-1)) and cycling stability (65.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 170 mA g(-1)). Furthermore, the as-reported non-aqueous ball-milling method could be regarded as a promising method for the scalable production of PBAs as cathode materials for high-performance SIBs.

TI Construction of composite separator with 3D hierarchical spinel
   structure in Lithium-Sulfur batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered the most promising candidate for achieving a low-cost highenergy-density system. One of the biggest deterrents during the practical application of Li-S batteries is the shuttle effect which causes fast capacity degradation and poor rate performance. 3D CoNi2S4 with 3D interconnected porous nitrogen doping carbon was prepared by sulfurizing the precursor Prussian blue analogues. The CoNi2S4 nanoparticles are confined in the carbon framework, affording interconnected macro-mesoporous channels. The constructed 3D CoNi2S4 modified separator effectively accommodates enough electrolytes and provides more exposed active sites that suppress the shuttle effect through trapping polysulfides and accelerating the lithiation of S8 to Li2S. Thus, Li-S batteries with 3D CoNi2S4-PP separators exhibit high-rate capacity and remarkable cycle stability. Furthermore, based on the modified separators, a high sulfur loading cathode delivers an areal capacity of 5.62 mAh cm- 2. The separator size expands further to assemble the 1Ah Li-S pouch cell, confirming the practicality. This work provides an efficient strategy with a modified separator for highperformance Li-S batteries.

TI Nanoprotection Against Retinal Pigment Epithelium Degeneration via
   Ferroptosis Inhibition
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Lethal oxidative stress and ferrous ion accumulation-mediated degeneration/death in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) exert an indispensable impact on retinal degenerative diseases with irreversible visual impairment, especially in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but corresponding pathogenesis-oriented medical intervention remains controversial. In this study, the potent iron-binding nanoscale Prussian blue analogue KCa[Fe-III(CN)(6)] (CaPB) with high biocompatibility is designed to inhibit RPE death and subsequently photoreceptor cell degeneration. In mice, CaPB effectively prevents RPE degeneration and ultimately fulfills superior therapeutic outcomes upon a single intravitreal injection: significant rescue of retinal structures and visual function. Through high-throughput RNA sequencing and sophisticated biochemistry evaluations, the findings initially unveil that CaPB nanoparticles protect against RPE degradation by inhibiting ferroptotic cell fate. Together with the facile, large-scale preparations and in vivo biosafety, it is believed that the synthesized CaPB therapeutic nanoparticles are promising for future clinical treatment of diverse retinal diseases involving pathological iron-dependent ferroptosis, including AMD.

TI Metal-Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives: Designing Principles and
   Advances toward Advanced Cathode Materials for Alkali Metal Ion
   Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives have attracted enormous attention in the field of energy storage, due to their high specific surface area, tunable structure, highly ordered pores, and uniform metal sites. Compared with the wide research of MOFs and their related materials on anode materials for alkali metal ion batteries, few works are on cathode materials. In this review, design principles for promoting the electrochemical performance of MOF-related materials in terms of component/structure design, composite fabrication, and morphology engineering are presented. By summarizing the advancement of MOFs and their derivatives, Prussian blue and its analogs, and MOF surface coating, challenges and opportunities for future outlooks of MOF-related cathode materials are discussed.

TI Surface passivation of NaxFe[Fe(CN)6] cathode to
   improve its electrochemical kinetics and stability in sodium-ion
   batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are considered as promising cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries. However, PBAs usually suffer from low electrical conductivity and high humid sensitivity, which results in the poor electrochemical kinetics and stability. In this work, a passivation strategy is proposed to solve these problems. The sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (PB) passivated by acetate ligands exhibits significantly improved electrochemical kinetics. It delivers a specific capacity of 128 mAh g(-1) at 25 mA g(-1). Even at 2 A g(-1), the capacity still retains 94.6 mAh g(-1). Most impressively, the passivated PB can maintain excellent electrochemical stability when exposed in the humid air for 7 days. Further investigations show that the strong physical interaction between the acetate ligands and the exposed Fe atoms can inhibit the readsorption of water and induce the electron transfer between low spin Fe and high spin Fe in PB. Thus, the surface passivation can efficiently enhance the electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability of PB.

TI Scattering techniques to probe the templating effect in the synthesis of
   copper hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles via reverse microemulsions
SO COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB The formation of nanoparticles (NPs) by means of reverse microemulsions results in generally homogeneous shapes with fairly narrow size distributions. We report here a study of the behaviour of the microemulsion (NaAOT/Isooctane/water) during the formation of copper hexacyanoferrate NPs inside water nanodroplets (CuPBA for Prussian Blue Analogous). Small angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS) provide additional information on the size, shape and interaction between the micelles. SAXS shows that as soon as CuPBA NPs are present in the system, long-range interactions occur between the micelles, even for the smallest amount of NPs. On the other hand, the SANS matching technique allows to consider only the diffusion of the NPs by deactivating the diffusion of the rest of the system. The size of the NPs found with SANS is in agreement with TEM observations for intermediate contents of aqueous phase in the microemulsion (5.1 +/- 0.9 nm for w = 10). Finally, FTIR and XRD confirm the formation of CuPBA networks. Moreover, TEM shows that the size of the NPs is in agreement with the radius of the nanodroplets given by SAXS, except for a higher water content where the system is closer to destabilisation, thus producing larger NPs with a wide size distribution (13.6 +/- 4.6 nm for w = 20) compared to the droplet radius.

TI Zn<SUP>2+</SUP> Induced Phase Transformation of
   K2MnFe(CN)6 Boosts Highly Stable Zinc-Ion Storage
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), featuring an open framework for accommodating large ions and tunable valence states, have garnered wide interest in the context of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). However, PBAs in ZIBs currently still suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to structural instability. Here a K2MnFe(CN)(6) cathode achieving a very stable capacity of 100 mAh g(-1) is reported in a ZIB charged/discharged to 400 cycles. Interestingly, such a stable capacity is attributed to the fact that the K2MnFe(CN)(6) cathode is gradually transformed to rhombohedral K2Zn3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), a process that is induced by Zn2+ insertion. The mechanism of the phase transformation is further investigated through ab initio calculations and detailed characterizations. The inserted Zn2+ is found to induce an intense Jahn-Teller effect of the trivalent manganese, resulting in a strong lattice distortion. Coupled with the disproportionation reaction of manganese, the MnN6 octahedra are replaced by ZnN4 tetrahedra and produce the new K2Zn3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) phase eventually. The robust structure of the resulting K2Zn3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) phase contains wider channels for accommodating divalent ions and thus enables highly stable and reversible storage of Zn2+ ions. The findings of this work lead to a new understanding on the evolution of PBAs in ZIBs, and provide a promising cathode material.

TI Facile synthesis of Co, N enriched carbon nanotube and active site
   identifications for bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution
   catalysis
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB The carbon-based electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air battery not only needs bifunctional activities to oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, but also requires a high graphitization degree to maintain an excellent stability. Herein, a simple and scale-up strategy is developed to synthesize a highly active and stable electrocatalyst (Co@N-CNT) through a solid-state thermal conversion process, derived from a single and easy-to-get precursor (cobaltic Prussian blue analogue). The Co particles trapped inside the tips are the growth sites of the carbon nanotubes and greatly improve the catalytic activity. This kind of special structure helps Co@N-CNT to achieve remarkable bifunctional activities comparable to the noble metal counterparts and superior durability. Interestingly, Co@N-CNT is proved to have no single-atom Co sites on the carbon nanotube. In combination with electrochemical tests, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, Co@graphitic N-C is considered to be the best ORR active site while Co@pyridinic N-C is the best OER active site.

TI Zero-Strain Sodium Nickel Ferrocyanide as Cathode Material for
   Sodium-Ion Batteries with Ultra-Long Lifespan
SO SMALL
AB Prussian blue analogues are recognized as one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to the open 3D framework structure with large interstitial sites and developed Na-ion diffusion channels. However, high content of anion vacancy and poor structural stability have hampered the prospect of their application. In this work, sodium nickel ferrocyanide (Na1.34Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.92, NNHCF) is proposed as cathode material for SIBs. N-coordinated Ni-ion can boost NNHCF to possess less Fe[(CN)6]4- defect, low Na-ion migration barrier, and more negative formation energy compared with Na0.91Cu[Fe(CN)6]0.77 (NCHCF), thus exhibiting more active sites, fast electrochemical kinetics behavior and great structure stability. It is confirmed that NNHCF undergoes a solid solution mechanism without phase evolution for reversible Na-ion intercalation/deintercalation, employing Fe associated with C atom as redox center for charge compensation. Therefore, NNHCF contributes a high initial energy density of 180.94 Wh<middle dot>g-1 at 10 mA<middle dot>g-1, excellent rate capability, superior cycling stability with ultra-long lifespan of 13 000 cycles, and low fading rate of 0.0027% per cycle at 500 mA<middle dot>g-1. This work sheds light on the construction of low-defect PBA cathodes with outstanding dynamics and stability.

TI Recent progress in transition metal hexacyanometallates: From structure
   to properties and functionality
SO COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB The coordination chemistry of transition metal hexacyanometallates is a field of continuous advances and emerging applications. In the last three decades, relevant progress has been achieved on the understanding of the crystal and electronic structures of these materials, including those compositions resulting from non-conventional preparative routes. In this review, we summarize such advances at the time that provide a comprehensive overview of the structure-properties relationship. Since an improvement of the functionality of a given material is facilitated when its crystal and electronic structures are known, we provide guidelines on how to understand and predict the properties of these coordination polymers. In this family of materials, the extended 3D framework is usually formed by interconnected center dot center dot center dot-T-N equivalent to C-M-C equivalent to N-T-center dot center dot center dot chains. When these chains have a linear geometry, the formed solids crystallize either with a cubic or pseudocubic unit cell, and these coordination polymers are known as Prussian blue analogs. In the last years, deviations from such regularity have been observed for an increasing number of T metals, where the N end of the CN- ligand forms a bifurcated coordination bonding with two T metal centers. Other less common coordination modes at the N end have been also documented and are herein considered. Since the first documented report on this family of coordination polymers (in 1704), a search of published documents, using Science Finder and Google Scholar under the keywords of Prussian blue and transition metal hexacyanometallates, produces above four thousand outputs, mainly scientific papers. But these papers mostly deal with potential applications, and only a small fraction of them includes structural studies in the context of coordination chemistry. This review is structured in three blocks of sections. Initially, the crystal and electronic structures are discussed, then, the related physical properties are analyzed, and finally, their implications on the applications, with the focus on the structure-properties relationship are discussed. The accompanying Supplementary Data file has been conceived as a source of useful structural information, which together with the main document will help the readers to understand better these compounds and devise new and promising applications.

TI CoCl2 encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon hollow cubic nanobox
   enabling long-life and high-rate lithium storage
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The poor cycling stability and inferior rate performance impede the application of CoCl2 in lithium-ion batteries. Herein, Prussian blue analogs (Co3[Co(CN)6]2, Co-Co PBA) microcubes are coated by a layer of polydopamine (PDA). Through carbonization and chlorination, Co-Co PBA@PDA is decomposed into CoCl2 2H2O and CoCl2 6H2O encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon hollow cubic nanoboxes. The closed independent carbon nanobox, strong coupling effect between carbon nanobox and CoCl2, high electron-conductive and Li+-diffusive wall of the carbon nanoboxes, and large hollow interior space bring about superior lithium storage performance through their synergy. As an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the composite can deliver considerable discharge capacity of 406 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 1500 cycles, presenting excellent cycling performance. The average discharge capacities at 0.1 and 10 A g-1 can reach 1282 and 123 mAh g-1, respectively, which exhibits high electrochemical activity and outstanding rate capability. Electrochemical kinetics analyses in combination with ex-situ material characterization demonstrate that a certain proportion of surface capacitive behavior occurs in electrochemical reaction. The diffusion of Li ions is rapid and stable. The reaction impedance is low. The composite is of good structural integrity during cycling. This work provides a significant exploration for development of high-performance transition metal chlorides in lithium-ion batteries.

TI Prussian Blue Nanocubes with an Open Framework Structure Coated with
   PEDOT as High-Capacity Cathodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB It is shown that Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) can be a very competitive sulfur host for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Sulfur stored in the large interstitial sites of a PBA host can take advantage of reversible and efficient insertion/extraction of both Li+ and electrons, due to the well-trapped mobile dielectron redox centers in the well-defined host. It is demonstrated that Na2Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] has a large open framework, and as a cathode, it both stores sulfur and acts as a polysulfide diffusion inhibitor based on the Lewis acid-base bonding effect. The electrochemical testing shows that the S@Na2Fe[Fe(CN)(6)]@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) composite achieves excellent reversibility, good stability, and fast kinetics. Its outstanding electrochemical properties should be ascribed to the internal transport of Li+/e-, maximizing the utilization of sulfur. Moreover, the open metal centers serve as the Lewis acid sites with high affinity to the negatively charged polysulfide anions, reducing the diffusion of polysulfides out of the cathode and minimizing the shuttling effect. The fundamental basis of these exceptional performance characteristics is explored through a detailed analysis of the structural and electrochemical behavior of the material. It is believed that the PBAs will have a useful role in ensuring more effective and stable Li-S batteries.

TI Co3+-rich CoFe-PBA encapsulated in ultrathin MoS2 sheath as integrated
   core-shell architectures for highly efficient OER
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is the key component of sustain-able water splitting reaction. Controllable core-shell engineering is one of the most effective strategies for modulating the local electronic structure of active sites to enhance catalytic activity. Herein, we design a nano-cube of Co3+-rich CoFe Prussian blue analogues coated with controllable MoS2 shell heterostructures as OER electrocatalyst by simple solvothermal method, named as CoIIIFe-PBA/MoS2. Importantly, CoIIIFe-PBA/MoS2 possesses an extremely low overpotential of 306 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 36.2 mV dec-1 and excellent stability for OER. The results of spectroscopic character-izations reveal that the Co3+ species with more 3d electron orbits origin from the charge transfer between CoFe-PBA and MoS2 core-shell interface, which promotes the electron accepting and results in the higher electrochemical activity. This research offers unique insight to design other advanced electrocatalysts with high-valent transition metal ions and core-shell structure. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Energy band engineering over NiFe-PBA-S/graphdiyne of S-scheme
   heterojunction for enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution technology faces great challenges in designing efficient and stable photocatalysis. Adjusting the energy band structure of photocatalyst is one of the means to design efficient and stable photocatalyst. In this work, the bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) was sulfurized. It is worth noting that the process of vulcanizing NiFe-PBA (NF) into NiFe-PBA-S (NFS) has an adjustment effect on the energy band structure. NFS and graphdiyne (GDY) are combined to form NFS/GDY composite catalyst with S-scheme heterojunction, NFS/GDY has the best photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 2847.86 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). The analysis of XPS test, in-situ XPS test and Mott-Schottky test further shows that the regulation of energy band structure accelerate the electron transport and provide sufficient active sites of surface. This work offers a useful approach for developing photocatalyst of energy band engineering to enhance the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

TI OCNTs encapsulating Fe-Co PBA as efficient chainmail-like
   electrocatalyst for enhanced heterogeneous electro-Fenton reaction
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Preparing heterogeneous electro-Fenton (HEF) catalysts without sacrificing activity towards the two-electron (2e(-)) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a challenge, since Fenton-like active sites consist mainly of transition metals that prefer the 4e(-) ORR pathway. In this study, oxidized carbon nanotubes (OCNTs), which are promising ORR catalysts for the 2e(-) ORR, were uniformly attached to the surface of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) microcubes, forming a unique chainmail-like catalyst (OCNTs/PBA). 50 mg/L of sulfamethazine (SMZ) was completely removed within 30 min over OCNTs/PBA HEF process, with the first-order kinetic constant increased by 287.2 % compared with that PBA alone. To reveal the mechanism behind the enhanced catalytic activity, several possible interactions between the OCNTs and PBA were proposed and investigated further. This study not only offers a facile method to prepare a chainmail-like HEF catalyst, but also provides valuable insights into the rational design of HEF electrocatalysts with dual Fenton-like and ORR activity.

TI Reverse Dual-Ion Battery Enabled by Reversing the Cation/Anion Storage
   Mechanism in an Aqueous ZnCl2 Water-in-Salt Electrolyte
SO CHEMPHYSCHEM
AB Dual ion batteries (DIBs) have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their unique ability to store charges using electrolyte-born ions, making them promising candidates for grid storage applications. However, despite extensive efforts to explore DIBs with various electrolytes, such as organic, aqueous, gel polymer etc., challenges such as electrolyte decomposition and poor stability of anode materials in aqueous electrolytes remain unresolved. To address these issues, we report a novel approach utilizing a flip-cum-reverse sequence of anion/cation storage chemistry in a ZnCl2 water-in-salt electrolyte (ZnCl2-WiSE)-based reverse dual ion battery (RDIB), employing Zn-based Prussian blue analogue i. e., Zn-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) and ferrocene-carbon composite (FcC) as cathode and anode electrodes, respectively. The RDIB operates in the opposite direction compared to conventional DIBs, offering a fresh perspective. Through our investigations, we discovered that increasing the concentration of ZnCl2-WiSE [ZnCl2-WiSE] resulted in a positive shift of 270 mV in the redox potential for cation/anion (de)insertion at the cathode, and a negative shift of 70 mV at the anode, indicating enhanced performance. Remarkably, the RDIB operate in 10 m ZnCl2-WiSE exhibited an impressive energy density of 23 Wh kg(-1), showcasing the potential of this approach for high-performance energy storage.

TI Enhanced dispersion of prussian blue via intercalation into
   layered double hydroxides for efficient solar seawater evaporation
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Prussian blue (PB) is favored for its photothermal absorption capability in solar vapor generation applications. However, the photothermal conversion efficiency of current PB-based devices is limited by the material's poor dispersion. Herein, we report a method of incorporating PB in the interlayers of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to prevent its aggregation. The dispersion is further enhanced and stabilized by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The thermal and water stability of PB is improved due to the rigid structure of LDHs and interactions between layers and anions. Elemental analysis confirms that with the increase of molar ratio of Mg/Al and the introduction of SDS, concentrations of PB are decreased accordingly. As a result, the rate of solar vapor generation is increased by 35.9% for powders containing 50 mg of equivalent PB. Of note, converting this material into a three-dimensional structure of high rebound foam further enhances solar water evaporation rate, from 0.79 kg m(-2) h(-1) to 0.98 kg m(-2) h(-1), with only 20 mg of equivalent PB, increasing the corresponding photothermal conversion efficiency from 53.8% to 66.3%.

TI La-doped FeNiSe4/Fe0.8Ni0.2Se2/NF heterostructure for superior oxygen
   evolution reaction
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB It is of great value to explore non-noble and highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to obtain reproducible and clean fuels. In this work, a novel La-doped FeNiSe4/Fe0.8Ni0.2Se2/NF (La-FeNi-Se/NF) heterostructure catalyst was prepared by a facile selenization treatment to La-doped FeNi Prussian blue analogue (PBA) in-situ grown on foam nickel (NF). The catalytic performance of La-FeNi-Se/NF was significantly enhanced by the doped La3+. As a result, the optimized La-FeNi-Se-2/NF exhibits superior alkaline OER electrocatalytic activity (overpotential 158 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope 35.6 mV dec-1) than FeNi-Se/NF and Ln-FeNi-Se/ NF (Ln = Ce, Gd, Yb), and most reported FeNi-based OER electrocatalysts. The excellent electrocatalytic capa-bility to OER is attributed to the doping FeNi-Se heterostructure with a suitable amount La3+. Also, the unique La-FeNi-Se-2/NF flower-like structure composed of nanograins can produce abundant active sites and enhance charge transfer, thereby further improving the catalytic performance. This work highlights an effective chemical and engineering method to prepare efficient electrochemical catalysts.

SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Here we report a facile strategy to synthesize porous FexCo3-xO4 nanocages by heating Prussian blue analogues FeyCo1-y[Co(CN)(6)](0.67)(center dot)nH(2)0 nanospheres with tunable size and morphology. The iron doping amount had significant influence on the final morphology and the most uniform nanocages were obtained from x = 0.8. The catalytic performance of the nanocages was thoroughly evaluated by activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for removal of bisphenol A (BPA) in water. The influence of different process parameter on the BPA degradation efficiency was examined and the catalytic stability was tested. The BPA degradation pathway was proposed based on GC-MS and LC-MS results. The involved radicals were identified through radical scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mossbauer and XPS techniques were applied to illustrate the catalytic mechanism and B-site Coll on the surface of FexCo3-xO4 nanocages was determined as the main factor for PMS activation. Results indicate that porous FexCo3-xO4 nanocages are available to serve as alternative environmentally friendly catalysts for pollutants removal by activation of PMS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI On the Activity and Selectivity of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural
   Electrocatalytic Oxidation over Cation-Defective Nickel Hydroxides
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB Electrocatalytic oxidation as a promising route to produce value-added products from biomass-derived organics has received increasing attention in recent years. However, the efficient conversion of concentrated feedstock solutions with high selectivity and Faradaic efficiency (FE) remains challenging. Herein, we report a cation-defective Ni-based electrocatalyst derived from the surface reconstruction of the NiCo Prussian blue analogue (NiCo PBA) in alkaline media for the efficient oxidation of biomass-derived organics in a high concentration solution. Taking 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as an example, the NiCo PBA can deliver a satisfactory catalytic performance in terms of high HMF conversion (97%), selectivity to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (98%), and FE (100%), even at a concentration as high as 100 mM. Theoretical calculations suggest that the cation defects not only promote the fast conversion of Ni(OH)(2) to electrochemically active NiOOH under anodic potential but also enhance the adsorption of HMF onto the active sites and accelerate the spontaneous chemical oxidation. This study provides deep insights into the structural evolution of PBA-based catalysts and reveals the pivotal factor that affects the performance of electrocatalytic oxidation, paving the way to further develop advanced electrocatalysts for efficient oxidation reactions with a high concentration.

TI Different Growth Behavior of MOF-on-MOF Heterostructures to Enhance
   Oxygen Evolution
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB The exploration of non-noble metal electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has become particularly urgent. Here, FeNi-based Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) were obtained by adding different solvents, where PBA particles preferentially grew on the surface plane/edge of coordination polymer precursor (Ni-ABDC) with various polarities. This resulted in the formation of FeNi-PBA-plane/edge morphologies, respectively. Notably, on account of more exposed PBAs, FeNi nanoparticles were uniformly supported on the porous N-doped carbon nanomaterials. Among them, the calcined FeNi-NC-800 underwent an interesting pre-activation process and exhibited a low overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 m KOH. This bimetallic sample showed superior OER activity and stability in comparison with control materials, which could be attributed to its abundant FeNi nanoparticles, high nitrogen content, large specific surface area, and synergistic effects between Fe and Ni atoms. In addition, relevant theoretical calculation on the optimal catalyst, FeNi-NC-800, further demonstrated its efficient OER performance with effective Fe-doping in the Ni-based oxyhydroxides.

TI Enabling nickel ferrocyanide nanoparticles for high-performance ammonium
   ion storage
SO FRONTIERS OF CHEMICAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Prussian blue and its analogs are extensively investigated as a cathode for ammonium-ion batteries. However, they often suffer from poor electronic conductivity. Here, we report a Ni2Fe(CN)(6)/multiwalled carbon nanotube composite electrode material, which is prepared using a simple coprecipitation approach. The obtained material consists of nanoparticles with sizes 30-50 nm and the multiwalled carbon nanotube embedded in it. The existence of multiwalled carbon nanotube ensures that the Ni2Fe(CN)(6)/multiwalled carbon nanotube composite shows excellent electrochemical performance, achieving a discharge capacity of 55.1 mAh.g(-1) at 1 C and 43.2 mAh.g(-1) even at 15 C. An increase in the ammonium-ion diffusion coefficient and ionic/electron conductivity based on kinetic investigations accounts for their high performance. Furthermore, detailed ex situ characterizations demonstrate that Ni2Fe(CN)(6)/multiwalled carbon nanotube composite offers three advantages: negligible lattice expansion during cycling, stable structure, and the reversible redox couple. Therefore, the Ni2Fe(CN)(6)/multiwalled carbon nanotube composite presents a long cycling life and high rate capacity. Finally, our study reports a desirable material for ammonium-ion batteries and provides a practical approach for improving the electrochemical performance of Prussian blue and its analogs.

SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB Rechargeable Li-CO2 batteries, which utilize CO2 into electrochemical energy storage systems, provide a promising strategy for alleviating the greenhouse effect and developing high energy density second batteries. However, problems such as poor battery performance and short cycle life still hinder the development of Li-CO2 batteries. In this work, a novel three-dimensional free-standing NiFe@NC/PPC cathode is prepared by depositing NiFe-Prussian blue analogues on the surface of pomelo peels (PP) and subsequently calcining at high temperature. The products fully retained the three dimensional porous characteristic of biomass, conducing to mass transfer and diffusion. In addition, the high catalytic activity of NiFe@NC is carried forward. Combined with these two advantages, the Li-CO2 battery with NiFe@NC/PPC cathode exhibits a superior discharge capacity of 6.8 mA h cm(-2) and can sustain 109 cycles with a cutoff capacity of 0.25 mA h cm(-2) at a current density of 0.05 mA cm(-2). Overall, this study provides a promising way for the fabrication of environmentally friendly and inexpensive cathodes to improve the performance of Li-CO2 batteries.

TI A Co-Reactive Immunosensor Based on Ti3C2T
   x  MXene@TiO2-MoS2 Hybrids Promoting
   luminol@Au@Ni-Co NCs Electrochemiluminescence for CYFRA 21-1 Detection
SO ACS SENSORS
AB The construction of assays is capable of accurately detecting cytokeratin-19 (CYFRA 21-1), which is critical for the rapid diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer. In this work, a novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor based on the co-reaction promotion of luminol@Au@Ni-Co nanocages (NCs) as ECL probe by Ti3C2Tx MXene@TiO2-MoS2 hybrids as co-reaction accelerator was proposed to detect CYFRA 21-1. Ni-Co NCs, as a derivative of Prussian blue analogs, can be loaded with large quantities of Au NPs, luminol, and CYFRA 21-1 secondary antibodies due to their high specific surface area. To further improve the sensitivity of the developed ECL immunosensor, Ti3C2Tx MXene@TiO2-MoS2 hybrids were prepared by in situ growth of TiO2 nanosheets on highly conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene, and MoS2 was homogeneously grown on Ti3C2Tx MXene@TiO2 surfaces by the hydrothermal method. Ti3C2Tx MXene@TiO2-MoS2 hybrids possess excellent catalytic performance on the electro-redox of H2O2 generating more O-2(<middle dot>-) and obtaining optimal ECL intensity of the luminol/H2O2 system. Under the appropriate experimental conditions, the quantitative detection range of CYFRA 21-1 was from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1), and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.046 pg mL(-1). The present sensor has a lower LOD with a wider linear range, which provides a new analytical assay for the early diagnosis of small-cell-type lung cancer labels.

TI Three-dimensional porous ultrathin carbon networks reinforced
   PBAs-derived electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), identified with a face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cell with transition-metal ions bridged by cyano ligands, can be used as precursors in nanomaterials for catalysis applications, but the performance is usually limited by the original large size of PBAs. We provide here a controllable thermal decomposition route for PBAs to obtain highly dispersed small-sized nanoparticles with high catalytic activity. CoFe PBA nanocubes as catalyst precursors are grown within three-dimensional porous ultrathin N-doped carbon networks (3DNC), which is constructed using mixed soluble salts as templates. The use of 3DNC as supporting matrix can not only increase the electrical conductivity and transport properties of reaction-relevant species within the catalyst material, but also supply huge specific surface and restrict the size of loaded nanoparticles. Followed by calcination in the reductive atmosphere, the PBA nanocubes are decomposed to form numerous small-sized CoFe/CoFeOx nanoparticles that are uniformly dispersed. It is interesting to find that this thermal decomposition process is assisted by 3DNC matrix because of its excellent thermal conductive property. Benefiting from the synergetic bimetal alloy/oxide composition, advantageous structural feature and favorable interfacial integration of the hybrid material, the CoFe/CoFeOx@3DNC exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The decomposition of PBAs precursor to small-sized nanoparticles and the use of 3DNC as supporting matrix and thermal conductive agent are appealing. The integration of these two components provides an interesting hybrid catalyst system with controllable composition, delicate morphology and favorable interfacial property.

TI Transparent aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion battery
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Aqueous sodium-ion battery is a sustainable, non-toxic, non-flammable, and low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries, while transparency is a growing requisite of modern and integrated devices that batteries have yet to fulfill. In this work we present the preparation of a transparent and rechargeable aqueous Na-ion battery, assembled with different thin films of carbon/cobalt-based nanomaterials as electrodes. Cobalt-filled carbon nanotubes and cobalt/cobalt oxide encapsulated carbon nanoparticles are simultaneously synthesized in one single experimental procedure and deposited as thin and transparent films through the liquid/liquid interfacial route. The former is used for the electrosynthesis of a Prussian blue analogue, yielding carbon nanotubes/cobalt hexacyanoferrate thin film nanocomposite used as cathodes, while the cobalt/cobalt oxide/carbon nanoparticles thin film is used as the anode. The transparent device is prepared using a diluted aqueous solution of NaCl as the electrolyte, reaching capacities of 22 mAh & BULL;g(-1) at 2 A & BULL;g(-1) that remains stable after 2000 charge/discharge cycles, and energy density of 19.2 Wh & BULL;kg(-1) at 1.4 kW & BULL;kg(-1).

TI Magnetic-supported catalyst derived from red mud-based Fe-Co PBA for
   efficient degradation of organic pollutants by activating
   peroxymonosulfate under visible light
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB To alleviate the environmental pressure caused by the continuous accumulation of solid waste red mud (RM) and organic pollutants, we developed a magnetic-supported catalyst derived from RM-based Fe-Co Prussian blue analogues (RM-Co PBA-D) using RM as the iron source and carrier. Then, the catalyst was used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) under visible light for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) and rhodamine B (RhB). Due to the superior dispersion, strong visible light response, and high photo-generated carrier separation efficiency of the RM-Co PBA-D, the RM-Co PBA-D/PMS/Vis system could completely degrade both TC (10 mg/L) and RhB (20 mg/L) in 30 min, with mineralization efficiencies as high as 70.12 % and 60.59 %, respectively. Several reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as SO4 center dot-, center dot OH-, center dot O-2(-), O-1(2), and h(+) were involved in the degradation process, with SO4 center dot- and O-1(2) playing a dominant role. More importantly, except for the production of ROS, the regeneration of active sites (Co2+/Fe2+) mediated by photo-generated carriers was also a critical factor in enhancing the removal of organic pollutants. In addition, the constructed system demonstrated significant potential for practical applications, which was attributed to the stable structure and catalytic performance of the catalyst as well as the strong ability of the system to resist interference by impurity anions and detoxify organic pollutants.

TI High-entropy cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries: Correlating
   synthesis, crystal structure and electrochemical properties
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Since the emergence of research on cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, numerous chemical compositions were investigated as potential promising candidates. Layered transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds, and Prussian blue analogues are the main reported categories. Their practical use in large-scale applications depends on maintaining good electrochemical properties and high structural/thermal stabilities. High entropy materials have shown great interest by the research community as they were reported to exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance and preserved structural integrity by suppressing or delaying the phase transitions during insertion/de-insertion of Na+ ions. This review presents the crucial role of cathode materials in defining the performance of the overall battery and the encountered challenges and limitations. The concept of high entropy (HE) as well as its advantageous effect on the physico-chemical properties was emphasized. Furthermore, special attention was given to the high entropy cathode materials by correlating their experimental preparation, structural properties, and electrochemical performance in sodium-ion batteries. Finally, the prospects and challenges for developing future HE cathodes were discussed.

TI NiFeCo alloy nanoparticles composited with phosphorus-doped
   vacancies-abundant carbon substrates as electrocatalyst for oxygen
   evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Transition metal alloy nanoparticles are cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions. Preparing alloy catalysts with flexible controllability, high activity, and long-term stability is a challenge. By adjusting the proportion of metal atoms and engineering vacancies through their composite with a carbon substrate, we can enhance electron transfer and modulate the adsorption capacity of reaction intermediates. Herein, we synthesized a hybrid catalyst using Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) as the precursor, doped with Fe and Ni atoms, and subjected them to a defective engineering and phosphatization process. As an efficient alkaline OER electrocatalyst, the formation of the alloy increases the number of active sites, while the defect-rich phosphorus-doped carbon substrate improves internal electron transfer and mass transfer channels. The synthesized NiFeCoPC-1.5 electrocatalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity with an overpotential of 211 mV at 10 mA cm -2 and a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec -1 , and demonstrates good stability up to 1000 CV cycles. This work will expand the application of alloy nanoparticles in oxygen evolution electrodes.

TI Self-template synthesis of hollow Fe-doped CoP prisms with enhanced
   oxygen evolution reaction activity
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB The development of efficient, durable and low cost electrocatalysts is crucial but extremely challenging for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we develop a self-template strategy to synthesize hollow Fe-doped CoP prisms (Fe-CoP) via ion exchange of cobalt acetate hydroxide with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) and phosphorization-induced transformation of CoFe-PBA (Co/Fe-containing prussian blue analogue) prisms in N-2 atmosphere. The obtained Fe-CoP not only inherits the hollow prism-like morphology of CoFe-PBA, but also forms rich mesoporous channel. The Fe-CoP prisms exhibit extraordinary OER performances in 1.0 M KOH, with a low overpotential of 236 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 32.9 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the presented electrocatalyst shows good long-term operating durability and activity. The XPS and TEM analysis confirm that Fe-CoP has undergone surface reconstruction in the process of electrocatalytic OER, and the in situ formed oxides and oxyhydroxides are the real active species to boost OER. This work provides a promising pathway to the design and synthesis of efficient and robust electrocatalysts with hierarchical hollow structure for boosting OER.

TI Effect of conductive additives on the transport properties of porous
   flow-through electrodes with insulative particles and their optimization
   for Faradaic deionization
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Deionization devices that use intercalation reactions to reversibly store and release cations from solution show promise for energy-efficient desalination of alternative water resources. Intercalation materials often display low electronic conductivity that results in increased energy consumption during desalination. Accordingly, we performed experiments to quantify the impact of the size and mass fraction of conductive additives and insulative active particles on the effective electronic conductivity, ionic conductivity, and hydraulic permeability of porous electrodes. We find that Ketjen black conductive additives with nodules <50 nm in diameter produce superior electronic conductivity at lower mass fractions than the larger carbon blacks commonly used in capacitive deionization. Hydraulic permeability and effective ionic conductivity depend weakly on carbon black content and size, though smaller active particles decrease hydraulic permeability. Based on these results we analyzed the energy consumption and salt removal rate of different electrode formulations by constructing an electrochemical Ashby plot predicting the variation of desalination performance with electrode transport properties. Optimized electrodes containing insulative Prussian blue analogue (PBA) particles were then fabricated and used in an experimental cation intercalation desalination (CID) cell with symmetric electrodes. For 100 mM NaCl influent energy consumption varied from 7 to 33 kJ/mol when current density increased from 1 to 8 mA/cm(2), approaching ten-fold increased salt removal rate at similar energy consumption levels to past CID demonstrations. Complementary numerical and analytical modeling indicates that further improvements in energy consumption and salt removal rate are attainable by enhancing transport in solution and within PBA agglomerates.

TI Temperature-controlled fabrication of Co-Fe-based nanoframes for
   efficient oxygen evolution
SO SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS
AB Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts to enhance the slow kinetic process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Framelike hollow nanostructures (nanoframes, NFs) provide the open structure with more accessible active sites and sufficient channels into the interior volume. Here, we report the fabrication of bimetallic Co-Fe phosphide NFs (Co-Fe-P NFs) via an intriguing temperature-controlled strategy for the preparation of precursors followed by phosphidation. The precursors, Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues (Co-Fe PBAs) are prepared by a precipitation method with Co2+ and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), which experience a structural conversion from nanocubes to NFs by increasing the aging temperature from 5 to 35 degrees C. The experimental results indicate that this conversion is attributable to the preferentially epitaxial growth on the edges and corners of nanocubes, triggered by intramolecular electron transfer at an elevated aging temperature. The as-prepared Co-Fe-P NFs catalyst shows remarkable catalytic activity toward OER with a low overpotential of 276 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the reference samples (Co-Fe-P nanocubes) and most of the recently reported TMPs-based electrocatalysts. The synthetic strategy can be extended to fabricate Co-Fe dichalcogenide NFs, thereby holding a great promise for the broad applications in energy storage and conversion systems.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB In this work for the first time pore-space-partition (PSP)-CoFePBA hollow framework is elaborately designed and successfully obtained via self-template internal dissolution strategy. As is demonstrated by our previous report, Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with hollow morphology is very beneficial to improve sensing performance. As expected, the PSP-CoFePBA hollow framework in this work exhibits far superior glucose sensing performance compared with classic CoFePBA nanoparticles and nanoboxes as well as most of reported PBA-based glucose sensors. Herein, very high sensitivity of 1184.18 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and 267.63 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) in the concentration range of 5-325 mu M and 325-1025 mu M, respectively, as well as low detection limit of 0.4 mu M (S/N=3) and high stability can be observed. In a word, this work proposes and develops a simple and general synthetic strategy for constructing PBA-based hollow material, that will be very helpful in this field.

TI Hollow yolk-shell nanoboxes assembled by Fe-doped
   Mn3O4 nanosheets for high-efficiency
   electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in Zn-Air battery
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The rational design of cost-effective and highly-performance transition metal-based electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essentially desirable to realize the commercial applications of metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Herein, Fe-doped Mn3O4 hollow yolk-shell nanoboxes (Fe-Mn3O4 HYSNBs) assembled from ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of 1.5 nm are fabricated via utilizing KMn[Fe(CN)(6)] prussian blue analogs as the sacrificed precursor. Choreographed construction of such hybrid hierarchical architecture and composite is responsible to generate substantially active sites and abundant channels for mass diffusion and ion transport. The resultant Fe-Mn3O4 HYSNBs exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability, as well as good tolerance to methanol towards ORR in alkaline solution. Theoretical calculation demonstrates that the highly dispersed Fe active sites implanted within ultrathin Mn3O4 nanosheets can effectively regulate electronic structure and ORR intermediates adsorption energy. Moreover, Fe-Mn3O4 HYSNBs display high power density and specific capacity as an air-cathode in Zn-Air batteries, demonstrating outstanding practicability.

TI Crystallite Size Control of Prussian White Analogues for Nonaqueous
   Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Nonaqueous potassium-ion batteries have emerged as possible low-cost alternatives to Li-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage, owing to their ability to use graphitic carbon as the negative electrode. Positive electrode materials remain a challenge. Here, we report control of the crystal dimensions of the Prussian white hexacyanoferrate (HCF), K1.7Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.9), using solution chemistry to obtain either nano, submicron, or micron crystallites. We observe a very strong effect of crystallite size on electrochemical behavior. The optimal cathode material comprised of 20 nm crystallites delivers a close-to-theoretical reversible capacity of 140 mAh g(-1) with two well-defined plateaus at 4.0 and 3.2 V vs K/K+ upon discharge. Slightly inferior electrochemical behavior is observed for crystallites up to similar to 160-200 nm in diameter, but unlike the analogous Na HCFs, micron-sized crystals show very limited capacity. For the nanosized crystallites, however, the energy density of similar to 500 Wh kg(-1) is comparable to that of the best Na HCF cathode materials. At a relatively high current density of 100 mA g(-1) half-cells cycled with ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) demonstrate an initial discharge capacity of 120 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles and 65% after 300 cycles.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have come into the limelight in the field of microwave absorption since they can be developed into porous carbon-based MOF derivatives with a variety of features, such as controlled defects, tunable structures, and variable compositions. In this paper, Cu3[Co(CN)6]2 Prussian blue analogue (CuCo-PBA) precursors with a regular cubic morphology were synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method and converted into CuCo nanocube/N-doped carbon nanotube (CuCo/NCNT) derivatives by annealing them in argon. It was found that when the annealing temperature was 850 degrees C, the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of CuCo/NCNT could reach -54.13 dB with an effective absorption bandwidth of 4.01 GHz. The excellent microwave absorption properties were attributed to the mutual synergy of conduction loss, interfacial polarization, magnetic resonance loss, and eddy current loss. Therefore, this work provides an effective preparation method for the design of lightweight carbon-based microwave-absorbing materials with heterogeneous interfaces using Prussian blue.

TI Mitigating Intraphase Catalytic-Domain Transfer via CO2 Laser
   for Enhanced Nitrate-to-Ammonia Electroconversion and Zn-Nitrate Battery
   Behavior
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Developing sustainable energy solutions is critical for addressing the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental impact. In this study, a zinc-nitrate (Zn-NO3-) battery system was designed for the simultaneous production of ammonia (NH3) via the electrocatalytic NO3- reduction reaction (NO3RR) and electricity generation. Continuous wave CO2 laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe2O4@nitrogen-doped carbon (CoFe2O4@NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe-PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO3RR in 1.0 M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH4+ production rate of 10.9 mg h(-1) cm(-2) at -0.47 V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode with exceptional stability. In situ and ex situ methods revealed that the CoFe2O4@NC surface transformed into high-valent Fe/CoOOH active species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO3RR (*NO2 and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations validated the possible NO3RR pathway on CoFe2O4@NC starting with NO3- conversion to *NO2 intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH2 species, leading to NH3 formation via final protonation. The Zn-NO3- battery utilizing the CoFe2O4@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open-circuit voltage of 1.38 V versus Zn/Zn2+ and producing NH3. This study highlights the innovative use of CO2 laser irradiation to transform Prussian blue analogs into cost-effective catalysts with hierarchical structures for NO3RR-to-NH3 conversion, positioning the Zn-NO3- battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.

Herein, we demonstrated the harvesting of solid-state ammonium bicarbonate from fetid air in an actual piggery.

TI Self-sacrificial growth of hierarchical P(Ni, Co, Fe) for enhanced
   asymmetric supercapacitors and oxygen evolution reactions
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Highly efficient and environmentally friendly multifunctional electrode materials for application in super -capacitors to electrocatalysis are important for advances in the future of electrical energy storage and green hydrogen production. This work reports a simple growth strategy to obtain hierarchical P(Ni, Co, Fe) modified electrodes by phosphating a core/shell composite of nickel-cobalt (NiCo) Prussian blue analogues fabricated through an in situ self-sacrificial growth process. Due to the unique microstructure, abundant surface-active sites, and enhanced interfacial conductivity, the hybrid electrode exhibits specific capacitance as high as 1125.8 F g-1 (3.7 F cm-2) at 2 mA cm-2, excellent rate capability and improved cycling stability (97.1% retention capacitance after 5000 cycles at 50 mA cm-2 and 89.9% after continuous 5000 cycles at 100 mA cm-2). Furthermore, the hybrid structure shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 252 mV at 100 mA cm-2 and 283 mV at 300 mA cm-2, with a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec- 1, and overall water splitting abilities with a cell voltage of 1.55 V at 100 mA cm-2. This work provides insights into the design of next -generation high-performance multifunctional electrode materials by controlling the surface/interface of multi -component structures for enhancing their properties.

TI Inter-particle structural fluctuation of Prussian blue analogue as
   investigated by X-ray microbeam diffraction
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The X-ray microbeam diffraction from each particle leads to a deeper structural characterization, i.e. inter-particle structural fluctuation, of powdery compound. Here, we performed X-ray microbeam diffractions of NaxCo1-zNiz[Fe(CN)(6)](y) at BL40XU beamline of SPring-8. In the whole region of z, the inter-particle structural fluctuation is negligible in the as-grown powder. We found that the average ((d012) over bar) of the spacing (d(012)) of the (012) plane decreases with X-ray irradiation time (t). The standard deviation (sigma) of d(012) steeply increases with t from 0.006 angstrom at t = 1 s to 0.031 angstrom at t = 60 s, indicating that inter-particle structural fluctuation is induced by the X-ray irradiation.

TI Improving the cycle life of a high-rate, high-potential aqueous dual ion
   battery using hyper-dendritic zinc and copper hexacyanoferrate
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA)-Zn aqueous batteries are attractive because of the high potential of PBA against Zn (similar to 1.7 V), relative safety of the system, and high rate capability. But, despite the long cycle life of PBA half-cells, full PBA-Zn battery systems studied thus far have typically reported only up to 100 cycles and suffer significant capacity fade beyond that. In this work we demonstrate that the loss in capacity retention and cycle life is a combined effect of Zn2+ ion poisoning at the PBA cathode, as well as dendrite formation in the zinc anode. We address both these issues via the use of a dual ion (Na+ as the primary charge carrier) electrolyte and hyper-dendritic Zinc (HD Zn) as the anode. The copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHcf) vs. HD Zn system with Na+ ion electrolyte demonstrated herein exhibits 90% (83%) capacity retention after 300(500) cycles at a 5C rate and a 3% reduction in usable capacity from 1C to 5C. Detailed characterization is done using in situ synchrotron energy-dispersive XRD (EDXRD), conventional XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and electrochemical techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Slower Removing Ligands of Metal Organic Frameworks Enables Higher
   Electrocatalytic Performance of Derived Nanomaterials
SO SMALL
AB The widely used route of high-temperature pyrolysis for transformation of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) to functional nanomaterials leads to the fast removal of CN- ligands, and thus the formation of large metal aggregates and the loss of porous structures inside PBAs. Here, a controllable pyrolysis route at low temperature is reported for retaining the confined effect of CN- ligands to metal cations during the whole pyrolysis process, thereby preparing high-surface-area cubes comprising disordered bimetallic oxides (i.e., Co3O4 and Fe2O3) nanoparticles. The disordered structure of Co3O4 enables the exposure of abundant oxygen vacancies. Notably, for the first time, it is found that the in situ generated CoOOH during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can inherit the oxygen vacancies of pristine Co3O4 (i.e., before OER), and such CoOOH with abundant oxygen vacancies adsorbs two -OH in the following Co3+ to Co4+ for markedly promoting OER. However, during the similar step, the ordered Co3O4 with less oxygen vacancies only involves one -OH, resulting in the additional overpotentials for adsorbing -OH. Consequently, with high surface area and disordered Co3O4, the as-synthesized electrocatalysts have a low potential of 237 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing most of reported electrocatalysts.

TI Pitaya-like microspheres derived from Prussian blue analogues as
   ultralong-life anodes for lithium storage
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB To alleviate the capacity degradation of conventional anode materials caused by serious volume expansion and particle aggregation for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), considerable attention has been devoted to the rational design and synthesis of novel anode architectures. Herein, we report an effective fabrication strategy to implant well-distributed carbide nanoparticles into spherical porous carbon frameworks to form pitaya-like microspheres. Benefiting from their unique components and architecture features, the as-synthesized pitaya-like microspheres can effectively buffer the volume change and prevent aggregation of Co3ZnC nanoparticles during the charge/discharge processes of LIBs. The porous carbon framework provides an unhindered pathway for electron transport and Li+ diffusion and restricts the thin solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer to the outer surface of carbon outer-shells. In LIBs, the anodes deliver a high capacity of 608 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after 300 charge/discharge cycles and ultrahigh cyclic stability and rate performance with a capacity of 423 mA h g(-1) even after 1150 consecutive cycles at 1000 mA g(-1).

TI Heterostructured hollow cobalt-nickel core-shell hexacyanoferrate
   nanocubes for enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of urea molecules in
   alkaline electrolyte
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The hollow cobalt-nickel core-shell hexacyanoferrate (CoNiHCF) nanocube is prepared by forming a thin nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) shell on a hollow cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) nanocube as a synergistic catalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The CoNiHCF reduces the peak-to-peak separation of the cyclic voltammo-grams for Ni2+/Ni3+ couple, which favors the reversible regeneration of active Ni3+ species. NiHCF, a kind of Prussian blue analogue, has greater UOR kinetics than nickel foam and CoHCF, due to its open framework structure with redox-active nickel and iron species. The hollow core-shell architecture affords numerous path-ways for fast electron and electrolyte transport, enhancing the adsorption and oxidation of urea molecules on the catalytic Ni3+ sites. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals superior UOR kinetics of CoNiHCF compared to the NiHCF catalyst, reflected by its low electrical resistance, charge-transfer resistance, and direct UOR resistance. The CoHCF core in the CoNiHCF provides a conductive host to immobilize the nickel-rich catalyst shell to promote the formation of high-valence species Ni3+ to boost the electrocatalytic activity of the CoNiHCF. The CoNiHCF catalyst exhibits a high oxidation current (175 mA cm-2 at 1.570 V), small onset potential (1.335 V), and remarkable durability, rendering it a highly promising catalyst material for UOR.

TI Tuning the Electrochemical Stability of Zinc Hexacyanoferrate through
   Manganese Substitution for Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Aqueous rechargeable Zn-ion batteries (ARZIBs) attract intensive attention as an alternative battery technology for large-scale electrochemical energy storage applications because of their low cost, intrinsic safety, and environmental friendliness. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), as a promising candidate for cathode materials, possess severe capacity decay issues in ARZIBs. In this article, a small amount of Mn ions is successfully introduced into the N-bonded metal sites of zinc hexacyanoferrate to adjust its electrochemical stability. The N-bonded metal composition of PBAs directly affects the Zn-ion intercalation chemistry. The coexistence of Mn and Zn in the PBAs shows a synergistic effect on the electrochemical stability, resulting in superior cycle performance than that of the PBAs with a single N-bonded metal (Mn or Zn). Optimized capacity retention, 94% of the initial discharge capacity after 500 galvanostatic cycles, is achieved with the Mn content of 7%. The Mn substitution suppresses the cubic-rhombohedral phase transition and makes the solid-solution mechanism dominant during the Zn-ion insertion. It furthermore suppresses the solubility in the aqueous solution and thus reduces the active material loss of electrodes in the aqueous electrolyte. This research indicates the important role of the N-bonded metals of PBAs in improving their electrochemical stability in ARZIBs.

TI Fe-doped CoS2 nanoparticles supported CoS2
   microspheres@N-doped carbon electrocatalyst for enhanced oxygen
   evolution reaction
SO APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING
AB Non-noble electrocatalysts (such as transition metal sulfides) have been attractive to substitute noble-metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to advance the practical application of clean energy. Herein, a Fe-doped CoS2 nanoparticles supported CoS2 microspheres@N-doped carbon (Fe-CoS2/CoS2@NC) is prepared as an efficient OER electrocatalyst. The Fe-CoS2/CoS2@NC composite is derived by sulfurizing the metanilic-intercalated Co(OH)(2) microspheres decorated with binary active CoFe-Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) nanoparticles. The obtained composite combines the advantageous characteristics for enhancing electrocatalytic performances: binary active Fe-CoS2 derived from CoFe-PBA, active CoS2, N-doped carbon scaffold to improve electronic conductivity, the appropriate specific surface area and meso/macroporous size distribution to afford rich active sites. The Fe-CoS2/CoS2@NC requires an overpotential of 300 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming those of NC/CoS2, NC/Fe-CoS2 and CoS2. Furthermore, the enhancement is experimentally supported by the low charge-transfer resistance and the large electrochemical active surface area during the OER. The synthesis approach could be extended to provide a tunable hydroxide/PBAs precursor-based approach for designing and preparing hierarchical structures as electrocatalysts.

TI CuFe-P from a Prussian blue analogue as an electrocatalyst for efficient
   full water splitting
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB The development of electrocatalysts with abundant reserves and high catalytic activity is a prerequisite for large-scale hydrogen production from electrolyzed water. This article is based on a feasible design idea, using a metal-organic framework (MOF) derivative supported on a foamed nickel (NF) transition metal phosphating catalyst for efficient hydrolysis. In 1.0 M aqueous KOH solution, the CuFe-P/NF electrode only needs an overpotential of 231 mV in the OER to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and an overpotential of 153 mV in the HER to reach 10 mA cm(-2). It is encouraging that the alkaline electrolytic cell assembled with CuFe-P/NF electrodes can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at an extremely low voltage of 1.577 V, which is currently one of the lower values achieved by non-precious metal electrocatalysts. This work undoubtedly provides a new strategy that can be implemented on a large scale for the synthesis of highly efficient, dual-functional MOF derivative electrocatalysts.

Analogues of Prussian blue can provide millions of cyclic voltammetric cycles in aqueous electrolyte. Potassium intercalation chemistry has recently been demonstrated compatible with both graphite and nongraphitic carbons. In addition to potassium ion batteries, potassium -O-2 (or air) and potassium sulfur batteries are emerging. Additionally, aqueous potassium ion batteries also exhibit high reversibility and long cycling life. Because of potentially low cost, availability of basic materials, and intriguing electrochemical behaviors, this new class of secondary batteries is attracting much attention.

TI Ethanolamine-modified gel electrolyte of zinc ion battery
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The rapid growth of wearable electronic devices has spurred the development of flexible energy storage systems. However, the limitations of conventional rigid commercial batteries have hindered the advancement of wearable technology. Consequently, the development of stable, safe, highly flexible, and cost-effective flexible batteries has become a key focus in current battery research. Herein, we introduce a novel multifunctional flexible Prussian Blue-zinc battery utilizing a PVA-ZnCl2 polymer gel electrolyte (EGPE) enhanced with ethanolamine (ETA), aimed at addressing the deficiencies of traditional electrolytes in terms of safety and mechanical performance. The Zn||Zn symmetric cell using EGPE electrolyte demonstrated an impressive long-term cycling stability of over 3000 hours at a current density of 0.15 mA cm(-2). In contrast, the symmetrical cell using 0.8 M ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte maintained its stability for only 400 hours. In addition, the prepared flexible zinc Prussian blue device maintained more than 65 % of its initial capacity of the device and its coulombic efficiency was close to 100 % after 400 cycles at an extreme current density of 10 A g(-1). Furthermore, flexible device using the EGPE was able to maintain a stable power supply under various bending, torsion, folding and shearing conditions. Such innovative gel electrolyte demonstrated considerable prospects for utilisation in portably equipped devices and energy storage systems.

TI FeNi-Layered Double-Hydroxide Nanoflakes with Potential for
   Intrinsically High Water-Oxidation Catalytic Activity
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Oxygen-evolution-reaction (OER) and oxygen-reduction-reaction (ORR) catalysts on a gas-diffusion carbon paper (CP) electrode have been explored as a current hot topic. Low-cost and earth-abundant FeNi (oxy)-hydroxides have the potential to be the best-performing OER catalyst families. Here, we report on Fe-rich FeNi-layered double-hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes (Fe/Ni = 1:1.5 mol/mol) with a sheet dimension of 10-20 nm and bearing an increased number of OER-active sites. An aqueous dispersion solution of FeNi Prussian blue analog nanoparticles (PBA NPs) is drop-cast on CP, and their metal compositions and microgram-scale mass-loading amounts are systematically controlled. The PBA NPs are transformed into LDH nanoflakes in an alkaline aqueous solution. To the best of our knowledge, compared to the previously reported catalysts, the LDH nanoflakes intrinsically show potential comparable to that of catalysts with the highest activity, based on the lowest Tafel slope (15.1 mV dec(-1)) and the highest values of turnover frequency (1.58 s(-1)) and mass activity (10 600 A g(-1)) at a low overpotential of 300 mV. Drop-coated Mn2+ ions significantly enhance the intrinsic ORR activity of CP. The independently optimized OER and ORR catalysts are united on the same sheet of CP as a bifunctional pair.

TI Assembling Smallest Prussian Blue Analogs Using Chiral Hydrogen
   Bond-Donating Unit toward Complete Phase Transition
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Exploring methods for assembling functional materials at the molecular level may yield functional expressions derived from the assembly method. This study developed novel switchable molecular assemblies characterized by abrupt, complete phase transitions promoted via hydrogen bonding with a chiral carboxylic acid. These assemblies were prepared by aggregating discrete molecules that are unresponsive to external stimuli. Furthermore, enantiopure hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) molecules provide switchable compounds with cooperative and abrupt phase transitions, whereas the racemic mixture of the HBD provides a hydrogen-bonded one-dimensional compound with a broad and incomplete phase transition when structural disordering is observed. This study presents a novel strategy for observing metal-to-metal electron-transfer-coupled spin transitions via hydrogen-bond formation.

TI Hollow core-shell nanostructured
   MnO2/Fe2O3 embedded within amorphous
   carbon nanocomposite as sensitive bioplatform for detecting protein
   tyrosine kinase-7
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB We designed and synthesized a novel bimetallic MnFe oxides embedded within amorphous carbon layer (represented by MnO2/Fe2O3@aC) and exploited it as the scaffold to construct a label-free electrochemical aptasensor for selectively detecting the trace cancer marker, i.e., protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7). The used MnO2/Fe2O3@aC composite was derived from the composite of the bimetallic MnFe Prussian blue analog (MnFe PBA) and polypyrrole (PPy) by calcination at 400 degrees C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations revealed that coexisting metal ions (Mn2+, Mn3+, and Fe2+) and metallic Fe (Fe-0) were contained in the pristine hollow MnFe PBA and MnFePBA@PPy nanoboxes. After calcination, metallic ions (Mn2+ and Fe2+) were oxidized to their corresponding metal oxides (MnO2 and Fe2O3). Meanwhile, the covered PPy layer over MnFe PBA was transferred into carbon nitride. The coexistence of MnO2, Fe2O3, amorphous carbon, and various functional N-related groups endows the as-prepared MnO2/Fe2O3@aC composite strong binding interaction with aptamer strands and good electrochemical activity. Most importantly, the synergistic effect between bimetallic oxide particles and amorphous carbon can improve the electrochemical activity of the substrate and also can enhance the G-quadruplex stability in aqueous solution formed between the aptamer strands and PTK7 via biorecognition force. This force further improves the sensing performance toward PTK7. The fabricated MnO2/Fe2O3@aC-based aptasensor exhibited a low detection limit of 44 fg mL(-1) within a broad PTK7 concentration from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) and 20 cell.mL(-1) toward human esophageal cancer EC9706 cells ranged from 1x10(2) to 1x10(6) cell.mL(-1), along with high selectivity, good stability and reproducibility, and acceptability in the human serum. The elaborated aptasensor provides a novel strategy for building PBA-based and PBA derivative-based sensors for the sensitive detection of various cancer markers.

TI Tuning the morphology and pyrolysis process of rare-earth Gd-doped
   prussian blue derivatives for electromagnetic wave absorption and
   anti-corrosion performance
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Prussian blue analogs (PBA) derivatives have been researched extensively as electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbers. However, the metallic components are typically transition-metal elements, which results in limited potential for optimization of their EMW absorbing performance. In this work, GdCo-PBA derivates with different carbon nanotubes (CNTs) morphologies and phase compositions were synthesized via tuning the pyrolysis rate and the dielectric loss capability can be tuned. As a result, the R-GdN/Co@CNTs achieved the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of -36.74 dB@1.7 mm and the maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 5.61 GHz @ 2.0 mm due to the combined effect of the interconnected CNTs conduction network and the GdN phase in optimizing the impedance matching and enhancing the dielectric loss. Meanwhile, the radar cross section (RCS) simulation and electrochemical corrosion tests confirmed that GdCo-PBA derivatives can significantly reduce RCS values of 28.6 dBm(2) @ 15 degrees and possessed satisfied anti-corrosion properties with a corrosion current density of 2.06 x 10(-5) A/cm(2) and polarization resistance of 2.57 x 10(4) Omega, which displayed significant potential for practical applications in extreme marine environments. This work presents a strategy for synthesizing lanthanide PBA derivates with the EMW absorbing and anti-corrosion properties.

TI In situ anchoring of bimetal (Cu, Fe) sulfides featured by sulfur
   vacancy and phosphorus doping within porous carbon nanocubes derived
   from Prussian blue analogs to activate peroxymonosulfate for the
   efficient degradation of organic pollutants
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this work, Prussian blue analogues (CuFe-PBA) derived copper-iron sulfides/N-doped porous carbon composite (CuFe-NC-SP-x) was prepared as an effective peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator to degrade sulfadiazine (SDZ). A strategy that kills two birds with one stone was proposed to construct CuFe-NC-SP-x, i.e., S-etched CuFe-PBA (CuFe-PBA-S) was annealed with NaH2PO2 in N-2 atmosphere to simultaneously introduce sulfur vacancy (Sv) and phosphorus doping. 40 mu M SDZ was completely removed by CuFe-NC-SP-2/PMS in 20 min (0.2 g/L catalyst and 0.5 mM PMS). The k(obs) value obtained by CuFe-NC-SP-2 (0.48 min(-1)) was nearly 33 and 17 times higher than that of CuFe-PBA (0.014 min(-1)) and CuFe-PBA-S (0.028 min(-1)), respectively. Quenching tests, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis indicated that PMS activation in the system involved radical pathway (26.1 % OH and 22.7 % SO4-) and non-radical pathway (17.8 % O-1(2) and 33.4 % electron transfer process). OH, SO4- and O-1(2) were mainly produced by S enhanced metal sites for PMS activation. The synergistic effect of Sv and P doping enabled the powerful electron transfer mechanism. Electrochemical tests and DFT calculations demonstrated that Sv existing in CuFe-NC-SP-x improved the electron donor ability and increased the adsorption energy toward PMS, and phosphorus doping accelerated the electron transport from SDZ to PMS. This work not only provides a novel strategy to synthesize a high effective PMS activator by introducing Sv and phosphorous doing in one step, but also manages to comprehensively understand the electron transfer activation mechanisms of PMS facilitated by Sv and phosphorous doping.

TI Fluorine-Doped Tin Oxide/Alumina as Long-Term Robust Conducting Support
   for Earth-Abundant Water Oxidation Electrocatalysts
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB In this work we apply a novel and simple methodology to develop a composite that consists of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) covered by a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) film. The composite presents suitable morphological and electrical properties to be used as support for water electrooxidation catalysts based on non-noble metals. AAO substrates were decorated with FTO via spray pyrolysis, followed by deposition of catalyst nanoparticles consisting of a cobalt-analogue of Prussian Blue that promotes the oxygen evolution reaction. The electrodes were characterized by X-ray Diffraction, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy and resistivity measurements. A promising electrocatalytic activity of the optimized AAO/FTO/PB electrode was observed at neutral pH and ambient conditions. The obtained results open a feasible strategy in the search for competitive water oxidation electrodes based on the combination of earth-abundant metal catalysts on FTO-covered anodized alumina supports.

TI A Rechargeable Battery with an Iron Metal Anode
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB To date, tremendous efforts of the battery community are devoted to batteries that employ Li+, Na+, and K+ as charge carriers and nonaqueous electrolytes. However, aqueous batteries hold great promise for stationary energy storage due to their inherent low cost and high safety. Among metal batteries that use aqueous electrolytes, zinc metal batteries are the focus of attention. In this study, iron as an anode candidate in aqueous batteries is investigated because iron is undoubtedly the most earth-abundant and cost-effective metal anode. Reversible iron plating/stripping in a FeSO4 electrolyte is demonstrated on the anode side and reversible topotactic (de)insertion of Fe2+ in a Prussian blue analogue cathode is showcased. Furthermore, it is revealed that LiFePO4 can pair up with the iron metal anode in a hybrid cell, delivering stable performance as well.

SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB In the course of the last years hexacyanoferrates have been widely studied; even though, the adsorption properties of Zn (II) hexacyanoferrate(II) (labelled here Zn-HII) have not been thoroughly considered. In addition, soft porous crystals, i.e., adsorbents that display structural flexibility have been, as well, extensively studied, however this property has not been reported for Zn (II) hexacyanoferrate(II). In this regard, the key questions addressed here were the synthesis and structural characterization of Zn-HII together with the investigation of their low (up to 1 bar) and high pressure (up to 30 bar) adsorption properties, to found if these materials show structural flexibility. Then, to attain the anticipated goals, structural characterizations were made with: X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectrometry (DRIFTS) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), simultaneously, with the investigation of the adsorption of carbon dioxide. As a result of the research process we concluded that the Zn-HII displayed Fm3m space group framework. Besides, the carbon dioxide adsorption investigation demonstrated the presence of the framework expansion effect together with an extremely high adsorption heat, properties that could be useful for the use of Zn(II) hexacyanoferrate(II) as an excellent adsorbent.

TI Anodically Grown Binder-Free Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Film: Toward
   Efficient Water Reduction and Hexacyanoferrate Film Based Full Device
   for Overall Water Splitting
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB One of the challenges in obtaining hydrogen economically by electrochemical water splitting is to identify and substitute cost-effective earth-abundant materials for the traditionally used precious-metal-based water-splitting electrocatalysts. Herein, we report the electrochemical formation of a thin film of nickel-based Prussian blue analogue hexacyanoferrate (Ni-HCF) through the anodization of a nickel substrate in ferricyanide electrolyte. As compared to the traditionally used Nafion-binder-based bulk film, the anodically obtained binder-free Ni-HCF film demonstrates superior performance in the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is highly competitive with that shown by a Pt-plate electrode. The HER onset and the benchmark cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) were achieved at small overpotentials of 15 mV and 0.2 V (not iR-corrected), respectively, in 1 M KOH electrolyte, together with the long-term electrochemical durability of the film. Further, a metal-HCF-electrode-based full water-splitting device consisting of the binder-free Ni-HCF film on a Ni plate and a one-dimensional Co-HCF film on carbon paper as the electrodes for the HER and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, was designed and was found to demonstrate very promising performance for overall water splitting.

TI Fabrication of CoFe/N-doped mesoporous carbon hybrids from Prussian blue
   analogous as high performance cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB CoFe/N-doped mesoporous carbon hybrids are synthesized by a simple pyrolysis of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) and melamine, in which the structure is rationally designed by controlling the weight ratio of PBA/melamine and annealing temperature. By applying the composite as the cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, it demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performances including a high reversible capacity (1315 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), excellent rate capability (724 and 496 mAh g(-1) at 2 and 5 C rates, respectively) and superior cycling stability (528 and 367 mAh g(-1) at 2 and 5C after 500 cycles, respectively). The synergetic effect of the mesoporous carbon matrix, uniform sized CoFe nanoparticles and N heteroatoms simultaneously contributes to the confinement of sulfur species. The presence of abundant mesopores and micropores can physically confine sulfur species. The formed CoFe-N-x moieties can not only improve the electronic conductivity of the as-prepared composites, but also offer highly effective active sites for chemical absorption and catalytic transformation of polysulfides to suppress any shuttle effect. In addition, the mesoporous structure can effectively alleviate the volume changes resulted from charge-discharge process. The strategy developed in this work proposes an alternative way to obtain N-doped mesoporous carbon matrix modified with CoFe nanoparticles for high performance cathode materials of lithium-sulfur batteries.

TI An experimental and theoretical approach to electrochemical sensing of
   hydrazine at silver and copper hexacyanoferrates electrodes
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB This work evaluates the electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine (HDZ) by silver (AgHCF) and copper (CuHCF) hexacyanoferrates-modified glassy carbon electrodes kinetically and analytically through experimental electrochemistry and theoretical approaches. The materials were prepared by a two-step cyclic voltammetry (CV) routes and had their structural and morphological attributes attested by microscopic and spectroscopic characterization techniques. The AgHCF and CuHCF-modified electrodes showed quasi-reversible characteristics driven by K+ diffusion and adsorption processes, respectively. The kinetic properties of the materials towards HDZ electrooxidation were evaluated through CV and chronoamperometry techniques. The analyte exhibited irreversible electron transfer controlled by semi-infinite diffusion process for both Prussian blue analogs. The CuHCFmodified electrode showed superior diffusion coefficient (D = 2.17x10-5 cm2 s- 1) and catalytic rate constant (kcat = 1.75x103 L mol-1 s- 1) comparing to the silver analog (D = 2.31x10-6 cm2 s- 1 and kcat = 8.06x102 L mol-1 s- 1). The copper-based material also exhibited higher sensitivity (S) obtained through CV (S = 42 nA L mu mol L-1) and batch injection analysis-coupled amperometry (BIA/amp) (S = 66.8 nA L mu mol L-1) measurements, in comparison to AgHCF-modified electrode (S = 25 nA L mu mol L-1 - CV; S = 22.3 nA L mu mol L-1 - BIA/ amp). Theoretical approaches showed that CuHCF material required lower energy (Delta Egap = 0.0397 eV) to promote an electron to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital due to its cubic structural arrangement, justifying the better electrocatalytic results comparing to the hexagonal structure of the AgHCF material (Delta Egap = 0.0840 eV).

AB In the process of finding new forms of energy extraction or recovery, the use of various natural systems as potential clean and renewable energy sources has been examined. Blue energy is an interesting energy alternative based on chemical energy that is spontaneously released when mixing water solutions with different salt concentrations. This occurs naturally in the discharge of rivers into ocean basins on such a scale that it justifies efforts for detailed research. This article collects the most relevant information from the latest publications on the topic, focusing on the use of the mixing entropy battery (MEB) as an electrochemical ion pumping device and the different technological means that have been developed for the conditions of this process. In addition, it describes various practices and advances achieved by various researchers in the optimization of this device, in relation to the most important redox reactions and the cathode and anodic materials used for the recovery of blue energy or salinity gradient energy.

TI Truncated cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanocubes threaded by carbon nanotubes
   as a high-capacity and high-rate cathode material for dual-ion
   rechargable aqueous batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have been regarded as one of promising electrode candidates in aqueous batteries, due to its open framework, robust skeleton, and simple preparation protocol. However, intrinsic structure vacancies and poor electron conductivity lower their electrochemical performances, particularly in terms of reversible capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. Here, truncated cobalt hexacyano-ferrate nanocubes threaded by carbon nanotubes are synthesized with the assistances of citrate and glycerol. The low content of structure vacancies in cobalt hexacyanoferrate, and the intimate contact between it and carbon nanotubes, well address the above issues, resulting in excellent performances in rechargeable aqueous batteries. The reversible capacity reaches 107.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), 87.3% of which is kept at 5 A g(-1). After paired with Zn foil as a dual-ion full cell, it delivers a high energy of 107.1 Wh kg(cathode)(-1) at 7.87 kW kg(cathode)(-1), exhibiting the high energy and high power simultaneously. All these results indicate the promising potential of this composite in rechargeable aqueous batteries.

TI Titanium hexacyanoferrate/carbon nanotube composites as the cathode
   material for aqueous sodium/zinc ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), featuring its low cost and environmental protection, are regarded as the promising alternative for traditional energy storage devices acting on clean power generation and electrical vehicles. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have received a lot of attention for a potential cathode candidate in AZIBs due to its competence in accommodating various ions with good electrochemical stability. However, conventional PBAs have some inherent problems in Zn ions de-intercalation involving of high discharge potential separation, low structural stability, and high raw material cost. Herein, titanium hexacyanoferrate/carbon nanotube composite (TiHCF-CNT) is synthesized and applied to the cathode materials for aqueous sodium/zinc ion batteries at the first time. The resultant material exhibits not only a high capacity for 134.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 A g(-1), but also excellent cycling stability of 93.7 % capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.3 A g(-1). Na+ in the electrolyte can decrease the resistance of electrolyte and co-insert in the material structure with Zn2+, thus elevate the electrochemical performances remarkably. Moreover, the defects in the structure are identified as Ti vacancies, and these defects can be occupied by Zn2+ reversibly at the charging-discharging process, which lead to a high reversible capacity and cycle stability accordingly.

TI Multi-core-shell nanoboxes comprising polydopamine-derived C coated
   NiCo@C and FeCo@C nanohybrid for enhanced electrochemical quantification
   of nitrofurantoin
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The development of a high-performance electrochemical sensing platform for monitoring nitrofurantoin (NFT) levels in various real samples plays an important role in the research community worldwide. To accomplish this objective, the crucial challenge is to construct sensing interfaces with outstanding electrocatalytic capabilities. In the present work, a highly efficient metal@carbon electrocatalyst with porous and multi-core-shell nanobox structure comprising polydopamine (PDA)-derived C coated NiCo@C and FeCo@C nanohybrid (named as NiCo@C/FeCo@C@C) was fabricated by simply pyrolyzing NiCo@FeCo Prussian blue analogues (PBA)@PDA. The carbonization of PDA into carbon shells protected the framework from collapsing during high-temperature pyrolysis process, thus enlarging the specific surface areas and porosity. The NiCo@C/FeCo@C@C composite attained an enhanced electrochemical capability, such as an outstanding electronic conductivity from the double carbon shell with porous structure, a large number of active sites and a high electrocatalytic activity from the metallic alloy nanoparticles, which exhibited a highly sensitive response to NFT. Under optimized experimental conditions, the established NiCo@C/FeCo@C@C electrochemical sensor displayed a wide linear range of 0.05-100 mu M for NFT determination, coupled with a low detection limit of 14 nM. The practical feasibility of this sensor was also confirmed by the analysis of NFT in tablet and lake water samples with outstanding recovery rates. Moreover, the sustainability of the sensor was demonstrated through its prominent performance in high reproducibility, selectivity and long-term stability. This study thus introduces an innovative approach for the advance of highly efficient electrocatalysts in the area of electrochemical sensing.

TI Alleviated mechanical structure decay and accelerated transport kinetics
   via KNCHCF@NiHCF core - shell structure for aqueous potassium-ion
   batteries
SO MATERIALS TODAY NANO
AB The sluggish ion transport and mechanical decay caused by K + intercalation can hinder the K + storage ability of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), potential cathode materials for potassium -ion batteries (PIBs). The construction of composite materials using adjustable chemical components of PB is an effective method to improve cycling stability. In this study, a core-shell structure of KNiCoFe(CN) 6 @NiFe(CN) 6 (KNCHCF@NiHCF) was prepared to utilize the inertness of Ni 2+ and the stability of Fe-C - -- N-Ni bonds and enhance the performance of PBAs. Different concentrations of NiHCF coating (Ni -0, Ni -2, Ni -5, and Ni -60) were introduced into the outer layer of KNCHCF using a simple solution precipitation method. The aforementioned core-shell structure and the corresponding built-in electric field enhanced the structural stability and K + /e - transport kinetics of the fabricated materials. And Ni -5 exhibited the best electrochemical performance with excellent durable cycling stability and rate performance. Furthermore, the reversible single -phase insertion and extraction reaction of K + storage mechanism within the Ni -5 cathode was revealed using ex -/in -situ characterization techniques. This strategy may facilitate the development of other cathode materials for rechargeable metal ion batteries.

TI Acetamide-based deep eutectic solvents as efficient electrolytes for K -
   MnHCFe//Zn dual-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB In this study, a cost-effective, eco-friendly deep eutectic solvent (DES), comprising acetamide, sodium perchlorate, and zinc chloride serves as an innovative electrolyte for dual ion batteries. Notably, the DES exhibits a broad electrochemical stability window, self-extinguishing behavior, and great resilience in low temperatures. The interplay between the electrolyte components is being thoroughly scrutinized, with a particular focus on the benefits of adding a co-solvent to the DES. This addition prevents unwanted reactions and zinc dendrite growth through the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, ultimately leading to enhanced coulombic efficiency and cyclic stability. The electrochemical performance of zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) using a Prussian blue analog (K -MnHCFe) as cathode is being examined in the dual-ion DES electrolyte. The device displays a discharge capacity of 76.4 mAh g-1 at 0.3 A g-1 and a maximum energy density of 111.7 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 437.5 W kg-1 . Furthermore, it retains 65 % of its initial specific capacity even after 3000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 . It is noteworthy that the ZIB device with dual-ion DES operates normally in temperatures as low as-20 degrees C, outperforming traditional cells with aqueous electrolytes.

TI Electro-activated peroxymonosulfate based on hollow cubic skeleton
   nanoflower cathode catalyst MoSe2/cubic nanocage (CNC) for
   enhanced degradation of norfloxacin: Performance, mechanism, degradation
   pathways and toxicity
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Recently, antibiotic wastewater pollution has become increasingly serious. In this study, a novel hollow cubic framework self-supported nanoflower-like cathode catalyst (MoSe2/CNC) based on Co Fe prussian blue analogues (CoFePBA)-derived cubic nanocage (CNC) loaded with MoSe2 was successfully prepared and utilized in an electro-activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system for norfloxacin (NOR) degradation. Benefit from the combined structures of MoSe2, MoC, and Co/Fe-N-C, the electrocatalytic activity and specific surface area were greatly improved. The effects of catalyst dosage and ratio, current, PMS concentration, electrolyte type, pH, as well as initial concentration were comprehensively investigated. Under the optimal conditions, NOR and TOC removal reached 92.70% and 82.17%, respectively, which was superior to the previous studies. Additionally, center dot O-2(-) was proved to be the primary reactive species for NOR degradation.center dot Based on density functional theory (DFT) and intermediates analysis, NOR underwent substitution and ring-opening reactions in the piperazine ring, substitution of fluoride ions, and cleavage of the carboxyl group and tetrahydropyridine ring, ultimately converting into water, carbon dioxide, and inorganic ions. Moreover, toxicity assessment and seed germination experiments demonstrated that the toxicity of NOR and intermediates were strongly decreased by electro-activated PMS system based on MoSe2/CNC cathode. Overall, this study not only contributes to the evolution of efficient and sustainable wastewater purification technology, but also provides valuable insights into the degradation of antibiotic wastewater.

TI Selective Control of Composition in Prussian White for Enhanced Material
   Properties
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Sodium-ion batteries based on Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are ideal for large-scale energy storage applications due to the ability to meet the huge volumes and low costs required. For Na2-xFe[Fe(CN)(6)](1-y)center dot zH(2)O, realizing its commercial potential means fine control of the concentration of sodium, Fe(CN)(6) vacancies, and water content. To date, there is a huge variation in the literature of composition leading to variable electrochemical performance. In this work, we break down the synthesis of PBAs into three steps for controlling the sodium, vacancy, and water content via an inexpensive, scalable synthesis method. We produce rhombohedral Prussian white Na1.88(5)Fe[Fe-(CN)(6)]center dot 0.18(9)H2O with an initial capacity of 158 mAh/g retaining 90% capacity after 50 cycles. Subsequent characterization revealed that the increased polarization on the 3 V plateau is coincident with a phase transition and reduced utilization of the high-spin Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple. This reveals a clear target for subsequent improvements of the material to boost long-term cycling stability. These results will be of great interest for the myriad of applications of PBAs, such as catalysis, magnetism, electrochromics, and gas sorption.

SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB The magnetic properties of a series of core-shell particles based on the Prussian blue analogues K0.1Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](0.7).3.5H(2)O and K0.1Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.7).4.4H(2)O (CuFe-PBA@NiFe-PBA) are investigated as a function of electrochemical titration and lithium ion insertion. The particles, with average size 305 +/- 50 nm, are reduced using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique to prepare 10 samples of Lix(CuFe-PBA@NiFe-PBA) with 0 <= x <= 1.0. Magnetization as a function of temperature for each member of the series reveals the ferromagnetic ordering of the individual components, NiFe-PBA (T-c similar to 24 K) and CuFe-PBA (T-c similar to 18 K). The magnetic ordering of each component is suppressed upon reduction and Li+ incorporation, but in a stepwise fashion with the CuFe-PBA core reduced before the NiFe-PBA shell. The separate reductions of the core and shell are also seen in magnetization vs field measurements at low temperature. By introducing a lattice-gas model, the enthalpy changes (Delta H-i) associated with each redox couple after Li-ion insertion were calculated and applied to the mean field approximation to reproduce the magnetic transition temperatures. The results are significant as the CuFe-PBA@NiFe-PBA particles had previously been shown to exhibit superior performance over the individual components as cathode materials for lithium ion batteries, although the stepwise reduction had not previously been discerned. Furthermore, the report is the first showing the systematic control of magnetism in core-shell coordination polymer heterostructures by electrochemical guest ion insertion.

TI Understanding dehydration of Prussian white: from material to aqueous
   processed composite electrodes for sodium-ion battery application
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted much attention as potential cathode materials for sodium-ion battery (SIBs) applications. The presence of water in these compounds plays a significant role on the electrochemical behaviour, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the dehydration process. Herein, we investigate the properties and the dehydration effects on the structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of a Prussian White (PW) cathode material (Na2-xFe[Fe(CN)(6)](1-y)& BULL;zH(2)O). The use of such material as well as the water-based electrode processing method employed matches the requirements for low toxicity, cost, and resource abundance in large-scale applications. By combining temperature dependent in situ X-ray diffraction analysis, ex situ structural and morphological investigation and electrochemical characterization, it is found that water removal is a kinetically driven process that is strongly affected by the experimental conditions (e.g., temperature, heating rate, atmosphere) and the environment of the PW system (material vs. composite electrode). This study addresses the challenges driven by the presence of surface adsorbed and interstitial water in PW systems and offers insights into the processability of water-based PW electrodes and their electrochemical response under different dehydration conditions. Optimal conditions to transition from a sodium-rich hydrated monoclinic phase toward a sodium-rich dehydrated rhombohedral phase are identified and are found to be different when comparing data from PW material in its powder form and PW material within a composite electrode for SIB application.

TI Hydrous Nickel-Iron Turnbull's Blue as a High-Rate and Low-Temperature
   Proton Electrode
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Proton batteries are emerging as a promising solution for energy storage; however, their development has been hindered by the lack of suitable cathode materials. Herein, a hydrous Turnbull's blue analogue (TBA) of Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](2/3)center dot 4H(2)O has been investigated as a viable proton cathode. Particularly, it shows an extremely high rate performance up to 6000 C (390 A g(-1)) at room temperature and delivers good capacity values at a low temperature of -40 degrees C in an aqueous electrolyte. The excellent rate capability is also amenable to high mass loadings of 10 mg cm(-2). Such fast and low-temperature rate behavior likely stems from the fast proton conduction that is afforded by the Grotthuss mechanism inside the TBA structure. Furthermore, advanced characterization, including in operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption near-edge structure ()CANES) were employed to understand the changes of crystal structures and the oxidation-states of metal elements of the electrodes.

TI Hierarchical CoCoPBA@PCN-221 nanostructure for the highly sensitive
   detection of deoxynivalenol in foodstuffs
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB An electrochemical impedimetric immunosensor was constructed based on a hierarchical nanostructured CoCo Prussian blue analogue entrapped by a Zr-based porphyrin MOF (denoted by CoCoPBA@PCN-221) for the sensitive detection of deoxynivalenol (DON). Given that CoCoPBA@PCN-221 demonstrated a hierarchical nanostructure, large specific surface area, and the synergistic effect between mixed metal valence states (Co2+/ Co3+) and Zr clusters, it thus displayed a high binding interaction with the DON-targeted antibody. Compared with CoCoPBA and PCN-221, CoCoPBA@PCN-221 showed a superior stabilization ability toward the antibody -antigen complex in aqueous solution. Under optimum conditions, the CoCoPBA@PCN-221-based impedimetric immunosensor exhibited a good linear range from 1 fg mL-1 to 1 ng mL-1, and an ultralow detection limit of 0.14 fg mL-1, accompanied by high selectivity, reproducibility, stability, and applicability in foodstuffs. This method allows the integration of MOFs with cascading properties for applications in the biosensing and food safety fields.

TI Increasing Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Efficiency through
   Cobalt-Induced Intrastructural Enhancement and Electronic Structure
   Modulation
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB Electrolytic water splitting using surplus electricity represents one of the most cost-effective and promising strategies for hydrogen production. The high overpotential of the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) caused by the multi-electron transfer process with a high chemical energy barrier, however, limits its competitiveness. Here, a highly active and stable OER electrocatalyst was designed through a cobalt-induced intrastructural enhancement strategy combined with suitable electronic structure modulation. A carved carbon nanobox was embedded with tri-metal phosphide from a uniform Ni-Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocube by sequential NH3 center dot H2O etching and thermal phosphorization. The sample exhibited an OER activity in an alkaline medium, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 182 mV and displayed a small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1), superior to the most recently reported OER electrocatalysts. Moreover, it showed impressive electrocatalytic durability, increasing by approximately 2.7 % of operating voltage after 24 h of continuous testing. The excellent OER activity and stability are ascribed to a favorable transfer of mass and charge provided by the porous carbon shell, synergistic catalysis between the three-component metal phosphides originating from appropriate electronic structure modulation, more exposed catalytic sites on the hollow structure, and chainmail catalysis resulting from the carbon protective layer. It is foreseen that this successfully demonstrated design concept can be easily extended to other heterogeneous catalyst designs.

TI Establishing aqueous zinc-ion batteries for sustainable energy storage
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Aqueous rechargeable Zn-ion batteries (ARZIBs) have been becoming a promising candidates for advanced en-ergy storage owing to their high safety and low cost of the electrodes. However, the poor cyclic stability and rate performance of electrodes severely hinder their practical applications. Here, an ARZIBs configuration consisting of Cr3+-substituted Cu-Rich Prussian blue analogues (CuCrFe(CN)6) cathode, electrodeposited zinc nanosheets on copperclad carbon framework (ZnNS@CuCF) anode, and Zn(OTf)2-based electrolyte with ethylene sulfate (DTD) that are proposed. Combining the in situ characterization, ex situ synchrotron radiation and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Cr3+-substitution and K+ extraction can effectively lower the band gap of the electrodes and Zn ion diffusion activation energy. Thus, the assembled ARZIBs system delivers the excellent electrochemical performance such as large specific capacity of 183.9 mAh g-1, high energy density of 239.2 Wh kg- 1 and impressive cyclic stability with the capacity retention of 92.4% after 13,000 discharging/charging cycles.

TI Simultaneous tuning of the cation content and pore structure of
   cobalt-iron bimetal phosphide to enhance the electrochemical oxygen
   evolution
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Effective electrocatalysts can be prepared by modifying the contents and optimizing the morphology of materials. In this study, we developed a series of porous cobalt-iron bimetal phosphide nanoarchitectures (p-CoFeP-x) with tunable contents and pore structures to act as catalysts for electrochemical oxygen evolution. A reasonable intrinsic activity and high density of the active site could be realized by adjusting the amount of zinc in a Prussian blue analogue precursor. The optimized catalyst (pCoFeP-0.35) exhibited a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 48.8 mV.dec(-1). Moreover, the p-CoFeP-0.35+Pt/C electrode pair used in a water splitting cell exhibited a performance comparable to that of the commercial RuO2+Pt/C cell, along with a higher stability. Furthermore, the p-oFeP-0.35+Pt/C mixture applied in a rechargeable zinc-air battery as oxygen electrocatalyst outperformed the RuO2+Pt/C mixture. The presented findings can provide guidance for optimizing porous bimetal phosphide catalysts for energy related applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Construction of CoO/Co 9 S 8 /NC composites with low-frequency and
   broadband electromagnetic wave absorption
SO CARBON
AB Low -frequency electromagnetic wave absorption (EMWA) materials were crucial for addressing electromagnetic pollution and radar stealth. However, achieving low -frequency and broadband absorption still faces challenges. In this work, a succession of CoO/Co 9 S 8 /N-doped carbon (NC) composites were fabricated via a partial sulfidation strategy of Co -Prussian blue analogue (Co-PBA). The as -prepared CoO/Co 9 S 8 /NC composites featured a porous architecture. The electromagnetic parameters were effectively modulated via varying the sulfidation time. When the sulfidation time was 9 h, the minimum reflection loss (RL min ) value was -50.40 dB at 2.93 mm and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth value was 5.76 GHz (12.24 - 18.00 GHz) at 1.80 mm. Notably, when the sulfidation time was 12 h, the composites exhibited enhanced EMWA capability in the low -frequency Sband (3.52 GHz) with an RL min value of -28.91 dB. The superior EMWA performance of composites were primarily attributed to appropriate dielectric constants and optimized impedance matching due to magnetic loss. Moreover, the radar cross section simulation consequences further verified that dissipation capability of electromagnetic wave of the CoO/Co 9 S 8 /NC composites in the actual far field. This work afforded novel perspectives into the rational develop of PBA-derived carbon -based EMWA materials with the low -frequency and broadband absorption.

TI Heterostructured and multi-dimensional Ni-Co tellurides/NiTe with
   enhanced reaction kinetics for hybrid supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB A Prussian blue analogue is grown in situ on nickel foam (NF) by a co-precipitation strategy, which is further converted into Ni-Co tellurides ((Ni-Co)Te)/NiTe through a hydrothermal method. The obtained (Ni-Co)Te/NiTe shows a heterogeneous and multi-dimensional structure, which displays a high areal specific capacitance of 2390.7 mF cm -2 at 1 mA cm -2 and a high capacitance retention of 80.3 % after 5000 cycles. Further, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is assembled by using the (Ni-Co)Te/NiTe grown on NF (NF@(Ni-Co)Te/NiTe) as the cathode and activated carbon (AC) supported on NF (NF@AC) as the anode, respectively. The HSC exhibits a maximum energy density of 95.6 Wh kg -1 at the power density of 444.5 W kg -1 , which is higher than most of the HSCs previously reported. The synergistic effect of the heterojunction in the (Ni-Co)Te/NiTe and its multidimensional structure plays a crucial role in the enhanced reaction kinetics of the HSC.

TI Coupling dual metal active sites and low-solvation architecture toward
   high-performance aqueous ammonium-ion batteries
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Aqueous rechargeable ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs) possess the characteristics of safety, low cost, environmental friendliness, and fast diffusion kinetics. However, their energy density is often limited due to the low specific capacity of cathode materials and narrow electrochemical stability windows of electrolytes. Herein, high-performance aqueous AIBs were designed by coupling Fe-substituted manganese-based Prussian blue analog (FeMnHCF) cathodes and highly concentrated NH4CF3SO3 electrolytes. In FeMnHCF, Mn3+/Mn2+-N redox reaction at high potential was introduced, and two metal active redox species of Mn and Fe were achieved. To match such FeMnHCF cathodes, highly concentrated NH4CF3SO3 electrolyte was further developed, where NH4+ ion displays low-solvation structure because of the increased coordination number of CF3SO3- anions. Furthermore, the water molecules are confined by NH4+ and CF3SO3- ions in their solvation sheath, leading to weak interaction between water molecules and thus effectively extending the voltage window of electrolyte. Consequently, the FeMnHCF electrodes present high reversibility during the charge/discharge process. Moreover, owing to a small amount of free water in concentrated electrolyte, the dissolution of FeMnHCF is also inhibited. As a result, the assembled aqueous AIBs exhibit enhanced energy density, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling behavior. This work provides a creative route to construct high-performance aqueous AIBs.

This type of cell has a benefit due to its intrinsic zinc-dendrite-free nature. The cell is designed to be positive-limited with a capacity of 62.3 mAh g(-1).

TI Hierarchically Designed Cathodes Composed of Vanadium
   Hexacyanoferrate@Copper Hexacyanoferrate with Enhanced Cycling Stability
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been highlighted as electrode materials for aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs because of their favorable crystal structure and electrochemical activity. However, dissolution of the transition-metal ions during cycling degrades the materials and hinders the development of longlife-span batteries. To overcome this limitation, a strategy to revive the capacity degradation of PBA-based cathodes was developed herein based on designing all-PBA-based core@shell materials, while specific reduction upon introducing the shell layers was minimized. The core@shell materials were constructed using a V/Fe PBA (high capacity) core and a Cu/Fe PBA (high cycling stability) shell via a two-step co-precipitation method. The electrochemical performances including specific capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability as a function of the Cu/Fe PBA shell thickness were explored. At the optimal Cu/Fe PBA thickness, improved capacity retention after 200 cycles of >90% (72% for the core only) was attained with negligible capacity reductions from 94 (core only) to 90 (core shell) mA h g(-1), arising from the high electrochemical activity and stability of the Cu/Fe PBA shell and stabilized interfaces due to the crystallographic coherence between the core and shell materials. In addition, the power performance of the core@shell materials was significantly improved, e.g., C-38.4C /C-0.6C for a core@shell of 80% and core only of 62%, arising from the unique chemical coordination and facile ion diffusion kinetics of the Cu/Fe PBA shell. The newly developed V/Fe@Cu/Fe PBA-based cathodes offer an effective strategy for fabricating sustainable and low-cost ARBs.

TI Influence of Structural Imperfection on Electrochemical Behavior of
   Prussian Blue Cathode Materials for Sodium Ion Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Prussian blue compounds (PBs) have been intensely studied as promising cathode materials for sodium ion batteries due to their rigid open framework which benefits Na+ insertion/extraction. However, the existence of Fe(CN)(6) vacancies occupied by coordinating H2O in the framework has great influence on the electrochemical performance. In this work, we prepared PB compounds using simple solution precipitation method at 0 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 80 degrees C, respectively. The obtained Na1.73Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.98)square(0.02) (PB0), Na1.27Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.94)square(0.06) (PB40) and Na1.12Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.92)square(0.08) (PB80) samples were investigated to clarify the effects of Fe(CN) 6 vacancies and the coordinating H2O molecules on the electrochemical behavior. CV tests indicated that coordinating H2O could be gradually extracted and attend side reaction at near 4.0V, which led to impedance growth and caused capacity decrease during cycling. Dehydrated PB samples showed increased reversible capacities. However, the cycling stability of the PBs mainly depended on the perfection of the lattice structure. Low defect structure Na1.73Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.98)square(0.02) exhibited superior cycling stability with initial reversible capacity of 105 mAh g(-1) (100 mA g(-1)) and intact cubic phase lattice structure during long term cycling. Dehydrated Na1.73Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.98)square(0.02) showed further improved reversible capacities of 123 mAh g(-1) (100 mA g(-1)) with 73% capacity retention after 200 cycles.

TI 3D Carbon Nanotube Network Bridged Hetero-Structured Ni-Fe-S Nanocubes
   toward High-Performance Lithium, Sodium, and Potassium Storage
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and potassium-ion batteries have captured tremendous attention in power supplies for various electric vehicles and portable electronic devices. However, their practical applications are severely limited by factors such as poor rate capability, fast capacity decay, sluggish charge storage dynamics, and low reversibility. Herein, hetero-structured bimetallic sulfide (NiS/FeS) encapsulated in N-doped porous carbon cubes interconnected with CNTs (Ni-Fe-S-CNT) are prepared through a convenient co-precipitation and post-heat treatment sulfurization technique of the corresponding Prussian-blue analogue nanocage precursor. This special 3D hierarchical structure can offer a stable interconnect and conductive network and shorten the diffusion path of ions, thereby greatly enhancing the mobility efficiency of alkali (Li, Na, K) ions in electrode materials. The Ni-Fe-S-CNT nanocomposite maintains a charge capacity of 1535 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) for lithium ion batteries, 431 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) for sodium ion batteries, and 181 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) for potassium-ion batteries, respectively. The high performance is mainly attributed to the 3D hierarchically high-conductivity network architecture, in which the hetero-structured FeS/NiS nanocubes provide fast Li+/Na+/K+ insertion/extraction and reduced ion diffusion paths, and the distinctive 3D networks maintain the electrical contact and guarantee the structural integrity.

TI ZIF-L Derived Bimetallic N-Doped Porous Carbon-Prussian Blue Composite
   as Efficient Catechol Electrochemical Sensor
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The development of effective and accurate catechol (CC) electrochemical sensors is critical for environment and life health perspectives. A facile pyrolysis of 2D bimetallic (Zn/Co) zeolitic imidazolate framework (Zn/Co-ZIF-L) was employed to prepare Zn and Co nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped porous carbon (Zn/Co @NPC). Prussian blue (PB) was synthesized in situ via the co-precipitation of ferricyanide ([Fe(CN)(6)](3-)) and iron (II) ion originated from the reduction of Fe3+ by Zn/Co@NPC and then served as the main active substance of CC detection. The morphology and composition of the final composite Zn/Co@NPC-PB were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The Zn/Co@NPC-PB modified glass carbon electrode (GCE) exhibits two concentration linear ranges of 4.13 mu M - 1.08 mM (R-2 = 0.999) and 1.08 mM-11.82 mM (R-2 = 0.999) for CC electrochemical detection with a limit of detection 1.05 mu M (S/N = 3). At the same time, the Zn/Co@NPC-PB/GCE shows great selectivity to electrochemical oxidation behavior of CC in presence of 20 folds dihydroxybenzene interferents such as hydroquinone and resorcinol. Furthermore, it showed a long-term stability and near 100% recovery for the detection of a real sample in Yellow River water. (C) 2021 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Herein, through a coordination strategy of facet-selective etching and in-situ growth, the CoCo Prussian blue analogue (PBA)/CoSn(OH)(6)/Pt heterojunction was designed and prepared with multiple interfaces and dual interconnection networks, which is suitable for photocatalytic conversion of simulated flue gas. This unique structure is conducive to multi-channel electron transmission and multiple light scattering, promoting the sep-aration and migration of photogenerated carriers. This photocatalyst can synergistically regulate charge potential and kinetics, and enhance CO2 activation. Therefore, the CO generation rate (11.7 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1)) and selectivity (91.8 %) of the CoCo PBA/CoSn(OH)(6)/Pt heterojunction were significantly improved without using additional photosensitizer or sacrificial agent. The mechanism and reaction pathway of photocatalytic CO2 reduction were further studied by in-situ technology and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. This study offers knowl-edge about the preparation of high-efficiency photocatalysts for flue gas conversion and structure-modulated photocatalytic reaction.

TI Development of Novel Electrochemical Biosensors Based on Horseradish
   Peroxidase for the Detection of Caffeic Acid
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this study, biosensors based on two types of screen-printed carbon and Prussian blue-carbon electrodes, respectively, modified with peroxidase extracted from horseradish root for the sensitive and selective detection of caffeic acid were developed. The presence of the enzyme in the aqueous extract and the activity of peroxidase was demonstrated by spectrometric methods. The electrochemical technique used for the determination of caffeic acid with the biosensors was the cyclic voltammetry. Calibration of the biosensors towards caffeic acid was carried out in solutions of different concentrations, ranging from 5 to 74 mu M. Suitable sensitivities and detection limits for practical applications were obtained, with the more sensitive (0.72 mu A center dot mu M-1) one being the biosensor containing Prussian blue as a mediator of the exchange between electrons with a detection limit of 0.9 mu M. Caffeic acid was successfully determined and quantified in three food supplements using the Prussian blue-peroxidase-based biosensor. The method used to validate the results obtained with the biosensor in the food supplements was a comparison with the amounts indicated by the producers, with no differences between the results at a 99% confidence level.

TI Cu-Ni-CoSex quaternary porous nanocubes as enhanced Pt-free
   electrocatalysts for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells and
   hydrogen evolution in alkaline medium
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A series of porous cubic nanomaterials have been prepared through a facile one-step selenylation process, in which Cu-Ni-Co, Ni-Co and Cu-Co Prussian-blue analog nanocubes transformed to Cu-Ni-CoSex, Ni-CoSex and Cu-CoSex nanocubes, respectively. Among these samples, the quaternary porous nanocubes (Cu-Ni-CoSex) proved to be the excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts in dye-sensitized solar cells and hydrogen evolution reactions. Under the standard irradiation, Cu-Ni-CoSex nanocubes exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 9.74% in solar cells, which was much superior than that of N (8.19%). Cu-Ni-CoSex nanocubes also delivered superb hydrogen evolution performance in terms of a low overpotential (50.2 mV) under the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope (49.6 mV dec(-1)) in alkaline medium. The outstanding characteristics of CuNi-CoSex nanocubes were benefited from their uniform sizes, porous morphologies, high surface area, low charge transfer resistances and good synergies among multiple elements.

TI Vanadium hexacyanoferrate with two redox active sites as cathode
   material for aqueous Zn-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Aqueous rechargeable Zn-ion batteries (ARZIBs) are attractive due to their low cost, high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the development of ARZIBs still faces many challenges. One of the biggest challenges is to find suitable cathode materials for reversible Zn2+ ions insertion/extraction. In this work, we synthesize a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with a new chemical composition, vanadium hexacyanoferrate (VHCF), via a simple co-precipitation method and study its performance as a cathode material for an aqueous rechargeable Zn-ion battery. The VHCF with two electrochemical redox active sites, V and Fe, delivers a three-electron redox reaction with a capacity of 187 mA h g(-1) at current density of 0.5 A g(-1). Even at a current rate of 5 A g(-1), VHCF can still deliver a large capacity of 122 mA h g(-1). The Zn//VHCF battery also exhibits a long cycle life of 1000 cycles with excellent capacity retention of 87.8% and a high Coulombic efficiency close to 100%. During the first charging process, the cubic structure of VHCF changes to a rhombohedral phase, a structure where the Zn2+ ions can be reversibly inserted into and extracted from in subsequent cycles. The promising performances make VHCF an attractive candidate as cathode material for ARZIBs system.

TI Investigation of Binary Metal (Ni, Co) Selenite as Li-Ion Battery Anode
   Materials and Their Conversion Reaction Mechanism with Li Ions
SO SMALL
AB Highly efficient anode materials with novel compositions for Li-ion batteries are actively being researched. Multicomponent metal selenite is a promising candidate, capable of improving their electrochemical performance through the formation of metal oxide and selenide heterostructure nanocrystals during the first cycle. Here, the binary nickel-cobalt selenite derived from Ni-Co Prussian blue analogs (PBA) is chosen as the first target material: the Ni-Co PBA are selenized and partially oxidized in sequence, yielding (NiCo)SeO3 phase with a small amount of metal selenate. The conversion mechanism of (NiCo)SeO3 for Li-ion storage is studied by cyclic voltammetry, in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and ex situ transmission electron microscopy. The reversible reaction mechanism of (NiCo)SeO3 with the Li ions is described by the reaction: NiO + CoO + xSeO(2) + (1 - x)Se + (4x + 6)Li+ + (4x + 6)e(-) <-> Ni + Co + (2x + 2)Li2O + Li2Se. To enhance electrochemical properties, polydopamine-derived carbon is uniformly coated on (NiCo)SeO3, resulting in excellent cycling and rate performances for Li-ion storage. The discharge capacity of C-coated (NiCo)SeO3 is 680 mAh g(-1) for the 1500th cycle when cycled at a current density of 5 A g(-1).

TI yMoO4<SUP>2</SUP>- modified amorphous Co(PO3)2
   cubes as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline overall
   water splitting
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The exploration of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions is an important way to promote the development of electrolytic water technology. Herein, the reduced graphene oxide-supported MoO42- modified amorphous cobalt metaphosphate cubes (a-Co(PO3)2/MoO4/rGO) as bifunctional OER/HER catalyst is prepared by anion exchange and phosphating, using the Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a precursor. The resulting composite exhibits the low overpotentials (g) that of 290 and 50 mV for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH solution at 10 mA cm-2, respectively. The electrochemical test and density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that the MoO42--modified optimizes the adsorption/desorption energy of H* of Co(PO3)2, thus enhance the HER activity. Benefiting from efficient HER and OER performances, an efficient and stable alkaline water electrolysis operation using a-Co(PO3)2/MoO4/rGO used as bifunctional catalyst can be carried out, which can deliver a current density (j) of 20 mA cm-2 at 1.65 V cell voltage and work continuously for 24 h.

TI Degradation of norfloxacin by CoFe alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in
   nitrogen doped graphitic carbon (CoFe@N-GC) activated peroxymonosulfate
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Developing carbon-based hybrid catalysts with high reactivity, good stability, and low cost is critical for environmental remediation via heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (A0Ps). In this work, CoFe alloy particles encapsulated in nitrogen doped graphitic carbon (donated as CoFe@N-GC), in situ converted from cobalt modified Prussian blue (PB) precursor through a two-step carbonization route, is rationally designed and synthesized as an advanced catalyst for the degradation of antibiotics norfloxacin (NOF) by coupling with peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The resultant hybrid catalyst can not only offer a conducive network that promotes the electron transfer but also protect the metal species from being leached out. By serving as a catalyst/activator, it shows an outperforming performance in catalytic degradation of organic pollutants than other catalysts (i.e. CuO, CoF2O(4), and biochar). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results clearly reveal that the sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot- ) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) are the dominant reactive oxidative species (ROS). After four successive cycles, CoFe@N-GC sill performs excellent catalytic activity, leading to a NOF degradation of 94.4% within 20 mM ([NOF] = 15 mu M, [PMS] = 0.2 mM, [Catalyst] = 0.05 g L-1, pH = 6.0). This study highlights the in situ synthesis of CoFe@N-GC with outstanding activities for catalytic degradation of organic pollutants.

SO ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS
AB The lack of acid stability in the stomach and of temporal stability when moving through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has made the development of oral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents based on the platform of Gd3+-complexes problematic.On the other hand, the negative contrast enhancement produced by the T-2-weighted magnetic metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) often renders the image readout difficult. Biocompatible NPs of the manganese Prussian blue analog K2Mn3[Fe-II(CN)(6)](2) exhibit extremely high stability under the acidic conditions of the gastric juice. Additionally, the high r(1) relaxivity, low toxicity, and high temporal stability of such NPs offer great potential for the development of a true T-1-weighted oral contrast agent for MRI of the entire GI tract.

TI Template confined construction of Fe-NiCoP/NiCoP/NF heterostructures for
   highly efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Rational design of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with advance nano structures and composition superiority is an urgent need to promote electrocatalytic property. In this research, we fabricate Fe-NiCoP/NiCoP/NF electrocatalyst for OER via the interfacial scaffolding strategy with Prussian-blue-analogue (PBA) followed by low temperature phosphating. The cube-on-sheet multimetallic-TMPs-based nano architecture of Fe-NiCoP/NiCoP/NF exhibits outstanding OER performance, which only requires the overpotential of 201 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and possesses good durability up to 50 h in 1.0 M KOH solution. The superior OER property of Fe-NiCoP/NiCoP/NF is mainly characteristic to the rich composition that optimizes the electronic structure and the cube-on-sheet multimetallic-TMPs-based nanoarchitecture which can facilitate more effective active sites exposure and ultimately promote charge transfer at the same time. This research provides a new strategy for the construction of advanced nanoarrays structure and the improvement of the electrocatalytic performance of polymetallic phosphides, which offers its promising applications especially in energy storage and conversion technology.

TI Resorcinol Formaldehyde Resin-Coated Prussian Blue Core Shell Spheres
   and Their Derived Unique Yolk Shell FeS2@C Spheres for
   Lithium-Ion Batteries
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The practical applications of transition metal sulfides as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is greatly hindered by the fast capacity fading owing to the large volume expansion. To address this issue, construction of transition metal sulfide and carbon nanocomposites with unique yolk shell structures is an effective strategy but also remains a great challenge. In this work, we reported a facile approach to synthesize the unique yolk-shell FeS2@carbon (FeS2@C) spheres via calcination treatment of the resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin-coated Prussian blue (FeFe PB) core-shell spheres in Ar atmosphere and a subsequent sulfidation treatment. The synthetic method herein was quite simple and convenient. Such unique structure design could effectively prevent the large volume expansion and dissolution of the active materials in the electrolytes during lithiation. As expected, the yolk-shell FeS2@C spheres exhibited good electrochemical performance as anode materials for LIBs, which displayed a high discharge capacity of 560 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) for 100 cycles. When the current density increased to 1000 mA g(-1), a reversible discharge capacity of 269 mA h g(-1) was still retained after 500 cycles. The present work demonstrated an extraordinary synthetic strategy to construct transition metal sulfide and carbon nanocomposites with unique yolk shell structure. In addition, this RF resin coating strategy can be further extended to synthesize other RF resin-coated PB analogue (PBA) core -shell nanostructures, demonstrating the generality of this RF resin coating strategy.

TI Activating C-Coordinated Iron of Iron Hexacyanoferrate for Zn Hybrid-Ion
   Batteries with 10 000-Cycle Lifespan and Superior Rate Capability
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-type metal hexacyanoferrates are considered as significant cathodes for zinc batteries (ZBs). However, these PBA-type cathodes, such as cyanogroup iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF), suffer from ephemeral lifespan (<= 1000 cycles), and inferior rate capability (1 A g(-1)). This is because the redox active sites of multivalent iron (Fe(III/II)) can only be very limited activated and thus utilized. This is attributed to the spatial resistance caused by the compact cooperation interaction between Fe and the surrounded cyanogroup, and the inferior conductivity. Here, it is found that high-voltage scanning can effectively activate the C-coordinated Fe in FeHCF cathode in ZBs. Thanks to this activation, the Zn-FeHCF hybrid-ion battery achieves a record-breaking cycling performance of 5000 (82% capacity retention) and 10 000 cycles (73% capacity retention), respectively, together with a superior rate capability of maintaining 53.2% capacity at superhigh current density of 8 A g(-1) (approximate to 97 C). The reversible distortion and recovery of the crystalline structure caused by the (de)insertion of zinc and lithium ions is revealed. It is believed that this work represents a substantial advance on PBA electrode materials and may essentially promote application of PBA materials.

TI Activated carbon-supported multi-doped graphene as high-efficient
   catalyst to modify air cathode in microbial fuel cells
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB It is difficult to apply microbial fuel cells (MFCs) basing on activated carbon air cathode in practical application because of the low efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction. Thus, exploring high-efficient catalyst to improve the cathode performance is of emergent significance. Herein, we synthesize an activated carbon-supported Fe-Ag-N multi-doped graphene as the air cathode catalyst in MFCs via a simple preparation and calcination of Fe-Ag prussian blue analogues. As proved, the designed catalyst contributes to the decrease of the cathode's diffusion resistance and charge transfer resistance; mean-while it immensely promotes the kinetics towards ORR by accelerating the migration of electron from the encapsulated bimetals to the surrounding carbon structure, indicating that the deposit of multi-doped graphene catalyst reinforces the cathode's conductivity and expedites the electron transfer process. The output power performances indicate that a highest maximum power density reaches up to 1956.45 mWm(-2), which is 7 times higher than that of the control, foreboding the catalyst's potential application in MFCs.

TI Construction of Co-NC@Mo2C hetero-interfaces for improving the
   performance of Li-O2 batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) are becoming the rising stars of a new generation of energy storage devices due to high theoretical energy density. The crucial factor of its high performance and stability is developing efficient cathode electro-catalysts. In this work, the Zn3[Co (CN)6]2 Prussian Blue analog (Zn-CoPBA) was used as the precursor, then ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate was incorporated by hydrothermal treatment, and finally Mo2C-modified Co-NC was prepared by one-step pyrolysis. The mesoporous hetero-interfaces of N-doped carbon matrix embedded by Mo2C/Co nano-heterostructures facilitate the transport of substances, provide more catalytic active sites and storage space for the discharge product Li2O2 due to the characteristic electronic structure and catalytic properties of Mo2C with d-orbital state distribution near the noble metal-like Fermi level. The composite Co-NC@Mo2C was used for LOBs cathode catalyst, it presents wonderful charge-discharge specific capacities (21,930 mA h g - 1), stable cycling performance.

TI Effect of the Interaction between Transition Metal Redox Center and
   Cyanide Ligand on Structural Evolution in Prussian White Cathodes
SO ACS NANO
AB Transition metal (TM) based Prussian whites, comprising a cyanide anion ((C equivalent to N)(-)) and TM cations in an alternative manner, have been widely adopted as cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. Prussian whites are characterized by the TM electronic states that exclusively adopt low spin (LS) toward the C atom and high spin (HS) toward the N atom through the hybridized covalent bonding in the TM & horbar;C equivalent to N & horbar;TM unit with the average oxidation states of the TM ions being 2+, considerably affecting the phase transition behavior upon the release and storage of carrier ions; however, there have been only a few studies on their associated features. Herein, Prussian whites with different HS TM ions were synthesized via coprecipitation and the phase transition behavior controlled by the pi electron interaction between the cyanide anions and TM ions during battery operations was investigated. In situ X-ray characterizations reveal that the combined effect of pi backdonation in the LS Fe-C unit and pi donation in the HS TM-N unit effectively controls the bond length of the TM & horbar;C equivalent to N & horbar;TM building unit, thus markedly influencing the lattice volume of a series of Prussian white cathodes during the charge/discharge process. This study presents a comprehensive understanding of the structure-property relationship of the Prussian white cathodes involving pi electron interactions during battery operations.

TI A low-temperature sintered heterostructure solid film of coordination
   polymer nanoparticles: an electron-rectifier function based on partially
   oxidised/reduced conductor phases of Prussian blue
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Inks of surface-modified nanoparticles (NPs) are a promising fluid for fabricating thin-film electronic devices; however, such NPs are still functionally discrete from each other. Therefore, reconstituting electronic communication among the NPs has been a challenging subject for their nanoscale interfacial assembly. Here, we demonstrate the reconstitution (sintering) ability of surface-modified Prussian blue (PB) and its Ni-replaced analogue (Ni-PBA) NPs that lead to multilayer electronic functions. A double-layer (DL) rigid solid film of the PB (bottom layer) and the Ni-PBA (top layer) NPs has been successfully fabricated on indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrates by a spin-coating technique using their water inks and a low-temperature sintering process between 120 and 150 degrees C to immobilise the spin-coated NPs without serious mismatch on the heterostructure DL interface. The DL solid films act as an electron-rectifier device, which is entirely characterised by a PB bottom layer with a minimum nanoscale thickness of similar to 20 nm. In the mechanism of the electron-rectifier phenomenon, we reveal the appearance of theoretically predicted partially oxidised/reduced conductor phases of PB.

TI Graphene aerogel encapsulated double carbon shell CoFe@C@C nanocubes for
   construction of high performance microwave absorbing materials
SO CARBON
AB Recently, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have attracted much attention due to their transformation into dielectric/ magnetic coupled composites after pyrolysis at high temperatures and their ability to maintain their basic morphology. However, designing efficient microwave-absorbing materials using PBAs is still a challenge. In this work, Co - Fe PBA was prepared by wet chemical method and graphene aerogel-encapsulated double carbon-shell CoFe@C@C nanocubes (CFCCG) were prepared by stirred self-polymerization and hydrothermal method, and heat-treated at different temperatures to obtain composites consisting of core-shell-structured PBA-derived particles encapsulated in a double layer of graphene and polydopamine (PDA). The addition of graphene not only reduces the density of the derived material but also effectively disperses the CoFe@C@C nanocubes to prevent the generated highly conductive carbon layer from adhering to improve the impedance matching, as well as introduces a large number of heterogeneous interfaces to improve the loss capability. Thanks to which the CFCCG7 composites have a reflection loss of -66.33 dB and an effective microwave absorption frequency covering the entire Ku -band. This work provides a new approach for rational design of multilayer carbon structure-coated PBA-based microwave absorbing materials.

TI Zeolitic imidazolate framework/Prussian blue analogue derived
   CoSe2/FeSe2 heterostructure for long-cycle
   aluminum-ion batteries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
AB Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) have been considered a low-cost, safe and high energy density candidate for large-scale electrochemical energy storage systems. Here, we utilize the concept of interface engineering to synthesize a CoSe2/FeSe2 heterostructure cathode through MOF-on-MOF heteroepitaxial growth. The presence of an internal electric field between the CoSe2 and FeSe2 phases induces a synergistic effect to achieve rapid charge transfer and ion diffusion, which enables a facile conversion reaction based on Co2+/Co-0 and Fe2+/Fe-0. The CoSe2/FeSe2 heterostructure displays an initial discharge capacity of 356.9 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). After 1600 cycles at 200 mA g(-1), the reversible capacity is 133.7 mA g(-1). Theoretical calculation also demonstrates that the designed CoSe2/FeSe2 heterostructure can significantly promote the directional electron transfer and reduce the aluminum-ion migration barrier energy. Therefore, the concept of heterostructure cathodes provides a strategy to develop long-cycle life AIBs.

TI Sub-micrometer particle size effects on metastable phases for a
   photoswitchable Co-Fe Prussian blue analog
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Metastable phases of the photoswitchable molecular magnet K0.3Co[Fe(CN)(6)](0.77) . nH(2)O in sub-micrometer particles have been structurally investigated by synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements. The K0.3Co[Fe(CN)(6)](0.77) . nH(2)O bulk compound (studied here with a sample having average particle size of 500 nm) undergoes a charge transfer coupled spin transition (CTCST), where spin configurations change between a paramagnetic Co-II (S = 3/2) -Fe-III (S = 1/2) high-temperature (HT) state and a diamagnetic Co-III (S = 0) -Fe-II (S = 0) low-temperature (LT) state. The bulk compound exhibits a unique intermediate (IM) phase, which corresponds to a mixture of HT and LT spin states that depend on the cooling rate. Several hidden metastable HT states emerge as a function of thermal and photo stimuli, namely: (1) a quench (Q) state generated from the HT state by flash cooling, (2) a LTPX state obtained by photoexcitation from the LT state derived by thermal relaxation from the Q state, and (3) an IMPX state accessed by photo-irradiation from the IM state. A sample with a smaller particle size, 135 nm, is investigated for which the particles are on the scale of the coherent LT domains in the IM phase within the larger 500 nm sample. PXRD studies under controlled thermal and/or optical excitations have clarified that the reduction of the particle size profoundly affects the structural changes associated with the CTCST. The unusual IM state is also observed as segregated domains in the 135 nm particle, but the collective structural transformations are more hindered in small particles. The volume change decreases to 2%-3%, almost half the value found for 500 nm particles (5%-8%), even though the linear thermal expansion coefficients are larger for the smaller particles. Furthermore, photoexcitation from the IM and LT states does not turn into single phases in the smaller particles, presumably because of the multiple interfaces and/or internal stress generated by the coexistence of small Co-II-Fe-III and Co-III-Fe-II domains in the lattice. Since the reduced particle size limits cooperativity and domain growth in the lattice, CTCST in the small particle sample becomes less sensitive to external stimuli.

TI The uptake mechanism of palladium ions into Prussian-blue nanoparticles
   in a nitric acid solution toward application for the recycling of
   precious metals from electronic and nuclear wastes
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB We have investigated the uptake mechanism of palladium (Pd: one of the most important elements in industry used as a catalyst) ions into Prussian-blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) in a nitric acid solution via high-resolution electron transmission microscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectroscopy in combination with first principles calculations. Comparison of the structural and electronic properties of PBNPs between before and after a 24 h sorption test reveals that the Pd2+ ions incorporated into PBNPs by the substitution of Fe2+ ions of the PB framework while maintaining the crystal structure, and the substitution efficiency is estimated to be 87% per PB unit cell. This implies that 0.30 g of Pd can be recovered by using 1 g of PB having the chemical formula KFe(iii)[Fe(ii)(CN)(6)]. The present finding suggests that PB (or its analogues) can be applied to recycle noble and rare metals from electronic and nuclear wastes.

TI Dual-mode colorimetric-fluorometric - fluorometric immunoassay for
   foodborne parasitic infection
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Immunoassays are the primary method used for detection of foodborne parasitic infection. The nanomaterials used in these assays often present challenges such as complex preparation requirements and low stability during long-term storage and transport. Herein, based on cost-effective K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]-mediated in-situ generated CuFe Prussian blue analogues (CuFe-PBA) and quinoxaline derivatives with high fluorescence, a dual-mode immunoassay was proposed for foodborne parasitic infection. This platform is relied on the restoration of K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] by ascorbic acid (AA). In addition to this process, K-4[Fe(CN)(6)]-triggered the generation of CuFe-PBA, and the enhanced fluorogenic reaction of dehydrogenated AA and o-phenylenediamine (OPD) occur sequentially. Without complex probes preparation, the assay enabled the rapid on-site detection of ALP and foodborne parasitic infection through a colorimetric mode accessible via smartphone and offered enhanced sensitivity through a fluorescent mode. The method was used for the detection of ALP, achieving detection limits of 0.38 U/L and 0.03 U/L for colorimetric and fluorescence modes, respectively. Subsequently, the dual-mode immunoassay was applied to Trichinella spiralis infection. The sensitivity and specificity of both the colorimetric and fluorescence modes were 100 % in 950 pig serum samples. This immunosensor provides a universal analysis tool for the accurate, cost-effective and highly sensitive detection of foodborne parasitic infection.

TI Optimizing coupling effect of confined FeNi nanoalloys within graphitic
   carbon nanofibers to improve photothermal energy conversion efficiency
   for solar water purification
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Sustainable and energy-efficient water purification by harnessing solar energy is critical to tackling the challenges of water scarcity and the on-going water pollution crisis. Nevertheless, the biggest challenge to the practical deployment of solar-driven water purification, however, continues to be the poor solar evaporation efficiency of materials. Herein, FeNi nanoalloys encapsulated in graphitic carbon nanofibers (FeNi3/CNF) using Prussian blue analogue (PBAs) derivatives were fabricated using electrospinning and carbonization. The PBAs metal precursors play a critical role in encapsulating and safeguarding the FeNi alloy nanostructures from oxidation and agglomeration challenges. Furthermore, the synergistic effects between the non-noble hybrid plasmonic nanoalloys and graphitic CNFs can be constructed and optimized from the mass loading of PBAs precursor. Benefiting from the broad solar absorption band, high specific surface area, abundant micromesopores, and well-organized interlayer channel, the resultant 2D FeNi3/CNF solar evaporator demonstrates an efficient water evaporation rate of 1.51 kg m -2h- 1 with an outstanding solar evaporation efficiency of 93.3 % under one sun irradiation, among the best values reported thus far. Impressively, the resultant 2D FeNi3/CNF solar evaporator can be constructed using only 0.02 kg m- 2 loading of photothermal materials without compromising evaporation performance, which highlights its cost-efficiency in the practical application. Furthermore, the desalinated water meets the drinking standards of the World Health Organization (WHO) with an efficient 99 % separation of multiple organic industrial dye pollutants. Hence, this work demonstrates an efficient cost-effective approach to novel non-noble plasmonic alloy-based metal-carbon composites for enhanced solar-driven interfacial evaporation and wastewater purification.

TI Spin state modulation and kinetic control of thermal contraction in a
   [Fe2Co2] discrete Prussian blue analogue
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Stimuli-responsive switchable molecules represent an important category of magnetic materials with significant potential for functional devices. However, engineering complexes with controlled switchability remains challenging due to their sensitivity to lattice interactions. Herein, we report a [Fe2Co2] square complex [FeTp(CN)3]2[Co{(F5-Ph)Py}2]2<middle dot>2ClO4<middle dot>4CH3OH<middle dot>2H2O {1<middle dot>4CH3OH<middle dot>2H2O; (F5-Ph)Py = (Z)-N '-(perfluorophenyl) picolinimidamide and Tp = hydrotris(1-pyrazolyl)borate}, tailored with hydrogen bonding (HB) donor and acceptor moieties for effective lattice interactions. The alteration in HB interactions in crystal phases obtained via single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SC-SC) transformation (i.e., 1<middle dot>4CH3OH<middle dot>2H2O <-> 1<middle dot>2H2O <-> 1) led to a remarkable change in magnetic properties. Complexes 1<middle dot>4CH3OH<middle dot>2H2O and 1 possess [FeIILS(mu-CN)CoIIILS] and [FeIIILS(mu-CN)CoIIHS] configurations, respectively. Meanwhile, 1<middle dot>2H2O demonstrates multi-responsive (thermo-, photo- and pressure) reversible two-step electron transfer coupled spin transition (ETCST) accompanied by thermal contraction and expansion. The complete diamagnetic [FeIILS(mu-CN)CoIIILS] configuration in 1<middle dot>2H2O was obtained at an intermediate temperature accompanied by thermal contraction, an unusual behaviour observed for the first time in cyanide-bridged systems. Additionally, 1<middle dot>2H2O displayed temperature-induced excited spin state trapping (TIESST) of similar to 70% of the paramagnetic [FeIIILS(mu-CN)CoIIHS] configuration at low temperatures. The isothermal relaxation of the thermally trapped paramagnetic state shows a much faster and complete conversion to a diamagnetic state at similar to 140 K, compared to the relaxation observed at other temperatures (100-190 K), corroborating the observed unique magnetic behaviour. Hence, this result provides valuable insight into the strategic design of complexes with enhanced and controlled switchability for potential applications such as actuators and sensors.

TI Core-shell nanoparticles of Prussian blue analogues as efficient
   capacitive deionization electrodes for brackish water desalination
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) has recently drawn much attention, which is considered as an effective electrochemical technology for brackish water desalination. Sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (NaFeHCF) as a novel kind of electrode based on reversibly electrochemical redox reactions to store ions is proposed lately to make an application in CDI. However, the inevitable disadvantages of NaFeHCF are low deionization capacity and poor cycling stability due to the structural collapse during the process of Na+ intercalation/deintercalation. Herein, we made an attemption to encapsulate NaFeHCF with sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate (NaNiHCF) by a facile method in which the highly stable NaNiHCF at shell portion could protect the core from irreversible structural change to improve desalination capacity and cycling stability. Electrochemical analysis was carried out to investigate the electrochemical performance of the composite in-depth and the established CDI units displayed a specific capacitance as high as 138.15 F g(-1) at 0.5 mA cm(-2), low charge-transfer resistance and superior electrochemical stability. Moreover, high adsorption amount of 59.38 mg g(-1) and energy consumption of 2.34 kg NaCl/kWh in 50 mM NaCl were observed during the deionization tests, and it remained 87% of initial desalination capacity after 50 cycles. These results indicate that NaNiHCF @ NaFeHCF with core-shell heterostructure is a promising electrode for brackish water desalination.

TI Fe (PB)-P-Se NANOCUBES AS HER ELECTROCATALYSTS FOR OVERALL EFFICIENT
   WATER-SPLITTING
SO DIGEST JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS AND BIOSTRUCTURES
AB In recent times, selecting an effective electrocatalyst has attracted a lot of attention for improving the efficiency of water splitting to obtain clean fuels as an energy carrier. In this study, a self-pattern strategy is reported to synthesize Selenide (Se)-Phosphate (P) mixed Prussian blue (PB) cubic nanocubes for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The as-prepared nanocubes were characterized by different techniques. SEM and TEM confirm that the nanocube structure has been successfully formed. XRD pattern obtained peaks meets with the standard JCPDS no. 01-0239.The resulting P-Se mixed nanocubes worked as a superior HER electrocatalyst, which affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 210mV; at the overpotential of 211mV; a Tafel slope as 147 mV/dec in 1M KOH; and excellent stability in alkaline medium. From results, we affirmed that Prussian based nanocubes can work with great potential in water splitting.

TI Dual-salt assisted synergistic synthesis of Prussian white cathode
   towards high-capacity and long cycle potassium ion battery
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are considered as superior cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) because of their three-dimensional open framework structure, high stability, and low cost. However, the intrinsic lattice defects and low potassium content typically results in poor rate and cycling performance, thus limited their practical applications. In this work, high-quality K1.64FeFe(CN)6 (PW-HQ) material with less crystalline water (6.21%) and high potassium content (1.64 mol-1) was successfully synthesized by a novel coprecipitation method with potassium citrate (K-CA) and potassium chloride (KCl) addition. Specifically, the electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 113.1 mA h g-1 at the current rate of 50 mA g-1 with-100% coulombic efficiency. Besides, the electrode retained 90% reversible capac-ity at 500 mA g-1 current density after 1000 cycles, indicating only 0.01% capacity decay per cycle. Moreover, we have revealed that the introduction of K-CA controlled the chelating rate of Fe(II) and the addition of KCl increased the K+ content, hence improving the capacity and stability of the as -prepared electrodes. Structural evolution and potassium storage mechanism were further investigated by detailed ex-situ X-ray diffraction and in-situ Raman measurements, which demonstrated reversible potassiation/depotassiation behavior and negligible volume change during the electrochemical process. In general, this work provides an efficient strategy to eliminate water contents in Prussian blue cathode and improve its electrochemical performance, which plays a key role in promoting the industrialization of potassium ion batteries.

TI Air-Stable Prussian White Cathode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries
   Enabled by ZnO Surface Modification
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Iron-based Prussian white (PW) is one of the promising cathodes for sodium-ion batteries, owing to its high capacity and low cost. However, the practical application of PW is hindered by its poor air stability. The metal-oxide coating has been proven to be an effective way to improve the air stability of electrode materials. Whereas, the target electrode materials conventionally need to be dissolved in the aqueous solution to obtain precursor composites and subsequently calcined at a high temperature during the metal-oxide coating process, which could destroy the phase structure of PW as a result of the sodium leaching into the water and thermal decomposition at the high temperature. In this work, we propose a facile method to construct a ZnO surface layer on PW by utilizing ethanol as a solvent and a mild post-treatment temperature. The ZnO coating layer effectively enhances the air stability of PW and induces the formation of the stable interface on PW. The PW-5 wt % ZnO-E (exposed in 60% humidity air after 30 days) cathode demonstrates a much higher capacity retention (94.1%) at 1 C after 200 cycles than that of PW-E (54%). This work lays a solid foundation for further application of PW.

TI Chemical reduction of Prussian blue nanocubes to obtain alkali ion
   containing cathodes and their battery applications
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
AB A facile process for the preparation of alkali ion containing Prussian blue cathodes by chemical reduction and their battery applications are reported. Two cathodes, LixFe[Fe(CN)(6)] and NaxFe[Fe(CN)(6)], have been prepared through chemical lithiation/sodiation of Fe[Fe(CN6)] through a rapid (<10 min) and low temperature process (<100 degrees C). Structural analysis confirmed that the as-prepared Fe[Fe(CN)(6)], lithiated and sodiated compounds maintained a cubic structure. Nano-sized cuboidal morphology was confirmed by electron microscopy and it was unaffected by the chemical lithiation/sodiation process. Based on the first cycle electrochemical capacity, it is realized that chemical sodiation into Fe[Fe(CN6)] is more efficient than lithiation. The sodiated Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] showed a capacity retention of about 70% after 500 cycles with 78 mA h g(-1) discharge capacity at 100 mA g(-1) for sodium ion battery applications. On the other hand, lithiated Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] showed a better capacity retention of 92% after 300 cycles with 111 mA h g(-1) discharge capacity at 100 mA g(-1) for lithium ion battery applications. Ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis of the electrodes at the end of the first charge, at the end of the first cycle and at the end of 5 cycles was carried out and the results were compared with those of the as-sodiated NaxFe[Fe(CN)(6)] electrode. This investigation confirmed that for the chemically sodiated electrode a cubic phase at the end of the first charge transformed to a monoclinic structure at the end of discharge (first cycle and at the end of the 5(th) cycle). The cubic to monoclinic structural phase transition is identified to be happening at the threshold sodium concentration around x = 1.3 in NaxFe[Fe(CN)(6)]. These results are correlated with ex situ surface chemical analysis. Such a cost-effective chemical reduction process to achieve a sodium-rich phase has not been reported so far to the best of our knowledge.

TI Ultrafast and large scale preparation of superior catalyst for oxygen
   evolution reaction
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The development of efficient and earth abundant catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key challenge for the renewable energy research community. Here, we report a facile and ultrafast route to immobilize nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanoparticles on nickel foam (NF) via soaking the direct electroless deposited prussian blue analogue (PBA) on NF in 1 M KOH. This NiFe-LDH/NF electrode can be prepared in a few seconds without further treatments. It has three-dimensional interpenetrating network originated from its PBA precursor which facilitate the diffusion and ad/desorption of the reactants and producing for OER. And further characterization of the Faradaic efficiency and forced convection tests show direct evidence to demonstrate the formation of free intermediate(s) in the OER process. This electrode (typically NiFe-LDH-20s/NF) exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential of similar to 0.240 V at 10 mA cm(-2), low Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), and great stability. This feasible strategy affords a new strategy for the large scale manufacture of low-cost, effective and robust OER electrodes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Polygonal CuS Nanoprisms Fabricated by Grinding Reaction for Advanced
   Quasi-Solid-State Asymmetry Supercapacitors
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB The construction of advanced electrode materials with well-connected channels and a satisfactory specific surface area for energy storage techniques, such as supercapacitors, is promising but still challenging. Herein, applying the copper Prussian blue analogue (CuFe-PBA) as the precursor, a polygonal prism-like CuS was synthesized through a grinding method at ambient temperature. The reaction between CuFe-PBA and Na2S led to the substitution of S2- for [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), and then, CuS was obtained. Benefitting from the porous precursor, the increased electrochemically active surface area enabled CuS to fully expose the electrochemically active sites and facilitated the effective contact between them and the electrolyte. Moreover, the energy storage mechanism was investigated based on ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that both the copper and sulfur in CuS are electrochemically active sites, contributing to the distinguished specific capacitance. When used as a negative electrode, the as-fabricated CuS showed the excellent specific capacitance of 1850 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). Then, a quasi-solid-state asymmetry supercapacitor was assembled with CuS as the negative electrode and CuFe-PBA as the positive electrode, possessing an energy density of 56.01 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 250.05 W kg(-1). Furthermore, the capacitance retention of the asymmetry supercapacitor after 5000 cycles is 83.3%, showing good cycle stability. This work provides an effective strategy toward the design of CuS negative electrode materials with continuously connected channels and outstanding electrochemical properties for energy storage applications.

TI Amorphization of nanostructured prussian blue analogues for boosting
   oxygen evolution reaction toward design of efficient electrocatalysts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Facile incorporation of crystal defects or creating amorphous phase into crystalline functional materials can significantly alter their characteristics leading to boost new technological advances and applications. Herein, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) nanoparticles (NPs) and its derivatives synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method, and thermally cured in nitrogen and air atmospheres. The formed cubic nickel-iron framework crystals and their derivatives explored for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via modification of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Expressively, thermal curing of NiHCF in nitrogen and air create variable crystal defects leading to control amorphization at reasonably high temperatures. The NiHCF nanocrystals show overpotentials (h10) of 330 mV for OER at GC/N300 (NiHCF treated at 300 degrees C in N2) in alkaline medium. Fascinatingly, the results explored the synergistic action for iron/nickel sites and their oxidation states in the NiHCF crystals for OER with superior stability for more than 10 h.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI Regulation of asymmetric bimetallic NiFe sites boost fast desolvation
   kinetics for long-cycling ammonium-ion storage
SO ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS
AB Aqueous ammonium ion battery (AAIB) is a new type of energy storage device with non-metallic ion (NH4+) as the carrier, possessing the apparent advantages of low cost, high safety, and long-term sustainability. However, the sluggish kinetics of the electrolyte-electrode interface often results in a slow NH4+ transport within the host structure, leading to poor cycling stability, especially in the type of cathode material with open frameworks represented by Fe-based Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). In this work, a NiFe-PBA (NiFe) cathode material with asymmetric bimetallic sites is purposely designed to regulate and improve the NH4+ desolvation kinetics at the electrolyte-electrode interface. Theoretical simulations first reveal that regulating the asymmetric bimetallic site effectively reduces the energy barrier of NH4+(H2O)(4) desolvation at the electrolyte-electrode interface, and thus the NH4+(H2O)(4) can be desolvated into NH4+ into host material. The electrochemical study results further show that the successful introduction of asymmetric bimetallic sites largely improves the diffusion kinetics and structural stability of FeFe-PBA (FeFe), realizing stable cycling performance (97 % retention after 700 cycles at 0.25 A g(-1)) and high-rate capability. Finally, in-situ characterizations in combination with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the insertion/extraction of NH4+ is attributed to the charge storage mechanism of reversible interactions in association with the coordination of N atoms in the NiFe-PBA.

   That Catalyzes Water Oxidation under Visible Light
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB An entirely earth-abundant chromophore-relay water oxidation catalyst triad system, which is robust and efficient at neutral pH, is presented. The synthesis involves the coordination of a porphyrin derivative to a bridging Fe(CN)(5) group, which is then reacted with Co ions to prepare a covalently linked chromophore-Prussian blue analogue assembly. Light-driven water oxidation studies in the presence of an electron scavenger indicate that the triad is active and it maintains a steady activity for at least three hours. Transient absorption experiments and computational studies reveal that the Fe(CN)(5) group is more than a linker as it takes part in electron-transfer and co-operates with porphyrin in the charge separation process.

TI A High-Rate Electrode with Grotthuss Topochemistry for Membrane-Free
   Decoupled Acid Water Electrolysis
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Water electrolysis powered by renewable energies is regarded as the most promising technology for hydrogen production. However, in conventional acid water electrolysis, the H-2 production and O-2 production are tightly coupled and the proton exchange membrane is required to prevent the gases mixing, which reduce the flexibility of this technology and increase its cost. Here, a low-cost hydrated Prussian blue analog (Turnbull's blue) electrode is introduced as a solid-state redox mediator to decouple the acid water electrolysis into two steps without the use of membrane. The redox mediator shows high-rate performance (42.7 mAh g(-1) at 120 A g(-1)) and long cycle life (5000 cycles), which is owing to the diffusion-free Grotthuss proton conduction. Moreover, this decoupled water electrolysis device facilitates the utilization of renewable energies for high-purity hydrogen production at different spaces and times, which shows the high flexibility for H-2 production.

TI Prussian blue analogues anchored P-(Ni,Co)Se2 nanoarrays for
   high performance all-solid-state supercapacitor
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Nanostructure construction and composition tuning are two effective methods to accelerate electrochemical reaction kinetics and increase electroactive sites of nickel cobalt selenides nanoarrays. Herein, we have successfully designed and fabricated the P-(Ni,Co)Se-2 nanoarrays on activated carbon cloth with PBAs nanocubes anchored on the nanoflakes-nanowires by a facile hydrothermal method, followed precipitate reaction and phosphorization/selenylation treatment. The continuous hollow PBAs nanocubes and proper P incorporation in (Ni,Co)Se-2 could greatly increase active surface area and enhance the ions diffusion and charge transfer. The resultant P-(Ni,Co)Se-2 NAs electrode delivers a high areal capacity of 3.02C cm(-2) (a specific capacity of 755C g(-1)) at 2 mA cm(-2) and a good rate capability (2.61C cm(-2) at 30 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, the all-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor device is also constructed by using P-(Ni,Co)Se-2 NAs and ZIF-8 derived carbon as positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively, which shows a high energy density of 45.0 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 446.3 W kg(-1). This work offers new strategies to synthesize transition nickel cobalt selenides for high performance supercapacitor devices.

TI Fe3O4 nanospheres deposited on Prussian blue
   analogue-derived Ni-Co/CNTs networks for electromagnetic wave absorption
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB In the current work, Ni-Co/CNTs networks were firstly produced by a simple annealing treatment of Ni-Co PBA, which was then used as a carbon-based carrier and successfully deposited Fe3O4 nanospheres via a classic hy-drothermal reaction process. Additionally, the electromagnetic wave absorption performances of composites could be effectively affected by adjusting the mass ratio of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of-48.76 dB was achieved for Fe3O4@Ni-Co/CNTs-1# at 3.5 mm thickness. Meanwhile, Fe3O4@Ni-Co/ CNTs-2# exhibited a wide effective absorption band (EAB) of 5.9 GHz (12.1-18 GHz) at a 2.0 mm matching thickness, suggesting that the Fe3O4@Ni-Co/CNTs composites were a promising absorber for electromagnetic wave absorption materials. Based on the synergistic effects of dielectric and magnetic losses generated by Ni-Co/ CNTs and Fe3O4, respectively, and appropriately matched impedances, a new strategy for fabricating light-weight, thin-thickness, strong absorption, and wide-bandwidth materials was provided.

TI Synchronous regulation of Schottky/p-n dual junction in Prussian
   blue-derived Janus heterostructures: A path to ultrafast long life
   potassium ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Practical applications of conversion-type metal selenide electrodes in potassium ion batteries (PIBs) encounter multiple challenges, such as particle aggregation, the shuttle effect, and pulverization during cycling. We design a Janus heterostructure, namely CoSe2-FeSe2/graphite/N-doped carbon (CFS//g@NC), with dual heterojunctions (p-n and Schottky junction), which generates the synergistic effect to enhance interface charge storage and improve electrode structure integrity. When the Janus heterostructure is used as a PIB anode, it demonstrates high-rate performance up to 10 A/g, offering a capacity of 200 mA h g-1 and excellent cycling stability of over 2500 cycles at 0.5 A/g. According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the diffusion barrier of K ions on CFS//g@NC is two times lower than that on CoSe2 or FeSe2. The distribution of n-type and p-type semiconductors in the Janus particles has been confirmed by quantitative assessment through dark-field electron microscopy. In addition to the p-n junction crossing two semiconductor interfaces, the Schottky junction between the graphite layer derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBA) and the semiconductor also creates a built-in electric field, thus enhancing ion/electron transport and increasing the diffusion of potassium ions. This work provides new insights into the architectural strategy of multi-layer heterointerfaces and offers a promising new pathway for anode design in PIBs.

However, challenges such as unsatisfactory active site utilization, low conductivity, and abundant structural vacancies have impeded fulfillment of their potential. In this work, a conductive in-plane porous MXene is for the first time adopted as a multifunctional host material to enhance cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) growth and crystallinity. Particularly, the uniform surface charges on MXene are identified to induce anisotropic and highly crystalline CoHCF, which are critical to alleviating the practical drawbacks associated with the PBAs family. Empowered by the targeted modification, the CoHCF nanotube/MXene composite realizes high surface area and low defectiveness, resulting in an impressive capacity of 197 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and capacity retention of 95.3% over 3000 cycles at 2.0 A g-1. X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) reveal that CoC bonds in the heterostructure facilitate rapid electron/Zn-ion transfer, enhancing Zn storage kinetics. To validate practical applicability, pouch cells incorporating Zn|CoHCF/MXene are further examined. This composition strategy, utilizing MXene as a multifunctional template, enhances the surface area, conductivity, and crystallinity of PBAs as cathodes for ZIBs, showcasing the significant potential for large-scale energy storage applications.

TI Trifunctional robust electrocatalysts based on 3D Fe/N-doped carbon
   nanocubes encapsulating Co4N nanoparticles for efficient
   battery-powered water electrolyzers
SO CARBON ENERGY
AB Herein, we have designed a highly active and robust trifunctional electrocatalyst derived from Prussian blue analogs, where Co4N nanoparticles are encapsulated by Fe embedded in N-doped carbon nanocubes to synthesize hierarchically structured Co4N@Fe/N-C for rechargeable zinc-air batteries and overall water-splitting electrolyzers. As confirmed by theoretical and experimental results, the high intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction activities of Co4N@Fe/N-C were attributed to the formation of the heterointerface and the modulated local electronic structure. Moreover, Co4N@Fe/N-C induced improvement in these trifunctional electrocatalytic activities owing to the hierarchical hollow nanocube structure, uniform distribution of Co4N, and conductive encapsulation by Fe/N-C. Thus, the rechargeable zinc-air battery with Co4N@Fe/N-C delivers a high specific capacity of 789.9 mAh g(-1) and stable voltage profiles over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the overall water electrolyzer with Co4N@Fe/N-C achieved better durability and rate performance than that with the Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts, delivering a high Faradaic efficiency of 96.4%. Along with the great potential of the integrated water electrolyzer powered by a zinc-air battery for practical applications, therefore, the mechanistic understanding and active site identification provide valuable insights into the rational design of advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.

TI Entropy-Mediated Stable Structural Evolution of Prussian White Cathodes
   for Long-Life Na-Ion Batteries
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB The high-entropy approach is applied to monoclinic Prussian White (PW) Na-ion cathodes to address the issue of unfavorable multilevel phase transitions upon electrochemical cycling, leading to poor stability and capacity decay. A series of Mn-based samples with up to six metal species sharing the N-coordinated positions was synthesized. The material of composition Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.920.08 & sdot; 1.09H2O was found to exhibit superior cyclability over medium/low-entropy and conventional single-metal PWs. We also report, to our knowledge for the first time, that a high-symmetry crystal structure may be advantageous for high-entropy PWs during battery operation. Computational comparisons of the formation enthalpy demonstrate that the compositionally less complex materials are prone to phase transitions, which negatively affect cycling performance. Based on data from complementary characterization techniques, an intrinsic mechanism for the stability improvement of the disordered PW structure upon Na+ insertion/extraction is proposed, namely the dual effect of suppression of phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution.
   The high-entropy approach is applied to a monoclinic Prussian White (PW), yielding a promising cathode material (Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.920.08 & sdot; 1.09H2O) for Na-ion battery applications. Comparison of the structural and chemical properties of high-, medium- and low-entropy Mn-based PWs reveals the performance benefits arising from increased configurational entropy, namely suppression of phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution during cycling.image

TI 3D porous carbon network-reinforced defective CoFeOx@C as a
   high-rate electrode for lithium-ion batteries
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB Integrating metal oxides with three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon is extremely desirable for improving the capacity and cyclability of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein 3D porous carbon network (3DPCN)-reinforced composite electrodes were developed by integrating biomass (i.e., agaric)-derived 3DPCN and Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-generated carbon-coated metal oxides (CoFeOx@C). To achieve an integrated structure, PBA precursors were directly deposited and grown on 3DPCN (PBA/3DPCN), and then, PBA/3DPCN was subjected to low-temperature oxidation in air and thermal treatment in Ar to yield double carbon-modified metal oxides (CoFeOx@C/C). The interconnected CoFeOx@C/C electrode, as an advanced anode of LIBs, delivers excellent capacity and cyclability, with typical specific capacities of 1043.4 mAh g(-1 )at 0.2 A g(-1 ) and 483.2 mAh g-1 at as high as 5.0 A g-1 after 120 cycles. This superior electrochemical performance originates from the interconnected structure of 3DPCN, the finely regulated composition of nanosized CoFeOx@C, and the tight contact and syn-ergistic effect between 3DPCN and CoFeOx@C. The 3DPCN not only provides a void space for buffering the volume change of CoFeOx@C but also acts as a framework for improving the conductivity of the entire electrode, while compositionally optimized defective CoFeOx@C contributes the majority of the specific capacity. Our work paves the way to overcome the drawbacks (e.g., low electronic conductivity, self-aggregation, and low rate capability) of metal oxides as electrodes of LIBs.

TI The Nature of the Ultrahigh Initial Coulombic Efficiency of
   Ni2Fe(CN)6 in Aqueous Ammonium-Ion Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB As a member of Prussian blue analogs, insoluble ferrocyanides encounter a problem wherein their initial Coulombic efficiencies are frequently higher than 100% when those values should be lower than 100% under normal circumstances. Herein, we study the topochemistry of NH4+ in Ni2Fe(CN)(6) during the electrochemical reaction and meet the same problem. The initial Coulombic efficiency of Ni2Fe(CN)(6) is as high as 122.9%. Our investigation from ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that such case is due to the oxidization of ferricyanide ions. We thereby design a simple approach to solve this problem. After the treatment, the weird initial Coulombic efficiency of the as-prepared Ni2Fe(CN)(6) electrode has changed to 95.9%, and even its electrochemical performance is improved. Briefly, its capacity retention is modified from 81.4 to 87.3% after 85 cycles, and the rate capacities of Ni2Fe(CN)(6)-R are higher than those of Ni2Fe(CN)(6). Our work reveals the mechanism about the weird initial Coulombic efficiency of the as-prepared Ni2Fe(CN)(6) electrode and provides a way to solve this problem.

TI Highly Stable Prussian White K2MnFe(CN)6-Carbon
   Nanotube Cathode for Advanced Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB The present study is focused on a composite material consisting of the Prussian white analogue K2MnFe(CN)6 (K-MnHCF) with modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs), used as a promising high-energy cathode for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). The incorporation of the carbon network to the Prussian white analogue prepared through a facile chelating agent-assisted precipitation method provided control over the particle features, crystallization defects, and lattice moisture compared with the material prepared without it. Thus, at low current rates of 0.1 and 0.5 C in a given voltage window of 2.7-4.4 V vs K/K+, the K-MnHCF-CNT cathode showed a high reversible capacity of 119 mAh g-1, while the material without a CNT backbone delivered a capacity of 108 mAh g-1, exhibiting a capacity loss during cycling. Operando X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated the stability of the K-MnHCF-CNT cathode, showing a reversible two-phase structural transition from monoclinic to tetragonal via an intermediate cubic phase. Moreover, the operando analysis revealed that the incomplete phase conversion from the intermediate cubic to tetragonal phase, related to the Mn2+/Mn3+ transition during charging in the K-MnHCF material without a carbon backbone, can be responsible for its structural instability. Ex-situ findings with the recovered active electrode supported the findings of the operando analysis. Thus, the K-MnHCF-CNT composite appears as a promising candidate for the development of suitable cathodes of PIBs for energy-storage applications.

TI Assembly of NiFe-PBA nanoparticles on nanoflower-like NiFe-PBA@IF as
   enhanced oxygen evolution electrocatalyst at room temperature
SO MOLECULAR CATALYSIS
AB Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) catalysts that overcome low energy barriers to improve the reaction efficiency of the OER are important for the development of future green energy sources. Herein, NiFe-PBA@IF layered nanoflowers were successfully prepared by etching iron foam (IF) using Prussian blue-like (PBA) material as a precursor. Notably, the fractured PBA nanosheets prepared by etching at room temperature had a suitable growth gradient and growth environment with the homogeneous nucleation environment, compared to the conventional method. In this environment, a layered NiFe-PBA structure can be formed on the surface of IF, enabling efficient green synthesis, reducing ecological and economic costs, and providing a clear source of catalytic activity. More importantly, NiFe-PBA@IF has a nanoparticle structure anchored on NiFe-PBA stacked nanoflowers, which can expand the surface roughness and electrochemical active area of the sample, so the OER performance in 1 M KOH is 253 mV@10 mA.cm(-2). The green and direct synthesis of PBA electrocatalysts can provide new ideas for the efficient synthesis of other OER electrocatalysts at room temperature and will further provide an effective template for the industrial application of OER electrocatalysts.

TI Epitaxial Nickel Ferrocyanide Stabilizes Jahn-Teller Distortions of
   Manganese Ferrocyanide for Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Manganese-based Prussian Blue, Na2-delta Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] (MnPB), is a good candidate for sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn-Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. Herein, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel-based Prussian Blue (Na2-delta Ni[Fe(CN)(6)]). The one-pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core-shell materials, which usually needs several steps. The material has an electrochemical capacity of 93 mA h g(-1), of which it retains 96 % after 500 charge-discharge cycles (vs. 37 % for MnPB). Its rate capability is also remarkable: at 4 A g(-1) (ca. 55 C) it can reversibly store 70 mA h g(-1), which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ca. 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1). The epitaxial outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, preventing the Jahn-Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de-sodiation.

TI Porous Nanobimetallic Fe-Mn Cubes with High Valent Mn and Highly
   Efficient Removal of Arsenic(III)
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Iron (Fe) oxides are the most commonly used adsorbent materials for the aqueous removal of Arsenic (As), but they have deficiencies, including low uptake and poor removal of the relatively higher toxicity As(III). Introduction of transition metals into Fe-containing adsorbents, an inexpensive method of altering Fe chemical states, is likewise of interest for removing As(III) from water by means of adsorption. Porous cubic Fe-Mn structures with BET surface area of 450 m(2)g(-1) were here in prepared via chemical etching of Mn-substituted Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs). Cyclic voltammetry showed a "protective" role of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) during the preparation process, so that Mn with high valence state was readily preserved in this binuclear corner-sharing structure. The calculated reaction Gibbs free energy, which was the most negative of the studied adsorbents, indicated that the adsorption was promoted in the presence of high valence Mn. The structures were capable of directly capturing As(III) oxyanions to below the acceptable limits in drinking water standards, and the saturation uptake capacity of 460 mg g(-1) was substantially higher than comparable materials under consideration. The work therefore presents a new benchmark for As-adsorbent materials and demonstrates the promise of the porous Fe-Mn structure for rapid removal of other metal ions from contaminated water for environmental remediation.

TI KI-Assisted Formation of Spindle-like Prussian White Nanoparticles for
   High-Performance Potassium-Ion Battery Cathodes
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Prussian white (PW) is considered as a promising cathode material for potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) due to its low cost and high theoretical capacity. However, the high water content and structural defects and the strict synthesis conditions of PW lead to its unsatisfactory cycling performance and low specific capacity, hindering its practical applications. Herein, a template-engaged reduction method is proposed, using MIL-88B(Fe) as a self-template and KI as the reducing agent to prepare K-rich PW with low defects and water content. Furthermore, the hierarchical porous spindle-like morphology can be inherited from the precursor, furnishing sufficient active sites and reducing the ion diffusion path. Consequently, when applied as a KIB cathode material, spindle-like PW (K1.72Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.96)<middle dot>0.342H(2)O) manifested remarkable potassium storage properties. Notably, a full cell assembled by the spindle-like PW cathode and graphite anode exhibited a large energy density of similar to 216.7 Wh kg(-1), demonstrating its huge potential for energy storage systems.

TI Scalable and universal polyphenol-mediated prussian blue nanocomposite
   membranes: Underliquid dual superlyophobicity and catalytic
   self-cleaning
SO JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE
AB Self-adaptive biomimetic superwetting membranes with distinctive underliquid dual superlyophobic surfaces showcase attractive features for the on-demand separation of multifarious oil/water systems. It yet remains a great challenge for introducing the catalytic function into the design of underliquid dual superlyophobic membranes, to strengthen self-cleaning ability. Herein, a polyphenol-mediated interfacial assembly strategy was proposed to construct multi-functional membranes with underliquid dual superlyophobicity and catalytic self- cleaning, through self-assembly of metal-tannic acid (Fe-TA) networks and then in-situ coordination growth of Prussia blue (PB) nanocrystals at the interface at room temperature. We found that the PB/Fe-TA nanocomposite coating can make hydrophilic and hydrophobic porous membranes, as well as smooth surfaces being underwater superoleophobic and underoil superhydrophobic. The Fe-TA networks were favored for good growth of PB nanocrystals. Using quartz fiber (QF) membrane as the basement substrate, the PB/Fe-TA@QF nanocomposite membrane can separate light/heavy oil/water mixtures and oil-in-water/water-in-oil emulsions under gravity drive, with efficiencies above 99%. The PB/Fe-TA@QF nanocomposite membrane exhibits a superior degrada- tion ability of carmine dye by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, with the removal ratio as high as 99.8% within 30 min and meanwhile has an excellent antifouling and catalytic self-cleaning performance after cycling emulsion separation. Excellent acid, alkali and salt toleration, as well as good repeatability, provide the potential for application in wastewater treatment. This research puts forward a green, versatile and scalable pathway to fabricate multifunctional superwetting membranes for various applications in the fields including the environ- ment, energy and beyond.

Considering practical application demands and cost-effectiveness, non-aqueous organic zinc-ion batteries have shown significant development potential by avoiding interference from active hydrogen and offering a stable wide voltage window. Herein, a sodium-rich monoclinic structured manganese hexacyanoferrate (m-MnHCF) was synthesized via a simple coprecipitation method, achieving a stable high-voltage zinc-ion battery energy storage system in a diluted 0.2 M Zn(CF3SO3)(2) electrolyte in acetonitrile, a non-protonic polar solvent. The battery exhibited a discharge specific capacity of 77 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 1 A g(-1) after 620 cycles. Furthermore, by circumventing interference from active hydrogen, a cost-advantaged zinc powder anode (Zn-P) was successfully introduced into the energy storage system. Assembled Zn-P||m-MnHCF cells exhibited stable cycling for 100 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) with close to 100 % coulombic efficiency, showcasing limitless possibilities for the future, as demonstrated by illuminated LED arrays.

TI CoFeNi based trifunctional electrocatalysts featuring
   in-situ formed heterostructure
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB All-in-one transition metal-based electrocatalysts with high activities towards different reactions in aqueous electrolytes are of critical importance as they can dramatically bring down the cost of relevant energy devices. Herein a facile and low-cost synthesis of CoFeNi nanoparticles encapsulated by an N-doped carbon layer has been developed by pyrolyzing Prussian blue (PB) precursors. The obtained catalyst features tri-catalytic activity to-wards OER, ORR, and HER reactions in alkaline and acidic condition, and show great potential as a catalyst for water splitting and anode material for Zinc-Air batteries. Moreover, compared with the single phase, the sample with the heterostructure composed of both fcc and bcc phases exhibited dramatic enhancement in multi-catalytic activity. The heterostructure originates from an in-situ phase separation induced by composition variation. This demonstrates the effectiveness of heterostructure engineering introduced by in-situ phase separation in boosting the multi-catalytic activity.

TI Spherical Murray-Type Assembly of Co-N-C Nanoparticles as a
   High-Performance Trifunctional Electrocatalyst
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Future renewable energy conversion requires advanced electrocatalysis technologies for hydrogen production, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries. Highly efficient trifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts are a critical precious metal replacement for the economically viable electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction and water splitting, both of which are a triphase electrode process. Electrocatalysts with a refined porous structure and active composition beneficial for three-phase reactions are broadly pursued. Herein, a highly promising trifunctional spherical Murray assembly of Co-N-C nanoparticles was derived from low-cost Prussian blue analogues for the oxygen reduction reaction and water splitting. The Murray-type architecture with a tunable porous hierarchy for efficient mass transfer and the combination of a Co-N-C active composition are key for the improved electrocatalytic performance. Acid-leaching produced an optimized Murray-type durable and methanol-tolerant Co-N-C electrocatalyst that achieved an onset potential of 0.94 V [vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] and a half wave potential of 0.84 V (vs RHE) as well as a large diffusion-limited current density of 5.7 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen reduction reaction, which is comparable to Pt/C. In addition, it displayed low onset overpotentials of similar to 150 and similar to 350 mV corresponding to the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, highlighting its great potential to be used in overall water splitting with a total splitting voltage of 1.73 V. This work highlights the importance of Murray-type electrocatalysts for multiphase energy-related reactions.

TI Hierarchical Multi-Core-Shell CoNi@Graphite Carbon@Carbon Nanoboxes for
   Highly Efficient Broadband Microwave Absorption
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB The rational construction of a core-shell structure has been widely used in the design of absorbing materials for improved impedance and attenuation matching. However, for traditional absorbing core-shell materials, it is crucial to further regulate the morphology and composition of the core after encapsulation, to realize further improvement in absorbing performance. In this work, heterogeneous multi-core-shell CoNi@graphite carbon@carbon (hereinafter referred to as CGC) nanocomposites have been fabricated via the polymerization of dopamine on the surface of cobalt-nickel Prussian blue analogues and subsequent carbonization. Because of the effect of metal catalytic graphitization, the CoNi alloy formed during high-temperature carbonization promotes the transitional process from amorphous carbon to graphite, thus forming a multi-core-shell structure with the CoNi alloy coated with graphite carbon as the core and amorphous carbon as the shell. Notably, the as-prepared CGC nanocomposites with an optimized paraffin loading ratio exhibit superior electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing capacity, reaching a minimum reflection loss value of -56.78 dB at 14.76 GHz with a thickness of 2.0 mm, much better than that of most magnetic carbon-based absorbing materials as reported previously. Furthermore, the effective bandwidth goes across 5.51 dB (12.34-17.85 GHz), therefore enriching the absorbing application in the Ku band. As a result, the superior impedance and attenuation matching derived from the heterogeneous multi-core-shell structure and multiple electromagnetic loss components make CGC a promising EMW absorbing material.

TI Isolation of octahedral to tetrahedral cobalt-azido molecular assemblies
   based on cationic influence
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB Two novel cobalt-azido compounds [Me4N](2)[NaCo(EE-N-3)(6)] 1 and [Ph4P](2)[Co(N-3)(4)] 2; where Me4N = tetramethyl ammonium ion, EE = end-to-end, Ph4P = tetraphenyl phosphonium ion, have been synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Two compounds were synthesized by varying the size of the cations. The size of the cations effects remarkably producing different cobaltazido compounds. Depending on the cation size the framework dimensionality changes from 3D to mononuclear complex. The smaller cation leads to a 3D framework which is an interesting Prussian Blue analogue type structure but the bigger cation produces a discrete mononuclear unit. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Cu-substituted Prussian white with low crystal defects as high-energy
   cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Prussian white (PW) has emerged as a promising cathode material for high-energy sodium-ion batteries owing to its high working voltage, high specific capacity, and cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, its practical utilization is impeded by challenges related to insufficient cycling stability, primarily stemming from poor structural stability due to large defects in the lattice structures and irreversible phase transitions. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to overcome these challenges by substituting the manganese sites of PW with 10 mol% copper. During the synthesis process, substitution with Cu enabled the formation of fewer defects and interstitial water. Cu has no electrochemical redox reactions during the charge-discharge process; so, it showed an initial lower capacity (120 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C). However, Cu substitution resulted in a significant improvement in the long-term cycling stability(67.6% at 10C after 500 cycles) by relieving structural stress due to the reversible rhombohedral-to-cubic phase transition. Moreover, the pouch cell (PW-Cu10/hard carbon) exhibits a discharge capacity of 85.4 mAh g(-1) and stable cycling retention of 80% at 1.0C after 250 cycles. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for designing practical Prussian white cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.

   properties to volatile organic compounds
SO OPTIK
AB This paper demonstrates the potential of a new ternary clad modified polypyrrole (PPy), prussian blue (PB) and SnO2, PPy-PB-SnO2 sensor for fiber optic gas sensing applications. The as-prepared SnO2 and PPy-PB-SnO2 composite is characterized structurally, morphologically and thermally by XRD, FESEM, HRTEM and TGA techniques. Further, the ternary PPy-PB-SnO2 composite is used as an effective clad modified fiber optic gas sensing material to examine a series of volatile gases, such as ethanol, ammonia, acetone and methanol at room temperature and its sensing characteristics is compared with pure SnO2 sensor. From the detailed experiments, it is observed that the ternary composite exhibits excellent spectral response to all the volatile gases and is highly selective to ammonia gas which outstripped the gas sensing properties of SnO2. Thus, the as-prepared ternary PPy-PB-SnO2 composite sensor implies its potential application in fiber optic gas sensors.

TI High efficiency oxygen evolution reaction enabled by 3D network composed
   of nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon-coated metal/metal oxide
   heterojunctions
SO ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
AB The ability to develop low-cost highly efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to the overall water splitting device that represents a viable and promising source of alternative energy. Herein, we crafted three-dimensional (3D) network comprising nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon-coated heterojunctions (denoted NC-Ni0.36Fe0.64/MnOx) via one-step calcination of hybrid precursors containing ternary Prussian blue analogues and polymers. The NC-Ni0.36Fe0.64/MnOx nanocomposites were then exploited as catalysts for OER, displaying exceptional performance with a small overpotential of 300 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 43 mV/dec and an outstanding stability without deactivation over a 10-h OER. Notably, compared to commercial RuO2 catalysts, NCeNi0.36Fe0.64/MnOx catalysts demonstrated much lower overpotential and Tafel slope. The excellent OER performance can be attributed to the presence of high-valence oxidized metal species (Ni2+, Fe2+ and Mn2+) at the hetero-structured interface as well as pyridinic N-doped carbon species on highly conductive graphitic carbon network, thus greatly facilitating the electron-withdrawing from OH- and thus charge transfer during OER. This simple yet effective strategy may open new possibilities for creating a wide range of low-cost, high-efficiency, non-precious transition metal OER catalysts for the overall water splitting.

TI "Room Temperature Molten Salt"-Based Polymer Electrolyte Enabling a
   High-Rate and High-Thermal Stability Hybrid Li/Na-Ion Battery
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB "Water-in-salt" electrolytes have enlarged the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes to 3.0 V. However, the practical application of this electrolyte faces the challenge of high cost. Recently, we have proposed a low-cost inorganic room temperature molten salt (RTMS) electrolyte with a widened electrochemical window of 3.1 V. Herein, the RTMS electrolyte has been integrated with a hydrophilic polymer by ultrafast polymerization through electron beam irradiation to further enlarge the anode limit, increase the ionic conductivity, and improve the thermal stability. The double-redox-active Prussian blue analogues of the cobalt hexacyanoferrate cathode (NaCoHCF) in the RTMS-based polymer electrolyte prepared by electron beam (EB) irradiation (e-RPE) show electrochemical performance with a high capacity of 137 mAh.g(-1) at 1C and 100 mAh.g(-1) at 5C. More significantly, at a high number temperature of 60 degrees C, the NaCoHCF electrode in e-RPE exhibits a high capacity of 120 mAh.g(-1) at 5C and a high capacity retention of 92% over 100 cycles at 1C. Compared to RTMS, the RTMS-based polymer electrolyte not only expands the hydrogen evolution limit but also shows high thermal stability, which is favorable for the electrochemical performance of NaCoHCF at high temperature. Furthermore, the battery with e-RPE is intrinsically safe and can be widely used in large-scale energy storage and wearable device applications.

TI PBA derived FeCoP nanoparticles decorated on NCNFs as efficient
   electrocatalyst for water splitting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Transition metal phosphides have been known as promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) due to their high catalytic activity. In this work, the FeCoP nanoparticles decorated on N-doped electrospun carbon nanofibers (FeCoP@NCNFs) was successfully synthesized through depositing Fe, Co-based Prussian blue analogue Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot 10H(2)O (FeCo-PBA) onto the electrospun PVP/PAN nanofibers via layer-by-layer approach, followed by carbonization and phosphorization treatments. Benefiting from the high electrical conductivity, abundant catalytic active sites and the synergistic effect between FeCoP nanoparticles and N-doped carbon nanofibers network, the obtained FeCoP@NCNFs displays good bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. In 1 M KOH, the FeCoP@NCNFs achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 290, 226 mV for OER and HER, respectively. Moreover, it demands overpotential of 196 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4. The FeCoP@NCNFs is used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting, it requires a low voltage of 1.65 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains outstanding stability over 10 h. Herein, a strategy for preparing bifunctional electrocatalysts of compositing transition metal phosphides with carbon nanofibers is proposed, and the application of metal-organic framework in electrocatalytic field is further extended.

TI Engineering the Electrochemical Temperature Coefficient for Efficient
   Low-Grade Heat Harvesting
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Low-grade heat to electricity conversion has shown a large potential for sustainable energy supply. Recently, the low-grade heat harvesting in the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) is a promising candidate with high energy conversion efficiency. In this system, the electrochemical temperature coefficient (alpha) plays a dominant role in efficient heat harvesting. However, the internal factors that affect are still not clear and significant improvements are needed. Here, alpha of various Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) is investigated and their lattice change during cation intercalation is monitored using the ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. For the first time, it is found that alpha is highly related to the lattice parameter change. Large lattice shrinkage exhibits a large negative alpha, while lattice expansion is corresponding to a positive alpha. These are mainly attributed to the different phonon vibration entropy changes upon cation intercalation in various PBAs. Especially, purple cobalt hexacynoferrate delivers the largest alpha of -0.89 mV K-1 and enables highly efficient heat conversion efficiency up to 2.65% (21% of relative efficiency). The results of this study provide a fundamental understanding of temperature coefficient in electrochemical reactions and pave the way for designing high-performance material for low-grade heat harvesting.

These compounds adopt the primitive cubic pcu topology and show strict cation order. Optical absorption measurements show these compounds have band gaps within the visible and near IR region, suggesting that they may be useful for applications where light harvesting is key, such as photocatalysis. We also show that Cr[Bi(SCN)(6)] can reversibly uptake water into its framework structure pointing towards the possibility of using these frameworks for host/guest chemistry.

TI Crafting MoC2-doped bimetallic alloy nanoparticles
   encapsulated within N-doped graphene as roust bifunctional
   electrocatalysts for overall water splitting
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Despite recent vigorous progress in synthesis of monofunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it remains challenging to develop bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient overall water splitting. Herein, we report the crafting of MoC2-doped NiFe alloy nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated within a-few-layer-thick N-doped graphene (denoted NG-NiFe@MoC2) via one-step calcination of hybrid precursors containing polymer-encapsulating binary Prussian blue analogues NPs and Mo6+ cations. The resulting NG-NiFe@MoC2 nanohybrids were exploited as electrocatalysts and exhibited excellent performance on either HER or OER separately as a direct consequence of the synergistic effects of unique compositions (i.e., MoC2 dopants and NiFe alloy NPs; both exerted profound influence on HER and OER) and advantageous architecture (i.e., a-few-layer-thick N-doped graphene encapsulating shell). Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyte capitalizing on NG-NiFe@ MoC2 nanohybrids as bifunctional electrocatalysts achieved overall water-splitting (i.e., concurrent HER and OER) current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.53 V over a period of 10-h operation, outperforming the precious Pt/C//RuO2 counterpart.

TI CoOx/CeO2@C nanopetals derived Cobalt-Cerium Prussian blue with enhanced
   Dual-Enzyme mimetic activity for detection of ascorbic acid in rat brain
   during calm/ischemic processes
SO TALANTA
AB In this study, we demonstrate that a highly efficient colorimetric sensor prepared from carbon-shielded Co-Ce Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanopetals (CoOx/ CeO2@C) by green chemical deposition method and thermal annealing processes for detection of ascorbic acid (AA) in cerebral microdialysis fluids. The synthesized CoOx/CeO2@C showed high dual-mimetic activity, i.e., peroxidase- and catalase-like activity, and great catalytic stability. The combination of carbon film and Co-Ce PBA nanopetals (1) greatly enhances the interfacial electron transfer rate of the nanopetals due to excellent electrical conductivity of carbon, and (2) protects nanopetals from acidic chemical environments during the catalytic process, which greatly reduces loss of the catalytic activity of the cobalt-cerium (hydroxide) oxides. Based on the peroxidase-like property of CoOx/CeO2@C nanopetals, this sensor has a good linear range from 0.1 to 150 mu M with a low detection limit of 0.04 mu M, i.e., improved sensitivity for AA colorimetric measurement. The developed colorimetric strategy with a green synthetic pathway, catalytic stability and wide linear range confirms the monitoring of AA in brain systems during calm/ischemic processes.

TI An unusual reaction in nitromethane solution: use of the Cp*Rh moiety to
   form Prussian blue analogues
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB The direct decomposition of nitromethane into nitrile compounds is a significant challenge due to the occurrence of severe side-reactions. In this study, we present a novel and gentle methodology for converting primary nitromethane into nitriles using [Cp*RhCl2]2. This reaction stands out for its simplicity and convenience under mild conditions. Moreover, the resulting nitrile serves as a direct precursor for the construction of organometallic complexes 1-3, through treating with different equivalents of AgOTf. Additionally, we conducted a systematic investigation into the mechanism of this reaction, revealing that the presence of AgOTf plays a crucial role in the formation of diverse organometallic cages. To provide comprehensive characterization, we employed various techniques including IR spectroscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, HRESI-MS measurements, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD).

TI Potassium Nickel Iron Hexacyanoferrate as Ultra-Long-Life Cathode
   Material for Potassium-Ion Batteries with High Energy Density
SO ACS NANO
AB The abundant reserve and low price of potassium resources promote K-ion batteries (KIBs) becoming a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries, while the large ionic radius of K-ions creates a formidable challenge for developing suitable electrodes. Here Ni-substituted Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are investigated comprehensively as cathodes for KIBs. The synthesized K1.90Ni0.5Fe0.5[Fe(CN)(6)](0.89)center dot 0.42H(2)O (KNFHCF-1/2) takes advantage of the merits of high capacity from electrochemically active Fe-ions, outstanding electrochemical kinetics induced by decreased band gap and K-ion diffusion activation energy, and admirable structure stability from inert Ni-ions. Therefore, a high first capacity of 81.6 mAh.g(-1) at 10 mA.g(-1), an excellent rate property (53.4 mAh.g(-1) at 500 mA.g(-1)), and a long-term lifespan over 1000 cycles with the lowest fading rate of 0.0177% per cycle at 100 mA.g(-1) can be achieved for KNFHCF-1/2. The K-ion intercalation/deintercalation proceeds through a facile solid solution mechanism, allowing 1.5-electron transfer based on low- and high-spins Fe-II/F-III couples, which is verified by ex situ XRD, XPS, and DFT calculations. The K-ion full battery is also demonstrated using a graphite anode with a high energy density of 282.7 Wh.kg(-1). This work may promote more studies on PRA electrodes and accelerate the development of KIBs.

TI Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 derived
   Fe/Fe5C2@N-doped carbon as a highly effective
   oxygen reduction reaction catalyst for zinc-air battery
SO APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
AB We fabricated a highly effective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst consisting of Fe/Fe5C2 species wrapped in N-doped carbon (Fe/Fe5C2@N-C), derived from annealing decomposition of a zinciferous Prussian blue analogue Zn-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), which can be prepared through a facile precipitation reaction. The rationally designed carbon layer-encapsulated structure with iron/iron carbide encased inside the N-doped graphitic carbon shells is favorable for ORR, wherein the iron species not only facilitate the graphitization process but also improve the ORR activity together with outside N-doped graphic carbon. The resultant catalyst demonstrates a positive half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) and a nearly four-electron pathway in 0.1 M KOH solution, comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C. With superior stability to that of Pt/C, Fe/Fe5C2@N-C suffers almost no performance attenuation after 5000 potential cycles. The zinc-air battery using Fe/Fe5C2@N-C catalyst exhibits high power density and capacity, holding great promise for the practical application of metal-air batteries.

TI The Inducement and "Rejuvenation" of Li Dendrites by Space Confinement
   and Positive Fe/Co-Sites
SO SMALL
AB The high reactivity of Li metal and the inhomogeneous Li deposition leads to the formation of Li dendrites and "dead" Li, which impedes the performance of Li metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density. The regulating and guiding the Li dendrite nucleation is a desirable tactic to realize concentrated distribution of Li dendrites instead of completely inhibiting dendrite formation. Here, a Fe-Co-based Prussian blue analog with hollow and open framework (H-PBA) is employed to modify the commercial polypropylene separator (PP@H-PBA). This functional PP@H-PBA can guide the lithium dendrite growth to form uniform lithium deposition and activate the inactive Li. In details, the H-PBA with macroporous structure and open framework can induce the growth of lithium dendrites via space confinement, while the positive Fe/Co-sites lowered by polar cyanide (-CN) of PBA can reactivate the inactive Li. Thus, the Li|PP@H-PBA|Li symmetric cells exhibit long-term stability at 1 mA cm(-2) for 1 mAh cm(-2) over 500 h. And the Li-S batteries with PP@H-PBA deliver favorable cycling performance at 500 mA g(-1) for 200 cycles.

TI Co-insertion chemistry boosting site activity and structural stability
   of nickel hexacyanoferrate for superior aqueous ammonium ion storage
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AAIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage because of their low cost, exceptional safety, and rapid ion diffusion. However, the large ionic radius of NH4+ (1.43 & Aring;) leads to structural damage and limited transport dynamics of cathode materials. In this study, a K+ pre-intercalated Prussian blue analogue (KNiHCF) cathode is designed, which co-inserts NH4+/K+ during cycling process. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that NH4+/K+ co-insertion, as compared with pure NH4+ insertion, enhances the binding interaction of guest ions to the host materials, improves structural stability and promotes ion diffusion. Moreover, dual-ion co-insertion can effectively improve the electrochemical kinetics and site activity of [Fe(CN)6]3-/[Fe(CN)6]4-, revealing the two-phase transition mechanism during cycling. Therefore, KNiHCF exhibits a superior ammonium ion storage performance (63.9 mA h g- 1 at 60 mA g- 1 ). KNiHCF cathodes, as compared with other similar cathodes, exhibit excellent cycling stability (77.3 % after 3000 cycles at 3000 mA g- 1 ). Additionally, assembled KNiHCF//activated carbon (AC) hybrid capacitors exhibit an extraordinary capacity retention of 94.9 % after 4000 cycles at 1000 mA g- 1 . Thus, this study provides new insights into the storage mechanisms of AAIBs.

TI A novel MnCoOx@TiO2 double-wall nanocages derived
   from Prussian blue analogue for NH3-SCR of NOx
SO FUEL
AB By annealing the self-assembled Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)<middle dot>nH(2)O@Ti(OH)(4), MnCoOx@TiO2 double-walled nanocage catalysts were obtained. Excellent low-temperature NH3-SCR performance (above 90 % NO conversion efficiency at 200-325 degrees C), acceptable stability, and exceptional SO2 resistance were demonstrated. According to a series of characterizations, the MnCoOx@TiO2 catalysts were found to have an enlarged specific surface area, improved surface acidity and redox ability, enhanced dispersion of active components, and abundantly formed adsorbed oxygen (O-ads) species, which consequently exhibited the improved deNO(x) performance. Meanwhile, the coating of the TiO2 shell reduced the basic sites to adsorb SO2, hence leaving a certain proportion of active metal oxides preserved. Apparently, the MnCoOx@TiO2 catalysts were observed to have an enhanced SO2-resistant ability.

AB The achievement of controlling thermal expansion is important for open-framework structures. The present work proposes a feasible way to adjust the coefficient of thermal expansion continuously from negative to positive via inserting guest Na+ ions or H2O molecules into a GaFe(CN)(6) framework. The guest ions or molecules have an intense dampening effect on the transverse vibrations of CN atoms in the -Ga-N  C- Fe- linkage, especially for the N atoms. This study demonstrates that electrochemical or redox intercalation of guest ions will be an effective way to tune thermal expansion in those negative thermal expansion open framework materials induced by low-frequency phonons.

TI Defect modulation and in-situ exsolution in
   Y2Ru2O7@NiFeP/Ru heterostructure for
   enhanced oxygen evolution reaction
SO RARE METALS
AB Pyrochlore oxide (Y2Ru2O7) has been identified as a promising catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in advanced green energy strategies. However, its electrochemical inertness necessitates the exploration of an effective strategy to facilitate electronic modulation. This study proposes a surface modification approach involving the integration of defective NiFe (D-NiFe) nanoparticles onto a Y2Ru2O7 (YRO) support (YRO@D-NiFeP/Ru) using a Prussian blue analog (PBA). Numerous cyanide (CN) vacancies are generated through the oxidation treatment of the NiFe PBA grown on the YRO support, yielding a defective PBA precursor (YRO@D-PBA). Subsequent annealing facilitates the transformation to the D-NiFe nanoparticles on the YRO support (YRO@D-NiFeP/Ru), which augments the exposure of Ni3+ active sites beneficial for the OER. Moreover, the reduction of Ru cations from YRO results in the exsolution of Ru nanoparticles, which promotes synergistic charge transfer from the nanoparticles to the interior of Y2Ru2O7. Consequently, YRO@D-NiFeP/Ru exhibits a remarkable voltage of 1.49 V at 10 mA<middle dot>cm(-2) and the lowest Tafel slope of 42.4 mV<middle dot>dec(-1). In addition, a Zn-air battery constructed with YRO@D-NiFeP/Ru exhibits an outstanding power density of 136.2 mW<middle dot>cm(-2) and high charge-discharge stability, confirming the applicability of YRO@D-NiFeP/Ru in metal-air batteries.

TI Different Agglomeration Processes Induced by the Varied Interaction of
   Fe-Fe Analogues with Differently Charged Surfactants
SO LANGMUIR
AB ABSTRACT: The catalytic activity of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) is mainly tuned via the control of material sizes and morphologies. However, the shapes and sizes of many PBAs are difficult to control. In this work, a facile approach is demonstrated using differently charged surfactants to tune the catalytic activity of PBAs. Fe???Fe PBAs prepared with non-ionic P123, cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate are chosen to study the effect of surfactant charges on the catalytic activity. The transesterification of propylene carbonate to dimethyl carbonate by methanol is selected as a model reaction. Owing to the different agglomeration processes of PB particles after modified with differently charged surfactants, significantly varied shapes and sizes were observed. Accordingly, the catalytic activity is greatly varied by adding surfactants. The different catalytic activities may arise from the different behaviors of agglomeration of PB particles after surfactant modification as well as the material size and shape changes. Besides, apparent activation energies for PBs adding different surfactants were derived. Finally, the agglomeration mechanism of PB particles in the presence of differently charged surfactants was proposed.

TI Long cycle life aqueous rechargeable battery Zn/Vanadium
   hexacyanoferrate with H<SUP>+</SUP>/Zn<SUP>2+</SUP> coinsertion for high
   capacity
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Aqueous rechargeable ion batteries have drawn considerable interest owing to their high safety, low cost, and outstanding ionic conductivity. Herein, the vanadium hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue analogs (VO-PBAs) nanoparticles are prepared by a facile co-precipitation way to fully make use of the merits of VO2+/VO2+ and Fe(CN)(6)](4-)/[Fe(CN)(6)](3-) redox actives. Specifically, the as-fabricated Zn/VO-PBAs aqueous rechargeable battery achieves a high capacity of 209.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) due to the introduction of V = O bonds and obtains an excellent rate performance (129.0 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)) due to the high proportion of pseudocapacitive contribution. Moreover, the conversion of the VO-PBAs nanoparticles to nanosheets during the initial activation process increases the electrochemical reaction active sites and promotes the fast electrolyte ions transport of the electrode materials. Meanwhile, the VO-PBAs cathode presents excellent cycle stability, which can retain 95.5% capacity after 2000 cycles at 1 A g(-1). Besides, the electrochemical energy storage mechanism is involved with the co-insertion/extraction of the Zn2+/H+, and the VO-PBAs keeps the cubic phase during the charge/discharge process revealed by the in situ XRD. The synergistic effect of the Zn2+/H+ ions makes the excellent electrochemical performance of the Zn/VO-PBAs system and thus promotes the application of aqueous rechargeable ion batteries.

AB Due to excellent activity, electronic conductivity, and stability, transition metal selenide shows incredible potential for energy storage and conversion. In this work, trimetallic CoNiSe2/Fe-CoNiSe2 yolk-shell nanoboxes (YSBs) are developed via ZIF-67/NiCoFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursors as efficient electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors (SCs). Structural engineering of the PBA framework with Co-Fe oxide increases the topological complexity of the nanostructure. The energy storage activity is effectively improved because of the open structure and larger surface area. The presence of trimetallic selenides in CoNiSe2/FeNiCoSe2 YSBs improves the electronic structures and thus electrochemical performances and enhanced conductivity of the nanostructure compared with oxide counterparts. As a result, it enables attractive electrochemical performance when used as an electrode for battery-type supercapacitors. CoNiSe2/Fe-CoNiSe2 yolkshell nanoboxes show high specific capacity of 1091.2 C/g at 1.0 A/g, good acceleration performance (55% at 20 A/g), and excellent cycle stability (85% recovery after 5000 charge/discharge cycles). Furthermore, the NiCoSe2/Fe-NiCoSe2 YSBs//AC hybrid SC demonstrates an energy density above 76.5 Wh/Kg at a power density of 2378.7 W/Kg. These results suggest that the current strategy may provide a way for designing efficient electrode materials for energy storage by preparing trimetallic chalcogenides with yolk-shell structures.

TI Water desalination with nickel hexacyanoferrate electrodes in capacitive
   deionization: Experiment, model and comparison with carbon
SO DESALINATION
AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a water desalination technology in which ions are removed from water by creating a potential difference between two capacitive electrodes. Porous carbon has been extensively used as an electrode material in CDI. However, recent developments in the field of intercalation materials have led to their application in CDI due to their large ion storage capacity. One such intercalation material, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF), was used in this study as the electrode material. A symmetrical cell was assembled with two identical NiHCF electrodes separated by an anion-exchange membrane. The effect of operational parameters such as current density, feed concentration and flow rate on the desalination characteristics of the cell was investigated. The highest salt adsorption capacity of approximate to 35 mg/g was measured at a current density of 2.5 A/m(2) in a 20 mM NaCl feed solution. Furthermore, a Nernst-Planck transport model was successfully used to predict the change in the outlet concentration and cell voltage of the symmetric CDI cell. Finally, performance of the symmetric NiHCF CDI cell was compared with an MCDI cell with porous carbon electrodes. The NiHCF cell, on average, consumed 2.5 times less energy than the carbon-based MCDI cell to achieve similar levels of salt removal from saline water in CDI.

TI Prussian blue analogues-derived 2D NiCo@C bimetals grown on g-C3N4 as
   photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB The development of highly active and stable cocatalysts using earth -abundant transition metals to replace noble metals is important for the application of photocatalytic hydrogen production technology. In this study, twodimensional (2D) carbon-encapsulated NiCo bimetallic nanosheets (NiCo@C) was designed for the first time as a new co-catalyst to synergistically combine with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and promote its hydrogen evolution. The NiCo@C cocatalysts were using an innovative molten salt method by using nickel hexacyanocobaltate Ni3[Co(CN)6]2 (Ni -Co PBA) nanocubes as precursor. The Ni -Co PBA nanocubes undergo dissolution growth and salt templating processes to form bimetallic 2D nanosheets during charring in molten salt media, and combine with 2D g-C3N4 to form NiCo@C/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The optimized NiCo@C/g-C3N4 photocatalyst significantly improved the H2 evolution activity, and the H2 evolution rate reached 3791.07 mu mol center dot g- 1 center dot h-1, which was 5 times higher than that of the particle CoNi/g-C3N4 (636.89 mu mol center dot g- 1 center dot h-1). The H2 evolution activity was also comparable to that of the photocatalytic activity of 1.0% Pt/g-C3N4 system, indicating that the earth -abundant NiCo@C can replace noble metal as a cocatalyst to significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance of 2D photocatalysts. The conversion of three-dimensional Ni -Co PBA into carbon-coated 2D metal nanosheets by molten salt-assisted pyrolysis provides a feasible approach to explore the synthesis and design of efficient and robust non-precious metal catalysts.

TI The Compensation Effect Mechanism of Fe-Ni Mixed Prussian Blue Analogues
   in Aqueous Rechargeable Aluminum-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMSUSCHEM
AB An aluminum-ion battery was assembled with potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate (KNHCF) as a cathode and Al foil as an anode in aqueous electrolyte for the first time, based on Al3+ intercalation and deintercalation. A combination of ex situ XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), and differential capacity analysis was used to unveil the crystal structure changes and the insertion/extraction mechanism of Al3+. Al3+ could reversibly insert/extract into/from KNHCF nanoparticles through a single-phase reaction with reduction/oxidation of Fe and Ni. Over long-term cycling, it was Fe rather than Ni that contributed to more capacity owing to the dissolution of Ni from the KNHCF structure, which could be expressed as a compensation effect of mixed redox centers in KNHCF. KNHCF delivered an initial discharge capacity of 46.5 mAh g(-1). The capacity decay could be attributed to the unstable interface between Al foil and the aqueous electrolyte owing to the catalytic activity of the Ni transferring from Ni dissolution of KNHCF to the Al foil anode, rather than KNHCF structure collapse; KNHCF maintained its 3 D framework structure for 500 cycles. This work is expected to inspire more exhaustive investigations of the mechanisms that occur in aluminum-ion batteries.

TI Trace Ammonia Removal from Air by Selective Adsorbents Reusable with
   Water
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Ammonia adsorbents effective even in trace concentrations are key to the countermeasure for air pollution of particulate matter caused by ammonia emission from agriculture sectors. We revealed that Prussian blue (PB) and its adsorptic- analogues (PBAs), one of the porous coordination polymers, have higher ammonia adsorption capacity in 10 ppmv of ammonia (parts per million in volume, 10 ppmv = 0.0001 volume percent), >= 8 times that of conventional adsorbents. Moreover, these compounds can be recycled only through water flushing. The adsorption capacity of PBA was restricted to 10 cycles of adsorption/desorption, and the air sample for the experiment was collected from the composting equipment present in a swine farm. Despite the presence of saturated water vapor in the exhaust gas, the adsorbents showed excellent selectivity in the removal of ammonia from the sample.

TI Crystal structure refinement of the electron-transfer-active potassium
   manganese hexacyanoferrates and isomorphous potassium manganese
   hexacyanocobaltates
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB We report on the crystal structure refinements in the novel electron-transfer-active Prussian Blue analogs (PBA) KMn4II[(Co1-xFexIII)-Fe-III(CN)(6)](3)center dot nH(2)O (n similar or equal to 12). The series of novel PBA with the end members of KMn4[Co(CN)(6)](3)center dot 11.8 H2O and KMn4[Fe(CN)(6)](3)center dot 10.5 H2O have been synthesized for the first time, all showing a number of extra-reflections incompatible with ordinary face-centered cell of the Fm-3m symmetry group. We have analyzed the Rietveld patterns for x = 0, 0.53,1 and found that the extrareflections could be well fitted using several primitive (P) cell symmetries. The best fitting quality was obtained using the noncentrosymmetric space group (S.G.) P (4) over bar 3m (Z=1) with the origin of coordinate system shifted into a zeolitic site. In this structure model, the Co-CN-Mn entities are bent owing to the charge introduced by the K+ insertion that induces also the electron transfer between Mn and Fe. Using Mossbauer spectroscopy the electron transfer activity is identified with the appearance of unsplit resonance at the isomer shift of typically -0.15 mm/s evidencing the low-spin state for Fe3+ and Fe2+ species. In the same P (4) over bar 3m phases doped with Fe-57(2+) into the Mn site, a sequence of discrete values of quadrupole splitting (0 mm/s, 0.9 mm/s, 1.8 mm/s) is observed and attributed to different conformations of the polyhedra, in which the ground states are orbital triplet, doublet and singlet, respectively.

TI Entropy-Regulated Cathode with Low Strain and Constraint Phase-Change
   Toward Ultralong-Life Aqueous Al-Ion Batteries
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB During multivalent ions insertion processes, intense electrostatic interaction between charge carriers and host makes the high-performance reversible Al3+ storage remains an elusive target. On account of the strong electrostatic repulsion and poor robustness, Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) suffer severely from the inevitable and large strain and phase change during reversible Al3+ insertion. Herein, we demonstrate an entropy-driven strategy to realize ultralong life aqueous Al-ion batteries (AIBs) based on medium entropy PBAs (ME-PBAs) host. By multiple redox active centers introduction, the intrinsic poor conductivity can be enhanced simultaneously, resulting in outstanding capabilities of electrochemical Al3+ storage. Meanwhile, the co-occupation at metal sites in PBA frameworks can also increase the M-N bond intensity, which is beneficial for constraining the phase change during consecutive Al3+ reversible insertion, to realize an extended lifespan over 10,000 cycles. Based on the calculation at different operation states, the fluctuation of ME-PBA lattice parameters is only 1.2 %. Assembled with MoO3 anodes, the full cells can also deliver outstanding electrochemical properties. The findings highlight that, the entropy regulation strategy could uncover the isochronous constraint on both strain and phase transition for long-term reversible Al3+ storage, providing a promising design for advanced electrode materials for aqueous multivalent ions batteries.
   The successful implementation of an entropy-regulation approach is proposed by using PBAs as cathode for aqueous AIBs, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance. As-designed medium-entropy cathode could deliver a high capacity for reversible Al3+ storage, which is attributed to the activation of numerous redox centres and low strain, further enabling ultra-high rates of ion storage and an exceptionally long lifespan. image

TI Rational design and in-situ formation of nickel-cobalt nitride
   multi-core/hollow N-doped carbon shell anode for Li-ion batteries
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The construction of a carbon-encapsulated multi-core nanostructure based on transition metal nitride is a preferred approach to efficiently mitigate volume expansion with improved sustainability and to enhance conductivity with more active sites for Li-ion cell reaction. Herein, we report the in-situ formation of carbon-coated nickel-cobalt nitride multi-core nanoparticles encapsulated by hollow N-doped carbon shell via monodispersed Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) Prussian blue analogue/polydopamine precursors using by simultaneous nitridation and calcination process. The (Ni/Co)(3)N multi-core nanoparticles (Ni:Co = 3:2) were highly dispersed in conductive and hollow N-doped carbon shell, thereby (i) mitigating mechanical stress by volume change during the conversion reaction of nitrides, (ii) stabilizing the electrochemical reaction surface with a thin solid electrolyte interphase, and (iii) maintaining the original structure and hierarchical morphologies even after long cycles. The (Ni/Co)(3)N multi-core@hollow N-doped carbon shell demonstrated better electrochemical performance than the (Ni/Co)(3) N@carbon shell without the outer hollow N-doped carbon shell for the Li-ion battery anode, which has an excellent reversible capacity of similar to 440 mAh g(-1)- and a stable cycle life of 130 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). The rational synthetic strategy of the unique hybrid nanoarchitecture via in-situ formation of polymer-coated metal-organic frameworks is key in improving the Li-ion storage capacity and cycle stability.

TI Electrochemical interfacing of Prussian blue nanocrystals with an ITO
   electrode modified with a thin film containing a Ru complex
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Prussian blue (PB) is a well-known porous metal-organic framework (MOF) material, whose redox chemistry on indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrodes has been studied extensively. However, the molecular interfacing of PB nanocrystals has not yet been explored in such detail. In this study, electrochemical interfacing of PB nanocrystals with a thin film containing a redox-active Ru complex (Ru-NP) was investigated. Spontaneous growth of preferentially oriented PB nanocrystals was observed on an ITO electrode modified with a Ru-NP primer film, which was subsequently characterized by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Blocking and rectification of electron transport (ET) were observed between PB and the Ru complex, and this behavior was governed by the energy gap between the Ru complex and PB nanocrystals as well as the thickness of the Ru-containing primer layer film. ET rectification at the ITO parallel to(Ru-NP)(3)/PB heterojunction was supported by a potential-step chronoamperometry (PSCA) analysis of the i-t curves. Owing to the large difference between the forward and backward ET rates at the ITO parallel to(Ru-NP)(3)/PB heterojunction, a large hysteresis loop was observed during electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements, indicating dynamic ion transfer gating in the PB nanopores through the rectified electron transport between the Ru-NP layer and the ITO electrode at the ITO parallel to(Ru-NP)(3)/PB heterojunction.

TI Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance in Co-Fe Hydroxides
   through Boron Doping
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Among hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis stands out, but its efficiency is hampered by the substantial energy barrier of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To address this, incorporating electron-deficient boron (B) into Co-Fe hydroxide (CoFeOxHy) promotes higher oxidation states of involved metals, greatly enhancing OER activity and charge transfer capabilities. Herein, the synthesis of a range of amorphous CoFeB nanoparticles with varying Fe to (Co+Fe) atomic ratios achieved through a simple chemical reduction method using CoFe-Prussian blue analogs as precursors and employing M & ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy to observe structural characteristics before and after transformation is reported. Among these nanoparticles, the CoFe0.25B variant, exhibiting favorable electrochemical properties, is chosen and subsequently subjected to hydrolysis to yield CoFe0.25BOH nanoparticles, serving as an active catalyst for OER. At a current density of 10 mA cm-2, the overpotentials for CoFe0.25OxHy and CoFe0.25BOH are 362 and 310 mV, respectively, with Tafel slopes decreasing from 393 to 93 mV dec-1. Furthermore, the i-t test reveals no significant loss of electrochemical performance within 24 h, substantiating the efficacy of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of CoFeOxHy through the introduction of electron-deficient elements. This research offers novel insights into the development of efficient and stable water electrolysis catalysts.
   This study explores boron-doped CoFe hydroxides (CoFe0.25BOH), synthesized via chemical reduction. Boron doping enhances the iron oxidation state transition, significantly improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Specifically, at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, overpotentials reduced from 362 to 310 mV and Tafel slopes decreased from 393 to 93 mV dec-1, facilitating superior charge transfer.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH

TI Self-templating construction of hollow Fe-CoxP nanospheres
   for oxygen evolution reaction
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Rational design of catalysts with well-controlled structures and compositions has been demonstrated effective to optimize the electrochemical performance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable composition, morphology as well as porous structure are desirable for constructing various functional materials acting as precursors. In this work, a facile self-templating strategy is developed to synthesize hollow Fe-CoxP nanospheres. The solid Co-glycerate nanospheres are synthesized and used as self-sacrificing templates, which are converted to Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) via an anion-exchange process by reacting with K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] at room temperature, and then followed by phosphorization treatment to produce the Fe-CoxP. The transformation process endows the resultant product not only the hollow nanostructure, but also Fe atoms doping into the CoxP. By taking advantages of structural and compositional benefits as well as improved conductivity, the Fe-CoxP exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reaching the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 300 mV. The post-OER catalyst is carefully characterized and the results indicate the phase transformation of the crystalline Fe-CoxP to the amorphous FeCo (oxy)hydroxides acting as the catalytically active species. The novel self-templating strategy avoids the challenge from the removal of the template, which can possibly be employed to produce a sequence of PBA-based functional nanomaterials for applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

TI A Metal-Organic Framework Derived Porous Cobalt Manganese Oxide
   Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Hybrid Na-Air/Seawater Batteries
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Spinel-structured transition metal oxides are promising non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis in rechargeable metal-air batteries. We applied porous cobalt manganese oxide (CMO) nanocubes as the cathode electrocatalyst in rechargeable seawater batteries, which are a hybrid-type Na-air battery with an open-structured cathode and a seawater catholyte. The porous CMO nanocubes were synthesized by the pyrolysis of a Prussian blue analogue, Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O, during air anneal ing, which generated numerous pores between the final spinel-type CMO nanoparticles. The porous CMO electrocatalyst improved the redox reactions, such as the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions, at the cathode in the seawater batteries. The battery that used CMO displayed a voltage gap of similar to 0.53 V, relatively small compared to that of the batteries employing commercial Pt/C (similar to 0.64 V) and Ir/C (similar to 0.73 V) nanoparticles and without any catalyst (similar to 1.05 V) at the initial cycle. This improved performance was due to the large surface area (catalytically active sites) and the high oxidation states of the randomly distributed Co and Mn cations in the CMO. Using a hard carbon anode, the Na-metal-free seawater battery exhibited a good cycle performance with an average discharge voltage of similar to 2.7 V and a discharge capacity of similar to 190 mAh g(hard carbon)(-1) during 100 cycles (energy efficiencies of 74-79%).

TI Peculiarities of charge-discharge processes in Prussian white electrodes
   with different level of dehydration
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Prussian White (PW) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. PW exhibits advantages such as high specific capacity, ease of synthesis, and low cost. However, the presence of interstitial and coordinated water in PW materials significantly influences their electrochemical properties. In this work, a dehydration of the commercial PW powder and an impact of the preheating of the PW electrodes on their structural and electrochemical behavior have been examined using in situ/operando neutron and X-ray diffraction, along with complex TG-IR and FTIR techniques. The dehydration of the PW powder under the vacuum annealing conditions occurs mainly between 100 and 150 C-degrees. At temperatures above 180 C-degrees, a decomposition of the PW powder is detected. Preheating the electrode at 180 C-degrees promotes the formation of a larger fraction of dehydrated rhombohedral phase, resulting in higher capacity compared to electrodes without preheating and preheated at 140 degrees C. Carbon content has been shown to be an important factor for stable electrode cycling. Capacity values of similar to 100 mAh g(-1) and 83 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and 10 C-degrees cycling rates, respectively, are achieved when using 15 wt% content of carbon additive for the electrode preparation. Structural aspects of the degradation of PW electrodes during cycling are discussed.

TI Voltage Noise Failure Induced by Li Dendritic Micro-Penetration in
   All-Solid-State Li-Metal Battery with Composite Solid Electrolyte
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB All-solid-state Li-metal batteries (ASSLBs) are the most attractive next-generation batteries due to intrinsic safety and high energy density. Particularly, composite solid electrolyte (CSE)-based ASSLBs, highly compatible with conventional Li-ion batteries, are nearing commercialization. However, the understanding of ASSLBs' failure remains deficient, thereby considerably hindering their advancement. Herein, the unrecognized failing mode of ASSLBs, voltage noise failure (VNF), characterized by irregular charging voltage configuration, is identified using comprehensive techniques, including laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. The VNF originates from micro-penetration of Li dendrites, which is demonstrated through direct observation of 3D Li concentration map in CSE. In this phenomenon, the transition metals, dissolved from the cathode, hop to the anode and serve as seeds for dendritic growth in VNF. Inspired by this mechanism and with the aid of DFT calculations, a transition metal scavenging layer is proposed using Prussian blue analogue at the cathode-CSE interface. Consequently, ASSLBs with transition metal scavenging layer exhibit superior capacity (189 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C, NCM811) and stable cyclability (1200 cycles without failure).

TI Structural-electrochemical relations in the aqueous copper
   hexacyanoferrate-zinc system examined by synchrotron X-ray diffraction
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB The storage process of Zn2+ in the Prussian blue analogue (PBA) copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](2/3)-nH(2) O-CuHCF) framework structure in a context of rechargeable aqueous batteries is examined by means of in operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Via sequential unit-cell parameter refinements of time-resolved diffraction data, it is revealed that the step-profile of the cell output voltage curves during repeated electrochemical insertion and removal of Zn2+ in the CuHCF host structure is associated with a non-linear contraction and expansion of the unit-cell in the range 0.36 < x < 1.32 for Znx/3Cu[Fe(CN)(6)](2/3)-nH(2)O. For a high insertion cation content there is no apparent change in the unit-cell contraction. Furthermore, a structural analysis with respect to the occupancies of possible Zn2+ sites suggests that the Fe(CN)(6) vacancies within the CuHCF framework play an important role in the structural-electrochemical behavior of this particular system. More specifically, it is observed that Zn2+ swaps position during electrochemical cycling, hopping between cavity sites to vacant ferricyanide sites. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Dual resistance to chloride ion effects of PBA-derived self-supporting
   FeNi sulfide for high efficiency seawater oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Electrolysis of seawater is a promising approach to address freshwater scarcity and indirectly mitigate the energy crisis. In this context, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role as one of the half -reactions in water electrolysis. However, the development of cost-effective non -precious metal catalysts for OER remains a challenging issue. In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing Prussian blue sulfides supported on nickel foam (NF) at ambient temperature. The resulting S-FeNi@NF catalyst demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic performance with an overpotential of only 330 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm -2 in simulated seawater. Notably, the catalyst exhibits excellent corrosion resistance and electrochemical stability, maintaining its effectiveness for over 120 h following vulcanization. Furthermore, we assessed the catalysts for their resistance to chloride ion corrosion in natural seawater and observed no significant signs of etching for more than 30 days. This outstanding stability of the S-FeNi@NF material can be attributed to its dual protective mechanisms against chloride ions, which encompass both corrosion resistance and the repulsion of chloride ions during electrochemical processes. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on catalyst design, particularly in the context of shielding against chloride -induced degradation in direct seawater electrolysis.

TI Exploring the Role of Crystal Water in Potassium Manganese
   Hexacyanoferrate as a Cathode Material for Potassium-Ion Batteries
SO CRYSTALS
AB The Prussian Blue analogue K2-delta Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](1-gamma)center dot nH(2)O is regarded as a key candidate for potassium-ion battery positive electrode materials due to its high specific capacity and redox potential, easy scalability, and low cost. However, various intrinsic defects, such as water in the crystal lattice, can drastically affect electrochemical performance. In this work, we varied the water content in K2-delta Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](1-gamma)center dot nH(2)O by using a vacuum/air drying procedure and investigated its effect on the crystal structure, chemical composition and electrochemical properties. The crystal structure of K2-delta Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](1-gamma)center dot nH(2)O was, for the first time, Rietveld-refined, based on neutron powder diffraction data at 10 and 300 K, suggesting a new structural model with the Pc space group in accordance with Mossbauer spectroscopy. The chemical composition was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis combined with mass spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy microanalysis and infrared spectroscopy. Nanosized cathode materials delivered electrochemical specific capacities of 130-134 mAh g(-)(1) at 30 mA g(-)(1) (C/5) in the 2.5-4.5 V (vs. K+/K) potential range. Diffusion coefficients determined by potentiostatic intermittent titration in a three-electrode cell reached 10(-13) cm(2) s(-1) after full potassium extraction. It was shown that drying triggers no significant changes in crystal structure, iron oxidation state or electrochemical performance, though the water level clearly decreased from the pristine to air- and vacuum-dried samples.

TI Understanding the Catalytic Selectivity of Cobalt Hexacyanoferrate
   toward Oxygen Evolution in Seawater Electrolysis
SO ACS CATALYSIS
AB Hydrogen is a most desirable solar energy storage medium. It provides reliable, scalable, and long-term energy storage, while helping in the decarbonization of the energy cycle. Such a storage medium is required for further deployment of photovoltaics, either for their inclusion into transportation and heavy industries or for supporting renewable grid management. The most accessible hydrogen source is water. However, fresh water is a scarce resource, while seawater is abundant worldwide. A major drawback of seawater electrolysis comes from chloride oxidation competing with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This may produce toxic products such as chlorine and also limits the hydrogen energy efficiency of the overall process. Thus, selective catalysts toward the OER are of strong technological interest. Here we report the electrocatalytic activity of heterogeneous cobalt hexacyanoferrate toward seawater oxidation. Combining experimental and computational studies, we highlight the great difficulty in obtaining such selectivity and its main mechanistic descriptors. This Prussian blue derivative is an excellent and robust OER electrocatalyst, but unfortunately, it is not selective enough toward the OER in the presence of Cl- anions. Faradaic efficiencies above 30% toward Cl-2 were observed during untreated seawater bulk electrolysis.

TI A sustainable and low-cost route to prepare magnetic particle-embedded
   ultra-thin carbon nanosheets with broadband microwave absorption from
   biowastes
SO CARBON
AB Two-dimensional (2D) carbon nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention in the field of microwave absorption (MA) owing to their unique layered structure, tailorable atomic layer, tunable active surface, and high dielectric loss. Here, novel porous graphene-like heterostructures are facilely prepared through the carbonization of pomelo peel (PP)/prussian blue (PB) and PP/PB analogues (PBA). The magnetic particles derived from PB and PBA are uniformly distributed in the N-doped carbon (NC) ultra-thin nanosheets, which enhances the magnetic loss and improves the interfacial polarization. The optimized Fe/ZnO/NC-7 sample exhibits a maximum reflection loss (RLmax) of 58.12 dB at 2.05 mm, and an ultrabroad effective bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) of 7.6 GHz is achieved at 1.9 mm, which covers nearly half of the measured frequency range. The superior MA performance of Fe/ZnO/NC-7 composite is ascribed to the unique magnetic particle-embedded carbon nanosheet, which not only optimizes the impedance matching but also enhances the electromagnetic wave (EMW) attenuation ability through 2D conductive networks and multiple polarization processes. Overall, this work offers an environmentally friendly method to prepare low-cost and high-performance microwave absorbers from biowastes, which exhibit superior application potential as compared to other 2D microwave absorbers including graphene and MXene.

TI Spongelike Bimetallic Selenides Derived from Prussian Blue Analogue on
   Layered Ni(II)-Based MOF for High-Efficiency Supercapacitors
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Stabilization of different conformers of sandwich phthalocyaninates by changing the solvation environment has been demonstrated with the examples of new heteroleptic yttrium(III) and terbium(III) triple-decker complexes [(BuO)(8)Pc]M[(BuO)(8)Pc]M[(15C5)(4)Pc] (where M = Y or Tb, [(BuO)(8)Pc](2-) = octa-n-butoxyphthalocyaninato ligand, and [(15C5)(4)Pc](2-) = tetra-15-crown-5-phthalocyaninato ligand). To this end, we have performed a comprehensive crystallographic characterization of two solvates formed by the Y(III) complex with either toluene or dichloromethane. In the solvate with toluene, both pairs of Pc ligands are in staggered conformations, providing both metal cations with a square-antiprismatic environment. In contrast, in the solvate with dichloromethane, only one cation between the BuO- and 15C5-substituted ligands remains in a square-antiprismatic polyhedron, while the pair of BuO-substituted ligands switches to a gauche conformation. In both solvates, the staggered conformations are stabilized by weak interactions of peripheral substituents with solvent molecules. Detailed analysis of the H-1 NMR spectra of the isostructural Tb(III) complex in aliphatic and aromatic solvents demonstrates that the stabilization of the corresponding conformations by solvation is also valid in the solution state, resulting in an increase in the axial component of the magnetic susceptibility tensor as the symmetry decreases from staggered to gauche. Thus, solvation-induced conformational switching of lanthanide trisphthalocyaninates can be used as a tool to control their magnetic properties.

TI High-performance Ni/Fe-codoped manganese hexacyanoferrate by scale-up
   synthesis for practical Na-ion batteries
SO MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY
AB Manganese hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue (Mn-PB) is regarded as promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of high energy density, low cost and facile preparation route. However, poor rate capability and short cycle life restrain practical applications of Mn-PB. In this work, a Na-rich Mn-based Prussian blue with codoped Ni and Fe (MnFeNi-PB) was prepared via a citrate sodium-assisted coprecipitation route. The Ni/Fe codoping significantly increases rate capability and cycling performance of the Mn-PB. Even at 100 C, the MnFeNi-PB exhibits a high capacity of 84.0 mAh g(-1), with 72.8% capacity delivered relative to 0.1 C. The material also shows stable cycling with 65.6% capacity retained after 2000 cycles at a current density up to 5 C. Even under stringent circumstances, the MnFeNi-PB also exhibits a high capacity retention of 83.5% after 300 cycles at 45 degrees C and 92.1% after 700 cycles at -20 degrees C at 1 C. The enhanced rate capability and cycling performance is attributed to the increased electronic conductivity and stabilized crystal structure by Ni/Fe codoping. Scalable preparation of kilogram-grade MnFeNi-PB was realized using a 100 L reactor. Pouch-type Na-ion full battery with the MnFeNi-PB cathode shows stable cycling with 84.9% capacity retained after 200 cycles at 0.5 C/1 C current rate. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thin films of Co-filled CNTs were deposited over conductive substrates through a liquid-liquid interfacial method and were used for cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCFe) electrodeposition by an innovative route in which the Co species encapsulated in the CNTs were employed as reactants. The CNT/CoHCFe films were characterized by different spectroscopic, microscopic, and electrochemical techniques and presented high electrochemical stability in different media.

TI CoFe Alloy-Coupled Mo2C Wrapped by Nitrogen-Doped Carbon as
   Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) with a Pt-like d-band electron structure exhibits certain activities for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in alkaline solutions, but it is questioned due to its poor OER stability. Combining Mo2C with transition metals alloy is a feasible way to stabilize its electrochemical activity. Herein, CoFe-Prussian blue analogues are used as a precursor to compound with graphitic carbon nitride and Mo6+ to synthesize FeCo alloy and Mo2C co-encapsulated N-doped carbon (NG-CoFe/Mo2C). The morphology of NG-CoFe/Mo2C (800 degrees C) shows that CoFe/Mo2C heterojunctions are well wrapped by N-doped graphitic carbon. Carbon coating not only inhibits growth and agglomeration of Mo2C/CoFe, but also enhances corrosion resistance of NG-CoFe/Mo2C. NG-CoFe/Mo2C (800 degrees C) exhibits an excellent half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.880 V) for ORR. It also obtains a lower OER overpotential (325 mV) than RuO2 due to the formation of active species (CoOOH/beta-FeOOH, as indicated by in-situ X-ray diffraction tests). E-1/2 shifts only 6 mV after 5000 ORR cycles, while overpotential for OER increases only 19 mV after 1000 cycles. ORR/OER performances of NG-CoFe/Mo2C (800 degrees C) are close to or better than those of many recently reported catalysts.

TI Achieving a high-performance Prussian blue analogue cathode with an
   ultra-stable redox reaction for ammonium ion storage
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB Aqueous rechargeable batteries with advantages of safety, low cost, and environmental kindness have displayed high feasibility of practical applications for large-scale energy storage. Developing high-performance electrode materials is a necessary gateway to commercially available batteries. Here, we demonstrate the controlled synthesis of sodium iron hexacyanoferrates, (NaFeFeII)-Fe-III(CN)(6) (Na-FeHCFs). Ball-cutting Na-FeHCF nanocubes are first synthesized and used as a cathode material for aqueous ammonium-ion batteries. Due to fast charge transfer and diffusion, the ball-cutting Na-FeHCF nanocubes exhibit a high discharge capacity of 62 mA h g(-1) at 0.25 A g(-1) and 77.4% capacity retention at 2 A g(-1). Such excellent capacity and rate performance are superior to those of other Na-FeHCFs and the reported ammonium-ion intercalation cathodes. Furthermore, they present unparalleled cycling stability with no capacity loss over 50 000 cycles, thanks to the highly stable redox reaction of the high-spin nitrogen-coordinated Fe-II/Fe-III (Fe-H) couple. This work supplies a new view to design high-performance cathode materials for ammonium ion storage.

TI Boosted Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Activity via the Core-Shell
   Heterostructure of Nickel Sulfide Nanoframe-Supported Layered Rhenium
   Disulfide
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The strategic design of a heterostructure catalyst with a core-shell nanoarchitecture is imperative for enhancing the efficiency of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the core-shell catalyst comprising the rhenium disulfide nanosheets was vertically integrated onto a hollow nickel sulfide (NiS@ReS2) via coprecipitation and hydrothermal treatment. The morphology involves the sulfurization of a nickel-based Prussian blue analogue, effectively mitigating the aggregation of ReS2 nanosheets and maximizing the exposed active sites. By the synergistic effect of morphological design and heterostructure formation, the overpotential of NiS@ReS2 is 136 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte, and the rapid kinetics is confirmed by the small Tafel slope and low charge transfer resistance during the HER process. Moreover, the electrocatalytic durability of NiS@ReS2 is elucidated, and the boosted catalytic activity of NiS@ReS2 is confirmed by density functional theory. This study unveils a promising method for advancing ReS2-based electrocatalysts with potential implications for producing hydrogen.

TI Pressure Dependence of the Magnetic Ordering Temperature
   (Tc) for the Na2Mn[Mn(CN)6]
   Noncubic Prussian Blue Analogue
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The pressure dependence of the magnetic properties of rhombohedral Na2Mn[Mn(CN)(6)] up to 10 kbar has been studied. The magnetic ordering temperature, T-c, for Na2Mn[Mn(CN)(6)] reversibly increases with increasing applied hydrostatic pressure, P, by 9.0 K (15.2%) to 68 K at 10 kbar with an average rate of increase, dT(c)/dP, of 0.86 K/kbar. The magnetization at 50 kOe and remanent magnetization, M-r(H), remain constant with an average value of 13,100 +/- 200 and 8500 +/- 200 emuOe/mol. The coercive field H-cr increases by 12% from 13,400 to 15,000 Oe. The increase and rate of increase of T-c for rhombohedral Na2Mn[Mn(CN)(6)] are reduced with respect to monoclinic A(2)Mn[Mn(CN)(6)] (A = K and Rb), but they are still greater than those of cubic Cs2Mn[Mn(CN)(6)]. This is attributed to the compression of the MnNC framework bonding without decreasing angle Mn-II-N  C, maintaining the unit cell in accord with cubic A = Cs at lower applied pressures, and not due to reduction in angle Mn-II-N  C, which correlates with increasing T-c that is reported for A = K and Rb as well as Cs at higher applied pressures.

TI Highly efficient adsorption of Pb(II) by cubic nanocrystals in aqueous
   solution: Behavior and mechanism
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB As one of the most toxic heavy metal ions, lead pollution has become an urgent problem. Here, a cubic crystal nanoparticle (Prussian blue analogue, PBA), referred to as potassium manganese ferrocyanide (KMFC) was synthesized and used as a highly-effective sorbent for removing Pb(II) from aqueous solution. KMFC is a mesoporous material that has excellent ion exchange properties, which was confirmed by a series of characterizations. This paper investigated the adsorptive attributes of KMFC for lead ions in aqueous solution. The influences of temperature, contact time and pH on adsorption were studied in batch experiments. The KMFC possessed a robust adsorption capacity for resident lead ions in aqueous solution, which attained 1075.27 mg g(-1) at room temperature (25 degrees C), based on the Langmuir model, which was far higher than any previously reported values. The adsorption process was well fitted to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, as well as Langmuir and Temkin isotherm models, and was endothermic and spontaneous on the basis of thermodynamic analysis. The adsorption of Pb(II) on the surface of KMFC started with electrostatic attraction, due to the electronegativity of KMFC. Further, ion exchange was the dominant mechanism in this adsorption process, which was confirmed by FTIR, XPS, and other supplementary experiments. The good chemisorption (IC exchange) properties of KMFC suggested that it likely has excellent prospects in applications for heavy metal ions adsorption. This study not only provided a new perspective for the design and development of heavy metal sorbents but provided a deep insight into the mechanism of adsorption of heavy metal ions by PBA.

TI A Prussian-blue analogue (PBA) ion-chromatography-based technique for
   selective separation of Rb<SUP>+</SUP> (as RbCl) from brines
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB A new general method is presented for separating pure RbCl(s) from solutions rich in Na+ and K+. The method relies on Rb+ adsorption via ion exchange performed by self-synthesized PES coated Zn-Hexa-Cyanoferrate material. The procedure starts by passing the wastewater through an ion exchange column, which is thereafter regenerated with 1 M NH4Cl. If the Rb+ absorbed on the column does not reach a minimal predetermined value (e.g., 8%, eq-based), the ammonia is removed by sublimation and the remaining salts are passed again through a Na+-preadsorbed column. Once the adsorbed Rb+ is substantial (>8%), a chromatography-based separation between Rb+ and Na+/K+ is performed, using a 2(nd) column, fully pre-adsorbed with NH4+. First, 0.05M NH4+-solution is used to extract Na+ and K+ out of the first column, along with a small Rb+ mass, which is thereafter partly re-adsorbed on the second column, while Na+/K+ ions are not. Once the exiting eluent solution is devoid of the competing ions, 1M NH4+-solution is used to extract all the remaining Rb+ into the regeneration solution, which is thereafter subjected to water evaporation followed by NH3/HCl sublimation to result in pure RbCl(s) product. We used theoretical simulations corroborated by empirical results to present proof of concept for the suggested approach. A detailed cost analysis (Capex and Opex) reveals that the RbCl(s) production cost does not exceed similar to 25% of the current salt price.

TI Phytic Acid Customized Hydrogel Polymer Electrolyte and Prussian Blue
   Analogue Cathode Material for Rechargeable Zinc Metal Hydrogel Batteries
SO SMALL
AB Zinc anode deterioration in aqueous electrolytes, and Zn dendrite growth is a major concern in the operation of aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries (AZMBs). To tackle this, the replacement of aqueous electrolytes with a zinc hydrogel polymer electrolyte (ZHPE) is presented in this study. This method involves structural modifications of the ZHPE by phytic acid through an ultraviolet (UV) light-induced photopolymerization process. The high membrane flexibility, high ionic conductivity (0.085 S cm-1), improved zinc corrosion overpotential, and enhanced electrochemical stability value of approximate to 2.3 V versus Zn|Zn2+ show the great potential of ZHPE as an ideal gel electrolyte for rechargeable zinc metal hydrogel batteries (ZMHBs). This is the first time that the dominating effect of chelation of phytic acid with M2+ center over H-bonding with water is described to tune the gel electrolyte properties for battery applications. The ZHPE shows ultra-high stability over 360 h with a capacity of 0.50 mAh cm-2 with dendrite-free plating/stripping in Zn||Zn symmetric cell. The fabrication of the ZMHB with a high-voltage zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZHF) cathode shows a high-average voltage of approximate to 1.6 V and a comparable capacity output of 63 mAh g-1 at 0.10 A g-1 of the current rate validating the potential application of ZHPE.
   A novel phytic acid (PA) modulated zinc hydrogel polymer electrolyte (ZHPE) as an efficient electrolyte and separator for rechargeable Zn-metal hydrogel batteries (ZMHB) is designed. The zincophilic, and hydrogen bonding characteristics of ZHPE help in regulating uniform dendrite-free Zn-deposition over the Zn anode surface. ZHPE in combination with the developed high-voltage zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZHF) cathode performs as an efficient ZMHB. image

   fixation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB The electrochemical NRR to produce ammonia under ambient conditions represents an attractive prospect in nitrogen fixation which can greatly ease the energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, suffering from awful N-2 activation results in low ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency in electrochemical NRR. In this work, we devote to construct FeNi heteronuclear sites in FeNi-PBA with accurate coordination structure to facilitate N-2 activation employing a side-on configuration. Control experiments have verified N-2 activation on FeNi heteronuclear sites was enhanced compared with that on FeFe sites. Meanwhile, the particle size of PBA was decreased to boost active sites. FeNiPBA nanocrystals with ultrasmall size (10 +/- 2.8 nm) through microwave-assisted synthesis achieve an ammonia yield rate of 17.7 mgNH(3) gcat(-1) h(-1) and Faradaic efficiency of 27.5% at a bias of -0.2 V (V vs. RHE) in 0.05 M H2SO4 solution. Faradaic efficiency achieved in this work well exceeds than that of most Fe based transition metal electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI An electrode for a high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor made of
   rGO/PANI/PB ternary nanocomposite
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB The electrodeposition technique was used to create Prussian blue (PB), binary: rGO/PB, PANI/PB, rGO/PANI, and ternary: rGO/PANI/PB nanocomposites. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) methods were used to describe the samples. The results demonstrated the covering of PB by the rGO and PANI. The electrochemical characteristics of the studied materials were examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 2 M Na2SO4. The specific capacitance follows the order: rGO/PANI/PB > rGO/PB > PANI/PB > rGO/PANI> PANI > rGO > PB. The rGO/PANI/PB nanocomposite electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 336 F. g-1 in 2 M Na2SO4 at a discharge current density of 1 A. g-1 with 92 % retention of its original capacitance after 3000 cycles. The remarkable electrochemical performance of the ternary rGO/PANI/PB nanocomposite is attributed to its synergistic effects among individual components. The ternary electrode's high electrochemical performance indicates that it might be employed as an electrode for commercial supercapacitors. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was built using a positive electrode of rGO/PANI/PB and a negative electrode of activated carbon (AC). The arranged (ASC) operates continuously within the potential range of 0-1.8 V and delivers a high energy density of 56.3 Wh. kg- 1 at a power density of 8804 W. kg- 1, as well as 92 % retention of its original capacitance after 3000 cycles.

TI Self-assembly hollow manganese Prussian white nanocapsules attenuate
   Tau-related neuropathology and cognitive decline
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disease. However, to date, none of the developed drug candidates targeting at a single therapeutic target of AD have achieved success in clinical trials. Herein, we proposed a hypothesis of hollow manganese Prussian white nanocapsules (HMPWCs)-mediated attenuation of Tau-related pathology and alleviation of cognitive decline via simultaneously alleviating neuroinflammation, scavenging reactive oxygen species, and reducing hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins. The HMPWCs self-assemblied with manganese Prussian white analogue and bovine serum albumin via a novel biomimetic mineralization present good biocompatibility, variable valence states, and low oxidation-reduction potential. They own the outstanding capabilities of relieving oxidative stress, inhibiting Tau neuropathology, and counteracting neuroinflammation, which could be used to treat Tau-related AD-like neurodegeneration. Importantly, they can also attenuate the cognitive impairments of Tau-related AD-like rats without significant side effects. This research takes the advantages of catalytic chemistry, nanomedicine and specific neurodegenerative microenvironment together, providing an alternative efficient treatment strategy for Tau-related neurodegeneration diseases, such as AD, Pick's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and progressive supranuclear palsy.

TI Ion Tunnel Matrix Initiated Oriented Attachment for Highly Utilized Zn
   Anodes
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Metallic zinc is an ideal anode for aqueous energy storage; however, Zn anodes suffer from nonhomogeneous deposition, low reversibility, and dendrite formation; these lead to an overprovision of zinc metal in full cells. Herein, oriented-attachment-regulated Zn stacking initiated through a trapping-then-planting process with a high zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is reported. Due to the isometric topology features of cubic-type Prussian blue analog (PBA), the initial Zn plating occurs at specific sites with equal spacing of & AP;5 & ANGS; in the direction perpendicular to the substrate; the trace amount of zinc ions trapped in tunnel matrix provides nuclei for the oriented attachment of Zn (002) deposits. As a result, the PBA-decorated substrate delivers high reversibility of dendrite-free zinc plating/stripping for more than 6600 cycles (1320 h) and achieves an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5% at 5 mA cm(-2) with 100% ZUR. Moreover, the anode-limited full cell with a low negative-positive electrode ratio (N/P) of 1.2 can be operated stably for 360 cycles, displaying an energy density of 214 Wh kg(-1); this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries. This work provides a proof of concept design of metal anodes with a high utilization ratio and a practical method for developing high-energy-density batteries.

TI Completely Activated and Phase-Transformed KFeMnHCF for Zn/K Hybrid
   Batteries with 14 500 Cycles by an OH-Rich Hydrogel Electrolyte
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Metal hexacyanoferrates are recognized as superior cathode materials for zinc and zinc hybrid batteries, particularly the Prussian blue analog (PBA). However, PBA development is hindered by several limitations, including small capacities (<70 mAh g(-1)) and short lifespans (<1000 cycles). These limitations generally arise due to incomplete activation of redox sites and structure collapse during intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in PBAs. According to this study, the adoption of a hydroxyl-rich (OH-rich) hydrogel electrolyte with extended electrochemical stability windows (ESWs) can effectively activate the redox site of low-spin Fe of the KxFeyMn1-y[Fe(CN)(6)](w)center dot zH(2)O (KFeMnHCF) cathode while tuning its structure. Additionally, the strong adhesion of the hydrogel electrolyte inhibits KFeMnHCF particles from falling off the cathode and dissolving. The easy desolvation of metal ions in the developed OH-rich hydrogel electrolytes can lead to a fast and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in the PBA cathode. As a result, the Zn parallel to KFeMnHCF hybrid batteries achieve the unprecedented characteristics of 14 500 cycles, a 1.7 V discharge plateau, and a 100 mAh g(-1) discharge capacity. The results of this study provide a new understanding of the development of zinc hybrid batteries with PBA cathode materials and present a promising new electrolyte material for this application.

TI N, S-codoped CNTs supported Co4S3 nanoparticles
   prepared by using CdS nanorods as sulfur sources and hard templates: An
   efficient catalyst for reversible oxygen electrocatalysis
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Non-precious efficient bifunctional catalysts towards oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) are highly desired to enable the widespread application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries (r-ZABs). Herein, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) anchored on CdS nanorods (CdS NRs) pre-coated with polydopamine (PDA) are utilized as precursors to prepare ultrafine Co4S3 nanoparticles supported on N, S-codoped CNTs (Co4S3@N,S-CNT), where CdS NRs are served as sulfur sources and hard templates. After pyrolysis, the resulting Co4S3@N,S-CNT-800 shows a high specific surface area of 142.4 m(2) g(-1), together with merely 0.780 V difference between the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR potential at 3 mA cm(-2). The Co4S3@N,S-CNT-800 based air cathode displays a higher discharge capacity of 787 mAh g(Zn)(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2), a higher output power density of 154 mW cm(-2), better working stability, as well as a lower charge-discharge voltage gap than the Pt/C + RuO2 based air electrode at various working current density. The remarkable oxygen reversible catalytic activities are mainly attributed to the presence of a thin layer of mesoporous carbon on partial sections of the open-end N,S-CNTs, which not only shortens the mass diffusion length but also prevents N,S-CNTs from excessively bundling to maximize the exposure of Co4S3 nanocrystallites and graphitized carbon skeletons with N or S heteroatoms.

TI Activated MoS2 by Constructing Single Atomic Cation Vacancies
   for Accelerated Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Regulating the electronic structure of MoS2 by constructing cationic vacancies is an effective method to activate and improve its intrinsic properties. Herein, we synthesize the MoS2-based composite with abundant single atomic Mo cation vacancies through uniformly loading nickel-cobalt-Prussian blue analogues (NiCoPBA) (NiCoPBA-MoS2-V-Mo) by immersing a single Ni atom-decorated MoS2 (Ni-MoS2) into K-3[Co(CN)(6)] solution. Subsequently, NiCoP-MoS2-V-Mo with improved conductivity is obtained by phosphating the composite as a high-efficiency hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the electrons of NiCoP are spontaneously transferred to the substrate MoS2-V-Mo nanosheets in NiCoP-MoS2-V-Mo, and the moderately oxidized NiCoP is beneficial to the adsorption of OH*. Meanwhile, the mono-atomic Mo cation vacancies of the catalyst modulate the electronic structure of S, optimizing the adsorption of hydrogen in the reaction process. Therefore, NiCoP-MoS2-V-Mo has enhanced chemical adsorption for H* (on MoS2-V-Mo) and OH*(on NiCoP), expediting the water-splitting step and HER catalysis, and benefiting from the regulation of the electronic structure induced by the construction of metallic Mo vacancies in MoS2, the as-prepared catalyst displays an overpotential of only 67 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability (no current decay over 20 h). This work affords not only a kind of efficient HER catalysts but also a new valuable route for developing inexpensive and high-performance catalysts with single atomic cation vacancies.

   Hexacyanoferrate Films
SO MATERIALS
AB Sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (NaFeHCF) films were electrodeposited on Au/Cr/Si for the study of growth behavior and physical properties. The NaFeHCF films were studied by different analytical methods to prove the chemical composition, morphology and crystal structure. The grains of the film grow with a cubic structure with an average lattice parameter of 10.10 angstrom and the preferential growth direction along the [111] direction of the cubic cell. The films show a repeatable bipolar resistive switching behavior accompanied by high current changes (up to a factor of similar to 10(5)). The different resistive states in the materials are dominated by ohmic conduction.

TI Rocking-Chair Ammonium-Ion Battery: A Highly Reversible Aqueous Energy
   Storage System
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Aqueous rechargeable batteries are promising solutions for large-scale energy storage. Such batteries have the merit of low cost, innate safety, and environmental friendliness. To date, most known aqueous ion batteries employ metal cation charge carriers. Here, we report the first "rocking-chair" NH4-ion battery of the full-cell configuration by employing an ammonium Prussian white analogue, (NH4)(1.47)Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.88), as the cathode, an organic solid, 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), as the anode, and 1.0 m aqueous (NH4)(2)SO4 as the electrolyte. This novel aqueous ammonium-ion battery demonstrates encouraging electrochemical performance: an average operation voltage of ca. 1.0 V, an attractive energy density of ca. 43 Wh kg(-1) based on both electrodes' active mass, and excellent cycle life over 1000 cycles with 67% capacity retention. Importantly, the topochemistry results of NH4+ in these electrodes point to a new paradigm of NH4+-based energy storage.

TI One Versatile Route to Three-Dimensional Graphene Wrapped Metal Cyanide
   Aerogels for Enhanced Sodium Ion Storage
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Facile and controllable integration of metal cyanides (MCs) into three-dimensional graphene (3DG) with advantageous structures is of fundamental importance for the development of superior MC-based electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and catalysis. Here a facile and versatile spatially-confined Ostwald ripening strategy was developed to synthesize a series of 3DG wrapped MC aerogels with different compositions, size, and structure based on the chemical instability of MC in the reaction system. Remarkably, the integration of Prussian blue (PB) into 3DG, with such unique architecture, largely improves the rate performance and long-term cycling stability of PB as a cathode material for sodium ion batteries.

TI Preparation of a uniform thin-film Pd-Au electrocatalyst via
   electroreduction of a palladium hexacyanoferrate(II)-Au electrodeposit
   for alkaline oxidation of methanol
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB A multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and then Pd-Au thin film modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was prepared for alkaline electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol, by means of the cathodic deposition of a composite of palladium hexacyanoferrate(II) and gold (PdHCF-Au) on a MWCNTs-modified GCE in 10 mM PdCl2 + 10 mM K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] + 1.2 mM HAuCl4 + 0.5 M KCl + 0.5 M HCl aqueous solution, and then the cathodic reduction of the PdHCF-Au deposit in an alkaline aqueous solution to yield a uniform thin-film PdAu electrocatalyst. The materials and electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry. Under the optimal conditions, the electrocatalytic methanol-oxidation peak current (CV, -0.8 V similar to 0.5 V, 50 mV/s) on Pd-Au(PdHCF-Au)/MWCNTs/GCE was 15.4 mA cm(Pd)(-2) in 0.5 M aqueous KOH containing 1 M methanol, which is higher than those of the examined control electrodes and many reported Pd-based electrocatalysts. The use of electron-insulating PdHCF as a Pd precursor first suggested here can notably improve the Pd utilization and the electrocatalysis performance. The possible mechanism for the electrogeneration of Prussian blue from K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] in the absence of added ionic iron is also discussed.

TI Potassium-ion battery cathodes: Past, present, and prospects
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Since 2004, potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have shown the merits of high energy densities and high power densities at low costs. To further improve their overall performance, it is essential to understand the requirements for cathodes in KIBs and screen out structures targeting at accommodating large-sized K ions. In this review, reported KIB cathodes are classified according to their chemistries, crystal structures, and ionic storage mechanisms. For each category, electrochemical properties are compared in detail; advantages/disadvantages are given. Regarding the critical criteria for practical applications (low cost, long cycling lifespan, high energy density, and high power density), Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are the most suitable KIB cathodes now with a specific energy density of 535 Wh kg(-1) in half cells. Other cathodes such as tunnel-type manganese oxide, bilayered vanadium pentoxide, and some organic compounds also exhibit a stable energy density of >500 Wh kg(-1). The development of KIB cathode materials has enriched the fundamental understanding of materials design, synthesis, and ionic storage mechanisms. However, it is still a challenge nowadays to develop competitive high energy density KIB cathodes with a stable and long cycling life.

TI 9,10-Anthraquinone/K2CuFe(CN)6: A Highly
   Compatible Aqueous Aluminum-Ion Full-Battery Configuration
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Temporally intermittent and spatially dispersed renewable energy sources strongly call for large-scale energy storage devices. Aqueous aluminum-ion batteries show great potential for application due to their safety and low cost. Thus far, however, the ideal full-battery configuration is beyond the scope due to shortcomings with regards to suitable anode and cathode materials. Herein, we report a pioneering aqueous aluminum-ion battery system consisting of a Prussian white cathode, 1 M Al-2(SO4)(3) aqueous electrolyte, and an organic 9,10-anthraquinone anode. The oxidation capability of the Prussian white cathode during the first charging allows for the fabrication of the full battery without pre-inserting aluminum ions, thus making the rocking-chair-type battery feasible. Importantly, the open-framework structure of the Prussian white and distinct enolization charge storage mechanism of 9,10-anthraquinone ensure fast reaction kinetics. The full battery exhibits cycling stability with a capacity retention of 89.1% over 100 cycles at 500 mA g(-1), finishing a cycle in about 10 min. This work provides a pathway for developing rechargeable aqueous aluminum-ion batteries.

TI Aqueous proton batteries based on acetic acid solutions: mechanistic
   insights
SO MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY
AB Large grid energy storage devices are critical for the success of the clean and sustainable energy revo-lution. As Li-ion batteries are earmarked for electric vehicles and portable devices such as laptops and cellphones, other electrochemical systems should be developed that enable cost-effective, safe, and durable large-scale energy storage. Due to the low cost and non -flammability of aqueous electrolyte solutions, much effort is being put into the development of 'beyond-Li' batteries and super capacitors that can work in these environments. Here, we propose new proton batteries comprising an acetic acid electrolyte solution, NiII [FeIII(CN)6]2/3$4H2O Prussian blue analog cathodes, and Ti3C2Tx MXene anodes. Both electrodes were investigated independently to discover ideal settings for the electrochemical performance and stability. Significant attention was given to the cathodes' protons storage mechanism. In-situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation revealed that in acetic acid, hy-dronium and proton insertion contribute to charge storage, whereas in sulfuric acid-based electrolyte solutions, the main charge carriers are bare protons. 4.5 M acetic acid solution provided the best per-formance in terms of electrodes' capacitance and rate capability. The battery systems presented here show a promising direction but require further intensive optimization efforts. This research opens the way for research and development of novel proton batteries based on solutions containing common weak acids for more cost-effective and environmentally friendly energy storage systems.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Optimizing NH4<SUP>+</SUP> Storage Capability of Nickel
   Ferrocyanide by Regulating Coordination Anion in Aqueous Electrolytes
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB Will anions in electrolytes affect the electrochemical properties of Prussian blue analogues for aqueous ammonium ion batteries? In this study, the electrochemical reaction between nickel ferrocyanide and ammonium ions is investigated in three common inorganic ammonium salt solutions [NH4NO3, NH4Cl, and (NH4)(2)SO4]. The results suggest that at the same NH4+ concentration, nickel ferrocyanide exhibits different electrochemical performances. The as-prepared nickel ferrocyanide contains two phases, which are rhombohedral phase and cubic phase. Rhombohedral phase of nickel ferrocyanide has a high reactivity in 0.5 M (NH4)(2)SO4 solution during cycling while cubic phase shows good performance in 1 M NH4NO3 and 1 M NH4Cl electrolyte. It should be noted that the performance of cubic phase is superior to rhombohedral phase in kinetic consideration. Additionally, due to the strong coordination ability of chloride, nickel ferrocyanide exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance in 1 M NH4NO3 solution, rather than 1 M NH4Cl electrolyte.

TI Graphene aerogel encapsulated Co3O4 microcubes
   derived from prussian blue analog as integrated anode with enhanced
   Li-ion storage properties
SO CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
AB In lithium-ion batteries (LIB), cobalt oxide is considered an ideal anode material because of its theoretical specific capacity of up to 890 mAh g(-1), abundant resources, and low price. However, the volume expansion during the charging and discharging process and its lower conductivity have hindered its development. In this work, a metal-organic framework (MOF) was used as an initial template, encapsulated in graphene aerogels (GA) by hydrothermal and programmed temperature-controlled annealing and eventually formed into Co3O4 micro-cubes@GA composite. GA acts as a three-dimensional conductive network and mechanical skeleton, providing high electrical conductivity and structural stability to the composites. Moreover, the precursor's high porosity and stable structure are retained after annealing treatment. As an anode, the best long cycle life of Co3O4 microcubes@GA was achieved when the graphene oxide (GO) concentration was 3.0 mg ml(- 1), reaching 1234.9 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 A g(- 1) with a coulomb efficiency (CE) of 98.97%.

TI Simple fabrication of homogeneous Co/Co9S8/nitrogen doped carbon
   nanospheres derived from Prussian blue analogues for high performance
   supercapacitors
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB In this paper, an N-doped porous carbon (N-C) nanosphere containing a large amount of Co and Co9S8 nano -crystals (Co/Co9S8/N-C) is described. Among them, ZnCo-PBA (Zn3[Co(CN)6]2) was synthesized by simple method as the sacrificial template and carbon source. After calcination in N2, Co ions are reduced to Co, and zinc ions are vaporized to produce a large number of pores. Finally, it was vulcanized by hydrothermal method to form Co9S8 nanocrystals with high activity. Co/Co9S8/N-C nanomaterials have excellent specific surface area and mesoporous pores, which increase the charge transfer rate in the redox process and the performance. The ma-terial not only has excellent specific capacity (141.83 mAh g- 1/1542.64 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), but also retains good specific capacity after thousands of charges and discharges. To further test the value of Co/Co9S8/N-C electrodes, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled with a very high energy density (94.632 Wh kg-1) at 29368.55 W kg-1. The specific capacitance is about 80.70 % of the initial value after 5000 cycles. This strategy of using PBA as template to construct N-doped carbon skeleton embedded with metal sulfide provides a broad idea for supercapacitor electrode materials.

TI Intraphase Switching of Hollow CoCuFe Nanocubes for Efficient
   Electrochemical Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB This study addresses the urgent need to focus on the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2-RR) to ammonia (NH3). A ternary-metal Prussian blue analogue (CoCuFe-PBA) was utilized as the template material, leveraging its tunable electronic properties to synthesize CoCuFe oxide (CoCuFe-O) through controlled calcination. Subsequently, a CoCuFe alloy (CoCuFe-A) was obtained via pulsed laser irradiation in liquids. The electrochemical properties of CoCuFe-O, derived from the PBA crystal structure, demonstrated a high yield of NH4+ at a rate of 555.84 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2), with the highest Faradaic efficiency of 91.8% and a selectivity of 97.3% during a 1-h NO2-RR under an optimized potential of -1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the collaborative role of redox pairs (Co3+/Co2+ and Fe3+/Fe2+) as proton (H+) suppliers, with Cu centers serving as NO2- binders, thereby enhancing the reaction rate. Additionally, theoretical studies confirmed that Fe and Co atoms are more reactive than Cu toward intermediates playing crucial roles in hydrogenation, while Cu primarily activates NO owing to hydrogenation by the Fe and Co atoms and a high kinetic barrier in H2O* adsorption. This comprehensive investigation provides valuable insights into the electrochemical NO2-RR, establishing a foundation for efficient and sustainable NH3 synthesis strategies.

TI Prussian Blue Analogues Derived Heterostructured
   CoS2/FeS2 Particles Anchored on Carbon Nanosheets
   as Anodes for Boosted Sodium Storage Properties
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANORGANISCHE UND ALLGEMEINE CHEMIE
AB Pyrite FeS2 has emerged as promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, low electrical conductivity, large volume variation and shuttling effect generally lead to low specific capacity and inferior rate capability, greatly impeding its practical application. Here, heterostructured CoS2/FeS2 particles anchored on ultrathin carbon nanosheets (denoted as CoS2/FeS2/C) have been fabricated using a simple and facile co-precipitation combined with carbonization and gas sulfurization processes. The combination of bifunctional N-doped carbon nanosheets and unique heterostructure can provide better electrical conductivity, enhanced ion diffusion kinetics and offer reinforced structural integrity. Benefitting from the compositional and structural advantages, the as-prepared CoS2/FeS2/C hybrid composite exhibits boosted sodium storage properties, including outstanding rate capability (500.4 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)) and cycling stability with a retention of 95.8 % after 700 cycles.

TI Boosted activity of graphene encapsulated CoFe alloys by blending with
   activated carbon for oxygen reduction reaction
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB The slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) hampers the efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to a large extent, which usually requires catalysts to facilitate the electron transfer. The major challenge of the existed non-precious metals in place of the noble metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, Au et al.) for ORR is their low efficiency, which urgently needs special route to tackle this issue. Herein, we report a simple and convenient technique using prussian blue analogues as precursor to directly synthesize the N-doped graphene encapsulated CoFe alloy which is present in "Core-Shell" structure via calcination of Co2Fe(CN)(6) in inert condition. The encapsulation of metal alloy within graphene shell immensely promotes the electron transfer from the encapsulated metals to the graphene surface. It efficiently optimizes the electronic structure of the as-synthesized catalyst and thereby triggers high ORR activity. The surrounding activated carbon (AC) contributes to the large pore structure and further offers a commodious route for the oxygen to gain electron. Therefore, the total resistance of air cathodes is significantly reduced from 17.300 Omega to 9.5515 Omega and the electrochemical activity is greatly improved. The power performances of MFCs indicate that CoFe/C-10% presents the highest maximum power density (MPD) of 1616 mW m(-2), which is 5 times larger than that of the bare AC. It is well concluded that the graphene encapsulated CoFe alloy can be recognized as potential ORR catalyst for MFCs.

TI Prussian blue analogue-derived CoP nanocubes supported on MXene toward
   an efficient bifunctional electrode with enhanced overall water
   splitting
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The exploration of bifunctional catalyst with economic, durable, and efficient performance plays a crucial role to boost both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in overall water splitting. Herein, we report a feasible strategy to design effective heterostructure between CoP and Ti3C2Tx MXene (denoted as CoP/Ti3C2Tx). This approach allows for the growth of CoP nanoparticles with uniform size of 5 nm on the Ti3C2Tx MXene, further enhancing the water electrolysis efficiency. The CoP/Ti3C2Tx bifunctional catalyst demonstrates an exceptional HER activity with a satisfactory overpotential of 103 mV at 10 mA cm-2, and also can drive 10 mA cm-2 for OER with the overpotential of 312 mV in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, the CoP/Ti3C2Txbased electrolyzer exhibits high electrochemical stability for 24 h with a low required voltage of 1.66 V at 10 mA cm-2. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of Ti3C2Tx MXene significantly adjusts d-band center towards Fermi level and expand total density of states, resulting in great electrical conductivity, enhanced water adsorption, and activation. This study provides an available mode for effective design and construction of non-noble-metal-based dual-functional catalyst toward practical energy conversion.
