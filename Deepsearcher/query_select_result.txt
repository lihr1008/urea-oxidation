<think> Select agent [ChainOfRAG] to answer the query [In an alkaline environment for the urea oxidation reaction, design a high-entropy Prussian blue analog catalyst composed of five transition metals. This catalyst should not only exhibit high catalytic activity and stability but also meet multiple criteria including low cost, ease of synthesis, environmental friendliness, and corrosion resistance. Among common metal combinations, considering the balance between catalytic performance and structural stability, and aiming to avoid certain metals that may pose higher costs or environmental concerns, a tentative introduction of a metal element with stable valence states and environmentally benign characteristics is proposed to optimize catalyst performance. Please analyze in detail the rationale behind the selection of each of the five transition metal elements, elaborating on their contributions in terms of catalytic activity, stability, synthetic feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and structural features.] </think>

==== FINAL ANSWER====

The optimal five-metal high-entropy Prussian blue analog catalyst for urea oxidation in alkaline conditions is **Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Zn**.
**Rationale**:
1. **Ni**: Primary catalytic sites for urea oxidation, high activity, cost-effective.
2. **Fe/Co**: Synergistically enhance Ni’s catalytic activity via electronic modulation, improve redox properties.
3. **Mn**: Stabilizes the framework through Jahn-Teller suppression, low cost, environmentally benign.
4. **Zn**: Ensures structural stability via strong Zn─N bonds, mitigates corrosion, non-toxic.
This combination balances high entropy (structural stability), catalytic efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental compatibility while avoiding expensive/less-stable elements (e.g., Cu).
