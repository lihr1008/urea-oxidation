J	Huang, YL; Ren, SQ				Huang, Yulong; Ren, Shenqiang			Multifunctional Prussian blue analogue magnets: Emerging opportunities	APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY												There is a surge of interest to expand the search for entirely new classes of molecular magnets as the emergence of information storage and quantum computing devices. Prussian blue analogues as a family of molecular magnets are especially attracting wide attention due to their large number of derivatives with a range of magnetic ordering temperature from cryogenic to room temperature. This review presents Prussian blue analogues as multifunctional molecular magnets, which involves the development of molecular magnet syntheses and crystal structures, and magnetic properties under external stimuli. In addition, the porous network structures and vacancy order of Prussian blue analogues present a wide capability to interact with water molecules and gas adsorption. External stimuli, such as thermal, pressure, electric and magnetic field and photoexcitation, play an important role in controlling the hidden states and cooperative phenomena of high temperature molecular magnets based on Prussian blue analogues.

Nonetheless, their intrinsic electrochemical activity and electrical conductivity are poor, which hinder their applications in energy conversion and storage. In catalytic applications, metal compounds derived from PB/PBAs have a lot of advantages, such as outstanding stability, selectivity, and electrical conductivity. Furthermore, they can be used as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion, while having preferable electronic conductivity, sufficient catalytic active sites, as well as a larger specific surface area and tunable size to achieve an optimized performance.

In sharp contrast to macroporous-only Prussian blue analogues, the hierarchically superstructured porous Prussian blue materials are demonstrated to possess a high capacitance, which is similar to those of the conventional hybrid graphene/MnO2 nanostructured textiles.

The growth and particle size of NizFe-PB-x-y can be adjusted by changing the ammonium persulfate concentration (x) and hydrothermal temperature (y). To explore the role of individual reactants, three other catalysts were synthesized by changing the reaction conditions, including sea urchin-like FeOOH, Fe-4[Fe(CN)(6)](3) cube, and NiFe PBA/FeOOH grain. During the reaction, ammonium persulfate may acted as a promoter and oxidant, sodium citrate as a reducing agent and morphological regulator, potassium ferricyanide as a single iron source, and nickel foam as a nickel source and substrate. More importantly, compared with other catalysts, the electrochemically activated Ni0.59Fe-PB-3-110 catalyst manifests the most outstanding catalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution, with current densities of 50 and 800 mA cm(-2), requiring only 230 and 305 mV overpotential, respectively. It is anticipated that the novel strategy will not only contribute to the design and development of hierarchical three-dimensional PB or PBAs supported by conductive substrates, but also further promote their applications in the field of electrocatalysis and energy storage.					liu, zhifang/KIJ-0501-2024														0169-4332	1873-5584				NOV 30	2021	567								150835	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150835		AUG 2021											WOS:000691195700007

PBA are promising as cathode material for a number of different battery types, including K-ion and Na-ion batteries with both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. PBA exhibit a significant degree of structural variation. The structure of the PBA determines the electrochemical performance, and it is, therefore, important to understand how synthesis parameters affect the structure of the obtained product. PBA are often synthesized by co-precipitation of a metal salt and a hexacyanoferrate complex, and parameters such as concentration and oxidation state of the precursors, flow rate, temperature and additional salts can all potentially affect the structure of the product.

Herein, Prussian blue analogs were prepared by the controlled doping of nickel-cobalt bimetallic ions to improve their desalination capacity and stability. Process parameters such as cell potential, current, inlet flow rate, and solution concentration were investigated to determine the optimal conditions for Prussian blue desalination, and a high-performance Prussian blue analog (CNF-4) was successfully synthesized by accurately controlling the nickel-cobalt doping ratio. The desalination capacity and rate of CNF-4 (Ni:Co=1:2) reached 65.31 mg g-1 and 4.38 mg g-1 min- 1, respectively, and 98% of the capacity retention rate was maintained after 50 cycles of desalination. The excellent capacity and performance of the CNF-4 material indicate its superiority to conventional PBA CDI electrodes and its prospective applications in seawater desalination.																			0013-4686	1873-3859				FEB 20	2023	442								141815	10.1016/j.electacta.2023.141815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2023.141815		JAN 2023											WOS:000921936000001

Combining these results, Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, the shear modulus, and the transversal/longitudinal sound velocities have been calculated for each particle size.

Recent research efforts have been devoted to architecting CPs that satisfy the needs of applications that have recently been developed. Herein, we announce a survey of the latest developments in the synthesis of Prussian blue (PB) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) cyano-bridged CPs. The recent synthetic concepts and the modest control over the shape and size of particles are demonstrated to the present. Various ways have been taken to construct nanostructured inorganic materials from PB and PBAs. We surveyed one such example: the thermal decomposition of these materials in different environments. The regulated thermal treatment of their nanostructures as precursors, in air or inert atmosphere, yields nanoporous metal oxides and carbides or alloys, respectively. The resulting metal frameworks participate as metal sources, and the organic components, which can be removed by a simple process of calcination, produce pores. The original morphologies are almost retained, even after the thermal treatments. This strategy has proved to be a promising solid-state chemistry for the fabrication of nanoporous metal oxides and carbides or alloys with the similar morphology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It should be emphasized that the as-prepared nano-heterojunctions also showed amazing bacterial elimination efficiency in sewage. The antibacterial mechanism was also investigated using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. It can be attributed to the formation of unique nanoheterojunctions between PB and PBA, which improves the absorption of NIR light and facilitates the separation of generated electron-hole pairs.

Interest in this class of materials arises from their broad pore distribution, redox properties, high biocompatibility, low-cost components, straightforward manufacturability, and adaptability through analog development. A key challenge is the synthesis of well-defined, small-dimensioned materials using machine learning approaches. This study presents a strategy to address this limitation via machine learning-driven microfluidic synthesis. Employing unsupervised Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes effectively reduces optimization time and minimizes the need for prior knowledge. As a proof of concept, Prussian blue, and cobalt-based analogs are synthesized, with UV-vis spectroscopy providing feedback for the machine learning algorithm. The optimized protocols are subsequently applied to larger-scale preparations, demonstrating that the standardized methods have the potential for the commercial production of high-quality materials. Comprehensive characterization of the materials confirms their cubic morphology, small dimensionality, and mixed-valency of the metal elements.

Herein, we develop a one-pot method to fabricate regioselective super-assembly of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) -- a PBA anisotropic structure (PBA-AS) decorated with epitaxial modules--using a step-by-step epitaxial growth on a rapidly selfassembled cubic substrate guided by thiocyanuric acid (TCA) molecules. The epitaxial growth units manifest as diverse geometric shapes, which are predominantly concentrated on the {100}, {111}, or {10 0}+{1 1 1} crystal plane of the cubic substrate. The crystal plane and morphology of epitaxial module can be regulated by changing the TCA concentration and reaction temperature, enabling a high level of controllability over specific assembly sites and structures. To illustrate the advantage of the asymmetrical structure, phosphated PBA-AS demonstrates improved performance in the oxygen evolution reaction compared to simple phosphated PBA nanocube. This method offers valuable insights for designing asymmetrical nanomaterials with intricate architectures and versatile functionalities.

Nevertheless, in between cyanide-bridged extended coordination polymers and discrete molecules, the photo-switching phenomena are much less well known in nano-sized materials. A photo-induced transformation, specific to the nanometric size, is evidenced by magnetometry and by X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Co and Fe K-edges in an alkali cation free Prussian blue analog. The nanoparticles before irradiation can be described as having a core-shell structure, the core being made of the well-known fcc-Co-II(HS)Fe-III structure of CoFe PBAs while the shell contains Co-II ions in octahedral geometry and significantly distorted Fe(CN)(6) entities. Irradiation induces a change of the local structures around the transition metal ions, which remain in the same oxidation state, with different behaviors of the Co and Fe sub-lattices.

Mesoframes, as a class of mesostructures, have short diffusion pathways for guest species and thus can be an ideal platform for fast storage of guest ions. We report a synthesis of Prussian Blue analogue mesoframes by top-down etching of cubic crystals. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the surfaces of the cubic crystals were selectively removed by HCl, leaving the corners, edges, and the cores connected together. The mesoframes were used as a host for the reversible insertion of sodium ions with the help of electrochemistry. The electrochemical intercalation/de-intercalation of Na+ ions in the mesoframes was highly reversible even at a high rate (166.7 C), suggesting that the mesoframes could be a promising cathode material for aqueous sodium ion batteries with excellent rate performance and cycling stability.

It was established that the decomposition process of all the studied compounds in air ends up to 450-500 degrees C, and mass loss continues up to 1000 degrees C in argon. Solid products of thermolysis are oxides of central ions (NiO, CuO, Co3O4, Fe3O4) in air; mixtures of metals or Ni3Fe (III) in argon; Ni and Co (I) and Ni3Fe + Fe(III), and mixtures of Cu + Co (II) and Cu + Fe(IV) in hydrogen. Hexacyanocobaltates are reduced at lower temperatures and more fully than hexacyanoferrates under the same conditions.

Despite the extensive exploration of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with threedimensional (3D) open frameworks as SC electrodes, their instability and low conductivity have impeded their advancement in practical SC applications. In this study, we present a straightforward immersion-based technique to produce a superstructure nanoarray of CoNiFe-based PBA (CoNiFePBA). The unique superstructure comprises ultrathin nanosheets assembled into a half-open hollow configuration, fostering abundant active surface sites, a stable framework, and efficient channels for ion/electron transfer, consequently enabling effective charge storage. Furthermore, the integration of ternary metals not only offers numerous redox reaction centers but also heightens synergistic effects, resulting in enhanced capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the CoNiFePBA electrode delivers outstanding specific capacity (96.85 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and enduring cycling stability (92.25 % after 10,000 cycles). Notably, the hybrid SC built on the CoNiFePBA demonstrates an exceptionally broad voltage window (2.1 V) and a high energy density. This work underscores the immense potential of CoNiFePBA superstructure nanoarrays for driving high-performance SC technology forward.

A key challenge faced by AIBs is the lack of suitable cathode materials for rapid Al-ion insertion /extraction. Herein, K2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)] 2H(2)O (KMHCF) is innovatively chosen as a model to investigate the aluminum storage performance of Prussian blue analogues in nonaqueous AIBs. As anticipated, the KMHCF allows for reversible aluminum storage and exhibits characteristic charge/discharge plateaus. Furthermore, carbon combined highly crystalline KMHCF (HC-KMHCF@C) is synthesized through a chelator-assisted preparation method in combination with an in situ carbon compositing technique. With reduced [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) defects, lower interstitial water content, and enhanced conductivity, HC-KMHCF@C exhibits a high aluminum storage capacity (146.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1)) and satisfactory cycling performance (maintaining 86.4 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles). The electrochemical reaction mechanism of HC-KMHCF@C is investigated in detail. During the initial charge, K+ ions are extracted, shifting the structure from monoclinic to cubic. In subsequent cycles, reversible Al3+ insertion and extraction cause the structure to alternate between monoclinic and cubic phases.																			2366-9608					2024 AUG 30	2024									2401000	10.1002/smtd.202401000	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202401000		AUG 2024						39212650					WOS:001303948800001

This study presents a novel uniform hollow S-doped NiCuFe Prussian blue analogue (NiCuFe-S) with satisfactory size and properties as anticancer agents for efficient cervical cancer therapy using a simple and environmentally friendly procedure. Methods: The formation mechanism and the reason for enhanced performance of NiCuFe-S were characterized and discussed by diverse spectroscopic and microscopic methods. Moreover, to demonstrate the anti-cancer ability of NiCuFe-S, in vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out. Results: Compared to the non-doped NiCuFe, the NiCuFe-S exhibited significantly enhanced photothermal and catalytic activity attributed to the electronic bandgap-narrowing effect and the increased electron circuit paths resulting from S doping. The hollow structure of NiCuFe-S facilitated the loading of small-molecule drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), transforming it into a multimodal nanoplatform for cervical cancer treatment. In vitro and in vivo experiments proved the potential of the NiCuFe-S nanotheranostic agent for chemodynamic therapy (CDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and chemotherapy for cervical cancer.

Their excellent stability and high specific capacity in aqueous electrolytes make them an attractive choice for ASIBs cathode materials. In this review, the research progress on PBAs as cathodes for ASIBs is discussed. Their crystal structure and sodium storage mechanism are elucidated, and strategies to improve the performance of PBAs are summarized in depth at the material level. New insights are put forward aiming to provide ideas for improving cycling performance, avoiding electrode dissolution, and improving energy density of PBAs for ASIBs. In addition, the performance and current issues of full cells are summarized and discussed to evaluate the commercialization potential of ASIBs, providing an outlook on research directions in the development of high-performance aqueous batteries in grid-scale applications. Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) are a compelling option for energy storage systems. The advantages and challenges of Prussian blue analogues as cathode materials for ASIBs are highlighted.

The PBA-qnz was synthesized by mixing an excess aqueous solution of zinc chloride with an aqueous solution of precursor sodium pentacyanido(quinazoline)ferrate. The PBA-qnz was characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. The stable signal of PBA-qnz at +0.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl, referring to the reduction of iron ions, was used as an internal reference for the ratiometric sensor, which minimized deviations among multiple assays and improved the precision of the method. Furthermore, the PBA-qnz-based sensor provided higher current responses for butralin compared to the bare carbon paste electrode. The calibration plot for butralin was obtained by square wave voltammetry in the range of 0.5 to 30.0 mu mol L-1, with a limit of detection of 0.17 mu mol L-1. The ratiometric sensor showed excellent precision and accuracy and was applied to determine butralin in lettuce and potato samples.

Performance of Water Oxidation by 3D Printed Electrodes Modified by Prussian Blue Analogues	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												The water oxidation is the limiting step in the water-splitting process. Given this scenario, the development of new catalysts is essential in this field. The emergent demand is the use of Earthabundant elements and catalysts with high performance under mild conditions. Because of this, catalysts such as Prussian Blue analogues (PBA) have been receiving a lot of attention in recent years. In addition, working under neutral conditions allows us to take advantage of the modification of conductive polymeric 3D printed electrodes (3DPE) with Prussian Blue. Thus, we described in this work the development of the polymeric 3D printed electrodes modified by cobalt-Prussian Blue and their performance in the water oxidation process. The 3D printed electrodes modified with Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) (Co-Co PBA) have a Tafel slope of 343 mV dec(-1) while those modified with Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) (Co-Fe PBA) have a Tafel slope of 378 mV dec(-1). This means that both catalysts have the same mechanism for the water oxidation process. On the other hand, the overpotential of Co-Co PBA in 3DPE is lower than the value observed by Co-Fe PBA in 3DPE suggesting the best electrocatalytic activity for Co-Co PBA catalyst.

We report herein a synergistic remediation method for cleaning cesium-contaminated clay by Prussian blue analogue-functionalized magnetic microgel along with ionized chitosan. The magnetic microgels were prepared by surface polymerization of 4-vinyl pyridine and styrene on magnetite nanoparticles and attachment of Prussian blue analogues by ligand exchange reaction. The adsorption of cesium ions by magnetic microgels in aqueous solution follows the second-order kinetics process. And the maximum adsorption capacity was determined to be 149.70 mg/g by Langmuir adsorption model. When ionized chitosan hydrochloride was mixed with cesium-contaminated clay, we found that 200 mg/g clay of chitosan hydrochloride can realize 87.6 % of cesium release from clay within 2 h. Further use of magnetic microgel adsorbents can adsorb 95.5 % free cesium ions in solution, achieving an overall 83.7 % cleaning efficiency from cesium-contaminated clays. The microgels can be regenerated effectively and recycled magnetically while keeping the adsorption capacity constant after multiple times of use. The underlying principle demonstrated in this work can be extended to remediation of other types of radionuclides or heavy-metal ions in contaminated soil.

However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge-discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, a self-healing strategy is designed to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that a trace amount of cobalt can decelerate the crystallization process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controls the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realize the "electrochemically driven dissolution-recrystallization process" for the periodic self-healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA are also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self-healing electrodes for cathodes.

Can Prussian Blue Analogues be Holy Grail for Advancing Post-Lithium Batteries?	BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS												The recent classification of lithium as a critical raw material surged the research and development (R&D) of post-lithium batteries (PLBs). The larger cation charge carriers of these PLBs consequently entailed extensive materials R&D for battery components, especially cathode. Prussian Blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for PLBs due to their desirable characteristics, including a three-dimensional open framework structure that facilitates fast ion diffusion for both monovalent (Li+, Na+, K+) and multivalent (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+) ions, stable framework structures, electrochemical tunability, availability of widely used precursors, and ease of synthesis. Our comprehensive review reveals that several challenges are yet to be addressed in employing PBAs as cathode materials for PLBs, viz., vacancies, crystal water, side reactions, and conductivity issues. This review paper provides an exhaustive survey of material development, including the mitigation strategies of the challenges in employing PBAs as cathode materials for advancing PLBs (i. e., sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), potassium-ion batteries (KIBs), magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs), calcium-ion batteries (CIBs), zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs)) towards commercialization. This review provides comprehensive information on the electrochemical performance of Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) as cathode materials for Post-Lithium Batteries (PLBs) with a special emphasis on performance optimization strategies to address the challenges for its development. The critical parameters for commercializing PBA-based PLBs were also discussed, as well as future research directions and technology prospects. image						Sanglay, Giancarlo Dominador/0000-0002-7730-3806; Limjuco, Lawrence/0000-0001-5256-0665														2566-6223				OCT	2024	7	10								10.1002/batt.202400280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/batt.202400280		AUG 2024											WOS:001303049200001

However, it remains a challenge to directly employ PBA as an electrocatalyst for water splitting owing to their poor charge transport ability and electrochemical stability. Herein, the PBA/rGO heterostructure is constructed based on structural engineering. Graphene not only improves the charge transfer efficiency of the compound material but also provides confined growth sites for PBA. Furthermore, the charge transfer interaction between the heterostructure interfaces facilitates the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction of the composite, which is confirmed by the results of the electrochemical measurements. The overpotential of the PBA/rGO material is only 331.5 mV at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with a small Tafel slope of 57.9 mV dec(-1), and the compound material exhibits high durability lasting for 40 h.

Prussian blue is a star material and medicine for intracellular and extracellular therapy of Cs+. However, it and its analogues are essentially unstable in alkali-solution and seawater due to break down easily into the hazardous cyanide substance. In this study, copper ferrocyanide/ magnetic montmorillonite composites (KCuFC/M-MT) were prepared using an in-situ synthetic method. This method can inhibit the decomposition of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and the production of toxic cyanide. The 5KCuFC/M-MT composites exhibit excellent Cs+ adsorption properties (204.48 mg/g), good material chemical stable over a wide pH region (2 < pH < 12), safe amount of cyanide release (<0.2 mg/L, EPA, USA), and low-toxic to human hepatocytes (HepG2 cells), which are promising for the application in radioactive wastewater treatment. The adsorption mechanism and stabilization mechanism were systematically studied. This study provides a reference for the control radioactive Cs+ hazards by using clay material stabilized ferrocyanide material and provides a new direction for the research of cesium-control materials. This research solves the problem of basic instability of PBAs and expands new application fields for PBAs, especially decorporation agent for internal contamination by radiocesium.					yang, shubin/MFJ-3821-2025														1383-5866	1873-3794				NOV 15	2023	325								124662	10.1016/j.seppur.2023.124662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2023.124662		JUL 2023											WOS:001052124200001

J	Zhu, SO; Li, N; Zhang, DP; Yan, TJ				Zhu, Shuao; Li, Na; Zhang, Dapeng; Yan, Tingjiang			Metal/oxide heterostructures derived from Prussian blue analogues for efficient photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons	JOURNAL OF CO2 UTILIZATION												Solar-driven CO2 hydrogenation to synthesize value-added products with two or more carbons (C2+), such as paraffins and olefins, provides an alternative and potential route to solve both issues of energy shortage and environmental pollution. Nevertheless, it remains challenge to develop an efficient catalyst with high selectivity toward C2+ production. Herein, a series of NiFe-based catalysts have been successfully fabricated by thermal treatments of NiFe-Prussian blue analogues (NiFe-PBAs) in continuous air and H2 conditions. Upon H2 reduction at 250-500 degrees C, the obtained samples (denoted as NiFe-x) with chemical compositions of oxides, metal/oxide heterostructures and alloys, can be finely tuned. Under UV-Vis light irradiation, the NiFe-x catalysts display distinct CO2 hydrogenation performance, among which NiFe-300 catalyst affords a state-of-art CO2 conversion of 34.7 % and C2-4 selectivity of 33.6 %, respectively. Comprehensive characterizations using X-ray absorption fine structure, Mo center dot ssbauer spectroscopy and steady-state photoluminescence reveal that the best-performance of NiFe-300 catalyst was composed of NiFex alloys and Fe2O3 oxides, in which the formed heterostructure can facilitate efficient charge separation and increase the surface charge density, leading to the high selectivity to C2-4 products. This study demonstrates that the Prussian blue analogues offer a new platform for the development of solar-driven catalysts for the production of value-added hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation.					yan, tingjiang/F-5292-2017														2212-9820	2212-9839				OCT	2022	64								102177	10.1016/j.jcou.2022.102177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2022.102177		AUG 2022											WOS:000877994000002
J	Liang, XH; Wang, GH; Gu, WH; Ji, GB				Liang, Xiaohui; Wang, Gehuan; Gu, Weihua; Ji, Guangbin			Prussian blue analogue derived carbon-based composites toward lightweight microwave absorption	CARBON												Carbon-based composites derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much interest for microwave absorption. However, most studies only focus on the influence of heating temperature rather than the composition of derivatives on microwave absorption ability. In this work, four kinds of derivatives are obtained from Prussian blue analogue (PBA) after heating treatment. It is found that the annealing atmosphere has a significant influence on material compositions, thus the electromagnetic (EM) parameters and carbon graphitization degree are tuned. As a result, the CoFe/Carbon (CoFe/C) composite was derived from CoFe-PBA precursor with Ar atmosphere, which reached minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value of -44.6 dB and effective absorption bandwidth (f(e), the RL value less than -10 dB) of 5.5 GHz at 2.15 mm. For the NiFe/Carbon (NiFe/C) composite, the RLmin of -41 dB and f(e) of 4.8 GHz can be obtained at the thickness of 1.65 mm. The optimal f(e) of 6.0 GHz is obtained when the matching thickness was 2.0 mm. Given the lightweight, ultrathin, strong microwave attenuation capability, as well as broad effective absorption bandwidth, these carbon-based composites derived from PBA precursors are promising for practical applications.

By a one-step solution method, the composite of carbon dots/Prussian blue analogues nanocubes-incorporated three-dimensional Ni foams was prepared and used as a self-standing positive electrode for hybrid electrochemical capacitors (HEC). Aside from the role of Ni source for Prussian blue analogues (PBA), Ni foams acts as 3D conductive supports, making electrolytes more accessible to the internal surface of electrode. Meanwhile, carbon dots can be absorbed for the formation of carbon dots/PBA nanocubes on Ni foams surfaces, offering optimized interfaces for the interactions between electrodes and electrolytes and relieving the decomposition of PBA in alkaline electrolyte. With these merits, the carbon dots/Prussian blue analogues nanocubes-Ni foams electrode in the hybrid electrolyte of 0.5 M KOH and 1.3 M Na2SO4 exhibits a maximum specific capacity of 659 C g(-1) at current density of 0.5 A g(-1) and 344 C g(-1) even under large current density of 5 A g(-1). An extended working potential window of 1.8 V, high energy density of 65 Wh kg(-1) and high power density of 4.052 kW kg(-1) as well as improved cyclic stability are also achieved in the assembled HEC. This study builds a boulevard to improve the application potential of PBA in HEC, which will be beneficial for the development of supercapacitors. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have emerged as promising cathode materials due to their affordability, high theoretical capacity, and cycling stability. However, low crystallinity can negatively impact their performance. This study introduces a straightforward "chelating agent-assisted" method for producing highly crystalline PBAs. The resulting cathode boasts excellent characteristics, including a high capacity of 150 mAh g(-1), an initial Coulombic efficiency of 87.2 %, a long cycling lifespan of 1000 cycles, and superior rate performance. Furthermore, the study shows that the low structure distortion and high sodium diffusion coefficient can be attributed to the suppression of structural defects, as evidenced by in situ synchrotron powder diffraction. We believe these findings have the potential to enable the widespread use of PBAs in sodium-ion batteries for an affordable and large-scale energy storage system.

Different functional groups and surface charge distributions on carbon cloth have significant effects on the morphologies and nanostructures of Mn-based Prussian blue analogues, thereby indirectly affecting their physicochemical properties. Combined with the advantages of the modified carbon cloth and the nanostructured Mn-based Prussian blue analogues, the composite with negative surface charge formed by the electronegativity differences shows good electrochemical properties, leading to improvement in charge efficiency during capacitive desalination. An asymmetric device fabricated with Mn-based Prussian blue analogue-modified F-doped carbon cloth as the cathode and acid-treated carbon cloth as the anode presents the highest salt adsorption capacity of 10.92 mg g(-1 )with a charge efficiency of 82.28% and the lowest energy consumption of 0.45 kW h m(-3 )at 1 V due to the main influencing factor from the negative surface charge leading to co-ion expulsion boosting the capacitive deionization performance. We provide insights for further exploration of the relationship between second-phase materials and carbon cloth, while offering some guidance for the design and preparation of electrodes for desalination and beyond.

The 3% K-doping (K-FeMnPBA3) demonstrates a much-reduced water content of 6.9%, accompanied by a notably enhanced capacity of 139.1 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and a remarkable capacity retention of 77.1% after 700 cycles. Furthermore, the K-FeMnPBA3/hard carbon (HC) pouch cell achieves a stable cyclability with 82.6% capacity retention after 600 cycles.

J	Hayashi, H				Hayashi, Hisashi			Precipitation Patterns in Reaction-Diffusion-Reaction Systems of Prussian Blue and Cu-Fe-Based Prussian Blue Analogs	FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS												In agarose gel containing [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions and sandwiched between two metal rods (Ti, Fe, or Cu) with a voltage of 1-5 V applied for 20-100 h, reaction-diffusion-reaction (RDR) processes (that is, electrochemical reactions at metal rods to generate reactant ions, diffusion of the reactant ions influenced by the electric field in agarose gel, and reactions of the reactant ions to form/decompose precipitates) were coupled to generate diverse precipitation patterns of Prussian blues (PB) or Cu-Fe-based Prussian blue analogs (Cu-Fe PBA). These patterns strongly depended on the type of metal electrode, applied voltage, initial [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) concentration, and elapsed time after voltage application. Under the application of 2 V for 20/50 h, the PB/Cu-Fe PBA formed a discrete precipitation band on the anode/cathode side in an agarose gel containing 0.050 M [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions. In the Cu-Fe PBA system, a relatively long precipitation band of Cu(OH)(2) was also generated on the anode side by OH- ions produced on the cathode as a byproduct. Longer voltage applications promoted propagation of the Cu-Fe PBA band to the anode side and caused the discrete PB band to disappear. Higher initial [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) concentrations deepened the color of the generated patterns. Higher voltage applications suppressed the propagation of the Cu-Fe PBA band to the anode side and caused the PB band to disappear. Experiments using a Ti cathode suggested that the formation and subsequent decomposition of PB or Cu-Fe PBA at the cathode surface are important for forming precipitation band(s) in the gel near the cathode. The application of cyclic alternating voltages (particularly, 4 V for 1 h and 1 V for 4 h) was effective in generating Liesegang-band-like periodic bands, particularly for the Cu-Fe PBA system.

A unique method is reported for the syntheses of metal hydroxide carbonate templated Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on carbon cloth and their outstanding water oxidation activities in alkaline medium. The best water oxidation activity is obtained with cobalt hydroxide carbonate templated t-Co-II-Co-III with an overpotential as low as 240 mV to reach a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). It produces constant current over 50 h in chronoamperometric measurements. Moreover, the catalysts outperform the activities of the PBAs prepared without any template and even the noble metal catalyst RuO2.

The effect of pressure on its properties was investigated by X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy. According to XRD results, the sample has a face-centered cubic (Fm-3m) structure. As the pressure increases, the lattice parameters become slightly smaller, but no new high-pressure phase is generated. The results of the Mossbauer spectrum show that as the pressure increases, the singlet of Cu0.64Mn0.86[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot nH(2)O increases, and the doublet decreases.

It was revealed that only require overpotentials of 251 mV to arrive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in OER system, and 90 mV was accomplished at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) toward the HER activity, along with low Tafel slope of 47.6 and 58.7 mV dec(-1) was achieved for OER and HER, respectively. The (Fe-Co)Se-2 catalysts with high electrochemical activity at the same time long-time durability may encourage more practical catalytic applications for renewable energy technologies.

Utilizing Prussian Blue Analogs (PBAs) for adsorption is an effective strategy for cesium removal, yet there is a paucity of research on PBAs-based ionic liquid for enhancing cesium adsorption performance. In this study, a Prussian Blue Analog-based ionic liquid (IPBA) constructed from tetradecyl trimethyl ammonium (TTAB) was introduced and synthesized for the adsorption of cesium. Batch adsorption experiments indicate that the IPBA consistently achieves over 95 % cesium removal across a broad pH spectrum (pH = 2-12), exhibiting excellent stability. The coordination adsorption mechanism of IPBA is confirmed through the use of XPS, FT-IR, and XRD analyses. The incorporation of hydrophobic long chains significantly enhances the selectivity of IPBA for alkali metals, such as potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+), with a cesium removal efficiency of 98.02 % even in the presence of competing ions at certain concentrations. Column adsorption experiments reveal that IPBA can efficiently remove cesium (99.24 %) within 12 h, even at a higher flow rate of 0.56 mL.s(-1). This research offers insights into the design and synthesis of PBAs-based ionic liquid and highlights the potential of ionic liquid in customizing the properties of PBAs for targeted environmental remediation applications.

In this paper, La2O3/Co@N-doped carbon nanotubes (La2O3/Co@NCNTs) composites were synthesized by thermal annealing La[Co(CN)(6)].5H(2)O Prussian blue analogue (LaCo-PBA) precursors under an Argon (Ar) atmosphere. The studies of electromagnetic wave absorption show that La2O3/Co@NCNTs demonstrated the minimum reflection loss (RL) of-53.40 dB with the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 4.34 GHz at the thickness of 2.45 mm. These excellent microwave absorption properties are attributed to multiple loss mechanisms, including conduction loss, polarization loss, magnetic resonance loss, and eddy current loss.

Compared to single ion batteries, aqueous hybrid batteries have been receiving extensive interests in constructing high-performance electrode systems. In this work, we build new Prussian blue analogues-hydrogen gas (PBA-H-2) hybrid battery systems in which PBA-based cathodes operate by different cations (Na+, K+ or NH4+) intercalation chemistry and a hydrogen gas anode operates by electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions. The assembled PBA(Na+)-H-2 hybrid battery delivers an excellent rate performance of 100 C and long cycling lifetime with capacity retention of 92% after 25,000 cycles. In addition, the PBA(K+)-H-2 hybrid battery delivers superior current rate of 100 C and long cycling stability with capacity retention of 88% after 10,000 cycles.

The solidification mechanism is related to FEC polymerization triggered by 5 wt% AlCl3 Lewis acid addition in pristine liquid electrolyte. The SSS electrolyte enables the intrinsic high-reversibility of rhombohedral Prussian blue analogue (r-PBA) cathode, and ultra-long lifetime of 3000 and 4000 cycles at 1 and 2 C, and high rate capacities of 121 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and 88 mAh g(-1) at 10 C are achieved. The improved cyclability and rate capability are ascribed to interface reinforcement between r-PBA and electrolyte due to the protection of formed poly(vinylene carbonate) on r-PBA. This work provides valuable insights into the growing significance of interface stability for rhombohedral structure in Prussian blue analogue.

Comparison of Charge Storage Properties of Prussian Blue Analogues Containing Cobalt and Copper	METALS												Prussian blue analogues are of great interest as alternative battery materials because of their long life cycle and potential use of earth-abundant elements. In this work, thin film mixed-metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) based on NiCo and NiCu alloys were fabricated in an all electrochemical process. The structure and composition of the samples were characterized, along with the charge storage capacity and kinetics of the charge transfer reaction. For both NiCo-HCF and NiCu-HCF samples, the total charge capacity increased with the substitution of Ni with more Co or Cu, and the increase was larger for Cu samples than for Co samples. On the other hand, the charge storage kinetics had only a modest change with substituted metal, and these effects were independent of the amount of that substitution. Thus, the mixed-metal HCFs have promise for increasing overall storage capacity without negatively influencing the rate capability when used in battery applications.

XRD shows that as the preparation temperature increases, [KCoFe] undergoes structural distortion. The room temperature phase and the high temperature phase are both face-centered cubic (Fm-3 m) structures with lattice constants of 10.230 angstrom and 9.980 angstrom, respectively. Mossbauer spectrum analysis showed that due to the increase of synthesis temperature, [KoFe] has undergone charge transfer induced spin transition.

In these contexts, conditions for minimizing dissipative effects are sought in order to obtain long living excitations that can be coherently manipulated. Organic and coordination materials may offer alternative options for their flexibility and low spin-orbit effects. Likewise, ferromagnetic nanostructures provide a versatile platform for hybrid architectures, yet downsizing affects the spin dynamics and needs to be controlled. Here, a systematic investigation on insulating CsNiCr(CN)(6) Prussian blue analogue, including isolated nanoparticles dispersed in polyvinylpyrrolidone, mutually interacting nanoparticles embedded in cetyltrimethylammonium, and bulk samples, is reported. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy is performed in a wide temperature range across the bulk ferromagnetic transition occurring at 90 K. This allows us to monitor key parameters through different types of nanostructured samples. It is found that the Gilbert damping parameter of 10 nm nanoparticles compares well (10(-3)) with values reported for prototypical yttrium iron garnet Y3Fe5O12. Strong coupling with the microwave field of a microstrip resonator is then observed for bulk CsNiCr(CN)(6) as well as for interacting nanoparticles. These results clarify conditions for the coherent manipulation of collective spin degrees of freedom in nanostructured coordination materials.

Herein, we probed the catalytic site of PBNPs for the first time, by comparing their peroxidase-like activity with that of a series of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) in which Fe atoms were replaced by Co, Ni, and Cu. The PBNPs exhibited the highest maximal reaction velocity (1.941 mu M.s(-1)), which was at least 13 times higher than that of the PBAs, demonstrating that the peroxidase-like properties of PBNPs could be ascribed to the FeNx (x = 4-6) instead of the FeC6 units. Notably, the PBNPs/H2O2 couple also showed much higher oxidizability than center dot OH radicals produced from the Fenton reaction, implying that a high active Fe(IV)=O intermediate might be formed in the FeN, units. This study can thus pave the way for the wider application of PBNPs in biomimetic reactions.

J	Xing, JY; Zhang, YS; Jin, Y; Jin, QZ				Xing, Jiangyuan; Zhang, Yongsheng; Jin, Yang; Jin, Qianzheng			Active cation-integration high-entropy Prussian blue analogues cathodes for efficient Zn storage	NANO RESEARCH												Mn-based Prussian blue analogues (Mn-PBAs), featuring a three-dimensional (3D) metal -organic framework and multiple redox couples, have gained wide interests in Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs). However, owing to the Jahn -Teller distortion and disproportionation reaction of Mn3+, these materials suffer from poor electrochemical performances and inferior structural stability. Herein, we prepare a typical high -entropy Prussian blue analogue (HE-PBA) with increased configuration entropy through integrating five transition metal elements of Mn, Co, Ni, Fe and Cu into the nitrogen -coordinated -M- lattice sites. Consequently, the HE-PBA presents enhanced uptake of Zn2+1 with 80 mAh(.)g(-1) compared to those medium -entropy PBAs, low -entropy PBAs and conventional PBAs, which can be assigned to "cocktail" effect of multiple transition metal active redox couples. Furthermore, a phase transition process from monoclinic phase to rhombohedral phase occurs in HE-PBA cathode, resulting in a stable structure of MN6 (M = Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu) and ZnN4 co-linked to FeC6 through the cyanide ligands. Additionally, the advantages of entropy-driven stability are also confirmed by the calculated reduction energy and the density of states between HE-PBA and KMn[Fe(CN)(6)] (KMnHCF). This work not only presents a high-performance HE-PBA cathode in ZIBs, but also introduces a novel concept of high entropy benefiting for designing advanced materials.

Nevertheless, the inferior conductivity of PBAs restricts the application in supercapacitors. In this work, nickel cobalt hexacyanoferrate (Ni2CoHCF) had been produced via a simple co-precipitation approach and coated with polypyrrole on its surface. The conductivity of PBAs was improved by the polypyrrole coating. The Ni2CoHCF@PPy-400 microspheres were demonstrated to the outstanding specific capacity of 82 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). After 3000 cycles, the Ni2CoHCF@PPy-400 microspheres had a long cycle life and 86% specific capacity retention rate at 5 A g(-1). Additionally, it was coupled with activated carbon to build high performance asymmetric supercapacitor (Ni2CoHCF@PPy-400//AC), which displayed a high energy density of 21.7 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 888 W kg(-1) and good cycle stability after 5000 cycles (a capacity retention rate of 85.2%).

However, the available bipolar materials for SABs are limited and their practical scenarios remain scarce. Herein, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) mate-rials with bipolarity are used to construct SABs, by utilizing the two separated redox platforms at cathodes and anodes, respectively. Meanwhile, the phase transition that occurred in the two-charge-transfer process is highly inhibited by dividing the two redox centers into separated charging/discharging processes, leading to a much-improved structural stability of the PBAs electrodes. Consequently, the constructed symmetric cells exhibit an enhanced cyclability with 1500 cycles and the polarity invertible capability which enables longer life and safer operation. Furthermore, various application scenarios have been promoted based on different electrolytes, including fibrous SABs, low-temperature SABs, and seawater SABs. This study reveals a universal strategy of SABs construction using PBAs materials for practical application.

Among the cathode materials used in AZIBs, Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) represent the most promising active materials in view of their improved cyclability and rate performance. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on recent progress on AZIBs obtained using PBAs cathodes with a particular focus on the present understanding of the structure-property correlation of different PBAs, which in turn guides further developments of improved cathode materials and optimization strategies to ensure an extended cyclability and capacity retention.

Here, a unique and facile method is reported for the synthesis of NiFe alloy derived from templated Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on carbon cloth, exhibiting excellent water oxidation activity and stability in alkaline solution. The best water oxidation activity is obtained with O-NiFe@C-600, in which overpotential of 250 mV is required for generating water oxidation current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and overpotential of 300 mV was needed for affording 100 mA cm(-2). In addition, outstanding long-term stability over 25 h in chronoamperometric measurements was achieved for O-NiFe@C-600. The catalysts considerably outperform the activity and stability of the other PBA derived catalysts and even the noble metal catalysts RuO2. The excellent performance is attributable to unique self-supported structures of the PBA-derived NiFe catalysts on carbon cloth as well as the incorporation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by in-situ O-2 plasma activation which further increases the number of active sites for water oxidation. Additionally, well-defined graphitized cells largely enhances stability of the catalyst by acting as chemical protective layers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Herein, we report a creation of unconventional anion (cyano group) and cation (cobalt) bi-vacancies to boost CoFe-PBA for HER through a rapid tannic acid (TA) etching strategy. The combined experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the introduction of bivacancies would be favorable to exposure of accessible active sites, optimizing the electron density of CoFe PBA, and lowering the reaction energy barrier. As a result, the TA-etched CoFe PBA nanocubes supported on nickel foam (NF) (CoFe-PBA@TA/NF) exhibit outstanding HER catalytic activity with an overpotential of only 86 mV at 10 mA cm-2, which is not only significantly lower than bare PBA supported on NF (158 mV), but also comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst.

The manufacturing of the tertiary batteries requires a pre-oxidation step to align and optimize the cathode and anode potentials. The pre-oxidation step, which is not part of the secondary battery manufacturing process, makes the manufacturing of tertiary batteries complex and costly. To omit the pre-oxidation step, we used partially oxidized Prussian blue analogs, i.e., NaxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](y)zH(2)O (Co-PBA) and NaxNi[Fe(CN)(6)](y)zH(2)O (Ni-PBA), as cathode and anode materials. The modified tertiary battery without the pre-oxidation step shows good thermal cyclability between 10 degrees C and 50 degrees C without detectable deterioration of the thermal voltage (V-cell) and discharge capacity ( Q(cell)).					moritomo, yutaka/D-6219-2016	moritomo, yutaka/0000-0001-6584-7489														2313-0105				AUG	2023	9	8							393	10.3390/batteries9080393	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/batteries9080393													WOS:001056285700001

The resultant composites are uniform and tight as demonstrated by SEM and HRTEM images. TiO2/PBA composites exhibit better photoelectrochemical performance than TiO2. Among the TiO2/PBA composites, the composite with TiO2 to PBA molar ratio of 5:1 exhibits the highest photoelectrocatalytic activity with 100 mV of the overpotential diminution, 0.21 V of the flat band potential decrease and 0.39 eV of the band gap reduction.

The swift conversion was confirmed by in-situ Raman micro-spectroscopy under an H-2 gas atmosphere (100 kPa) in a low temperature range (20-90 K). The o-p ratio observed in MCr deviated from the theoretical value based on the Boltzmann distribution of H-2 in a free rotational state to the para-rich proportion, which suggested the promotion of the o-p conversion at higher temperature.

J	Deng, C; Wang, DW				Deng, Chen; Wang, Da-Wei			Functional Electrocatalysts Derived from Prussian Blue and its Analogues for Metal-Air Batteries: Progress and Prospects	BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS												Metal- air batteries holding exceptionally high energy densities have been heavily explored recently amongst the promising next generation energy suppliers. However, their development for real application is restricted mainly due to the sluggish rates of the oxygen- reduction reaction ( ORR) and oxygen- evolution reaction ( OER) in the positive electrode. Thus, searching a facile way to attain highly efficient ORR and OER electrocatalysts are highly desirable. The key factors to improve the electrochemical performance of materials are to optimize their low- dimensional feature and adjust effective compositions. Prussian blue and its analogues ( PB/ PBAs) with open framework have attracted growing attention as hopeful precursors and templates to diverse transition metal- based materials and carbon hybrids for ORR and OER. Compared to other precursors, PB/ PBAs are more feasible for large- scale application due to their easy preparation, low cost, tuneable compositions and great environmental friendliness. In this review, recent progresses in the utilization of PB/ PBA to rationally design and synthesize complex composites with controlled morphologies, sizes, and compositions for ORR, OER and metal- air batteries are described in detail. Afterwards, a brief summary of the synthetic methods to complex transition metal- based compositions with nanostructures converted from PB/ PBAs are provided. Lastly, the research challenges and possible development direction of open framework materials for metal- air batteries are outlined through analysing the merits and drawbacks of using PB/ PBAs as precursors.

As a kind of simple cyano-bridged coordination polymers, Prussian blue (PB) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been considered as the promising cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their 3D open framework, adjustable structure and chemical com-position. Currently, the fundamental research and commercial exploration of PB and PBAs in nonaqueous SIBs are making robust progress. This review summarizes the recent advance and systematical cognition of PB and PBAs, mainly discussing the chemical composition and structure, material synthesis, modifica-tion strategy and sodium storage mechanism in nonaqueous SIBs. The structure-properties relationship of PB and PBAs is deeply revealed from the respects of bulk phase and interfacial stability. Moreover, the issues and perspectives are also analyzed to promote the future scientific research and commercial appli-cation for PB and PBAs cathode in nonaqueous SIBs.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, severe agglomeration of the HEPBA particles still limits the fast charging capabilities. Here, an HEPBA (Na-x(FeMnCoNiCu)[Fe(CN)(6)](y)square(1-y)<middle dot>nH(2)O) with a hollow stair-stepping spherical structure has been prepared through the chemical etching process of the traditional cubic structure of HEPBA. Electrochemical characterization (sodium ion battery), kinetic analysis, and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal that the nature of the high-entropy and the hollow stair-stepping spherical structure can greatly improve the diffusion behavior of Na+ ions. Moreover, the hollow structure effectively mitigates the volume change of HEPBA during SIBs operation, ultimately extending the lifespan. Consequently, the as-prepared HEPBA cathode exhibits excellent rate performance (126.5 and 76.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 4.0 A g(-1), respectively) and stable long-term capability (maintaining its 75.6% capacity after 1000 cycles) due to its unique structure. Furthermore, the waste of the etching process can easily be recycled to prepare more HEPBA product. This processing method holds great promise for designing nanostructures of advanced high-entropy Prussian blue analogues for sodium ion batteries.

One of the typical PBAs, Ni-Co PBA, K0.4Ni2.8 [Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O, was selected to demonstrate the growth process. Silicon substrate surface is functionalized through a typical self-assembled monolayer process using aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) to form relatively robust interface with PBAs through the coordination bonds with the terminal amino-groups of APTMS. Then, these amino-functionalized silicon wafers are used as anchors for the controlled assembly of homogeneous Ni-Co PBA thin films which shows several kinds of pyramidal structures on the surface.

Yet, they suffer from poor electronic conductivity and cycling life. Here, a redox dye polymer, poly(azure C) (PAC), is in-situ grown uniformly on CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFePBA). As a polymer mediator, the PAC coating on each PBA not only enhances the electronic conductivity and surface area, but also improves the structural stability and specific capacitance of PBA. As a result, the optimized CoFePBA@PAC possesses ultrahigh specific capacitance (968.67 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), superior rate performance (665.78 F g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)), and excellent long-cycling stability (92.45% capacity retention after 2000 cycles). As an application, a fabricated CoFePBA@PAC//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (AC = activated carbon) maintains 84.7% capacitance retention in 2000 cycles at 1 A g(-1) and displays a superior specific energy of 29.16 W h kg(-1) at the power density of 799.78 W kg (-1). These results demonstrate that redox dye polymer-coated PBAs with outstanding performance have a promising prospect in the field of energy storage. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study synthesized a NiFe embedded alginate hydrogel (NiFe-AH) via cross-linking with Ni2+. The prepared NiFe-AH exhibited an excellent performance for Cs+ adsorption. The adsorption capacity of NiFe-AH under UV (0.891 mmol/g) or visible light irradiation (0.885 mmol/g) increased approximately 1.5 times more than before light irradiation (0.591 mmol/g). Moreover, the volume and weight of NiFe-AH after Cs+ adsorption decreased substantially, showing advantage in radioactive nuclide disposal. NiFe-AH exhibited high Cs+ adsorption capacity in all pH ranges, even in the presence of competing ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Compared to commercialized Cs+ adsorbents (AMP-PAN and KNiFe-PAN), NiFe-AH proved to have a greater Cs+ adsorption capacity. Analyses using XPS and XANES indicated that the photoinduced enhancement mechanism of Cs+ adsorption on NiFe-AH was attributed to NiFe absorbing the light, resulting in the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) within NiFe. Accordingly, Cs+ ions were additionally adsorbed on NiFe. The NiFe-AH showed exceptional 137Cs removal in seawater, suggesting that it has strong potential as a practical adsorbent.

PBEO hybrid DFT calculations at fixed geometry were carried out on binuclear units of (CN)(5)-M-A-NC-Cr-III-(CN)(5), with M-A = V-II, V-III, and Cr-II. The MMCT transitions occurred at 743 nm for the V-II-Cr-III PBA and at 780 nm for the V-II-Cr-III PBA. The ordering of the transition energy and strength for these analogues agreed with data available in the literature. The transition for the Cr-II-Cr-III MMCT was found to occur at 284 nm. This study shows that TD-DFT is a powerful method to study optical properties of PBAs and that the results for the relatively simple binuclear cluster are comparable to solid PBAs, where MMCT transitions are typically the dominant feature in the visible part of the absorption spectrum.

Nevertheless, their practical implement is significantly blocked by the unsatisfactory energy density due to the limited cathode materials. Herein, vanadium hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue analog (VOHCF) is introduced as a potentially favorable cathode material for APBs. The findings demonstrate that this VOHCF electrode exhibits a notable reversible capacity of 102.7 mAh g-1 and exceptional cycling stability, with 95.4% capacity retention over 10 000 cycles at 10 A g-1. It is noteworthy that this is the detailed instance of VOHCF being proposed as a cathode for APBs. Combining the in situ characterization techniques and theoretical simulations, the origins of excellent proton storage performance are revealed as the multiple redox mechanisms with double active centers of C & EQUIV;N group and VO bond in VOHCF as well as the robust structure stability. A proton full cell with excellent performance is further achieved by coupling the VOHCF cathode and diquinoxalino[2,3-a:2 & PRIME;,3 & PRIME;-c] phenazine (HATN) anode, demonstrating the great potential of VOHCF in practical applications. This work could provide fundamental understanding to the development of feasible cathode materials for proton storage device. The vanadium hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue analog (VOHCF) prepared via one step co-precipitation approach possesses double active sites of traditional C & EQUIV;N group in PBAs and VO bond, which makes full use of the redox activity, favoring the electrochemical performance in aqueous half and full proton batteries in terms of high specific capacity and stability.image					Yan, Chao/AAF-7688-2019; Zheng, Yun/J-1857-2018; Yang, Jun/HKM-5604-2023	Yan, Chao/0000-0002-6008-9452; Yang, Jun/0000-0003-4463-5633; Zhang, Yu/0000-0001-8069-6826													1613-6810	1613-6829				JAN	2024	20	2								10.1002/smll.202305386	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202305386		SEP 2023						37668264					WOS:001058468000001

The conducting mechanism of polyaniline film facilitates small water molecules transforming between benzene structure and quinone structure of polyaniline, which minimizes lattice water content of NiCo-Prussian blue analogues materials. The polyaniline-coated NiCo-Prussian blue analogues are loaded on carbon sponge material to assemble flexible supercapacitors. The specific capacity of 118.2 F g(-1), energy density of 32 Wh kg(-1), and power density of 6.23 kW kg(-1) are obtained on NiCoPBA@PANI-1@CS//AC device, which are much greater than those of NiCoPBA@CS//AC without polyaniline coating.

Today, several techniques are being developed to create electrodes that are at once easy to use, very sensitive, long lasting, and remarkably stable. Here, an eco-friendly solid-state microfabricated copper electrode was constructed using readily available, low-cost copper printed circuit boards, and then a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) thin coating was applied for potentiometric determination of safinamide mesylate (SAF). The surface morphology, crystallinity and chemical structure of the produced PBA thin film were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) respectively. The proposed sensor was effectively implemented for the quantification of SAF in pure and pharmaceutical dosage form. There was no statistically significant difference between the results obtained using the suggested technique and the results obtained using the reported one. Also, green-metrics (including GAPI and the AGREE algorithm, which relies on 12 principles of green analytical chemistry) were used to provide a full evaluation of the investigated method greenness. Finally, the newly announced RGB12 model was used to compare the whiteness degree of the proposed and reported methods.

However, easy aggregation and poor recycling largely limit their practical applications. In this work, spiderweb-like Fe-Co Prussian blue analogue/polyacrylonitrile (FCPBA/PAN) nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning and applied to degrading bisphenol-A (BPA) by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Detailed characterization demonstrated that a high loading of FCPBA (86% of FCPBA in FCPBA/PAN) was successfully fixed on the PAN nanofibers. 67% of BPA was removed within 240 min when 500 mg center dot L-1 PMS and 233 mg center dot L-1 FCPBA/PAN were introduced in 20 mg center dot L-1 BPA solution at initial pH of 2.8. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical inhibition experiments were performed to identify the possible degradation mechanism. For comparison, a low loading of FCPBA nanofibers (0.6FCPBA/PAN nanofibers, 43% of FCPBA in FCPBA/PAN) were also prepared and tested the catalytic performance. The results showed that the activity of FCPBA/PAN was much higher than 0.6FCPBA/PAN. Furthermore, a FCPBA/PAN packed column was made as a reactor to demonstrate the reusability and stability of FCPBA/PAN nanofibers, which also exhibited the bright future for the industrial application. This work makes it possible to fabricate efficient PBA nanocatalysts with excellent recyclability and promotes the application of PBA in industrial areas.

There have been reports of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), silver salts, and Prussian blue (PB) being used for medicinal purposes which are clinically approved. In this context, in the present communication, we incorporated PB and silver salts (silver nitrate) to develop silver PB analogue nanoparticles (SPBANPs), a new nanomedicine formulation as a safer and effective mode of treatment strategy (2-in-1) for both cancer and bacterial infections. Considering all fundamental issues of nanomedicine, along with understanding of the biological impact of PB, we designed a simple, fast, efficient, cheap, and eco-friendly method for the synthesis of [poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)]-stabilized silver hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (silver PB analogue: Ag-3[Fe(CN)(6)] abbreviated as SPBANPs). Various analytical tools were used to analyze and characterize the nanomaterials (SPBANPs). The SPBANPs were highly stable for several weeks in various phosphate buffers with a range of physiological pH conditions (pH = 6-8). The nanoparticles showed biocompatibility in vivo in C57BL6/J mice that encouraged us to screen the nanoparticles for various biomedical applications. The SPBANPs themselves exhibited remarkable inhibition of cancer cell proliferation (B16F10, A549, MCF-7, and SK-OV-3) in vitro. Substantial inhibition of melanoma tumor growth was observed in the C57BL6/J mouse model (aggressive murine melanoma model: B16F10) after intraperitoneal administration of the SPBANPs without any anticancer drug. Additionally, the SPBANPs exhibited excellent antibacterial activity in various Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive ( Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. Interestingly, this nanoformulation itself works as a drug delivery vehicle, as well as an anticancer and antibacterial agent. The in vitro and in vivo results together demonstrate that this biocompatible nanoformulation (SPBANPs) without an anticancer drug or antibiotic could be explored to develop as a multifunctional therapeutic agent (2-in-1) for the treatment of cancer and bacterial infections in the near future.

Further improvements in electrode materials are, however, necessary to achieve a higher efficiency of water desalination. In this work, X-Fe (X = Mn, Co, Cu) Prussian blue analogues of homogeneous particle sizes were grown on electrically conducting activated carbon cloth electrodes by a simple and facile synthesis process. As two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) nano-structured Prussian blue analogue materials present favorable electrochemical behavior and ion-exchange possibilities, they are promising for application in capacitive deionization. The modified carbon cloth electrodes exhibit higher salt adsorption capacity and better charge efficiency compared to those constructed with pristine carbon cloth. Cobalt hexacyanoferrate-modified electrodes show the most stable performance, reaching a salt adsorption capacity of 14.47 mg g(-1) at 1.0 V, accompanied by the lowest energy consumption (0.389 kWh m(-3)). This simple strategy is expected to offer possibilities for designing and synthesizing advanced electrode materials with superior performances for application in capacitive deionization devices.

Here, a controllable selective etching approach is developed for the synthesis of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with enhanced sodium storage activity. On the basis of time dependent experiments, a defect-induced morphological evolution mechanism from nanocube to nanoflower structure is proposed. Through in situ X-ray diffraction measurement and computational analysis, this unique structure is revealed to provide higher Na+ diffusion dynamics and negligible volume change during the sodiation/desodiation processes. As a sodium ion battery cathode, the PBA exhibits a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g(-1), which is in good agreement with the complete low spin Fe-LS(C) redox reaction. It also demonstrates an outstanding rate capability of 71.0 mA h g(-1) at 44.4 C, as well as an unprecedented cycling reversibility over 5000 times.					zhang, lei/LTE-3187-2024; Li, Qi/HJA-7342-2022; Yan, Mengyu/M-1298-2015; Qin, Mingsheng/HLW-4790-2023; Ren, Wenhao/HNR-2923-2023; Mai, Liqiang/B-8299-2014	Yan, Mengyu/0000-0003-1028-0627; zhang, lei/0009-0003-7575-4480; Qin, Mingsheng/0000-0002-8039-2440; Ren, Wenhao/0000-0002-8769-3131; Mai, Liqiang/0000-0003-4259-7725													1530-6984	1530-6992				AUG	2017	17	8					4713	4718		10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b01366	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b01366								28665610					WOS:000407540300024
J	Ivanov, VD				Ivanov, Vladimir D.			Electrochemical properties of (Co,Fe)CN, cobaltous Prussian blue analogue	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY												A Prussian blue analogue (Co,Fe)CN with Fe and Co ions linked by CN- ions was synthesized; the synthesis was aimed at obtaining cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF). However, X-ray phase analysis showed the resemblance of (Co,Fe)CN to sodium iron hexacyanocobaltate (FeHCC) Na0.108Fe[Co(CN)(6)]. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra do not agree with the transition of CoHCF to the latter compound, but do not exclude the possibility of only partial re-coordination of the cyanide ions. At the same time, EPR also excludes formation of the targeted CoHCF. The Fourier transform infrared spectra also indicate that (Co,Fe)CN differs from CoHCF and FeHCC.The (Co,Fe)CN electrochemistry has been studied by cyclic voltammetry. (Co,Fe)CN is electroactive in solutions of alkali metal salts, from Li to Cs, and ammonium salts. The shape of (Co,Fe)CN cyclic voltammograms is unique and does not resemble the curves of CoHCF and FeHCC. It should be noted that the electrode process of CoHCF is blocked in solutions of rubidium, cesium, and ammonium salts, while (Co,Fe)CN is electroactive in these solutions. (Co,Fe)CN produces one pair of peaks in a heavy alkali metal salt solution, whereas in the presence of light alkali metals, it produces two to three pairs of peaks. Electrochemical data also reveal the difference between (Co,Fe)CN and CoHCF and are one more argument in favor of the partial CN- ion linkage isomerization. Unfortunately, all the evidence for the re-coordination of cyanide ions gained in this work is only indirect.

The Na2WO4 coating will not alter the structure and morphology of PBA sample. Na2WO4 coating improves the structure stability and Li+ insertion/extraction reversibility, and decreases the charge transfer resistance, then promotes the transfer of Li+.

In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber sponge with dimethyloxaloglycine (DMOG) loaded mesoporous spheres of derivatives of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) was prepared (3D-PBA(FeCo)-DMOG). The nanostructure, composition, and mechanical properties of 3D-PBA(FeCo)-DMOG were characterized, showing regular nanostructure and good mechanical property. The behavior of in vitro drug release showed the DMOG could achieve long-term and stable release by encapsulating in PBA(FeCo) microspheres and nanofibers. In vitro coagulation experiments showed that 3D-PBA(FeCo)-DMOG had effective hemostasis and clotting capacities. In addition, the antioxidant capacity and cell compatibility of 3D-PBA(FeCo)-DMOG were confirmed.

Because of the possibilities to explore many analogous materials with engineered, defect-rich environments, computational optimization of ion-transport mechanisms that are key to the device performance could facilitate real-world applications. In this work, we have applied a multiscale approach involving quantum chemistry, self-consistent mean-field theory, and finite-element modeling to investigate ion transport in PBAs. We identify a cyanide-mediated ladder mechanism as the primary process of ion transport. Defects are found to be impermissible to diffusion, and a random distribution model accurately predicts the impact of defect concentrations. Notably, the inclusion of intermediary local minima in the models is key for predicting a realistic diffusion constant. Furthermore, the intermediary landscape is found to be an essential difference between both the intercalating species and the type of cation doping in PBAs. We also show that the ladder mechanism, when employed in multiscale computations, properly predicts the macroscopic charging performance based on atomistic results. In conclusion, the findings in this work may suggest the guiding principles for the design of new and effective PBAs for different applications.

Luminol can be oxidized under alkaline conditions without adding other oxidants. The chemiluminescence (CL) intensity produced is more than 1000 times that of the original luminol-NaOH system. Thus, a novel luminolNaOH-CuFe PBA CL sensor was constructed. The CL intensity of the system would drastically decrease with the addition of uric acid (UA), it served as the foundation for the creation of an enzyme-free CL sensor for the determination of UA. The CL signal intensity of the system showed a linear connection with the square of the UA concentration in the range of 0.25 to 0.45 mmol center dot L-1, and the limits of detection was 0.10 mmol center dot L-1.

Electroactive Prussian Blue Analogues/TiO2 Nanocomposites Obtained through SILAR Assembly in Mesoporous Nanoarchitectures	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY												The preparation of nanomaterials for energy applications such as intercalation batteries and materials that can act as substrates for water oxidation is a subject of major interest nowadays. In this work, we report the deposition of Prussian blue (PB) and its cobalt analogue (CoPBA) on mesoporous titania thin films (MTTF) using the successive ionic layer adsorption reaction (SILAR) technique under soft conditions. A bifunctional ligand, 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (pd), was used to functionalize the titania surface and promote the growth of PB and CoPBA. The resulting PB@MTTF and CoPBA@MTTF nanocomposites were characterized using several techniques and it was determined that PB and CoPBA grow in a controlled and sequential manner, maintaining the mesoporous architecture. Both PB@MTTF and CoPBA@MTTF demonstrated very good electroactive properties, while CoPBA@MTTF exhibited water oxidation capabilities. The flexibility of this PBA@MTTF platform allows the incorporation of any labile transition metal ion or fragment into the structure of the coordination polymer embedded into a mesoporous matrix, opening the door for (photo)electrochemical devices and catalysts.

CoSe2 nanoboxes (NBs) were synthesized successfully using Co-Prussian blue analogue (PBA) metal organic framework (MOF) as a template. Co-PBA NBs were obtained by etching the cube-shaped crystals of Co-PBA with ammonia. Subsequent selenization of Co-PBA NBs afforded CoSe2 NBs. Due to the hollow and conductive nature, the CoSe2 NBs provided excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In 1 M KOH aqueous solution, CoSe2 NBs delivered overpotential of 335 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slop of 54.2 mV dec(-1), and good cycling stability, suggesting possibility of being used as a electrochemical catalyst for alkaline fuel cells.

The Ni-Co PBA HNCs exhibit an enhanced catalytic activity towards glucose oxidation. The three-dimensional Ni-Co PBA IINCs modified electrode form a novel glucose sensor which not involved the enzyme. The properties of glucose sensor based on Ni-Co PBA HNCs are explored by electrochemical technique, for instance, cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential impulse voltammetry (DPV) and typical amperometric-time method (i-t). As compared to pure Ni PBA HNCs and pure Co PBA HNCA, the Ni-Co PBA HNCs exhibit outstanding catalytic performance for electro-oxidation of glucose. The bimetal synergetic catalyst of Ni and Co in the Ni-Co PBA HNCs causes this sensor with superior oxidation capacity for glucose. The analysis of the experimental data prove that this glucose sensor based on Ni-Co PBA HNCs possesses wide linear range: 0.002 mM - 3.79 mM, low detection limit: 1.2 mu M (S/N = 3), high sensitivity: 149 mu A.mM(-1).cm(-2), as well as good selectivity.

F.; Han, Yupei; Celorrio, Veronica; Sankar, Gopinathan; Zhou, Min; Xu, Yang			Anion Vacancy Regulated Sodium/Potassium Intercalation in Potassium Prussian Blue Analog Cathodes for Hybrid Sodium-Ion Batteries	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												Fe-based potassium Prussian blue analogs (K-PBAs) are commonly used as K-ion battery (KIB) cathodes. Interestingly, K-PBAs are appealing cathodes for Na-ion batteries (NIBs). In a hybrid NIB cell, where Na-ion is in the electrolyte and K-ion is in the PBA cathode, cation intercalation and electrochemical performance of the cathode can be significantly affected by [Fe(CN)6]4- anion vacancy. This work studies the effect of anion vacancy in K-PBAs on regulating K-ion/Na-ion intercalation mechanism in hybrid NIB cells, by comparing two K-PBA cathodes with different vacancy contents. The results demonstrate that introducing a level of anion vacancy can maximize the number of K-ion intercalation sites and enhance K-ion diffusion in the PBA framework. This facilitates K-ion intercalation and suppresses Na-ion intercalation, resulting in a K-ion-dominated and high-discharge-voltage ion storage process in the hybrid NIB cell. The K-PBA cathode with 20% anion vacancy delivers 128 mAh g-1 at 25 mA g-1 and 67 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1, as well as retains 89% and 81% capacity after 100 and 300 cycles, respectively. It completely outperforms the counterpart with 7% anion vacancy, which exhibits increased Na-ion intercalation but overall deteriorated ion storage. Fe-based Prussian blue analogs exhibit enhanced K-ion intercalation and suppressed Na-ion intercalation in the presence of anion vacancies in the structure. When K-containing Prussian blue analogs are used as cathodes in hybrid Na-ion batteries, the enhancement results in an increase in discharge voltage, reversible capacity, and rate capability, compared to Na-containing counterparts.image					Han, YuPei/IAP-5219-2023; Zhou, Min/H-4082-2013; Xu, Yang/C-2266-2012; He, Pan/A-7259-2018; Celorrio, Veronica/AAG-1427-2021	Xu, Yang/0000-0003-0177-6348; Zhou, Min/0000-0003-2677-5472; He, Pan/0000-0001-7150-6859; Zhai, Xingwu/0000-0002-3591-7957; Celorrio, Veronica/0000-0002-2818-3844													1616-301X	1616-3028				DEC	2023	33	52								10.1002/adfm.202308227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202308227		SEP 2023											WOS:001119185200001

In this study, a g-C3N4/Prussian-blue analogue (PBA)/Nickel foam (NF) with hierarchical micro/nano structures was developed by a simple salts-directed self-assembly approach. In this synthetic strategy, NF acted as both 3D macroporous conductive substrate and Ni source for PBA formation. Moreover, the incidental salt in molten salt-synthesized g-C3N4 nanosheets could regulate the combination mode between g-C3N4 and PBA to generate interactive networks of g-C3N4 nanosheets-covered PBA nanoprotuberances on NF surfaces, which further expended the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Based on the merits from this unique hierarchical structure and the synergy effect of PBA and g-C3N4, the optimized g-C3N4/ PBA/NF electrode exhibited a maximum areal capacitance of 3366 mF cm-2 at current of 2 mA cm-2, as well as 2118 mF cm-2 even under large current of 20 mA cm-2. The solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor using g-C3N4/ PBA/NF electrode possessed an extended working potential window of 1.8 V, prominent energy density of 0.195 mWh cm-2 and power density of 27.06 mW cm-2. Compared to the device with pure NiFe-PBA electrode, a better cyclic stability with capacitance retention rate of 80% after 5000 cycles was also achieved due to the protective effect of g-C3N4 shells on the etching of PBA nano-protuberances in electrolyte. This work not only builds a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, but also provide an effective way to apply molten salt -synthesized g-C3N4 nanosheet without purification.

However, the unstable structure during charging/discharging process and the poor cycle life hinder its commercial application. In this work, potassium ions stabilized hollow Mn-based Prussian blue analogue is synthesized through a simple sodium citrate assisted method using for cathode of sodium-ions batteries. Although unique hollow structure could suffer volume variation during charging/discharging process, the K+ is introduced to further stabilize its structure. The PBAs cathode exhibits a high reversible specific capacity of 128 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA and superior rate performance of 72 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 3200 mA g(-1), which is attributed to its stable structure and enhanced sodium ions transport kinetics. Ex-situ XRD/Raman tests and electrochemical measurements further prove the synergistic effect of various alkali ions (K+/Na+) and unique hollow structure.

A major challenge with iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCFe), particularly in lithium-ion systems, is its slow kinetics in organic electrolytes and valence state inactivation in aqueous ones. We have addressed these issues by developing a polymeric cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer through a ring-opening reaction of ethylene carbonate triggered by OH- radicals from structural water. This facile approach considerably mitigates the sluggish electrochemical kinetics typically observed in organic electrolytes. As a result, FeHCFe has achieved a specific capacity of 125 mAh g(-1) with a stable lifetime over 500 cycles, thanks to the effective activation of Fe low-spin states and the structural integrity of the CEI layers. These advancements shed light on the potential of PBAs to be viable, durable, and efficient cathode materials for commercial use.

One promising approach is electrically driven desalination using intercalation electrodes. While intercalation electrodes have been widely researched for energy storage applications, only a small subset of those materials is suitable for desalination. Here we report the synthesis, characterization, and in-device testing of three Prussian blue analogue intercalation compounds: copper, manganese, and zinc hexacyanoferrate with formulas KxM[Fe(CN)(6)]z center dot nH(2)O (M = Cu, Mn, Zn). The desalination performance for each of these materials against carbon electrodes is reported for Na+ intercalation and for Ca2+ intercalation using 1000 ppm NaCl and 1000 ppm CaCl2 feed solutions, respectively. While the copper and manganese analogs showed promising performance for Na+ and Ca2+ intercalation, the zinc compound was unstable and underwent rapid dissolution.

Olof			Observation of excited state absorption in the V-Cr Prussian blue analogue	CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS												We present femtosecond transient transmission measurements of thin films of the V-II/III-Cr-III Prussian blue analogue (V-Cr PBA) in the spectral range 330-675 nm after exciting the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition (LMCT) at 400 nm. A global analysis including three decay-times of tau(1) = 230 fs, tau(2) = 1.38 ps and tau(3) >> 2 ns could satisfactory describe the data. We observed an excited state absorption (ESA) at 345 nm, which was attributed to a charge-transfer transition from the E-2 state on the Cr ions after fast intersystem crossing from the quartet manifold. An additional weak and short-lived ESA at 455 nm was also observed and was tentatively attributed to the initially populated (LMCT)-L-4 state. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the intrinsically sluggish reaction rate of UOR restircts its application. It is urgent to prepare advanced electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and durability. Herein, we report a bimetallic oxide catalyst Fe3O4-NiO/NF with porous nanostructure derived from Prussian blue analogue. The prepared catalyst has a high BET surface area (79 m(2) g(-1)) and mesoporous structure. Fe3O4-NiO/NF has remarkable UOR activity compared with NiFe(CN)(6)/NF, the required potential for Fe3O4-NiO/NF decreased from 1.5 to 1.44 V to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope decreased from 38.7 to 32.5 mV dec(-1). The advanced porous nanostructure and abundant redox couple of Ni3+/Ni(2+)and Fe3+/Fe(2+)make Fe3O4-NiO/NF to be a promising UOR catalyst. This study provides a universal optimization strategy of structure and composition for designing advanced UOR electrocatalysts.

However, the cycling stabilities of these materials remain unsatisfactory because their structural deformation induces ion intercalation. In this study, a PVP assisted Mn-Co-PBA was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method. Mn-Co-PBA displays unique cubic frame-like structures with a high specific surface area and fewer zeolitic water molecules in the host lattice. The Mn-Co-PBA||Zn cell displayed an excellent specific capacity of 138 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, good rate capability (95 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1), and good cycling stability (capacity retention of 92.8% after 1000 cycles) because of its unique cubic frame structure. This structure can provide a greater number of Zn diffusion pathways and alleviate the structural strain during Zn2+ ion insertion/extraction processes. An ex-situ XRD analysis revealed that the de/intercalation of Zn2+ ions in the Mn-Co-PBA electrodes was highly reversible. These results show that Mn-Co-PBA holds great promise for advancement in the field of AZIBs and contributes to the realization of effective and sustainable battery technologies.

J	Cao, LM; Lu, D; Zhong, DC; Lu, TB				Cao, Li-Ming; Lu, David; Zhong, Di-Chang; Lu, Tong-Bu			Prussian blue analogues and their derived nanomaterials for electrocatalytic water splitting	COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS												The electrocatalytic water splitting is considered as a prospect meaning to address the urgent energy and environmental problems. However, the electrocatalytic water splitting is greatly limited by the high over-potentials of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Especially, OER involves a complex multistep proton-coupled electron transfer process, which demands a high overpotential to accelerate this sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics. The high overpotentials for OER significantly decrease the efficiency of the overall water splitting. The OER half reaction has thus become the bottleneck of electrocatalytic overall water splitting. It is vital to synthesize highly active electrocatalysts to reduce the activation energy of the reaction and accelerate the generation of H-2 and O-2, thereby improving the efficiency of the overall water splitting. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are representative cyanide-based coordination polymer materials. PBAs possess open framework structures, large specific surface areas, adjustable metal active sites and uniform catalytic centers, showing promising application in electrocatalytic water splitting. Besides, benefiting from the unique structural features of PBAs, their derived electrocatalysts also have large specific surface areas and uniform active sites. Moreover, PBAs can serve as carbon and nitrogen sources. The doped N can regulate the electronic structure of surface active sites, enhancing the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts. Therefore, the PBA-derived electrocatalysts also exhibit good catalytic performance for water splitting. In this review, we not only summarize the most recent advances on PBAs and their derivatives as electrocatalysts for water splitting, but also conclude the core scientific challenges faced in water splitting. Finally, we provide perspectives for the future research in this field, including catalyst design, catalytic system establishment and so on. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is still a huge challenge to avoid obvious capacity decay during cycling due to the structural collapse. Herein, we design a method to replace parts of Fe ion sites in PB with Ni ions to prepare fluffy-like nickel PB (PB-Ni) by cationic solution immersion, which improves cycling stability for sodium storage. The content of Ni in PB-Ni is explored by regulating the soaking time in the Ni-containing solution, which results in different effects on the electrochemical performance as cathodes of SIBs. Especially, PB-Ni-1d (soaking in NiCl2 solution for 1 day) exhibits an initial capacity of 114.2 mA h g(-1 ) at 50 mA g(-1) and a stable cycling performance of 800 cycles at 300 mA g(-1). Furthermore, the reversible phase transformation and small volume variation for PB-Ni-1d are revealed by in situ X-ray diffraction characterization. The nickel hexacyanoferrate in outer layer maintains the cubic phase to stabilize the crystal structure. The cation-exchange strategy provides a facile idea to fabricate high-quality PB cathodes with superior stability for high-performance SIBs.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-modified Co-Co PBA nanocubes (PBA-AuNPs) worked as a support of the antibody (Ab2) of PrPc to obtain Ab2-PBA-AuNPs composite and also as the signal source for PrPc assay. When PrPc existed, Ab2-PBA-AuNPs could be introduced to the surface of another antibody of PrPc (Ab1) modified AuNPs/GC electrode (the gold nanoparticles-modified glassy carbon electrode) through specific antigen-antibody interaction between PrPc and its antibodies to form the Ab1-PrPc-Ab2 sandwich structure. With the help of KOH aqueous solution, PBA generated a large DPV response. The response peak currents were linear with the logarithmic values of the concentration of PrPc in the range from 0.075 pg mL(-1) to 100 pg mL(-1) with the detection limit of 0.014 pg mL(-1). Also, the immunosensor showed good selectivity and reproducibility. Based on the simple sensing structure and good analytical performance, the developed immunosensor may have promising applications in practical assay of infectious isoform of prion (PrPsc) and other proteins by simply changing the related antibody.

The Fe-Ni5P4/NF dual electrode just need a minimal cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and maintain operational stability for a minimum of 50 h, demonstrating outstanding bifunctional properties.

Challenges are still existed to meet the rigid requirements of high power and long cycle life. In this work, we develop a universal metal-organic-framework templating strategy for fabricating hollow polyhedrons of prussian blue analogues with tailored composition and shape. Hollow dodecahedrons of cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) are investigated as a proof-of-concept material, which shows high surface area and mesoporous characteristics. The CoHCF hollow dodecahedrons exhibit large Na+ storage capacity in neutral aqueous electrolytes and particularly, superhigh rate capability owing to rapid ion diffusion rate and short carrier transport distances. By coupling with a low-cost carbon anode, hybrid Na-ion cells are constructed to deliver moderate specific energy (32.7-50 Wh kg(-1)), a high specific power of 30 kW kg(-1), and superior 3000-cycling durability. The excellent electrochemical properties make the present aqueous Na-ion hybrid devices to be a promising alternative to lead-acid batteries for high power grid-scale energy storage.

The as-derived FeSe-NiSe/NF electrode with unique interpenetrated porous three-dimensional (3D) network architecture successfully combines the desired merits including high conductivity and a large specific surface area. As a result, it exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic OER performance in alkaline media, which requires overpotentials of only 234 and 268 mV to deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, outclassing its counterpart NiSe/NF.

This may somewhat hinder its full application in energy storage. Herein, for the first time, a yolk-shell K0.86Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.74)center dot 2.35H(2)O microboxes with self-assembled hierarchical subunits are synthesized through a facile one-step approach. This growth process utilizes the self-assembly driving force of poly-vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) to motivate the consumption of the interior bulky crystal to outward rearrangement, and meanwhile preserving the outer shell. By virtue of the flexible reaction time, controllable structures with specific surface area and pore size can be realized. As a cathode for lithium ion battery it exhibits a high specific capacity of over 160 mAh g(-1) and excellent rate performance, owing to the tailored high specific surface area yolk-shell structures. The nanostructured shell and the porous voids provide large active surface to build up the electrolyte/electrode interface and enable fast kinetics for reversible Li+ insertion and removal.

Na0.54Co1.23[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot 7.6H(2)O was prepared by the co-precipitation method and pressurized at 1-40 MPa using a supercritical CO2 extraction unit. All materials are face-centered cubic with a Neel temperature of about 14 K. The results showed that two electronic configurations existed in the NaCoFe-PBA system at room temperature: Fe-LS(III)-CN-Co-HS(II) and Fe-LS(II)-CN-Co-LS(III). The pressure induced the enhancement of antiferromagnetic coupling between Co-Fe ions and controlled the interconversion of the two structures through charge transfer mediated by cyanide bridges. We found that the directions of redox reactions occurring at 0-20 MPa and 20-40 MPa did not coincide, suggesting that there may be more complex interactions between structural and electronic events.

However, controllable synthesis of high-performance PBAs for aqueous batteries remains a challenging task due to the presence of unavoidable crystal defects, coordinated water, metal ion dissolution, and a stable window of limited aqueous solution. To address these challenges and achieve practical applications, significant efforts made and some key progress have been made. The structure and electrochemical behavior of PBA, such as electronic transfer, ion transport, ion diffusion, and material phase transitions, are extensively discussed. In addition, on the basis of a comprehensive introduction to the many challenges faced by the use of PBAs in aqueous batteries, we systematically summarized the synthesis routes of PBAs and modification strategies, such as acid/base chemical etching, inorganic/organic compound, transition metal doping. Finally, an insight into the future research directions and further development prospects of PBAs-based materials are proposed so as to facilitate the extensive application in the filelds of aqueous batteries. This review provides significant comprehension for construction and optimization of high-performance PBAs-based materials used in aqueous batteries.					wang, pengfei/ABD-7479-2021; Yi, Ting-Feng/F-4594-2012; He, Yanbing/AFQ-3143-2022	Wang, Peng-Fei/0000-0001-5305-8167													0010-8545	1873-3840				JUL 1	2024	510								215833	10.1016/j.ccr.2024.215833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2024.215833		APR 2024											WOS:001288150400001

Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals driven by solar energy is conceivable for solving the above problem. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a class of organic-inorganic hybrid materials have considerable prospect for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) photocatalysis. Nevertheless, most MOFs in the CO2RR still have limited photocatalytic performance as well as selectivity caused by having a single metal and face the challenge of instability. Herein, 10 Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as heterogeneous catalysts were directly employed for the photocatalytic CO2RR, which exhibit good photocatalytic performance for CO production. A mass evolution rate of 140 mmol g(-1) h(-1), an apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of about 0.7%, and a selectivity of about 96.8% for CO were obtained over Ni-Co PBA. Notably, the CO2RR activities of (MCo)-Co-II PBAs are better than those of M-II-Fe PBAs, but the former's selectivities for CO are lower than those of the latter. The divergence of activity is dependent on their electron transfer rates, which is confirmed by the electrochemical experiments and spectral characterization. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) as well as H-2 adsorption and desorption experiments of the PBAs reveal the difference in selectivity.

Herein, we present the synthesis of nickel hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue analogues via anodic polarization for efficient alkaline seawater oxidation (ASO). Electrochemical experiments and in situ Raman studies unveil that leaching of Fe(CN)(6)(3-) from the electrode facilitates a dynamic self-reconstruction process and leads to the formation of high-valence metal reaction specie, and appropriate Fe(CN)(6)(3-) effectively shields active sites from Cl interference even at ampere-level current density (j). In experiments, our electrode demonstrates an overpotential of merely 349 mV to reach a j of 1 A cm(-2) and maintains stable operation for over 1000 h with protective Fe(CN)(6)(3-) . This work showcases the potential of Prussian blue analogues for efficient and long-lasting ASO, protecting against Cl- in large-scale seawater H-2 electrolysis.

It is well known that 1D hollow structure is especially attractive for electrochemical sensor due to its special advantages, but it is also an extremely difficult project for PBA because of their classic cubic morphology. Herein, we adopted a two-step synthetic strategy, realizing the successful fabrication of NiFePBA one-dimensional hollow tubes on the surface of nickel foam (NF) as conductive substrate. A series of testing results have demonstrated that as-prepared 1D hollow nanotubes exhibit excellent electrochemical sensing performance towards glucose, including fast response speed of 0.1 s, wide detection range of 2-650 mu M, very high sensitivity up to 21.04 mA mM-1 cm-2, and low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2 mu M (S/N = 3). In a word, this work provides excellent electrochemical sensor materials towards glucose, more importantly, it develops a novel and general strategy to construct 1D hollow structure for further application.

In this study, a straightforward strategy was proposed for synthesizing ultra-thin oxygen-rich graphitized carbon nanosheets (denoted as GCS-O). These nanosheets are obtained by calcining a topologically two-dimensional indium-based coordination polymer. Subsequently, the growth of FeNi Prussian blue analogue (PBA) on GCS-O effectively introduces active sites and increases the nitrogen content within the carbonaceous matrix. The resulting FeNi-PBA/GCS-O composite exhibits excellent glucose sensing performance with a broad linear range of 1 to 1300 mu mol<middle dot>L-1. Meanwhile, it also achieves a high sensitivity of 2496 mu A<middle dot>mmol(-1)<middle dot>L<middle dot>cm(-2), a limit of detection of 100 nmol<middle dot>L-1 (S/N = 3), and commendable long-term durability. The relatively simple synthesis process, exceptional sensitivity, and satisfactory electrochemical sensing performance of FeNi-PBA/GCS-O open up new directions for biosensor applications.

Iron-based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are considered as potential cathodes owing to their rigid open framework, low-cost, and simple synthesis. However, it is still a challenge to increase the sodium content in the structure of PBAs and thus suppress the generation of defects in the structure. Herein, a series of isostructural PBAs samples are synthesized and the isostructural evolution of PBAs from cubic to monoclinic after modifying the conditions is witnessed. Accompanied by, the increased sodium content and crystallinity are discovered in PBAs structure. The as-obtained sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (Na1.75Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.9743)& BULL;2.76H(2)O) exhibits high charge capacity of 150 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (17 mA g(-1)) and excellent rate performance (74 mAh g(-1) at 50 C (8500 mA g(-1))). Moreover, their highly reversible Na+ ions intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism is verified by in situ Raman and Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) techniques. More importantly, the Na1.75Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.9743)& BULL;2.76H(2)O sample can be directly assembled in a full cell with hard carbon (HC) anode and shows excellent electrochemical performances. Finally, the relationship between PBAs structure and electrochemical performance is summarized and prospected.

However, the problem of capacity degradation caused by phase transitions during the charge/discharge process has so far limited the applicability of PBAs. While the high entropy strategy can alleviate capacity decay induced by phase transitions, challenges such as low conductivity, material aggregation, and severe interface reactions between electrode materials and electrolytes still persist. Therefore, we used a simple and scalable one-step coprecipitation method to grow high entropy Prussian blue analogues (HEPBA) on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to address these problems. The rGO not only inhibits material agglomeration but also separates the electrolyte from the electrode material to prevent severe interface reactions. Meanwhile, the Warburg impedance is reduced and the Na+ diffusion performance is improved. When high entropy Prussian blue grown on an rGO matrix (HEPBA@rGO) is utilized as the cathode in a half-cell, it exhibits high discharge specific capacity (115.2 mAh g- 1 at 100 mA g- 1), long cycling stability (retaining 84.6 mAh g- 1 after 1000 cycles), and good rate capability (62 mAh g- 1 at 15 C).

However, those were practically impossible to use in alkaline solution and seawater, due to the low stabilization of PBAs in alkaline solution and quickly decompose to create toxic cyanide contamination. In this research, potassium zinc hexacyanoferrate (PZH), one kind of PBAs was chosen, and the stability of PZH in the alkaline solution was remedied by incorporating magnetic rectorite (MR) and evaluated by XRD, XPS and cyanide analysis. Effect of pH value and the water systems on the crystalline and chemical stability were studied. The adsorption performance for Cs+ in high pH solution and the biological toxicity of the PZH/MR composite were also evaluated. The composite material exhibits significant adsorption capacity for Cs+ ions (215.128 mg/g, 293 K, increased over 20% than pristine PZH) and low cytotoxicity in human hepatic cells (HepG2 cells), indicating its potential application Cs+ adsorption in waste-water and Cs+ decorporation from body. The stability and safety mechanism in a wide pH range (from 2 to 11) were explained. The stabilization method on PBAs is an advanced yet and effective feasible mean with applications for internal and external cesium remediation. This research opens up a wide range of novel applications for PB-based adsorbents or decorporation, particularly in the field of the cesium remediation in high pH value. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Prussian blue analog (PBA) with rapid charge transfer channels has shown significant potential as high-rate NIB cathodes; however, the fast-charging capability of reported PBA-based anodes remains limited. This challenge primarily stems from the complete transformation of their original PBA-based crystal structures during synthesis processes, resulting in loss of the inherent rapid charge transfer channels. Herein, a Ni-Fe based PBA (Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2) with a representative PBA-based crystal structure is presented as a prototype to investigate its potential as a NIB anode, and structural modification strategies are implemented to unlock its rapid Na-ion storage. First, conversion reaction mechanism is demonstrated in the Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2 during sodiation, with a theoretical specific capacity of 357.2 mAh g-1. However, its reversible capacities after long-term cycling and at high rates are low. To address these issues, structural optimization strategies including S incorporation, configurational entropy modulation, and coordination environment regulation are utilized. Consequently, its fast-charging (approximate to 40 s per charge with 245.0 mAh g-1 input) and excellent cycling capabilities are realized. This study demonstrates the feasibility of PBA as high-rate NIB anodes, and promotes the further investigation into structural optimization strategies aimed at developing other fast-charging electrodes.

The catalytic activity of PBAs relies on exposed crystal facets and accessible active sites on the PBA framework. Employing a heteroatom doping strategy using a rare earth element (La), we regulated the crystal structure and optimized the catalytic activity of CoFe PBA for peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-driven degradation of the antibiotic norfloxacin (NOR). The La atoms were mainly doped in the interstitial sites of the CoFe PBA cubic lattices, without affecting the electron distributions of Co and Fe metals or the face-centered cubic crystal phase of the coordination skeleton. La doping dominated the (1 1 1) and (100) as the main exposed facets of CoFeLa PBA, increasing the affinity of CoFeLa PBAs for PMS adsorption due to the higher surface energy of the two facets. Consequently, the activation energy considerably declined from 77.57 kJ/mol in CoFe PBA to 51.66 kJ/mol in CoFeLa PBA and the catalytic activity for PMS-driven NOR degradation was largely improved, which can reach 76.4 % removal of NOR within 15 min, with an increased initial rate constant k of 0.095 min-1. 1O2 was proven as the main reactive specie responsible for NOR degradation in the PMS/CoFeLa system, and O2 center dot- and SO4 center dot- were verified as the important intermediates to generate 1O2. Thus, La doping can effectively enhance the catalytic performance of PBA-based catalysts for organic pollutant removal.

As a result, the obtained electrocatalyst exhibited excellent HER performance with an overpotential of only 85 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH, and showed outstanding stability due to the protection of the carbon shell.

However, their limited conductivity and electron transfer inefficiency hinder practical applications. This study utilizes a simple one-pot synthesis approach to produce a tungsten-disulfide (WS 2 ) and iron-cobalt Prussian blue analogue composite (WS 2 -PBA), enhancing conductivity and electron transfer rate performance. Through the inclusion of sodium citrate into the solution, the S-edge site concentration of WS 2 increases. This augmentation introduces additional active sites and defects into the catalyst, enhancing its catalytic activity. The effectiveness of the WS 2 -PBA 3D-Origami paper device for lactate detection in sweat is also evaluated for biomedical applications. The device demonstrated a robust relationship between the lactate concentration and current intensity (R 2 = 0.997), with a detection limit of 1.83 mM. Additionally, this platform has successfully detected lactate in clinical sweat, correlating with the high-performance liquid chromatography test results, suggesting promising prospects for clinical diagnosis.

Here, we report a straightforward one-step strategy to construct hollow bimetallic CoFe-PBA. The morphology evolution process is carefully investigated as a function of aging time and relative reactant ratio, proving that the Co2+-to-[Fe(CN)(6)](3-) (Co/Fe) ratio is crucial for obtaining the hollow structure, which is revealed as an orientated dissolution- recrystallization process driven by supersaturation. The hollow CoFe-PBA acts as an ideal precursor for the derived synthesis of ternary Co-Fe-P, which provides promising performance for the oxygen evolution reaction, with a low eta(10) = 235 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode and a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1). This study proposes a new method for the design and construction of hollow PBAs for further conversion into highly efficient catalyst materials.

In this work, we proposed a rapid and scalable synthesis route for fabricating Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes with tunable compositions and uniform particle size. With the structural benefits of abundant surface sites, facile charge transfer behavior and favorable Co2+-to-Co3+ pre-oxidation reaction, fast generation and accumulation of the catalytically active Co3+ sites can be achieved for the CoCo PBA nanocubes, leading to remarkable OER activity with simultaneously achieved low overpotential, large anodic current density, small Tafel slope as well as outstanding intrinsic activity. Of note, by performing long-term OER operation, the CoCo PBA nanocubes exhibit a remarkable 5.5-folds performance enhancement, and obvious surface reconstruction and the accumulation of high-valence Co species can be identified, proving the crucial role of pre-oxidation process in boosting the OER catalysis. This work proposed a universal approach for the rapid, scalable and controllable fabrication of the PBA-based materials, and the elucidation of the pre-oxidation process in facilitating the OER catalysis may provide useful guidance for designing and optimizing advanced catalysts for energy-related electro-oxidation reactions in the future.					sun, wenbin/V-1001-2019; Xie, Yi/B-5753-2009; Xie, Junfeng/A-9215-2010	Xie, Junfeng/0000-0002-5775-3084													1001-604X	1614-7065				SEP	2021	39	9					2347	2353		10.1002/cjoc.202100294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cjoc.202100294		JUL 2021											WOS:000668845600001

However, the development of PBAs-based rubidium adsorbents with excellent stability and adsorption capacity is still hindered by the inevitable CN ligand vacancies. Herein, a synthetic strategy is proposed to slow down crystal nucleation and promote the self-repair of crystal defects by incorporating N-doped porous carbon (NPC) as a solid modifier during the synthesis process. As a result, the vacancy content of Zn-PBA-NPC is significantly decreased and large size twinned crystals are produced, which remarkably improves the thermal and acid-base stability. Benefiting from the high content of K+ in the low-vacancy Zn-PBANPC, it achieves a high adsorption amount of 199.1 mg g- 1 and rapid adsorption kinetics of just 5 min for Rb+. In addition, it shows good selectivity in the presence of other alkali metal ions. This work not only prepares a highperformance adsorbent for efficient recovery of Rb+, but also facilitates insights into the design and construction of low-vacancy PBAs.																			1383-5866	1873-3794				JUN 22	2025	359		3						130842	10.1016/j.seppur.2024.130842	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.130842		DEC 2024											WOS:001373527500001
J	Zhang, YY; Jin, F; Liu, H; Jin, ZL				Zhang, Yueyang; Jin, Fei; Liu, Hai; Jin, Zhiliang			In-situ XPS monitoring bimetallic Prussian blue analogs and metal oxides heterojunction for photocatalytic hydrogen production	FUEL												Here, the binary catalyst NiFe PBA@Cu2O with p-n heterojunction is successfully constructed by coupling metal Prussian blue analogs (NiFe-Prussian blue analog) with metal oxide (Cu2O). As a demonstration case, the NiFe PBA@Cu2O photocatalytic system with EY as the photosensitizer has excellent catalytic activity (4680.6 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1)) and stability, being 4.85 and 128.6 times that of NiFe PBA and Cu2O, respectively. The increased catalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic action of NiFe PBA and Cu2O. On the one hand, the introduction of Cu2O with nanosphere structure can effectively prevent the aggregation of NiFe PBA cubes and improve the utilization rate of sunlight. NiFe PBA loaded on the Cu2O surface provides a rich active site for the catalytic reaction. On the other hand, the built-in electric field established between NiFe PBA and Cu2O significantly facilitates the transfer and separation of photo borne carriers. In situ XPS verifies the formation of the p-n heterojunction, and the p-n heterojunction formed at the NiFe PBA and Cu2O interfaces can provide a channel for effective charge transfer, helping to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution capacity. This work provides a new direction for the rational design of p-n heterojunctions, and shows the potential application prospects in the field of renewable energy production.

In this study, four iron-based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) were prepared by coprecipitation (Co-Fe PBA, Mn-Fe PBA, Cu-Fe PBA and Fe-Fe PBA). The Co-Fe PBA exhibited high peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation performance for PNP degradation, removing over 90% of PNP in 60 min at an optimal pH of 7, temperature at 30 celcius, initial concentration of 20 mg/L, PBA dose of 0.2 g/L and PMS dose of 1 g/L. The physicochemical properties of the Co-Fe PBA were investigated by various characterization methods. The catalytic activity of PBA and the influence of various process parameters and water quality on the catalytic reaction were investigated to elucidate the mechanism of p-nitrophenol degradation by PBA-activated persulfate. Moreover, the mechanism of accelerated degradation of PNP under HCO3- conditions and the role of major reactive oxides were determined by EPR measurement methods and free radical trapping experiments. HCO3- was found to directly activate PMS to produce reactive oxygen species, and O-1(2), (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- were all greatly increased. This work presents a promising green heterogeneous catalyst for the degradation of emerging contaminants (ECs) in real wastewater with natural organic matter and coexisting anions by PMS activation.

However, their commercial applications are hindered by low capacity utilization and insufficient cycle life. Here, we report on a MnCoNi-co-doped Prussian blue analogue with high purity and crystallinity by a citrate-assisted controlled crystallization process. Moreover, a novel strategy of in situ capturing for residual coordinated water during sodiation/desodiation process is proposed to achieve a high cyclability by using the aluminium chloride Lewis acid as electrolyte additive. The reversible cubic-rhombohedral phase transition is revealed by in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transient electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The MnCoNi-co-doped composite delivers a capacity of 111 mAh g(-1) even at 1C and retains a capacity retention of 78.7% after 1500 cycles for sodium ion batteries. This work provides important insights on eliminating the parasitical coordinated water in lattice and modulating the crystallinity to develop high-performance Prussian blue and its analogues.					王, 家钧/AAH-4288-2021; Wang, Liguang/HCH-5206-2022; LI, HAIFENG/AAZ-1811-2021	Wang, Liguang/0000-0003-3000-3256; Xie, Bingxing/0000-0003-4159-9753; LI, HAIFENG/0000-0001-8186-1125													2211-2855	2211-3282				JUL	2019	61						201	210		10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.059													WOS:000471201800024

Nevertheless, the performance of SIBs is severely restricted by the availability of satisfactory cathode nanomaterials with stable frameworks to accommodate the transportation of large-sized Na+ ions. These challenges can be effectively resolved when exploiting Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs (PBAs) as SIB cathodes. This is mainly because PB and PBAs have 3D open frameworks with large interstitial space, which are more favorable for fast insertion/extraction of Na+ ions during the charging/discharging process, thus enabling the improvement of integrated performance in SIB systems. This overview offers a comprehensive summarization of recent advancements in the electrochemical performance of PB and PBAs when employing them as cathodes in SIBs. For better understanding, the fabrication strategy, structural characterization, and electrochemical performance exposition are systematically organized and explained according to tuning PB and metal-based PBAs. Additionally, the current trajectories and prospective future directions pertaining to the utilization of PB and PBA cathodes in the SIB system are thoroughly examined and deliberated upon. This contribution provides a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in the electrochemical performance of PB and PBAs as SIBs cathodes. It covers various aspects, including the fabrication strategy, structural characterization, Na-ion storage mechanism, and electrochemical performance exposition, with a focus on tuning PB and metal-based PBAs.image					zhang, yiheng/HQZ-1831-2023; Gao, Xin/IQS-1866-2023	Gao, Xin/0000-0002-1542-1153													2366-9608					AUG	2024	8	8								10.1002/smtd.202301372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202301372		DEC 2023						38098164					WOS:001124529900001

As a catalyst, Prussian blue analog structured nickel hexacyanoferrate (Ni-HCF) with two distinct morphologically controlled frameworks, viz. granular crystalline bulk film and rose-petal like structured thin film having smooth surface, are synthesized via controlled anodization route, and their morphological influence on the ORR is investigated. In addition, the influence of addition of carbon black, which is commonly used as catalytic dispersing support, is also studied on the catalytic mechanism for the ORR. Based on the hydrodynamic voltammetry of the electrocatalytic films on rotating disk electrode, the number of electrons involved in the reduction of an O-2 molecule, and the kinetic current density of the reaction are estimated. While the pristine Ni-HCF frameworks based catalyst, regardless of their morphology, demonstrates the direct reduction of O-2 with participation of 4 electrons, the frameworks when mixed with carbon black as support diverts the reduction via two steps with participation of 2 electrons at each step. A larger kinetic current density is, however, obtained in the case of granular crystalline bulk film of the Ni-HCF frameworks.

Although the solvent-free mechanochemical grinding approach has been extensively used to create halide-based perovskites, no such reports have been made for cyanide-based double perovskites. Herein, an innovative solvent-free mechanochemical synthetic strategy is demonstrated for synthesizing Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3, Co3[Fe(CN)6]2, and Ni2[Fe(CN)6], where defect sites such as carbon-nitrogen vacancies are inherently introduced during the synthesis. Among all the synthesized PB analogs, the Ni analog manifests a considerable electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 288 mV to obtain the current benchmark density of 20 mA cm-2. We hypothesize that incorporating defects, such as carbon-nitrogen vacancies, and synergistic effects contribute to high catalytic activity. Our findings pave the way for an easy and inexpensive large-scale production of earth-abundant non-toxic electrocatalysts with vacancy-mediated defects for oxygen evolution reaction.

Manganese-based prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are ideal candidates for CDI electrodes due to their low cost and high theoretical specific capacity. However, the structural deformation caused by Jahn-Teller distortion deteriorates their cycling stability during CDI processes. Herein, a disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na2EDTA)-assisted coprecipitation method is developed to synthesize manganese prussian blue with Mn vacancies (MnPBA-VMn). Moreover, a nickel prussian blue (NiPBA) protection shell is formed outside the MnPBA-VMn by the ion exchange, replacing partial Mn ions with Ni ions. The MnPBAVMn/NiPBA show a high salt adsorption capacity of 109.44 mg g- 1 at 1 V in 500 mg L- 1 NaCl solution, and 84.9 % of capacity retention after 50 CDI cycles.

The adsorbed NH3 was desorbed by heating and washing with water or acid. Recently, we demonstrated that desorption was also possible by washing with a saturated ammonium hydrogen carbonate solution (sat. NH4HCO3 aq) and recovered NH3 as an NH4HCO3 solid by introducing CO2 into the washing liquid after desorption. However, this has only been proven for copper ferrocyanide and the relationship between the adsorption/desorption behavior and metal ions in PBAs has not been identified. In this study, we investigated the adsorption/desorption behavior of PBAs that are complexes of first row transition metals with hexacyanometalate anions. Six types of PBAs were tested in this study and copper ferricyanide exhibited the highest desorption/adsorption ratio. X-ray diffraction results revealed high structural stability for cobalt hexacyanocobaltate (CoHCC) and nickel ferricyanide (NiHCF). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results showed that the NH3 adsorbed on the vacancy sites tended to desorb compared to the NH3 adsorbed on the interstitial sites as ammonium ions. Interestingly, the desorption/adsorption ratio exhibited the Irving-Williams order.

In this study, a Prussian blue analog (PBA) has been coated on the surface of zinc foil to create an inorganic protective layer. This layer features a three-dimensional open microporous structure, which not only endows it with excellent pseudocapacitive properties but also serves as an effective barrier against dendrite growth. The presence of PBA coating can increase the nucleation point of zinc ions and provide a low-energy barrier for the rapid migration of zinc ions. Hence, the PBA@Zn ||PBA@Zn symmetric cell exhibits exceptional cycling stability, enduring over 1400 h of operation at a current density of 1 mA cm-2 and a capacity of 1 mAh cm-2. The PBA@Zn||AC capacitor demonstrated a discharge capacity of 46.23 mAh g-1 after 10 000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1, with a capacity retention of 92.41%, whereas the discharge capacity of Zn||AC capacitor is only 16.02 mAh g-1, with a capacity retention of 23.13%. The PBA@Zn||AC capacitor exhibited remarkable endurance and stability, retaining a substantial discharge capacity of 32.7 mAh g-1 after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g-1. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations also show that PBA has a strong interaction with Zn and exhibits superior zincophilic ability. This study reports industrially applicable low-cost Prussian blue analogs as artificial interfacial protective layers for improving the cycling stability of zinc anode with a low-energy barrier for rapid migration of zinc ions especially at high current density. The industrially applicable low-cost PBA of K2Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2<middle dot>9H2O as the zinc anode protective layer is prepared. This protective layer can effectively inhibit zinc dendrite formation, and improve zinc electrode corrosion resistance. The capacitor assembled by this PBA as artificial interfacial protective layers can significantly improve the cycling stability of zinc anode with a low-energy barrier for rapid migration of zinc ions. image					Xu, Zhenming/J-5717-2017; Shen, Laifa/K-1106-2019; Tong, Hao/JCE-7052-2023; Zhang, Xiaogang/G-8896-2013	Zhang, Xiaogang/0000-0003-4464-672X; Xu, Zhenming/0000-0002-7039-3845													1616-301X	1616-3028				NOV	2024	34	46								10.1002/adfm.202405318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202405318		OCT 2024											WOS:001326643300001

However, PBAs usually suffer from kinetic problems during the electrochemical reactions due to sluggish Na+ diffusion in the large crystals, resulting in low-capacity utilization and inferior rate capability. In this study, we present a facile etching method aiming at activating the sodium storage sites and accelerating the Na+ transport of Na2NiFe(CN)(6) (denoted as NaNiHCF) by precisely controlling its morphologies. A progressive corner passivation phenomenon occurred in NaNiHCF during the etching process, which led to a substantial augmentation of the specific surface area as the morphology transitioned from a standard cube to a dice shape. Notably, by controlling the etching time, the obtained NaNiHCF-3 electrode exhibited boosted electrochemical performance with high reversible capacity of 83.5 mAh g(-1) (98.2% of its theoretical capacity), superior rate capability (71.2 mAh g(-1) at 10 C), and stable cycling life-span at different temperatures. Both experimental and computational methods reveal the remarkably reversible structural evolution process and improved Na+ diffusion coefficient. We believe that this work can serve as an indispensable reference to tailor the structure of PBAs to obtain improved electrochemical performance.

However, their electrocatalytic capability is limited by their inclination to agglomerate and the insufficient exposure of active sites. In this work, a three-step strategy was used to develop a bifunctional electrocatalyst with porous Prussian blue analogs supported on carbon nanofibers. The use of electrospun carbon nanofibers as conductive substrates can successfully address the problem of easy aggregation. Moreover, the etching procedure with tannic acid creates a porous structure that effectively regulates the electrical structure and exposes additional active sites. The resulting catalyst performs well in both the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction, and also exhibits good stability in overall water splitting.

Here, we developed a simple strategy to prepare an efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution by partially phosphating NiFe-LDH and then etching and growing Prussian blue analogues on it. Benefiting from its unique hierarchical structure, the synthesized NiFeCo PBA-NiFeP catalyst showed excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1 M KOH. At 100 mA/cm2, the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is only 245 mV and exhibits stability for over 50 h. This is superior to most of the OER catalysts reported so far. Its excellent performance is due to its unique hierarchical structure and the synergistic effect between polymetals, which enables it to have abundant active sites and efficient electron transfer. This controllable and universal strategy will provide a new idea for developing interfacial composites and preparing high efficiency electrocatalysts.

The low practical capacity and poor cycling stability of PBAs, however, limit their wide practical deployment. To address these issues, a new strategy is deployed through introducing Fe vacancies and Cu-dopant into the PBAs frame structure, boosting the specific capacity and improving the cycling stability. On the one hand, the introduction of Fe vacancies in PBA (PBA square Fe) can provide additional storage sites and facilitate Na+ diffusion kinetics, yielding a high capacity of approximate to 164 mAh g(-1) at a low current density which approaches the theoretical capacity. On the other hand, the Cu-dopant is further helpful in stabilizing the structure of PBA square Fe, thus improving the cycling stability. This work paves a new strategy that enables unlocking the capacity and improving the cycling stability of PBA materials toward high-performance SIBs.

The hollow Co(OH)(2) nanocubes were firstly formed through chemical treatment of PBA in a NaOH solution then converted into hollow CoOx nanocubes with porous shell at 40 degrees C in air. The CoOx nanostructures were characterized in detail by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic properties of the hollow CoOx nanocubes with porous shell were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. The resulted nanostructures were used to construct a novel glucose sensor with good performance owing to the good catalytic activity and high surface area of hollow CoOx nanocubes with porous shell.

Using Co-CoPBA as the precursor, the porous Co9S8/N-doped carbon (Co9S8-CN) nano structure was formed after heat treatment and sulfidation processes. To further improve the electrocatalytic activity of the composite, Mo2C was introduced within the porous Co9S8-CN. The Mo2C/Co9S8-CN materials containing different contents of Mo2C were prepared via high-temperature calcination and subsequent sulfidation. Ultimately, for electrochemical hydrogen storage, the porous Co9S8-CN exhibited higher discharge capacity than conventional Co9S8 prepared by hydrothermal method. The special porous structure and large specific surface area derived from Co-CoPBA provided more electrochemical activesites. The conductivity of Co9S8 was enhanced due to the existence of N-doped carbon. Additionally, the electrochemical performance further enhanced owing to the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the embedded Mo2C species. The Mo2C/Co9S8-CN2 electrode showed an optimum discharge capacity of 647.4 mAh/g. Moreover, the high-rate dischargeability (HRD), corrosion resistance and kinetic properties were also improved after Mo2C loading. Consequently, Mo2C/Co9S8-CN can be used as a potential electrochemical hydrogen storage material.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We propose a simple and novel system to form precipitation patterns of Cu-Fe-based Prussian blue analogues (Cu-Fe PBA) in agarose gel through coupled electrochemical reactions, reactant ion diffusion influenced by electric field, and precipitation reactions. The spatiotemporal evolution, spatial distribution, and crystallite morphologies of the precipitates were investigated by visual inspection, Fe K alpha intensity distribution measurements, and optical and scanning electron microscope observations. The observed precipitation patterns and their evolution depended on the applied voltage. Multicolored periodic precipitation bands were stochastically formed under cyclic alternating voltage (4 V for 1 h and then 1 V for 4 h per cycle). The distances between adjacent bands were randomly distributed (0.30 +/- 0.25 mm). The sizes and shapes of the crystallites generated in the gel were position-dependent. Cubic but fairly irregular crystallites (0.1-0.8 mu m) were formed in the periodic bands, whereas definitely cube-shaped crystallites (1-3 mu m) appeared close to the anode. These cube-like reddish-brown crystallites were assigned to Cu-Fe-II PBA. In some periodic bands, plate-like blue crystallites (assigned to Cu(OH)(2)) were also present. Future issues for potential applications of the observed periodic banding for selective preparation of Cu-Fe PBA crystallites were discussed.

Herein, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4- to directionally tune the enrichment of elements, is proposed to restrain structural degradation and induce unconventional energy coupling phenomenon. The non-uniform distribution of elements at the M1 site of PBAs (NFM-PB) is manipulated by the sequentially precipitated Ni, Fe, and Mn according to the Irving-William order. Electrochemically active Fe is operated to accompany Mn, and zero-strain Ni is modulated to enrich at the surface, synergistically mitigating with the enrichment and release of stress and then significantly improving the structural stability. Furthermore, unconventional energy coupling effect, a fusion of the electrochemical behavior between FeLS and MnHS, is triggered by the confined element distribution, leading to the enhanced electrochemical stability and anti-polarization ability. Consequently, the NFM-PB demonstrates superior rate performance and cycling stability. These findings further exploit potentialities of the adjustable composition property and provide new insights into the component design engineering for advanced PBAs. Inspired by the Irving-William order, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4- to directionally tune the enrichment of elements at the M1 site of Prussian blue analogues, is proposed to restrain localized enrichment and release of stresses and induce structure-driven energy coupling phenomenon. image					Zou, Guoqiang/W-9533-2019; Deng, Wen-Tao/AAC-4754-2021; banks, craig/A-8889-2013; Ji, Xiaobo/AFO-0372-2022; Hong, Ningyun/KVY-1007-2024; Hu, Xinyu/KIK-7663-2024; Hou, Hongshuai/P-2876-2018; Silvester, Debbie/D-4679-2013														1433-7851	1521-3773				OCT 1	2024	63	40								10.1002/anie.202410420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.202410420		AUG 2024						38961660					WOS:001297238700001

However, the cycle life of PBA is limited due to its structure instability during cycling. Here, we successfully introduce six transition metals into N coordination site to increase the configurational entropy, significantly improving the structure stability and cycle life of PBA cathode materials. Electrochemical characterization methods are used to compare the behavior of hexa-, penta-, quadr-, and tri-metal PBA, exhibiting the characteristic of performance increasing with entropy. Time-resolved in situ X-ray diffraction confirms the "quasi-zero-strain" structure of H-PBA during desodiation/sodiation process. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that Mn, Fe, Co and Cu contribute the high capacity of H-PBA, while Ni and Zn stabilize the structure. The strategy will inspire new ideas in designing long life cathode materials with high capacity for sodium-ion batteries.

Here, an anodized Prussian blue analogue (PBA) containing Ni and Co is reported as a promising OER electrocatalyst in alkaline media. Detailed post-mortem characterizations indicate the transformation from PBA to Ni(OH)(2) during the anodic process, with the amorphous shell of the PBA facilitating the transformation by promoting greater structural flexibility. Further study with operando Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the increase of anodic potential improves the degree of deprotonation of the transformed core-shell PBA, leading to an increase of Ni valence. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the increase of Ni valence results in a continuous increase in the adsorption strength of oxygen-containing species, exhibiting a volcano relationship against the OER activity. Based on the experiments and calculated results, an OER mechanism for the transformed product is proposed. The fully activated catalyst also works as the cathode and the anode for a water-splitting electrolysis cell with a high output current density of 13.7 mA cm(-2) when a cell voltage of 1.6 V applied. No obvious performance attenuation is observed after 40 h of catalysis.

The results showed that 3D rGO/PBAs had high specific surface and good hydrophilic property, which was beneficial to the exposure of adsorptive sites and the transfer of adsorbates. The composite exhibited excellent adsorption performance towards Cs(I), and the maximum adsorption capacity was up to 204.9 mg/g, higher than most of reported values. The pseudo second-order kinetic model (R-2 = 0.999) and the Langmuir isotherm model (R-2 = 0.997) could fit the adsorption processwell, suggesting the nature of homogeneous monolayer chemisorption. High distribution coefficients (k(d)) (2.8 x 10(4) to 5.8 x 10(4) mL/g), revealed that the composite had good selectivity.

Their applicability, however, is limited by the availability of intercalation frameworks capable to intercalate the target ion of interest. We report that Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) can serve as versatile iREs for a range of target ions of clinical interest, such as Na+, K+, or Ca2+. Combining target-ion intercalated PBAs with ion-selective membranes results in a family of all-solid SC-ISEs, which are capable as ISEs with an inner filling, yet cheap and suitable for mass-production. The SC-ISEs standard potential is predictable and can be tuned by altering the PBAs redox-active transition metal or by changing its state of charge.

Prussian blue analogue (PBA) demonstrates great advantages as the cathodes for SIB owing to its simple synthesis method, inexpensive raw materials, and high theoretical specific capacity.

However, due to the disadvantages of easy agglomeration, poor conductivity and easy structural collapse, the further applications of PBAs had been seriously limited. To break these limitations, the 3D composite material NaFeHCF@CNT was successfully synthesized by simple coprecipitation method through dotting NaFeHCF nanoparticles on the staggered carbon nanotube network. As expected, the NaFeHCF particles were uniformly embedded in the CNT networks without any agglomeration resulting in higher specific surface area and utilization. Due to the doping of carbon nanotubes, NaFeHCF@CNT enhanced charge transfer and ion diffusion, resulting in low charge transfer resistance and good wettability, thus benefiting CDI performance. In the desalination performance test, the NaFeHCF@CNT electrode could achieve a high desalination capacity of 82.97 mg g(-1) and a low energy consumption of 2.78 kg NaCl kWh(-1) in 3000 mg L-1 NaCl, and the desalination capacity could still reach 89.82% of the initial value after 50 cycles. Consequently, the NaFeHCF@CNT achieves high desalination performance in CDI systems.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) serving as distinctive Metal-organic frameworks, feature a multi-electron, multicore structure, as well as exceptional properties like structural stability and compositional adjustability. These attributes endow them with significant promise in the realm of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, the six kinds of common transition metal salts were employed in synthesizing Prussian blue analogues (Cd-Co PBAs, Cu-Co PBAs, Co-Co PBAs, Ni-Co PBAs, Zn-Co PBAs and In-Co PBAs) featuring varying metal compositions through the chemical co-precipitation method. A comprehensive analysis was subsequently carried out to explore the connection between their structural features and properties. The six kinds of Prussian blue analogues were directly used as catalysts to evaluate their performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, accompanied by a thorough investigation into the impact of their structural variations on their ability to facilitate photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Among them, Ni-Co PBAs has the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (6197.4 mu mol h-1 g-1) and the highest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 5.75 % at 475 nm due to the suitable band gap structure and the ideal MII/MIII atomic ratio (3:2). When explaining the correlation between electronic structure and properties of PBAs, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation gives further insight. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the structure and properties of PBAs, which will provide a sustainable strategy for the development of photocatalysts based on PBAs for achieving high conversion efficiency of solar energy into hydrogen energy.

In this study, a one-pot strategy is proposed for the synthesis of MnFe PBA open cages. The materials are subsequently employed as cathode electrode in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The simultaneous evolution of structure, morphology, and performance during the synthesis process is investigated. The findings reveal substantial structural modifications as the reaction time is prolonged. The manganese content in the samples diminishes considerably, while the potassium content experiences an increase. This compositional variation is accompanied by a significant change in the spin state of the transition metal ions. These structural transformations trigger the occurrence of the Kirkendall effect and Oswald ripening, culminating in a profound alteration of the morphology of MnFe PBA. Moreover, the shifts in spin states give rise to distinct changes in their charge-discharge profiles and redox potentials. Furthermore, an exploration of the formation conditions of the samples and their variations before and after cycling is conducted. This study offers valuable insights into the intricate relationship between the structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance of MnFe PBA, paving the way for further optimizations in this promising class of materials for energy storage applications. A one-pot synthesis of manganese-doped Prussian blue analog open cages is achieved by combining the Kirkendall effect and Oswald ripening. Its formation and energy storage mechanisms are revealed. The correlation among material structure, morphology, and performance is further discussed. image					Wang, Weilu/HZI-7554-2023; Nie, Chuanhao/KAM-5127-2024; , Zhicheng/O-2116-2016	, Zhicheng/0000-0002-6316-282X; Xing, Zheng/0000-0002-0915-1820													1613-6810	1613-6829				SEP	2024	20	38								10.1002/smll.202402072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202402072		MAY 2024						38773874					WOS:001228404600001

Unfortunately, electrochemical performances of MnFe-PBAs are inevitably hindered owing to the crystal vacancies and crystal water produced from aqueous co-precipitation process. Herein, highly crystallized cubic potassium-doped sodium manganese iron-based Prussian blue analogue is synthesized by a modified co-precipitation method. By introducing a larger ionic radius potassium (K) to substitute the part of Na in the MnFe-PBAs, a coexistence composite of sodium and potassium phases is obtained with less crystal water and fewer vacancies compared with pure sodium phase compound, resulting that potassium-doped sodium manganese iron-based Prussian blue analogue (Na1.08K0.74Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.86)center dot square(0.14)center dot 1 center dot.86H(2)O, NaKMHCF) can deliver high discharge specific capacity (129.3 mAh/g at 10 mA g(-1)), excellent rate performance (82.3 mAh/g at 1500 mA g(-1)) as well as high cycling stability (77.0 % capacity retention at 500 mA g(-1) after the 500th cycle).

However, the resulting polyols predominantly contain predominantly secondary hydroxyl groups (up to 95%) that are less reactive than those capped with primary hydroxyl groups, thereby limiting the applications of the former in polyurethane synthesis. In this study, a viable procedure for producing alpha,omega-primary hydroxyl-terminated polyols using various Prussian blue analogs as heterogeneous catalysts was developed. The reaction kinetics were first investigated to gain insight into the reactivity of primary and secondary alcohols in the ring-opening of epsilon-caprolactone. Subsequently, epsilon-caprolactone-capped polyols with predominantly primary hydroxyl groups were successfully synthesized via the ring-opening reaction of epsilon-caprolactone using polypropylene glycol as the macroinitiator. The reactivities of the resultant epsilon-caprolactone-capped polyols for polyurethane synthesis were greatly enhanced compared to those of conventional polyols.

However, the aqueous-based synthesis of PBAs inherently introduces three different forms of water molecules (surface, interstitial and crystal) into the structure. Removal of water molecules causes phase transformation from monoclinic (M) to rhombohedral (R). This work presents the effects of water molecules on the structure before the phase transformation temperature, employing two promising PBA cathodes, Na2Fe[Fe(CN)6]<middle dot>1.69H2O and Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6]<middle dot>1.76H2O. Specifically, the water molecules impact the molecular interactions at the local structure and the electrochemical properties. This work has performed calculations on low-vacancy Na2M[Fe(CN)6] PBAs (where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) to understand the dehydration energy. Employing in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, this work observes that water removal induces negative thermal expansion and stronger interactions between C equivalent to N and Na ions, resulting in biphasic reactions with sluggish kinetics. Additionally, water molecules play a role in maintaining the open 3D tunnels and facilitating a solid-solution like insertion of Na ions. Calculated phonon-Raman spectra provide insights into cyanide group deformations, revealing the interactions between water molecules, alkali-ions, and transition-metal ions. This study enhances the understanding of the relationship among electronic, vibrational, and electrochemical properties. The interaction of water molecules and their influence on the electrochemistry of Prussian blue analogues are presented. The hydration behavior of these materials is rapid, emphasizing their sensitivity to water molecules and the necessity for controlled electrode processing. The interstitial water molecules assist a solid-solution type insertion of Na ions. image					Manthiram, Arumugam/AAO-3331-2020; Sada, Krishnakanth/M-5392-2017; Siegel, Donald/KYQ-7617-2024	Kmiec, Steven/0000-0002-0005-678X													1613-6810	1613-6829				DEC	2024	20	50								10.1002/smll.202406853	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202406853		SEP 2024						39344163					WOS:001321420900001

However, the poor recovery ability of PBAs has limited their practical applications. In this work, PBA was firstly immobilized using zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) via a facile in-situ growth method. The decoration of PBA onto the surface of ZIF-8 was well confirmed by TEM, XRD, FTIR and XPS. The catalytic efficiency of the PBA-ZIF8 composite was significantly higher than that of pure PBA and ZIF-8 on the activation process of peroxymonosulfate when rhodamine B (RhB) was employed as a target contaminant. RhB degradation efficiency was effectively promoted at relatively high PBA-ZIF8 dosage and PMS concentration, as well as in near-neutral pH medium. Sulphate radicals obviously played a predominant role in attacking RhB during the whole reaction. In addition, PBA-ZIF8 also possessed good stability and reusability with negligible cobalt leaching. Therefore, the PBA-ZIF8 composite was a conveniently prepared and promising catalyst that may be employed to remediate contaminated water due to its excellent catalytic activity and recyclability.

J	Sun, YN; Wang, L				Sun, Yaning; Wang, Lei			The negative thermal expansion behavior in Prussian blue analogue Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2: A first-principles study	PHYSICS LETTERS A												We have studied the electronic and thermal expansion properties in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 by first-principles calculation. The results show that Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2 is an insulator with an indirect band gap. The composition of valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) can be obtained. It is demonstrated that Fe-C and Zn-N are strong ionic bonds and C-N is a strong covalent bond combining qualitative and quantitative analysis. The negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior has been confirmed. It is found that low-frequency phonons play a significant role. Especially, acoustic phonons have the most negative mode/total Gruneisen parameter, suggesting their greatest contribution to the NTE behavior. From the mode analysis of low-frequency optical phonons, we can know that the NTE behavior is closely associated with transverse vibration in the same direction of bridge atoms (C and N atoms) as well as polyhedral movements and distortions (FeC6 octahedron and ZnN4 tetrahedron).(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Moita; Rodrigues Filho, Ubirajara P.; Cantanhede, Welter			New Hybrid Nanomaterial Based on Self- Assembly of Cyclodextrins and Cobalt Prussian Blue Analogue Nanocubes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												Supramolecular self-assembly has been demonstrated to be a useful approach to developing new functional nanomaterials. In this work, we used a cobalt Prussian blue analogue (PBA, Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)) compound and a -cyclodextrin (CD) macrocycle to develop a novel host-guest PBA-CD nanomaterial. The preparation of the functional magnetic material involved the self-assembly of CD molecules onto a PBA surface by a co-precipitation method. According to transmission electronic microscopy results, PBA-CD exhibited a polydisperse structure composed of 3D nanocubes with a mean edge length of 85 nm, which became shorter after CD incorporation. The supramolecular arrangement and structural, crystalline and thermal properties of the hybrid material were studied in detail by vibrational and electronic spectroscopies and X-ray diffraction. The cyclic voltammogram of the hybrid material in a 0.1 molL(-1) NaCl supporting electrolyte exhibited a quasi-reversible redox process, attributed to Co2+/Co3+ conversion, with an E-1/2 value of 0.46 V (vs. SCE), with higher reversibility observed for the system in the presence of CD. The standard rate constants for PBA and PBA-CD were determined to be 0.07 and 0.13 s(-1), respectively, which suggests that the interaction between the nanocubes and CD at the supramolecular level improves electron transfer. We expect that the properties observed for the hybrid material make it a potential candidate for (bio)sensing designs with a desirable capability for drug delivery.

Cyclic-voltammetry measurements show that its electronic state can be switched between five different redox states, which results in a remarkable electrochromic effect. Magnetic measurements on fresh samples point to the occurrence of a spin-state change near room temperature, which could be ascribed to a metal-to-metal electron transfer converting the {Fe-II-CN-Mn-III} pair into a {Fe-III-CN-Mn-II} pair. This feature was only previously observed in the polymeric MnFe Prussian-blue analogues (PBAs). Moreover, this novel switchable molecule proved to be soluble and stable in organic solvents, paving the way for its integration into advanced materials.

Catalytic selective oxidation of cyclohexane to KA oil (cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) is a typical representative of alkane functionalization. In this work, hollow cage-like Co3O4 (Co3O4-C) and particle Co3O4 (Co3O4-P) were synthesized by calcining two types of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), which were used to catalyze the selective oxidation of cyclohexane. The Co3O4-C predominantly exposed (311) crystal plane is easier to adsorb cyclohexane than Co3O4-P, which is beneficial to shorten the induction period, accelerate the reaction rate, and improve the conversion. Consequently, Co3O4-C displayed a 10% conversion of cyclohexane within 1 h, and the KA oil selectivity reached 90%. The Co3O4-P exposed (220) crystal plane has a higher molar percentage of oxygen vacancies and more active oxygen species, as well as a strong cyclohexanone adsorption capacity, which is conducive to the deep oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid and other diacid products. The mechanism analysis of cyclohexane oxidation catalyzed by PBA-based Co3O4 shows that it exemplifies the feasibility to tailor the surface of catalysts by modulating the PBAs, which ultimately influences their reaction performance for accelerating the reaction and maintaining high cyclohexane conversion and KA oil selectivity.					李, 可欣/IAP-2948-2023; Liu, Ruixia/C-8481-2019	Liu, Ruixia/0000-0003-3814-2592													1944-8244	1944-8252				FEB 1	2024	16	6					7252	7264		10.1021/acsami.3c17478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.3c17478		FEB 2024						38300279					WOS:001159001600001

Herein, we systematically synthesize a library of PBAs from binary to high-entropy by a facile coprecipitation method. The coordination environment in PBAs is explored by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which together with elemental mapping confirm the successful introduction of all metals. Importantly, electrochemical tests demonstrate that high-entropy PBA can serve as polysulfide immobilizer to inhibit shuttle effect and as catalyst to promote polysulfides conversion, thereby boosting its outstanding performance. Additionally, a variety of nanocubic metal oxides from binary to senary are fabricated by using PBAs as sacrificial precursors. We believe that a wide range of new materials obtained from our coprecipitation and pyrolysis methodology can promote further developments in research on PBA systems and sulfur hosts.																			1433-7851	1521-3773				OCT 10	2022	61	41							e202209350	10.1002/anie.202209350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.202209350		SEP 2022						36006780					WOS:000850889800001

The conversion of styrene over CsFeCoPBA-1 on the optimal condition reach up to 96%, in comparison to 88% over FeCoPBA. The catalysts were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and N-2 adsorption/desorption, respectively. To further illustrate the phenonmen, the detailed kinetic studies on epoxidation of styrene were carried out. It is found that the rate equations is similar between the catalyst CsFeCoPBA-1 and FeCoPBA, while the reaction activation energy with CsFeCoPBA-1 catalyst is reduced obviously. Meanwhile, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) had also been employed to directly probe thermodynamic changes during the formation of the PBA with or without Cs ions. It is noteworthy that higher enthalpy change in the presence of cesium ions.																			0009-2614	1873-4448				OCT 16	2018	710						180	187		10.1016/j.cplett.2018.09.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2018.09.003													WOS:000445778000030

CoHCC:Ni-foam annealed at 150 degrees C was free from zeolitic water content and exhibited a maximum specific capacity of 1118C g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and an excellent cycling stability over 5000 cycles with 89% retention in capacity. It was found that the maximum specific capacity is a result of contributions from the capacitive contribution (originating from the electric double layer capacitance and pseudo capacitance) and diffusion capacitance (originating from insertion/desertion of K+ ions in the CoHCC framework). Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor constructed from CoHCC:Ni-foam and activated carbon delivered specific energies of 22.5 Wh kg(-1) and 17 Wh kg(-1) at the specific powers of 990 W kg(-1) and 2464 W kg(-1), respectively, and exhibited excellent cycling stability over 5000 cycles.

Adding other active metals and designing special morphology are two effective pathways to deal with this issue. A series of microstructured iron-based spinel oxygen carriers are synthesized from thermal transformation of Prussian blue analogues (M-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), M = Co, Ni, Cu) using other active metals to exchange iron position in Prussian blue. Detailed characterization techniques and reactivity experiments are performed to explore the relationship among material structure, cyclic stability and CO yield. All the spinel oxygen carrier are obtained with special morphologies and good reactivity. Due to the different nature of doping metals, Co is helpful to maintain cubic structure while Cu would induce particle aggregation. Co-Fe shows a matched reduction and oxidation rates, while Cu-Fe and Ni-Fe exhibit a higher oxidation and a higher reduction rate, respectively. NiFe-Zr material shows a maximum STYCO of 2.15 mmol center dot s(-1)center dot kg(OC)(-1) with no deactivation. This is ascribed to two aspects: (i) Ni cannot be re-oxidized by CO2 but acts a catalytic site to improve activity, (ii) Fe3O4 rather than NiFe2O4 is preferred to be formed during redox cycles. This work provides a new way to design efficient spinel oxygen carriers for chemical looping CO2 conversion.

There are some challenges for PBAs cathodes, however, hindering their performance output, making them currently unacceptable for practical applications. To improve the performance and cycling stability of PBAs, a clear in-depth understanding of the relationship of their electrochemical reaction process to their ion insertion/extraction mechanisms and structural evolution is extremely important. Nowadays, advanced characterization techniques have become an important tool to guide the construction of high-performance PBAs cathodes. In this review, the various advances by using advanced characterization techniques to reveal the reaction mechanisms for PBAs cathodes are summarized and discussed. By appreciating how the advanced characterization techniques to guide fabrication of high-performance PBAs or reveal their detailed reaction mechanisms, it is hoped that this review can assist readers to find more valuable and advanced technologies to help to resolve some key problems and enhance their performance so as to accelerate the practical application of PBAs cathode for SIBs.

However, their practical applications suffer from low desalination capacity and poor cyclic stability. Here, an entropy engineering strategy is proposed that incorporates high-entropy (HE) concept into PBAs to address the unfavorable multistage phase transitions during CDI desalination. By introducing five or more metals, which share N coordination site, high-entropy hexacyanoferrate (HE-HCF) is constructed, thereby increasing the configurational entropy of the system to above 1.5R and placing it into the high-entropy category. As a result, the developed HE-HCF demonstrates remarkable cycling performance, with a capacity retention rate of over 97% after undergoing 350 ultralong-life cycles of adsorption/desorption. Additionally, it exhibits a high desalination capacity of 77.24 mg g-1 at 1.2 V. Structural characterization and theoretical calculation reveal that high configurational entropy not only helps to restrain phase transition and strengthen structural stability, but also optimizes Na+ ions diffusion path and energy barrier, accelerates reaction kinetics and thus improves performance. This research introduces a new approach for designing electrodes with high performance, low cost, and long-lasting durability for capacitive deionization applications. The HE-HCF electrode, which belongs to the high-entropy category, exhibits excellent desalination performance, including an impressive salt adsorption capacity and its remarkable cyclic stability. Structural characterization and DFT studies show that HE-HCF exhibits unprecedented enhancement in desalination performance due to its high entropy effect, low Na+ migration energy barrier, excellent reaction reversibility and, remarkable structural stability. image					Qiu, Jieshan/C-6276-2013; Wang, Gang/W-3820-2018	Wang, Gang/0000-0002-3185-1268														2198-3844				JUL	2024	11	28								10.1002/advs.202402340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.202402340		APR 2024						38666424					WOS:001208278000001

It is rare to derive CNTs from PBAs by means of C3H6 among the reported work and the structure evolution of NCNTs spheres derived from PBAs is exhibited. The high flow rate of N-2 and C3H6 tend to cause short CNTs and large diameter of CNTs, respectively, owing to the dual-effect of diffusion and deposition of C atoms. Due to the advantage superposition of CNTs with high length-diameter ratio and NiCo-Se NPs, NCNTs/NiCo-Se gets excellent capabilities of charge transfer, diffusion efficiency, and electrochemical reactions. When the C3H6/N-2 is 0.2/0.3 L min(-1), the as-fabricated NCNTs/NiCo-Se deliver a substantially appreciable specific capacitance of 171.1 mAh g(-1) (current density of 1 A g(-1)). The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) yields a maximum energy density of 55 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 801 W kg(-1).

Here, we proposed alkali-etched imprinted Mn-based Prussian blue analogues featuring superior oxidase-mimetic activity and precise recognition for the colorimetric sensing of TC. Simply etching Mn-based Prussian blue analogues (Mn-PBAs) with NaOH could expose the sites and surfaces to significantly improve their catalytic activity. Density functional theory calculations were employed to screen the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) layer for target identification. Consequently, the designed Mn-PBANaOH@MIP possessed the rich channels for substrates to get in touch with the active Mn-PBANaOH core, showing an excellent catalytic capacity to trigger the chromogenic oxidation of 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) without the use of H2O2. If TC was introduced, it would be recognized selectively by the MIP shell and masked the channels for TMB access, resulting in the obstruction of the chromogenic reaction. According to this mechanism, selective optical detection of TC was achieved, and performance stability, reusability, and reliability as well as practicability were also verified, promising potential for TC monitoring in complex matrices. Our work not only presents an effective way to enhance the enzyme-like activity of Prussian blue analogues but also provides a facile approach for TC sensing. Additionally, the work will inspire the exploration of molecularly imprinted nanozymes for various applications.																			1944-8244	1944-8252				MAY 10	2023	15	20					24736	24746		10.1021/acsami.3c02207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.3c02207		MAY 2023						37163688					WOS:000988821500001

Among many preparation methods of metal oxides, the annealing treatment of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) has unique advantages in designable and well-controlled structure, and this approach is regarded to be suitable for preparing the metal oxides with high crystallinity. At present, it is still a great challenge to obtain low-crystalline MOFs-derived metal oxides. In this study, we have skillfully taken advantage of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) in Mn-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA) and formed the low-crystalline Mn2O3/Co3O4 composite by an annealing process. The presence of PVP can weaken the crystallization of metal oxides during the annealing process and create structural disorder. The as-prepared low-crystalline Mn2O3/Co3O4 has an excellent specific capacitance of 478.7 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), which is 131.7% higher than the high-crystalline counterpart. Moreover, this material exhibits outstanding cycling stability (116.4% capacitance retention after 2500 cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitor consisting of low-crystalline Mn2O3/Co3O4 as the positive electrode and nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogel as the negative electrode delivers an energy density of 32.8 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 1190.1 W kg(-1). The superior electrochemical performances are mainly ascribed to the formation of low-crystalline Mn2O3/Co3O4 that provides more reversible active sites and accelerates ion diffusion. It is expected to open up a new avenue to the preparation of low-crystalline metal oxides for electrochemical energy storage. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) display many positive attributes such as open structural framework, large interstitial sites, and versatile transition metal redox activity. The PBA cathodes reported for CIBs often contain K-ion or Na-ion due to the syntheses involving the use of potassium or sodium hexacyanoferrate. It has been long overlooked whether the presence of K-ion or Na-ion in pristine PBAs could affect the Ca-ion storage in the PBAs when assessing their CIB performance. Through a combined experimental and computational investigation, this work reports that when K+/Na+ is present in the pristine PBAs, K/Na intercalation is preferred by the PBA structure over Ca intercalation even in the Ca cells. Ca-ion intercalation can be increased when the K+/Na+ content in the pristine PBAs is reduced, shifting from a K or Na-dominated intercalation process to a Ca/K or Ca/Na co-intercalation process. This work consolidates that PBAs are an interesting and versatile intercalation host for several ions, but investigating PBAs as intercalation cathodes requires careful consideration of all ions present in the battery system. Competition for ion intercalation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes is investigated for the application of Ca-ion batteries. K and Na intercalation are strongly favored over Ca intercalation. As a result, using K- or Na-containing PBA cathodes in the Ca electrolyte results in minimal Ca intercalation, and reducing K or Na amount in Ca cells can increase Ca intercalation.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH					Xu, Yang/C-2266-2012; luo, yudong/AAM-6700-2020; Han, YuPei/IAP-5219-2023; Vijaya Kumar Saroja, Ajay Piriya/JQW-2667-2023; li, mingrui/HTN-1013-2023; He, Pan/A-7259-2018; Liu, Yuhan/KLD-9478-2024	He, Pan/0000-0001-7150-6859; Liu, Yuhan/0000-0001-7019-3379														2688-4062				DEC	2024	5	12								10.1002/sstr.202400317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sstr.202400317		SEP 2024											WOS:001322052400001

Despite these advantages, the presence of numerous water molecules and vacancies within PBAs considerably reduces the available sites for sodium ion storage. Additionally, the precipitation of transition metal ions within the metal-organic framework during cycling limits sodium storage capacity and undermines the cycling stability of PBAs cathode materials. This review provides an overview of the basic structures of PB and PBAs and their construction methods, highlighting the relationship between structure and performance. It then systematically explores recent advancements in modifying the composition of PBAs and details various techniques, including process design, preparation methods, and electrochemical properties. Furthermore, the review offers conclusions and future development prospects, presenting new research ideas to guide the advancement of high-performance PB and PBAs. The primary innovation of this review lies in its indepth focus on the practicality and scalability of synthesis techniques, with a comprehensive discussion on controlling morphology and precision during the synthesis process.

The resulting grooved structure further enhanced the electrode material significantly. The results show that the etched sample delivers a discharge capacity of 153.3 mAh/g at 0.5 C and retains 83.3% after 200 cycles at 2 C. When the rate returns from 16 C to 0.5 C, the discharge capacity can be maintained at about 90.7%. Based on experimental analysis and theoretical calculation, the improved electrochemical performance of the etched sample is mainly attributed to the following three aspects: (1) fast diffusion of Na+; (2) reduced water content; (3) large contact area between electrode and electrolyte.

Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) and aqueous potassium-ion batteries (APIBs) present significant potential for large-scale energy storage due to their cost-effectiveness, safety, and environmental compatibility. Nonetheless, the intricate energy storage mechanisms in aqueous electrolytes place stringent requirements on the host materials. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), with their open three-dimensional framework and facile synthesis, stand out as leading candidates for aqueous energy storage. However, PBAs possess a swift capacity fade and limited cycle longevity, for their structural integrity is compromised by the pronounced dissolution of transition metal (TM) ions in the aqueous milieu. This manuscript provides an exhaustive review of the recent advancements concerning PBAs in ASIBs and APIBs. The dissolution mechanisms of TM ions in PBAs, informed by their structural attributes and redox processes, are thoroughly examined. Moreover, this study delves into innovative design tactics to alleviate the dissolution issue of TM ions. In conclusion, the paper consolidates various strategies for suppressing the dissolution of TM ions in PBAs and posits avenues for prospective exploration of high-safety aqueous sodium-/potassium-ion batteries.

The TC degradation efficiency of samples were investigated under various factors including Co loading, PMS dosage, initial TC concentration, pH, and inorganic anions. The mechanism for PMS activation indicated that reactive oxygen species including sulfate radicals, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen contributed to TC degradation.

Herein, the in situ scaffolding formation of well-distribute 3D NiFe Prussian blue analogue (NiFe PBAs) nanocubes penetrated 2D NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) on stainless steel mesh (SS) are synthesized, and then the precursors are transferred into 3D oxide arrays (SS@NiFe NSs@NiFe NCs) via thermal annealing in air.

The corresponding references were synthesized in powder form using the same ratio between the metal species in the reaction solution. The obtained samples were characterized via infrared (IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and magnetometry to understand the differences arising from the size reduction and the nature of the inserted alkali cation. We were able to show that the nature of the cation has a significant influence on the photoswitching properties at the macroscale in the powders. However, on the nanoscale, the influence of the surface contribution becomes more prominent and cooperative effects disappear, resulting in a new role of the alkali cation in the photomagnetic properties.

The morphologies and sizes of the micro-/nanocrystals can be easily tuned by HCl dosage and polymer additive. The as-prepared products are characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and Brunauer Emmet Teller adsorption-desorption analysis. The possible formation mechanism for these Zn-PBA micro-/nanocrystals is then proposed. In addtion, adsorption performances of these micro-/ nanocrystals toward organic dyes are systematically investigated. It is demonstrated that they exhibit strong adsorption selectivity to methylene blue (MB) with an extraordinary adsorption capacity as high as 1.016 g g(-1) due to the proper pore size and large specific surface area (643.2 m(2) g(-1)) of the product as well as the strong electrostatic interaction between MB molecules and Zn-PBA particles. It is found that the morphology and size of the micro-/nanocrystals have an important effect on their adsorption performance.

The Misconception of Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> Insertion into Prussian Blue Analogue Structures from Aqueous Solution	CHEMSUSCHEM												Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are commonly believed to reversibly insert divalent ions, such as calcium and magnesium, rendering them as perspective cathode materials for aqueous magnesium-ion batteries. In this study, the occurrence of Mg2+ insertion into nanosized PBA materials is shown to be a misconception and conclusive evidence is provided for the unfeasibility of this process for both cation-rich and cation-poor nickel, iron, and copper hexacyanoferrates. Based on structural, electrochemical, IR spectroscopy, and quartz crystal microbalance data, the charge compensation of PBA redox can be attributed to protons rather than to divalent ions in aqueous Mg2+ solution. The reversible insertion of protons involves complex lattice water rearrangements, whereas the presence of Mg2+ ion and Mg salt anion stabilizes the proton (de)insertion reaction through local pH effects and anion adsorption at the PBA surface. The obtained results draw attention to the design of proton-based batteries operating in environmentally benign aqueous solutions with low acidity.

J	Lee, JH; Bae, JG; Lee, HJ; Lee, JH				Lee, Ju-Hyeon; Bae, Jin-Gyu; Lee, Hyeon Jeong; Lee, Ji Hoon			Unveiling anomalous lattice shrinkage induced by Pi-backbonding in Prussian blue analogues	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY												Transition-metal (TM)-based Prussian blue and its analogues (TM-PBAs) have attracted considerable attention as cathode materials owing to their versatile ion storage capability with tunable working voltages. TM-PBAs with different crystal structures, morphologies, and TM combinations can exhibit excellent electrochemical properties because of their unique and robust host frameworks with well-defined < 100 > ionic diffusion channels. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the performance dependence of TM-PBAs on structural changes during charging/discharging processes. In this study, in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure analyses elucidate the TM dependent structural changes in a series of TM-PBAs during the charging and discharging processes. During the discharging process, the lattice volume of Fe-PBA increased while those of Ni-and Cu-PBAs decreased. This discrepancy is attributed to the extent of size reduction of the cyanometallate complex ([Fe(CN)6]) via pi-backbonding from Fe to C due to redox flips of the low-spin Fe3+/2+ ion. This study presents a comprehensive understanding of how TM selection affects capacity acquisition and phase transition in TM-PBAs, a promising class of cathode materials.

In addition, the capacitance of the mesoporous Co(OH)(2) nanocubes retained 82.4% of the initial value after 5000 cycles even at a high current density of 10 Ag-1. These indicates that the mesoporous Co(OH)(2) nanocubes are good candidates for supercapacitor electrode material. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, a series of ternary K2NixCo1-xFe(CN)(6) with various Co/Ni ratios are synthesized for potassium-ion batteries. By optimizing the Prussian blue analogue with Ni and Co connected to the N end, the ternary-metal K2Ni0.36Co0.64Fe(CN)(6) exhibits much higher performance as compared with that of the corresponding binary counterparts. Specifically, the ternary K2Ni0.36Co0.64Fe(CN)(6) delivers a high initial capacity of 86 mAh g(-1) with a retention of 98% after 50 cycles, which is much higher than that of K2NiFe(CN)(6) and K2CoFe(CN)(6). Moreover, the capacity retention remains up to 88% after 300 cycles, indicating the excellent stability of our ternary material. It is revealed by this work that the composition of the transition metal ions connected to the N end of the -C N- group could significantly affect the performance of the cathodes of Prussian blue analogues. Furthermore, this work may provide an efficient strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of Prussian blue cathodes for potassium ion batteries.					li, zhiyuan/HGD-9581-2022; Liao, Shijun/C-1745-2012; Lu, Xueyi/C-7290-2015; Huang, Bin/Q-2217-2015														2574-0962					SEP	2019	2	9					6528	+		10.1021/acsaem.9b01097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.9b01097													WOS:000487770000047

Prussian blue analogues (MM'-PBAs, A(x)M(y) [M'(CN)(6)], -nH(2)O: A = alkali metal; M/M' = transition metals), as a kind of potential electrocatalyst candidate for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are rarely studied. Herein, by a facile coprecipitation method, CoFe-PBAs were in-situ grown on the surface of highly conductive vanadium nitride (VN) particles. The hybrid CoFe-PBAs/VN achieves the amelioration of the poor conductivity of bare CoFe-PBAs and the increase in the density of Co2+ active sites due to electron interaction. Compared with bare CoFe-PBAs (over-potential of 398 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 78.35 mV dec(-1)), the CoFe-PBAsNN manifests a remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER (lower overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 39.72 mV dec(-1)), which is superior among PBAs and PBAs-derived materials reported as electrocatalysts for OER. Besides, this hybrid material behaves an excellent long-term durability. High conductivity of VN and electron interaction between VN and CoFe-PBAs contribute to the promoted catalytic performance. This study provides a novel strategy using VN substrates to support PBAs-based catalysts so as to obtain highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards practical applications.

A cost-efficient and facile strategy is developed to scalably fabricate triple-shelled hollow binary ZnO/ZnFe2O4 (ZZFO) metal oxides microspheres with excellent intimate heterojunctions through a morphology-inherited annealing treatment of single-resource Prussian Blue analogue of Zn-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot xH(2)O solid microspheres as self-sacrificial templates. The porous hybrid ZZFO triple-shelled hollow microspheres (TSHMSs) are demonstrated to be composed of crystalline ZnO and ZnFe2O4 nano-domains with well homogeneous dispersion at the nanoscale and large void spaces between adjacent shells. When evaluated as sensors towards acetone vapor, benefiting from the striking synergy and interplay between active bicomponents and the intrinsic structural advantages, the as-fabricated ZZFO TSHMSs sensor exhibited high performances, including excellent sensitivity, good selectivity and high reversibility, rapid response ability at ultralow working temperature (140 degrees C). Of great significance, these prominent findings may pave the way towards optimizational design and efficient fabrication of mixed metal oxides derived from other PBAs or even other MOFs as high-performance gas sensors in the future.

Recently, various special structures are constructed to improve the electrochemical properties of these materials. In this study, a novel architecture of Prussian blue analogs with large cavity and multilayer shells is investigated as cathode material for SIBs. Because the hollow structure can relieve volume expansion and core-shell heterostructure can optimize interfacial properties, the complex structure materials exhibited a highly initial capacity of 123 mA h g(-1) and a long cycle life. After 600 cycles, the reversible capacity of the electrode still maintains at 102 mA h g(-1) without significant voltage decay, indicating a superior structure stability and sodium storage kinetics. Even at high current density of 3200 mA g(-1), the electrode still delivers a considerable capacity above 52 mA h g(-1). According to the electrochemical analysis and ex-situ measurements, it can be inferred that the enhanced apparent diffusion coefficient and improved insertion/extraction performance of electrode have been obtained by building this new morphology.

The unique internal chemical tunability of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), a type of metal-organic framework materials (MOFs), makes them promising catalysts for PMS-AOPs. However, the pristine PBA is limited in practical application due to its structural instability and easy leaching of metal ions. To this end, various methods have been developed to enhance the recycling and catalytic performance of PBAs. In this paper, the recent advances in the modification and composite strategies of PBA catalysts are systematically reviewed. PBA modification by the regulation of synthesis conditions and postsynthesis treatment, along with composite strategy involving metal and nonmetal-based materials are introduced. The structural morphology improvement, physical and chemical property adjustment, vacancy design, and crystal surface modulation of PBAs induced by these modification and composite strategies are discussed in depth. In addition, the performance of the modified and composite catalysts to activate PMS for organic pollutant degradation is demonstrated. The radical pathway via SO4 center dot-, center dot OH, and O2 center dot-, nonradical pathway through 1O2, electron transfer process and high-valent metal-oxo species, or a combination of radical and nonradical pathways are revealed in PMS-AOPs with PBAs and their derivatives as catalysts.

However, manganese-based PBAs perform poorly during cycling due to the Jahn-Teller effect. In this study, highly stable manganese nitrosylpentacyanoferrate (Mn[Fe(CN)5NO]) particles were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method. The presence of nitroso group breaks the symmetry of the crystals to some extent, which is favorable to reduce the Jahn-Teller effect. Through experiments and DFT calculations, we confirm that the presence of linear (N--O) anions reduces the lattice volume fluctuations of the samples during charging and discharging, thus contributing to the mitigation of the Jahn-Teller effect. The electrochemical properties of Mn[Fe(CN)5NO] were significantly improved compared to manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnFe[CN]6). Mn[Fe(CN)5NO] exhibited excellent sodium storage performance with an initial discharge capacity as high as 144.5 mAh/g at 20 mA g-1and capacity retention as high as 82.1 % after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1. This Mn[Fe(CN)5NO] sample provides a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries in large-scale energy storage systems.

Prussian blue (PB) and PB analogs (PBAs) are frequently employed as electrode materials in SCs. Still, considerable capacitance degradation and inadequate Na+ diffusion kinetics considerably hinder the large-scale applications of PBAs. Consequently, herein, the efficient self-template strategy and anionic exchange method are used to synthesize yolk-shell structured PBA microspheres with an Mn:Co ratio of 5:1 (MnCo-PBA YSS). In a neutral electrolyte, MnCo-PBA YSS exhibits commendable electrochemical performance, achieving a specific capacitance of 280.0 F g- 1 at a current density of 1 A g- 1 and a capacitance retention of 70.1 % after 5500 charge-discharge cycles. A two-electrode system configured using MnCo-PBA YSS as the positive electrode and commercially available YP-50F as the negative electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 28.3 F g- 1 at 0.5 A g- 1. The remarkable electrochemical properties of MnCo-PBA YSS are attributed to the presence of internal voids, a shell composed of small nanoparticles, a high specific surface area, a low coordination water content, and minimized charge transfer resistance. These results indicate that MnCo-PBA YSS holds promise as a potential positive electrode material for SCs.

Here, we present that by designing the core-shell distribution of Prussian blue analogues, NiFe-P@CoFe-P nanocubes with various shell-thickness are obtained to unlock the synergy of metal phosphides. The NiFe-P@CoFe-P nanocubes display a low overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and great stability that outperform commercial RuO2 catalyst towards OER. We find that the OER and HER activity of NiFe-P@CoFe-P are dependent on the shell thickness, suggesting both the surface and sublayers determine the catalytic performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the water splitting under alkaline condition in an H-cell powered by commercial photovoltaics using NiFe-P@CoFe-P catalyst, which is a promising approach for the conversion of solar energy.

In the first step, silica cores are coated by a CoFe-PBA shell and then removed by etching with hydrofluoric acid (HF). The cubic shape of CoFe-PBA is well-retained even after the removal of the silica cores, resulting in the formation of hollow CoFe-PBA cubes. The specific capacity of the hollow CoFe-PBA nanocubes electrodes is about two times higher than that of solid CoFe-PBA nanocubes as storage materials for sodium ions. Such an improvement in the electrochemical properties can be attributed to their hollow internal nanostructure. The hollow architecture can offer a larger interfacial area between the electrolyte and the electrode, leading to an improvement in the electrochemical activity. This strategy can be applied to develop PBAs with hollow interiors for a wide range of applications.

Prussian blue analogues as platform materials for understanding and developing oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts	JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS												Transition metal based materials containing Fe have drawn great attention as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. The nature of the electrocatalytic active species remains under debate due to the ambiguous physicochemical properties of the catalyst materials, such as the oxidation states and crystal structures. Here, in order to address this issue, transition metal Prussian blue analogues (TM-PBA, Na(TM)(Fe) (CN)(6), TM = V, Fe, Co, and Ni) with an isomorphous structure are investigated for OER catalysis. Our combined experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that TM-PBAs exhibit volcano-like OER activity with Ni-PBA located near the top of the volcano. Such a volcano-like activity profile can be attributed to the distinctive binding energy difference between *O and *OH on different TM-PBAs surfaces. This work demonstrates that TM-PBAs can be used as platform materials for understanding structure-property-activity relationships in OER catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Enhanced hydrogen adsorption in alkali metal based copper hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue analogue nanocubes	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES												Two Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) Cu-II[Fe-III(CN)(6))](2/3)center dot 15H(2)O (1), and (KCuII)-Cu-I[Fe-II(CN)(6))](3/4)center dot 9H(2)O (2) are synthesised using a co-precipitation method at room temperature. The compounds are studied using XRD (x-ray diffraction), FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy), IR (infrared), Raman spectroscopy, and TGA (thermogravimetric analysis). The surface morphology of the compounds is investigated using the FESEM technique, which confirms the formation of cube-type microstructure with an average size of similar to 200 and similar to 120 nm for compounds (1), and (2), respectively. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) results, derived from the Rietveld refinement method, reveal that both the compound crystallized in a pure single nanocrystalline phase with face centred cubic crystal structure of space group Fm3m. The lattice constants are found to be similar to 10.04, and similar to 10.08 angstrom for the compound (1), and (2) respectively. The IR and Raman spectroscopy show characteristic peaks, observed in the range of 1900-2200 cm(-1), corresponds to the C N stretching frequency of Cu-II-C N-Fe-III/II, confirming the formation of PBAs compounds. The hydrogen adsorption isotherm measurements have been used to investigate the molecular hydrogen adsorption into PBAs compounds at low temperature (77 K) conditions. The compounds (1) and (2) show hydrogen storage capacity of similar to 1.12 and 1.63 wt %, respectively. The compound (2) shows an enhanced hydrogen capacity of similar to 45% as compared to compound (1), which is due to the presence of unsaturated Cu/Fe metal ions, and the larger surface area of the nanocubes in the framework structure. In addition, the presence of K+ ions in the compound (2) also strongly favours to catalysing more H-2 for their enhanced storage capacity.

Using a range of characterization techniques including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), this work discloses the process of replacement of K' by NH4' in the interstitial spaces of the CoFe PBA by a hot aqueous urea solution, which influences the transformation of PBAs under further heat treatment and the OER performance of the derivatives. After heat treatment at 400 degrees C under Ar flow, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images reveal that CoFe alloy nanoparticles grew on the crystalline cubes of CoFe PBA with K', while CoFe PBA cubes with NH4' become amorphous. Besides, the derivative of CoFe PBA with NH4' (Ar-U-CoFe PBA) performs better than the derivative of CoFe PBA with K' (Ar-CoFe PBA) in OER, registering a lower overpotential of 305 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a smaller Tafel slope of 36.1 mV dec-1, and better stability over a testing course of 20 h in 1.0 M KOH. A single-cell alkaline electrolyzer, using Ar-U-CoFe PBA and Pt/C for the anodic and cathodic catalyst, respectively, requires an initial cell voltage of 1.66 V to achieve 100 mA cm-2 at 80 degrees C, with negligible degradation after 100 h.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Here, we report low-cost Na-rich Mn-based Prussian blue analogues with superior rate capability and ultralong cycling stability over 10,000 cycles via structural optimization with electrochemically inert Ni atoms. Their thermal stability, all-climate properties, and potential in full cells are investigated in detail. Multiple in situ characterizations reveal that the outstanding performances benefit from their highly reversible three-phase transformations and trimetal (Mn-Ni-Fe) synergistic effects. In addition, a high sodium diffusion coefficient and a low volume distortion of 2.3% are observed through in situ transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. Our results provide insights into the structural engineering of Prussian blue analogues for advanced sodium-ion batteries in large-scale energy storage applications.

This study proposes a ligand-induced MOF-on-MOF approach to fabricate various trimetallic MnFeCo-based Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanostructures. The addition of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) transforms them from cuboids with protruding corners (MnFeCoPBA-I) to core-shell configurations (MnFeCoPBA-II), and finally to hollow structures (MnFeCoPBA-III). After pyrolysis at 800 degrees C, they are converted into corresponding PBA-derived carbon nanomaterials, featuring uniformly dispersed Mn2Co2C nanoparticles. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the Fe addition enhances catalytic activity, while Mn-doped materials exhibit excellent stability. Specifically, the optimized MnFeCoNC-I-800 demonstrates outstanding OER performance in 1.0 m KOH solution, with an overpotential of 318 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), maintaining stability for up to 150 h. Theoretical calculations elucidate synergistic interactions between Fe dopants and the Mn2Co2C matrix, reducing barriers for oxygen intermediates and improving intrinsic OER activity. These findings offer valuable insights into the structure-morphology relationships of MOF precursors, advancing the development of highly active and stable MOF-derived OER catalysts for practical applications.

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have attracted the attention of researchers because of their open skeleton structure and abundant redox active sites. However, the interstitial water in its crystal structure and poor electron conductivity limit its performance in sodium-ion batteries. A flexible self-supporting electrode is prepared by anhydrous preparation in a ball mill and simple filtration method. The high surface area nanoparticles and the high flexibility MXene layer in the electrode adapt to the rapid Na+ dynamics, alleviating the electrode expansion. The formation of a NaF-rich cathode-electrolyte interface (CEI) layer on the electrode surface inhibits the erosion of active substances by electrolyte, reduces the capacity attenuation of the electrode, and enhances the cyclic stability of the electrode. Electrode without a conductive agent and binder shows excellent electrochemical performance. The discharge capacity of the electrode is 58.3 mAh g  1at 1000 mA g  1 current density, and the capacity retention rate is 59.7% after 1000 cycles. This work has implications for the design of the next generation of low-cost, flexible, and fast charge and discharge energy storage devices.

Electrochemical energy storage, as the most popular and promising energy storage method, has received extensive attention. Currently, the most widely used energy storage method is metal-ion secondary batteries, whose performance mainly depends on the cathode material. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have a unique open framework structures that allow quick and reversible insertion/extraction of metal ions such as Na+, K+, Zn-2+,Zn- Li+ etc., thus attracting widespread attention. The advantages of simple synthesis process, abundant resources, and low cost also distinguish it from its counterparts. Unfortunately, the crystal water and structural defects in the PBAs lattice that is generated during the synthesis process, as well as the low Na content, significantly affect their electrochemical performance. This paper focuses on PBAs' synthesis methods, crystal structure, modification strategies, and their potential applications as cathode materials for various metal ion secondary batteries and looks forward to their future development direction.

Unfortunately, the commercialization of SIBs is mainly limited by available electrode materials, especially for the cathodes. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), emerge as a promising alternative for their structural feasibility in the application of SIBs. Decreasing the defects (vacancies and coordinated water) is an effective strategy to achieve superior electrochemical performance during the synthetic processes. Herein, we summarize crystal structures, synthetic methods, electrochemical mechanisms, and the influences of synthesis conditions of PBAs in detail. This comprehensive overview on the current research progresses of PBAs will give guides and directions to solve the existing problems for their application in SIBs.

However, La-containing Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) would be dissolved into aqueous solutions, which cannot act as a potassium-ion (K+) storage host. Here, an effective dynamic regulating strategy (chemical components and structures) is developed to overcome the high solubility of La-containing PBA in aqueous electrolytes and achieve high structural stability and superior aqueous K+ storage. For chemical component regulation, Fe3+ ions in the electrolyte fill the La3+ vacancies on the surface and the modified surface hinders the La atoms from further dissolving, and the remaining La atoms in bulk phase improve electron/ion transfer ability and amount of K+ storage. For the structure regulation, the material is transferred from the hexagon to the cubic lattice during charging-discharging procedures, achieving a highly thermodynamically optimal structure. The cathode presents ultrahigh capacities of 171, 155, 132, and 116 at current densities of 1, 2, 3, and 4 A g(-1) respectively, and the capacity remains almost constant after 1000 cycles. The mechanism is revealed by experiments and density functional theory (DFT).

This paper presents the first review of PBAs by applying the bibliometric visualization software CiteSpace. The co-occurrence, co-citation, and clustering analysis of 2214 articles in the Web of Science database on the topic of "Prussian blue analogs" over the past 20 years were performed. The results provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the research hotspots for this material, and most importantly, it is identified that the research hotspots and trends for PBAs materials are concentrated in the environmental and energy fields. For example, the material is used as an adsorbent or catalyst to reduce pollutants, produce clean energy, or for energy storage applications such as batteries or supercapacitors. Finally, some outlooks are provided on the future research trends of this material in the environmental and energy fields, presenting the challenges faced by this material. For instance, the conductivity and corrosion resistance of the material needs to be improved and secondary contamination should be decreased or even avoided. It is believed that this paper would provide a comprehensive, systematic, and dynamic overview of the research of PBAs, and promote the future research of PBAs in the fields of environment and energy.

In this study, cobaltembedded carbon nanofibers (Co@CNFs) are obtained via carbonization of electrospun cobalt Prussian blue analogue (Co-Co PBA) under nitrogen atmosphere. The Co@CNFs have metallic cobalt surrounded by graphitic carbon shells and possess high specific surface area, rich porosity, high graphitic degree, and rational nitrogen doping. The structure merits endow them with excellent electrocatalytic performances for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR): an onset potential of 0.867 V vs. RHE and 0.784 V vs. RHE at j = - 3 mA cm-2 with a four-electron transfer process. Through a further mild oxidation process, we obtain Co3O4 nanoparticles-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (Co3O4@CNFs) with spindle-like morphology. When working as the anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), Co3O4@CNFs show high specific capacity, good stability, and excellent rate capability. The Co3O4@CNFs anode delivers a discharge specific capacity of 1404 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1 and about 500 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 2000 mA g-1. The diffusion- and capacitive-controlled processes both contribute to the charge storage of the Co3O4@CNFs electrode. This study provides a new strategy to fabricate the excellent electrocatalysts for ORR and anode materials for LIBs via facile electrospinning. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Despite the changes in physical properties due to differences in the non -iron transition metal and the interatomic distance between Fe and the non -iron transition metal, there was almost no change in the structure of trivalent hexacyanoferrate ions. Although this result agrees with the conclusions of many previous structural analyses, it raises a new question compared to our previous research conducted soft X-ray absorption measurements at the Fe 2p edge, which states that the detailed electronic state of Fe varies in proportion to the interatomic distance between Fe and the non -iron transition metal.

Here, we use a facile and low-energy co-precipitation method to synthesize tri-metallic Prussian blue analogue (PBA) of FeCoNi-PBA. The FeCoNi-PBA exhibits promising catalytic performance in alkaline media, showing a low overpotential of 236 mV at 10 mA cm-2, small Tafel slope of 43.8 mV dec-1, and excellent long-term durability at 100 and 400 mA cm-2. We show that the FeCoNi-PBA is etched by the high-pH 1 M KOH electrolyte, and the anodic applied potential during electrolysis accelerates the formation of metal (oxy)hydroxide. In-situ Raman and post-mortem characterizations reveal that the applied anodic potential promotes the phase transformation to complete the reconstruction of PBA to metal (oxy)hydroxide embedded in a carbon matrix with fully exposed active sites. The metal (oxy)hydroxide serves as the real active sites while the carbon matrix with high con-ductivity and hydrophilicity facilitates the electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion.

Among them, binary Ni0.67Fe0.33Se2 coming from Ni-Fe PBAs shows obvious core-shell structure in a dual-carbon matrix, leading to enhanced electron interactions, electrochemical activity, and "metal-like" conductivity, which could retain an ultralong-term stability of 375 mAh g(-1) after 10 000 loops even at 10.0 A g(-1). The corresponding full-cell Ni-Fe PBAs versus Ni0.67Fe0.33Se2 deliver a remarkable Na-storage capacity of 302.2 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 A g(-1). The rational strategy is anticipated to offer more possibilities for designing advanced electrode materials used in high-performance sodium-ion batteries.					wei, xu/LFU-1444-2024; Ji, Xiaobo/AFO-0372-2022; Zou, Guoqiang/W-9533-2019; Hou, Hongshuai/P-2876-2018	Ge, Peng/0000-0002-6598-0375													0935-9648	1521-4095				JAN 18	2019	31	3							1806092	10.1002/adma.201806092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.201806092								30430659					WOS:000459628200018

Magnetic behavior of mixed spin prussian blue analog cylindrical nanowire	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												In this work, we implemented Monte Carlo simulations in order to describe the magnetic phase transition properties of a mixed ferro-ferrimagnetic ternary alloy cylindrical nanowire with formula AB(p)C(1-p). The ternary compound, known as Prussian Blue Analog, exhibits two interpenetrating lattices, one containig components with spin -3/2 and the other one with a random distribution of spin -1 and spin -5/2 compounds. The concentration of spin -3/2 compounds p, and the interaction ratio R were independently modulated to study their influence on the critical temperature, saturation magnetization and compensation temperature. The results show that it is possible to modify the transition temperature and saturation magnetization of the system just by manipulating p and R values, and it was determined, not only the existence of compensation in the sample, but also the fact that it is possible to determine the behavior of the compensation temperature by varying these parameters. In addition, a critical concentration value p(c), which is a threshold related to the compensation temperature, was determined from magnetization curves and compared to the one computed through a percolation analysis.

However, it remains challenge to develop an effective strategy for achieving strong interfacial interaction. Herein, a Janus nanoreactor consisting of TiO2 2D nanocrystals integrated with Prussian blue analog (PBA) single crystals is proposed and synthesized by mimicking the planting process. In situ etching of PBA particles induces nucleation and growth of TiO2 nanoflakes onto the concave surface of PBA particles, and thus enhances the interlayer interaction. The anisotropic PBA-TiO2 Janus nanoreactor demonstrates enhanced photocatalytic activities for both water reduction and oxidation reactions compared with TiO2 and PBA alone. As far as it is known, this is the first PBA-based composite that serves as a bifunctional photocatalyst for solar water splitting. The interfacial structure between two materials is vital for charge separation and transfer based on the spectroscopic studies. These results shed light on the elaborate construction of Janus nanoreactor, highlighting the important role of interfacial design at the microscale level.

The FeMn PBA@rGO composite shows distinctive microsphere structure with wrinkled surface, in which FeMn PBA polyhedron closely coated by rGO. This unique structure with well rGO coated shell could enhance the structural stability and provide effective charge transfer channels at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Moreover, the polar FeMn PBA could provide abundant adsorptions to capture soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytic sites to effectively accelerate LiPSs conversion reaction. Benefiting from this rational design, the Li-S cells with FeMn PBA@rGO host material exhibit an initial reversible capacity of 1145 mAh g-1 at 0.2C and good cycling stability.

Here, we applied a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) material K2Zn3(Fe(CN)6)2 as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), by which the plentiful -C equivalent to N- ligands at the surface and the large channels in the open framework structure can operate as a highly zincophilic moderator and ion sieve, inducing fast and uniform nucleation and deposition of Zn. Additionally, the dense interface effectively prevents water molecules from approaching the Zn surface, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen-evolution-resultant side reactions and corrosion. The highly reversible Zn plating/stripping is evidenced by an elevated Coulombic efficiency of 99.87% over 600 cycles in a Zn/Cu cell and a prolonged lifetime of 860 h at 5 mA cm-2, 2 mAh cm-2 in a Zn/Zn symmetric cell. Furthermore, the PBA-coated Zn anode ensures the excellent rate and cycling performance of an alpha-MnO2/Zn full cell. This work provides a simple and effective solution for the improvement of the Zn anode, advancing the commercialization of aqueous ZIBs.						chang, kun/0009-0008-4921-1446														1420-3049				APR	2024	29	7							1501	10.3390/molecules29071501	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules29071501								38611781					WOS:001200909300001

It has been extensively accepted that oxidative stress and inflammation closely correlate with the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques, and they directly participate in all stages of atherosclerosis. Regarding this, anti-oxidation or anti-inflammation drugs were developed to enable anti-oxidative therapy and anti-inflammation therapy against atherosclerosis. However, current drugs failed to meet clinical demands.MethodsNanomedicine and nanotechnology hold great potential in addressing the issue. In this report, we engineered a simvastatin (Sim)-loaded theranostic agent based on porous manganese-substituted prussian blue (PMPB) analogues. The biomimetic PMPB carrier could scavenge ROS and mitigate inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Especially after combining with Sim, the composite Sim@PMPB NC was expected to regulate the processes of atherosclerosis. As well, Mn2+ release from PMPB was expected to enhance MRI.ResultsThe composite Sim@PMPB NC performed the best in regulating the hallmarks of atherosclerosis with above twofold decreases, typically such as oxidative stress, macrophage infiltration, plaque density, LDL internalization, fibrous cap thickness and foam cell birth, etc. Moreover, H2O2-induced Mn2+ release from PMPB NC in atherosclerotic inflammation could enhance MRI for visualizing plaques. Moreover, Sim@PMPB exhibited high biocompatibility according to references and experimental results.ConclusionsThe biomimetic Sim@PMPB theranostic agent successfully stabilized atherosclerotic plaques and alleviated atherosclerosis, and also localized and magnified atherosclerosis, which enabled the monitoring of H2O2-associated atherosclerosis evolution after treatment. As well, Sim@PMPB was biocompatible, thus holding great potential in clinical translation for treating atherosclerosis.

As one of the most well-established categories of coordination compound, Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) have been found to show promising catalytic activities for 4-NP reduction. However, the nanoscale particle size hinder its application because of difficult separation, easy to loss during the recycling process and potential ecotoxicity. In this work, microstructured catalyst were prepared by in-situ growth of PBAs onto copper foam, and its catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) was investigated. Results showed that highly dispersed PBAs with size of similar to 350 nm were homogenously formed over the surface of copper foam. The structured catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity with conversion of 100% within 4 min, and with an activation energy (E-a) of 15.16 kJ.mol(-1) and turn over frequency (TOF) of 0.171 s(-1). These are comparable to most catalysts that have been reported. In addition, a homemade continuous flow catalysis system was constructed and the performance of the catalyst was investigated. Furthermore, no obvious deactivation was observed even after 6 cycles of catalytic reduction of 4-NP, showing its good catalytic stability and reusability. This study put forward a feasible approach to develop PBAs based catalyst for the practical application in industry. (C) 2021 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted researchers' attention due to the facile modulation of their atoms without bothering the existing lattice array, and their open 3D framework aids in ion conduction making it an excellent choice for developing advanced electrode materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of a trimetallic PBA by tuning the concentration of one of the metals. First, keeping the core ferricyanide structure intact, bimetallic cobalt PBA (Co-PBA) and zinc PBA (Zn-PBA) were prepared, yielding a specific capacitance of 96 and 77 F g-1, respectively, at 1 mA/cm2. However, in a trimetallic PBA with both cobalt and zinc introduced into the framework, the net specific capacitance plummeted to a higher value. The as-synthesized Zn0.04Co0.06-PBA achieved a specific capacitance of 203 F g-1 at 1 mA/cm2, which is an overall 211 and 263% increase compared to Co-PBA and Zn-PBA performance, respectively. An asymmetric device achieved a specific capacitance of 23 F g-1 at an operational voltage of 1 V. It also exhibited a capacitance retention of 84.6% after 2230 cycles with 100% Coulombic efficiency. The device yielded an energy density of 2.13 W h kg-1 and a power density of 76.75 W kg-1, which points out the fact that the developed material can truly revolutionize the field of energy storage.

Water and hydrazine are auspicious energy carriers because of their high hydrogen content and henceforth can be employed as chemical hydrogen storage materials or as fuels for the direct fuel cells. In the present study, cationic surfactant-assisted Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) i.e., M-x[Fe(CN)(5)(N2C6H4)]center dot yC(19)H(34)NBr abbreviated as SF[Fe-CNPy-M]; SF = N-tridecyl-3-methylpyridinium bromide and M = manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni), are synthesized and utilized as bifunctional heterogeneous OER and HzOR electrocatalysts under mild reaction conditions. The synthesis of electrocatalysts is confirmed by spectroscopic techniques i.e., Fourier transforms infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical measurements reveal an increase in current density, electrochemical surface area and catalytic stability compared to the reported PBAs for OER and HzOR. Among all the synthesized PBAs, SF[Fe-CNPy-Co] displays better electrochemical activity towards OER with 101 mV.dec(-1) Tafel slope and appreciably low overpotential value of 470 mV to attain the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). SF[Fe-CNPy-Co] is further tested for HzOR and the results show that it exhibits high activity with the diffusion coefficient of 3.55 x 10(-6) cm(2).s(-1) and rate constant of 3.411 x 10(-4) cm.s(-1).

Consequently, efforts have been undertaken to fabricate supercapacitors electrodes that resemble battery-type behavior. Owing to the unique structural characteristics and redox active sites, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are becoming attractive electrode materials. Herein, we presented the fabrication of ternary PBA-based electrode i.e., cerium cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CeCoHCF) with improved electrical properties and their characterization through different analytical techniques (SEM, FTIR, EDX, XPS, and XRD). The incorpo-ration of cerium and cobalt together in PBA framework imparts a positive effect on the electrochemical prop-erties. The as-synthesized CeCoHCF exhibits a significant specific capacity of 268.8 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 under alkaline conditions (3 M KOH) along with 88.6 % of capacity retention over 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the fabricated electrode exhibited the specific capacity 159.4 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 in neutral media (1 M Na2SO4). To investigate the practical application, symmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated that provides improved energy and power density as well as a wide operational voltage of around 1.2 V.

While, the existed coordinated water and vacancy defects will cause the skeleton collapsed and lattice disordered during the cycling process, which lower the coulombic efficiency and shorten the cycle consistency. Furthermore, the inferior electron transport of Fe-HCF further affects the charge-discharge performance. Herein, we designed a high-quality FeMnCu co-doped Prussian blue (PB) crystal and controlled its crystallization process with assistance of citrate. Moreover, a core-shell structure of conductive polyaniline (PANI) coated Prussian blue analogue (FeMnCu@PANI) was constructed. The as-developed FeMnCu@PANI as the cathode for SIB delivers a capacity of 107 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 1C and 82 mAh g(-1) at 10C. The capacity retention rate reaches similar to 90 % at 10C for 500 cycles. This FeMnCu@PANI crystal is nontoxic, high yield, low cost, and suitable for large-scale producing, which has great potential as cathode for SIB with high-capacity retention rate and long service life.

Herein, Cu-substituted Mn-PBA double-shelled nanoboxes (CuMn-PBA DSNBs) prepared by tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches are demonstrated for efficient Zn ion storage. The unique hollow structures can expose abundant active sites and alleviate the volume change during the cycling test. Moreover, partial Cu substitution and induced Mn vacancies might inhibit the Jahn-Teller distortions of Mn-N-6 octahedra, thus contributing to the prolonged lifespan. As a result, CuMn-PBA DSNBs exhibit high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage mechanism of CuMn-PBA DSNBs mainly involves the reversible redox reactions of transition metals and Zn2+ ion insertion/extraction processes.

The porous Co9S8/N-doped carbon (Co9S8-NC) nanostructure is fabricated via heat treatment and sulfidation processes employing CoCo-PBA as the precursor. The porous Co9S8-NC is mixed with RGO by ball milling to further improve the conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. For comparison, the conventional Co9S8 material is synthesized via hydrothermal process. During the electrochemical hydrogen storage test, the porous Co9S8-NC exhibit higher discharge capacity than conventional Co9S8. The conductivity of Co9S8 is enhanced due to the existence of N-doped carbon. The special porous structure and large specific surface area derived from CoCo-PBA provide more electrochemical active sites. Moreover, the electrochemical properties further improve after RGO modification because of the outstanding characteristics of RGO. A highest discharge capacity of 640.8 mAh/g is obtained for the Co9S8-NC/RGO electrode. Additionally, the cycling stability, HRD and kinetic properties are also enhanced with the addition of RGO. As a consequence, Co9S8-NC/RGO can be regarded as a promising material for electrochemical hydrogen storage.					jia, hongsheng/JCD-7973-2023; Su, yugang/HPH-1429-2023														2352-152X	2352-1538				NOV 15	2023	72		A						108334	10.1016/j.est.2023.108334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2023.108334		JUL 2023											WOS:001045484300001

We show here a reaction-diffusion method using a dormant reagent (citrate) for developing Liesegang patterns of cobalt hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue analog (PBA) particle libraries. This method slows the precipitation reaction and produces different-sized particles in a gel medium at different locations. The gel-embedded particles are still catalytically active. Finally, the applicability of the new method to other PBAs and 2D systems is presented. The method proves promising for obtaining similar inorganic framework libraries with catalytic abilities.

In this study, Mn-Prussian Blue Analog (Mn-PBA) is fabricated using a simple co-precipitation method and the morphology of Mn-PBA is further optimized through artificially manipulating concentration gradients strategy, effectively enhancing the structural stability of Zn2+ de-intercalation. Furthermore, the introduction of Mn established dual Zn2+ active centers in Mn-PBA (Mn-O and Fe(CN)6]4-/ [Fe(CN)6]3-), leading to an increased specific capacity. As a proof of concept for AZIBs, the optimized Mn-PBA-3 cathode exhibits a high reversible specific capacity of 143.5 mAh/g and maintains a capacity retention of 88.5 % after 250 cycles at 1 A/g, surpassing commercial MnO2 (30.5 mAh/g after 100 cycles). Mn-PBA-3 also delivers a high capacity of 79.0 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles of 10 A/g. The mechanism of the Zn2+ double redox reaction of Mn-PBA-3 has been revealed in detail by in situ Raman and a series of ex situ techniques. Under a high operating voltage window of 0-1.9 V, Zn//Mn-PBA-3 demonstrates a capacity of 99.3 mAh/g after 800 cycles (5 A/g) by assembling zinc ion button battery. This work has reference significance for structurally modulated PBAs used in high performance AZIBs.

The development of new cathode materials has always been a research focus in this field. Among them, Prussian blue materials, with their three-dimensional open and flexible metal framework structure, can efficiently and reversibly store potassium ions. However, Prussian blue cathode materials still face issues such as poor reversibility and low capacity, which limit their application scope. This study investigates the preparation of high-entropy Prussian blue analogues materials to enhance electrochemical performance. The doping of five different transition metals (Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Mn2+) sharing the same nitrogen coordination sites results in a configurational entropy greater than 1.5 R for the material. HEPB-1 cathode material (K1.75Mn0.26Fe0.01Ni0.01Cu0.08Co0.09 [Fe(CN)(6)](0.66)center dot 0.83H(2)O) shows better electrochemical performance, with the initial discharge capacity of 86.69 and 74.51 mAh g(-1) (capacity retention is 75.2% after 100 cycles) at 20 and 100 mA g(-1), respectively.

However, limited studies systematically compared Cs+ adsorption across different transition metals in PBA. This study investigates the influence of the choice of transition metal ion (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn) on Cs+ adsorption mechanisms and efficiency. PBAs were synthesized and characterized based on their specific surface area, ion exchange capacity, lattice parameter, and defect sites (as indicated by water molecule content). Cs+ adsorption mechanisms varied significantly with transition metals. In CoFe and FeFe PBAs, ion exchange with K+ dominated, while CuFe and MnFe PBAs, with more defect sites primarily used ion exchange between H+ and Cs+. NiFe and ZnFe exhibited enhanced Cs+ adsorption under light irradiation, likely due to their light-absorbing properties facilitating a reduction reaction. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm was applied to model the adsorption behavior, confirming that each performance of PBA depends on the transition metal used. These findings suggest that PBAs with various transition metals can efficiently remove 137Cs under diverse environmental conditions by using distinct adsorption mechanisms.

Surface effects and discontinuity behavior in nano-systems composed of Prussian blue analogues	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												Magnetic properties and hysteresis loops of a nano-ferrimagnetic surface-bulk Prussian blue analogues (PBA) have been studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We have reported the effects of the magnetic and the crystal fields, as well as the intermediate and the bulk couplings, the temperature and the size on the phase diagram, the magnetization, the susceptibility, the hysteresis loops, the critical and the discontinuity temperatures of the model. The thermal dependence of the coercivity and the remanent magnetization are also discussed. This study shows a number of characteristic behaviors, such as the discontinuities in the magnetizations, the existence of Q- and N-types behaviors in the Neel classification nomenclature and the occurrence of single and triple hysteresis loops with high number of step-like plateaus.

A speed-controlled coordination strategy is used to fabricate two CoFe PBA microcrystals with different morphologies, then two regular CoFe oxides are obtained via an intermediate-temperature calcination. CoFeS, a slow-speed coordination product with truncated microcube structure, contains less coordinated water and Fe3+ in its framework, but can create more mesopores and Fe3+ in its oxidative product of CoFeST300. CoFeST300 has been demonstrated to have higher adsorption capacity and affinity for phosphate adsorption compared to that of the fast-speed coordination product, due to its more Fe3+ as effective adsorption sites via ligand exchange. Besides, the inner-sphere complexation mechanism makes CoFeST300 high selectivity for phosphate removal compared to other co-existing anions. The application performance of CoFeST300 is examined by multiple continuous treatment of actual sewage, and the result of all effluent & nbsp; concentrations below 0.5 mg P/L verifies a promising potential of the fabricated adsorbent for phosphorus removal. Thus, design or regulation of the precursors is an efficiency method to fabricate an ideal metal oxide for phosphate adsorption. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Here, a heterogeneous interface is constructed, which binds a deprotonated carboxyl group on perylene diimide (PDI) photosensitizer to unsaturated metal sites generated by etching of different Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The atomically-dispersed metal sites and anchored photosensitive units greatly accelerate charge transfer. Typically, the S-scheme heterojunction built by etched NiCo PBA and PDI (NCSP) possesses bond of O-Ni. Density functional theory (DFT) and in-situ technology reveals the electron density of the Ni active site is optimized. Consequently, activation barrier of CO2 on the Ni site was reduced, thus improving the CO generation (60.0 mu mol g(- 1)) up to about 9 times than NiCo PBA.

The Alg-Zn-PBAs aqueous binder is fabricated via Zn2+ ion-induced co-precipitation reaction of PBAs nanoparticles and ionic crosslinking reaction of Alg-Zn network. The anchored PBAs nanoparticles can be formed around the Zn2+ ions and offer enhanced stability due to their strong supramolecular interactions to the Alg-Zn matrix. Consequently, the Si anodes using Alg-Zn-PBAs binder exhibits a capacity of 1372.9 mAh g(-1) for 200 cycles at 0.84 A g(-1) and a higher capacity when compared to electrodes fabricated by using Alg-Zn binder and Alg binder. This work demonstrates that the combination of PBAs and alginate via an one-step process of Zn2+ ions induced co-precipitation reaction is a better design of aqueous binders for lithium-ion batteries system with a green synthetic process.

J	Guo, F; Zhang, YZ; Cai, L; Li, LJ				Guo, Fan; Zhang, Yuze; Cai, Liang; Li, Lijuan			NiFe prussian blue analogue nanocages decorated magnesium hydroxide rod for enhancing fire safety and mechanical properties of epoxy resin	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING												Inspired by the structure of corn, a NiFe Prussian blue analogue nanocages decorated magnesium hydroxide composite was synthesized for the first time using magnesium hydroxide rods (RMH) as the "corn cob", a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as the "corn kernels" and polydopamine (PDA) as the membrane linking RMH and PBA. Subsequently, the RMH@PDA@PBA composite was introduced into epoxy resin (EP) to improve its fire retardancy and mechanical properties. The composition, structure and morphology of the RMH@PDA@PBA-incorporated EP composite were investigated. The tensile strength of EP with 3 wt.% RMH@PDA@PBA reached 41.77 MPa, which is higher than that of neat EP (40.51 MPa). The fire-retardant assessments illustrated that the limiting oxygen index and vertical burning tests (UL-94) of EP composite with 3 wt.% RMH@PDA@PBA progressed to 32.3% and the V-0 level as compared to those of virgin EP (24.4% and no rating). In addition, as compared to virgin EP, the peak heat release rate, peak smoke production rate, total heat release at 200 s and total smoke production at 200 s of EP/3RMH@PDA@PBA decreased by 43.1%, 50.0%, 43.9% and 56.3%, respectively. The investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that the flame retardancy and smoke suppression of EP/3RMH@PDA@PBA were attributed to the endothermic decomposition of RMH, "gauze barrier" mechanism of MgO/FeO, catalytic charring effect of Fe derivatives (MgO/FeO, FeNi3, Fe5C2, Fe2N, etc.) and free radical scavenging effect of PBA@Fe [III]. Thus, this study on bio-inspired hierarchical nanostructures paves a new pathway for the efficient production of fire-safe polymers.

In this work, the Fe-doped NiCoP/Prussian blue analog hollow porous nanocubes (Fe-NiCoP/PBA HNCs) were synthesized through a facile cation exchange of NiCo PBA HNCs followed by the phosphidation treatment. The optimal 2.5Fe-NiCoP/PBA HNCs exhibits a low OER overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good stability, which is superior to the reported PBA-derived OER electrocatalyst. This high OER activity can be ascribed to the synergy effects of interfacial structure of Fe-NiCoP and PBA as well as the hollow porous structures, which could improve the electron transfer rate, reduce the reaction kinetics and expose more active sites. This work underscores that formation of multiple active components derived from the PBA is an effective strategy for designing high performance OER catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a low-strain potassium-rich K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)(6)](0.88).0.49 H2O (KNiHCF) as a cathode material for PIBs. The as-prepared KNiHCF cathode can deliver reversible discharge capacity of 62.8 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), with a high discharge voltage of 3.82 V. It can also achieve a superior rate performance of 45.8 mAh g(-1) at 5000 mA g(-1), with a capacity retention of 88.6 % after 100 cycles.

In recent years, current research has focused on improving their conductivity and energy storage. In this paper, cobalt-manganese Prussian blue analogues (PBA) were hydrothermally synthesized as self-assembly on graphene oxide. The obtained intermediate was precisely heat-treated to produce Co-Mn oxide nanocages on reduced graphene oxide (Mn-Co oxide/rGO). The as-prepared composite was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX), Raman Spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis. It had been discovered that the interaction between the carbon and the Co-Mn Oxide not only prevents the agglomeration and significantly maximizes the surface, but also provides a network of conductive surface for quick electron transport resulting in an effective electrical transmission path and improved ionic absorbability and conductivity. The Mn-Co oxide @rGO nanocomposite delivers a maximum specific capacitance of 809 Cg(-1) in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at a high current density of 1 A g(-1). After 4000 cycles at 20 A g(-1) current density, the nanocomposite had preserved 86% of its starting capacitance. A two-electrode asymmetric cell (ASC) was designed and tested for electrochemical performance using Mn-Co oxide @ rGO as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. The designed device works excellently, with a maximum energy and power density of 55.55 Wh kg(-1) and 972.73 W kg(-1) in 1 A g(-1) , respectively.

Herein, Mo substituted Fe sites and S doped in inert PBA were designed and synthesized by hydrothermal method to enhance structural stability and OER activity. PBA-SMo/NF shows the optimum activity with a low overpotential of 252 and 294 mV for harvesting current density 20 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and exhibits excellent durability under high current density. Theoretical calculation of H2O adsorption energy and Bader charges reveals that Mo sites in PBA-SMo possess favourable H2O adsorption kinetics. More important, Gibbs free energy diagram and DOS show PBA-SMo have lower energy barriers for OER and better conductivity. This work provides a kind of guidance for the design and optimization of PBA for broad applications. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Herein, a vacancy and water-free silver hexacyanoferrate K0.95Ag3.05Fe(CN)(6) (AgHCF-3) was synthesized by adjusting the ratio of K and Ag in the framework. It offers nearly four electrons involving two sequential redox reactions, namely, Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ag+/Ag-0, to deliver a large capacity of 179.6 mAh g(-1) at 20 mA g(-1) with Coulomb efficiency of similar to 100 %. The Zn//AgHCF-3 cell delivers an estimated energy density of 200 Wh kg(-1), surpassing reported PBAs-based ZIBs. The formation of Ag-0 in the cycling process merits favorable rate performance of AgHCF-3 (156.4 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) with 80.3 % capacity retention after 100 cycles). This investigation paves new pathways for high-capacity PBA cathodes.

Photo-refining biomass is in line with current environmental protection strategies. However, photo-reforming biomass suffers from poor catalyst stability and low conversion efficiency. Here, we designed fructose as a lignocellulosic model. The heterogeneous structure of Prussian blue coating was constructed with a special covalent bond structure of Co-CN-Zn. This structure has a catalytic conversion mechanism that can accelerate electron transfer. Fructose was simultaneously converted to value-added platform compounds (5-HMF and formic acid) and gaseous fuels (CO, CH4) with a conversion rate of up to 92.5%, which is more than 1.7 times than that of catalysts without adding Prussian blue. Hydrogen transfer and carbon transfer on the carbon atoms of fructose facilitates the production and accelerates the spillover of CO from formic acid. This work provides new ideas for the development of Prussian blue catalysts and the conversion of pentose. image																				2567-3173				APR	2024	6	4								10.1002/eom2.12441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eom2.12441		FEB 2024											WOS:001176006900001

Herein, a series of trimetallic PBAs (Co/NiHCF with Co to Ni molar ratios of 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1) are synthesized by a facile co-precipitation method. In particular, the impact of Co to Ni molar ratio on the lithium storage and electrochromic properties of Co/NiHCF materials are systemically investigated. All five samples possess good crystallinity but the particle size decreases with the reduction of Co/Ni molar ratio. The color change, redox reaction potential, and lithium storage activity of the samples can be readily controlled by adjusting the molar ratio of Co to Ni. The lithium storage activity of the samples strengthens with the increase of Ni content in Co/NiHCF, accompanied by a decrease in redox potentials. With the increase of Ni content, the color of the Co/NiHCF film in the oxidation state changes from purple-red to orange, and finally to yellow; in the reduction state, the color of the film changes from green to light green and then to colorless. All the samples exhibit superior rate capability, excellent cycling stability, and short switching time (in the range of 1.6 to 4.3 s). The present work demonstrates a facile strategy for readily tunning the lithium storage activity, redox reaction potentials, and realizing rich color changes of PBA-based bifunctional materials.

The typical PB with perfect structure and highly integrated lattice has excellent structural stability, but the possible structural defects inevitably generated in the synthesis process will deteriorate its structure during cycling, resulting in rapid capacity degradation, and impede their practical application. However, not all defects are detrimental, as proper defect construction can customize the local nature of PB to achieve outstanding new functions. This paper reviews various defect engineering designs for PBAs, such as the creation/suppression of cation or anion vacancies, the introduction of cation doping, the reduction of dislocation defects, and the construction of pore-defect engineering. As a result, the structure-activity relationship between defects and electrochemical performance of SIBs is summarized. Moreover, the existing challenges and future development prospects are discussed, and the potential application of defect engineering in PBAs for SIBs is emphasized.

The viability of commercializing potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) is critically dependent on the availability of prepotassiated cathode materials, and the compatibility between the electrolyte and electrode components; which have yet to be fully explored. Herein, we report a Fe and Mn based K-rich Prussian Blue analogue, which can be used as the cathode of rechargeable KIBs to deliver 115 mAh/g of discharge capacity with two voltage plateaus at 3.9 and 4.1 V vs. K+/K in an electrolyte with fluoroethylene carbonate additive. In half-cell studies, the cyclability of this Prussian Blue analogue was found to depend on the formation of a passivation layer on the anode and the decomposition of the active electrode material at the cathode.

Prussian blue and its analogs ( Prussian blue analogs [PBAs]), or hexacyanoferrates, are well-known since the 18th century and have been used for hydrogen storage, cancer therapy, biosensing, seawater desalination, and sewage treatment. Owing to their unique features, PBAs are receiving increasing interest in the field of energy storage, such as their high theoretical specific capacity, ease of synthesis, as well as low cost. In this review, a general summary and evaluation of the applications of PBAs for rechargeable batteries are given. After a brief review of the history of PBAs, their crystal structure, nomenclature, synthesis, and working principle in rechargeable batteries are discussed.

However, the low energy density is the bottleneck limiting their wide application. Acquirement of high-performance super capacitors with ultrahigh energy density closed to batteries' is still a challenge. In this study, a mesoporous hollow Prussian blue analogues (PBA) nano-box/g-C3N4 hybrid was successfully synthesized. It shows excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity of 201.6 mAh g-1 and outstanding cycling stability (90.1% capacity retention after 5,000 cycles), which are significantly higher than those of most other PB/PBA based electrode materials.

Nevertheless, the lack of suitable cathode materials with high capacity hinders their practical applications. Recently, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) cathode materials stand out as promising candidates for PIBs. Their unique crystal structure with open 3D frameworks and large interstitial voids favors fast K+ intercalation without causing drastic volume expansion, which is the prerequisite for high-rate and long-term battery operation. Herein, a fundamental review on the development and advance of PBAs cathode materials is presented for PIBs with in-depth elucidation of their crystal structures, chemical compositions, and electrochemical performances. Particularly, the unique and prominent advantages of PBAs in both aqueous and nonaqueous PIBs are highlighted.

Four decades of electrochemical investigation of Prussian blue	IONICS												Prussian blue and its analogues are well known nowadays as promising substances for energy storage, capable of electrochemical insertion of Li+, Na+, Ca2+, and other ions. A huge amount of experimental data obtained recently is in evident contradiction with the postulates declared in the early investigations on Prussian blue electrochemistry. Nevertheless, some of these old postulates are widely in use up to now. On the basis of the data on the chemistry and the composition of the Prussian blue not previously involved in the discussion, this article examines the possible participation of hydrated ions in the redox process, the composition of the electrodeposited films of this compound, and some other important problems. Analytical data on Prussian blue, obtained in the nineteenth century and underestimated by twentieth century chemists, suggests that it is a non-stoichiometric compound. Equations describing electrochemical processes of this substance have been proposed.

The performance of the electrode was greatly influenced by the molar ratio of the two solvents (water and PC) in the electrolyte. The electrode exhibited a relatively high capacity when the molar ratio of calcium cations to water in the electrolyte was 1:6. In addition, the electrode exhibited a coulombic efficiency of similar to 100% over 800 cycles, with similar to 94% retention of the maximum capacity after 800 cycles in this electrolyte solution. Raman spectroscopy revealed that calcium cations were preferentially solvated by water molecules in the electrolyte, which is believed to be related to the improvement in electrode performance.

However, pure PBAs are prone to collapse and aggregate during pyrolysis, resulting in impedance mismatch that weaken the MA performance. Herein, the amorphous carbon layer with adjustable dielectric constant as the encapsulated layer, together with pyrolytic PBAs enables remarkable optimized performance via forming the classic yolk-shell structure. Specifically, the amorphous carbon obtained by quantitatively carbonizing phenolic resin, can not only avoid the collapse of pyrolytic PBAs but also optimize electromagnetic parameters to achieve optimum impedance matching by varying thickness. The NiFe alloys/graphite carbon core derived from pyrolytic NiFe-PBAs also enhance synergistic attenuation in the YS-NiFe/GC@C absorbers. According to experimental results, all YS-NiFe/GC@C absorbers exhibit impressive MA properties. When the thickness of the amorphous carbon shell is 50 nm, the minimum reflection loss value is as low as -56.3 dB and the maximum effective absorption bandwidth reaches 5.64 GHz, indicating that optimizing impedance matching via hierarchical and quantitative design can maximize the MA capability. The result is then verified by simulation calculations. Therefore, this promising work provides guidance for the sophisticated construction of tunable PBA-based MA materials.

This framework facilitates efficient exposure of the catalytically active sites and fast diffusion of the electrolyte. Additionally, the well-defined metal/semiconductor heterointerfaces result in an overall electrical conductivity enhancement and promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics by lowering the activation energy. Owing to the synergistic effect of Co and CoTe, the Co/CoTe heterostructure displays high electrocatalytic activity for OER, attaining an overpotential of 400 mV to deliver a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 94.1 mV dec(-1), which is superior to pure CoTe and Co counterparts. Furthermore, the Co/CoTe exhibits outstanding durability over 50 h without obvious change in alkaline media.

J	Feng, RF; Zhang, XY; Ye, F; Götelid, MA; Dutta, J				Feng, Rongfang; Zhang, Xingyan; Ye, Fei; Gotelid, Mats Ahmadi; Dutta, Joydeep			Microstructural engineering of high-entropy Prussian blue analogues for capacitive deionization of saline water	NANO ENERGY												Salt removal from seawater and brackish water by Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging technology that has a potential to contribute to solving global shortages of freshwater. Upon the application of an external voltage to a pair of nanostructured carbon electrodes, ions are removed by electrosorption in the electrical double layer (EDL) of the capacitor. The physical limitation due to repulsion of co-ions can be reduced using intercalation materials that are less sensitive to ion concentration variations. Herein, we report a hollow-concave high-entropy Prussian blue analogue (HEPBA) enhanced electrodes for superior electrochemical and capacitor performances. The half-cell of hollow-concave HEPBA has a high cycling stability of 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g(-1). Lower energy consumption for desalination estimated over 90 cycles is due to an enhancement of salt adsorption capacity of HEPBA (similar to 26.2 mg g(-1)). The observed improvement in the electrochemical property is due to synergistic effects from multi-elemental composition that lead to the high entropy and specific surface area.

Use of Screen-printed Electrodes Modified by Prussian Blue and Analogues in Sensing of Cysteine	ELECTROANALYSIS												The utilisation of screen-printing technology allows for a mass scalable approach for the production of electrochemical screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) and the presence of a redox mediator can add new possibilities to the electrochemical properties of the SPEs. Among the materials used as redox mediators, cyanidoferrates polymers can be used for electro-oxidation of cysteine. In this work, two monomers, namely, [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) and [Fe(CN)(5)NH3](3-) were used to produce Prussian blue (PB) and Prussian blue-Ammine (PB-Ammine), respectively. In addition, two modification methods were compared, firstly via a drop-casting and secondly by the incorporation of these materials into a printable ink. The SPE modified by PB-Ammine (drop-casting) exhibits the highest electroactive area, however the highest heterogeneous rate constant was found with the SPE modified by PB-Ammine that was incorporated into the ink. The highest value of the constant of electro-oxidation of cysteine and lowest limit of detection was also observed in the SPE modified by PB incorporated into the ink. These studies suggest that the electrocatalytic properties of SPE modified by PB and PB-Ammine are dependent upon the availability of Fe3+ catalytic sites and the increased kinetics of the chemical reaction between the catalytic sites and the analyte.

However, few reports explore how electrocatalytic performance of TMPs changed with the composition of the catalysts. We selected three different component Fe-based Prussian blue analogues (PBA) as precursors and transformed them into corresponding metal phosphides by simple heat treatment. By tuning the phosphidation temperature, a series of FeCoP, FeNiP, and FeMnP were obtained, in which FeCoP under a suitable phosphidation temperature at 400 degrees C exhibits most obviously porous structure and broadest distribution of pore size, which benefits for the mass transfer and oxygen release during OER. Besides, the charge-transfer resistance (R-ct) of TMPs has greatly decreased by introducing of Co in comparison of Ni and Mn, which accelerate the electron transport in OER. Due to the porous geometric structure and unique electronic structure, FeCoP-400 shows excellent and stable electrocatalytic activities of OER in 1 M KOH, with overpotentials of 261 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to commercial RuO2 and most OER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, FeCoP-400 exhibits outstanding stability with only 4% increase in potential during 24 h chronopotentiometry. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We prepared a Vana-dium-Iron Prussian blue analogue (V1/5Fe(CN)6 PBA) impregnated with insulin (INS), as a peroxidase-like mimetic probe toward 3,3 ' 5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) oxidation and colorimetric monitoring of fish freshness. A specific chemical reaction between putrescine as spoilage marker and the Vanadium-Iron V1/5Fe (CN)6PBA impregnated with insulin (V1/5Fe(CN)6PBA/INS) induces a decreasing peroxidase-like activity of the V1/5Fe(CN)6PBA/INS, generating lower amounts of oxidized products of TMB. The proposed bio-strategy ach-ieved highly sensitive responses in the range of 30 nM to 12 mu M toward putrescine with a detection limit of 9.0 nM and outstanding stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. The freshness of five different types of fish samples determined and produces a noticeable color change consistent with the stale fish around the 10 mu M, which can warn the oldness of the fish. This new strategy of integration between peptide and multi-metal PBA with intensified enzyme-like mimetics activity may be highly meaningful for thoroughly monitoring the amount of fish freshness.

The development of cathode materials for aqueous SIBs that have both high capacity and good cycling stability still remains a big challenge. This study proposes a high entropy strategy to boost both specific capacity and capacity retention by introducing equimolar Fe, Co, Mn, and Cu at the Ni sites in the Prussian blue analogue (PBA) frameworks. Attributing to the hybridization of 3d energy levels and improved valence electron concentration deriving from the exotic equimolar four transition metals, significantly increase the number of electrochemically active sites and raised the configuration entropy of PBA frameworks, contributing intensive valence electron transport to faster Faraday reaction and more stable hosts for Na+ ion (de)intercalation. Therefore, the high-entropy PBA (HE-PBA) cathode delivers an enhanced capacity of 118.6 mAh g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1, which is nearly 1.6 times higher than that of Ni-PBA, resulting in a high energy density of 74.8 Wh kg- 1. Moreover, the HE-PBA demonstrates stable operation over 1800 cycles at a high rate of 5 C. This high entropy strategy provides a feasible strategy for the practical application of aqueous SIBs.

The morphology and structure for Fe-Co Prussian blue nanocubes are controlled by fluoride etching resulting in the formation of the porous structure with a lot of defects/voids as characterized by a series of spectroscopic techniques. Iron-cobalt-fluoride nanocubes obtained at 400 degrees C possess the optimal porous structure and morphology to guarantee the channels for mass transportation and ion diffusion. The increased electrochemical surface area, more exposure of the active sites and facile construction of metal oxide layer over the catalyst surface make this novel catalyst very active for the water oxidation reaction. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate this catalyst can drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 250 mV with a Tafel slope of 38.3 mV dec(-1) and an excellent catalytic stability for 10 h in the long-term water electrolysis; the performance also outperforms most of the advanced analogous nonprecious catalysts and noble commercial IrO2 catalyst.

Here, we demonstrate a practical method to obtain FeNiOOH nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) as bifunctional electrocatalyst by growing a FeCo Prussian blue analog with further in situ oxidation under ambient conditions. The binder-free, self-standing FeNiOOH/NF electrode with hierarchical nanostructures requires low overpotentials of 260 mV and 240 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH solution. Therefore, an alkaline water electrolyzer constructed by bifunctional FeNiOOH/NF electrode as both anode and cathode delivers 50 mA cm(-2) under a cell voltage of 1.74 V with remarkable stability, which outperforms the IrO2-Pt/C-based electrolyzer. The excellent performance could be ascribed to the superior FeNiOOH intrinsic activity and the hierarchical structure. This work provides a cost-efficient surface engineering method to obtain binder-free, self-standing bifunctional electrocatalyst on commercial NF, which could be further extended to other energy and environment applications.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with a robust three-dimensional structure and extensive ion channels are highly favorable for Zn2+ insertion/extraction, surpassing manganese (Mn) and vanadium oxides. Herein, copper (Cu) substituted Mn PBA (CuMn PBA) composite nanostructures are synthesized via a simple water-based co-precipitation technique using different concentrations of Cu and Mn sources. The partial substitution of Cu and the formation of Mn vacancies prevent Jahn-Teller distortions of Mn-N-6 octahedra, extending the lifespan. The CuMn PBA-2 electrode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 175.14 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), superior rate capability of 89.08 mA h g(-1) at 2.4 A g(-1), and robust cycling stability, maintaining 73.15 mA h g(-1) over 2000 cycles at 3 A g(-1). Furthermore, the distinct structure provides numerous active sites and reduces volume volatility during cycling. The presence of Cu enhances electrode conductivity, thereby promoting a higher rate of Zn-ion diffusion between electrodes. The reversible intercalation and deintercalation of Zn2+ ions in the CuMn PBA-2 cathode are substantiated by ex-situ analysis methods.

However, challenges such as sluggish reaction kinetics of iodine (I2/I-), polyiodide dissolution and the "shuttle effect" impede their widespread industrialization. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have emerged as promising hosts for iodine, but transition metal ions dissolution in aqueous electrolytes undermines PBAs stability, leading to structural degradation and diminished electrochemical performance. Herein, we propose a dual-transformation strategy: the phase transition of MnFe-PBA to ZnFe-PBA and the morphological transition from nanocubes to nanosheets, aiming to achieve enhanced stability and wettability. The Mn2+ ions within MnFe-PBA dissolve into the electrolyte, creating vacancies that are subsequently occupied by Zn2+ ions from the electrolyte, thereby forming stable ZnFe-PBA nanosheets. These transformed ZnFe-PBA nanosheets serve as hosts for I2 and facilitate I2/I- redox reactions while provide additional capacity. The transformed ZnFe-PBA/I2//Zn battery achieves a high capacity of 250mAh/g at 0.5 A/g and remains at 190 mAh/g after 1200 cycles. At high current density (5 A/g), this battery still delivers a capacity of 100 mAh/g after 21000 cycles, showing excellent cyclic stability.

At present, the main research object of trivalent metals is aqueous aluminum-ion batteries (AAIBs). However, the high charge carried by Al3+ ions results in strong electrostatic interactions during intercalation and deintercalation of the host material. The host material structure is unstable, resulting in poor cycling performance, slow ion diffusion kinetics, and a low power output. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have become a promising electrode material for aqueous rechargeable batteries due to their high stability. Herein, we synthesized one-dimensional (1D) CoPBA as an innovative and high-performance cathode material for the AAIBs is reported. As a result of the unique anisotropic properties, 1D-CoPBA can provide fast axial electron transfer and short ion diffusion paths, which results in lower resistance and better contact with the electrolyte.

K.; Lin, Kun-Yi Andrew			A comparative study of hexacyanoferrate-based Prussian blue analogue nanocrystals for catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY												Catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) represents a useful method of converting 4-NP into a more environmentally friendly product, 4-aminophenol (4-AP). Prussian blue (PB) (Fe-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)) and its Prussian blue Analogues (PBAs) (M-II[Fe(CN)(6)] PBAs (M-II = Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn) exhibit hierarchical porous structures, and electrochemical characteristics, making PBAs promising catalysts for 4-NP reduction. Nevertheless, very few literatures report the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP employing PBAs, and no studies have been ever conducted to evaluate the effects of different M-II species of [Fe(CN)(6)]-based PBAs on the catalytic conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP. Herein, we examine the catalytic reductive performance of various (M-II[Fe(CN)(6)] PBAs (M-II = Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn), in the presence of sodium borohydride (NaBH4), on 4-NP reduction to 4-AP. The catalytic activity of PBAs for 4-NP reduction was in the order CoFeCN > NiFeCN > FeFeCN > MnFeCN > ZnFeCN. The corresponding activation energies are determined as 32, 43, 46, 47, and 54 kJ/mol for CoFeCN, NiFeCN, MnFeCN, FeFeCN and ZnFeCN, respectively. Especially, CoFeCN shows the highest catalytic activity with a rate constant of 0.457 min(-1) and a calculated turnover frequency of 6.3 x 10(-3)s(-1), which are higher than many reported noble metal catalysts because of its high surface area and catalytic activities towards hydrogen generation and hydrogenation. CoFeCN (and NiFeCN) also exhibit excellent reusabilities even after 6 consecutive reduction experiments. These findings demonstrate that PBAs, such as CoFeCN and NiFeCN, are highly advantageous catalysts for reduction of 4-NP and would be promising for reducing other nitro-aromatic compounds.

Structural analysis shows that the Co-3(Co(CN)(6))(2) nanoparticles were highly dispersed and inlaid on surface of GC nanosheets with outstanding structural stability. The GC/Co-3(Co(CN)(6))(2)/Pd electrocatalyst exhibits significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards ethanol oxidation with a maximum mass activity of 2644 A g(-1) Pd GC/Pd, which is more than double that of GC/Pd electrocatalyst (1249 A g(-1)). Excellent electrochemical stability is also demonstrated for this GC/Co-3(Co(CN)(6))(2)/Pd electrocatalyst. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic effects of GC support and Co-3(Co(CN)(6))(2) promoter on the Pd electrocatalysts, in which Co-3(Co(CN)(6))(2) acts as a co-catalyst and GC acts as a conductive support.

CuFe PBA NCs produce an absorption peak at 400 nm. In the presence of GSH, the CuFe PBA NCs were transformed into larger hollow nanospheres based on the acid-initiated Kirkendall effect, leading to the appearance of a new peak at 520 nm and a solution color change from yellow to red. Thus, the GSH-induced color changes allowed the establishment of a double-signal colorimetric assay for GSH using the ratio of absorbance at 520 and 400 nm (Delta(A520/A400)). Facile determination of GSH from 0.1 to 8 mu M with satisfactory specificity was developed, providing a detection limit as low as 0.08 mu M. Additionally, GSH concentrations exceeding 3 mu M can be directly identified by the naked eye. The colorimetric assay for GSH has also been demonstrated to have application for serum analysis. Compared with conventional single-signal colorimetric determination, the ratiometric probe was demonstrated to provide good selectivity and high sensitivity.

Vacancies can create active unsaturated coordination, regulate the electronic structure, and enhance the charge transfer efficiency to improve both the intrinsic and extrinsic catalytic activities. This work aims to construct an efficient OER electrocatalyst through precise control of the C=N vacancies (VC=N) in NiFe- and NiCo-Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) leading to outstanding OER characteristics and improved energy conversion efficiency. The amount of VC=N has been regulated precisely via thermal treatment. The electronic interactions occur between Ni and Fe sites during the introduction of VC=N. As a result, the synergistic effects of Ni-Fe electronic interactions and VC=N lead to outstanding OER characteristics such as a small overpotential of 270 mV to achieve a high current density of 50 mA cm-2 as well as excellent stability over 80 h, which are better than those of the pristine PBAs electrocatalyst. The results demonstrate a precise strategy to produce VC=N in PBAs-based electrocatalysts for advanced OER and efficient hydrogen production.

Typically, PBAs are synthesized in an aqueous environment through the instantaneous reaction of transition metal ions with ferrocyanide ions, resulting in the inclusion of water in the lattice and the induction of Fe vacancies. These defects decrease the rate capability of the synthesized material; therefore, the principles behind their formation must be comprehensively elucidated to maximize the performance of synthesized PBAs. This review describes various PBA synthesis methods and explores the principles behind defect formation in materials specific to each synthesis technique. Additionally, the mechanism through which crystal structure and morphology determine the rate capability of PBAs is discussed. This review also examines critical factors affecting kinetics and discusses strategies for improving rate capability and mitigating performance degradation. Elucidation of the changes in material parameters due to synthesis processes and conditions is crucial for increasing the rate capability of PBA materials.

Rapid precipitation may lead to a large number of vacancies and a large amount of interstitial water in the material, resulting in poor electrochemical performance in batteries. Hence, sodium citrate is used to compete with [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) to slow down the coordination rates of Ni2+ and Mn2+ ions with ferrous cyanide ions. The feasibility of the experiment is also confirmed by theoretical analysis. Benefiting from stable crystal structure and the removal of interstitial water, the as-prepared Na2NixMnyFe(CN)(6) sample exhibits a high reversible capacity of 150 mA h g(-1). In addition, a high rate performance of 77 mA h g(-1) is achieved at a current density of 1600 mA g(-1). Most noteworthy, the Coulombic efficiency and specific capacity gradually increase in the first few cycles, which can be ascribed to the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the electrode. Continuous testing in an electrolyte solution of 1 M NaPF6 dissolved in sulfone reveals that the presence of a passivation film is very important for the stability of the electrode.

Through the pyrolysis treatment, a series of Cu/Co-Co PBA derivatives were prepared and used as catalysts for the epoxidation of styrene. Cu/Co-Co PBA-250, obtained by slow pyrolysis at 250 degrees C, showed the highest catalytic performance for the epoxidation of styrene, with 99% of styrene conversion. The superior catalytic performance is responsible for its large specific surface area and abundant metal active sites which generated by cyano vacancies. Meanwhile, the face-centered cubic structure and the confinement effects of CN- on metal cations were still maintain during the pyrolysis process. The DFT and control experiment confirmed that tBuOO center dot radical was the active species responsible for epoxidation of styrene and the convert of Cu2+ to Cu+ may be an important reason for its excellent selectivity.																			0926-860X	1873-3875				MAY 5	2023	657								119161	10.1016/j.apcata.2023.119161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcata.2023.119161		MAR 2023											WOS:001014377600001

Here, we present the synthesis of Prussian blue nanoplates designed for use as high performance cathode materials in potassium-ion batteries. Prussian blue nanoplates were synthesized through a facile solution precipitation route using a highly concentrated potassium citrate solution. The potassium-rich environment during the synthesis facilitated horizontal growth of the crystals, yielding potassium-rich Prussian blue nanoplates. The resultant Prussian blue nanoplates exhibited a significantly larger particle size of 600 nm and a reduced specific surface area of 6.8 m2 g-1, compared to conventionally synthesized Prussian blue hexahedrons. Half-cell tests demonstrated that the Prussian blue nanoplates exhibited a high gravimetric capacity of 152.5 mAh g-1 with a nominal voltage 3.952 V at a C-rate of 0.1 C, yielding an energy density of 602.7 Wh kg-1. Cycling tests demonstrated high cycling stability of the material, maintaining a capacity of 122.7 mAh g-1 and a nominal voltage of 3.923 V after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. In a full-cell configuration with graphite anodes, a gravimetric capacity changed from 134.1 mAh g-1 to 108.9 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, demonstrating a good cycling stability. This work provides a new insight into the electrochemical properties of Prussian blue nanoplates and highlights their potential as high-performance cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries.

However, unsatisfactory structural stability upon excessive sodium storage and long-term cycling is still a bottleneck in industrial applications. Herein, a two-pronged approach of single-crystal and high-entropy PBA (SC-HEPBA), is first reported to solve this challenge simultaneously from the bulk phase and interface. The nature of high entropy enables the unrestricted Na+ diffusion and the suppressed metal dissolution, while the micrometer-sized single crystals help to improve the tap density with less structural degradation upon cycling. As a result, the Na-rich SC-HEPBA with an intact monoclinic crystal structure delivers a high capacity of 115 mAh g- 1 at 100 mA g- 1, outstanding rate performance (i.e. 74.4 mAh g- 1 at 3000 mA g- 1) and good capacity retention (79.6%) over 1000 cycles with a stable operating voltage of 3.25 V.

In this study, FeCo Prussian blue analogue (PBA) hierarchical cubic arrays (FeCo PBA HCAs) grown on carbon fiber cloth were first used as electrocatalysts for NO3-RR in the neutral electrolyte of phosphate buffer solution, and satisfactory yield rate (1788.4 & mu;g h(-1) cm(-2)) and Faradaic efficiency toward NH3 (81.01%) were achieved. Electrochemical results and operando Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the cyanide group is crucial for improving the catalytic activity. The frontier orbital theory was first employed to study the NO3-RR process and revealed that the cyanide group could upshift the highest occupied state (equals to the highest occupied molecular orbital) of the catalyst, which facilitates the electron injection to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of nitrate, and thus optimizes the Gibbs free energy of adsorbed intermediates and eventually promotes the NO3-RR process.

In this study, we report Co-Ni co-doped PBA, with different Co and Ni ratios with high purity and crystallinity as cathode materials for AZIBs. Moreover, different low-cost porous water-based separators are proposed in conjunction with Co-Ni co-doped PBA cathodes. The studies on Zn||Zn symmetric cell show that nitrocellulose membrane (NC) separator can operate over 2000 h with lower hysteresis voltage of 90 mV and considerably decreases the dendrite grown on the Zn-metal surface due to the uniform pore size distribution. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of bimetallic doping and Zn dendrite inhibition ability from NC separator, the aqueous K1.9Co0.67Ni0.33[Fe(CN)6].1.7H2O||Zn cell is able to display excellent cycling performance of 5000 cycles at 1 A g-1 with a maximum capacity retention of 84 %. This research not only demonstrates the considerable effect of bimetallic doping on the Zn storage performance of PBA cathodes, but it also discloses the influence of separator on the zinc striping/plating process, which will provide insights into the development of high-performance AZIBs.

Achieving High OER Performance by Tuning the Co/Mn Content in Prussian Blue Analogues	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES												The need for efficient, economical, and clean energy systems is increasing, and as a result, interest in water-splitting techniques to produce green hydrogen is also increasing. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinders the practical application and widespread use of water-splitting technologies; therefore, to address this challenge, it is essential to develop cost-effective and efficient OER catalysts. In this work, we have synthesized an inexpensive and tunable FeCoMn Prussian blue analogue (PBAs) as an efficient OER catalyst via a straightforward process. The ratio of the Co and Mn to optimize the electrochemical performance, and as a result, the FeCo0.41Mn0.42 PBA catalyst demonstrated the best electrochemical performance (260/304 mV overpotential at 10/50 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) and a good stability of 72 h at 10 mA cm(-2)). Additionally, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the FeCo0.41Mn0.42 PBA possesses the optimized electronic density distribution at the active site (Co), and the doping of Mn and Fe can not only increase the electricity conductivity but also activate the critical H2O deprotonation step.

Developing high-capacity and highly reliable cathode materials is key to advancing the commercialization of SIBs and PIBs. Low-cost Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), with their open 3D framework and ease of synthesis, are preferred cathode materials for energy storage applications. However, the unique growth mechanism of PBAs introduces numerous Fe(CN)6 vacancies, which compromise structural integrity and result in capacity decay due to structural collapse during long-term electrochemical cycling. Additionally, cracking can cause the dissolution of transition metal (TM) ions, undesirable interfacial reactions, and gas generation, which shorten the battery's lifespan and raise safety concerns. In this review, the mechanisms of growth and vacancy formation in PBAs is first clarified, providing a comprehensive overview of current strategies for vacancy remediation based on both bottom-up and top-down approaches. It is then elucidate how optimized vacancy remediation mechanisms can enhance lattice and interfacial stability, suppress TM dissolution and mitigate gas generation. Finally, it is discussed future research directions and provide perspectives on the further development of high-performance cathode materials for SIBs and PIBs.					wang, xianda/KBB-5444-2024; Lin, Jie/JVD-7290-2023; YANG, HUI YING/B-5458-2011	YANG, HUI YING/0000-0002-2244-8231													1616-301X	1616-3028				MAR	2025	35	13								10.1002/adfm.202418018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202418018		DEC 2024											WOS:001380712200001

Up till now, there are few studies explored chemical detection methods for these stable pesticides. Here, we reported a novel chemosensor system and polymer materials for highly sensitive detection of imidacloprid pesticide. The polymer monolith with tunable surface hydrophilicity allows solvent-dependent adsorption of low-abundance target pesticide molecule. Prussian blue particles with Fenton catalytic activity were introduced into the polymeric monolith through Pickering emulsion, which capable of degrading the pesticide adsorbed on the column surface into easily detectable ions (NO3-, Cl-). This all-in-one functional material can minimize the interference of other non-target molecules through dual-channel detection, enabling sensitive detection of imidacloprid pesticide (30 ppb). We believe that the material described in this paper demonstrates for the first time the combination of an active polymer monolith for the enrichment and catalytic degradation with sensitive detection of pesticides, and this protocol can be used to develop a range of pesticides chemical sensing methods in the future.

Exploring high mass loading and additive-free electrodes is of huge significance to develop advanced supercapacitors with commercial application prospects, which still remains challenging. Herein, high mass loading CoFe-prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) electrodes are developed by a facile co-precipitation method using activated carbon cloth (ACC) as the flexible substrate. The homogeneous nanocube structure, large specific surface area (143.9 m2 g-1) and appropriate pore size distribution (3.4 nm) of the CoFe-PBA endow the as-prepared CoFe-PBA/ACC electrodes with low resistance and appealing ion diffusion characteristics. Typically, the high areal capacitance (1155.0 mF cm-2 at 0.5 mA cm-2) is obtained for high mass loading CoFe-PBA/ACC electrodes (9.7 mg cm-2). Furthermore, symmetrical flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) are constructed using CoFe-PBA/ACC electrodes and Na2SO4/polyving alcohol (Na2SO4/ PVA) gel electrolyte, achieving superior stability (85.6% capacitance retention after 5,000 cycles), maximum energy density of 33.8 & mu;Wh cm-2 at 200.0 & mu;W cm-2 and promising mechanical flexibility.

In this work, a serious of shape-specific Fe/Co Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), including concave, core-shell and polygonal cubes were prepared by the one-step hydrothermal reaction, which were altered by adjusting the ratio of Fe/Co in the initial reaction system. The catalytic performance toward bisphenol A (BPA) degradation was significantly affected by the ultimate structure and Fe/Co composition. Benefiting from appropriate elemental proportions, unique elemental distribution (rich Co in the core and rich Fe in the shell) and high specific surface areas, the core-shell PBAs (CSPs) exhibits significantly higher peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation performance toward bisphenol A (BPA) degradation (96 % of removal efficiency within 2 min). The stability of the CSPs catalyst test further indicates that the Fe shell can effectively protect and inhibit the leaching of cobalt ions. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical quenching experiments measurement exhibited that both SO4 center dot- and (OH)-O-center dot are the main active species in the degradation process.

However, their large ion radius might lead to stress and structural degradation, resulting in worse rate performance and cycle stability, especially at low temperatures. In this work, a Cs+/Zn2+ co-doping strategy is proposed to increase the performance at low temperature of -20 degrees C for the first time. The doped Cs+/Zn2+ ions have a vital role in lowering interstitial water content in PBA, resulting in improved diffusion dynamics of Na+ ions and greatly enhancing cyclic stability at temperature as low as -20 degrees C. The half cells made from PBA with an optimized Cs+/Zn2+ concentration exhibited excellent performance, retaining 79.63 % of the capacity after 5400 cycles at a low temperature of -20 degrees C and a current density of 5C. The results indicate that the Cs+/Zn2+ co-doped Fe-PB cathode material shows extraordinary performance at low temperature, which holds significant practical importance for promoting low-temperature SIB technology.

Then both synthesized KMnHCF and MnHCF are applied as anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The KMnHCF anode exhibits a super electrochemical performance than MnHCF. It shows a very low discharge voltage plateau of 0.6 V, an initial capacity of 777 mAh g(-1), and a reversible capacity of 434 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g(-1). Furthermore, it keeps 425 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) and 215 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles even at 500 mA g(-1).

Experimental and theoretical approaches were combined in order to better understand the microscopic mechanisms ruling their different sorption properties. It was first demonstrated that amongst the three materials investigated, ZIF-8 was the most hydrophobic, whereas the PBA was more hydrophilic. In terms of sorption capacities, Cu-BTC is highly efficient for adsorption of the investigated hydrocarbons with large adsorption capacities (150 mg.g(-1)), however, it has proven unstable in the presence of water and cannot be used for humid hydrocarbons adsorption and separation. n-Hexane is preferentially adsorbed (250 mg.g(-1) at saturation) in the hydrophobic ZIF-8, whereas cyclohexene is not, due to the size of the windows. Even if ZIF-8 did not adsorb water, its porosity decreased in the presence of water. On the contrary, CoCo is stable in humid conditions and even if its sorption capacity is lower than that found for the other MOFs investigated, it seems more appropriate for humid hydrocarbons sorption or separation.					guari, yannick/C-5015-2018; Larionova, Joulia/T-8900-2019; Long, Jérôme/AAK-2994-2021; TRENS, Philippe/B-7893-2018; SALLES, Fabrice/G-3881-2017; lotfi, boudjema/KVB-4727-2024	SALLES, Fabrice/0000-0001-8069-533X; Larionova, Joulia/0000-0002-3279-9158; lotfi, boudjema/0000-0003-1099-0004													0020-1693	1873-3255				FEB 1	2020	501								119316	10.1016/j.ica.2019.119316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ica.2019.119316													WOS:000504763300041

Yet, the desalination performance of the currently reported PBA-based CDI system falls far short of practical applications. Herein, the NiCoFe-PBA/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite is finely customized by a synergistic strategy of doping the Ni2+ into the CoFe-PBA and further employing conductive CNT as the interconnected framework for in-situ growth of NiCoFe-PBA particles, endowing the composite with excellent electrical conductivity, abundant redox-active sites, and structural stability. Moreover, we further coupled the NiCoFe-PBA/CNT composite with the rocking-chair CDI (RCDI) cell to avoid the capacity mismatch between the cathode and anode. As a result, the NiCoFe-PBA/CNT-based RCDI system achieves a high desalination capacity of 140.8 mg g-1 and a superior desalination rate of 0.51 mg g-1 s-1, which outperform most current PBA-based systems and are comparable to current state-of-the-art CDI systems. Besides, the system also exhibits excellent stability with almost no capacity degradation over 40 desalination cycles. This work highlights the importance of meticulous electrode material design and strategic CDI configurations in overcoming CDI bottlenecks, offering valuable insights for the advancement of future high-performance desalination systems.

J	Zentkova, M; Mihalik, M				Zentkova, Maria; Mihalik, Marian			The Effect of Pressure on Magnetic Properties of Prussian Blue Analogues	CRYSTALS												We present the review of pressure effect on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of Cr(CN)(6)-based Prussian blue analogues (PBs). The lattice volume of the fcc crystal structure space group Fm (3) over barm in the Mn-Cr-CN-PBs linearly decreases for p <= 1.7 GPa, the change of lattice size levels off at 3.2 GPa, and above 4.2 GPa an amorphous-like structure appears. The crystal structure recovers after removal of pressure as high as 4.5 GPa. The effect of pressure on magnetic properties follows the non-monotonous pressure dependence of the crystal lattice. The amorphous like structure is accompanied with reduction of the Curie temperature (T-C) to zero and a corresponding collapse of the ferrimagnetic moment at 10 GPa. The cell volume of Ni-Cr-CN-PBs decreases linearly and is isotropic in the range of 03.1 GPa. The Raman spectra can indicate a weak linkage isomerisation induced by pressure. The Curie temperature in Mn2+-Cr-III-PBs and Cr2+-Cr-III-PBs with dominant antiferromagnetic super-exchange interaction increases with pressure in comparison with decrease of T-C in Ni2+-Cr-III-PBs and Co2+-Cr-III-PBs ferromagnets. T-C increases with increasing pressure for ferrimagnetic systems due to the strengthening of magnetic interaction because pressure, which enlarges the monoelectronic overlap integral S and energy gap Delta between the mixed molecular orbitals. The reduction of bonding angles between magnetic ions connected by the CN group leads to a small decrease of magnetic coupling. Such a reduction can be expected on both compounds with ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic ordering. In the second case this effect is masked by the increase of coupling caused by the enlarged overlap between magnetic orbitals. In the case of mixed ferroferromagnetic systems, pressure affects mu(T) by a different method in Mn2+-N equivalent to C-Cr-III subsystem and Cr-III-C equivalent to N-Ni2+ subsystem, and as a consequence T-comp decreases when the pressure is applied. The pressure changes magnetization processes in both systems, but we expect that spontaneous magnetization is not affected in Mn2+-Cr-III-PBs, Ni2+-Cr-III-PBs, and Co2+-Cr-III-PBs. Pressure-induced magnetic hardening is attributed to a change in magneto-crystalline anisotropy induced by pressure. The applied pressure reduces saturated magnetization of Cr2+-Cr-III-PBs. The applied pressure p = 0.84 GPa induces high spin-low spin transition of cca 4.5% of high spin Cr2+. The pressure effect on magnetic properties of PBs nano powders and core-shell heterostructures follows tendencies known from bulk parent PBs.

In this work, the Cu-PBAs grow in-situ on Titanium (Ti) net, and then the Cu3P and Fe2P materials (Cu-Fe-P/TiN) is prepared with subsequent phosphorization, which can be used as binder-free and conductive agent-free anode for sodium-ion batteries. And the Cu-Fe-P is closely linked with Ti net to form a conductive network by regular rod-like par-ticles, which contributes to the excellent electrochemical performance. The Cu-Fe-P/TiN can deliver a high reversible capacity of more than 180 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, and achieve a capacity retention rate of 70% after 100 cycles. At areal current density of 1 mA cm-2, the reversible capacity of the Cu-Fe-P/TiN electrode is 1.6 mAh cm-2. The reversible transformation and sodium storage mechanism are further revealed by in-situ characterizations.

The unique three-dimensional layered structure gives RGOA/TPBAs excellent mechanical strength and high-level specific surface area, which facilitates the exposure of adsorption points and thus promotes the adsorption of Cs+. A maximum adsorption capacity of 226.98 mg g(-1) (dosage = 0.25 g L-1, pH = 7, T = 298.15 K) was obtained for the composite material, which exhibited excellent adsorption performance for cesium. In addition, RGOA/TPBAs maintained an excellent Cs+ selectivity in a solution containing other ions (m V-1 = 0.25 g L-1, Mn+ = Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, [Cs+]initial = 10 mg L-1) and the removal rate is more than 90%.

Here, we developed a new adsorptive membrane by immobilizing bimetal (cobalt and iron) Prussian blue analogues (Co@Fe-PBAs) on a polytetrafluoroethylene microporous membrane (Co@Fe-PBAs-M). The prepared membrane displayed precise adsorption of trace Tl+ (50 mu g/L) from complex water. A variety of interfering factors, such as water pH, competitive adsorption of positive ions (Na+ and K+) and negative ions (CO32- and PO43-), natural organic matters (e.g., fulvic acid and bovine serum albumin) were evaluated during Tl removal. The composite membrane showed high removal efficiency (over 80 %) during long-term dynamic membrane separation of surface water containing super trace Tl+ (<2.0 mu g/L), breaking through the adsorption limitation in ultralow concentration of Tl+. The unique bimetal electron transfer of Co@Fe-PBAs-M reinforced the adsorptive performance to Tl+ through dual ion exchange and intercalation. In the treatment of real Pearl River water containing 0.5 mu g/L of Tl+, our membrane effectively reduced the Tl+ concentration to 0.04 mu g/L during 6-h continuous separation, which was far below the required level for drinking water (i.e., 0.1 mu g/L). This work offers a promising solution for safe drinking water by remedying ultralow Tl+ contaminated surface water.

In this study, we report a facile one-step fabrication of cationic surfactant-assisted Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) M-x[Fe(CN)(5)CH3C6H4NH2]center dot yC(19)H(34)NBr abbreviated as SF[Fe-Tol-M] (where SF = N-tridecyl-3-methylpyridinium bromide and M = Mn, Co and Ni) as efficient heterogeneous OER electrocatalysts. The electrocatalysts have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the presence of cationic surfactant (SF), PBAs-based electrodes showed enhanced redox current, high surface area and robust stability compared to the recently reported PBAs. SF[Fe-Tol-Co] hybrid catalyst shows superior electrochemical OER activity with a much lower over-potential (610 mV) to attain the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with the Tafel slope value of 103 mV center dot dec(-1) than that for SF[Fe-Tol-Ni] and SF[Fe-Tol-Mn]. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) unveiled that SF[Fe-Tol-Co] exhibits smaller charge transfer resistance, which results in a faster kinetics towards OER. Furthermore, SF[Fe-Tol-Co] offered excellent stability for continues oxygen production over extended reaction time. This work provides a surface assisted facile electrode fabrication approach for developing binder-free OER electrocatalysts for efficient water oxidation.

Therefore, we introduced chelating agent of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium salt to synthesize PBAs with FeIII vacancies, which has been demonstrated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation X ray absorption spectrum. Our calculation suggests that the FeIII vacancies in PBAs can inhibit the movement of the Fe-C bond. This behavior helps to reduce the lattice distortion of Fe-C octahedron, in favour of the high reversibility and cycling stability of PBAs. After treatments, our specimens present a high initial Coulomb efficiency of 97% with a discharge capacity of 66 mAh g-1 at 25 mA g-1 after 50 cycles and a stable discharge capacity of 40 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 250 cycles.

Herein, a unique discharging plateau elevation was firstly determined in the iron hexa-cyanoferrate. The synergy between the crystal field and ligand field stabilization energy in the OH-coordinated Fe sites lowers the activation energy barrier of low-spin Fe, thus inducing the intercalation pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, we prove that the Na' storage mechanism of high-spin Fe redox reaction features an ion-diffusion behavior while the low-spin Fe redox reaction shows a pseudocapacitance behavior. Benefitting from the improved ionic diffusivity in intercalation pseudocapacitance, the full cell achieves an outstanding rate performance and long-term cycling stability of over 3000 cycles at 500 mA g(-1). It is expected that manipulating Fe redox kinetics of the PBAs through inducing special coordinated groups could be a new pathway towards the design of practical high-voltage SIBs.

The influences of calcination tem-perature and the molar ratio of Fe/Mn in precursor were investigated. Mn-Fe-CN obtained by calcining Mn-Fe PBAs precursors with Fe/Mn molar ratio of 0.5 at 700 degrees C exhibited high activity for degradation of rhoda-mine b (RhB) by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Acid etching achieved higher catalytic activity by removing excessive agglomerated metals generated during pyrolysis process and exposing more catalytic active sites in the catalyst. Fe, Mn and N-doped carbon were the active sites of the catalyst. In the Mn-Fe-CN/PMS/ RhB system, there was a redox cycle between Fe and Mn with multivalent states.

However, unraveling the dopant selection principles is still a big challenge. Herein, the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) function is adopted to evaluate the strength of chemical bonds of N-transition metals (N-TM) and guide the dopant selection. Among the series of ICOHP values for N-TM (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), the Cu & horbar;N bond exhibits the lowest ICOHP value, which indicates that Cu doping can improve the stability of PBAs compared to other dopants. Experimentally, among TM-substituted Fe-based PBAs (TMFeHCFs), the as-prepared sample with 20 at.% Cu doping (CuFeHCF-2) exhibits the best cycling performance, with a capacity retention of 83.5% after 400 cycles at 1 C, which is consistent with the theoretical calculation results. In addition, in situ XRD and in situ, Raman reveal a highly reversible monoclinic-cubic two-phase conversion and redox-active pairs, respectively. This study provides valuable guidelines for dopant selection to enhance the performance of PBAs cathodes. Systematically theoretical calculations are performed to seek the optimal transition metals dopant to improve the stability of PBAs. Based on theoretical results, the as-prepared sample with 20 at.% Cu doping (CuFeHCF-2) exhibits superior electrochemical performance. image					Rui, Xianhong/D-2604-2015; Li, Weihan/D-7815-2016; Yu, Yan/C-7031-2012; Yao, Yu/GOH-3010-2022; Yang, Hai/LSL-6899-2024; Yu, Yan/ABY-4357-2022; Wu, Xiaojun/F-1619-2010	Yao, Yu/0000-0003-1000-1878; Yang, Hai/0009-0003-4190-4129; Li, Weihan/0000-0002-5768-9641; Yu, Yan/0000-0002-3685-7773; Wu, Xiaojun/0000-0003-3606-1211													1614-6832	1614-6840				AUG	2024	14	29								10.1002/aenm.202401729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202401729		MAY 2024											WOS:001220257200001

However, their use in the emerging two-electron oxygen reduction reaction for clean production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is lagging. Herein, a general solvent exchange induced reconstruction strategy is demonstrated, through which an abnormal NiNi-PBA superstructure is synthesized as a high-performance electrocatalyst for H2O2 generation. The resultant NiNi-PBA superstructure has a stoichiometric composition with saturated lattice water, and a leaf-like morphology composed of interconnected small-size nanosheets with identical orientation and predominate {210} side surface exposure. Our studies show that the Ni-N centers on {210} facets are the active sites, and the saturated lattice H2O favors a six-coordinated environment that results in high selectivity.

But poor electrical conductivity and deformation of crystal structure during the desalination process restrict its development. To enhance the stability of PBA and provide rapid charge transfer, a new composite hollow core-shell polyaniline-encapsuled Ni-Prussian blue analogue (H-NP@PANI) is constructed. Experiments illustrate that PANI formed an omnidirectional uniform and highly conductive layer on the crystal surface, which tremendously improved the electrochemical capacity of H-NP@PANI (242.24 F center dot g(-1)). In constant voltage mode, the adsorption capacity of ACH-NP@PANI cell is 35.86 mg center dot g(-1), which was the highest to H-NP (20.82 mg center dot g(-1)) and pure Ni-PBA (16.08 mg center dot g(-1)). The retention rate remains 96.1 % after 50 cycles. XRD tests show that superior cycle stability is due to the hollow structure and buffer space provided by PANI shell, which can effectively inhibit the degree of crystal transformation. Furthermore, DFT calculation confirms the existence of a highly stable tight electron coupling between H-NP and PANI, and the electron aggregation center around Fe atom facilitates the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycle. Hence, this work can provide a feasible strategy for designing stable and efficient electrodes.

Representative zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) nanocubes were successfully synthesized in a microfluidic reactor within a few minutes via the cooperation method and possessed lower contents of crystal water and Fe(CN)63- vacancies than that of synthesis in bulk solution. The nucleation and particle growth process can be precisely controlled by the exploration of different flow rates and reaction temperatures during the formation of ZnHCF nanocubes in segmented flow microfluidic reactors. High crystallinity, low crystal water and vacancies in the ZnHCF structure were presented at relatively high temperatures for the crystal growth process. High-quality ZnHCF with a low content of crystal water showed excellent electrochemical activity and stability towards zinc-ion storage. The continuous and scalable synthesis approach can be extended to the fabrication of other PBAs such as NiHCF, CoHCF, MnHCF, and CuHCF with high dispersity without using any surfactants. The controllable construction of PBAs with tunable properties in microfluidic reactors provides a promising direction to minimize the gap between commercial reality and laboratory research. A segmented flow surfactant-free microfluidic strategy for continuous synthesis of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with high dispersity and high crystallization was exploited.

We show that no light is actually needed to induce a selective degradation of the molecular target, while light irradiation spurs the process, without, however, resulting in the commonly reported photolysis-supported breaking down. We present a systematic characterization of the PBAs aiming at interpreting the catalytic outcomes in the light of a classic coordination chemistry analysis, empowered by the most recent findings in literature. We show that varying the transition metal binding the N atom of the cyanide bridge is key to promote photoinduced charge generation and transfer, which effectively disrupts the molecular target. The analysis of the materials before and after the irradiation with solar simulated light results in a change of the lattice parameters, indicating the possibility of a light-induced spin cross-over.

Here, a copper Prussian blue analogue named Cu-HCF was prepared and its polyphenol oxidase (PPO)-like activity was investigated for the first time. Cu-HCF nanozyme showed nearly 7-fold higher substrate affinity than natural PPO and was more stable under alkaline conditions, high temperature, high salt concentrations, and long-time storage. The catalytic activity of Cu-HCF nanozyme was reduced by pyrophosphate (PPi). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) hydrolyzed PPi to orthophosphate (Pi) and hence the PPO-like activity of Cu-HCF nanozyme was restored. A method was therefore developed for selective determination of the ALP activity. The linear range was from 1 to 50 mU/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.35 mU/mL. This approach was validated in human serum samples, showing its potential in diagnostic applications.

In this work, to fully exploit the advantages of highcapacity CoFe Prussian blue analogs (PBA) and structurally stable NiFe PBA, a core-shell heterostructured CoFe@NiFe PBA is successfully synthesized by a two-step co -precipitation method. The construction of the core-shell heterostructure not only suppresses dissolution of the CoFe PBA core, but also facilitates fast charge transfer and efficient ion diffusion during Na+ ions insertion/extraction. With an optimal NiFe PBA shell thickness of 30 nm, the core-shell structured PBA electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling performance with a capacity retention of 72.6 % over 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, when utilized as the cathode material in HCDI, the core-shell heterostructured PBA exhibits intriguing desalination performance, including a high desalination capacity of 49 mg g-1 and excellent desalination stability over 200 cycles (77.7 %). This paper presents a straightforward strategy for designing core-shell heterostructured PBA electrode, with the potential to advance the development of high-performance capacitive desalination.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are considered as promising precursors to derive advanced heteroatom-doped carbonaceous materials. However, the pyrolysis treatment usually results in an inevitable aggregation of active sites as well as the reduction of specific surface area, apart from the un-controllable composition and morphology. Herein, we develop a straightforward synthetic protocol for fabri-cating highly-active OER electrocatalysts of Co7Fe3, Co, N-codoped carbon (Co7Fe3/Co@NC) by annealing trimetallic CoZnFe-PBA precursors. The surface modification of cobalt species over ZnFe-PBA effectively tailors the active composition for as-derived products, whereas Zn volatilization at a high temperature not only pro-motes the dispersion of active sites but also fabricates the formation of an intriguing hierarchical structure with multimodal porosity and high specific surface area. The integrated advantages of multinary composition and fabulous pore structure endow the elegantly-designed Co7Fe3/Co@NC with a remarkable catalytic performance towards OER in alkaline electrolyte, as evidenced by an overpotential of 290 mV without iR-correction at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and impressive long-term durability. The present synthetic strategy offers valuable insights for developing highly-efficient PBAs-derived electrocatalysts with compositional multiplicity and interesting pore texture.

Herein, we investigate the impact of the crystal phase tuning of the representative Zn -Co-based PBA on CO2-epoxide copolymerization. The utilization of oxygen containing tert -butanol molecules (tBuOH) replaces water molecules from the Zn active center within the PBA-based nanosheets, inducing the crystal transformation from conventionally cubic to rhombohedral. The rhombohedral phase can be formed as clusters dispersed within the amorphous matrix, exhibiting the most active and selective CO2-epoxide copolymerization performance with a turnover number of 31,250 g/g Zn compared to that of long-range ordered cubic and rhombohedral counterparts. Such an improvement is ascribed to the abundant exposed Zn-O active centers enabled by the replacement of tBuOH molecules and rhombohedral coordination. Density functional theory calculation indicates different average adsorption energies for cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and CO2 (-5.45 vs.-0.02 eV) on the (001) surface, implying the initialization of copolymerization from the adsorption of CHO onto the Zn-O active centers.

Herein, a rational catalyst design strategy is first reported based on amorphous-crystalline (a-c) interfacial engineering to achieve high catalytic activity and durability under diverse electrolytes that can be used for all types of low-temperature water electrolysis. Abundant a-c interface (ACI) is implemented into a hollow nanocubic (pre)-electrocatalyst which is derived from Ir-doped Ni-Fe-Zn Prussian blue analogues (PBA). The implemented c-a interface is well maintained during prolonged OER in alkaline, alkalized saline, and acidic electrolytes demonstrating its diverse functionality for water electrolysis. Notably, the final catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity with excellent durability for OER compared to that of benchmark IrO2 catalyst, regardless of chemical environment of electrolytes. Hence, this work can be an instructive guidance for developing the ACI engineered electroctalyst which can be diversely used for different types of low-temperature electrolyzers. A high-performance electrocatalyst derived from an Ir-doped Ni-Fe-Zn Prussian blue analog with abundant amorphous-crystalline interfaces is developed for the efficient and durable water oxidations in diverse electrolytes, including alkaline, acidic, and alkalized seawater electrolytes. image					Nayak, Arpan/U-2492-2017; Shin, Tae Ho/M-9322-2016	Shin, Tae Ho/0000-0002-9001-7863													1613-6810	1613-6829				DEC	2023	19	49								10.1002/smll.202303912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202303912		AUG 2023						37612807					WOS:001151994600001

Nevertheless, few studies have been performed to investigate catalytic activities of PBAs for hydrogen generation (HG) from NaBH(4)hydrolysis. No researches have been implemented to examine effects of different M(II)and M(III)of PBAs (M-3(II)[M-III(CN)(6)](2)) (M-II = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn; M-III = Fe, Co) on NaBH(4)hydrolysis for HG. Thus, the aim of the study is to explore and compare catalytic activities of various PBAs for HG from NaBH(4)hydrolysis. While two hexacyano-metalates and different metals are used to obtain various PBAs, Co-3[Co(CN6)](2)(Co-Co) is the most effective PBA for HG from NaBH(4)hydrolysis. Furthermore, Co-Co has a much lowerE(a)of 37.6 kJ/mol for HG from NaBH(4)hydrolysis in comparison toE(a)values by other reported catalysts. Besides, HG by Co-Co could be optimized in the presence of 5% NaOH concentration, which leads to an even lowerE(a)of 28.6 kJ/mol. Co-Co is also reusable and stable for multiple cycles of HG. These features reveal that Co-containing PBAs can be a promising heterogeneous catalyst to facilitate HG from NaBH(4)hydrolysis.

In this work, a novel LiCoMnO4 (LCMO) nanocube was facilely obtained by one-pot synthesis in the presence of Mn,Co-based bimetallic Prussian blue analogue (MnCo-PBA) and LiOH. The well-defined LCMO nanocube with unique hollow three-dimensional (3D) configuration was composed of small spinel structural LCMO nanocrystals with the particle size of 150 nm. In contrast with the LCMO block material, the specific surface area of LCMO nanocube increased, and the corresponding electrochemical activity enhanced significantly. As a Li+-selective cathode in capacitive deionization (CDI) device, LCMO nanocube exhibited high selectivity for Li+ extraction with excellent cycling stability. The Li+ adsorption amount achieved 700 mu mol g(-1), with the separation factor alpha(Li+)(Mg2+) of 88.7 (C-Mg(2+)/C-Li(+) = 30). The LCMO-based pseudo-CDI system was proved to be effective for Li+ extraction from the real salt-lake brine.

Highly mineralized water flows through parallel electrode plates separated by ion-selective membranes. An applied electric field adsorbs ions onto electrodes, creating an electric double layer, and periodic field reversals release enriched ions back into the water while discharging ions on the electrode surfaces, enabling continuous deionization. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using MCDI technology with Prussian blue analog (PBA)/carbon electrodes to treat highly mineralized water in oilfields. The desalination rate under different operating conditions is experimentally analyzed and compared. A comparison is made between the Capacitive De-Ionization (CDI) systems in terms of changes in conductivity, desalination rate, ion adsorption capacity, and ion adsorption rate. Results showed that compared to conventional CDI and HybirdCDI (HCDI), MCDI demonstrates the highest desalination rate, ion adsorption capacity, and ion adsorption rate. It indicates that MCDI has significant advantages in treating highly mineralized water. At a voltage of 1.6 V, a flow rate of 30 mL & sdot;min � 1, and an initial concentration of 1000 mg & sdot;L- 1, the MCDI system exhibited the highest desalination efficiency.

However, the presence of vacancies occupied by crystal water in the structure of PBA prepared by the traditional co-precipitation method leads to rapid capacity decay of the battery, which significantly limits its practical application. In the present work, we use a modified co-precipitation method to synthesize Fe-based PBAs, which has a cubic structure and offers a large Na+ insertion/extraction channel. The results show that 99.9% of the capacity (108.9 mAh g(-1)) retained after 100 cycles of tests for the sample with the most outstanding cycling stability (PB-15). In addition, the samples are heat-treated to remove the crystal water from the acquired PBAs. The freshly prepared PB-15 sample is further treated at 180 degrees C. Phase transformation from the cubic structure to the monoclinic phase of the samples is probed after heat treatment. The initial specific capacity of HT-PB-15 is higher than that of PB-15 by 10.2 mAh g(-1) and the capacity remained at 117.6 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, which is the most outstanding cycling performance in the reported results.

However, the bulk synthesized Prussian blue which is accompanied by aggregation inevitably results in the limited K+ ion mobility and suppressed potassium storage performance. In this work, ultrathin nanosheet-assembled hierarchical Prussian blue materials (K1.4Fe4[Fe(CN)(6)](3)) are synthesized via a facile dissolution-recrystallization strategy. On the strength of this architecture, the positive electrode displays both high rate (71 and 24.9 mAh g(-1) at 50 and 600 mA g(-1)) and long life-span properties (75.2% of the primal capacity retained after 100 cycles) for potassium storage. The enhanced diffusion kinetics and structural stability are further demonstrated through the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique analysis and ex-situ X-ray diffraction. Our work provides a new nanostructuring strategy for improving the potassium storage in intercalation electrodes.

J	Yadav, J; Kharel, R; Konar, S				Yadav, Jyoti; Kharel, Ranjan; Konar, Sanjit			Control of spin switchability and electron transfer in Prussian blue analogues: Insights into secondary interactions and chemical modifications	COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS												The research progress on 3D Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and their successful downsizing using capping ligands to achieve 2D, 1D, and even discrete molecular analogues has greatly enhanced our understanding of the switchable phenomena such as spin crossover (SCO) and electron transfer coupled spin transition (ETCST) in these systems. These molecules exhibit diverse optical and magnetic properties, making them highly attractive for next-generation compact smart devices. However, better control over switchability is necessary to fulfil specific purposes. While substantial work over the past three decades has elucidated the rationale behind ETCST occurrence in some complexes but not in others, parallel investigations into the peculiar ETCST behaviour in response to subtle changes in ligand field, reaction conditions, and guest molecule size have provided improved control over parameters like H-bonding and it center dot center dot center dot it interactions. Efforts to increase the operational temperature range for chemical, thermal, piezo, and photo-responsive switchability of these molecules to practical levels and preserve their pristine properties after integration into devices require further exploration to unlock the optimisation possibilities. This review discusses factors affecting various stimuli-responsive ETCST behaviour in both solid (ligand field strength, lattice solvents, counter-ions and crystal packing) and solution phases (solvent polarity and protonation/deprotonation) with representative examples. We envisage that a better understanding of the factors controlling ETCST properties will enable precise design and targeted synthesis of these molecules.

Herein, a facile strategy is demonstrated to rationally construct CoFe Prussian blue analogues (PBA)@CoP cube-on-sheet hierarchical structure by etching reaction with intermediated CoO to form PBA nanocubes. Benefitting from the heterostructured engineering, the as-synthesized CoFe PBA@CoP presents remarkable electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 m KOH, only requiring overpotentials of 100 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 171 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to reach the 10 mA cm(-2) current density with good stability. Extraordinarily enhanced electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to not only the rapid charge transfer of active species, but also the synergistic effect between each component to achieve tuned electronic structure and abundant electrocatalytic active sites. Especially, the assembled two-electrode cell using CoFe PBA@CoP as both cathode and anode delivers the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low cell voltage of 1.542 V, outperforming most of low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. The controllable and versatile strategy will open up an avenue to prepare hybrid films for advanced electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

Herein, we reported the successful application of interface engineering strategy to introduce low content of Pt species to boost the electrocatalytic activity of FeCo PBAs by ammonia etching and subsequent calcination. The resulting PtCo alloy modified FeCo PBAs (PtCo-FeCo PBAs) complex reveals modest electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials (h) of 139 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 310 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. Remarkably, the PtCo-FeCo PBAs only required small cell voltage of 1.68 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting and the ideal electrocatalytic activity can be maintained for more than 50 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The structural analysis unveils that the strong interaction between FeCo PBAs host and PtCo alloy resulting in charge redistribution and ultimately lead to high electrocatalytic activity and stability of PtCo-FeCo PBAs for both HER and OER.

The development of defect engineering has promoted the application of many technologies, but it is still a great challenge to selectively manufacture defect sites in existing material systems. It is shown here that in situ site-directed tailoring of metal sites in Prussian blue analogs (PBA) can be achieved according to the reducibility differences of different metal atoms, forming naturally nonpreferred unsaturated coordination centers. Meanwhile, the in situ capture of small reducing molecule can realize site-directed tailoring of crystal facets during crystal growth and results in oriented 1D growth. As an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, the resulted PBA with the nonpreferred unsaturated coordination centers shows a low overpotential of 239 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkali, superior to the original PBAs and the previously reported defective PBA derivatives, which can be ascribed to the unsaturated coordination active center and the unique 1D structure. This work opens up opportunities for producing naturally nonpreferred unsaturated coordination center in nanomaterials for broad applications.					xinyu, ding/LFU-8759-2024; Lu, Qingyi/O-4479-2015; Zhang, Chunyan/C-7821-2017	Lu, Qingyi/0000-0002-6160-9499													1613-6810	1613-6829				APR	2023	19	15								10.1002/smll.202207525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202207525		JAN 2023						36627258					WOS:000909882200001

While cobalt sulfides have received increasing attention for activating monopersulfate (MPS), almost no studies have been conducted to investigate cobalt sulfides to degrade CAF. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate cobalt sulfide for activating MPS to degrade CAF. Specifically, a unique cubic cluster of cobalt sulfide nanosheets (CoSNS) is developed through a simple sulfurization of cobaltic Prussian Blue Analogue (CoPBA) (Co3[Co(CN)6]2) under very mild condition (25 degrees C) to convert Co-PBA to CoSNS. CoSNS could exhibit much higher catalytic activities than its precursor Co-PBA, and the benchmark catalyst of MPS activation, Co3O4, for activating MPS to degrade CAF in 45 min. Ea of CAF degradation (24.3 kJ/mol) by CoSNS+MPS is also significantly lower than many reported Ea values, validating that CoSNS is an advantageous and highlyefficient catalyst for MPS activation to degrade CAF. The activation mechanism of CoSNS towards MPS activation is also realized using electron spin resonance. Degradation pathway of CAF degradation by CoSNS+MPS is also investigated by mass spectrometry to provide insights into degradation behaviors. (c) 2021 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

In this study, a Prussian blue analogue (Co3[Co(CN)6]2, PBA) derived CoP coupling with N-doped carbon (NC) as an effective oxygen electrocatalyst PBA-CoP/NC was prepared. Notably, as-prepared PBA-CoP/NC has good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance even comparable to Pt/C (0.855 V), with half wave potential reaching 0.847 V. While, it also has satisfactory performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Importantly, the PBACoP/NC assembled ZAB exhibits an open circuit potential of 1.62 V, and a peak power density of 119.3 mW cm-2, as well as good stability.

In this study, we report a simple strategy utilizing dopamine-coated Prussian blue analogues as precursors to prepare bimetallic iron-cobalt phosphide/nitrogendoped carbon (Fe1-xCoxP/NC) composite materials via a one-step carbothermal phosphorization process. Benefiting from their nanostructured advantages and electronic interactions between Fe and Co sites, Fe0.17Co0.83P/NC, prepared by adjusting and optimizing the ion ratio, exhibits excellent rate capability and cycling performance as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries. It achieves a high specific capacity of 505.6 mAh g- 1 at 0.5 A g-1. Even after 1000 cycles at a high current of 1 A g- 1, the reversible specific capacity remains at 413.6 mAh g-1.

Herein, we propose a dual oxidation strategy of a Co Prussian blue analog (Co PBA), which simultaneously achieves Co3+ active site enrichment, in situ CeO2 decoration and lattice dis-ordering with abundant undercoordinated sites, realizing highly efficient and ultrastable OER perfor-mance. The dual oxidation process can induce the enrichment of high-valence Co ions by combined chemical oxidation and d-f electron coupling compared to the singly oxidized catalysts, thereby provid-ing more active sites with enhanced intrinsic activity for the early triggered OER process. In addition, the disordered lattice can provide abundant reactive Co sites for the pre-oxidation process, thereby leading to obvious activation of the catalysts and remarkable operational stability due to the substantially accumu-lated Co3+ sites. Benefitting from the structural advantages of lattice-disordered dual-oxidized Co PBA nanocages, a low overpotential of 240 mV can be achieved for a 10 mA cm-2 current density, and the large catalytic current density and intrinsic activity are among the best compared to those of previously reported PBA-based and PBA-derived catalysts and even RuO2 and IrO2. In addition, ultrastable OER behavior with a 263 % activity enhancement in 150 h can result, making the dual-oxidized catalyst a promising candidate for water electrolysis.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, the development of efficient photocatalysts for PMS activation remains challenging. Herein, copper-iron prussian blue analogue (CunFe1-PBA, n = 1, 2, 3, 4) nanomaterials were first fabricated through a simple combination of co-precipitation and calcination processes. The as-synthesized CunFe1-PBA composite catalyst was used to activate PMS for the degradation of endocrine disruptor bisphenol S (BPS). As the result, Cu3Fe1-PBA calcined at 300 degrees C (Cu3Fe1-PBA*300 degrees C) mainly composed of CuFe2O4 and CuO showed a higher catalytic activity for activating PMS for BPS degradation than those of CunFe1-PBA composite. Additionally, Cu3Fe1-PBA*300 degrees C/PMS system was suitable for degradation of BPS at 400 mg/L catalyst or PMS and wide pH ranges from 3 to 11 while coexisting inorganic anions (SO42-, NO3-, and HCO3-) and humic acid all inhibited the reaction. Radical trapping experiment, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) proved that Cu and Fe could regulate the charge balance through changes of valence state, and active PMS to produce free radicals effectively, especially the production of O-1(2). Furthermore, the analysis of the BPS intermediates of degradation was carried out by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and two degradation pathways of BPS were proposed.

Prussian blue (PB) analogues with the structure of transition metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are viewed as attractive candidates for high-performance electrocatalysts, while how to achieve the decoration of metal sites without damage for improved reactivity is still challenging. Herein, a nanocomposite catalyst based on PB analogues on cobalt-nitrogen-doped porous hollow carbon microspheres (PB-Co/Co-N-PHCS) was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. Benefiting from multiple active sites, hierarchical porous structure, and high conductive hollow carbon shell, the catalyst showed outstanding electrocatalytic activity and durability for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). More importantly, PB-Co/Co-N-PHCS also can serve as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with high durability. This pioneering work provides a clue for the preparation of a new class of high-performance Prussian blue analogue-based hybrid electrocatalysts.

Na-rich PBAs, NaxM[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot nH(2)O where M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, are prepared via precipitation method under the same condition. The structure, chemical composition, morphology, valence of the transition metals, and electrochemical property of these samples are comparatively researched. The PBA with Mn shows large reversible capacity of 126 mAh g(-1) in 2.0-4.2 Vat a current density of 30 mA g(-1) and the highest working voltage owning to high redox potential of Mn2+/3+ in MnN6 and Fe2+/3+ in FeC6. While, the PBA with Ni exhibits the best cyclability and rate performance though only 66 mAh g(-1) is delivered. The significant differences in electrochemical behaviors of the PBAs originate from the various properties depending on different transition metals.

Herein, for the first time, trimetallic FeCoNi-PBA nanocubes are introduced as precursors, and then a novel core-shell structured composites, in which FeCo and FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles are uniformly encapsulated in N-doped porous carbon (FeCo/FeCoNi@NPC), are successfully synthesized via a pyrolysis process. Benefiting from the strong synergetic effects among multiple components (FeCo, FeCoNi alloys and N-doped carbon species) and the hierarchical porous structure, the absorber exhibits significantly enhanced MA performance in comparison with FeNi@NPC and FeCo@NPC derived from bimetallic PBAs. Impressively, the minimum reflection loss (RL) is up to -67 dB at 14.7 GHz with a thin thickness of 1.91 mm, and the corresponding effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) reaches 6.24 GHz, covering the whole Kuband. When the thickness is 2.05 mm, the maximum EAB of 6.6 GHz can be obtained. In particular, the absorber can also achieve full absorption of X-band at 2.68 mm. More importantly, the multi-metallic PBA derivation strategy sheds new light on development of lightweight carbon-based absorbers with high performance, low cost and easy synthesis.					zhang, zhang/KGK-5266-2024; Yan, Junfeng/GRF-5811-2022	Zhang, Xiaofeng/0000-0003-2738-3286													1359-8368	1879-1069				NOV	2022	246								110268	10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.110268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.110268		SEP 2022											WOS:000862815200003

However, the PBA-based catalyst is prone to structural changes in the electrochemical process under alkaline medium, which may alter the mechanism and kinetics of the electrocatalytic reaction. Herein, a PBA-based catalytic electrode (NiFe/Ni) is obtained by depositing Ni-2[Fe(CN)(6)] on Ni foam through a wet chemistry method. It is found that Ni-2[Fe(CN)(6)] converts to high-valence NiOOH during the electrochemical process in alkaline medium. Meanwhile, the polarons generated by lattice deformation in Ni-2[Fe(CN)(6)] can transform into NiOOH with oxygen vacancies (v-NiOOH). The obtained v-NiOOH endows the catalytic electrode with superior performance for the electro-oxidation of furfural compounds to furoic acids. The in-situ ATR-FTIR and furfural temperature-programmed desorption further prove that the fast furfural electro-oxidation kinetics can be ascribed to the high-flux furfural adsorption ability of the v-NiOOH. In addition, the electrocatalytic oxidation of furfural and photo-assisted hydrogen evolution reaction are integrated into a water-splitting electrolyzer. Compared with the conventional water-splitting electrolyzer, the integrated electrolyzer can reduce the cell voltage by 480 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). This work proves the electrochemical reconstitution of the PBA-based catalysts for biomass oxidation under alkaline electrolyte, which provides a new way for the design of PBA-based electrocatalysts.

The development of efficient electrocatalytic materials for HER has attracted much attention in current research. In this work, a homogeneous NiFe-based Prussian blue analogue (NiFe-PBA) thin film is prepared on the surface of nickel foam by liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) layer-by-layer (LBL) dipping method. Then the NiFe-PBA film reacts with PH3 produced by sodium hypophosphite to form a bimetal phosphide NiFeP film. The electrocatalytic HER properties under alkaline condition indicate that the NiFeP film only requires 99 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and the performance can be maintained for over 30 h without obvious degradation even at 100 mA cm(-2). The results imply that the prepared NiFeP film has excellent HER performance and durable stability. This work is of great significance for the preparation of self-supporting and low-cost bimetal phosphide thin film for efficient HER.

Intercalation of Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> into electrodeposited Prussian Blue Analogue thin films from aqueous electrolytes	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												So-called Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) attract significant research interest for a large variety of electrochemical applications. Recently, they have been recognized as promising electrode materials to implement in aqueous Na-ion batteries for grid-scale energy storage systems. Further types of aqueous batteries using, for instance, alkali metal cations such as Li+ and K+ or multivalent ions like Mg2+, Zn2+ and Al3+ as insertion species for PBA-based electrodes are being explored. In this study we systematically investigate intercalation of Mg2+ into four electrodeposited PBA thin films: Na2Ni[Fe(CN)(6)], Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)], Na2VOx[Fe(CN)(6)], and NaIn[Fe(CN)(6)]. All four electrodes are capable of hosting Mg2+, while NaIn[Fe(CN)(6)] shows better stability upon repeated (dis)charging compared to the other three systems. Surprisingly, even though the hydration energies of Na+ and Mg2+ differ significantly, the mean half-charge potentials of (de)intercalation are comparable for both cations. A correlation between the empirical radii of transition metals present in the structure of PBAs and the mean half-charge potential of (de)intercalation, previously identified for Na+, is also found for Mg2+.

However, their practical application is often hindered by the presence of vacancy defects and issues of oxidation that arise during the material preparation process. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an innovative T-shaped collision microreactor aimed at promoting a uniform concentration field, narrowing the gap between material mixing rate and reaction rate, and providing an oxygen-free environment for the synthesis of Fe-PBA. Employing this microreactor, Fe-PBAs were synthesized with a meticulous approach that led to a material possessing a well-defined morphology and a stoichiometry of Na1.54Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.93). The material exhibited a notable reduction in vacancy defects and minimized oxidation levels. Upon electrochemical evaluation, the Fe-PBA crafted within the microreactor demonstrated an impressive specific capacity of 94.1 mAh/g at a current density of 0.5 C and showcased a long-term cyclability with 72.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles. Comparative analysis revealed that the structural and electrochemical properties of Fe-PBA prepared in the microreactor outperformed those of samples prepared using traditional reactors. This work provides a new approach for the continuous and stable fabrication of high-performance battery cathode materials.

Dominic			Crossover between Tilt Families and Zero Area Thermal Expansion in Hybrid Prussian Blue Analogues	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION												Materials in the family of Prussian blue analogues (C3H5N2)(2)K[M(CN)(6)], where C3H5N2 is the imidazolium ion and M=Fe, Co, undergo two phase transitions with temperature; at low temperatures the imidazolium cations have an ordered configuration (C2/c), while in the intermediate- and high-temperature phases (both previously reported as R (3) over barm) they are dynamically disordered. We show from high-resolution powder neutron diffraction data that the high-temperature phase has zero area thermal expansion in the ab-plane. Supported by Landau theory and single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, we re-evaluate the space group symmetry of the intermediate- temperature phase to R (3) over bar. This reveals that the low-to-intermediate temperature transition is due to competition between two different tilt patterns of the [M(CN)(6)](3-) ions. Controlling the relative stabilities of these tilt patterns offers a potential means to tune the exploitable electric behaviour that arises from motion of the imidazolium guest.

The reaction between GO and Cu2+ or Fe3+ ions in aqueous solution yields GO/Cu2+ or GO/Fe3+, and the nature of the interactions between the GO and the metal cations were demonstrated by FT-IR. GO/Cu2+ and GO/Fe(3+)can be chemically reduced to reduced graphene oxide/metal nanoparticles (rGO/Cu or rGO/Fe) thin films. Both GO/metal cation or rGO/metal nanoparticles thin films were used as working electrodes for electrodeposition of their respective hexacyanometallates (Prussian blue, PB, and its copper analogue, Cu-PBA) based on a heterogeneous reaction between ferricyanide ions in the electrolyte solution and the metallic species in the electrode.

The electrochemical characterization provides excellent electrocatalytic performances during the charge and discharge processes, with oxidation/reduction reactions of high- and low-spin iron, which is already known as the interconversion of Prussian white to Prussian blue (PW reversible arrow PB) and Prussian blue to Prussian green (PB reversible arrow PG), respectively.

Currently, transition metal oxides (TMOs) show huge potential as electrode materials for OER due to their low-cost, rich redox chemistry and high chemical stability. In this work, we report a facile route for uniformly coating CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of nickel cobalt Prussian blue analogue (NiCo-PBA) derived Co3O4/NiO hollow porous nanocubes (Co3O4/ NiO HPN). The accurate control of CeO2 content on the Co3O4/ NiO HPN (Co3O4/NiO@CeO2 HPN) surface can effectively alter the surface electronic states, which tunes the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ for creating abundant oxygen vacancies. The large surface area of hollow nanocubes derived from NiCo-PBA with porous structure offers more active sites, resulting in the great promotion of OER activity. The prepared Co3O4/ NiO@CeO2-2 HPN heterostructure exhibits remarkable OER performance with a low overpotential (290 mV at 10 mA center dot cm-2), small Tafel slope (66 mV dec-1) and excellent durability.

J	Nai, JW; Lou, XW				Nai, Jianwei; Lou, Xiong Wen (David)			Hollow Structures Based on Prussian Blue and Its Analogs for Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion	ADVANCED MATERIALS												Due to their special structural characteristics, hollow structures grant fascinating physicochemical properties and widespread applications, especially in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Recently, the research of Prussian blue (PB) and its analog (PBA) related nanomaterials has emerged and has drawn considerable attention because of their low cost, facile preparation, intrinsic open framework, and tunable composition. Here, the recent progress in the study of PB- and PBA-based hollow structures for electrochemical energy storage and conversion are summarized and discussed. First, some remarkable examples in the synthesis of hollow structures from PB- and PBA-based materials are illustrated in terms of the structural architectures, i.e., closed single-shelled hollow structures, open hollow structures, and complex hollow structures. Thereafter, their applications as potential electrode materials for lithium-/sodium-ion batteries, hybrid supercapacitors, and electrocatalysis are demonstrated. Finally, the current achievements in this field together with the limits and urgent challenges are summarized. Some perspectives on the potential solutions and possible future trends are also provided.

Herein, four kinds of Fe-Co bimetallic Prussian blue analogues (FeCo-PBAs) with different molar ratios of Fe to Co were prepared using a simple coprecipitation method. Interestingly, Fe(III) in K3 [Fe(CN)6] can be reduced to Fe(II) by adding trisodium citrate dehydrate, which could offer a new clue to synthesize PBAs with Fe(II) core ions. With the optimizational FeCo-PBA synthesized at a 0.5/1 M ratio of Fe to Co as an electrocatalyst, the constructed sensor shows excellent comprehensive performance for the 5-HT assay with a high sensitivity of 0.856 mu A mu M-1 and an ultralow detection limit of 8.4 nM. Under the optimum conditions, linearity was obtained in the ranges of 0.1-10.0 mu M and 10.0-200.0 mu M and preferable recoveries ranged from 97.8% to 103.0% with relative standard deviation (RSD) < 4.0%. The integrated properties of FeCo-PBA can be comparable to previously reported electrocatalysts for the 5-HT assay including noble metal-based and expensive carbon (graphene and carbon nanotubes)-based electrocatalysts. The proposed sensor also exhibits outstanding selectivity, reproducibility, and practicality for real sample analyses. This work is the first report on the PBA-based sensor for the 5-HT assay, verifying the practicability of this high-performance sensor for the 5-HT assay.																			0039-9140	1873-3573				MAR 1	2023	254								124138	10.1016/j.talanta.2022.124138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.124138		DEC 2022						36463803					WOS:000932837500003

Structural, electrochemical and catalytic activity of Prussian blue analogues embedded with functionalized carbon for solid state battery applications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												The nanoparticles of Mn-1.5[Cr(CN)(6)]center dot mH(2)O@Ni-1.5[Cr(CN)(6)]center dot nH(2)O core-shell prussian blue analogues (PBA) embedded with carbon additives (PBA-C) were synthesized and characterized as electrode material for solid state battery application. The impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltametry were used to study the electrochemical properties by adding functionalized carbon in 1:1 proportion to improve the electrical performance. The value of room temperature electrical conductivity of core-shell PBA and core-shell nanoparticles mixed with vulcan carbon (PBA-C) are found to be 1.574 x 10(-3) and 1.92 x 10(-3) Scm(-1), respectively. Using Li2La3Zr2O12 (LZZO) electrolyte, single cell was fabricated with PBA-C material, and studied its charging-discharging cycles, which exhibits higher current density with stable performance for 400 cycles for time slots of 400 min. The study reveals that the PBA core-shell nanoparticles mixed with carbon (PBA-C) may be a potential candidate as an electrode material in the form of a single cell using LZZO electrolyte.

To date, numerous excellent studies on PBA-derived electrocatalysts have been reported. In contrast, in the field of photocatalysis, the exploration and reports on PBA and its derivatives are relatively scarce compared to electrocatalysis. However, in the past five years, an increasing number of PBA-derived photocatalysts has been reported in almost every field of photocatalysis. Due to their advantages of tailorable structures, favorable stability, low cost and simple preparation process, these materials show great potential in each field of photocatalysis. In this review, we summarize the latest developments in the synthesis and photocatalytic performance of PBA-derived photocatalysts. Our discussion is focused on PBA-derived photocatalysts in terms of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, photocatalytic water oxidation, and CO2 photoreduction. Subsequently, the design, catalytic performance and catalytic mechanism of PB/PBA-derived photocatalysts are discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects in PB/PBA-derived materials for their application in photocatalysis and guiding principles for fabricating PBAs to realize distinguished activities are presented. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied in the field of photocatalysis. This review is focused on PBA-derived photocatalysts in terms of hydrogen evolution, water oxidation, and CO2 reduction.

However, these cathodes face formidable hurdles by structural failure and poor rate capability, primarily resulting from significant volumetric changes and sluggish kinetics during repeated intercalation/deintercalation of bulky K+ ions. Theoretically, the study reveals explicitly that quaternary medium-entropy PBAs (Q-ME-PBAs), composed of Fe, Ni, Co, and Cu, demonstrate minimal lattice volume variations and low diffusion barriers during K+ ion interactions. This endows Q-ME-PBA with favorable ability to induce significant 3D lattice distortion, enabling the material to endure structural alterations during K+ ion movements and reinforce phase stability. Consequently, leveraging the structural and compositional advantages, the resultant Q-ME-PBAs cathode showcases exceptional cycling performance, maintaining over 90% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.25 C with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 94.4% and retaining 74.7% capacity even after an ultra-long 10 000 cycles at 3.75 C over 147 days. Notably, full cells paired with hard carbon and graphite anodes show outstanding cycling stability and rate capability. This study charts fresh design directions for crafting high-performance and durable cathodes through medium-entropy lattice engineering for advanced PIBs.					wang, xuechun/KVZ-1923-2024; Wu, Xiaoyu/LUZ-7913-2024; Zhang, Qiaobao/HCH-4895-2022; Zhu, Yujie/MXK-1601-2025; Zhang, Shilin/AAT-7135-2021; xu, jijian/D-7306-2013; Zhou, Shenghui/ABG-6182-2020; Zhuang, Zilong/GPK-1958-2022; Peng, DL/G-4096-2010; Guo, Zaiping/O-9848-2018; Xu, Jijian/B-4797-2018; Han, Jiajia/I-3678-2019	Xu, Jijian/0000-0001-7727-0488; Han, Jiajia/0000-0002-2642-0252													1614-6832	1614-6840				2024 DEC 8	2024										10.1002/aenm.202405007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202405007		DEC 2024											WOS:001373977000001

In this study, we have synthesized PBAs using Ni(II), Co(II), and Fe(II) to prepare NiFe-PBA, CoFe-PBA, and FeFe-PBA and have added different quantities of sodium citrate as a stabilizing agent to adjust particle size and surface area. The PBAs also were composited with TiO2, and the efficiency of Cs+ adsorption was compared in the dark and under UV-light irradiation. Larger surface areas and smaller particle sizes yield better Cs+ adsorption with NiFe-PBA, NiFe-TiO2. FeFe-TiO2 exhibits enhanced Cs+ adsorption under UV irradiation. The adsorption capacity of NiFe-PBA more than doubles from similar to 0.8 mmol.g(-1) in the dark to 1.7 mmol.g(-1) under UV light. The adsorption capacity of the NiFe-TiO2 composite approximately triples from 0.45 mmol.g(-1) in the dark to 1.5 mmol.g(-1) under UV irradiation. Enhanced photoinduced adsorption on NiFe PBAs also is observed with radioactive Cs-137(+). The enhancement of Cs+ adsorption by NiFe PBAs is the result of a photoinduced charge transfer reaction within the NiFe PBA structure. This study is the first report of enhanced photoinduced removal of Cs+ using PBAs, which is an attractive strategy for the removal of the radioactive Cs+ from contaminated water.

CuO/Fe3O4 catalyst was practiced as a heterogeneous catalyst, by activating persulfate (PS), for the photo-decomposition of different azo dyes (RhB, MO, CR) under visible light. CuO/Fe3O4 catalyst has validated its excellent photocatalytic removal of all three organic dyes. Synergistic linkage of Fe3O4 with CuO has enhanced the light absorption of CuO/Fe3O4 catalyst resulting in excellent photocatalytic removal of all pollutants under various pH systems amongst which neutral pH was found the efficient one. ESR and radicals capturing studies revealed that SO4 center dot- and HO center dot radicals are dominant ones. The mechanism and the reaction pathway for the decomposition of RhB were also identified. Excellent recycling and stability of as-prepared bimetallic catalyst make it highly favorable, as its application for the removal of organic pollutants to address health remediation and environmental toxicology.

In this work, the unprecedented PBA orthogonal frustums are first prepared from nanocubes through a selective chemical etching approach using trisodium citrate as an etchant. The citrate ions can chelate with nickel species from the edges/corners of NiCo-PBA nanocubes and then disintegrate NiCo-PBAs resulting in the generation of NiCo-PBA orthogonal frustums. The derived CoNi2S4/Co0.91S composites still inherit the original orthogonal frustum structure and possess outstanding supercapacitor performance. This study develops a popularized method to construct novel structured PBAs and brings inspiration for designing PBA-based electrodes with advanced electrochemical performance. The NiCo-PBA orthogonal frustums are first prepared from nanocubes through a selective chemical etching approach using trisodium citrate as an etchant. The Ni-Co sulfides orthogonal frustums are successfully obtained by the gas-phase vulcanization method. image					wan, jiafeng/O-6799-2015; Liu, Yi-Fu/HHC-4631-2022; Wu, Haiwei/ABO-8137-2022	Ma, Fangwei/0000-0001-5533-3177													1613-6810	1613-6829				NOV	2024	20	44								10.1002/smll.202403732	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202403732		JUL 2024						38963164					WOS:001261658900001

Herein, an innovative disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na(2)EDTA)-assisted hydrothermal method is proposed to synthesize monoclinic Fe-substituted Ni-rich PBA (H-PBA) cathodes for Na-ion storage. The as-designed H-PBA cathode combines the merits of the low strain of a Ni-based PBA framework and the enhanced capacity of N-Fe3+/Fe2+ redox sites. It can achieve superior sodium-storage performance in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycle stability. Moreover, ex situ measurements reveal that solid solution (2.0-3.0 V) and phase-transition (3.0-4.0 V) reactions occur during the charge/discharge process to allow almost 1.5 Na+ storage in the H-PBA lattice. Meanwhile, the H-PBA//NaTi2(PO4)(3)@C full cell also delivers remarkable electrochemical properties. Prospectively, this work would promote the practical application of SIBs in grid-scale electric energy storage.

As such, the rational design and facile synthesis of bimetallic-based phosphides with well-controlled architectures and compositions is of scientific and technological importance. In this work, Fe-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocones (NCs) have been successfully fabricated via an intercalation reaction strategy by utilizing layer structured alpha-Co(OH)(2) NCs as self-sacrificing templates. After calcination and phosphorization process, Fe-Co PBA NCs can be converted to Fe-doped CoRP NCs without obvious shrinkage. Electrochemical tests show that Fe incorporation can effectively promote the electrocatalytic activities of CoxP. This simple and effective method will be of benefit for the development of other functional Co-based bimetallic compounds. Furthermore, this strategy can possibly be extended to fabricate a series of PBA materials with special structure and novel morphology, which can serve as a promising platform for diverse applications, especially in energy storage and conversion.					li, qinglin/IWM-3095-2023	Li, Qinglin/0000-0003-2708-6388													2168-0485					JUL	2018	6	7					8150	8158		10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b04457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b04457													WOS:000444924500011

However, their desalination performance is still to be improved for practical application. Herein, we reported the NiCoFe ternary-metal PBAs materials and explored their application as Na+ capturing electrode in rocking-chair capacitive deionization (RCDI) system. On the one hand, the introduction of Ni2+ into CoFe PBA can effectively reduce the lattice changes in the (dis)charging process. On the other hand, the RCDI system with symmetrical structure could avoid the performance deficiency caused by the unbalanced capacity of common HCDI system. Due to the rationalized RCDI cell configuration and ternary-metal PBAs with improved stability, the NiCoFe-PBAs-based RCDI exhibits amazing desalination performance with maximum capacity of 131.4 mg.g(-1) and rate of 0.46 mg.g(-1).s(-1) as well as optimum stability with 90.7 % capacity retention over 300 cycles, surpassing those of PBAs based CDI system reported previously. The special strategy in this work offers inspiration via optimizing the cell structure and electrode materials for the promising development of CDI systems. (C) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

However, the kinetic mismatch between their slow ion storage rate and the demand from short-time desalination severely limits their desalination performance. Here, a group of structure-tuneable Ni-Mn PBAs have been developed by a combination strategy of surface-protected chemical etching and Ostwald ripening to study their ion storage kinetics. Treating them as demos, the characterizations and investigations, e.g., in situ XRD in a three-electrode system, dynamic impedance, finite element simulation, and DFT calculations etc., reveal that the slow ion diffusion caused by the severe agglomeration of the nanoparticles and the unsuitable lattice parameter controls the final desalination behavior. Therefore, the correspondingly optimized sample (HC-t) possessing a microscale hollow structure, nanoscale shell thickness, and expanded lattice, displays a fast ion storage kinetics with the ratio of surface-controlled current as high as 82% at a scan rate of 20 mV s(-1). Consequently, it delivers an impressive desalination capacity of 120.8 mg g(-1) (2.06 mmol g(-1) Na+) with a fast average desalination rate of 0.25 mg g(-1) s(-1) (0.004 mmol g(-1) s(-1)) at 1.2 V, competitive with those reported in the literature. Moreover, the elucidation of the structure-performance correlation provides valuable insights for the development and design of next-generation PBAs for capacitive deionization (CDI).

Herein, we resolve such challenges by constructing the cubic NiCo-PBA bricks assembled 2D nanowalls on Ni foam (NF) through a Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet confined template technique. A great amount of sites are generated along the borders of brick subunits, and the 2D feature supplies downscaled charge diffusion path and high accessible surface area. Therefore, NiCo-PBA/NF exhibits impressive water electrolysis activities, with low overpotentials of 200 and 62 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Moreover, the NiCo-PBA/NF coupled two-electrode system achieves a low cell potential of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, which is even better than the noble metal based IrO2-Pt/C system.

This study investigates bimetallic copper/iron-Prussian blue coordination analogs nanoparticles (CuxFey-PBAs, x = 15, 11, 7, 4, 0; y = 0, 4, 8, 11, 15), which exhibit photothermally enhanced bimetallic central catalytic activity for effective cancer treatment. By adjusting the Cu2+/Fe2+ ratio, CuxFey-PBAs demonstrated remarkable photothermal properties (from 1.9 % to 39.75 %) and exceptional reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity (k: 0.077 min(-1), R-2: 0.97), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent tumour cell death. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations highlighted that the most critical factors influencing photothermal properties are carrier concentration and electron transition. The electronic structure of the bimetallic centre was found to significantly correlate with the reaction pathway and ROS activity. In vitro experiments showed that CuxFey-PBAs can enter cancer cells via endocytosis, induce mitochondrial dysfunction, and cause cancer cell death through apoptosis. Compared to conventional ROS-mediated systems, CuxFey-PBAs with photothermal properties exhibit superior ROS catalytic activity, facilitating photothermally enhanced CDT. These findings represent a significant advancement in synergistic photothermal-enhanced Fenton reaction with bimetallic reaction centres, offering a novel strategy for CDT enhancement.

Prussian blue analogues are a kind of promising pre-cursors for electrode preparation with the features of adjustable compositions and rigid frame structure. In this work, carbon dots/nickel iron phosphide nanoparticles grown on Ni foam have been delicately designed and synthesized from PBAs for the application of cathode of hybrid supercapacitors (HSC). Introduction of CDs is found that not only favors the nanocubes growth of PBAs precursor but also alleviates aggregation of the nanocubes during calcination and phosphorization. The uniform coverage of carbon dots on the phosphides offers hydrophilic interfaces beneficial to the interaction between electrodes and electrolyte and improves the chemical stability of the electrodes. With these assets, the optimum electrode exhibits remarkable areal capacitance (2589 mF cm-2 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2), noteworthy rate perfor-mance and excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the as-fabricated hybrid supercapacitor shows a high energy density and power density, as well as high stability. These results indicate that the CDs/NiFeP-NF electrode has the desirable potential to be a candidate for energy storage devices. The structure modulation in this work may provide a new avenue for development of PBAs-based phosphides materials in the field of energy conversion and storage.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, for the first time, we have proposed an efficient strategy to synthesize Co-Fe bimetallic PBA nanosheet arrays with ultrathin feature and open bimetal centers via one-pot coprecipitation reaction of nickel nitrate and sodium nitroferricyanide in the presence of nickel foam. When employed as the self-supporting bifunctional electrocatalyst, the optimized PBA nanosheet arrays require overpotentials of only 256 and 48 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Remarkably, it allows an alkali-electrolyzer with 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.545 V and a robust operation stability of no less than 36 h. The combination of experimental results and theoretical calculation analysis unravelled that such exceptional electrocatalytic performances could be traced to the ultrathin nanosheet, porous surface structure, and coordinately unsaturated metal centers, enabling abundant active sites, accelerated mass/charge transfer capability, as well as the favorable energy for their transformation to high active Co/Fe-based (oxy)hydroxides during water electrolysis. More broadly, the synthetic strategy is versatile and can be applied to achieve copper foam- and titanium foam-supported bifunctional CoFe-PBA nanosheet electrocatalysts.

This approach leverages the solubility characteristics of K3[Co(CN)6] and the consequential influence of C2H6O on the crystal growth. When the solvent ratios are 1:8, 8:1, and 1:1, the resulting ErCo-PBA precursors nanorods, irregular particles, and spindle-shaped particles, respectively. After annealing, these precursors in an Ar environment allowed the Co/Er2O3/C derivatives to retain the morphology of the precursor well. Electromagnetic parameters testing revealed that Co/ Er2O3/C-1 exhibits superior electromagnetic wave-absorbing (EMWA) performance among the synthesized derivatives with an effective absorption bandwidth of 5.1 GHz at 1.85 mm and a minimum reflection loss of -56.7 dB at 2.9 mm. The incorporation of Er2O3 is an effective method for adjusting and optimizing the electromagnetic parameters of materials, thereby enhancing the EMWA performance of Co/Er2O3/C composite. This study highlights the potential of rare-earth oxide/Co/C composites, synthesized through direct annealing rare-earth metal-organic frameworks, as an absorber and are promising candidate to achieve high-efficiency electromagnetic wave absorption.					yuan, jujun/R-8466-2016; Rong, Chuicai/GLR-6253-2022; Ling, Wei/JZS-8323-2024														2468-0230					DEC	2024	55								105389	10.1016/j.surfin.2024.105389	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfin.2024.105389		NOV 2024											WOS:001354770400001

However, poor cycling stability caused by lattice strain and volume change remains to be improved. Herein, metal-doping strategy has been demonstrated in FeNiHCF, Na1.40Fe0.90Ni0.10[Fe(CN)(6)](0.85)center dot 1.3H(2)O, delivering a capacity as high as 148 mAh g(-1) at 10 mA g(-1). At an exceptionally high rate of 25.6 A g(-1), a reversible capacity of similar to 55 mAh g(-1) still can be obtained with a very small capacity decay rate of 0.02 % per cycle for 1000 cycles, considered one of the best among all metal-doped PBAs. This exhibits the stabilizing effect of Ni doping which enhances structural stability and long-term cyclability. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals an extremely small (similar to 1 %) change in unit cell parameters. The Ni substitution is found to increase the electronic conductivity and redox activity, especially at the low-spin (LS) Fe center due to inductive effect. This larger capacity contribution from LS Fe2+C6/Fe3+C6 redox couple is responsible for stable high-rate capability of FeNiHCF. The insight gained in this work may pave the way for the design of other high-performance electrode materials for sustainable sodium-ion batteries.

In this work, we synthesized the core-shell Fe-Co-Co PBAs@C-g-C3N4 tags with luminophores and co-reaction accelerators via a facile and green method. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that Fe-Co-Co PBAs was used as an efficient co-reaction accelerator of the carboxylated graphene-like carbon nitride /peroxydisulfate (C-g-C3N4 /S2O82-) ECL system for signal amplification. In view of the prominent quenching effect of MTX on the ECL response of the C-g-C3N4, the proposed ECL biosensor exhibited high sensitivity to quantify the concentration of MTX from 5 pM to 10 mu M with a detection limit of 1.1 pM. Simultaneously, the biosensor has also been successfully applied to MTX detection in human serum and urine samples with reasonable recoveries. Hence, the proposed method holds a new perspective of PBAs nanomaterials in biosensing and provides a potential analysis method for the rapid detection of MTX in biological systems.																				0925-4005				OCT 15	2019	297								126767	10.1016/j.snb.2019.126767	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.126767													WOS:000478562700045

However, poor conductivity and shuttle effect have become the major obstacles for their development. In the present investigation, we prepared porous biochar-coated metal nanoparticles CoFe@NC/PPC by loading the Prussian blue analogues onto the biomass pomelo peel (PP), followed by calcination. Both rich nitrogen-doped pore structure and CoFe nanoparticles can reduce the shuttle effect in the cycle, and biochar can enhance the conductivity of the sulfur cathode, promoting the complete reaction of sulfur. It is found that after being sulfur-injected and made into a button cell, it exhibits good electrochemical performance. The initial specific capacity was found to be close to 915.6 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and it remained at 447.4 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 97.3%.

However, most of the PBAs are imperfect with structural defects and crystal water, which cause the electrochemical performance to be far from ideal and unsuitable for industrial application. In this review, firstly, the origin of defects in PBAs has been elucidated comprehensively from the aspect of nucleation and growth. Subsequently, the effective strategies to eliminate these defects are thoroughly summarized and discussed.

Herein, a template polymerization-guided synthetic strategy is presented to confine hollow Prussian blue analog boxes inside conducting polypyrrole nanotubes (H-CoFe PBA@PPy NTs) as efficient peroxymonosulfate activator toward catalytic oxidation of toxic organic contaminants. This delicately designed H-CoFe PBA@PPy NTs display a superior kinetic rate constant compared with the pristine CoFe PBA cubes (7.9 fold) and H-CoFe PBA boxes (22.6 fold). Experimental evidence reveals that the generation of multiple reactive oxygen species in the nanotubes plays a vital role for the significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency for dye degradation. The superior catalytic performance is attributed to the intrinsic bimetallic CoFe PBA to provide abundant active sites, distinct nanotubular structure to concentrate the reactant molecules within a confined space, and excellent electron/mass transport property.

Herein, the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) functionalized graphene oxide (GO) membranes, referred as PGMs, was successfully fabricated. It exhibited a package-like confined structure where Co -Fe PBAs were encapsulated within interconnected GO nanosheets. The surface properties, internal structure as well as the catalytic performance of PGMs were controlled by adjusting the amount of Co -Fe PBAs anchored on GO nanosheets. The designed PGM as efficient peroxymonosulfate activator exhibited exceptional catalytic performance, achieving complete removal of bisphenol A (BPA) with a retention time of 31 ms. The corresponding first-order rate constant was 6000 min(-1) , which surpassed conventional batch system by four orders of magnitude (0.2194 min(-1 )). Moreover, the redox cycle involving Fe 2+ and Co 3+ , coupled with the effective suppression of ion leaching from Co -Fe PBAs nanoparticles ( <10 mu g/L) through GO protective layers, ensured the stable catalytic performance of PGM over 144 h.

In this sensor, introduction of unique thin-layer structure Ti3C2Tx MXene as the interlayer spacers to accommodate ferrocene and CoFe-PBA prevented the restacking of MXene and CoFe-PBA, meanwhile gained higher conductivity. The CoFe-PBA/Fc-Ti3C2Tx was observed by SEM and TEM to possess abundant heteroatom-functionalized multiple-layers structure, and it was therefore endowed with a faster electron transfer rate and a greater electrochemically active surface area. Furthermore, the sensor was investigated using differential pulse voltammetr (DPV) and superiorelectrochemical sensing performance for xanthine detection was achieved with rather wide linear range (3 x 10-8 to 1.007 x 10-3 M), a remarkably low detection limit (0.002 & mu;M), and superior stability.

Aiming at selective capture of Cs+ from wastewater, a core-shell adsorbent, Prussian blue analog@g-alumina (PBA@Al2O3) pellets were synthesized using the hydrothermal-stepwise deposition method. The coreshell PBA@Al2O3 pellets showcased a PBA loading of 25% and demonstrated a maximum adsorption capacity of 15.65 mg center dot g-1. The adsorption data was consistent with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model. It effectively reduced bulk Cs+ concentrations from an initial 6.62 mg center dot L-1 to 2 mg center dot L-1, achieving a removal efficiency of 99.97% and distribution coefficient (Kd) of 1.265 - 106 ml center dot g-1, surpassing the performance of other PBA-based materials. The material also indicated good mechanical properties and cesium ion removal rates of 99.7% across a wide pH range (1.82 to 11.12). Furthermore, PBA@Al2O3 exhibited consistent removal rate of over 99% and good selectivity (SF1/450-1600) towards Cs+ even in the presence of interfering ions such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions. The Kd(Cs+) for PBA@Al2O3 in simulated seawater and groundwater were 9.92 - 103 and 2.23 - 104 ml center dot g-1, where the removal rates reached 96.1% and 98.2%, respectively. XPS confirms that the adsorption mechanism is the ion exchange between Cs+ and K+ ions. This study underscores the significant potential of inorganic core-shell pellets adsorbents as promising agents for the selective capture of Cs+ from wastewater.

Herein, we propose a versatile synthetic protocol of cation exchange to prepare PBA submicroboxes with distinct hollow structures. Cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) submicroboxes are exemplified as advanced electrode materials to demonstrate the efficient synthesis, which exhibit a high specific capacitance of 292 F g(-1) in the neutral Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Na-ion hybrid supercapacitor constructed with the CoHCF submicroboxes as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode can work in a reversible and stable operating voltage as high as 2.0 V in an aqueous electrolyte, thereby rendering outstanding electrochemical properties, a high energy density of 42.5 Wh kg(-1), a high power density of 21.1 kW kg(-1), and long cycling stability with a capacitance loss of 10% after 5000 cycles. More significantly, our method can be extended to rationally synthesize different kinds of PB/PBA hollow structures for a broad range of potential applications.

Here, two Prussian blue analogue encapsulated gold nanoparticles (Au@PBA NPs) with different triple-bond Raman emissions were synthesized to prepared novel red inkjet inks for security labels. And the ink formulation was well optimized to obtain suitable surface tension and viscosity. The labels contain public information in red as well as secret information that can only be acquired using Raman spectroscopy. With the visible public information on the labels, the secret information is not easy to be noticed. Also, the secret information written by the triple-bond Raman scattering is readily identifiable without interference.

Particle dispersion is a key physical parameter of electrode materials, and understanding its impact on electrochemical performance is a prerequisite for obtaining high-performance PBAs. In this article, two PBAs samples with different particle dispersion were synthesized through sodium citrate-assisted co-precipitation method by means of staying and stirring. The influence of particle dispersion on electrochemical performance was investigated through polarization curve and AC impedance tests. It was found that PBAs with well-dispersed particles exhibited excellent rate performance, with a capacity of similar to 120 mAh g(-1) at 1 C rate and a capacity retention of 75 % after 100 cycles. The capacity retention rate could reach 63 % at 5 C rate, far higher than that of PBAs samples with poor particle dispersion. From the perspective of electrochemical kinetics analysis, it has been shown that PBAs with well-dispersed particles exhibit smaller electrochemical polarization and faster Na+ diffusion reaction kinetics, which are key factors in achieving excellent rate performance.																			1439-4235	1439-7641				MAR 1	2024	25	5							e202300960	10.1002/cphc.202300960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202300960		JAN 2024						38179835					WOS:001144660500001

Herein, for the first time, nanomaterials composed of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with tailorable coordination metal ions were synthesized and operated as adsorbents for selective separation of His-rich proteins. Benefiting from the strong metal affinity forces between the His residual in protein and the immobilized Cu2+, Ni2+ and Co2+ in CuFe, NiFe and CoFe PBAs, the obtained adsorbents exhibit highly selective adsorption performance for structure-selective proteins toward bovine hemoglobin (BHb). As a results, the maximum adsorption capacities of CuFe, NiFe and CoFe PBAs for BHb are 3365.8 mg g-1, 2421.3 mg g-1 and 1791.2 mg g-1, respectively. Moreover, the high-performance CuFe, NiFe and CoFe PBAs can be easily regenerated and used to effectively separation of BHb from real bovine blood samples, permitting their excellent practicality in the complex biological sample pretreatment, and further expanding the application scope of the traditional classical coordination compound in biochemical analysis fields.

The nickel hydroxide arrays are synthesized in titanium foil and reacted with K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]. The plate-like morphology of the nickel hydroxide is perfectly preserved and combined with abundant PBA nanocubes. After phosphidation at 350 degrees C, the obtained sample demonstrated excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in both acid and alkaline solutions to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of only 70 and 121 mV, respectively. With an overpotential of 266 mV, it can reach a larger current density of 500 mA cm-2 in acid. The efficient HER activity of the obtained sample is mainly ascribed to its structural advantage with various active metal sites derived from the nickel hydroxide and PBA precursor. In addition, long-term stability measurements have verified the good performance of the obtained sample in acid and alkaline solutions. An increment of overpotential of only 8 and 9 mV is observed, in the acid and alkaline solutions respectively. Beyond these assets, it is supposed that the strategy to synthesize 3D PBA arrays from nickel hydroxide can be extended to other metal-organic frameworks arrays for more electrochemical applications.

The results suggested that this PBA@ZnTi-LDH prepared using LDH as skeleton and transition metal source showed higher adsorption capacity (243.9 mg/g) and water stability than conventional PBAs, and promising application in scale-up Cs+ removal. Thus, it was granulated by calcium alginate and the PBA@ZnTi-LDH/CaALG exhibited favorable post-separation and fixed-bed adsorption ability at different Cs+ concentrations and flow rates, highlighting its application perspective on Cs+ removal from various kinds of wastewater. Moreover, the real-world Cs+ removal was preliminarily explored using natural complex Cs+-containing water. As a result, this stable and easily separated PBA@ZnTi-LDH/CaALG showed high removal efficiency, selectivity and good reusability, which was promising in scale-up Cs+ removal from the real-world wastewater.

The novel hollow porous CoFe PBA with KCoFe phase was synthesized via self-template epitaxial growth strategy. Benefiting from the filling of K ions and the hollow porous structure, the electron transfer rate and the mass transfer rate of CoFe PBA were improved, further enhancing the catalytic capacity. In addition, the special dendritic morphology of PdAg NDs can maximize the proportion of catalytic active sites, and stable Pd-N and AgN bonds can further fix more immune molecules to increase the sensitivity of electrochemical immunosensors. Under optimized parameters, the fabricated immunosensor demonstrated a wide linear range detection from 100.0 fg mL(-1) to 200.0 ng mL(-1), and a low detection limit of 18.6 fg mL(-1). Simultaneously, the immunosensor with acceptable reproducibility, specificity, stability and exhibited satisfactory performance in human serum analysis.

In particular, the exquisite Fe/Co system displays tuneable optical and magnetic behaviours associated with thermally and photo-induced metal-to-metal electron transfer processes. Recently, numerous research groups have been involved in the transfer of these electronic properties to new Fe/Co coordination networks of lower dimensionality as well as soluble molecular analogues in order to facilitate their manipulation and integration into devices. In this review, the most representative examples of tridimensional Fe/Co Prussian blue compounds are described, focusing on the techniques used to understand their photomagnetic properties.

J	Lin, KYA; Chen, BJ				Lin, Kun-Yi Andrew; Chen, Bo-Jau			Prussian blue analogue derived magnetic carbon/cobalt/iron nanocomposite as an efficient and recyclable catalyst for activation of peroxymonosulfate	CHEMOSPHERE												A Prussian blue analogue, cobalt hexacyanoferrate Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), was used for the first time to prepare a magnetic carbon/cobalt/iron (MCCI) nanocomposite via one-step carbonization of Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2). The resulting MCCI consisted of evenly-distributed cobalt and cobalt ferrite in a porous carbonaceous matrix, making it an attractive magnetic heterogeneous catalyst for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). As Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation was adopted as a model test for evaluating activation capability of MCCI, factors influencing RhB degradation were thoroughly examined, including MCCI and PMS dosages, temperature, pH, salt and radical scavengers. A higher MCCI dosage noticeably facilitated the degradation kinetics, whereas insufficient PMS dosage led to ineffective degradation. RhB degradation by MCCI-activated PMS was much more favorable at high temperatures and under neutral conditions. The presence of high concentration of salt slightly interfered with RhB degradation by MCCI-activated PMS. Through examining effects of radical scavengers, RhB degradation by MCCI-activated PMS can be primarily attributed to sulfate radicals instead of a combination of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals. Compared to Co3O4, a typical catalyst for PMS activation, MCCI also exhibited a higher catalytic activity for activating PMS. In addition, MCCI was proven as a durable and recyclable catalyst for activating PMS over multiple cycles without efficiency loss and significant changes of chemical characteristics. These features demonstrate that MCCI, simply prepared from a one-step carbonization of Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2), is a promising heterogeneous catalyst for activating PMS to degrade organic pollutants.

Manganese-based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) (KMnHCF/NaMnHCF) are ideal candidates for low-cost and high theoretical specific capacity merits. But the rapid decline hinders their application, due to side reactions caused by water imbalance. Here, an equilibrium strategy, which can balance the interstitial water supplement and water attack, is proposed. As proof of the concept, xCS (x: proportion, CS: co-solvent, such as polyethylene glycol and trimethyl phosphate) equilibrium electrolytes are introduced to solve the rapid decline. Assisting with the electrolyte, KMnHCF realizes excellent performance (10 000 cycles), which is beyond most cathode materials of sodium-ion batteries. The full batteries composed of KMnHCF cathode and NaTi2(PO4)(3) anode also display outstanding performance (7000 cycles) and promising application prospects at low-temperature and engineering scenes. And then, the equilibrium electrolyte concept is verified by NaMn0.8Fe0.2HCF and NaMnHCF, proving its universality for low-cost and long-life manganese based PBAs.					li, yf/KHX-1148-2024	wang, haoyu/0009-0001-2467-5331													1613-6810	1613-6829				NOV	2023	19	46								10.1002/smll.202303896	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202303896		JUL 2023						37460403					WOS:001026758400001

However, few reports are available on exploring the PBAs-based materials in the field of water oxidation due to their poor conductivity and limited catalysis performance. Herein, a chemical corrosion strategy is proposed to in-situ hierarchically deposit Ni-Fe Prussian-blue analogue (NiFePBA) on Ni foam (NF) to fabricate the 3D self-supported electrode. Followed by acid etching and calcination at low temperature, this semisacrificial template derives a core-shell heterojunction, in which the undecomposed NiFePBA serves as the core and the surficial NiFe2O4 acts as the shell. This well-designed composite delivers a prominent performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 244 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and 304 mV at 100 mA.cm(-2). This hierarchical structure provides abundant active sites, facilitates electrolyte infiltration and promotes fast charge and mass transportation, which all contribute to the remarkable activity towards water oxidation. Additionally, the chemical corrosion strategy in this work opens a promising avenue to deposit PBAs or PBAs derivatives on the metal substrates to fabricate multiple 3D self-supported electrodes.

Herein, by synergistic incorporation of low-cost Cu and Fe into the manganese sites of Mn-PBAs, the ternary PBAs (T-PBAs) achieve solid solution reaction of Na+ extraction and insertion, successfully eliminating the inherent multi-phase transition from the sodium storage mechanism of T-PBAs. Ex situ analysis and density functional theory calculations are employed to confirm that T-PBAs consistently maintain a cubic phase with smaller lattice distortion rather than occur in conventional three-phase transition during the charging and discharging processes, forcefully inhibiting the structural degradation of T-PBAs. Therefore, the T-PBAs showcase unprecedented cycling stability at both room temperature (10 000 cycles at 1 A g-1) and -20 degrees C (over 3000 h, 4200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 without distinct capacity degradation), More importantly, when paired with commercial hard carbon, the T-PBAs based sodium-ion batteries exhibit excellent capacity retention (2000 cycles 76.8%), showcasing their immense potential in practical applications.

Nevertheless, the conventionally prepared PBAs inevitably suffer from inferior crystallinity and lattice defects, leading to low specific capacity, poor rate capability, and unsatisfied long-term stability. As the Na+ migration within PBAs is directly dependent on the periodic lattice arrangement, it is of essential significance to improve the crystallinity of PBAs and hence ensure long-range lattice periodicity. Herein, a chemical inhibition strategy is developed to prepare a highly crystallized Prussian blue (Na2Fe4[Fe(CN)(6)](3)), which displays an outstanding rate performance (78 mAh g(-1) at 100 C) and long life-span properties (62% capacity retention after 2000 cycles) in sodium storage. Experimental results and kinetic analyses demonstrate the efficient electron transfer and smooth ion diffusion within the bulk phase of highly crystallized Prussian blue.

The development of high-performance and durable non-noble metal catalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for advancing the practical use of Mg-air batteries. The synergistic interaction between different metals in bimetallic catalysts is an effective strategy for enhancing the activity and stability of the catalysts. Herein, various prussian blue analogues (PBA) were selected as precursors to synthesis the bimetallic CoNi@NC, monometallic Co@NC and Ni@NC catalysts due to tunable chemical compositions. Compared with Co@NC and Ni@NC, the bimetallic CoNi@NC pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C (CoNi@NC-600) exhibits outstanding ORR performances and stability in alkaline (0.1 M KOH) and neutral (3.5 wt % NaCl) electrolytes. Following 5000 CV cycles, the half-wave potentials for CoNi@NC-600 show only minor negative shifts of 8 and 7 mV, respectively. Meanwhile, the CoNi@NC-600 possesses the similar ORR reaction mechanism and activity with Pt/C. The primary Mg-air battery assembled with CoNi@NC-600 displays better discharge performances than that of Co@NC and Ni@NC. This study lays the foundation for future investigations into the advancement of non-precious bimetallic catalysts for ORR in Mg-air batteries.					xu, junyao/MFZ-6615-2025															2566-6223				FEB	2025	8	2							e202400418	10.1002/batt.202400418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/batt.202400418		DEC 2024											WOS:001374653100001

In this study, a novel adsorbent (PBA-CFs) was successfully fabricated by securely anchoring Prussian blue analog on porous collagen fibers (CFs) crosslinked with Zr4+. PBA-CFs showed low pH sensitivity and high adsorption capacity (qe) for cesium, with an optimal adsorption pH range of 2???10 and a maximum of 1.32 mmol g- 1. The novel adsorbent also displayed high selectivity for Cs+ in the presence of competing ions (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, or Co2+). They could effectively remove above 98 % Cs+ from tap water, lake water, and mineral water and more than 75 % of Cs+ in seawater at the Cs+ concentration of 10???60 mg/L. The adsorption process could rapidly reach equilibrium within 30 min and satisfy the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. Adsorption thermody-namics further indicated the process was exothermic, feasible, and spontaneous. Significantly, PBA-CFs exhibited superior adsorption performance in the continuous column process, with qo of 1.53 mmol g-1. One gram of PBA-CFs could effectively treat 4.03 L (666 BV) of water at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min -1, with a removal rate beyond 95 %, superior to other common adsorbents. Moreover, 0.1 mol/L NH4Cl solution with pH 2 could rapidly regenerate the saturated PBA-CF column. PBA-CFs demonstrated notable irradiation stability after exposure to 10???350 kGy of 60Co ??-ray. These results demonstrate PBA-CFs are a highly effective and promising adsorbent for the removal of radioactive 137Cs from wastewater. This work not only provides a feasible method for Cs+ removal to facilitate the environmental protection and sustainable development of nuclear energy but also extends the effective application and circular development of CFs as a reproducible biomass resource.

The MB@ZrHCF exhibits enhanced peroxidase-mimicking activity and ultrafast catalytic rate via the color reaction of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) oxidized by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The catalytic reaction mechanism of MB@ZrHCF catalyzing H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) was studied. Then, MB@ZrHCF was successfully applied to the detection of H2O2. Additionally, the catalytic activity of the nanocomposite is inhibited due to the steric hindrance effect from the coordination of PO43- and Zr(IV) node. Based on this, the MB@ZrHCF nanozyme can be used to detect PO43- in two linear ranges (10-100 mu M and 100-200 mu M) with a limit of detection of 2.25 mu M. The proposed colorimetric sensor possesses excellent selectivity and reliability for PO43- sensing, which can be successfully applied to detect PO43- in sea and tap water samples.

In this study, the synthesis strategy of highly open 3-dimensional frame structure Prussian blue analogues (CoFe-PBA) was explored through structure self-transformation, which was jointly guided by template mediated epitaxial growth, restricted assembly and directional assembly. Additionally, good application prospect of CoFe-PBA as combustion catalyst was discussed. The results show that unexpected thermal decomposition behavior can be achieved by limiting AP(ammonium perchlorate) to the framework of CoFe-PBA. The high temperature decomposition stage of AP can be advanced to 283.6 degrees C and the weight loss rate can reach 399.0%. In-situ monitoring shows that CoFe-PBA can accelerate the formation of NO and NO2. The calculation of reaction kinetics proved that catalytic process was realized by increasing the nucleation factor. On this basis, the catalytic mechanism of CoFe-PBA on the thermal decomposition of AP was discussed, and the possible interaction process between AP and CoFe-PBA during heating was proposed. At the same time, another interesting functional behavior to prevent AP from caking was discussed.					zheng, zeyu/A-3867-2013; Zhang, Yifu/AFZ-2747-2022	Zhang, Yifu/0000-0003-2546-9502; chi, huang/0000-0002-0265-2438; Zhou, Peng/0000-0003-4285-7275													1613-6810	1613-6829				MAY	2023	19	20								10.1002/smll.202207023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202207023		JAN 2023						36642801					WOS:000915783100001

Herein, uniform Co(OH)(2) nanosheets are grown on activated carbon cloth (CC) by electrodeposition, which are subsequently embedded with Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes by the ion-exchange, obtaining Co(OH)(2)/PBA/CC electrodes. The uniform distribution and tight interfacial contact between Co(OH)(2) and PBA on CC result in low resistance and high specific capacitance (1175.7 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2)). Notably, the asymmetric FSCs (Co(OH)(2)/PBA/CC//activated carbon/CC) exhibit an ultrawide potential window of 2.1 V and thus yield a high energy density of 0.4 mWh cm(-2) at a power density of 1.5 mW cm(-2). In addition, the FSCs exhibit excellent mechanical strength and flexibility with 87.1% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles.

Herein, a two-step strategy is developed to synthesize Fe-V-P/graphene aerogel based on prussian blue analogue (Fe-V-P/GA) electrocatalysts, which possess dense arrangement of anomalous octahedron structure. In the vanadium-modified PBAs (FeV-PBAs), Fe/V with a series of different molar ratios has been investigated and when the molar ratio of Fe/V is 1:1, the catalyst achieves a fairly high specific surface area expressed by the double-layer capacitance of 5.29 mF cm-2 and requires overpotentials of only 234.0 and 314.3 mV to attain the benchmark current density of 10 and 50 mA cm-2 during OER process. Besides, the catalyst owns satisfactory stability and the current density remains almost constant during stability tests lasting up to 70 h. As revealed via electrochemical kinetics analysis and the spectroscopic measurement, embellished FeV-PBAs not only lead to larger tangible area, more accessible sites and higher durable stability, but also provide formation of high valence state of iron and vanadium species, strong modification of electronic state and faster kinetics.

J	Lumley, MA; Nam, DH; Choi, KS				Lumley, Margaret A.; Nam, Do-Hwan; Choi, Kyoung-Shin			Elucidating Structure-Composition-Property Relationships of Ni-Based Prussian Blue Analogues for Electrochemical Seawater Desalination	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES												Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF), a type of Prussian blue analogue (PBA), has recently emerged as one of the most promising Na-storage electrodes for use in electrochemical desalination. Previous studies have revealed that NiHCF can be prepared with both cubic and rhombohedral symmetries depending on the oxidation state of Fe (Fe-II vs Fe-III) and the related A-site occupancy. However, our understanding of the effects of the lattice-type of the as-prepared samples on their electrochemical performances, structural transitions that occur during sodiation/desodiation, cyclability, and rate capabilities is presently lacking. Additionally, the optimum structural and compositional features required to prepare high-performing NiHCF electrodes have not yet been clearly established. In this work, we report the synthesis of two sets of cubic and rhombohedral NiHCF samples with different particle sizes, crystallinities, and compositions. Using these samples, we systematically elucidated the structure-composition-property relationships of NiHCF to develop rational design principles to prepare high-performing PBAs. Our results show that high crystallinity, a low number of Fe(CN)(6) vacancies, and a large unit cell size to allow for consistent structural changes during cycling are critical factors to produce NiHCF with a high capacity, good cycling stability, and good rate capabilities, and these factors are considerably affected by the synthesis conditions. One of the samples prepared in this study with optimum structural features demonstrates the best performance and stability among any PBA electrode tested in neutral saline solutions to date.

One of the research avenues pertaining to hydrogen energy involves the utilization of solar energy to facilitate the decomposition of water via semiconductors, thereby generating hydrogen. In this study, the sulfur-rich Mn-Cd Prussian blue analogue (MnCd-PBA-S) octahedral structure was synthesised for the first time. The obtained GDY two-dimensional nanosheets coupled with MnCd-PBA-S produced surprising pho-tocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. The hydrogen production rate of the GDY/MnCd-PBA-S composite photocatalyst could reach 7.78 mmol g-1 h-1, which is 5.4 and 84.5 times higher than that of pure MnCd-PBA-S and GDY, respectively. Comprehensive characterization and DFT calculations show that GDY two-dimensional nanosheets can promote the outward movement of photogenerated holes and isolate the oxidation sites on the surface, which greatly promote the separation of electrons and holes in space. GDY is like a "protective film" of octahedral structure, and it reduces the photocorrosion of MnCd-PBA-S. The special spatial structure and syn-ergistic effect of the S-scheme heterojunction constructed by the two can significantly reduce the recombination of electron-hole pairs. This work expands the application of organic photocatalysts and shows the great potential of GDY for photocatalytic water separation.

However, PBAs still suffer from the drawbacks of low electronic conductivity and poor structural stability, leading to inadequate rate and cyclic performance. To address these limitations, CoFe PBA nanocubes wrapped with N/S doped carbon network (CoFe PBA@NSC) as anode for PIBs is designed by using thermal-induced in situ conversion strategy. As expected, the structural advantages of nanosized PBA cubes, such as abundant interfaces and large surface area, enable the CoFe PBA@NSC electrode to demonstrate superior rate properties (557 and 131 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 and 10 A g(-1)) and low capacity degradation (0.093% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1)). Furthermore, several ex situ characterizations revealed the K-ion storage mechanism. Fe+ and Co-0 are generated during potassicization, followed by a completely reversible chemical state of iron while some cobalt monomers remained during depotassication. Additionally, the as-built potassium-ion hybrid capacitor based on CoFe PBA@NSC anode exhibits a high energy density of 118 Wh kg(-1).

The exploration of high-performance and cost-effective electrocatalysts for water splitting is a challenging task to obtain renewable and clean energy.

Furthermore, the defect induced by GQD can provide an abundant lattice mismatch in the matrix of NiFe PBA, which further facilitates faster electron transport and kinetic performance. After optimization, the asassembled O-GQD-NiFe PBA exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance towards OER with a low overpotential of 259 mV for reaching a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and impressive long-term stability for 100 h in an alkaline solution.

To overcome this, factors such as type of crystal structure, transition metal-ion coordination, and nature of the d orbitals being filled must be taken into consideration in the design of suitable host materials. Herein, we report the use of a Prussian blue analogue, sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnFe-PB), as cathode in ZIBs. Its ease of synthesis, rigid open framework, and compositional and electrochemical tunability make this low-cost Mn-Fe-based compound highly attractive. The strong interactions among the two redox centers MnIII/MnII, FeIII/FeII, and C N- ligand allow two close voltage plateaus at similar to 1.50 V vs Zn/Zn2+, delivering a capacity of 89.5 mAh g(-1). Ex-situ X-ray absorption and diffraction techniques confirm the high redox reversibility and structural stability of NaMnFe-PB upon divalent guest insertion. The Fe(CN)6 vacancies and coordinated water in the host lattice are believed to facilitate cation diffusion. The insight gained in this work may pave the way for the design of low-cost cathode materials for next -generation large-scale energy storage systems.

This study reports a facile and practical method to fabricate a non-noble metal catalyst by directly growing a Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue on a 3D porous conductive substrate, which is further phosphorized into a bifunctional Fe-doped CoP (Fe-CoP) electrocatalyst. The Fe-CoP/NF (nickel foam) catalyst shows efficient electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, requiring low over-potentials of 190, 295, and 428 mV to achieve 10, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2) current densities in 1.0 m KOH solution. In addition, the Fe-CoP/NF can also function as a highly active electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 78 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in alkaline solution. Thus, the Fe-CoP/NF electrode with meso/macropores can act as both an anode and a cathode to fabricate an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, only requiring a cell voltage of 1.49 V to afford a 10 mA cm(-2) current density with remarkable stability. This performance appears to be among the best reported values and is much better than that of the IrO2-Pt/C-based electrolyzer.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are broadly recognized as promising cathode materials due to their low cost, high theoretical capacity, and cycling stability, although they suffer from low-crystallinity-induced performance deterioration. Herein, a facile "ice-assisted" strategy is presented to prepare highly crystallized PBAs without any additives. By suppressing structure defects, the cathode exhibits a high capacity of 123 mAh g(-1) with initial Coulombic efficiency of 87.2%, a long cycling lifespan of 3000 cycles, and significantly enhanced high/low temperature performance and calendar life. Remarkably, the low structure distortion and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been identified via in situ synchrotron powder diffraction and first-principles calculations, while its thermal stability has been analyzed by in situ heated X-ray powder diffraction. We believe the results could pave the way to the low-cost and large-scale application of PBAs in all-climate sodium-ion batteries.

People have conducted substantial research on sustainable energy conversion and storage systems in order to mitigate the looming energy crisis. As a result, developing energy storage materials is critical. Materials with an open frame structure are known as Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). Anode materials for oxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphides, borides, and carbides have been extensively explored as anode materials in the field of energy conversion and storage in recent years. The advantages and disadvantages of oxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphides, borides, carbides, and other elements, as well as experimental methodologies and electrochemical properties, are discussed in this work. The findings reveal that employing oxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphides, borides, and other electrode materials to overcome the problems of low conductivity, excessive material loss, and low specific volume is ineffective. Therefore, this review intends to address the issues of diverse energy storage materials by combining multiple technologies to manufacture battery materials with low cost, large capacity, and extended service life.

However, the dissolution of transition metal ions in water can compromise the structural integrity of PBAs, leading to significant issues such as low cycle life and capacity decay. To address these challenges, we proposed a dual-effect additive-modified electrolyte method to alleviate such issues, introducing sodium ferrocyanide (Na4Fe(CN)6) into aqueous alkaline electrolytes. It could not only capture Zn2+ dissolved on the surface of Na1.86Zn1.46[Fe(CN)6]0.87 (ZnHCF) electrode material during the cycling process but also conduct redox reactions on the electrode surface to provide additional capacitance. Through experiments and molecular simulation calculations, it showed that Na4Fe(CN)6 can restrict the movement of Zn dissolution into the electrolyte on the electrode surface. Based on this, an asymmetric supercapacitor based on ZnHCF//activated carbon was assembled with a modified electrolyte. The assembled supercapacitor displayed a specific capacitance of 1,329.65 mF cm-2, a power density of 2,900 mW cm-2, and an energy density of 388.28 mW h cm-2. This study provides a new idea for the design and construction of stable and efficient PBA energy storage materials by inhibiting the leaching of transition metals in PBA.

However, spectroscopic access to both interfaces, particularly upon application of an external bias, remains a challenge. Here, in situ surface sensitive vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy is used for the first time to directly access the interfacial structure of a cobalt-containing Prussian blue analog (Co-PBA) in contact with the electrolyte and TiO2/Au surface. Structural and compositional changes of the Prussian blue layer during electrochemical oxidation are studied by monitoring the stretching vibration of the CN group. At open circuit potential, VSFG reveals a non-homogeneous distribution of oxidation states of metal sites: FeIII-CN-CoII and FeII-CN-CoIII coordination motifs are dominantly observed at the Co-PBA|TiO2 interface, while it is only the FeII-CN-CoII unit at the electrolyte interface. Upon increasing the potential applied to the electrode, the partial oxidation of FeII-CN-CoII to FeIII-CN-CoII is observed followed by its transformation to FeII-CN-CoIII via charge transfer and, finally, the formation of FeIII-CN-CoIII species at the interface with TiO2 and the electrolyte.

Herein, for the first time, hierarchical flower-like cobalt phosphosulfide architectures (defined as CoSP) derived from Prussian blue analogue (PBA) was fabricated through the conversion of Co-based PBA in PxSy atmosphere. The as-prepared polar CoSP could effectively trap polysulfides through the formation of strong chemical bonds. In addition, after the combination of CoSP with high conductive rGO, the obtained CoSP/rGO as sulfur host material exhibits ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 900 cycles at a current density of 1 C. The excellent performance could be attributed to the shortened lithium diffusion pathways, fastened electron transport ability during polysulfide conversion, and increased much more anchor active sites to polysulfides, which is expected to be a promising material for Li-S batteries. It is believed that the as-prepared CoSP/rGO architectures will shed light on the development of novel promising materials for Li-S batteries with high cycle stability.

Their commercialization, however, still suffers from inferior stability, considerable [Fe(CN)(6)] defects and interstitial water in the framework, which are related to the rapid crystal growth. Herein, a "water-in-salt" nanoreactor is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs with decreased defects and water, which show both superior specific capacity and rate capability in SIBs. The air-stability, all-climate, and full-cell properties of our PBA have also been evaluated, and it exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and higher volume yield than its counterpart synthesized via the water-based co-precipitation method. Furthermore, their highly reversible sodium-ion storage behavior has been measured and identified via multiple in situ techniques.

Developing highly-efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is critical for increasing the efficiency of water electrolysis.

The CL intensity of luminol-NaOH system was enhanced about 50 times with the addition of CuCo PBA. When uric acid (UA) was added to the new luminol-NaOH-CuCo PBA system, the CL signal could be reduced significantly. Based on these, an enzyme-free CL sensor was constructed for UA detection with a linear response range from 0.30 to 5.00 mu M, and detection limit of 0.16 mu M (S/N = 3). The other common species in human serum didn't affect UA detection. Furthermore, this CL sensor was successfully applied to detect the UA in human serum samples with high sensitivity.

Nevertheless, they suffer from large volume expansion and sluggish K+ transport due to the huge ionic radius of K+, resulting in limited cyclic life and rate performance. Therefore, accelerated transport kinetics may be the key to designing electrodes with excellent potassium storage properties. Herein, we develop a new synthetic method to in-situ construct a high-efficiency PIB cathode, N-doped P3-typed K0.5Mn0.67Fe0.33O1.95N0.05 nanosheets (denoted KMFON), using the low cost Prussian blue analogue Mn2[Fe(CN)6] as a precursor. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations, the as-synthesized KMFON exhibits large interlayer spacing, small K+ migration energy barrier, high electronic conductivity, and fast K+ transport kinetics, which are attributed to the larger-sized N substitution O. It also manifests an initial reversible capacity of 104.2 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g- 1, a rate capability of 41.5 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1, and a high discharge capacity of 52.2 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 100 mA g- 1. Moreover, the KMFON//pitch-derived soft carbon full cell exhibits a satisfactory rate performance of 49.4 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 and a good cycling performance of 46.8 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1, indicating the great potential of KMFON as a cathode material for PIBs.

Herein, the battery-type electrodes of silver-decorated cobaltosic oxide (Ag@Co3O4, denoted as Ag3@CO) and bismuth-iron oxide (Bi2O3@BiFeO3, denoted as BO@BFO) have been proposed by an in situ oxidation strategy of PBAs. It is surprising that the silver nanoparticles of Ag3@CO are uniformly distributed in the cobalt oxide phase, further improving its electrical conductivity and accelerating the electron transfer rate. The irregular rod nanostructure of BO@BFO enhances its reaction kinetics by augmenting the interfacial contact area. Furthermore, the integration of binary metals not only offers numerous redox reaction centers but also heightens synergistic effects of pseudocapacitive dominated multielectron phase conversion, resulting in enhanced capacity and rate capability. The optimized Ag3@CO cathode material exhibits a discharge-specific capacity of up to 1027 C g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, maintaining an impressive rate of 82.77% despite the high current density of 10 A g-1. In addition, the BO@BFO offers a capacity of 615 C g-1 and is utilized as an anode to establish an asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor (ASC). Notably, the assembled Ag3@CO//BO@BFO ASC device within a voltage window of 1.8 V has achieved an energy density of 55 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1640 W kg-1; moreover, the fully charged device can light up a red LED and drive a small electric fan, demonstrating its potential in practical applications. This work underscores the immense potential of PBA derivative materials of Ag@Co3O4 and Bi2O3@BiFeO3 for driving high-performance ASC technology forward.

However, there are fewer works related to their post use storage. Considering the oxidative stabilization of the material after the selective uptake of Cs, the thermogravimetric properties in powder and bead form, with various Cs and other alkali metal ions adsorbed, and various heating rates were studied. TG-DTA taken in dry air condition shows an exothermic decomposition at similar to 270 degrees C. This temperature varied with the heating rate, mass, and the proportion of adsorbed ions. The best condition for complete oxidation of Prussian blue (PB) is found to be a gradual oxidative decomposition by heating in the temperature range of 200-220 degrees C until the total mass is decreased by >35%. After this, the temperature could be safely increased to >300 degrees C for the complete oxidative decomposition of PB that formed iron oxide and salt of the adsorbed Cs. A pilot scale test conducted using the radioactive Cs adsorbed Prussian blue microbeads (PB-b) confirmed that no Cs was released in the effluent air during the process.

Structural complexity in Prussian blue analogues	MATERIALS HORIZONS												We survey the most important kinds of structural complexity in Prussian blue analogues, their implications for materials function, and how they might be controlled through judicious choice of composition. We focus on six particular aspects: octahedral tilts, A-site 'slides', Jahn-Teller distortions, A-site species and occupancy, hexacyanometallate vacancies, and framework hydration. The promising K-ion cathode material KxMn[Fe(CN)(6)](y) serves as a recurrent example that illustrates many of these different types of complexity. Our article concludes with a discussion of how the interplay of various distortion mechanisms might be exploited to optimise the performance of this and other related systems, so as to aid in the design of next-generation PBA materials.

J	An, H; Na, S; Park, K				An, Hyunjin; Na, Sungmin; Park, Kwangjin			Maximizing the Structural Stability of the Na-Rich Prussian Blue Analogue Electrode through Charge Cutoff Voltage Regulation	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES												Prussian blue and its analogues (PB/PBAs) are promising sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to their easy synthesis and excellent discharge capacity. However, their low structural stability poses a challenge. One critical factor affecting stability is the charge cutoff voltage. Increasing this voltage can enhance lithium-ion battery capacity but may reduce cycle retention due to intensified electrode-electrolyte interface reactions. This study investigates whether this phenomenon also applies to sodium-ion batteries and proposes an optimal voltage to improve both the capacity and stability. By cycling between 3.8 and 4.2 V, the charge/discharge profiles and redox reaction intensity were analyzed. The correlation between structural stability and charge cutoff voltage was re-evaluated based on these findings. An optimal charge cutoff voltage of 4.1 V was identified, creating an additional plateau during initial charging and altering Na+ ion positioning to enhance capacity. Enhanced mobility of ions and electrons was observed through a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed reversible phase transitions and excellent structural stability. This study underscores the strategic use of charge cutoff voltage to enhance both discharge capacity and structural stability, offering insights for advancing PB/PBA cathode materials with improved stability and capacity.

In this work, bimetallic NiFe-PBA derived multi-interface N-doped carbon (NC) encapsulated NiFe alloys/Ni phosphide composites (NFPC) were prepared by thermal treatment and phosphating process. The PBAs samples with different chemical compositions and particle sizes were synthesized by manipulating the proportions of raw materials. The particle sizes of PBAs significantly impact the morphology, phosphating degree and electromagnetic properties of the NFPC composites. The results indicated that the NFPC composites exhibit excellent microwave absorption performance, with a minimum reflection loss of-41.4 dB at 1.36 mm and the effective absorption bandwidth of 4.4 GHz at 1.34 mm. The corresponding microwave attenuation mechanisms of NFPC composites were further investigated.

In this study, a ZnCr layered double hydroxide and a CoFe Prussian blue analogue are combined to afford an earth-abundant photocatalytic assembly involving a visible light-absorbing semiconductor (SC) and a water oxidation catalyst (WOC). Compared to bare ZnCr-LDH, the SC-WOC hybrid assembly exhibits a threefold enhancement in photocatalytic activity, which is maintained for 6 h under photocatalytic conditions at pH 7.

However, the serious aggregation, low conductivity, and easy structural collapse of PBAs nanoparticles limit the practical application in CDI. Herein, the ternary composite Ni,Co-PBA@MXene/PPy is flexibly constructed by integrating the collective advantages of Ni,Co-PBA, MXene, and PPy. In this configuration, MXene not only provides high conductivity but also acts as the good substrate for the in-situ homogeneous growth of Ni,Co-PBA nanoparticles. Furthermore, Ni,Co-PBA nanoparticles could effectively inhibit the self-stacking of MXene and facilitate fast ion intercalation. And the doping of Co in Ni,Co-PBA promotes the redox process by the pseudo -capacitive contribution. Meanwhile, PPy contributes to accelerating ions transport rate and promoting the structural stability of MXene and Ni,Co-PBA. Consequently, the hybrid CDI cell AC//Ni,Co-PBA@MXene/PPy delivers prominent desalination performance with the high salt adsorption capacity (38.7 mg g-1), rapid salt adsorption rate (10 mg g-1 min-1), low energy consumption (0.283 kWh kg- 1-NaCl), and outstanding cyclic stability. Most importantly, the Ni,Co-PBA@MXene/PPy electrode can reserve favorable structural integrity by the significant shielding effect of PPy to prevent Ni,Co-PBA from collapse and MXene from being oxidized.					张, 文/JVP-1610-2024; Wang, Yue/ABA-7451-2021	Zhang, Wen/0000-0001-6118-3136													0169-4332	1873-5584				JUN 15	2023	622								156926	10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.156926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.156926		MAR 2023											WOS:000950615200001

Here we reported a green method for the facile construction of mesopomus Prussian blue analogs (PB) through an ionic liquid-assisted strategy and used for cesium recovery from salt lake brines and geothermal water. The unique nanostructures endowed this mesopomus PB with the improved cesium adsorption capacity (548.7 mg/g), which was 1.5-times as that of conventional PB (362.8 mg/g), placing it at the top level of cesium adsorbents. The adsorption experiments in salt lake brines and geothermal water were conducted and the adsorption efficiency of Cs+ exceeded 90%, while those for other co-existing cations were <4.2%, demonstrating its favorable selectivity in cesium recovery from multicomponent aqueous solutions. The benign adsorption performance and adsorption-desorption stability make it a potential candidate for the sustainable recovery of cesium from different kinds of Cs-containing water resources.

Electrolyte Effects on the Stabilization of Prussian Blue Analogue Electrodes in Aqueous Sodium-Ion Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES												Aqueous sodium-ion batteries based on Prussian Blue Analogues (PBA) are considered as promising and scalable candidates for stationary energy storage systems, where longevity and cycling stability are assigned utmost importance to maintain economic viability. Although degradation due to active material dissolution is a common issue of battery electrodes, it is hardly observable directly due to a lack of in operando techniques, making it challenging to optimize the performance of electrodes. By operating Na2Ni[Fe(CN)(6)] and Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)] model electrodes in a flow-cell setup connected to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, in this work, the dynamics of constituent transition-metal dissolution during the charge-discharge cycles was monitored in real time. At neutral pHs, the extraction of nickel and cobalt was found to drive the degradation process during charge-discharge cycles. It was also found that the nature of anions present in the electrolytes has a significant impact on the degradation rate, determining the order ClO4- > NO3- > Cl- > SO42- with decreasing stability from the perchlorate to sulfate electrolytes. It is proposed that the dissolution process is initiated by detrimental specific adsorption of anions during the electrode oxidation, therefore scaling with their respective chemisorption affinity. This study involves an entire comparison of the effectiveness of common stabilization strategies for PBAs under very fast (dis)charging conditions at 300C, emphasizing the superiority of highly concentrated NaClO4 with almost no capacity loss after 10 000 cycles for Na2Ni[Fe(CN)(6)].

The emergence of nonmetallic materials as SERS substrates, offering chemical signal enhancements, presents an exciting direction for achieving reproducible and biocompatible SERS, a challenge with traditional metallic substrates. Despite the potential, the realm of nonmetallic SERS substrates, particularly nanoparticles, remains largely untapped. Here, we present defect-engineered coordination compounds (DECCs) based on Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as a class of nonmetallic nanoparticle-based SERS substrates. We demonstrate the utility and flexibility of the DECC template by incorporating various metal (M) elements into PBAs to synthesize nanoparticles that deliver substantial chemical mechanism (CM)-based enhancements to the Raman signal with a similar to 108-fold increase.

K0.90Co[Fe(CN)6]0.970.03 & sdot;0sdot.44H2O (: vacancy defect) cubes with uniform size of 20 nm are grown within every honeycomb carbon pore with a diameter of -180 nm. The mass content of Co-Fe PBA reaches 78.61 wt%. The small size, low defects and less interstitial/coordinated water improve kinetics properties and robustness of Co-Fe PBA. Honeycomb carbon further enhances the electronic conductivity and structural stability of Co-Fe PBA. Accordingly, Co-Fe PBA@honeycomb carbon exhibits high reversible capacities of 915 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g after 200 cycles, 658 mAh/g at 1 A/g after 1000 cycles, 496 mAh/g at 2 A/g after 450 cycles.

Herein, a porous bimetallic selenide (NiFeSe) nanocube deposited on carbon fiber paper (NiFeSe/CFP) was synthesized through a facile selenization reaction based on Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as precursors. The NiFeSe/CFP exhibited excellent HER activity with an overpotential of just 186 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH at ambient temperature, similar to most of the state-of-the-art transition metal chalcogenides. The corresponding Tafel slope was calculated to be 52 mV dec(-1), indicating fast discharge of the proton during the HER. Furthermore, the catalyst could endure long-term catalytic tests and showed remarkable durability. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of NiFeSe/CFP is attributed to the unique 3D porous configuration inherited from the PBA templates, enhanced charge transfer occurring at the heterogeneous interface due to the synergistic effect between the bimetallic phases, and the high conductivity improved by the formation of amorphous carbon shells during the selenization. These findings prove that the combination of inexpensive metal-organic framework precursors and hybrid metallic compounds is a feasible way to realize the performance enhancement of non-noble-metal-based chalcogenides towards alkaline HER.

Herein, vanadium hexacyanoferrate (V/Fe PBA) is proposed as a breakthrough to this limitation, and its electrochemical performance as a cathode for aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs) is investigated for the first time. V/Fe PBAs are synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method with optimization of the acidity and molar ratios of precursor solutions. The V/Fe PBAs provide an improved capacity of 91 mA h(-1) under a current density of 110 mA g(-1) (C-rate of approximate to 1.2 C), taking advantage of the multiple-electron redox reactions of V and Fe ions. Under an extremely fast charge/discharge rate of 3520 mA g(-1), the V/Fe PBA exhibits a sufficiently high discharge capacity of 54 mA h g(-1) due to its opened structure and 3D hydrogen bonding networks. V/Fe PBA-based ARBs are the most promising candidates for large-scale stationary energy storage systems due to their high electrochemical performance, reasonable cost, and high efficiency.

Yet, the performance of Na-ion electrode materials needs improvement to be able to compete with lithium-ion electrode materials. Here, sodium-vanadium hexacyanoferrate (NaVHCF) is investigated as a cathode active material in rechargeable Na-ion batteries. We explore the electrochemical performance of NaVHCF in a liquid organic electrolyte and demonstrate a high and very stable working potential of around 3.3 V vs Na+/Na, achieving excellent capacity retention of 73% after 200 cycles.

This is due to PBAs' unique properties, including high theoretical specific capacity, environmental friendly, and low cost. We thoroughly discussed the formation of PBAs in conjunction with other materials. The performance of composite materials improves the electrochemical performance of its energy storage materials.

However, poor electronic conduc-tivity and structural collapse severely limit its application in the electrochemical field. In this work, Na1.13Fe[Fe (CN)]6.3.22H2O electrode materials with stepwise hollow inverted pyramid morphology are prepared by simple hydrothermal method. The inverted pyramid Na1.13Fe[Fe(CN)]6.3.22H2O maintains the stability of the crystal structure and slows down the volume expansion during the Li + insertion-extraction process. Benefiting from the unique structure and composition, the discharge specific capacities of the optimal Na1.13Fe[Fe(CN)]6.3.22H2O electrode (FeHCF-2) are 153.7, 126.28, 119.4 and 113.4, 107.61, 102.52 and 92.46 mAh.g � 1 at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 C, respectively. The first discharge capacity of FeHCF-2 electrode at 1 C is 111.88 mAh.g � 1, and the discharge capacity of FeHCF-2 electrode is 115.04 mAh.g � 1 after 1000 cycles, indicating that FeHCF-2 electrode has ultrastable cycle stability. Therefore, designing the hollow inverted pyramid morphology can be regarded as an available way to enhance the electrochemical activity of Na1.13Fe[Fe(CN)]6.3.22H2O for advanced lithium-ion batteries, and effective design strategies can be used for the modification of other cathode materials for Li-ion batteries.

Immobilizing PB particles onto graphene is a useful technique which facilitates recovery and also enhances catalytic activities. As doping graphene with sulfur/nitrogen (S/N) increases its electro-conductivity and active sites, the composite of PB and S/N-doped graphene should enhance PMS activation. Thus, this study aims to fabricate such a composite. Unlike conventional S/N-doped graphene prepared via post-modifications, trithiocyanuric acid is used as a precursor, which is converted to S-doped graphitic carbon nitride (SCN). The composite of PB and SCN (PBSCN) is then fabricated by growing a cobalt-based PB analogue on SCN. The resulting PBSCN preserves the crystalline structures, textural properties and catalytic sites of PB and SCN. As degradation of Acid Red 27 (AR) is used as a model reaction, PBSCN exhibits a higher catalytic activity than PB and SCN individually, as well as Co3O4 to activate PMS for AR degradation possibly because SCN may facilitate electron transfer and enhance catalytic activities of PB. PBSCN also remains effective and re-usable over several cycles for AR degradation. These features indicate that PBSCN is a promising catalyst for activating PMS and the fabrication technique demonstrated here can be employed to prepare composites of various PB analogues and carbon nitride to exhibit enhanced catalytic activities.

The successful coating of poly(m-phenylenediamine) (PmPD) on the surface of FeyCo3-y [Co(CN)(6)](2) (Fe-Co-Co PBA) was confirmed by SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, FT-IR and XPS. The catalytic performance of Fe-Co-Co PBA@PmPDs was evaluated by activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB), the effects of different influence factors on the RhB degradation efficiency were investigated, including PMS concentration, temperature, initial solution pH, and co-existing inorganic salts. Cobalt ions leaching and stability of the catalysts were studied, Co ions concentration dissolved into the solution from the solid catalysts at 60 min is reduced by half after the Fe-Co-Co PBA is coated with PmPDs. The RhB removal efficiency is higher than 90% even after four cycles and the nanoparticles still maintain the core-shell structure, indicating that Fe-Co-Co PBA@PmPDs is stabile and reusable. Radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra indicate that both SO4 center dot- and (OH)-O-center dot are generated during the PMS activation process and SO4 center dot- is the dominant reactive species. In virtue of its superior catalytic activity, excellent reusability and stability, low metallic ion leaching, Fe-Co-Co PBA@PmPDs could be a promising catalyst for the remediation of contaminated water.

Here, we demonstrated the low-temperature fully fluorinated zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF) coupled with a three-dimensional open framework Prussian blue analog (PBA) with combined advantages for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting reaction. The spectroscopic analysis and the electrochemical studies revealed the combined advantages of efficient electronic effect and active site synergism. Because of good conductivity improvement by Ndoped carbon derived from ZIF and the high electrochemical surface area and active site exposure from PBA derivatives, good catalytic performance was obtained on the optimal catalyst of CoNi ZIF/CoFe-PBAF-30 0, which required a low overpotential of 250 mV to reach 10 mA/cm2 loaded on the glassy carbon electrode, with Tafel slope of 47.4 mV/dec, and very high dynamic and steady stability. In addition, the multi-component with the mixed structure from highly polar metal fluorides promoted the easy formation of the active phase as revealed by the post-sample analysis. The current results showed a novel composite catalyst materials development from the hybrid MOF derivatives, which would be promising in the electrolysis of water oxidation reactions and energy-relevant catalysis reactions.

Antonia			Prussian Blue: A Nanozyme with Versatile Catalytic Properties	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												Nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme-like activities, are becoming powerful competitors and potential substitutes for natural enzymes because of their excellent performance. Nanozymes offer better structural stability over their respective natural enzymes. In consequence, nanozymes exhibit promising applications in different fields such as the biomedical sector (in vivo diagnostics/and therapeutics) and the environmental sector (detection and remediation of inorganic and organic pollutants). Prussian blue nanoparticles and their analogues are metal-organic frameworks (MOF) composed of alternating ferric and ferrous irons coordinated with cyanides. Such nanoparticles benefit from excellent biocompatibility and biosafety. Besides other important properties, such as a highly porous structure, Prussian blue nanoparticles show catalytic activities due to the iron atom that acts as metal sites for the catalysis. The different states of oxidation are responsible for the multicatalytic activities of such nanoparticles, namely peroxidase-like, catalase-like, and superoxide dismutase-like activities. Depending on the catalytic performance, these nanoparticles can generate or scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS).					BUSQUETS, M. ANTONIA/H-6555-2015	BUSQUETS, M.

However, the direct thermolysis of CPs is prone to generate agglomerates, greatly reducing the electrical conductivity and active sites of their derived catalysts. The construction of well-ordered CP nanostructures is a promising strategy for alleviating the above issue, but it remains challenging. Here, a facile chemical etching approach is developed for the fabrication of well-aligned three-dimensional (3D) bimetallic Prussian blue-analogue nanosheet arrays. Impressively, the derived porous metal oxide (Fe-NiO) acts as a remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, which merely requires overpotentials as low as 218 and 270 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution, respectively. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of Fe-NiO is ascribed to the 3D porous nanosheet array architecture, which endows the bimetallic catalyst with abundant electrocatalytic active sites, enhanced surface permeability, and high electronic conductivity. It is expected that the proposed strategy can pave a new way for fabricating highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.

However, abundant coordinated water usually exists in traditional PBAs synthesized in aqueous systems. Consequently, the competition between coordinated water and alkali ions easily causes the rapid structural collapse of PBAs during the repeated discharge/charge cycles, lowering the cycling stability, and rate performance of batteries. Besides, most reported PBAs adopt the cubic/particle-like morphologies with large sizes, which usually suffer from insufficient ion diffusion especially at high rates. Herein, a facile and general strategy for the synthesis of 2D CoCo, CuFe, CuCeFe, and CuCeCo-based PBA nanosheets is reported. As a proof-of-concept application, Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanosheets are evaluated as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Thanks to the lower coordinated water content, smaller impedance and higher lithium-ion diffusion coefficient, Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanosheets deliver a superior reversible capacity of 810.4 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), better rate performance, and higher cycling stability compared to common Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) cubes. Further studies indicate that the capacitance-controlled electrochemical behaviors dominate in the Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanosheets, giving rise to their excellent structural stability and superior lithium storage performance even at high rates.

However, these fields are subject to the high overpotential of ORR (oxygen reduction reaction), OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction), and these reactions are limited by the efficiency of electrocatalysts. Therefore, developing highly active electrocatalysts becomes a key step to solve the above problems. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are ancient synthetic cyanide coordination polymer materials, which are widely used in ORR, OER and HER. The unique three-dimensional open metal frame structure and large specific surface area of PBAs greatly increase the contact area between catalyst and electrolyte, and improve the number of active sites. The easy adjustment of components is beneficial to enhance the inherent activity of each active site in the catalyst. In this paper, the recent progress of PBAs derived materials in electrocatalysis is reviewed. Firstly, different preparation methods of PBAs were summarized, and then the regulatory strategies to improve the electrocatalytic activity of ORR, OER and HER when PBAs derived materials were used as electrocatalysts were discussed in detail, including the chemical composition regulation of doping, as well as the structure and morphology regulation of core-shell structure, open nanoccages structure and composite with other materials. Finally, the major challenges and possible future research orientations in this field were discussed, providing a new vision for further application of PBAs derived materials in electrocatalysis.

Therefore, Ni-PBA, Mn-PBA, and MnNi-PBA were synthesized using a simple ageing procedure followed by a Hydrothermal method to prepare modified MoS2 composites. The crystalline structure, shape, surface area, and elemental oxidation state were analyzed using various studies. Also, the nanosheets formation around cubic structure further shows large numbers of active sites resulting in the high catalytic behaviour of the composites. Among the various composites, the Modified MoS2 based on MnNi-PBA, which was coated using a simple spin-coating procedure, exhibited the smallest Delta EPP separation and the highest JRED value due to the rapid redox reaction at the CE/electrolyte interface and catalytic current. The maximum efficiency of 8.25 % was achieved for MnNi-PBA based composites, surpassing pristine MoS2 (6.72 %) and Pt (7.58 %) under front illumination (100 mW/cm2). Under rear illumination, the cell demonstrated a higher efficiency of 4.96 %, attributed to the high transmittance of the material-coated CE, making it suitable for bifacial applications.

The active materials of 100 nm KNiFe(CN)6 nanocubes form unique morphology by deposition on leaf-like Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. Td-PB/NF shows high mass and area specific capacity, excellent rate performance and long cycle life, when used as the anode material for lithium-ion batteries. More specifically, at the current density of 0.1 mA cm-2, the stable specific capacity can reach 2.1 mA h cm-2, which is comparable to that of the commercial graphite anode. Even at a current density of 2000 mA g-1, the capacity can still reach 375 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles.

Study of oxidation states of the transition metals in a series of Prussian blue analogs using x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF ELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY AND RELATED PHENOMENA												There have been renewed interests in metal-organic framework classes of materials such as Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) due to their potential usage in energy storage applications. In particular, due to their high surface areas, controllable structures and excellent electrochemical properties, PBAs such as hexacyanometalates M-3(II)[A(III)(CN)(6)]2(*).nH(2)O (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn; A = Co, Fe, Cr; n= no. of water molecules present), M-2(II)[Fe-II(CN)(6)]2(*).nH(2)O (M=Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and mixed hexacyanometalates(III) (Fe1-XCox)(3)[B-III(CN)(6)](2.)nH(2)O (x=0.25, 0.5, 0.75; B= Co, Fe) could have possible usage as a new class of cathode and even anode materials for rechargeable batteries. Detailed knowledge of the oxidation states of the transition metals in PBAs is required to improve efficiency and durability of such devices. Furthermore, a link between the thermal expansion observed in these materials and the oxidation state of the transition metal is of interest to synthesize materials with a desired thermal expansion behavior, Here we demonstrate the use of Synchrotron based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra to identify transition metal oxidation states. Our analysis reveals the presence of divalent, trivalent and/or mixed valence transition metals in the materials as well as high-spin and low-spin complexes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the irreversible structural collapse and sluggish ionic diffusion kinetics result in inferior rate capability and undesirable lifespan. Herein, guided by theoretical calculations, a series of ultrafine Mn-PBA@ conductive polymers core-shell composites through an in situ polymerization and encapsulation strategy are synthesized to solve the above existing issues for Mn-PBA. Among various designed conductive polymers (including the poly-pyrrole (ppy), polyaniline, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) coated on Mn-PBA, the Mn-PBA@ppy shows the strongest adsorption for ammonium ions and the highest manganese atom removal energy barrier. Acting as the cathode of AIBs, the designed Mn-PBA@ppy exhibits a remarkable high capacity of 72 mAh g(-1), a super-stable discharge platform of 0.81 V, and excellent cycling stability of 94% retention for over 300 cycles (0.1 A g(-1)) with an ultrahigh NH4+ diffusion coefficient of approximate to 1.38 x 10(-8) cm(-2) s(-1). This work offers an in situ polymer encapsulation approach to simultaneously enhance the ammonium ion diffusion kinetics and structural stability. More importantly, this organic/inorganic interfacial design can promote the development of cathode materials with rapid diffusion kinetics and excellent cyclic stability.					linfeng, Hu/ABD-2222-2021; Zhang, Dongzhi/U-3925-2019; Chen, Min/C-5319-2014; linfeng, Hu/C-6491-2014	linfeng, Hu/0000-0002-0640-508X													1614-6832	1614-6840				2024 AUG 21	2024										10.1002/aenm.202402863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202402863		AUG 2024											WOS:001295285100001

From the perspective of the nucleation and growth mechanism of the Li dendrite, we rationally develop a novel Prussian blue analogues (PBA)-derived separator, where tuning the metal ions bestows the PBAs with open metal site to confine anion movement and thereby afford a high Li+ transference number (0.78), and PBA with ordered micropores could act as an ionic sieve to selectively extract Li+ and thereby homogenize Li+ flux. This demonstrates a highly reversible Li plating/stripping cycling for 3000 h at a practically high current density (5.0 mA cm(-2)). Consequently, a high loading Li parallel to LiFeO4 battery (similar to 10.0 mg cm(-2)) demonstrates ultralong cycling life at high current densities (similar to 5.1 mA cm(-2)). This work highlights the prospect of optimizing PBAs in regulating ion transport behavior to enable high-power Li metal batteries.

The physical parameters of PBAs have a significant impact on their electrochemical performance, among which sodium content is considered one of the key factors affecting electrochemical performance. In this study, PBAs with different sodium contents are prepared using sodium citrate-assisted co-precipitation method, and the influence of sodium content on the electrochemical performance is systematically investigated. Furthermore, the morphological and structural changes of cubic and monoclinic PBAs samples after cycling are studied to explore the intrinsic mechanism of how sodium content affects the electrochemical performance. The study reveals that when the sodium content exceeds 1.5, the structure of PBAs will transfer from cubic phase to monoclinic phase. In terms of electrochemical performance, compared to cubic phase, monoclinic phase samples exhibit higher initial capacity, but lower rate capability and cycling performance, and their cycling stability deteriorates more severely with increasing sodium content. The cubic phase exhibits a more stable crystal structure compared to the monoclinic phase after cycling. During the charge-discharge process, the de-intercalation of excessive sodium ions in monoclinic PBAs leads to structural distortion, triggering the phase transition and resulting in the destruction of the crystal structure, which is the fundamental reason for the influence of sodium content on the electrochemical performance.																			0167-2738	1872-7689				MAR	2024	406								116462	10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116462		JAN 2024											WOS:001167853200001

Prepared Prussian blue nanodisk electrodes can significantly extend the longevity of Ca-based cells. The method involves precipitating 20-nm-thick nanodisks of Prussian green from Fe(NO3)(3) and K3Fe(CN)(6), followed by sodiation with NaI. The Prussian-blue-based cathode with polyacrylic acid/polyaniline binder delivers an initial discharging capacity of 77.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and retains 91.0% capacity after 700 cycles. Polyvinyl fluoride is detrimental to the Ca-based cell, as its coulombic efficiency decreases from 94.8% (120th cycle) to 86.4% (400th cycle). With the same cathode, the Ca-based cell is much less sensitive to high current densities than the Na-based cell. This can be because only half the amount of cations is required to move in Ca-based systems compared to Na-based systems; thus, the charge-transfer resistance is noticeably reduced in Ca-based systems.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) prepared by the conventional co-precipitation method, with a less active site density and a poor electrical transport, are often used as precursors for further preparation of PBA derivatives, such as metal oxides, metal alloys, metal phosphides, and so on, due to their poor OER activity. In this report, controllable synthesis of NiFe PBA with Fe2O3 byproducts on a Ni foam substrate was achieved through a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction by adjusting the amount of urea and potassium ferricyanide. After chemical etching and electrochemical activation, NiFe PBA was entirely transformed into amorphous superhydrophilic NiFe PBA (denoted a-NiHCF), which exhibited a remarkable OER performance at a large current density. To drive high current densities of 400 and 800 mA cm(-2), only ultralow overpotentials of 280 and 309 mV were required, respectively, which far exceed many recently reported OER catalysts. The superior performance can be attributed to the following: (1) in situ growth on a metal foam substrate can improve the structural stability and provide a faster charge transfer as well as oxygen bubble release; (2) chemical etching allows exposing more surface active sites; (3) an electrochemical activation-induced amorphous surface possesses a larger Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, more high-valent oxidation states, and higher intrinsic OER activity; and (4) the superhydrophilic surface structure is conducive to the adsorption of water molecules. These advantages make a-NiHCF a promising candidate for application in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting.					zhang, yujie/JAA-9367-2023; Wang, Tao/AAX-3905-2021														2168-0485					APR 26	2021	9	16					5693	5704		10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c00855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c00855		APR 2021											WOS:000644738000022

Their useful electrochemical properties include two independent redox centers per unit cell; a nanoporous, open framework for rapid ion conduction; high stability during ion (de) insertion; and structural and electrochemical tunability for diverse applications. Here we share insights into how control of the five main crystallographic features (two transition-metal ions, the inserting ion, defects, and water) imparts control over the ion-insertion reaction. We then identify five key opportunities to expand our understanding of these materials, including the role of water in their ion conduction, modeling, synthesis methods, use as anode materials, and technoeconomics.

Prussian blue (PB) is one of the most promising materials for constructing electrochemical H2O2-sensing devices; however, PB undergoes hydrolytic decomposition via the N-coordinated Fe(III) of the H2O2-sensing active Fe(II)-CN-Fe(III) moieties even in the weak basic condition of pH 8. In this study, it is anticipated that the homogeneously distributed Ni atoms in the partially Ni-displaced PB analog (Fe-Ni PBA, Fe1-xNix[Fe(CN)(6)](0.67)center dot nH(2)O) effectively block serious structural damage from hydrolytic decomposition. Fe-Ni PBA nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully prepared in all of the metal composition ratios between x = 0 and 1 and are stably dispersible into water by a surface modification method using [Fe(CN)(6)](4-). The spin-coated thin films composed of the Fe-Ni PBA NPs on ITO substrates function as an electrochemical H2O2 sensor even in the weak basic condition of pH 8, showing a linearity of the catalytic currents within the H2O2 concentrations between 2 x 10(-4) and 5 x 10(-3) mol/dm(3).

Herein a general strategy was employed to fabricate nanocomposites containing heterometallic oxide and graphene aerogel (GA) for the first time, in which Prussian blue analogue (PBA) was selected as self-sacrificial template for the preparation of metal oxide. The Fe-Co oxide nanocubes in the composite were homogeneously encapsulated in the network of GA, and meanwhile acted spacers separating adjacent graphene sheets. The as-prepared self-standing Fe-Co oxide@GA composite was used directly as excellent integrated anode material of lithium-ion batteries. More importantly, the composite electrode delivered an outstanding cycle stability with a specific capacity of 947 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after 130 cycles. Such superior Li-ion storage ability originates from the hierarchically encapsulated architecture and the strong synergistic effect between metal oxide and GA. The interconnected network of GA significantly improves the conductivity of the whole electrode as well as provides the space for buffering volume change of metal oxides, whereas metal oxides strongly wrapped within graphene nanosheets contribute large specific capacity.

Herein, four PBAs using iron and/or cobalt as the coordination metals were synthesized by coprecipitation method to investigate the degradation of diclofenac (DCF). Results showed that Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) (Co-Fe) and Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) (Co-Co) exhibited much better PMS activating capabilities than Fe-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) (Fe-Co) and Fe-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) (Fe-Fe). The optimum performance achieved by Co-Co/PMS resulted in a com-plete degradation of 0.1 mM (30 mg/L) DCF within 2 min under a broad pH range of 4-10. The leaching of Co2+ of both Co-Fe and Co-Co was more significant than that of Fe-Co, but the leaching of iron species was very low in all Fe-Containing PBAs. However, both homogeneous and heterogeneous mechanisms were assumed to contribute to DCF degradation, and the high spin state cobalt existing in Co-Fe and Co-Co that was linked to nitrogen was considered as main active site. Moreover, based on principal component analysis the most influ-ential parameter was the initial pH. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and quenching experiments exhibited that SO4 center dot-, O-1(2) and O-2(center dot-) all led to DCF degradation. The high-valent cobalt-oxo species [Co(IV)] was for the first time proposed in both Co-Fe/PMS and Co-Co/PMS processes, also contributing to DCF degradation. Additionally, Co-Co exhibited better reusability and DCF mineralization performance than Co-Fe.

Prussian blue (PB) is considered to be an excellent candidate for CDI intercalation electrode materials due to its spacious three-dimensional ion diffusion channels and available low-cost raw materials. However, the agglomerate tendency and inferior electronic conductivity of PB are the main factors which lead to lower capacity and poor cycling stability. Herein, a Prussian blue nanoparticle/carbon nanofiber (PB/CNF) composite material was synthesized by electrospinning and coprecipitation for capacitive deionization. The conductive CNFs bridged the PB nanoparticles with a size of ca. 50 nm to form a 3D conductive network structure, which can boost the diffusion kinetics of salt ions and electrons simultaneously in the PB/CNF electrode. The ion storage process by the combination of capacitance-controlled and diffusion-controlled behaviors allows the PB/CNF-5 composite to achieve a salt adsorption capacity (SAC) of 51.81 mg g(-1) in a 500 mg L-1 NaCl solution at 1.4 V, and it has excellent cycle stability for 80 cycles. Remarkably, it also shows an excellent salt adsorption performance of 97.35 mg g(-1) in a 3000 mg L-1 NaCl solution. Overall, the strategy of antiaggregation and enhanced electronic conductivity not only improved the desalination performance of PB nanoparticles but also provided a technical guideline for nanometer-sized materials and helped to facilitate better CDI electrode design.					ma, qingtao/ABB-7657-2020															2574-0970				MAY 17	2024	7	11					12970	12979		10.1021/acsanm.4c01534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.4c01534		MAY 2024											WOS:001227312800001

Compared to other PBAs, potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMnHCF) stands out for its superior capacity and operating voltage. However, Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ 3+ and the structural collapse caused by potassium ion insertion/ extraction still affect the structural stability and electrochemical performance of this material. Herein, a green and efficient synthesis method is adopted to substitute potassium ions in KMnHCF with an appropriate amount of cesium ions to form a column effect. Cesium-doped KMnHCF (Cs-KMnHCF) mitigates the irreversible structural damage caused by potassiation/depotassiation and the Jahn-Teller effect, thereby improving the cycling stability. In addition, it widens the lattice channels, reduces the diffusion barrier of potassium ions, and optimizes the diffusion kinetics. By rationally controlling the doping amount of Cs+, + , the obtained K1.71Cs0.05Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.95 center dot 0.05 center dot 0.88H2O 1.71 Cs 0.05 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ] 0.95 center dot 0.05 center dot 0.88H 2 O exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge capacity of 137.6 mA h g-1-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1 and a capacity retention of 89.6% after 600 cycles at 200 mA g-1.-1 . More importantly, when assembled with a pitch-derived soft carbon anode, the full cell manifests excellent cycle stability and rate performance.

Although considerable experimental efforts are focused on dehydrating water for capacity enhancement, there is still a deficiency of a comprehensive understanding of the low capacity of low-spin Fe resulting from interstitial water, which holds significance in Na+ storage. This study introduces a novel gas-assisted heat treatment method to efficiently remove interstitial water from Fe-based PBA (NaFeHCF) electrodes and combines experiments and theoretical calculations to reveal the iron spin state regulation that is related to the capacity enhancement mechanism. This dehydration strategy significantly enhances battery capacity, especially the portion at higher voltages (3.4-4.0 V). The increase in capacity is attributed to the following factors: an enhanced proportion of Fe2+, reduced water content which facilitates faster charge transfer, and the activation of low spin Fe2+. The optimized NaFeHCF demonstrated impressive half-cell performance of retaining 87.3% capacity after 2000 cycles at a 5 C rate and achieving 100 mAh g-1 capacity over 200 cycles when being paired with hard carbon, exhibiting its practical potential. A novel gas-assisted dehydration method for Prussian blue electrodes involves heating them in a flowing argon atmosphere, which effectively activates low-spin iron (LS-Fe) and significantly enhances the electrodes' capacity. This research reveals the impact of interstitial water in Prussian blue, providing support for its application. image					meng, Tianli/KZS-6791-2024														1613-6810	1613-6829				NOV	2024	20	46								10.1002/smll.202405822	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202405822		AUG 2024						39101605					WOS:001283446600001

Herein, this report focuses on the controllably morphological MoS2-doped NiS2/Co3S4 nanocubes which are derived from nickel-cobalt Prussian-blue analogs. After annealing in N-2 flow, MoS2/Ni-CoSx porous nanocubes are prepared via regulating the reactant ratios (1/2, 1/1 and 2/1) between (NH4)(2)MoS4 and Ni-Co Prussian-blue analogs. In the synthesis progress, (NH4)(2)MoS4 is applied as a bifunctional dopant source, which can expediently offer Mo and S elements simultaneously. The quaternary porous MoS2/Ni-CoSx (1/1) with the reasonable chemical composition, considerable specific surface area (86.7 m(2) g(-1)) and excellent electrocatalytic property can be selected as the representative counter electrode catalyst in dye-sensitized solar cells. Furthermore, the solar cell with MoS2/Ni-CoSx (1/1) exhibits a higher power conversion efficiency (9.80%) than that of Pt (8.19%) under a standard irradiation.

Currently, most kinetic energy harvesting systems are based on friction or deformation, which require high-frequency motion or high material durability for sustainable energy harvesting. Here, we introduce selective ion sweeping in a hybrid cell consisting of an ionadsorbing activated carbon and an ion-hosting Prussian blue analogue nanoparticle for electrochemical kinetic energy harvesting. The flow of electrolyte induced by kinetic motion of the cell causes ion sweeping only on the surface of the supercapacitor and induces current flow between the supercapacitor and the battery electrode. This method exhibits 24.9 mu W cm(-2) as maximum power of system with 34 Omega load in half-cell test, which is several thousand times smaller than the load used in conventional methods. In a long-term test with full cell, this method supplies a continuous current flow similar to 6 mu A cm(-2) at the flow of 40 mL min(-1) for 500 cycles without performance decay. The prototype of the hybrid cell demonstrated kinetic energy harvesting from bare hand press with the various flow speeds from 0.41 to 1.39 cm s(-1) as well as walking, running, and door closing, which are representative examples of low-frequency kinetic motions in daily life. We believe that the simple structure of the hybrid cell will enable power supply to various applications from miniaturized systems (e.g., IoTs and wearables) to large-scale systems (e.g., ocean wave energy harvesting).

However, the high water and vacancy content of PBAs lower their energy density and bring safety issues, impeding their large-scale application. Herein, a facile "potassium-ions assisted" strategy is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs. By manipulating the dominant crystal plane and suppressing vacancies, the as-prepared PBAs exhibit increased redox potential resulting in high energy density up to approximate to 450 Wh kg(-1), which is at the same level of the well-known LiFePO4 cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Remarkably, unconventional highly-reversible phase evolution and redox-active pairs were identified by multiple in situ techniques for the first time. The preferred guest-ion storage sites and migration mechanism were systematically analysed through theoretical calculations. We believe these results could inspire the design of safe with high energy density.

However, the introduction of other transition metals in diverse catalytic systems using a precisely controllable method has remained a great challenge. In this study, a facile strategy is proposed by using Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with tunable metal composition as a template to synthesize various Co-Fe molar ratios of spinel metal oxides. The iron-cobalt oxide (FeCo oxide) is successfully synthesized by utilizing thermal conversion of FeCo-based PBAs; the obtained oxide possessed a rough and porous structure with numerous interconnected granular nanoparticles formed in hollow multiple voids of each surface. In addition, the suitable iron contents occupying the octahedral sites in the spinel structure of FeCo oxide can further reduce the charge-transfer resistance and enhance the electrocatalytic activities toward OER. Benefiting from the unique structure and the chemical composition, the as-synthesized FeCo oxide shows an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a good stability for at least 12 h of operation in alkaline solution. These results suggest that the electrocatalytic activities can be optimized by controllable metal composition of the PBA-derived metal oxides, which are the promising electrocatalysts for OER application.

The Fe/Co ratio can affect the crystalline phase, particle size, and magnetic property of the FeCo alloy particles, as well as the relative graphitization degree of the carbon frameworks. As a result, the electromagnetic functions of these composites will be highly associated with the Fe/Co ratio, where high Co content is beneficial to the formation of strong dielectric loss and moderate Co content can facilitate the magnetic loss. When Fe/Co ratio reaches 1:1, the as-obtained composite (sample S4) displays excellent reflection loss characteristics with powerful absorption in a very broad frequency range (over -10 dB in 3.2-18.0 GHz), which is superior to those of single magnetic metal (Fe or Co)/carbon composite derived from PBAs, as well as many previously reported FeCo alloy/carbon composites. Electromagnetic analysis reveals that the excellent microwave absorption of sample S4 benefits from its preferable matching of characteristic impedance and good attenuation ability toward incident electromagnetic waves. These results provide new insight into the fabrication of carbon-based magnetic composites with enhanced microwave absorption by rationally manipulating the chemical composition of magnetic components.

Nevertheless, in the air cathode of the Mg-air battery, the slow dynamics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) seriously hinders its development and application. Herein, the Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with tunable chemical compositions and controllable morphology were used as precursors to prepare effective and stable ORR electrocatalysts for Mg-air batteries. The Fe@NC and bimetallic CoFe@NC electrocatalysts were derived from calcining FeFe-PBA and CoFe-PBA precursors at various temperatures under an argon atmosphere. Compared with an Fe@NC electrocatalyst, the bimetallic CoFe@NC electrocatalysts possess better ORR activities and stability under alkaline and neutral conditions. When the pyrolysis temperature was 600 degrees C, the CoFe@NC-600 displayed the best ORR activities. Meanwhile, the CoFe@NC-600 electrocatalyst exhibits the similar ORR reaction mechanism and activity compared to the Pt/C catalyst. After 5000 CV cycles in alkaline (0.1 M KOH) and neutral (3.5 wt % NaCl) electrolytes, the half-wave potentials of CoFe@NC-600 electrocatalyst merely appear at 2 and 5 mV negative deviations, respectively. Furthermore, the homemade Mg-air battery composed with CoFe@NC-600 exhibits superior discharge behaviors compared to that of the Mg-air battery assembled with Fe@NC. This research offers the groundwork for future research into the progress of nonprecious bimetallic ORR electrocatalysts for Mg-air battery.

More importantly, its ease of preparation makes it more suitable for practical application than other types of MOFs. The aim of this article is to provide an in-depth overview of the environmental remediation of PB/PBAs in Fenton-like advanced oxidation process (AOPs) (activation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and persulfate (PS, e.g., S2O82/HSO5)). First, common synthetic strategies for PB/PBAs-based materials are summarized. Then, the applications of PB/PBAs-based materials in the removal of organic matter and purification of wastewater by Fenton-like oxidation are discussed, with particular attention to their catalytic mechanisms and the identification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, unresolved chal-lenges and perspectives of the future are proposed. This review provides guidance for the future applica-tion and development of PB/PBA in advanced oxidation.

Besides, the 3D hierarchical structure can release more active sites and optimize the adsorption/ desorption energy of *OOH, *O, and *OH intermediates during the electrocatalytic process. In this study, the 3D heterostructure of NiFe-layered double hydroxides@etched Prussian blue analogue (NiFe-LDH@E-PBA) is prepared on nickel foam by electrodeposition and alkali etching processes. The alkali etching and the electrodeposition endow NiFe-LDH@E-PBA with abundant oxygen vacancies and plentiful active sites. The synergistic effect between NiFe-LDH and E-PBA offers efficient charge and mass transfer. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the interfacial electron transfer is conducive to the adsorption of OER intermediates. Hence, the catalyst displays outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance with a low overpotential of 263 mV at 100 mA cm- 2, a small Tafel slope of 34.78 mV dec-1, and robust durability with a stable operation over 50 h at 100 mA cm- 2. NiFe-LDH@E-PBA also demonstrates excellent alkaline overall water-splitting performance by acting as both the anode and the cathode. The cell voltages at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm- 2 are 1.65 and 1.80 V, respectively.

However, the inevitably high content of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies in the crystal structure results in a low salt adsorption capacity (SAC) and poor recycling performance. Herein, a high-salt nano-reaction system is established by mechanochemical ball milling, enabling the preparation of a variety of highly crystallized PBAs (metal hexacyanoferrate, MHCF-B-170, M = Ni, Co, or Cu) with low vacancies (0.05-0.06 per formula unit). The reduction of vacancies in the PBAs lattice not only strengthens the conductivity and promotes the rapid transfer of electrons, but also reduces the migration energy barrier and accelerates the fast and reversible diffusion of Na+ ions. The structural characterization method and theoretical simulation demonstrates the excellent reversibility and crystal structure stability of MHCF-B-170 during the CDI process. Impressively, the NiHCF-B-170 exhibits excellent CDI performance, characterized by an exceptionally high SAC of up to 101.4 mg g-1 at 1.2 V, and demonstrates remarkable cycle stability with no significant degradation observed even after 100 cycles.

Here, cobalt hexacyanocobaltate (Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)), a typical Prussian blue analog (PBA), is reported as an anode material for nonaqueous KIBs. The as-prepared Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 324.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1), a superior rate capability (221 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), and a favorable long-term cycling stability (200 cycles with 82% capacity retention). Based on a series of characterizations, it is found that potassiation/depotassiation in Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) proceeds via solid-state diffusion-limited K-ion insertion/extraction process, in which both carbon-and nitrogen-coordinated cobalt are electrochemically active toward K-ion storage. Finally, the reaction pathway between potassium and Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) is proposed.

Cost-effective Prussian blue analogue composite proton exchange membranes for low humidity fuel cell operation	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES												Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) exhibit reduced proton conductivity caused by severe dehydration under low relative humidity (RH), which is a pivotal bottleneck toward widespread commercialization of PEM fuel cells (PEMFCs). Previous PEM optimizing strategies have predominantly pursued increasing water uptake or enlarging hydrophilic domains, for which there is less focus on the mode of proton transport (Grotthuss or vehicular mechanisms) as the underlying reason. Here, a counterintuitive route is proposed by incorporating Cu-II[-Fe-III(CN)(6)](2/3) Prussian blue analogue (CuFe-PBA) additive, which possesses a hydrophobic framework. However, due to the ideal lattice length of CuFe-PBA, the lattice water molecules contained within this framework form well-connected hydrogen bond networks, which promote Grotthuss-type proton transport that is less dependent on RH conditions. Consequently, CuFe-PBA doped in sulfonated polysulfone (SPSf) matrix yields SPSf/CuFe-PBA composite PEMs showing better performance over unfilled PEM in both ex situ and in situ evaluations, especially under low RH conditions, which are competitive with Nafion 212.

Herein, a novel magnetic composite of carbon-based Fe-Co oxide (MCFC) was fabricated from a Prussian blue analogue and graphene oxide by pyrolysis in nitrogen and then re-sintering in air. MCFC showed good performance for several kinds of refractory drugs (including 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (ABEE), sulfamethoxazole and acyclovir) degradation by activation peroxymonosulfate (PMS), without any detectable metal leaching, as an important green environmental remediation technology. A slight performance decrease of MCFC observed during the reuse, was able to be recovered by a simple thermal process. No metal ions dissolution and thermal regeneration was an important development on PMS activation catalyst. Degradation intermediates of a refractory drug, ABEE, were identified by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The degradation pathways of ABEE were established, with intermediates being generated by the electrophilic/radical addition and the hydrogen abstraction. At last, PMS activation pathways was proposed as that PMS was activated by Co2+ and Fe2+ on the surface of MCFC, pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, and carbonyl groups, to form singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-). The synergistic effects between the metal nanocrystals and nitrogen-doped carbon promoted the regeneration of the surface Fe2+ and Co-2+,Co- which resulted in F4C6G5-6N-4a showing excellent catalytic activity for PMS activation. Through the above combination of non-radical (O-1(2)) and radical (SO4 center dot- and (OH)-O-center dot) processes, ABEE was degraded and mineralized. This work presents a promising green heterogeneous catalyst for the degradation of refractory drugs in municipal wastewater/groundwater by PMS activation.

The sensor was fabricated by modifying the electrode with NiFe prussian blue analogue (NiFe-PBA) and followed by SnS2, obtaining the dual-signal from [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) at 0.20 V and NiFe-PBA at 0.52 V. In the electropolymerization of the MIP film, ophenylenediamine was used as functional monomer and p-HAP acted as template molecule. After the adsorption of p-HAP, the two above oxidation peak currents decreased simultaneously compared with the elution, achieving the dual-signal analysis. Under the optimal conditions, the sensor exhibited a wide linear range of 10(-13) M to 10(- 7) M and a low detection limit of 3.52 x 10(-14) M (3 sigma). Moreover, it was successfully applied to the p-HAP detection in human serum and environment water samples with satisfactory recovery.					li, li/GPX-3938-2022														1385-8947	1873-3212				MAY 1	2022	435		2						134981	10.1016/j.cej.2022.134981	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2022.134981		FEB 2022											WOS:000773513600003

However, the relationship between the d-band center of the catalyst and the activation behavior of PDS remained largely unexplored. Herein, a series of Fe-Co PBAs-based catalysts with different Fe/Co ratios (Fe-Co PBAs-1 = 1: 0.52; Fe-Co PBAs-2 = 1: 1.21, and Fe-Co PBAs-3 = 1: 1.48) have been prepared by a facile hydrothermal procedure and subsequent acid treatment (Fe-Co PBAs-xH). The as-prepared Fe-Co PBAs-xH exhibited superior PDS activation performance and excellent recyclability in the degradation of methylene blue (MB). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the electron-occupied state of the Fe-Co PBAs was shifted to the Fermi level, indicating a strong interaction and easier electron transfer. Moreover, the d-band center of Fe-Co PBAs was upshifted relative to that of Fe PBAs, suggesting easier adsorption of MB and PDS, which was beneficial to enhancing catalytic activation and subsequent dissociation. Radicals such as center dot OH, O-1(2), O-2(center dot-), and SO4 center dot- were determined by the radical quenching experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) testing in the Fe-Co PBAs-3H/PDS system, and the order of MB degradation by the free active radical is center dot OH > O-1(2) > O-2(center dot-) > SO4 center dot-. The degradation pathway and potential ecotoxicity of MB and its intermediates were also studied. This work can provide new insights to construct the efficient catalysts for the activation of PDS and the degradation of organic pollutants.

Nevertheless, addressing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in RZAB requires highly active and robust electrocatalysts. High-entropy Prussian blue analogues (HEPBAs), formed by mixing diverse metals within a single lattice, exhibit enhanced stability due to their increased mixing entropy, which lowers the Gibbs free energy. HEPBAs innately enable sacrificial templating, an effective way to synthesize complex structures. Impressively, in this study, we successfully transform HEPBAs into exquisite multiphase (multimetallic alloy, metal carbide, and metal oxide) heterostructure nanoparticles through a controlled synthesis process. The elusive multiphase heterostructure nanoparticles manifested two active sites for selective ORR and OER. By integrating CNT into HEPBA-derived nanoparticles (HEPBA/CNT-800), the HEPBA/CNT-800 demonstrates superior activity toward both ORR (E 1/2 = 0.77 V) in a 0.1 M KOH solution and the OER (eta = 330 mV at 50 mA cm-2) in a 1 M KOH solution. The RZAB with a HEPBA/CNT-based air electrode demonstrated an open-circuit voltage of 1.39 V and provided a significant energy density of 71 mW cm-2. Moreover, the charge and discharge cycles lasting up to 40 h at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 demonstrate its excellent stability. This work provides an alternative avenue for the rational design of HEPBA's derivative for a sustainable rechargeable metal-air battery platform.

In this study, Zn-PBA nanoparticles were integrated onto polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanorods to form PBA-PCN hybrid via hydrothermal pre-anchoring and in-situ growth method. The robust and amino-rich PCN played dual roles in securely anchoring the Zn2+ precursor and attracting Cs+ to the surface. Benefiting from the effects of PCN and in-situ generated PBA, PBA-PCN exhibited boosting postseparation performance and water stability in acid and alkaline solutions, which was attractive in different application scenarios. Moreover, PBA-PCN has been demonstrated to be with high adsorption capacity of 376.41 mg/g and favorable selectivity even in the presence of excessive competitive ions. The experimental results and DFT calculations suggested the adsorption mechanism involving strong incorporation/ion exchange and weak electrostatic attraction. The remarkable adsorption performance along with the satisfactory post-separation performance and water stability made it a promising candidate in Cs+ removal and separation.

Unfortunately, these materials are electrically insulating, which results in adverse effects on their electrochemical performance, such as limited practical capacity and rate capability. In this study, we demonstrate a simple overlaying of a conductive polymer- poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate)-on the surface of Prussian blue nanocubes at room temperature, with the aim to secure sufficient electrical conduction pathways and, by extension, improve the electrochemical performance of the nanocubes. The proposed surface-engineered Prussian blue nanocubes with 3.0 wt% poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) show a high reversible capacity (130.9 mA g(-1)) with stable cycle performance. Moreover, they exhibit a reversible capacity of approximately 112.6 mAh g(-1) at the high rate of 1220 mA g(-1), which corresponds to 86.0% of the capacity obtained at a current density of 12.2 mA g(-1). Such improvements are mainly attributed to the formation of additional networks of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) that facilitate electric conduction in the electrode. Our proposed approach could be a practical solution to improving the electrochemical properties of Prussian blue and its analogues as potential cathode materials for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.

This work aims to elucidate the structure of a series of Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue modified ZnO (PBA/ZnO) electrodes with interface-sensitive vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy. Our measurements revealed, for the first time, a cyanide linkage isomerism at the PBA/ZnO interface, when the composite is fabricated at elevated temperatures. In situ VSFG spectro-electrochemistry measurements correlate the CoII -> CoIII oxidation with the flip of the bridging CN ligand from Co-NC-Fe coordination mode to a Co-CN-Fe one. Photoluminescence measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that this unprecedented linkage isomerism originates from surface defects, which act as oxidation sites for the PBA. The presence of such surface defects is correlated with the fabrication temperature for PBA/ZnO. Thus, this contribution identifies the interplay between the surface states of the ZnO substrates and the chemical composition of PBA at the ZnO surface, suggesting an easily accessible approach to control the chemical composition of the interface. VSFG spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry reveals critical interplay between interfacial oxidation and cyanide flip in Co-Fe Prussian Blue/ZnO heterostructure. Tuning the fabrication temperature for such heterostructure gives access to an easily accessible approach for controlling interfacial composition. This work shows that co-operativity at the molecular level facilitate kinetically demanding chemical processes at such interfaces. image					Oschatz, Martin/B-1239-2015; Karadas, Ferdi/D-7140-2012; Bera, Anupam/CAF-3824-2022; PHUL, RUBY/J-4256-2016	Bera, Anupam/0000-0003-4338-9637; PHUL, RUBY/0000-0003-3269-4951; Plentz, Jonathan/0000-0003-1176-0710													0947-6539	1521-3765				OCT 28	2024	30	60								10.1002/chem.202401708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.202401708		OCT 2024						39140426					WOS:001332306400001

Herein, this work demonstrates a facile low-temperature ion exchange method to synthesize Mn and Fe co-loaded Prussian blue analogues possessing core-shell structured frameworks and favorable water-tolerance. Among the catalysts prepared, the optimal HMPB-2.6Mn shows a high ORR electrocatalytic performance featuring a half-wave potential of 0.86 V and zinc-air battery power density of 119 mW cm-2, as well as negligible degradation up to 60 h, which are comparable to commercial Pt/C. Such an excellent electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the special core-shell-like structure with Mn concentrated in outer shell, and the synergetic interactions between Mn and Fe, endowing HMPB-Mn with outstanding ORR activity and good stability. A HMPB-Mn structure with water-tolerant character that shows core-shell-like composition distribution where Mn and Fe are simultaneously located in the outer layer of HMPB-Mn and the inner layer is mainly composed of Fe is reported in this work, as well as the synergetic interactions between Mn and Fe, endowing HMPB-Mn outstanding ORR activity and good stability concurrently.image					, jianlin Shi/HTM-8889-2023; Yu, Ziyi/LTD-4688-2024														1864-5631	1864-564X				FEB 8	2024	17	3								10.1002/cssc.202301265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202301265		NOV 2023						37799013					WOS:001097314400001

The high conductivity and large surface area of NF could accelerate electron transmission and increase the number of active sites. Fe incorporation could also enhance electronic structure and optimize adsorbate energy. The obtained CoFe-P/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER in 1 M KOH, which only provides overpotentials of 264 and 278 mV at current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm-2, respectively, and exhibits excellent durability over 120 h.

However, the desalination performances of PBAs are hampered by their sluggish intrinsic kinetics and insufficient utilization of active sites. Herein, we demonstrate an advanced hybrid material constructed by anchoring nickel hexacyanoferrate (Ni-PBA) onto three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped porous carbon (ZC) derived from zinc-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, ZIF-8) poly-hedron. ZC with a 3D open structure not only provides multiple spatial supports for the in-situ growth of Ni-PBA with extraordinary redox capacity, but also features high electrical conductivity, excellent hydrophilicity and large surface area to facilitate the electron/ion transport and improve the ion accommodation. Therefore, the Ni-PBA/ZC composite electrode achieves an outstanding CDI desalination performance with an ultrahigh salt adsorption capacity (SAC) of 43.9 mg g-1 and maximum salt adsorption rate (mSAR) of 20.82 mg g-1 min-1, outperforming those of most of the recently reported MOF-derived porous carbon materials and PBAs-based materials.

Herein, the effect of Ni:K atomic ratio on the structure and the CO2 storage capacity was studied by employing K-NiFe-PBAs with Ni:K ratio of ca. 2.5 and 12. The porosity and the isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption can be modulated and optimized by varying the Ni:K atomic ratio in the PB framework and thus, covering the thermodynamic criterion for easy CO2 capture and release with acceptable energy costs. The synthesized K-NiFe-PBAs containing only trace amounts of K+ ions (with Ni:K = 12) shows an adsorption capacity (similar to 3.0 mmol g(-1) CO2 at 273 K and 100 kPa) comparable to other well established CO2 adsorbents. In situ FTIR spectroscopy was further employed to elucidate the host-guest interaction chemistry and the dynamics of K-NiFe-PBAs within CO2 and H2O. The analysis enabled, to the best of our knowledge, is the first FTIR spectroscopic observation of the high sensitivity of the material to structural distortions induced by small changes under water vapor pressure.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were used to investigate the electrochemical behavior and mechanism of the fabricated biosensor. Experimental results showed that Cu-Co PBA/MWCNTs/GCE had excellent electrochemical activity towards nitrite, which was superior to that of Cu-Co PBA and MWCNTs. Under the optimal conditions, a wide linear range from 10. 400 mu M and 400. 2100 mu M and a detection limit of 0.5 mu M were obtained. Moreover, this sensor was employed to determine the concentration of nitrite in ham sausage and mustard samples, and showed excellent selectivity, good anti-interference, repeatability and satisfied recovery.																			0253-3820	1872-2040				JUN	2019	47	6								10.1016/S1872-2040(19)61168-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1872-2040(19)61168-0													WOS:000470983800002
J	Ren, AJ; Yu, B; Liu, ZC				Ren, Ajing; Yu, Bo; Liu, Zhicheng			Prussian blue analog-derived bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles anchored in nitrogen-doped porous electrospun carbon nanofibers for efficient oxygen evolution reaction	APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY												Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) and their derivatives have been extensively investigated as potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts due to their high specific surface areas, adjustable composition, and controllable morphology, yet they suffer from easy aggregation and poor electrical conductivity. Herein, we successfully synthesized PBA-derived NiFe bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles encapsulated in porous nitrogen-doped electrospun carbon nanofibers by sequential electrospinning, carbonization, and phosphorization. By exploring the effects of different phosphating temperatures on electrocatalytic performance, the obtained electrocatalyst possesses a low overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for OER in 1.0 M KOH. The electrospun carbon nanofibers can not only address the problem of poor electrical conductivity of PBA derivatives but also provide confinement effect, which could reduce PBA aggregation and collapse. Furthermore, the coupling effect of porous nitrogen-doped electrospun carbon nanofibers and PBA-derived bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles facilitates sufficient exposure of active species, expedites electron transfer, accelerates reaction kinetics, and improves durability. The PBA-derived bimetallic NiFeP@CNF addresses the issues of low conductivity and easy aggregation of PBA due to the introduction of electrospun carbon nanofibers, facilitating the active specie exposure and electron transfer, thus boosting OER performance.image					Liu, Zhi-Cheng/O-6812-2019														0268-2605	1099-0739				DEC	2023	37	12								10.1002/aoc.7295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aoc.7295		OCT 2023											WOS:001087836500001

Here, cobalt hexacyanocobaltate (Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)), a typical Prussian blue analog (PBA), is reported as an anode material for nonaqueous KIBs. The as-prepared Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 324.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1), a superior rate capability (221 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), and a favorable long-term cycling stability (200 cycles with 82% capacity retention). Based on a series of characterizations, it is found that potassiation/depotassiation in Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) proceeds via solid-state diffusion-limited K-ion insertion/extraction process, in which both carbon-and nitrogen-coordinated cobalt are electrochemically active toward K-ion storage. Finally, the reaction pathway between potassium and Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) is proposed. The present study provides new insights on further exploration of PBAs as high-performance electrode materials for KIBs.					zhu, yujie/KBC-4009-2024														0935-9648	1521-4095				AUG 2	2018	30	31																						WOS:000443807400007

However, their electrochemical performance suffers from poor cycle life associated with chemo-mechanical instabilities. This study investigates the driving forces behind chemo-mechanical instabilities in Ni- and Mn-based PBAs cathodes for K-ion batteries by combining electrochemical analysis, digital image correlation, and spectroscopy techniques. Capacity retention in Ni-based PBA is 96% whereas it is 91.5% for Mn-based PBA after 100 cycles at C/5 rate. During charge, the potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate (KNHCF) electrode experiences a positive strain generation whereas the potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) electrode undergoes initially positive strain generation followed by a reduction in strains at a higher state of charge. Overall, both cathodes undergo similar reversible electrochemical strains in each charge-discharge cycle. There is similar to 0.80% irreversible strain generation in both cathodes after 5 cycles. XPS studies indicated richer organic layer compounds in the cathode-electrolyte interface (CEI) layer formed on KMHCF cathodes compared to the KNHCF ones. Faster capacity fades in Mn-based PBA, compared to Ni-based ones, is attributed to the formation of richer organic compounds in CEI layers, rather than mechanical deformations. Understanding the driving forces behind instabilities provides a guideline to develop material-based strategies for better electrochemical performance.

Advances of Prussian blue and its analogues in (bio)sensors	CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY												The aim of the present article is to review the current state of knowledge concerning advances of Prussian blue and its analogues in chemical and biological sensors. Despite deposition of these materials has been already discussed, an appearance of recent articles presenting poorly synthesized transition metal hexacyanoferrates, causes review of the synthetic procedures. The significance of Prussian blue for (bio)sensors is provided by its unique catalytic properties: both catalytic activity and selectivity in hydrogen peroxide reduction are > 1000 times higher compared to platinum, whereas clinical analyzers and low-invasive monitors are equipped with Pt-based biosensors. Non-iron (nickel, cobalt, cupric etc.) hexacyanoferrates are catalytically inactive, however, they are highly attractive for stabilization of Prussian blue resulting in synthesis of the 'super-stable' Prussian blue-based electrocatalyst. The protocol for enzyme immobilization from water-organic mixtures with a high content of organic solvent is discussed. Combination of the most advantageous electrocatalyst (Prussian blue) and the improved immobilization protocol results in elaboration of the advanced biosensors. Their unique sensitivity, selectivity and operational stability (even compared with platinum-based ones) provide application for non-invasive diagnostics.

C.; Fang, Feng; Jiang, Jianqing			Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance in Prussian Blue Analogues: Triple-Play of Metal Exsolution, Hollow Interiors, and Anionic Regulation	ADVANCED MATERIALS												Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising catalysts for green hydrogen production. However, the rational design of high-performing PBAs is challenging, which requires an in-depth understanding of the catalytic mechanism. Here FeMn@CoNi core-shell PBAs are employed as precursors, together with Se powders, in low-temperature pyrolysis in an argon atmosphere. This synthesis method enables the partial dissociation of inner FeMn PBAs that results in hollow interiors, Ni nanoparticles (NPs) exsolution to the surface, and Se incorporation onto the PBA shell. The resulting material presents ultralow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (184 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and low Tafel slope (43.4 mV dec-1), outperforming leading-edge PBA-based electrocatalysts. The mechanism responsible for such a high OER activity is revealed, assisted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the surface examination before and after the OER process. The exsolved Ni NPs are found to help turn the PBAs into Se-doped core-shell metal oxyhydroxides during the OER, in which the heterojunction with Ni and the Se incorporation are combined to improve the OER kinetics. This work shows that efficient OER catalysts could be developed by using a novel synthesis method backed up by a sound understanding and control of the catalytic pathway. Hierarchical hollow core-shell FeMn@CoNi-Se PBA materials with metallic Ni NPs loading can be synthesized via low-temperature thermal treatment. The prepared PBA-Se 350 displays outstanding catalytic performance and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution, superior to commercial catalysts.image					Huo, Wenyi/AAM-5936-2021; Fang, Feng/L-7518-2019; Camargo, Pedro/L-3773-2019; Wang, Shiqi/KHT-9683-2024; Camargo, Pedro/D-9547-2011	Huo, Wenyi/0000-0001-8297-9045; Formo, Eric/0000-0002-5604-4884; Camargo, Pedro/0000-0002-7815-7919; Shiqi, Wang/0000-0002-4373-6451													0935-9648	1521-4095				NOV	2023	35	45								10.1002/adma.202304494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.202304494		OCT 2023						37473821					WOS:001078343600001

These catalyst precursors were applied in the CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols at 260 & DEG;C and a pressure of 60 bar using a H-2/CO ratio of 1. Metallic Co-0 formed during pyrolysis was partially transformed into Co2C under reaction conditions. With increasing Co content CO conversion increased up to 10.6 % reaching a total alcohol selectivity of 19 %. Gas chromatograms revealed the expected formation of primary short-chain alcohols, but also of secondary alcohols, acetic acid and propionaldehyde indicating olefin hydration, carbonylation and hydroformylation as reaction pathways, respectively. The obtained hydrocarbon fractions had a very high olefinicity, which is beneficial for both olefin hydration to secondary alcohols catalyzed by adsorbed carboxylic acids and for hydroformylation. Whereas the carbide-based reaction pathway and the reductive hydroformylation are assumed to occur at the Co2C/Co-0 interface, carbonylation is presumably catalyzed by an additional Co-based active site. Thus, a unique class of multifunctional catalysts was obtained with highly promising properties bridging the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.

Our results suggest that Prussian blue nanorods exhibited better adsorption performance than co-precipitation PB or Prussian blue analogue composites. Thermodynamic analysis implied that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic which was described well with the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order equation. The maximum adsorption capacity of PB nanorod was estimated to be 194.26 mg g(-1) and 256.62 mg g(-1) for Cs+ and Sr2+(adsorbate concentration at 500 mg L-1, the temperature at 298 k, pH at 7.0). Moreover, the experimental results showed that the Prussian blue nanorods have high crystallinity, few crystal defects, and good stability under alkaline conditions. The adsorption mechanism of Cs+ and Sr2+ was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy. The results revealed that Cs+ entered the PB crystal to generate a new phase, and most of Sr2+ was trapped in the internal crystal and the other exchanged Fe2+. Furthermore, the effect of co-existing ions and pH on PB adsorption process was also investigated. The results suggest that PB nanorods were an outstanding candidate for removing Cs+ and Sr2+ from radioactive wastewater.

Herein, a photothermal adsorbent of composite aerogel with three-dimensional porous structure is fabricated by integrating prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and straw biochar into the chitosan (CS) and waste leather scrap hydrolysate (WLSH) aerogel matrix (CS/ WLSH/C/PBAs). The local heating effect generated by CS/WLSH/C/PBAs aerogel induce to generate steam, accelerating the enrichment of Cs+ and Sr2+ in the solution, which increase their interaction with the CS/WLSH/ C/PBAs and improves their adsorption rates and capacities. Under simulated sunlight, the adsorption equilibrium times for Cs+ and Sr2+ by CS/WLSH/C/PBAs are shortened from 5 h in the dark condition to 2 h, with maximum adsorption capacities of 156.0 and 95.1 mg/g for Cs+ and Sr2+, respectively. Meanwhile, the CS/WLSH/C/PBAs aerogel also exhibits excellent reusability. Notably, the Cs+ and Sr2+ still can be efficiently removed in simulated seawater. Encouragingly, the CS/WLSH/C/PBAs aerogel also exhibits excellent adsorption properties for dyes and oils. This work provides insights for the design of multifunctional and efficient composite adsorbents, and paving a promising way for enhancing the adsorption of Cs+ and Sr2+ through solar energy.

Octahedral tilting in Prussian blue analogues	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C												Octahedral tilting is key to the structure and functionality of perovskites. We present a metastudy of published literature showing how these distortions manifest in the related Prussian blue analogues (PBAs): cyanide versions of double perovskites with formula AM[M '(CN)(6)](1-y)(y)center dot nH(2)O (A = alkali metal, M and M ' = transition metals, = vacancy/defect). Tilts are favoured by high values of x if A = Na or K, whereas the transition metals play a less important role. External hydrostatic pressure induces tilt transitions nearly irrespective of the stoichiometry, whereas thermal transitions are only reported for x > 1. Interstitial water can alter the transitions induced by a different stimulus, but (de)hydration per se does not lead to tilts. Finally, the implications for rational design of critical functionality-including improper ferroelectricity and electrochemical performance-are discussed. The results are integral for a fundamental understanding of phase transitions and for the development of functional materials based on PBAs.

With the rapid development of nanozymes in various fields, it is highly desirable but challenging to develop LPMO-like nanozymes with high specificity and satisfied activity. Here, a defective copper-cobalt binuclear Prussian blue analogue (CuCoPBA) nanozyme was developed via a facile and ingenious methodology based on single histidine (His). For the first time, HisCuCoPBA nanozyme was found to exhibit LPMO-like activity with H2O2 as a cosubstrate at room temperature and neutral pH, which can efficiently catalyze the degradation of galactomannans selectively. Significantly, the high degradation activity at pH 10 expands the application of Fenton-like nanozymes in alkaline condition. Singlet oxygen (1O2), as a main reactive intermediate, plays a crucial role in the galactomannan degradation catalyzed by His-CuCoPBA nanozyme. Both control experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results indicate Cu-NxHis contributes to the efficiently and selectively catalytic activity of His-CuCoPBA nanozymes by emulating the binding and catalytic sites of LPMOs. The present work not only represents a fundamental breakthrough toward degradation of polysaccharide based on nanozyme, but also contributes to understanding the catalytic mechanism of natural Cu-dependent LPMOs.

Starting from Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with special advantages, the trimetallic hollow structural Co-Fe-P/Cu3P/CF covered with extended nanosheets grown on nanorods was synthesized via ion exchange and calcination approaches in this study. The overpotential of the prepared electrode was only 205 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm  2, and it can maintain the stable catalytic activity for at least 60 h. The prominent electric performance is mainly attributed to the construction of the unique morphology, in which the rod-shaped structure can promote the transportation of the reactants, and the hollow structure as well as the nanosheets outside can expand the specific surface area. The electronic interaction between multiple metals can also improve the conductivity of the catalyst. The characterization analysis of the post electrode after long-term oxygen evolution reaction imply that the surface of the catalytic electrode was partially oxidized to the corresponding oxide, which can generate the new active sites to maintain the high catalytic activity together with the residual phosphide. Our research might provide a new reference for the deep exploration of PBA-based materials applied in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

Secondly, metal-like cocatalysts have a strong attraction to the charges generated by light, forcing electron hole separation and exacerbating this effect under illumination. This has been strongly demonstrated through a series of characterizations and in -situ radiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In summary, this study provides a reliable and clear understanding for the modification of Prussian blue analogues and the regulation of photo induced charge transfer by metal-like cocatalysts.					li, feiyang/KHW-5210-2024; Xie, Haiyan/HTL-4822-2023														0360-3199	1879-3487				APR 3	2024	61						296	306		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.02.265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.02.265		MAR 2024											WOS:001200397100001

In this work, by utilizing a Prussian blue analogue as functional precursors, small Fe-doped CoS2 nanoparticles spatially confined in N-doped carbon spheres with rich porosity were synthesized through facile successive precipitation, carbonization, and sulfurization processes, leading to the formation of bayberry-like Fe-doped CoS2/N-doped carbon spheres (Fe-CoS2/NC). By introducing a suitable amount of FeCl3 in the starting materials, the optimal Fe-CoS2/NC hybrid spheres with the designed composition and pore structure exhibited superior cycling stability (621 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 1 A g(-1)) and improved the rate capability (493 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)). This work provides a new avenue for the rational design and synthesis of high performance metal sulfide-based anode materials toward SIBs.

Elevating the Performance of the Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode for Sodium-Ion Batteries by Adjusting the Low Spin Fe Redox	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS												Prussian blue and its analogues (PB and PBAs) belong to a group of metal-organic frameworks that are ideal cathodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their open framework, which is kinetically suitable for intercalating ions and the ease of large-scale production with low cost. However, vacancies are generated during the coprecipitation methods, and driving the interstitial water to occupy these spaces adversely affects the electrochemical performance of SIBs. In this work, we synthesized iron hexacyanoferrate (Fe[Fe(CN)(6)]) PBA via the self-decomposition method under a protective environment, suppressing vacancy formation. Further, a one-step ion exchange process was developed to introduce cobalt ions into the Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] crystal structure. The synthesized material was utilized as a cathode for a SIB, which delivered a specific capacity of 160 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of 10 mA g(-1). Benefiting from structural advantages the cell successfully shows a stable performance up to 300 cycles with 89% retention of its first capacity.

However, their inferior charge transfer ability constrains further performance improvement. In this work, a facile strategy is reported to fabricate Co2P/Ni2P/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite from a precursor Co-Ni Prussian blue analogue. The combination of Co2P/Ni2P and CNT endows Co2P/Ni2P/CNT with improved electrical conductivity and a richer electrochemically active surface area. As a result, the Co2P/Ni2P/CNT composite exhibits desirable HER activities across a wide pH range, delivering a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials as low as 151 and 202 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively, as well as remarkable electrocatalytic stabilities over 48 h in both electrolytes. This strategy enables the design of high-performance electrocatalysts for efficient and stable hydrogen generation. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, Ni-PB has a low theoretical capacity of 85 mAh g(-1) because of the electrochemical inertness of Ni. Herein, ternary Ni-PB is successfully synthesized by double doping with Co and Fe at Ni-site, and the effect of doping with Co and Fe on the electrochemical performance of Ni-PB is systematically investigated through theoretical calculations and electrochemical tests. The first principles calculations confirm that double doping with Co and Fe can significantly reduce the energy barrier and bandgap of Ni-PB. X-ray diffraction and composition analysis results indicate that ternary NiCoFe-PB composite not only has good crystallinity and high Na content but also has low defects and crystal water. Electrochemical tests reveal that, besides the capacity contribution of high-spin Co/Fe and low-spin Fe, Co-doping enhances the electrochemical activity of low-spin Fe and Fe-doping improves the activity of high-spin Co; moreover, double doping can decrease the diffusion resistance of Na+ ions through solid electrolyte interface film, accelerate the kinetics for both ion diffusion process and Faradic reaction, and increase active sites. Under the synergistic effect of Co and Fe, this ternary NiCoFe-PB exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 120.4 mAh g(-1) at 20 mA g(-1) and an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0044% per cycle at a high current density of 2 A g(-1) even after 10,000 cycles, showing great application potential of ternary NiCoFe-PB in the field of large-scale energy storage.

In this study, three bimetallic Prussian blue analogues (PBA) and six corresponding oxides are prepared by co -precipitation and calcination methods, and then utilized to adsorb aqueous Yb(III) solution. The results of XRD, SEM, BET, and XPS indicate the successful synthesis of all the adsorbents. Among them, three PBA-oxide samples (PBO-800) exhibit the superior adsorption capacities (??250 mg/g). The adsorption processes of Yb(III) are in accordance with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model, simultaneously showing the spontaneous and endothermic thermodynamics. Moreover, PBO-800 can be reused after alkaline solution regeneration with less than 10% degradation after five consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. More impor-tantly, PBO-800 exhibits the impressive separation selectivity of Yb(III) and most light rare earth ions (e.g., 5.51 of Yb/La, 4.03 of Yb/Pr), as well as the selectivity of Yb(III) and alkali metal ions (e.g., 300.5 of Yb/Na, 256.2 of Yb/Ca). According to the characterization analysis and DFT calculation, the adsorption mechanism of Yb(III) by PBO-800 is mainly attributed to the strong interaction between the abundant active-oxygen sites and Yb(III), and the significant electrostatic attraction.

Both the rational design of nano-MOFs with sophisticated structures and the comprehensive knowledge of their formation mechanism remain an interesting research topic. In this work, we reported a highly peculiar zigzag crystal of a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) bearing the ensemble of walls with uniform thickness (similar to 60 nm) in three-dimensional space. Such "Z"-like PBA was acquired by the preferential etching of two opposing corners of its parent NiCo-PBA cubes that was pre-doped by metal ligand ions (i. e., [Fe(CN)(6)](3-)). Mechanistic studies suggested that the anisotropic etching seemed to arise from the heterogeneous growth and inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the FeIII and FeII (stemming from redox reaction of FeIII) species, even though all the metal elements (including Fe, Co, and Ni) were evenly dispersed in each individual cube as indicated by HAADF-STEM and linear EDS scan analyses. The open "Z" structure provided larger surface area and a greater number of active sites to activate reagents in catalytic reaction and enhanced the degradation efficiency in removing bisphenol A from aqueous solution with PMS. The current findings are expected to pave way for a fine tuning the structures and properties of MOFs, and encourage extended research on developing novel anisotropic crystals.

Herein, we first fabricated a self-standing bimetallic FeCo Prussian blue analogue nanosheet array (FeCo PBA) on Ni foam through ion exchange between K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] and hydrothermal synthesized Co-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O nanosheet arrays. Then the obtained FeCo PBA were facilely transformed into FeCo/C and FeCoP/C nanosheet arrays through hydrogenation and phosphidation, respectively. Benefiting from the enhanced mass transfer in porous structure, the intimate contact with Ni framework and the synergistic effect of bimetal sites, the resultant FeCo/C NS and FeCoP/C NS demonstrate superior oxygen and hydrogen evolution activity in alkaline media, respectively. Impressively, a low cell voltage of 1.55 V is sufficient to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) by coupling FeCo/C NS and FeCoP/C NS in a two-electrode water splitting electrolyzer, surpassing the performance of PtC based couple (V-cell,V-10 = 1.60 V).

For developing an effective alternative approach for reducing bromate, cobalt and nickel-based Prussian Blue (PB) analogues are proposed here for incorporating a convenient reducing agent, NaBH4 (i.e., a H-2-rich reagent) for reducing bromate to bromide as cobalt and nickel are recognized as effective metals for catalyzing hydrolysis of NaBH4, and PB exhibits versatile catalytic activity. While CoPB and NiPB are comprised of the same crystalline structure, CoPB exhibits slightly higher specific surface area, more reductive surface, and more superior electron transfer than NiPB, enabling CoPB to accelerate bromate reduction. CoPB also exhibits a higher affinity towards NaBH4 than NiPB based on density functional theory calculations. Moreover, CoPB also exhibits a relatively low activation energy (i.e., 59.5 kJ/mol) of bromate reduction than NiPB (i.e., 63.2 kJ/mol). Furthermore, bromate reduction by CoPB and NiPB could be also considerably enhanced under acidic conditions, and CoPB and NiPB could still effectively remove bromate even in the presence of nitrate, sulfate and phosphate. CoPB and NiPB are also validated to be recyclable for reducing bromate, indicating that CoPB and NiPB are promising heterogeneous catalysts for reducing bromate.

However, they exhibited a low specific capacity and a poor cycle performance. In this work, crystalline potassium iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) with dislocation was designed and prepared by a poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) additive. The metastable state provided by PVP would cause an electrostatic interaction between cyanogen and water molecules. The reduced force increases the steric resistance of the water molecules entering the crystal. The low content of crystal water in FeHCF is associated with the formation of dislocation. The dislocation effect effectively improves the electrochemical reactivity and reaction kinetics of FeHCF. Thus, it presents a high reversible capacity of 131 mAh g(-1) with a superior capacity retention of 85% after 550 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). When used as a cathode, the AZBs display a high voltage of 2.6 V, a fast charging capability (<5 min), and a satisfactory cycle stability with a capacity retention of 82% after 400 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1) in decoupling electrolytes. This work provides an effective strategy for the design of high-performance PBA-based cathodes for 2.6 V AZBs.

Herein, an innovative strategy is demonstrated to prepare PBA nanoarchitectures on various metal substrates. The interfacial redox reactions between metal cyanide ions and metal substrate result in the formation of desirable PBA nanostructures via the in situ precipitation process. Furthermore, the morphology and growth rates of PBAs can be readily regulated by changing the pH value of the reaction solution. The obtained PBA nanostructures can be transformed into the corresponding metal oxides via the simple thermal treatment. More importantly, the hollow oxide derivative manifests considerable catalytic activity with a low potential of 1.53 V to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and impressive prolonged durability over 600 h.

Besides, the rate capability of PBAs is limited due to their poor electrical conductivity. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to tune the physical and chemical properties of PBAs at the nano regime without affecting the inherent charge storage properties, especially at high-voltage operating conditions. Through this work, a strategy is demonstrated to enhance the electrochemical performance of vanadium-based PBA (V-PBA) by surface engineering using a conducting polymer nano-skin (V-PBA/PPy) for aqueous zinc metal batteries. The polypyrrole (PPy) nano-skin over the V-PBA nanoparticles acts as an electron percolation path to ameliorate the poor electronic conductivity of the otherwise pristine V-PBA. Interestingly, the V-PBA with an optimized polypyrrole coating (V-PBA/PPy-2) exhibits an enhanced specific capacity (173 mAh g-1 at 0.10 A g-1) than the pristine V-PBA counterpart (80 mAh g-1) and 85% capacity retention up to 500 cycles. The DFT calculation confirms the synergistic interaction between PPy and V-PBA and the presence of PPy favors the adsorption of Zn.

Meanwhile, the obstacle originating from the slow 4-electron-involved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pushes the urgency to create efficient, durable, earth-abundant electrocatalysts. As one of the promising candidates, it remains a challenge to enhance the reactivity of the Prussian-blue analogue (PBA) towards the OER. Herein, we propose a unique tandem surface reconstruction strategy for NiFe PBA followed by heteroatomic F doping and graphene quantum dot (GQD) decoration to modify the surface chemistry. GQD could improve electrocatalytic performance through the higher transition metal interaction with NiFe PBA due to the distinct electronic structures and an abundance of edge sites. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that F- ions were more likely to affect metal bonds. In contrast, GQD plays a role in modifying the metal states through the higher transition metal interaction. The proposed GQD/F-NiFe PBA with tandem surface engineering demonstrated promising electrocatalytic activity for OER in an alkaline medium, with an overpotential of 318 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 34.7 mV dec-1.

This study presents a solid-state ASC using CoCuFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as the positive electrode and hydrothermally grown Vanadium MXene (V2C) as the negative electrode. SEM analysis reveals CoCuFe PBA's coagulated skeleton-like structure and V2C MXene's nanosheetlike morphology. In a three-electrode configuration, CoCuFe PBA shows a specific capacitance of 441 F/g at 0.8 A/g (0 to 0.5 V), while V2C MXene achieves 243 F/g at -1 to 0 V with a 2 M KOH electrolyte. The CoCuFe PBA//V2C ASC device achieves 185 F/g at 1 A/g with a PVA-KOH electrolyte at 1.5 V. This combination facilitates rapid ion diffusion, yielding an energy density of 57.8 Wh/kg and a power density of 1500 W/kg. The device also retains 82 % of its capacitance after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at 6 A/g, demonstrating excellent stability and potential for high-performance supercapacitors.

Olof			Electrochromic bilayers of Prussian blue and its Cr analogue	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C												Multilayered thin films of functional materials play an important role in many applications in nanotechnology. The intense and tuneable colours of some molecular materials allow for the development of a unique spectral fingerprint of each layer in thin film heterostructures. Herein, we report on electrochromic switching of bilayer thin films composed of Prussian blue ((FeFeII)-Fe-III) and its orange-coloured ((FeCrIII)-Cr-II) analogue. The films could be switched from green to orange by reducing the blue FeFe top layer. The distinct optical absorption spectra of the two layers allowed spectroelectrochemical measurements to probe the electrochemical activity of the individual layers during the switching of the Prussian blue layer. We found that for producing layers of equal optical density, the thickness of the layers had to be different due to a difference in oscillator strength for the metal-to-metal charge-transfer transition. The films used here had a thickness of 300 +/- 70 nm and 30 +/- 15 nm for the FeCr and FeFe sub-layers, respectively. The colouration efficiency was found to be 147.8 +/- 0.8 cm(2) C-1 for the multilayered film. These results show that it is possible to obtain bilayers of Prussian blues that, with a unique optical spectral fingerprint of each sub-layer, retain the electrochromic functionality and therefore enable layer-sensitive studies of charge-transfer processes in thin film heterostructures of multifunctional materials.

Recent reports suggest that light-to-heat conversion can also play an important role. In this work, we study Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), which are known to have a high photothermal heating efficiency and can be used as cathodes for Li-ion batteries. PBAs were synthesized directly on a carbon collector electrode and tested under different thermally controlled conditions to show the effect of photothermal heating on battery performance. Our PBA electrodes reach temperatures that are 14% higher than reference electrodes using a blue LED, and a capacity enhancement of 38% was achieved at a current density of 1600 mA g(-1). Additionally, these batteries show excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 96.6% in dark conditions and 94.8% in light over 100 cycles. Overall, this work shows new insights into the effects leading to improved battery performance in photobatteries.

Here, through structural design with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Ce is predicted to enable the construction of coordinatively unsaturated metal centers (CUCs) in Prussian blue analogue (PBA), which can strongly adsorb H2O2 and donate sufficient electrons for directly splitting the O-O bond to produce (OH)-O-center dot. Using a substitution-co-assembly strategy, binary Ce-Fe PBA is then prepared, which rapidly degrades sulfamethoxazole with the pseudo-first-order kinetic rate constant exceeding reported values by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons reduce Fe(III) and Ce(IV) to promote the metal valence cycle in CUCs and make sulfamethoxazole degradation efficiency only lose 6.04% in 5 runs. Overall, by introducing rare earth metals into transition metal-organic frameworks, this work guides the whole process for highly active CUCs from design and construction to mechanism exploration with DFT calculations, enabling ultrafast and stable photo-Fenton catalysis.

Rational design and construction of hierarchical heterostructures are helpful for developing efficient OER electrocatalysts due to their interesting morphological features and electrochemical properties. Herein, we prepared hierarchical CoS 2 @(Fe,Ni)S 2 heterostructures on carbon fiber paper (CoS 2 @(Fe,Ni)S 2 /CFP) with particle -on -wire morphology using prussian blue analogue as template and precursor. The unique hierarchical heterostructure maximizes accessible active sites and the synergistic effect between different components significantly improves electrocatalytic activity. Impressively, CoS 2 @(Fe,Ni)S 2 /CFP electrocatalyst requires a small overpotential of 237 mV to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm -2 with a low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec - 1 and the corresponding voltage has no obvious change after 60 h stability test under a constant current density of 50 mA cm -2 in 1 M KOH solution.

This catalyst showed an outstanding activity, with an onset overpotential of 361 mV. Using pyridine as a molecular probe, we identified the presence of vacant Fe2+ sites, and the quantification of these sites allowed us to estimate a TOF number of 0.2170 s(-1) for the water oxidation reaction.

Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting is one of the biggest obstacles because of its extremely high kinetic barrier. Conventional OER catalysts are mainly noble-metal oxides represented by IrO2 and RuO2, but these compounds tend to have poor sustainability. The attention on Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs (PBA) in the field of energy conversion systems was concentrated on their open-framework structure, as well as its varied composition comprised of Earth-abundant elements. The unique electronic structure of PBA enables its promising catalytic potential, and it can also be converted into many other talented compounds or structures as a precursor. This undoubtedly provides a new approach for the design of green OER catalysts. This article reviews the recent progress of the application of PBA and its derivatives in OER based on in-depth studies of characterization techniques. The structural design, synthetic strategy, and enhanced electrochemical properties are summarized to provide an outlook for its application in the field of OER. Moreover, due to the similarity of the reaction process of photo-driven electrolysis of water and the former one, the application of PBA in photoelectrolysis is also discussed.

However, Fe-PBAs suffer poor cycle stability and low specific capacity due to the low crystallinity and irreversible phase transition during excess sodium-ion storage. Herein, a modified co-precipitation method to prepare highly crystallized PBAs is reported. By introducing an electrochemical inert element (Zn) to substitute the high-spin Fe in the Fe-PBAs (ZnFeHCF-2), the depth of charge/discharge is rationally controlled to form a highly reversible phase transition process for sustainable sodium-ion storage. Minor lattice distortion and highly reversible phase transition process of ZnFeHCF-2 during the sodium-ions insertion and extraction are proved by in-situ tests, which have significantly impacted the cycling stability. The ZnFeHCF-2 shows a remarkably enhanced cycling performance with capacity retention of 58.5% over 2000 cycles at 150 mA g(-1) as well as superior rate performance up to 6000 mA g(-1) (fast kinetics).

Herein, a nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction is facilely synthesized through directly pyrolyzing the mixture of Prussian blue analogues, graphene oxide and graphitic carbon nitride in the presence of silica colloids. Post-synthesis removal of silica hard templates leads to a cobalt and nitrogen co-doped reduced graphene oxide composite with Co nanoparticles, which comprises abundant mesoporous textures and a high specific surface area of 703.26 cm(2) g(-1). The resultant composite shows marked oxygen reduction reaction activity, with a more positive half-wave potential of +0.848 V, a higher limiting current, a stronger immunity to fuel crossover effect and higher operation stability, as compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution. Besides, such composite can also serve as efficient and stable hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst in alkaline electrolyte, and an over potential of only 180 mV is required to reach 10 mA cm(-2). The remarkable bifunctional catalytic activities are attributed to the synergistic effects of Co nanoparticles and graphene substrate. These results highlight the high potential of present strategy in synthesis of multifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fast-Charging Capability of Thin-Film Prussian Blue Analogue Electrodes for Aqueous Sodium-Ion Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES												Prussian blue analogues are considered as promising candidates for aqueous sodium-ion batteries providing a decently high energy density for stationary energy storage. However, suppose the operation of such materials under high-power conditions could be facilitated. In that case, their application might involve fast-response power grid stabilization and enable short-distance urban mobility due to fast re-charging. In this work, sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate thin-film electrodes are synthesized via a facile electrochemical deposition approach to form a model system for a robust investigation. Their fast-charging capability is systematically elaborated with regard to the electroactive material thickness in comparison to a '' traditional '' composite-type electrode. It is found that quasi-equilibrium kinetics allow extremely fast (dis)charging within a few seconds for sub-micron film thicknesses. Specifically, for a thickness below approximate to 500 nm, 90% of the capacity can be retained at a rate of 60C (1 min for full (dis)charge). A transition toward mass transport control is observed when further increasing the rate, with thicker films being dominated by this mode earlier than thinner films. This can be entirely attributed to the limiting effects of solid-state diffusion of Na+ within the electrode material. By presenting a PBA model cell yielding 25 Wh kg-1 at up to 10 kW kg-1, this work highlights a possible pathway toward the guided design of hybrid battery-supercapacitor systems. Furthermore, open challenges associated with thin-film electrodes are discussed, such as the role of parasitic side reactions, as well as increasing the mass loading.

Two different oxidation peaks ascribed to species of Ag and Fe with wide peak-to-peak potential can be found on the Ag/NiFe PBA modified electrode. In the presence of chloride ions, owing to the solid-state electrochemistry of silver chloride (AgCl), a sharp characteristic peak appeared with largely enhanced current intensity. After adding GSH, sensitive decline in the peak current of AgCl can be found for the specific interaction of Ag-GSH accompany with the "crowding-out effect", while the peak current of NiFe PBA remains unchanged. Using the ratio of the peak currents (IAgCl/IFe) as the signal output, Ag/NiFe PBA modified electrode showed wide linear range of 0.5 nM-5 mu M for the quantitative of GSH with an extremely low detection limit of 0.12 nM, showing superior performance compared with previous electrochemical methods. The sensor can be utilized for the determination of GSH in various vegetable and serum samples. The ultrasensitive solid-state electrochemistry of AgCl promoted signal amplification strategy as well as the specific recognition and competitive reaction increasing the selectivity make the ratiometric sensor great potential in bioanalysis, food analysis and early diagnosis of cancer in clinics.

However, the capacity of reported PBAs has a great distance from its theoretical value. Herein, we proposed that [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies are crucial point for the high specific capacity for the first time. The [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co-precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as-prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168 mAh g(-1) at 25 mA g(-1), close to PBAs' theoretical capacity 170 mAh g(-1)), high rate performance (90 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)), and high energy density (over 500 Wh kg(-1)).					liu, jiale/HTO-3772-2023														1433-7851	1521-3773				SEP 23	2024	63	39							e202400214	10.1002/anie.202400214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.202400214		FEB 2024						38299760					WOS:001173789600001

However, the highly selective generation of 1 O 2 is limited by the development of catalysts. Herein, a two-dimensional (2D) cobalt-carbon - nitrogen loaded three-dimensional (3D) Prussian blue analogue (CoCN@PBA-P) material was synthesized by the one-step method using hematite with different morphologies as the precursor. The two atomically dispersed Co sites in three CoCN@PBA-P were demonstrated that could effectively activate PMS to degrade bisphenol A (BPA) in different and complex environmental backgrounds. The quenching, probe quantitative, and EPR results indicated the dominant role of 1 O 2 in CoCN@PBA-P/PMS system, and the steady-state concentration of 1 O 2 can achieve 4.0 x 10 -9 -1.3 x 10 -8 M. Importantly, the role of Co as the active site was verified by screening experiments, and the mechanism of CoCN@PBA-P activate PMS was revealed by experimentally and theoretically, and the pathway to generate 1 O 2 is *HSO 5 -> *SO 4 +OH - -> *SO 4 +*OH -> *O -> 1 O 2 (* represents that the species is bound to the active site). Finally, the analysis of degradation intermediates and their toxicity showed that the whole process is harmless to the environment. This work provides a new perspective to the design of 2D@3D materials and their application in PMS-based AOPs.

As electrocatalyst materials, the performance of hollow-structure materials is usually better than that of solid materials because of the larger specific surface area, lower density, and more exposed active sites of hollow structure. Bimetallic catalysts usually exhibit better catalytic activity than monometallic catalysts because of the synergistic effects between different metal elements. Prussian blue and its analogues (PB/PBAs) are ideal precursors for preparing hollow-structure bimetallic catalysts due to their structure and composition characteristics. In this study, ZIF-67 hollow sphere (HS) was used as the template to prepare hierarchical hollow CoFePBA (H-SCP) through anion-exchange method. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance of H-SCP was further improved by low-temperature heat treatment in N2 atmosphere. The H-SCP-350 sample, which was obtained at a heat-treatment temperature of 350 celcius, was a bimetallic nanocomposite. Part of H-SCP was converted into metallic cobalt and cobalt-iron alloy during heat treat-ment. The synergistic effect among the different components effectively improved the electrocatalytic activity of the material. Therefore, H-SCP-350 showed the best OER catalytic performance among all sam-ples. The overpotential was only 291mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 when tested in 1 M KOH electrolyte.

On the other hand, PBAs with threedimensional open framework can provide highly reversible insertion/removal of ions in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. What is more, PBAs possess two active redox species for redox reactions during electrochemical charge/discharge process, potentially providing high specific capacity for batteries. However, in most cases, only one transition-metal specie is activated during charge/discharge process, together with existence of vacancies and coordinated/interstitial water molecular, leading to 50% lower electrochemical utilization of PBAs framework. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview on electrochemical redox of PBAs hosting Li+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pd2+, Al3+, Y3+, H+, H3O+ and NH4+ ions for rechargeable batteries, including number of redox active species, structural evolutions, output voltage, capacity delivered and cyclic stability. We also analyze the strategies and progresses in overcoming issues associated with achieving high specific capacity, high output voltage and long cyclic lifespan of batteries based on PBAs cathodes. Finally, perspectives are provided on the design requirements for future generation of PBAs electrodes, with focus on synthetic strategies, structure design, electrolyte optimization and electrochemical principle towards large-scale electric application.

The Raman, IR, Mossbauer and XPS results reveal that MC-NiPBA composite exhibited a large modification to covalent character of carbon and an increase in defects of carbonaceous material. This latter is associated with the oxidation of carbon sites and reduction of iron in hexacyanoferrate during composite synthesis, which increase the charge subtraction in Fe (Low Spin) through CN ligand, due to sp-d hybridization between nickel and carbon structure. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization showed that the interaction between MC and NiPBA decreases the paste resistance and improves the chemical capacitance of the material, whereas, the apparent diffusion coefficient for K-ion in Ni-PBA is not affected by the presence of mesoporous carbon. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic characterization confirm the enhancement of MC-NiPBA capacitance during charge/discharge process due to their synergetic interaction. However, the donor/acceptor characteristics of nitrogen modify the orbital hybridization in doped carbon, inhibiting the carbon-framework interaction.

Nevertheless, the poor cycle performance caused by the [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4- defects and Jahn-Teller (J -T) effect hinders its practical application. Here, Zn-substituted PBAs were synthesized through co-precipitation method and studied as cathodes for Na -ion batteries. The synthesized Na 1.14 Zn 0.39 Fe 0.61 [Fe(CN) 6] & sdot; 4.14H 2 O (NZFC) and Na 1.18 Zn 0.42 Fe 0.58 [Fe(CN) 6] & sdot; 4.96H 2 O (NZFE) showed outstanding exceptional electrochemical properties, including high capacity (first capacity of 114.56 and 97.76 mAh & sdot; g - 1 at 10 mA & sdot; g - 1 , respectively), excellent rate property (71.81 and 68.69 mAh & sdot; g - 1 at 500 mA & sdot; g - 1 , respectively), and cycling stability (64.72 % and 80.27 %, respectively) after 350 cycles at 200 mA g -1 , which is attribute to introduction of Zn element induced a weak Jahn-Teller effect and a low-spins and a high-spins Fe II /Fe III redox sites coordinated by C and N atoms prompt reversible diffusion of sodium ions and without structural transformation in the Na -ion storage. Using combined experiment and theory via ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is confirmed that the weak J -T distortion contributes significantly to fastoverall kinetics, structural stability, and high electronic conductivity of the electrode. These findings provide new insights into comprehending for the future development of high -performance and stable sodium ion batteries.					xia, yongmei/C-5631-2009; Su, Jiangbin/E-4858-2013														2352-152X	2352-1538				JUN 15	2024	90		A						111924	10.1016/j.est.2024.111924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2024.111924		MAY 2024											WOS:001240599800001

Since Prussian blue analogues have the two central linking atoms of -C equivalent to N-, they have large structure flexibility and are suitable to explore new NTE materials. However, understanding the nature of structure flexibility from the point of view of chemical bonding is important and urgent. Here, we adopt for the first time first-principles calculations to predict that the cubic TiCo(CN)(6)and ScCo(CN)(6)have NTE behavior. The calculated results for M in MCo(CN)(6)(M = Fe, Ti and Co) indicated that the Sc-N bond is the strongest, but with the weakest direction dependence among the M-N bonds in the three systems. The lattice dynamics calculations results revealed that the low-frequency phonon vibration modes for NTE in MCo(CN)(6)have much stronger relationship with the M-N bond feature. The present work reveals the important role of the related bond in the NTE open-framework materials.					jia, yu/HHR-9047-2022; LI, YANQING/HKF-0151-2023; Shi, Yu-Chen/N-3937-2013; Liang, Er-Jun/D-7954-2012	Gao, qilong/0000-0002-8871-8329; Sun, Qiang/0000-0002-8299-2503													0953-8984	1361-648X				OCT 28	2020	32	45							455703	10.1088/1361-648X/aba777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/aba777								32688349					WOS:000563394600001

One of the Prussian Blue analogs, sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaxMn[Fe(CN)(6)], MnHCF), experiences significant initial capacity decrease due to Jahn-Teller distortion depending on the sodium content. In contrast, Sodium copper hexacyanoferrate (NaxCu[Fe(CN)(6)], CuHCF) exhibits lower reversible sodium-ion content compared to MnHCF and exhibits excellent cycling stability. We designed direct-strike coprecipitation process to synthesize nanocomposite of PBAs. The proposed encapsulated composite has been successfully synthesized by encapsulating MnHCF with self-assembled CuHCF, leading to substantial improvement in the cycling performance of MnHCF. The encapsulated composite demonstrated a capacity of 106.2 mAh g(-1) even at high current rate. Regarding cycle stability, it retained over 68 % of its initial capacity even after 500 cycles. The ion conductivity was calculated through the Galvanostatic intermittent titration test (GITT), and the encapsulated composite exhibited higher ion conductivity than pristine MnHCF. Ex-situ post-analysis was conducted to confirm structural evolution of samples. The severe structural collapse of MnHCF led to electrode damage, whereas the encapsulated composite demonstrated excellent electrode condition. The encapsulated composite exhibited superior performance in full-cell tests as well.

In this study, we synthesized a composite material, i. e. Fe, Mn-Prussian blue analogue@MXene, which is highly responsive to visible light and serves as an innovative activator for perox-ydisulfate (PDS) in the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH). The FeMn-PBA@MXene-0.30 composite, with its unique metal-organic framework (MOF) structure, exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the degradation of TCH by activating PDS through dual redox cycles of Mn(II)-C=N-Fe(III) and Mn(III)-C=N-Fe (II). A remarkable 93.41% removal of TCH can be achieved at a concentration of 30 mg center dot L-1 within 120 min. The presence of MXene in the composite may facilitate the efficient electron transportation owing to its excellent conductivity. The influences of various reaction conditions are also investigated, such as the concentration of potassium persulfate (KPS), TCH concentration, and solution pH value. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis and trapping experiments revealed the presence of reactive species, including O-1(2), center dot OH, and h(+), in the FeMn-PBA@MXene-0.30/visible light/PDS system. Furthermore, we demonstrated the application of the FeMn-PBA@MXene-0.30 composite as the photoanode of a solar-assisted photoelectrochemical desalination (SA-PED) device, which combines the TCH degradation with photoelectrochemical desalination. This novel approach enabled simultaneous degradation and desalination, resulting in a significant reduction of 4000-ppm brine to 240 ppm (lower than the freshwater threshold of 500 ppm), with a salt removal efficiency (SRE) of 94.00%. Meanwhile, the degradation rate of TCH (900 mg center dot L-1) reached up to 98.91% under visible light irradiation.

Herein, Prussian blue analogues (PBA)-derived CoFe-based nanomaterials with increased specific surface area and abundant catalytic active sites are utilized as efficient and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the adjustable chemical conformation and controllable 3D morphology, CoFe-B nanocubes exhibit an ultrathin nanosheets-wrapped nanocube structure with excellent electrocatalytic performance and remarkable reaction kinetics in 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution. In addition, CoFe-B nanocubes cost overpotentials of 261 and 338 mV at corresponding current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively, with small Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1) for OER, which displays higher catalytic capability than the reported commercial RuO2. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance can be mainly attributed to the unique ultrathin nanosheets-wrapped nanocube structure which is generated from calcination.

Herein, we find that the doping of a second divalent 3d metal ion (Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+) into the PB framework results in discriminated peroxidase-like activity, by catalyzing the oxidation reaction of 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with H2O2. The order of the catalyzed reaction generally follows Cu2+-doped PB (CuPB) > PB > Co2+-doped PB (CoPB) > Ni2+-doped PB (NiPB). Besides the atomic preference over Cu doping, the amount of doped Cu2+ is rationally engineered for the optimization of peroxidase-like activity. By coupling the optimized CuPB nanoparticles with natural uricase, we develop a cascade reaction system for measuring the uric acid level in human urine specimens, the results of which are well correlated with the standard values determined on instrumentation (R2 = 0.975). Due to the simplicity of the platform and capability of preparing CuPB nanozyme in a large scale, we envisage the method to be translated into urinalysis of uric acid, especially packaged as a type of assay kits for point-of-care testing.

Both iron and copper are well -proven transition metals for catalytic activities owing to their aptitude to achieve much -pronounced reactant transformations under minor circumstances, as well as their environmental friendliness, cyclability, and long-term durability at 10 mA cm -2 in 1.0 M KOH, the greenly synthesized Fe 8 Cu 2 CN (PBAs) on NF (Nickel foam) displays a low overpotential of 150 mV (118 mV dec - 1 ) for HER (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction) and 290 mV (112 mV dec - 1 ) for OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction). Fe 8 Cu 2 CN displays ultra -stable behavior (150 h) with a slight current loss of 4.2 % for OER and 3.4 % for HER, respectively. The interaction of Fe, Cu, and CN (cyanide) enhances the rate of reaction kinetics. The designing of a water electrolyzer that delivers 10 mA cm -2 at 1.60 V is made possible with the help of the improved bifunctional catalyst Fe 8 Cu 2 CN/NF. The Fe 8 Cu 2 CN/NF//Fe 8 Cu 2 CN/NF exhibits long -last durability (over 180 h) with a negligible current reduction of 5.4 %. The improved effectiveness of the synthesized catalyst is demonstrated by the solar water splitting at 1.66 V. These findings suggest that Fe 8 Cu 2 CN/NF//Fe 8 Cu 2 CN/NF can be used to produce large quantities of H 2 at very affordable prices.					mathi, selvam/ABE-9708-2020; Shetti, Nagaraj P./P-4015-2017	Shetti, Nagaraj P./0000-0002-5233-7911; madasu, Sreenivasulu/0009-0006-9935-8644													0013-4686	1873-3859				JUL 10	2024	492								144340	10.1016/j.electacta.2024.144340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2024.144340		MAY 2024											WOS:001238714900001

Herein, open and freestanding films (MXene/Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), specifically, MXene/NiHCF and MXene/CuHCF) were prepared by vacuum filtration of a mixed solution of PBAs nanoparticles and a Ti3C2Tx MXene dispersion and directly used as HCDI electrodes. The conductive MXene nanosheets bridge the PBAs nanoparticles to form a three-dimensional (3D) conductive network structure, which can accelerate the salt ion and electron diffusion/transport kinetics for HCDI. Additionally, the PBAs nanoparticles can prevent the restacking of MXene nanosheets, expand their interlayer spacing, and facilitate the rapid diffusion and storage of ions. Benefiting from the dual pseudocapacitance and synergistic effect of PBAs and MXene, the obtained MXene/PBAs films show superior properties, with a high desalination capacity (85.1 mg g(-1) for the MXene/NiHCF film and 80.4 mg g(-1) for the MXene/CuHCF film) and an ultrafast salt-removal rate, much higher than those of other Faradaic electrodes. The synergistic effect, the adsorption of Na+ ions, and the enhanced conductivity of MXene/PBAs films were demonstrated through first-principles calculations. This paper offers a simple and convenient method for the design of freestanding HCDI electrodes and promotes the rapid development of HCDI technology.

The Fe-PBAs cubic nano -particles effectively promote electrode/electrolyte contact, accelerate electron transfer and ion diffusion. The Ti3C2TX MXenes conductive networks can not only facilitate the transmission and diffusion of electrons/ions, but also provide additional Li+ ions storage sites to increase the specific capacity, thereby improving the rate per-formance and reversible capacity. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of nano cubic Fe-PBA and layered Ti3C2TX MXenes, compared with pristine Fe-PBA, the Fe-PBA-CT2 cathode with moderate content of Ti3C2TX MXenes delivers a superior discharge capacity of 145.9 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, remarkable rate performance and excellent cycling stability without capacity fading after 900 cycles at 1 C. The ex-situ X-ray diffraction test proves that the structure change of Fe-PBA-CT is highly reversible process during cycling.

However, the insufficient sodium and high contents of water in the structure greatly hinder their practical applications. Herein, an in-situ pre-sodiation strategy is conducted to realize a one-step transformation of sodium-poor Prussian blue (NP-PB) to sodium-rich Prussian blue (NR-PB) without the introduction of other impurities. The introduced sodium ions take the place of coordination water, resulting in richer sodium ion transport channels and higher structural stability. Thanks to the high sodium content and low water content in the structure, the as prepared NR-PB presents a significantly higher initial coulombic efficiency of 95.18% compared to that of NP-PB (41.93%). When coupled with hard carbon (HC), the NP-PB//HC cell exhibits an ultra-high capacity retention of 93.71% after 300 cycles at a current density of 200 mAh/g. Our work provides guidance for the in-situ transformation of sodium-poor Prussian blue into sodium-rich Prussian blue, which is of great importance for the practical applications of sodium ion batteries.					周, 敏/IWD-8464-2023; Chen, Manlin/GXV-0217-2022; Jiang, Kai/JTT-8039-2023; Wang, Wei/HHS-5286-2022; Wang, Tianqi/ABC-2166-2020														1385-8947	1873-3212				JUN 1	2024	489								151531	10.1016/j.cej.2024.151531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.151531		APR 2024											WOS:001217116500001

In this strategy, Fe/C composite was firstly synthesized by employing molten sodium chloride as a floating template that carried iron nuclei through the holes in the carbon matrix, and thereafter ensured uniform growth and distribution of iron crystals. Then this Fe/C intermediate was transformed into carbon-encapsulated Prussian blue material via its impregnation into potassium hexacyanoferrate solution. Since this strategy was not unique to the system demonstrated, it should provide general guidance as to the fabrication of carbon-encapsulated Prussian blue analogs. The carbon-encapsulated Prussian blue material was characterized by XRD, Raman, TG, DSC, XPS, XANES, SEM, TEM and HRTEM measurements. Also, it was tested as a potential anode material for potassium-ion storage both in half and full cells through galvanostatic test, rate performance test, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Second-harmonic generation experiments are carried out between 1100 and 1700 nm and within the hysteresis loop of this compound. In the low-and high-temperature phases, our measurements indicate that the effective second-order nonlinear component chi((2)) of this material is small, compared with a-quartz. However, in the high-temperature phase and close to 1100 nm, its chi((2)) is enhanced by more than one order of magnitude. Terahertz generation indicates that in this frequency range, the effective chi((2)) of this compound is high and comparable with that of ZnTe. Finally, we demonstrate that within the thermal hysteresis loop of this Prussian-blue analogue, one can modulate the chi((2)) by photoswitching it from the low-temperature to the high-temperature phase.

Herein, a high-entropy MnCoNiCuZn-Prussian blue analogue (HE-PBA) is utilized to modify the commercial polypropylene separator (PP@HE-PBA), which will form an artificial protective layer on the surface of Li. The polar -CN groups of HE-PBA can enhance the wettability of PP to the electrolyte, while the movement of PF6- anions are flexibly tuned by the appropriate absorption ability and synergistic effect of multiple metal ions in HE-PBA. A high Li+ transference number of 0.69 is achieved, which can relieve the Li+ concentration polarization, regulate the Li+ flow, and realize the uniform Li deposition. With PP@HE-PBA, the Li||Li symmetric cells display durability up to 600 h in the ester-based electrolyte at 1 mA cm-2 for 1 mAh cm- 2. Also, the PP@HE-PBA exhibits great potential in LMBs, where the Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) ||Li and sulfated polyacrylonitrile (S-PAN) ||Li batteries deliver superior cycling performance to those without PP@HEPBA.

Their chemical compositions, structures, morphologies, valences of transition metals, and electrochemical sensing performances for 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) are examined in details. It is found that all the prepared PBAs hold face-centered-cubic structures with near perfect cube morphologies for NiFe-PBA and CoFe-PBA and truncated cube morphology for MnFe-PBA. For the electrochemical detection of 2-NP, a wide detection range of 1.0-700.0 mu M was obtained at all PBAs modified electrodes together with the sensitivities of 443.3, 368.0, and 339.0 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) and detection limits of 0.28, 0.46, and 0.59 mu M achieved at NiFe-PBA, CoFe-PBA, and MnFe-PBA modified electrodes, respectively. The superiority in electrochemical sensing performance of NiFe-PBA to CoFe-PBA and MnFe-PBA may stem from its higher conductivity, lager electroactive surface area, and better intrinsic catalytic property of the transition metal in its framework. Furthermore, the constructed NiFe-PBA-based sensor displays good repeatability, long-term stability, and high selectivity together with desirable recoveries (97.8-103.9%) for the assay of 2-NP in water samples. The present work is the first report on the PBAs-based electrochemical sensors for 2-NP detection, which may promise a future of PBAs or PBAs-based materials for sensing applications.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have become a subject of significant interest for commercial applications owing to their exceptional specific capacity and broad operational potential window as cathode materials for rechargeable metal-ion batteries.

The present study describes the direct and simple synthesis of 2D nanosheets of MnFCN (Mn-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) center dot nH(2)O) on nickel foam (NF) via a successive ionic layer deposition (SILD) method, which provided more ion diffusion and electrochemical conductivity. MnFCN/NF exhibited exceptional cathode performance for RMIBs, delivering a high specific capacity of 1032 F/g at 1 A/g in an aqueous 1M NaOH electrolyte. Additionally, the specific capacitance reached the remarkable levels of 327.5 F/g at 1 A/g and 230 F/g at 0.1 A/g in 1M Na2SO4 and 1M ZnSO4 aqueous solutions, respectively.

However, originating from the rapid crystal growth, PBAs still suffer from considerable vacancy defects and interstitial water, making the preparation of long-cycle-life PBAs the greatest challenge for its practical application. Herein, a novel equilibrium chelation strategy is first proposed to synthesize a high crystallinity (94.7%) PBAs, which is realized by modulating the chelating potency of strong chelating agents via "acid effect" to achieve a moderate chelating effect, forcefully breaking through the bottleneck of poor cyclic stability for PBAs cathodes. Impressively, the as-prepared highly crystalline PBAs represent an unprecedented level of electrochemical performance including ultra-long lifespan (10000 cycles with 86.32% capacity maintenance at 6 A g-1), excellent rate capability (82.0 mAh g-1 at 6 A g-1). Meanwhile, by pairing with commercial hard carbon, the as-prepared PBAs-based SIBs exhibit high energy density (350 Wh kg-1) and excellent capacity retention (82.4% after 1500 cycles), highlighting its promising potential for large-scale energy storage applications.

Specially, bivalent cobalt is introduced into a potassium ferricyanide solution containing hydrochloric acid and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. The uniform PBAs with opened cages are formed tardily after hydrothermal reaction. Time-dependent evolution characterization on composition elucidating the RCE mechanism is based on the sequential reduction of ferric iron and cation exchange reaction between divalent iron and cobalt. The PBA structures are confirmed by electron tomography technology, and the heterogeneous element distribution is verified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental analysis, leading to the formation of core-shell PBAs with compositional heterogeneity (Fe rich shell and Co rich core) and open cage architecture. When the PBA catalysts are used to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), superior OER activity and long-term stability (low overpotential of 271 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and approximate to 5.3% potential increase for 24 h) are achieved, which is attributed to the unique compositional and structural properties as well as high special surface areas (576.2 m(2) g(-1)). The strategies offer insights for developing PBAs with compositional and structural multiplicity, which encourages more practical catalytic applications.					cheng, yan/AHE-5457-2022; Khan, Muhammad/ABD-1022-2021; Li, Jiansheng/E-8992-2011; Liu, Chao/CAF-2694-2022; Liu, Jizi/N-8063-2016; Wang, Lianjun/H-6490-2011; Yu, Chengzhong/I-8663-2012; Wang, Chaohai/P-5016-2018; Song, Hao/C-5166-2019; Liu, Chao/H-1712-2019	Yu, Chengzhong/0000-0003-3707-0785; cheng, yan/0000-0002-0067-2646; Wang, Chaohai/0000-0002-3133-1959; Zhang, Wuxiang/0000-0003-2712-4188; Song, Hao/0000-0002-6383-0605; Liu, Chao/0000-0003-0316-4994													2198-3844					APR 3	2019	6	7							1801901	10.1002/advs.201801901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.201801901								30989025					WOS:000463153100005

However, during the synthesis process, a large number of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4- vacancies are easily caused, which leads to the destruction of crystal structure and the rapid decay of discharge capacity. In this work, the effect of sodium salts on lattice defects and electrochemical properties of iron hexacyanoferrates (FeHCF) was studied by adding different sodium salts (Na 2 SO 4 , NaCl, C 6 H 5 Na 3 O 7 , and EDTA-2Na) in the room-temperature coprecipitation method. It was found that the synthesis of FeHCF by adding Na 2 SO 4 based on the chelating agent can not only increase the atomic ratio of Na + but also effectively reduce [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4- vacancy defects and significantly increase the capacity contribution of low-spin Fe redox reaction. Due to the reduction of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4- vacancy defects, the crystal structure is not easy to be destroyed during the cycle process, and the cycle stability of FeHCF is significantly improved. The sample shows good electrochemical performance, with a discharge capacity of 130.8 mAh g -1 in the first cycle and 114.3 mAh g -1 after 100 cycles. This work provides a new way to synthesize PBAs with low [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4- vacancy defects.

Based on the magnetic attenuation supported by Ni on the PBA, the calculated impedance and reflection loss (RL) imply the tunable microwave absorbing properties and bandwidth in the C-Ku band. Using the suitable nanocube/RGO ratio, the minimum RL of the nanocomposites can achieve -43.5 dB at 2.2 GHz of the S band with an absorber thickness of 9.7 mm, while the widest effective absorption bandwidth (RL < -10 dB) arrived 5.0 GHz in the Ku band with a much thinner thickness of 1.9 mm. This work provides a simple design for the lightweight tunable MOF-based microwave absorbers.

The pressure response of Jahn-Teller-distorted Prussian blue analogues	CHEMICAL SCIENCE												Jahn-Teller (JT) distorted CuII-containing compounds often display interesting structural and functional behaviour upon compression. We use high-pressure X-ray and neutron diffraction to investigate four JT-distorted Prussian blue analogues: Cu[Co(CN)6]0.67, CuPt(CN)6, and ACuCo(CN)6 (A = Rb, Cs), where the first two were studied in both their hydrated and dehydrated forms. All compounds are less compressible than the JT-inactive MnII-based counterparts, indicating a coupling between the electronic and mechanical properties. The effect is particularly strong for Cu[Co(CN)6]0.67, where the local JT distortions are uncorrelated (so-called orbital disorder). This sample amorphises at 0.5 GPa when dehydrated. CuPt(CN)6 behaves similarly to the MnII-analogues, with phase transitions at around 1 GPa and low sensitivity to water. For ACuCo(CN)6, the JT distortions reduce the propensity for phase transitions, although RbCuCo(CN)6 transitions to a new phase (P2/m) around 3 GPa. Our results have a bearing on both the topical Prussian blue analogues and the wider field of flexible frameworks. Jahn-Teller (JT) distorted CuII-containing compounds often display interesting structural and functional behaviour upon compression.

However, the phase transition behavior and [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) anionic defects severely deteriorate electrochemical performances. Herein, we propose a defect-free potassium iron manganese hexacyanoferrate (K1.47Fe0.5Mn0.5[Fe(CN)(6)]<middle dot>1.26H(2)O, KFMHCF-1/2) as the cathode material for PIBs. The Fe-Mn binary synergistic and defect-free effects can inhibit the cell volume change and octahedral slip during the K-ion insertion/extraction process, so that the phase transformation behavior (monoclinic <-> cubic) is effectively inhibited, achieving a zero-strain solid solution mechanism employing Fe and Mn as dual active-sites. Thus, KFMHCF-1/2 contributes the highest initial capacity of 155.3 mAh<middle dot>g(-1) with an energy density of 599.5 Wh<middle dot>kg(-1) at 10 mA<middle dot>g(-1) among the reported PBA cathodes, superior rate capability, and cyclic stability over 450 cycles. The assembled K-ion full battery using K deposited on graphite (K@G) as anode also delivers high reversible specific capacity of 131.1 mAh<middle dot>g(-1) at 20 mA<middle dot>g(-1) and ultralong lifespans over 1000 cycles at 50 mA<middle dot>g(-1) with the lowest capacity decay rate of 0.044% per cycle. This work will promote the rapid application of high-energy-density PIBs.

Herein, well-defined bimetallic CoFe alloyed nanocrystals wrapped in nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon nanocubes (CoFe@N-GCNCs-700) are synthesized by pyrolysis of CoFe-based Prussian blue analogue nanocubes@phenolic resin. The resulting CoFe@N-GCNCs-700, as an advanced trifunctional catalyst, exhibits prominent electrocatalytic behaviors for ORR (0.802 V of half-wave potential), OER (273 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm-2) and HER (91.5 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm-2) in the alkaline solution. Furthermore, its practicability is further exploited by overall water splitting. The output voltage of only 1.63 V is demanded to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Besides, the CoFe@N-GCNCs-700 based rechargeable Zn-air batteries exhibit large peak power density (132.5 mW cm-2) and superior cycling stability (100 h without evident degeneration).

Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six M-II-Co-III Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO4 for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO4. Six M-II-Co-III PBAs@BiVO4 photocatalysts all demonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to that of BiVO4 alone. Among them, the Co-Co PBA@BiVO4 photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized by electrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopic analyses. Notably, BiVO4 coupling with Co-Co PBA cocatalyst could capture more photons than that of pure BiVO4, facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between BiVO4 and Co-Co PBA as well as the surface catalytic efficiency of BiVO4. Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategy development for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for water oxidation.

In this work, Prussian blue-reduced graphene oxide modified glass carbon electrodes were successfully fabricated using electrochemical deposition. The high surface area of graphene oxide enhanced the deposition of Prussian blue and the resulting electrocatalytic activity. Infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that the relatively porous Prussian blue was on the surface of reduced graphene oxide. Cyclic voltammetry showed that Prussian blue-coated reduced graphene oxide composite films improved electron transfer compared to Prussian blue films. The Prussian blue-reduced graphene oxide composite film provided higher response for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation of dopamine compared with the Prussian blue film due to synergistic effects between the reduced graphene oxide and Prussian blue particles. The sensitivity of the electrode was 0.1617 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2). The linear dynamic range extended from 0.5 mu M to 0.7mM dopamine with a limit of detection equal to 125nM. This work provided a versatile strategy for the design and construction of sensitive amperometric sensors with robust electrocatalytic behavior.

These two catalysts showed exceptionally high efficiencies for the degradation of Rhodamine B. The efficient redox cycling of iron species in the Fe-Co PBAs photo-Fenton process was deeply explored by Mossbauer spectroscopy. The excellent photo-Fenton activities of these Fe-Co PBAs were ascribed to the existence of highly dispersed water coordinated iron sites and abundant vacancies in the metal-organic-frameworks. Singlet oxygen was identified by radical scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which plays a key role in the photo-Fenton process. Based on these comprehensive experimental results, a novel radical reaction mechanism was proposed. This work not only opens up a new avenue for the application of Fe-Co PBAs, but also gives a deeper insight into the mechanisms of heterogeneous Fenton reactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Any discrepancy of INH in the blood may be life-threatening and causes neurotoxicity and other health issues. In this work, we present a colorimetric technique for the easy quantification of the INH in human urine. We have synthesized CuFe Prussian blue analogue nanocube (CuFe-PBA-NC) using a simple precipitation method. The synthesized nanocube has been successfully characterized by Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The synthesized CuFePBA-NC act as an excellent oxidase mimic, having a very high affinity for TMB (3,3',5,5' -tetramethylbenzidine) furnishing a blue color compound with a characteristic absorbance peak at lambda(max) = 652 nm. Further, we have exploited the oxidase property of CuFe-PBA-NC for the colorimetric detection of the INH in human urine. The developed sensor shows very high sensitivity in the range of 1 to 100 mu M with a detection limit of 0.44 mu M. Furthermore, a portable kit was developed for the onsite detection of the INH concentrations in the test samples. The method is easy and cost-effective with sensitive detection of INH.

This work focuses on regulating the morphology and composition of the PBA at the front-end to optimize the OER performance of the derived TMP. By temperature control surfactant desorption ability, we obtain a series of ternary FeCoNi (FCN-PBAs). With the increase of temperature, their morphologies change from truncated octahedrons to cubic octahedrons and truncated cubes, in which the Fe content basically remains unchanged and the Co/Ni ratio gradually decreased. Due to the synergistic effect among ternary TMPs, all phosphidation products (FCN-P) exhibit better OER activities than RuO2, among which FCN-40-P shows the best performance. As confirmed by XPS analyses, the appropriate chemical composition enhances the oxidizabilityof TM species, promotes the chemical adsorption of OH-, and accelerates OER kinetics.

The adhesion of PB on the electrode and the EA and ED of Cs+ were substantially higher when the CNF electrode was used, compared with the fluorine-doped tin oxide supporting electrode. The use of CNF led to the smooth occurrence of EA and ED of Cs+, where the reported efficiency was: NiFe > FeFe > cPB. The EA and ED of Cs+ on NiFe decorated CNF (C-NiFe) were strongly affected by the loading amount of NiFe. Although the strongest EA capacity was identified when 1 mg of NiFe was used, it decreased as the loading amount of NiFe increased. Thus, the EA of Cs+ occurs under the reduction of NiFe with some Fe(III) reduced to Fe(II) of NiFe, thus inducing more adsorption of Cs+. Overall, we confirmed that the C-NiFe electrode with appropriate thickness of NiFe layer is potentially an excellent adsorbent for Cs removal.

The electrochromic mechanism of MoOHCF is similar to that of PB, involving alkali metal ions which intercalate into the lattice structure at different applied potentials to bring a vivid color change. MoOHCF presents a brownish red color at its reduced state (0.51 V) and becomes yellowish at the oxidized state (1.17 V). Our electrodeposited MoOHCF thin film exhibits wide transmittance change (Delta T=ca. 48%) at 480 nm, a fast response time (2.1 s) and high cycling stability that exceeds 300 cycles. In addition, it can be assembled into an electrochromic window capable of a broad-band (300-900 nm) transmittance modulation with PB. In this study, a PB/MoOHCF electrochromic device (PMECD) with the NaClO4/propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte is fabricated. The device changes its color between deep green and yellowish (almost transparent). By controlling the potential between -0.5 V and +1.0 V (PB vs. MoOHCF), the PMECD shows the capacity of modulating average 40% optical transmittance for whole visible wavelengths. This suggests that MoOHCF is an ideal counter electrode for PB on assembling a promising energy-saving smart window. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The addition of Ag or Ni NPs was also found to enhance the CF for the 80 nm Na0.46Co[Fe(CN)6]-based Li-ion batteries but the effect was smaller.

The experimental results showed that the iron-based PBAs transferred from the cubic structure to the monoclinic phase as the temperature increased from 5 degrees C to 60 degrees C, with the former exhibiting rich-in-boundary morphology and the latter showing a well-defined cubic shape. The electrochemical performance of the samples is closely related to the structure: the PBAs with monoclinic structures exhibit a higher charge/discharge specific capacity than those of PBAs with cubic structures. In addition, the samples are further treated at 270 degrees C, new phases are probed, and the charge/discharge specific capacity for the HT-PB-60 sample is significantly improved by more than 36.15%.

Among different sodium-ion cell chem-istries, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) have advantages of excellent electrochemical stability, low cost, and high -rate capability, thanks to their open-framework lattice suitable for sodium-ion intercalation. The present study assesses the first commercial Prussian blue-based sodium-ion pluggable battery module developed and refined in a joint design effort between Natron Energy and ABB, offering insights into the competitiveness and maturity of sodium-ion technologies. Both single cells and battery modules (32 cells in series) are evaluated and compared with other commercial batteries. Natron's sodium-ion battery cells possess performance characteristics between lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors in terms of power capability, energy density, and cycle life. In addition, the Natron sodium-ion battery technology shows excellent safety and sustainability features that are not dependent on rare earth elements, critical mining processes, or questionable supply chain implications.

However, the short charge-transfer path limits its photocatalytic performance. Establishing a heterojunction and incorporating a co-catalyst are feasible methods to improve the photocatalytic ability of BVO by enhancing carrier transfer rates and reducing in-electrode resistances. In this study, nickel tellurium oxide (NTO) and cobalt iron Prussian blue analogues (CoFePBA) are incorporated into the BVO electrode to respectively develop a heterojunction and decorate co-catalyst for efficiently catalyzing the water oxidation reaction for the first time. Different amounts of CoFePBA are deposited on the NTO/BVO electrode by varying the electrodeposition durations to enhance exited charge generations and maintain high absorbance of incident light. The largest photocurrent density of 6.55 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is attained for the optimal CoFePBA/NTO/BVO electrode prepared using an electrodeposition duration of 2 min. Excellent catalytic stability is also achieved, with the photocurrent retention of 91.9% after illuminating the electrode for 5000 s. This study provides blueprints for incorporating novel electrochemically active materials in the BVO system to realize heterojunction and co-catalyst strategies, thereby attaining excellent photocatalytic ability toward water oxidation.

In this work, BQ was encapsulated in the size-matched pores of metalorganic frameworks (MOF) Cobalt/Iron-based Prussian blue analogues (Co/Fe-based PBA) by a coprecipitation method to construct a series of Co/Fe-based PBA@xBQ composite materials. The composite materials added with BQ exhibit significantly improved stability, demonstrating excellent electrochemical performances in lithium batteries. The close contact of BQ with Co/Fe catalytic sites promoted the rapid transfer of lithium ions between the metal sites. The unique structure of black phosphorus allowed storing more lithium ions in the pores of Co/ Fe-based PBA. Grafting the surface of MOF with BQ could reduce side reactions on the electrode surface, and their synergistic effects enhanced the lithium storage capacity. The energy density of Li||Co-Co PBA@ 8BQ and Li||Fe-Co PBA@ 10BQ batteries was 130.5 mAh & sdot;g- 1 and 187.4 mAh & sdot;g- 1 higher than the Li||Co/Fe-based PBA. Li||Fe-Co PBA@ 10BQ battery had a long cycle stability, with 70% capacity retention rate after 500 cycles.

J	Lin, KYA; Chen, BJ				Lin, Kun-Yi Andrew; Chen, Bo-Jau			Magnetic carbon-supported cobalt derived from a Prussian blue analogue as a heterogeneous catalyst to activate peroxymonosulfate for efficient degradation of caffeine in water	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												Extensive usage of caffeine (CAF) as a medicine and additives in beverages has led to increasing presence of CAF in wastewater and even drinking water. To remove CAF, peroxymonosulfate (PMS), is adopted to generate sulfate radical to degrade CAF in water. To facilitate PMS activation, a magnetic carbon supported cobalt (MC/Co) hybrid material is prepared via carbonization of a cobalt-containing Prussian blue analogue framework (Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)). The resultant MC/Co contains Co and Co3O4 nanoparticles supported on a carbon matrix, making it an attractive magnetic catalyst to activate PMS for degrading CAF. MC/Co-activated PMS was shown to degrade CAF much more effectively than PMS and Co3O4-activated PMS. Parameters affecting CAF degradation by MC/Co-activated PMS were also examined, including MC/Co and PMS concentrations, temperature, pH, and salt. Effects of radical quenchers were also examined to provide insights into the CAF degradation mechanism. MC/Co-activated PMS was much more favorable at higher temperatures than ambient temperature, and under neutral conditions. Nevertheless, the presence of concentrated NaCl noticeably hindered CAF degradation. Through examining effects of radical quenchers, the mechanism of CAF degradation by MC/Co-activated PMS was attributed primarily to sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals to a lesser extent. The degradation products of CAF by MC/Co-activated PMS were also identified and a possible degradation pathway is proposed. MC/Co can activate PMS over multiple cycles without loss of catalytic activity. These findings demonstrate that MC/Co, simply prepared from simple carbonization of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) can be a promising heterogeneous catalyst for activating PMS to degrade CAF.

Reducing production costs and simplifying the preparation method for core-shell PBAs have also become crucial considerations. This paper presents a novel approach for the first time: by acid-treating the as-synthesized solution from a simple coprecipitation reaction, a high-crystallinity, sodium-rich Mn2+-doped iron hexacyanoferrate (Fe/MnHCF) shell material is self-grown on the surface of manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF). This method significantly improves the electrochemical properties of the MnHCF material. The core-shell structured PBA exhibits excellent cycling performance (with a capacity retention of 95.5% for 400 cycles at 1 A/g) and high rate performance (134.2mAh/g@10 mA/g, 95.2mAh/g@1 A/g). In this article, we explore the growth mechanism of the high-sodium content, high-crystallinity shell structure and introduce a green chelating agent that is better suited for the crystallization of Mn and Fe-type PBA systems. Our study demonstrates that Mn2+ doping enhances the conductivity of the shell material. Meanwhile, the heterojunction structure of MnHCF@Fe/MnHCF conducive to charge separation and migration. This straightforward synthesis strategy offers a novel approach for fabricating high-performance core-shell structured Prussian Blue Analogue materials.																			0021-9797	1095-7103				JAN 15	2025	678		C				346	358		10.1016/j.jcis.2024.09.070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.09.070		SEP 2024						39298987					WOS:001318290200001

This paper presents a one-pot self-templated epitaxial growth, phase transition and self-dissolution strategy for constructing hollow nanoboxes/solid nanocubes of CoFe bimetallic Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The CoFe mixed phosphide with a porous hollow nanoboxes structure obtained after subsequent phosphating heat treatment exhibite enhanced OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media, exhibiting a low overpotential of 230 mV and a Tafel slope of 35.5 dec(-1)- 1 at 10 mA cm(-2) , as well as excellent stability for 48 h. The excellent OER activity of CoP-FeP nanoboxes (CoP-FeP NBs) can be attributed to the combination effect between their composition and structure. Structurally, the exquisite porous hollow nanoboxes structure greatly expands the surface area, reduces ion diffusion pathways, and reduces charge transfer resistance. Compositionally, the inner transition metal phosphide exhibits good conductivity and undergoes surface reconstruction during OER, forming high valence Co(Fe)OOH active substances in situ. The strong interface coupling effect of CoOOH/ FeOOH optimizes the electronic structure. This work presents a facile and efficient strategy for the construction of PBAs hollow structural materials and the exploitation of low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts.

Comparatively, P-CuFe2O4/CuO (synthesized with PVP) and graphene oxide (GO) are hydrothermal processed to obtain P-CuFe2O4/CuO/reduced-GO. The PBAs precursors present as small spherical particles with PVP (P-CuPB), irregular polygon blocks with SDBS (S-CuPB) and CTAB (C-CuPB). Porous CuFe2O4/CuO with different size are obtained after calcining the PBAs and employed as anode of lithium ion batteries. The P-CuFe2O4/CuO exhibits an excellent capacity of 630.5 mAh g(-1) with coulombic efficiency (CE) above 97%, which are better than the other two samples, and P-CuFe2O4/CuO/R-GO shows further improved reversible and stable capacity of 720 mAh g(-1) with CE above 99% cycled at 500 mA g(-1) even after 300 times. The results imply that surfactants can influence the particle structure and lithium storage performance. Besides, R-GO can effectively increase lithium ions insertion/de-insertion kinetics by supplying the matrix and buffer cushion for metal oxide volume changing during cycling. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the unavoidable disruption of the structure and the dissolution of the surface layer of the material during sodium ion de-embedding affects its stability. In this work, using a simple method, we synthesize a composite material with uniformly grown Copper Ferricyanide particles on the surface of ferric ferricyanide.

It can maintain over 92 % capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C. It also has excellent rate performance with a specific capacity of 103.4mAg-1 at 20 C.

In this study, a novel inorganic integrated membrane electrodes (i-IMEs) were developed with Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), cation insertion materials, as a coating on activated carbon (AC) electrode to replace cation exchange membrane. When the i-IMEs were operated in a rocking -chair CDI (RCDI) system for continuous desalination, a high specific adsorption capacity (SAC) of 42.7 mg/g and an impressive charge efficiency of 71.6 % were obtained. Moreover, taking advantage of PBAs' ion -selective properties for monovalent cations especially NH4+, this IME-RCDI achieved highly selective removal of cations compared to a RCDI with bare AC electrodes. The selectivity coefficients (Si/j) of NH4+ to divalent cations (such as Ca2+) and monovalent cations (such as Na+) were determined to be 2.15 and 1.95, respectively. These values are much higher than those obtained for AC electrodes, which were 0.3 and 1.07, respectively. Overall, this work demonstrates that the incorporation of PBAs in the i-IME-RCDI configuration offers superior desalination performance and selective removal capabilities for specific ions such as NH4+.

By integrating dual-phase metal sulfides and a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix, this hollow nanocubic structure provides rich catalytic centers, enhanced conductivity, large surface area, and 3D-porous channels, which all contribute to the adsorption and catalysis of dopamine. The CoS2-FeS2/HNCC-modified glassy carbon elec-trode demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity for dopamine. Under the optimal parameters, the electrochemical sensor exhibits a wide detection range (0.05-90 mu M), a low limit of detection (9.3 nM, S/N = 3), and a high sensitivity (91.6 mu A mu M-1 cm-2) along with excellent selectivity, reproducibility, reusability, and stability.

To begin with, in order to increase the reaction rate, the oxygen should be able to reach the active sites of the catalyst readily (mass transfer). Next, a moderate (i.e., not too strong or weak) interaction (kinetics) should be maintained between the oxygen molecules and the catalyst, in order to allow for better adsorption and desorption. Therefore, these two factors should be taken into consideration when designing electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction. Further, there is bound to be a demand for large-scale metal-air batteries in the future. With these goals in mind, in this study, a facile and scalable method is developed for fabricating metal-air batteries based on the fact that the Prussian blue analogue Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O and gelatin-coated Ketjenblack carbon thermally decompose at 400 degrees C in air (i.e., without requiring high-temperature pyrolysis under inert conditions) to form porous spinel oxides and N-doped carbon materials.

In this work, a controllable Prussian-blue-analogue-sacrificed strategy followed by an annealing process to harvest defect-rich Ni-Fe-doped K0.23MnO2 cubic nanoflowers (Ni-Fe-K0.23MnO2 CNFs-300) as highly active bifunctional catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) is reported. Benefiting from many merits, including unique morphology, abundant defects, and doping effect, Ni-Fe-K0.23MnO2 CNFs-300 shows the best electrocatalytic performances among currently reported Mn oxide-based electrocatalysts. This catalyst affords low overpotentials of 270 (320) mV at 10 (100) mA cm(-2) for OER with a small Tafel slope of 42.3 mV dec(-1), while requiring overpotentials of 116 and 243 mV to attain 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) for HER respectively. Moreover, Ni-Fe-K0.23MnO2 CNFs-300 applied to overall water splitting exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability, even superior to the Pt/C||IrO2 cell at large current density.

However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high-valence metal sites, particularly in high-current-density water-splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co-O-Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt-iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe-PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co-O-Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double-exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high-valence Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low-valence state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe-PBA-30) requires an overpotential of only 276 mV to achieve 1000 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe-PBA-30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1 A cm-2 at 1.76 V and continuously operates for 250 hours with negligible degradation.

In this work, the core-shell nanostructured nanocubes composed of nickel hexacyanocobalt PBA (NiCo-PBA)@cobalt carbonate hydroxide (CCH) are synthesized through an in-situ epitaxial growth strategy, and the formation mechanisms of coating are carefully validated and specifically discussed. Then, the precursors are successfully transformed into hierarchical CoNi2S4/Co9S8@Co4S3 via the gas-phase vulcanization method. Benefiting from the intriguing heterostructure and multicomponent sulfides, the CoNi2S4/Co9S8@Co4S3-80 electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 799 +/- 16C/g (specific capacitance of 1595 +/- 31F/g) at 1 A/g, ultra-high capacity retention of 80 % at a high current density of 20 A/g. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device delivers a high energy density of 43.3 Wh kg 1 at a power density of 899 W kg(-1) and exhibits superior cycling stability with the capacity retention of 88 % after 5,000 cycles. Subsequently, the fabricated all-solid-state ASC device shows an excellent energy density of 36.4 Wh kg(-1) with a power density of 824 W kg(-1).

Based on the Prussian blue nanomase's strong ability to clear free radicals, the treatment of spinal cord injury with nano-zirconium (Pb-Zr) was carried out. The disease treatment strategy based on nanomaterials has excellent therapeutic effect, and Prussian blue analogs have good therapeutic properties, so the application prospects of Prussian blue analogs is broad. From the point of view of Prussian blue content, improving the presence of zirconium in the microenvironment significantly increased the activity of Prussian blue. Prussian Blue zirconium significantly improved lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN-gamma) induced neuronal cell (pc12 cells) and macrophage dysfunction by improving oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the microenvironment. It can promote the recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury. In vivo experiments, it shows that Prussian blue zirconium can improve inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress of spinal cord tissue, promote regenerative therapy after spinal cord injury, and improve motor function. Moreover, it has been reported that high-priced Zr4+ cations can regulate the deposition and nucleation behavior of Zn2+ in high-performance zinc metal anodes. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that Pb-Zr modulates Zn2+ be used to promote recovery from spinal cord injury. The results show that nanomaterial is beneficial in the treatment of spinal cord injury. This study provides a good prospect for the application of spinal cord injury treatment. It also provides an important feasibility for subsequent clinical conversions.

The quest for novel electrode materials is driven by the need to enhance desalination capacity, cycling stability, ion selectivity, and energy efficiency, given that traditional carbon materials relying on electric double layer electrosorption principle often exhibit subpar desalination capabilities. Among the standout options, Prussian blue (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3) 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3 ) and its analogs (PB/ PBAs) have stood out in CDI systems due to their superior performance and durability as coordination polymers. Nevertheless, challenges persist in leveraging their full potential for CDI, stemming from issues like low desalination capacity, slow kinetics, poor conductivity, structural vulnerability, and limited electrochemical activity. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of innovative strategies aimed at addressing these obstacles, particularly through advancements in structural and compositional manipulation. This review seeks to consolidate the latest advancements in the nanoarchitectonics of PB/PBAs, exploring their classification, and synthesis methodologies, and delving into the fundamental principles governing their utility in CDI applications-anchored in considerations of thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanisms. Notably, the review underscores the prevailing challenges faced by PB/PBAs in CDI deployment, prompting the discussion of proactive approaches to guide future material innovation and usage.

Developing high-performance adsorbents with high removal efficiency and selectivity for ammonia nitrogen is pivotal to ecological equilibrium. Here, the removal of ammonia nitrogen by a combined process of Cobased Prussian blue (NaCo-PBA) and coagulants was studied for the first time. The maximum adsorptive capacity of ammonia nitrogen by NaCo-PBA was 52.72 mg/g, and the removal reached 99 %. Compared with traditional adsorbents, NaCo-PBA showed high adsorption amounts (9-42 times). Most importantly, NaCo-PBA exhibited selectivity in complex systems and its adsorption quantity reached 42.6 mg/g in real domestic wastewater, compared to 4.7 mg/g for commercial adsorbent. NaCo-PBA was used in the coagulation and co-adsorption process to facilitate the separation of multiple contaminants in water. It is reasonable to believe that the collaboration between NaCo-PBA with special structure and coagulation will bring a new perspective to nitrogen removal in complex systems.

K-Ion Slides in Prussian Blue Analogues	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												We study the phenomenology of cooperative off-centering of K+ ions in potassiated Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The principal distortion mechanism by which this off-centering occurs is termed a "K-ion slide", and its origin is shown to lie in the interaction between local electrostatic dipoles that couple through a combination of electrostatics and elastic strain. Using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction measurements, we determine the crystal structures of a range of low-vacancy K2M[Fe(CN)(6)] PBAs (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cd) and establish an empirical link between composition, temperature, and slide-distortion magnitude. Our results reflect the common underlying physics responsible for K-ion slides and their evolution with temperature and composition. Monte Carlo simulations driven by a simple model of dipolar interactions and strain coupling reproduce the general features of the experimental phase behavior. We discuss the implications of our study for optimizing the performance of PBA K-ion battery cathode materials and also its relevance to distortions in other, conceptually related, hybrid perovskites.

However, low conductivity and stability restrict its application. In this work, a redox-active intercalation cation electrode based on 3D network Ni-doping Cu-Prussian blue analogue NixCu1-x[Fe(CN)(6)](1-gamma) (NCP-2, gamma < 1) interwoven with CNTs (NCP/CNT) is synthesized. Experiments illustrate that the dual strategy of Ni doping and the insert of CNTs reduce the vacancy and crystal water in the lattice, resulting in a maximum capacity of 373.6 F.g(-1) and better cycling stability. NCP/CNT parallel to active carbon (AC) cell delivers a high adsorption capacity of 41.25 mg.g(-1) with less energy consumption of 0.1080 kWh.kg(-1) in 500 ppm NaCl solution. The outstanding salt adsorption depends on the rapid Fe3+/Fe2+ and Cu2+/Cu+ redox cycle, shortened Na+ diffusion path and fast electron transport. The effect of Ni doping was explored by DFT calculations, which proved it enhanced the electron density of Fe atom, stabilized the skeleton structure, increased the conductivity of PBA materials and facilitated the insertion of Na+. After CNT inserting, abundant electronic conductive channels formed among PBA nanoparticles. Hence, this work provides a feasible strategy to construct highly efficient electrodes with less energy consumption for CDI applications.

Noticeably, PBAs are also deemed extremely attractive as anode materials for batteries by virtue of their abundant internal active sites. However, their unclear redox mechanisms at lower potential severely restricts PBAs anodes to realize stable cycling performances. In this work, low-cost KxMn[Fe(CN)(6)](y)square(1-y).nH(2)O with diverse H2O content and structure are harvested via controlling the crystallization rate. It is firstly discovered that the KxMn[Fe(CN)(6)](y) anodes undergoes multi-electron conversion reactions involving the fracture and recombination of Mn-N bonds, while the stronger Fe-C bond is preserved. Then, it is confirmed that weaker Mn-N bond which need to be prepared at a faster crystallization rate is more conducive to the fast electrochemical kinetics of the reversible conversion paths. Accordingly, the K0.09Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.66)square(0.34)center dot 3.40 H2O with higher H2O content and weaker Mn-N bond achieve the best Li-storage performances, exhibiting a reversible capacity of 480 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 1 A g(-1) and considerable cycling stability exceeding 1000 cycles. The results also suggest that interstitial H2O could be beneficial for the better cycling stability of the KxMn[Fe(CN)(6)](y) anodes. This work can provide new insights for the rational design of novel conversion anodes with high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CoFe nanoalloy particles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CoFe@NC-NCNT-H) are synthesized by pyrolyzing a Prussian blue analogue precursor (i.e. Fe-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)) as low as 600 degrees C, and followed by HNO3 treatment. Such low temperature pyrolysis and HNO3 treatment affords the hybrid mesoporous material with a high level of nitrogen content (similar to 10%) and a relatively high specific surface area (similar to 210.5 m(2) g(-1)), capable of providing active sites and mass transport channels. In alkaline solution, CoFe@NC-NCNT-H is highly active towards OER with a low onset potential (similar to 1.35 V) and a small overpotential (similar to 380 mV) to reach 10.0 mA cm(-2), comparable to the state-of-the-art RUO2. CoFe@NC-NCNT-H is also a good ORR catalyst, and more importantly it exhibits an improved stability compared to commercial Pt/C. CoFe@NC-NCNT-H displays promise as a bifunctional catalyst with an extremely low potential difference (similar to 0.87 V between ORR at -3.0 mA cm(-2) and OER at 10.0 mA cm(-2)), superior to commercial Pt/C and RUO2. The facilely prepared CoFe@NC-NCNT-H with high bifunctional performance and stability promises great potential for ORR and OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The development of stable and high-performance cathode materials and environmentally friendly electrolytes is of interest for practical applications. Despite many efforts in pursuing batteries with high energy density and long cycle life, relatively little attention has been paid on the environmental aspects. Thus, bio-batteries that contain nontoxic materials and which are bio-degradable are an interesting alternative to conventional batteries. In the present paper, we present our first results on a highly reversible zinc/prussian blue analogue (PBA) bio-battery, where nanostructured PBA is used as a cathode material, a bio-degradable ionic liquid-water mixture as electrolyte, and zinc as anode. Both the PBA cathode and the zinc anode exhibit good compatibility with the bio-degradable electrolyte. The Zn/PBA battery shows good electrochemical performance including an open circuit voltage of 1.6 V, a specific capacity of similar to 54 mAh g(-1) (PBA), and a low self-discharge rate. The zinc anode also shows a good stability since no dendritic growth and shape change are observed after 50 charge-discharge cycles.					刘, 振/AAT-7674-2020; Endres, Frank/C-4963-2012														1432-8488	1433-0768				JUL	2017	21	7					2021	2027		10.1007/s10008-017-3589-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10008-017-3589-0													WOS:000405520700013

Based on Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with tunable compositions and morphologies, a defect-rich but also excellently stable cobalt-doped aluminum hexacyanoferrate (Co/KAlFC) was successfully synthesized for the separation of PGMs using defect engineering. Interestingly, the defects in Co/KAlFC induced an increase in active sites and vacancies, leading to a remarkable enhancement of PGM adsorption capacity compared to the undoped KAlFC. While maintaining the same excellent Pd(II) adsorption capacity, the convenient access provided by the defects led to a reduction of the Pd(II) adsorption equilibrium time to 30 min, as well as a 3-fold and 7-fold increase in the adsorption capacity for Ru(III) and Rh(III), respectively. The experimental and characterization results revealed that the adsorption mechanism of defect-rich Co/KAlFC on PGM was mainly a synergistic effect of ion-exchange and chemical complexation, and the enhanced electrostatic interaction promoted the adsorption process. The valence state of Fe shifted from divalent to trivalent during the adsorption process, which affected the strength of coordination interaction between PGMs and Fe-CN- at N-atom. Overall, this study not only demonstrated that Co/KAlFC is an excellent candidate for the removal of PGM from HLLW but also provided a new idea for the rational design and development of inorganic materials with exceptional properties and stability.

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have a stable and open framework structure, making them a very promising cathode material. However, high-performance manganese-based Prussian blue cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries still suffer from significant challenges due to several key issues, such as a high number of vacancy defects and a high crystal water content. This article investigates the effects of the Fe-Mn molar ratio, Mn ion concentration, and reaction time on the electrochemical performance of MnHCF during the coprecipitation process. When Fe:Mn = 1:2, c(Mn2+) = 0.02 mol/L, and the reaction time is 12 h, the content of interstitial water molecules in the sample is low, and the Fe(CN)(6) defects are few. At 0.1 C, the prepared electrode has a high initial discharge specific capacity (121.9 mAh g(-1)), and after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, the capacity retention rate is 65% (similar to 76.2 mAh g(-1)). Meanwhile, the sample electrode exhibits excellent reversibility. The discharge capacity can still be maintained at around 75% when the magnification is restored from 5 C to 0.1 C. The improvement in performance is mainly attributed to two aspects: On the one hand, reducing the Fe(CN)(6) defects and crystal water content is conducive to the diffusion and stable structure of N. On the other hand, reducing the reaction rate can significantly delay the crystallization of materials and optimize the nucleation process.

In this work, porous structured ternary nickel-iron-phosphide (Ni-Fe-P) nanocubes were synthesized through one-step phosphidation of a Ni-Fe-based Prussian blue analogue. The Ni-Fe-P nanocubes exhibit a rough and loose porous structure on their surface under suitable phosphating temperature, which is favorable for the mass transfer and oxygen diffusion during the electrocatalysis process. As a result, Ni-Fe-P obtained at 350 degrees C with poorer crystallinity offers more unsaturated atoms as active sites to expedite the absorption of reactants. Additionally, the introduction of nickel improved the electronic structure and then reduced the charge-transfer resistance, which would result in a faster electron transport and an enhancement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities. Benefiting from the unique porous nanocubes and the chemical composition, the Ni-Fe-P nanocubes exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities in alkaline medium, with low overpotentials of 182 and 271 mV for delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively.

Under weakly alkaline condition, CrPBzyme could catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 to O2, displaying appreciable catalase (CAT)-mimicking activity. The CAT-mimicking activity of CrPBzyme had differentiated changes after mixing with different transition metal ions, among which Cu2+ ion greatly enhanced the CAT-mimicking activity, causing the more rapid decomposition of H2O2 and dramatic increase of dissolved oxygen (DO) level. When glyphosate was added in the CrPBzyme/Cu2+ mixture, the CAT-mimicking activity of the mixture decreased owing to the strong interaction of glyphosate and Cu2+ ion, resulting in the decelerated decomposition of H2O2 and downward shift of DO level. On the basis of the CAT-mimicking activity of CrPBzyme and the activity modulation mediated by Cu2+, a novel sensor for rapid and quantitative determination of glyphosate was developed by using DO level as output signal, achieving a detection range of 1.0-16.7 & mu;mol/L and a limit of detection of 1.0 & mu;mol/L (3 & sigma;). The recoveries of glyphosate in real samples (water and soil) were 89.8%-99.2%, suggesting the practical potential of this method for detection of glyphosate.

In this work, a novel four-part electrocatalyst of mesoporous cobalt/iron phosphorus selenide nanocomposite (CoFe-Se-P) was derived from hollow CoFe Prussian blue analogues (CoFe-PBA) and combined by phosphatization and selenylation. This novel electrocatalyst displays an efficient and durable bifunctional catalysis performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In view of strong electron interaction among Co, Fe, Se, and P, this four-part electrocatalyst exhibits a lower onset potential of -5.9 mV and an overpotential of -72.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic solution for HER In alkaline solution, the onset potential and the overpotential are maintained at approximately -3 and -183.1 mV, respectively. Moreover, the proposed CoFe-Se-P catalyst possesses superior OER performance with a lower onset potential of 1.07 V and overpotential of 1.44 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution. The versatile electrocatalyst can catalyze water splitting in a two-electrode system at a potential of 1.59 V.

As the K+ migration rate and storage sites rely highly on the periodic lattice arrangement, it is rather important to guarantee the high crystallinity of PBAs. Herein, highly crystalline K2Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] (KFeHCF-E) is synthesized by coprecipitation, adopting the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium salt as a chelating agent. As a result, an excellent rate capability and ultra-long lifespan (5000 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) with 61.3% capacity maintenance) are achieved when tested in KIBs. The highest K+ migration rate of 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1) in the bulk phase is determined by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. Remarkably, the robust lattice structure and reversible solid-phase K+ storage mechanism of KFeHCF-E are proved by in situ XRD. This work offers a simple crystallinity optimization method for developing high-performance PBAs cathode materials in advanced KIBs.

Hereon, we report the morphology-controllable Co3S4/MoS2 co-doped nanocubes (Co3S4/MoS2 NCs) derived from cobaltic Prussian-blue analog (Co PBA). The synthetic process of these nanocubes could be controlled by the reactant ratios (1/1, 1/2 and 1/3) of Co PBA to (NH4)(2)MoS4. In this process, (NH4)(2)MoS4 acted as a multifunctional vulcanizator, which could conveniently afford Mo and S elements at the same time. As the increment of (NH4)(2)MoS4, the exterior texture of Co3S4/MoS2 NCs became rougher with more embedded tiny nanoparticles. When the ratio was set as 1/2, the as-obtained Co3S4/MoS2-2 nanocubes exhibited good catalytic property in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Notably, the DSSC with Co3S4/MoS2-2 counter electrode (CE) showed a better efficiency of 8.96% than that of Pt CE (7.77%) under standard conditions.

The first-row transition-metal-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity have been developed to replace the noble-metal catalysts, e.g., RuO2 and IrO2. In the work reported in this paper, we developed the Ni-Fe Prussian-blue analog (PBA) on the Ni foam surface (PBA/NF) via an in situ electrodeposition method and transferred the PBA/NF into bimetallic phosphides (NiFePx/NF) through the phosphidation process as highly active OER electrocatalysts in alkaline medium. The in situ electrodeposition method could not only precisely control the nucleation and growth processes of PBA on the surface of nickel foam, as well as the purity, structures, and morphologies of the deposits obtained, but also provide sufficient adhesive force between catalysts and Ni foam substrates without further use of poorly conductive binder material, which guaranteed robust electrode stability. When applying for OER, NiFePx/NF presented excellent catalytic activity. Upon screening a wide electrodeposition time range, results demonstrate that NiFePx-80/NF (deposition time 80 min) possessed the best OER catalytic activity with only 224 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as well as a Tafel slope of 29 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, which shows that the use of electrodeposition methods to directly grow PBA nanomaterials on conductive substrates may be an effective method for the preparation of multifunctional electrocatalysts.

Fabrication and photoactivity of organic-inorganic systems based on titania nanotubes and PEDOT containing redox centres formed by different Prussian Blue analogues	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												Herein, the heterojunction composed of an inorganic substrate: ordered hydrogenated titania nanotubes (H-TiO2NTs) and a deposited organic film: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is reported. The conducting polymer is modified with different transition metal haxacyanoferrates (Mehcf), wherein as metal: copper, iron, cobalt and nickel are introduced. The presence of various metal centres provides characteristic redox activity and allows to investigate the impact of the particular Prussian Blue analogues onto the photoactivity of the p-n heterojunction. The formed composites were inspected by means of scanning electron microscopy, spectroscopic techniques, i.e. UVeVis, Raman and Secondary Ion Mass spectrometry and using electrochemical methods. It is shown that electrochemical and photoelectrochemical performance of the so-fabricated materials is significantly affected by the nature of the redox species introduced into the PEDOT matrix.

In this work, an 2D/3D S-scheme graphdiyne (g-CnH2n-2)/carbon-nitrogen vacancies hollow Ni-Fe prussian blue analogues (Ni-Fe-CN PBA) heterojunction (GNF-CN) was prepared for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Ni-Fe-CN PBA were prepared by chemical etching and high temperature calcination. The hollow structure can realize multiple reflections of incident light and effectively improve the light utilization efficiency. The CN vacancy changes the band structure of Ni-Fe PBA and enhances its light absorption capacity. Graphdiyne nanosheets (GDY) prepared by load ball milling can increase the active site. The key lies in the construction of an S-scheme heterojunction between GDY and Ni-Fe-CN PBA, which effectively consume useless holes and increase the utilization rate of photogenerated electrons. The S-scheme electron transfer path are proved by DFT calculation, work function and in situ XPS. The GNF-CN-20 showed excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (3755.02 mu mol h-1 g-1) and photostability compared with GDY (1116.54 mu mol h- 1 g- 1). The present study introduces a novel approach for the construction of an S-scheme heterojunction based on GDY and PBA, enabling wide-spectrum-responsive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Herein, we introduce Ni ions to obtain spherical Prussian blue analog (PBA) doped with Co/Fe/Ni and further to synthesize nitrogen and Co/Fe/Ni co-doped carbon nanotubes (denoted as CoFeNi-CNTs) with small diameters (20-30 nm) by pyrolyzing the mixture of melamine and PBA. The optimized CoFeNi-CNTs have abundant metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) structures and CoFeNi nanoparticles respectively as effective ORR and OER active sites, which lead to outstanding electrocatalytic activities and durability with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V for ORR and an overpotential of 440 mV for OER. Especially, the rechargeable Zn-air battery based on CoFeNi-CNTs catalyst delivers a high peak power density of 138.7 mW cm(-2), specific capacity of 793 mAh g(Zn)(-1) and stable charge-discharge cycling over 500 h, outperforming the Pt/C-RuO2 based devices. And all-solid-state Zn-air battery also displays excellent discharge-charge performance and stability.

To date, it has been widely accepted that a pre-oxidation process with the in-situ generation of the catalytically active high-valence metal sites is essential for promoting the OER behavior of most transition-metal-based OER catalysts, or more felicitously speaking, pre-catalysts. Hence, exploring such pre-catalysts with high pre-oxidation reactivity is of high promise. Herein, we proposed the dual elemental modulation in the cationic and anionic sites of the multi-metal Prussian blue analogue (PBA) pre-catalysts, resulting in promoted OER behavior benefitted from the efficient pre-oxidation ability as well as the multi-metal synergy. Detailed investigations indicate that the Co-containing multimetallic cations and mixed (FeCoIII)-Co-III cyanide anions in NiCuCoII -(FeCoIII)-Co-III PBA (denoted as NiCuCoII -(FeCoIII)-Co-III) are beneficial to OER catalysis owing to the high intrinsic activity guaranteed by the local Co3thorn active sites as well as the optimal multi-metal synergy. After the facile pre-oxidation process, additional high-valence Ni, Cu and Fe ions can be in-situ formed and serve as the active sites, thereby resulting in significantly improved OER behavior. For example, the OER current density of NiCuCoII -FeIIICoIII exhibits 1.81 times enhancement even after 72 h continuous OER catalysis, and the required overpotential for 10 mA cm(-2) reduces from 288 mV for the fresh pre-catalyst to a remarkable record of 251 mV after the pre-oxidation-induced activation, making the optimal PBA-based catalyst a promising candidate for efficient and durable water electrolysis.

Herein, a facile strategy was explored for preparing a hierarchical porous heterostructure of Fe4Ni5S8@ZnIn2S4(FNS@ZIS) by the in situ growth of ZIS nanosheets on Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived bimetallic FNS sulfides. A series of FNS@ZIS hierarchical structures were facilely prepared by adjusting the loading amount (n%) of FNS (n = 19, 26, and 32 for FNS@ZIS-1-3). These structures can efficiently drive the solar co-production of H2 and organic chemicals. The optimal co-production was achieved with FNS@ZIS-2, affording a H-2 evolution rate of 10465 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), along with high selectivity for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (>99.9%). The performance was 22 and 31 times higher than that of FNS and ZIS, respectively, and even superior to the state-of-the-art results achieved using various sacrificial agents. Further mechanistic study indicated that the unique hierarchical core/shell architecture can facilitate interfacial charge separation, afford bimetallic synergy, abundant active sites and excellent photostability. This work highlights a simple and efficient method for preparing porous multimetallic hierarchical structures for the solar co-production of organic chemicals and H-2 fuel.

Growth Mechanisms of Mesoscale Prussian Blue Analogue Particles in Modifier-free Synthesis	CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN												The growth mechanism of mesoscale, 100-500 nm, Prussian blue analogue (PBA) particles synthesized via a modifier-free coprecipitation method was investigated. A series of Co2+ and Ni2+ analogues, RbjCok[M(CN)(6)](l)center dot nH(2)O (M = Cr, Fe, Co) and RbjNik[M(CN)(6)](l)center dot nH(2)O (M = Cr, Fe, Co) are compared, along with the parent Prussian blue and the Cu2+ analogue, rubidium copper hexacyanoferrate. The study finds that growth mechanisms differ among this closely related family of compounds. On the one hand, ex situ transmission electron microscopy and in situ ionic conductivity and DLS analyses indicate the Cu2+ and Ni2+ analogues grow by a traditional heterogeneous precipitation process, whereby nucleated particles grow by addition of ions from solution. On the other hand, the Co2+ analogues and the parent rubidium ferric ferrocyanide grow by aggregation of precursor particles followed by annealing into crystalline mesoscale particles. Understanding of the growth mechanisms is useful for designing routes to mesoscale coordination polymer structures and heterostructures.

Herein, we design a moisture-proof Prussian blue via surface modification of hydrophobic octadecylamine (ODA) chains with a thickness of similar to 6 nm. The hydrophobic Prussian blue (PB@TA@ODA) exhibits excellent sodium storage performance, owing to its high stability in humid environments. After exposure to a humid environment for 7 days, PB@TA@ODA-7D can provide a reversible capacity of 145 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and deliver 94 mAh g(-1) at 30 C. After 100 cycles at 1 C, it still retains 111 mAh g(-1). Further investigations show that the hydrophobic ODA chains can protect PB from H2O attacking the high-spin Fe, thus maintaining structural stability in a humid environment.

J	Gong, A; Zhao, YB; He, MM; Liang, BL; Li, KX				Gong, Ao; Zhao, Yubo; He, Mingming; Liang, Bolong; Li, Kexun			High-performance desalination of three-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon framework reinforced Prussian blue in capacitive deionization	DESALINATION												Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs (PBAs) are emerging as promising intercalation candidates for capacitive deionization (CDI) resulted from their rigid open framework and low-cost synthesis. Nevertheless, PBAs normally have structural deficiencies and low electronic conductivity, which leads to the poor cycling stability and inferior capacity. To address these limitations, the iron-based Prussian blue (FeHCF) is embedded in a three-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon framework (3DNC) in this work. Due to the highly porous structure, 3DNC can serve as an ideal skeletal structure for the growth of FeHCF cubes. The synergistic effect of both composites is mainly reflected on the electrochemical performance, such as high reversible capacity, better cycling stability. Constructing rocking chair desalination cell, FeHCF@3DNC electrode shows high desalination capacity of 60.5 mg g(-1) and excellent repeatability in the cycle. As for energy consumption, the low consumption of 0.30 x 10(3) Wh/m(3) is superior to other materials. Furthermore, it is verified by XPS of FeHCF@3DNC electrode that Fe3+/Fe2+ couple plays a major role in the desalination and regeneration. These results reveal an efficient route for the selection and design of intercalation electrode materials in CDI.

Herein, the nanocubes of carbon-encapsulated NiS2/CoS2 embedded porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrixes (NiS2/CoS2@NC@C) are synthesized as a high-performance anode by in-situ carbonizing and subsequently sulphurating the resorcinol -formaldehyde (RF)-coated Ni-Co-based Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The RF-derived carbon shell acts as a rigid skeleton to effectively relieve the bulk stress during charging and discharging for ensuring the structure integrity, while the porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix improves the electronic conductivity, presents rich channels for ion/electron transfer and inhibits the agglomeration of active material during chemical reaction. In addition, the lattice distortion at the heterogeneous interface of the NiS2/CoS2 allows the redistribution of electrons, promoting the chemical reaction kinetics. Consequently, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C nanocubes exhibit excellent electrochemical properties: a high discharge capacity of 489.9 mA h g-1 after 170 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 (920.6/807.9 mA h g-1 for the initial discharge/charge capacity with the initial coulomb efficiency of 87.7%) and a discharge capacity of 349.7 mA h g-1 with the CE close to 100.0% at 5.0 A g-1 even after 2000 cycles. This study proposes a viable approach for the effective construction of advanced anodes with unique micromor-phology and chemical composition based on bimetallic PBAs for SIBs.

In this work, a prussian blue sample was prepared by a simple precipitation method and the electrochemical performance of the prussian blue (PB) cathode was investigated at various temperatures and in different voltage ranges. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.0 - 4.0 V vs. Na/Na+, the PB cathode exhibited initial discharge capacities of 135.4 mAh g(-1) (55 degrees C), 128.5 mAh g(-1) (25 degrees C) and 99.2 mAh g(-1) (- 10 degrees C) at 10 mA g(-1). The PB cathode showed good cycling stability at low temperature, however the cycling capacity degraded remarkably at elevated temperature. CV test indicated that the capacity fade was mainly due to the side reactions on the electrode-electrolyte interface at near 4.0 V vs. Na/Na+. XPS and FTIR analyses revealed several types of compounds formed on the cathode surface which indicated the complexity of the side reactions. Controlling the high cut-off voltage at 3.8 V vs. Na/Na+ significantly improved the cycling stability of the PB electrode. The PB cathode delivered 1C rate reversible capacity of 100.0 mAh g(-1) in 2.0 - 3.8 V vs. Na/Na+ with outstanding capacity retention of 98.2% after 300 cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, PBA synthesized via common precipitation between a chloride salt and a hexacyano complex are in a form of cubic particles (3D). Herein, nanoplates of PBA prepared via precipitation, without any template, are reported, and their superior electrochemical properties are evaluated. Instead of FeCl3, the precipitation used Fe(NO3)3 and K3Fe(CN)6 as feedstocks to produce nanoplates of Prussian green (2D PG), which can further react with NaI to form nanoplates of Prussian blue (2D PB). Morphologies and chemical composi-tions of the 2D PG depended on reaction temperatures. For example, 2D PG synthesized at 40 degrees C consisted of parallel plates in packs, whereas the one synthesized at 80 degrees C involved perpendicularly packed plates. Optimum electrochemical performances are obtained at a reaction temperature (2D PG's preparation) of 60 degrees C. A 2D-PB-based electrode combined with a polyacrylic acid (PAA)-polyaniline (PANI) (2:1) binder in a half-cell test with Na metal as a reference electrode exhibited high-rate properties (125 and 99 mAh g-1 at current densities of 10 and 500 mA g-1, respectively) and outstanding capacity retention (93% after 300 cycles).

PolyFe was synthesized by the 1:1 complexing of Fe(OAc)(2) and bis-(terpyridyl)benzene and served as a cathodically coloring material. Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) was revealed to be the best anodically coloring material among three PBAs. The complementary electrochromic (EC) pair of polyFe and NiHCF enabled a dramatic decrease of the driving voltage down to 0.8 V in the ECD. We fabricated two ECDs with liquid or solid electrolytes (L-ECD and S-ECD, respectively) and compared their EC properties. S-ECD showed a color change from blue-purple (0 V) to light yellow (0.8 V) with a transmittance change (Delta T) of 45.1% at 580 nm; the response times were 0.52 s for coloring and 1.03 s for bleaching; the coloration efficiency reached a high value of 627.5 cm(2)/C. S-ECD showed better durability than L-ECD in the long term stability test up to 10 000 cycles. In addition, a drastic change in transmittance spectrum between 415 and 655 nm in S-ECD aligned with the highest solar irradiance in the visible region. When exposing the S-ECD to solar irradiation, it was calculated that a large solar irradiance (99.6 W/m(2)) can be attenuated at the colored state (0 V), and only a low power density (0.0243 W/m(2)) was required to keep at the bleached state (0.8 V).

Fast in-situ synthesis of mesoporous Prussian blue-silica nanocomposite for superior silver ions recovery performance	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												BACKGROUND: Mesoporous-nanostructured silica-Prussian blue composite is a highly potential material for silver ions removal and recovery from wastewater. Intense interest has been shown in the use of Prussian blue (PB), one of the important coordinated materials and its analogues in removal of toxic and valuable ions. METHODS: The micro-emulsion template method enables the synthesis of Prussian blue (PB) within silica pores, yielding a nanostructured mesoporous silica-PB composite. This rapid synthesis technique allows for the direct fabrication of the composite from mixed precursor solutions within minutes. The resulting material is effective for selectively extracting silver ions from wastewater at a specific pH level. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In summary, the synthesized SiO2-Prussian blue composite was extensively analyzed using various techniques including XPS, HR-TEM, SEM, STEM-EDX elemental maps, TGA/TDA, and N-2 adsorption/desorption measurements. The composite exhibited a BET surface area of 203 m(2) g(-1) and a total pore volume of approximately 0.283 cm(3) g(-1)with mesopores centered around 20 nm. This mesoporous SiO2-Prussian blue demonstrated significant effectiveness in removing silver ions, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 107.5 mg g(-1). The Langmuir and Sips isotherms showed the best fit among various adsorption isotherm types, with R-2 values exceeding 0.984. Additionally, kinetic analyses revealed that the pseudo-second-order model accurately described the adsorption of silver ions onto the synthesized adsorbent. The nano-particles exhibit remarkable long-term stability, maintaining good reproducibility even after five regeneration cycles. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

In this work, FeNi-Prussian blue analogue (FeNi-PBA) was prepared via a simple co -precipitation method and served as a sacrificial template to prepare iron nickel oxide (NiFe2O4), sulfides (FeS/NiS2) and phosphides (Fe2P/Ni2P), whose capabilities for SCs were compared, respectively. The electrochemical results confirmed that the specific capacitance of FeS/NiS2 was 490.6 F g-1 much higher than those of NiFe2O4 (86 F g-1) and Fe2P/Ni2P (174.6 F g-1) at the current density of 1 A g-1. Therefore, the FeNiSx delivered the best electrochemical properties among them, because FeS/NiS2 composed by FeS/NiS2 heterostructure with sulfur vacancies provided an intimate/compact interfacial arrangement which better synergized the polyatomic conductivity and a large number of redox-active sites to bring about excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, FeS/NiS2 and activated carbon (AC) were employed to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), which achieved the energy density of 54.34 Wh & sdot;kg- 1 and the power density of 1349.13 W & sdot;kg- 1, and could power a commercial light -emitting diode light. Among FeNiOx, FeS/NiS2 and Fe2P/Ni2P, FeS/NiS2 can be a potential electrode material for SCs attributing to its heterostructure and sulfur vacancies favourable for multi -atom conductivity and numerous redox-active sites. This work evidences that metal sulfides deliver the superior SCs` performance than the corresponding metal oxides and phosphides.					唐, 唐/ITT-4286-2023; Hu, Libing/LRC-4073-2024; Li, Bin/JJG-0783-2023														1452-3981					MAR	2024	19	3							100512	10.1016/j.ijoes.2024.100512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoes.2024.100512		FEB 2024											WOS:001205255100001

Here we demonstrate that the glass transformation of cobalt hexacyanoferrate crystals, one of the Prussian blue analogues, increased the concentration of open metal sites and altered the electronic state while maintaining coordination geometries and short-range ordering in the structure. The compositional and structural changes were characterized by X-ray absorption fine structure, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray total scattering. The changes contribute to the flat band potential of the glass becoming closer to the redox potential of CO2 reduction. The valence band energy of the glass also shifts, resulting in lower band gap energy. Both the increased open metal sites and the optimal electronic structure upon vitrification enhance photocatalytic activity toward CO2-to-CO conversions (9.9 mu mol h(-1) CO production) and selectivity (72.4%) in comparison with the crystalline counterpart (3.9 mu mol h(-1) and 42.8%).

All electronic interactions are treated on an equal footing. It is theoretically demonstrated that the divalent cobalt ion reaches 90% of the S = 3/2 value within 20 fs after photoexciting a low-spin Co3+ ion by an iron-to-cobalt charge transfer.

Especially, with the unique unit of metal nanoparticles embedded into the N-doped carbon shell, its derivative is regarded as a candidate in the electromagnetic (EM) absorption field. In this work, CoFe-CNT-PBA, synthesized by the coprecipitation method, was used as precursor to prepare string-bead-like spatial conductive network which is composited by carbon nanotubes (CNT) concatenating units of magnetic CoFe nanoparticles embedded into N-doped carbon shell. To a great extent, the environmental suitability of metal nanoparticles is improved. The result shows, SB-CoFe@C-CN T0.02-800 with microporous and mesoporous has a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of -67.82 dB at 13.74 GHz with 2.20 mm, and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB, RL <= -10 dB) is 7.23 GHz (10.77-18 GHz) at 2.07 mm. At last, MATLAB was used to simulate by building a double-layer absorber, and EAB dramatically reaches 8.35 GHz, which covers mostly the X band and the whole Ku band. The strategy, CNT concatenating porous micro-spheres derived from PBA, induces conduction loss and interface polarization loss, and provides novel and meaningful thinking for the construction of an excellent electromagnetic wave absorption composite.					wang, jiahao/HLV-7669-2023; Yan, Junfeng/GRF-5811-2022; Zhang, Zhipeng/ITV-5132-2023	Yan, Junfeng/0000-0003-0597-558X													0008-6223	1873-3891				AUG 30	2022	196						290	303		10.1016/j.carbon.2022.04.076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.04.076		MAY 2022											WOS:000831013300003

The introduction of Ru3+ into the active catalysts modulated the electronic structure to improve the cell voltage, reaction kinetics, and stability for seawater splitting. In real seawater, the anodically reconstructed Ru-NiFe(O)OH nanosheets reached 50 mA cm(-2) current density at a 260 mV overpotential for oxygen evolution, while Ru-NiFe(OH)(2) at the cathode attained -50 mA cm(-2) current density for hydrogen evolution at only an 83 mV overpotential. The coupling of Ru-NiFe(O)OH and Ru-NiFe(OH)(2) nanosheets as the anode and cathode, respectively, produced 50 mA cm(-2) current density at a cell voltage of 1.58 V for overall seawater splitting, outperforming the RuO2 parallel to Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, 100 h stability was also achieved for the overall seawater splitting.

The microscopic size of m-KMHCF nanocubes could be easily reduced to less than 100 nm as methanol was added to the reaction, over a long range of reaction temperatures and reaction times. As anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the m-KMHCF electrode delivered a high specific capacity of over 900 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) after 50 cycles. In addition, it provided stable rate capability and lithium storage performance at the high current density of 382.3 mAh g(-1) at 5000 mA g(-1). It is worth noting that the capacity continued to rise during the galvanostatic charge-discharge, and the specific capacity increased after charging and discharging at the large current. This phenomenon and the excellent electrochemical performance are mainly derived from the smaller microscopic size, which further led to crystal particle refinement during charge-discharge.

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) appear to be attractive candidates for SIB cathodes because of their open channel structure, compositional and electrochemical tunability. In this paper, the authors present a comprehensive review on the recent advances in the development of PBA frameworks as SIB cathodes with particular attention to the structure-performance correlation of the PBA materials, and discuss the possible strategies to address the problems present in the SIB applications of PBAs. Also, the development of the PBA frameworks for the insertion cathodes of other monovalent and multivalent ions is briefly introduced, with the aim of providing a new insight into the design and development of new host materials for the next-generation advanced batteries.

The adsorption of Cs+ onto soluble PB occurs via ion exchange with a charge-compensation cation like K+, which originally resides in the crystalline lattice. The ratio of the compensation cation sites that are replaced by Cs+ after adsorption time of 2 weeks significantly increases with decreasing crystallite size, meaning that the adsorption occurs only near the surface of the crystallite during the adsorption time. The depth of Cs+ penetration after 2 weeks is only within approximately 1-2 nm (or 1-2 units of the crystalline lattice) from the external surface of the crystallite at ambient temperature, regardless of the crystallite size. Hence, the crystallite size is the most important factor governing the adsorption performance.																			0929-5607	1572-8757				APR	2015	21	3					195	204		10.1007/s10450-015-9662-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10450-015-9662-z													WOS:000351146000004

In particular, copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) and its derivatives from the Prussian Blue family enable a fast and reversible (de-)insertion of zinc ions when operated in a zinc-based aqueous electrolyte. In this work, the effect of the concentration of a zinc sulfate-containing aqueous neutral solution on the aging of CuHCF and copper-zinc hexacyanoferrate mixture (CuZnHCF) was studied. The electrochemical and morphological analysis revealed the occurrence of a phase change during the materials aging. Such phase transformation induced morphological changes, different from the ones formed when the materials were cycled in lower electrolyte concentration. In the case of CuZnHCF, the occurrence of a spike-shaped morphology upon cycling, which appears to be electrochemically inactive, caused a faster capacity fading.

In this study, a new NTE compound has been found, FeFe(CN)(6) Prussian blue analogue, where the average linear coefficient of thermal expansion (alpha(l)) is -4.260 x 10(-6) K-1 between 100 and 450 K. The NTE properties and local vibration dynamics have been investigated by joint experiments of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, X-ray pair distribution function, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. It has been observed that the Fe-C/Fe-N bonds expand with increasing temperature, while the unit cell shrinks in FeFe(CN) 6. The vibration directions of both Fe-C and Fe-N prefer to be perpendicular to the linkage of Fe-CuN-Fe rather than being parallel. More pieces of evidence indicate that the transverse vibrations of N atoms dominate the NTE behavior of FeFe(CN)(6). The present results prove directly that the transverse thermal vibrations of C and N atoms are crucial for the occurrence of the NTE of Prussian blue analogues.

However, things are quite different when it comes to Li-ion batteries, because lithium-containing Li4Fe(CN)6 precursor is not commercially available and thus the traditionally prepared Li-deficient FeFe(CN)6 products fail to couple with commercial graphite anode for full cells. Herein, we put forward a potential matching principle to guide the chemical prelithiation of FeFe(CN)6 into a Li-rich LixFeFe(CN)(6) (x varies from 0 to 2) cathode. The potential matching principle was convincingly confirmed by theoretical analysis and over-lithiation experiments. Perylene-Li reagent was elaborately screened to serve as both Li+ and electron donor for controllable chemical lithiation reaction while preserving the host framework stable. Our work provided a general guiding principle and effective methodology for controllable synthesis of Prussian blue analogues in gradient lithiation depth, which could be served as a platform for in-depth, systematic and comprehensive research on the properties of PBAs materials.

However, the poor electrical conductivity, unavoidable presence of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and crystalline water within the framework, and phase transition during charge-discharge result in inferior electrochemical performance, particularly in terms of rate capability and cycling stability. Here, cobalt-free PBAs are synthesized using a facile and economic co-precipitation method at room temperature, and their sodium-ion storage performance is boosted due to the reduced crystalline water content and improved electrical conductivity via the high-entropy and component stoichiometry tuning strategies, leading to enhanced initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), specific capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability. The optimized HE-HCF of Fe0.60Mn0.10-hexacyanoferrate (referred to as Fe0.60Mn0.10-HCF), with the chemical formula Na1.156Fe0.599Mn0.095Ni0.092Cu0.109Zn0.105 [Fe(CN)6]0.724<middle dot>3.11H2O, displays the most appealing electrochemical performance of an ICE of 100%, a specific capacity of around 115 and 90 mAh<middle dot>g-1 at 0.1 and 1.0 A<middle dot>g-1, with 66.7% capacity retention observed after 1000 cycles and around 61.4% capacity retention with a 40-fold increase in specific current.

However, leaching of metal ions and low recovery efficiency limited the application of heterogeneous AOPs. Herein, we synthesized a Co-Fe bimetallic oxide (Co -Fe -O) derived from Prussian blue analogs to serve as an activator for PAA, efficiently eliminating sulfamethazine (SMZ) in a wide pH range (5-9). Electron paramagnetic resonance and quenching test revealed the coexistence of radical species in the system, and R-O & sdot; were the main factors of SMZ elimination. The steady-state model evaluation showed that 3.1 x 10-14 M R-O & sdot; and 2.05 x 10-14 M & sdot;OH existed in the system. Co-Fe bimetallic synergies expedite the generation of radical species. Based on density functional theory, the aniline ring and heterocyclic ring of SMZ were regarded as the susceptible sites for radical attack and electron transfer. Furthermore, the elimination pathway of SMZ was proposed by combining the results of intermediate products. Additionally, the toxicity of SMZ and intermediates as well as the reaction conditions, water matrices, stability, and oxidation capacity of Co-Fe-O/PAA were subjected to evaluation. Results indicate that the Co-Fe-O/PAA system has significant application potential in the elimination of micropollutants.					jiang, bingyu/GLS-9716-2022; Zhibin, Liu/JJC-4450-2023														2214-7144					APR	2024	60								105121	10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.105121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.105121		MAR 2024											WOS:001246827300001

In this paper, both qualitative and quantitative determination of TMS in bulk, infant milk powder, and frozen cuts-up bovine meat samples were developed to provide consumer safety. In this paper, chemically modified carbon paste with Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles (PbA-NPs /CP) was developed for determination of TMS utilizing cylic voltammetry (CV), square wave voltammetry (SWV) and chronoamperometry methods. In this regard, Prussian blue analogue (PbA) was synthesized by the chemical co-precipitation route. XRD technique was used for crystal structure analysis indicating that the fabricated nanopowder belongs to a cubic structure with lattice constants a = b = c = 10.176AThe grain size was estimated approximately equal 20 nm, and the dislocation density was 25 x 10(-4)nm(-2).

Transmittance and reflectance spectra have been measured through wavelength range from 200 nm to 900 nm. Energy gap (E-g) and refractive index (n) of the films were determined suggesting the strong optical absorption.

The NiCoPBA exhibits a regular cubic shape of 100 nm size, with fluorescence and excellent biocompatibility. In view of the intrinsic cavities, metallic coordination centers, rich C N groups, and pi-pi* interactions of NiCoPBA, the CEA-targeted aptamer strands can be strongly anchored on the surface of nanocubes. Given that the CEA cancer marker is overexpressed on the H460 cell surface of carcinomas, the developed NiCoPBA-based aptasensor not only can be employed to determine CEA in human serum via the formation of stable G-quad-ruplex between aptamer strands and CEA, but also can be utilized to directly detect cancer cells due to the strong binding force between CEA aptamer and cancer cell. The fabricated sensor shows superior sensing performance toward CEA compared with other reported CEA aptasensors, providing an extremely low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.74 fg mL(-1) (1.62 fM) (S/N = 3) in a wide linear range of 1.0 fg mL(-1) to 5.0 ng mL(-1), as well as an LOD of 47 cells mL(-1) for H460 cells.

However, the desalination performance of traditional CDI still cannot meet the requirement of actual operations, which is the limited adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes. Here, we report a feasible and simple strategy for the synthesis of a three-dimensional hierarchical composite with homogeneous Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles, decorating hierarchical porous carbon nanosheet networks (NiHCF@3DC-2) as a redox-active intercalation electrode material for hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI). The interconnected network structure, accompanied by its unique porous characteristic and uniform NiHCF nanoparticles, endows the prepared NiHCF@ 3DC-2 with enough straining space for alleviating the effect of volume change upon the regeneration process and guarantees fast transmission kinetics for both electrons and salt ions. As a consequence, an HCDI cell with NiHCF@3DC-2 and activated carbon showed superior desalination ability with a high ion removal capacity of 47.8 mg g(-1) (107.5 mg g(-1) NiHCF@3DC-2) and good cyclic regenerative performance. Moreover, the Na+ ions storage mechanism and the interfacial synergy of the NiHCF@3DC-2 were also explored by structure and electrochemistry analyses during the CDI process.

The kinetics of VAL conversion is determined and the production of VN is also analyzed using the pseudo first order rate law. In addition, FeFe exhibits the highest catalytic activity to convert VAL to VN with the highest production and selectivity compared to the reported heterogeneous catalysts. FeFe can be also re-used to catalyze conversion of VAL to VN without significant activity loss.

Despite the emergence of sulphide, oxide, and halide-based solid electrolytes for all-solidstate batteries, their utilization is hampered by issues, including the evolution of H2S gas, the need for expensive elements, and poor contact. Here, we first introduce Prussian Blue analogue (PBA) open-framework structures as a solid electrolyte that demonstrates appreciable Na+ conductivity (> 10 (-2)mScm (-1)). We delve into the relationship between Na+ conductivity and the lattice parameter of N-coordinated transition metal, which is attributed to the reduced interaction between Na+ and the framework, corroborated by the distribution of relaxation times and density functional theory calculations. Among the five PBAs studied, Mn-PBA have exhibited the highest Na+ conductivity of 9.1x10(-2)mScm (-1). Feasibility tests have revealed that Mn-PBA have maintained a cycle retention of 95.1% after 80cycles at 30 degrees C and a C-rate of 0.2C.

However, developments in PBAs have centred solely on their crystalline state, and the glassy state of PBAs has not been explored. Here we describe the preparation of the glassy state of PBAs via a mechanically induced crystal-to-glass transformation and explore their properties. The preservation of short-range metal-ligand-metal connectivity is confirmed, enabling the framework-based functionality and semiconductivity in the glass. The transformation also generates unconventional CN- vacancies, followed by the reduction of metal sites. This leads to significant porosity enhancement in recrystallised PBA, enabled by further accessibility of isolated micropores. Finally, mechanical stability under stress for successful vitrification is correlated to defect contents and interstitial water. Our results demonstrate how mechanochemistry provides opportunities to explore glassy states of molecular framework materials in which the stable liquid state is absent.

However, the controllable modulation of the PB/PBA crystallinity still remains an intractable challenge. Herein, we propose a balanced coordination principle to prepare low-defect Prussian blue (LD-PB) materials for outstanding sodium energy storage. Sodium carboxymethylcellulose is demonstrated as a moderate chelating agent to regulate the precipitation of LD-PB with negligible trace of vacancies and crystal water molecules. The high-crystalline open framework permits superfast and highly reversible sodium insertion/extraction. Impressively, an unprecedented specific capacity of 101 mAh g(-1) is achieved at an ultrahigh rate of 100 C in combination with remarkable capacity retention of 97.4% over a 3000-cycling test. The present study will shed a fundamental insight into the balanced coordination strategy for advancing the PB/PBA cathode materials toward superfast and durable alkali metal energy storage.

Herein, we show that the water oxidation activities of catalytic cobalt sites in a Prussian blue (PB) structure could be tuned systematically by decorating its coordination sphere with a combination of cyanide and bidentate pyridyl groups. K-0.1[Co(bpy)](2.9)[Fe(CN)(6)](2) ([Cobpy-Fe]), K-0.2[Co(phen)](2.8)[Fe(CN)(6)](2) ([Cophen-Fe]), {[Co(bpy)(2)](3) [Fe(CN)(6)](2) 1[Fe(CN)(6)](1/3) ([Cobpy2-Fe]), and {[Co(phen)(2)](3)[Fe(CN)(6)](2)}[Fe(CN)(6)](1/3) CI0.11 ([Cophen2 - Fe]) were prepared by introducing bidentate pyridyl groups (phen: 1,10-phenanthroline, bpy: 2,2'-bipyridine) to the common synthetic protocol of Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues. Characterization studies indicate that [Cobpy2-Fe] and [Cophen2-Fe] adopt a pentanu- clear molecular structure, while [Cobpy-Fe] and [Cophen-Fe] could be described as cyanide-based coordination polymers with lower-dimensionality and less crystalline nature compared to the regular Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA), K0.1Co2.9[Fe(CN)(6)](2)([Co-Fe]). Photocatalytic studies reveal that the activities of [Cobpy-Fe] and [Cophen-Fe] are significantly enhanced compared to those of [Co-Fe], while molecular [Cobpy2-Fe] and [Cophen2-Fe] are inactive toward water oxidation. [Cobpy-Fe] and [Cophen-Fe] exhibit upper-bound turnover frequencies (TOFs) of 1.3 and 0.7 s(-1), respectively, which are similar to 50 times higher than that of [Co-Fe] (1.8 X 10(-2) s(-1)). The complete inactivity of [Cobpy2-Fe] and [Cophen2-Fe] confirms the critical role of aqua coordination to the catalytic cobalt sites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Computational studies show that bidentate pyridyl groups enhance the susceptibility of the rate-determining Co(IV)-oxo species to the nucleophilic water attack during the critical O-O bond formation. This study opens a new route toward increasing the intrinsic water oxidation activity of the catalytic sites in PB coordination polymers.					ghobadi, turkan/AAB-1917-2020; Karadas, Ferdi/D-7140-2012; Dede, Yavuz/AIC-4285-2022	Buyuktemiz, Muhammed/0000-0001-6361-5473; Dede, Yavuz/0000-0003-4854-8422; Karadas, Ferdi/0000-0001-7171-9889; Ahmad, Aliyu Aremu/0000-0002-3118-4872													0020-1669	1520-510X				MAR 7	2022	61	9					3931	3941		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03531								35200012					WOS:000793863700013

However, their synthesis in the form of nanoparticles with controlled size, shape and organization remains a challenge faced by diverse scientific communities. Ordered mesoporous silica monolith with 2D-hexagonal structure of the mesopores is used to form ferromagnetic NiFe Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanoparticles with anisotropic shape. The PBA nanowires formed within the nanochannels of the monolith are made of single chains of nanocrystals. Furthermore, when using an ordered mesoporous silica monolith instead of the more frequently used mesoporous powders a parallel organization of the pores is achieved over whole macroscopic fragments of the monolith. A 1 x 1 x 1 mm(3) fragment of monolith exhibits a remarkably strong anisotropy in its magnetic properties, arising from unprecedented magnetic dipolar interaction along the chains of coordination nanocrystals, which is spread to the macroscopic scale thanks to the long-range organization of the pores. As various confined chemistries can be developed within the ordered porosity of such monolith, this tool opens up new opportunities for the development of original nanostructured materials exhibiting anisotropy in their properties at the macroscopic scale.

NaCu[Fe(CN)(6)] (NaCuHCF) and ligand-modified PBAs, NaxCu[Fe(CN)(5)(C6H4N2)] (NaxCuCNPFe), and NaxCu[Fe(CN)(5)(CH3C6H4NH2)] (Na(x)CuTolFe) were tested in different electrolytes. The NaxCuCNPFe and Na(x)CuTolFe cathodes exhibited the best capacity retention of similar to 50% after 2000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4, which is much higher than that of the NaCuHCF cathode (0% capacity remained after 2000 cycles). To understand the charge-discharge mechanism of PBA cathodes, in situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were performed. To demonstrate practical energy storage appli-cations, PBAs were tested in full-cell configurations with an anode made of sodium titanium phosphate (NTP) coated with reduced graphene oxide and carbon (NTP@C@RGO). The NaxCuCNPFe//NTP@C@RGO and Na-x-CuTolFe//NTP@C@RGO full cells in 17 m NaClO4 aqueous electrolyte exhibited high power densities of up to 4338 W kg(-1) (with an energy density of 18.11 Wh kg(-1)) and 4742 W kg(-1) (with an energy density of 11.87 Wh kg(-1)), respectively.

Fabricated core-shelled NiFe2O4 /NiO@Fe2O3 nanocubes produced with the PBA precursor that soaked in the solution of ferrous ion with the highest concentration in this work appears the most stable capacity during cycles, because of its more homogeneous Fe2O3 layer surface and more complete crystal.

Herein, we reported a feasible strategy for preparing a trimetallic (NiCoFe) superior electrocatalyst with a novel open-cage/3D frame-like structure for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is prepared by consequent thermal treatments of a CoFe Prussian blue analogue frame/cage-like structure under an argon (CoFeA-TT) atmosphere and then electrochemical deposition of nickel-cobalt sulfide nanosheets as a shell layer on it. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the deposition of NiCo-S on CoFeA-TT (NiCo-S@CoFeA-TT) has the best catalytic performance and can drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 268 mV with a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) and an excellent long-term catalytic stability in an alkaline medium. Its outstanding electrocatalytic performances are endowed from frame/cage-like structures, highly exposed active sites, accelerated mass and electron transport, and the synergistic effect of multiple hybrid components. The NiCo-S@CoFeA-TT showed a better performance than most advanced nonprecious catalysts and the noble commercial RuO2 catalyst. This study exhibited an effective and efficient procedure to design 3D porous architecture catalysts for the energy-relevant electrocatalysis reaction.

Herein, The CoP/Cu3P (Co-Cu-P) nanocubes were designed using Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as a template through the calcination phosphating method. The novel crystalline-amorphous Co-Cu-P/GDY p-n heterostructures photocatalyst was prepared by a stir-assisted low- temperature water bath method. Under visible light irradiation, the hydrogen evolution efficiency of the Co-Cu-P/GDY-3 heterostructures reached 4790.0 mu mol g- 1 h- 1 , surpassing that of GDY (523.9 mu mol g- 1 h- 1 ) and Co-Cu-P (2458.5 mu mol g- 1 h- 1 ). The remarkable hydrogen evolution activity of the composite catalyst can be attributed to the presence of p-n heterojunction, while the crystalline-amorphous structure promotes efficient interfacial charge transfer. Additionally, the rough and porous nature of the Co-Cu-P/GDY heterostructures surface facilitates mass transfer and hydrogen diffusion during photocatalysis. The charge transfer pathway of the p-n heterojunction was confirmed through various characterizations, including photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VBXPS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and other relevant techniques. This study offers a fresh perspective on designing PBA derivatives with graphdiyne (GDY) to construct heterostructure photocatalysts for enhanced photocatalytic performance.					li, feiyang/KHW-5210-2024														0360-3199	1879-3487				JAN 13	2025	98						170	183		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.12.036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.12.036		DEC 2024											WOS:001378087400001

Herein, we report a polyaniline-encapsulated hollow Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (CFP@PANI) for separator modification. The open frame-like hollow CFP was synthesized via oriented attachment (OA). To improve the catalytic effect and electrical conductivity, PANI was coated on the synthesized CFP. The resulting CFP@PANI was applied on the conventional polypropylene (PP) separator (CFP@PANI-PP) with vacuum filtration. With a ketjen black/sulfur (KB/S) cathode with 66% of the sulfur load, the CFP@PANI-PP exhibited an initial capacity of 723.1 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). Furthermore, the CFP@PANI-PP showed stable cycling performance with 83.5% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 A g(-1). During the 100 cycles, each cycle maintained high coulombic efficiency above 99.5%, which indicates that the CFP@PANI-PP could inhibit LiPS migration to the anode side without a Li+ transport disturbance across the separator. Overall, the CFP@PANI-PP efficiently suppressed LiPSs, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance. The current study provides useful insight into designing a nanostructure for separator modification of Li-S batteries.

Herein, we reported the preparation of a series of Mn- Fe oxides-based hybrids using Mn-Fe PBA as a template and an organic carbon source by calcination. The study focuses on revealing the interaction between the microstructure and electrochemical perfor-mance of the products obtained at different calcination temperatures. Notably, the as-derived porous Fe- Fe0.33Mn0.67O/C nanocubes (i.e., M600) exhibited the best rate capability and cycle life compared with other samples ( similar to 890 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g, 626.8 mAh/g after 10 0 0 cycles at 1.0 A/g with a 99% capacity re-tention). These can be attributed to the fact that the porous structure provides shorter Li + diffusion path and promotes the penetration of electrolyte. Besides, the N -doped C formed by the carbonization of or-ganic ligands can buffer the volume change and prevent the aggregation of Fe0.33Mn0.67O nanoparticles during the discharge/charge cycles. Moreover, the presence of metallic Fe enhances the conductivity and the electrochemical activity, which accelerates the electrochemical reactions. Therefore, reasonable design of microstructure and compositions of functional nanocomposites is the key to obtain ideal electrochem-ical properties.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

The corresponding NiFe2O4-NiO@C composites with excellent crystallization were prepared by two-stage oxidation at low temperature. The microstructure and electrochemical behavior of the materials showed that the Prussian blue analog was transformed into metal oxide while the carbon coating was maintained in the two-stage oxidation at low temperature. The existence of the carbon coating reduces the charge transfer impedance to 31.5 omega. At the current density of 500 mA/g, the reversible capacity of 632.7 mAh/g is maintained after 500 cycles. At the same time, carbon cladding can also enhance the role of pseudocapacitance in the material. At the scanning rate of 0.1 mV/s, the pseudocapacitance account for 54.4% of the total discharge capacity, which is significantly higher than that of uncoated materials.

In this study, a facile synthesis procedure was developed for preparing high-performance ammonium adsorbent via in-situ immobilization of Prussian blue analog, viz. copper hex-acyanoferrate (CuHCF) on a weakly acidic cation exchange resin (WAC) without any pretreatment. From the analysis of physicochemical properties of the synthesized CuHCF-based adsorbents using powder X-ray diffrac-tometry, Fourier-transform infrared attenuated total-reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it was found that CuHCF appears to be located on the surface of WAC, allowing access to NH4+ for adsorption. The pseudo-second-order kinetics model fits best suggesting that the adsorption of ammonium occurring was chemisorption. The isotherm model that fit best was the Langmuir isotherm, which showed that the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity was 47.07 mg NH4+ per g of WAC-CuHCF at pH 6.5. The adsorption efficiency of NH4+ changed slightly in the presence of Na+ and decreased by only similar to 10 % in the presence of K+. The ability of WAC-CuHCF to regenerate was also assessed in the column test, and the regenerated adsorbent was found to adsorb and desorb NH4+ to essentially the same extent. Thus, WAC-CuHCF developed in this study, which could be prepared in a facile synthesis method, is promising as a regenerative adsorbent material for the selective adsorption of NH4+ ions over a wide pH range and can be applied for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation.

However, low efficiency remains a significant challenge for this technology. In this study, we synthesized novel graphitic carbon nitride (GCN)- Prussian blue analog (PBA) heterostructure composites using suitable PBAs for photocatalytic reactions, and explored their application in visible-light-induced H2 production. GCN-PBA heterostructure composites were synthesized using PBAs containing Ni, Co, and Fe, and their photocatalytic activities under visible light irradiation were compared. The visible-light absorption characteristics and H2 production efficiency of the GCN-PBA composites were characterized. The GCN-NiFe heterostructure composite showed excellent visible-light-induced H2 production efficiency, indicating effective charge separation and transfer characteristics that enhanced the photocatalytic activity of GCN. These findings contribute to the development of efficient photocatalytic materials for solar H2 production, thereby contributing to the advancement of renewable energy technologies.

However, several key challenges, such as low actual capacity and high voltage instability, restrain their further development. Here, we investigate the influence of pH value on the electro-chemical performances of Na2MnFe(CN)(6) cathodes during co-precipitation process. When the pH equals to 3.0, the sample shows the high content of sodium, low contents of interstitial water molecules and Fe(CN)(6) defects, which achieves a high discharge capacity (similar to 130.6 mAh g(-1)) and a capacity retention of 72% after 100 cycles at 1C. As the pH becomes 9.0, the sample exhibits an excellent high-rate capability, and the discharge capacity can still remain about 92% when the rate goes back to 0.1C from 5C. Besides, the sample also reveals capacity retention of about 80% after 100 cycles at 1C, which shows the best stability among all samples. The enhanced performances could be mainly ascribed to two aspects: on the one hand, the high content of Na+ contributes to high specific capacity; on the other hand, less Fe(CN)(6) defects are beneficial to Na+ ion diffusion and stabilize the structure during the Na+ insertion/extraction process.

Focusing on this topic, electrocatalytic oxidation reactions including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are highly attractive, which could be involved as efficient anodic reactions to couple the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) more efficiently. Currently, abundant transition metal-based catalysts have been explored for OER and UOR, while few bifunctional catalysts with versatile application range are reported, and the current activity and operational stability are still unsatisfied. Herein, we proposed a self-sacrificial templated route to fabricate uniform CuFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes grown on Cu(OH)2 nanoarrays as efficient pre-catalysts for both OER and UOR catalysis. After undergoing a pre-oxidation process with substantial accumulation of the active species, highly efficient and ultrastable electro-oxidation behavior can be achieved for promoted OER and UOR. Typically, an ultralow onset potential of 1.423 V vs. RHE with high catalytic current density can be achieved for OER, and an ultralow potential of 1.248 V vs. RHE is required for the optimized catalyst to achieve a 10 mA cm-2 UOR current density. Of note, over 300 h and 150 h stable current can be realized for OER and UOR, accompanied by dramatic increment of the activities. The discovery of the PBA-based pre-catalysts and the investigation of the pre-oxidation process could give useful guidance for future designing of advanced catalysts for the electro-oxidation reactions.

J	Wu, MS; Ceng, ZZ				Wu, Mao-Sung; Ceng, Zhi-Zhen			Bamboo-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes formed by direct pyrolysis of Prussian blue analogue as a counter electrode material for dye-sensitized solar cells	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												Nitrogen-doped carbon materials were prepared by direct pyrolysis of nanostructured Prussian blue analogue (metal hexacyanoferrates) without additional carbon sources and metal catalysts. The pyrolysis temperature played a crucial role in determining the structure of resultant carbon materials. Bamboo-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) could be formed at a pyrolysis temperature of 700 degrees C, while only the nitrogen-doped carbon spheres (NCNSs) were obtained at 500 degrees C. After removal of metal catalysts, the bamboo-like NCNTs exhibited superior electrocatalytic behavior towards I /I-3 than the hollow NCNSs, primarily due to their higher surface area and electrical conductivity in comparison with NCNSs. The photoelectron conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) using NCNT counter electrode reached 7.48%, which was even better than that using Pt counter (7.12%) and much higher than that using NCNS counter (5.53%). The improved photovoltaic performance of DSC employing metal-free NCNT counter electrode was primarily attributed to the significantly reduced diffusion and charge-transfer resistances in porous NCNT catalyst layer in comparison with the compact NCNS electrode.

Herein, we developed a drug-free three-layered photothermal bactericide from inside to outside consisting of copper sulfide (CuS), gold (Au) and zinc-doped Prussian blue analogues (ZnPBA) (named as CuS@Au@ZnPBA). The CuS@Au@ZnPBA was demonstrated to possess remarkably-improved photothermal property and excellent biosafety. Local heat generated by CuS@Au@ZnPBA under the irradiation of 808 nm laser enables efficient bacteria ablation in vitro and in a mouse model of cutaneous wound infection. Meanwhile, the released zinc ions (Zn2+) could upregulate the genes involved in collagen deposition to accelerate wound healing. Overall, the finely-designed nanocomposites can serve as a promising kind of antibacterial alternative to current antibiotic therapies against bacterial wound infections. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

This study explores two HE-PBAs: Na2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Fe(CN)6 (HE-PBA-1) and Na2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2Fe(CN)6 (HE-PBA-2). Both crystallize in monoclinic (P21/n) symmetry, but HE-PBA-1, with Cu, exhibits a lower bandgap, lower Na-ion diffusion barrier, higher [Fe(CN)6] vacancy, and smaller particle size compared to HE-PBA-2 with Zn. These factors result in higher power capability for HE-PBA-1 due to its enhanced electronic conductivity and Na-ion diffusivity. Additionally, its higher [Fe(CN)6] vacancy and smaller particle size offer more electrochemical active sites, improving energy characteristics. A Na-ion full cell with HE-PBA-1 as the positive electrode and a mixed-metallic sodium-copper-iron oxide (NaCuFe-Oxide) as the negative electrode in a hydrogel electrolyte is assembled. It achieves a specific capacity of 94 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1, an energy density of 70 Wh kg-1 at 74 W kg-1, a power density of 375 W kg-1 at 57 Wh kg-1, and excellent durability with 89% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 200 mA g-1 within a 0-2 V window.

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are one kind of earth-abundant, nonprecious-based catalyst which has been classified as a viable alternative and active for HER. While the performance remains inferior to Pt which primarily targets durability under high current density, pinpointing the reconfiguration strategy would be critical to their catalytic competency. Herein, we reported engineered N-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQD) on the surface of bimetallic CoFe phosphide (CoFeP) derived from cobalt iron Prussian blue analogue (CoFePBA) as an efficient HER. By introducing the NGQD, the surface architect and electronic state of the transition metal are altered through an adjusted electronic configuration and thus, improving the electrocatalytic activity for HER. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) highlighting the role of NGQD, which successfully induced the electron density of Co atoms, further expedites its conductivity and electroactivity. The optimized NGQD/CoFeP substantially surpasses an overpotential of 70 mV (vs. RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Furthermore, the NGQD/ CoFeP maintains its exceptional stability under an extremely high current density of 600 mA cm-2 after 12 h of continuous operation. Our findings show that NGQD/CoFeP might demonstrate as a viable alternative to the conventional Pt electrocatalyst in commercial water splitting for hydrogen generation.

But they often suffer from low conductivity and severe crystal phase transition, resulting in inferior desalination capacity and poor cycling stability. Herein, the dual strategy of structural optimization and carbon-based materials introduction is proposed to enhance the desalination performance of PBAs. Stepwise hollow structure formed by surface etching has been proved to be more outstanding than cubic structure. Enlarged the specific surface area, the contact area with the electrolyte increases, therefore, more active sites are exposed. Besides, the etching of external surfaces provides more buffer space, improves the tolerance to crystal phase transition, and enhances the cycling stability. The introduction of carbon nanotubes brings high conductivity. Specifically, the desalination test shows that stepwise hollow Prussian blue/carbon nanotubes composite delivers a high desalination capacity of 103.4 mg g(-1) with outstanding cycling stability. Moreover, the low energy consumption of 0.23 Wh g(-1) is also suitable for practical application. The dual strategy opens a window to design advanced electrode materials for CDI.

Herein, by simply controlling synthesis temperature, a bimetallic PBA-derived O,N-codoped Ni-Fe carbide, can be well tuned to optimize structure and OER performance. Importantly, by a series of ex situ and in situ investigations, real active species of NiFeOxHy are in situ formed on the surface during the OER, which reveals a "pre-catalyst" role of O,N-codoped Ni-Fe carbides. Furthermore, it has been successfully applied to highly efficient Zn-air batteries and outplays its RuO2 counterpart. When applied to photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation as the co-catalyst, it improves the performance of the BiVO4 photoanode by enhancing hole collecting and transporting ability. We believe this research not only provides a highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst for the OER, but also unveils the "pre-catalyst" role of PBA-derived materials in energy-storage and conversion devices.

The structures of ordered defects in thiocyanate analogues of Prussian Blue	CHEMICAL SCIENCE												We report the structures of six new divalent transition metal hexathiocyanatobismuthate frameworks with the generic formula , M = Mn, Co, Ni and Zn. These frameworks are defective analogues of the perovskite-derived trivalent transition metal hexathiocyanatobismuthates M-III[Bi(SCN)(6)]. The defects in these new thiocyanate frameworks order and produce complex superstructures due to the low symmetry of the parent structure, in contrast to the related and more well-studied cyanide Prussian Blue analogues. Despite the close similarities in the chemistries of these four transition metal cations, we find that each framework contains a different mechanism for accommodating the lowered transition metal charge, making use of some combination of Bi(SCN)(6)(3-) vacancies, M-Bi antisite defects, water substitution for thiocyanate, adventitious extra-framework cations and reduced metal coordination number. These materials provide an unusually clear view of defects in molecular framework materials and their variety suggests that similar richness may be waiting to be uncovered in other hybrid perovskite frameworks.

Prussian blue has been widely studied and used as an antidote for humans exposed to acute internal contamination by Cs-137, due to its ability to act as a selective adsorption agent and to its negligible toxicity. In the present work, the synthesis protocol has been revisited avoiding the use of organic solvents to obtain Prussian blue nanoparticles with morphological and textural properties, which positively influence its Cs(+)binding capacity compared to a commercially available Prussian blue sample. The reduction of the particle size and the increase in the specific surface area and pore volume values compared to the commercial Prussian blue reference led to a more rapid uptake of caesium in simulated enteric fluid solution (+35% after 1 h of contact). Then, after 24 h of contact, both solids were able to remove >98% of the initial Cs(+)content. The Prussian blue nanoparticles showed a weak inhibition of the bacterial luminescence in the aqueous phase and no chronic detrimental toxic effects.

Rare earth Tb3+ ion was doped in NiCo-PBA to prepare a complex with strong fluorescence performance (represented by NiCo-PBA@Tb3+). The NiCo-PBA@Tb3+ complex was functionalized with poly(ethyleneglycol)- dimethacrylate (PEGMA) (represented by NiCo-PBA@Tb3+ @PEGMA) by the surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization to enhance its aqueous stability, pH-responsive capability, and good biocompatibility, thus improving the drug-loading efficiency of NiCo-PBA. An aptamer ligand (AS1411) targeting nucleolin was insensitively anchored onto the NiCoPBA@Tb3+ @PEGMA surface for specifically recognizing breast cancer cells. Therefore, the functionalization of NiCo-PBA@Tb3+ @PEGMA with AS1411 (denoted by NiCo-PBA@Tb3+ @PEGMA@AS1411) allowed the pH-responsive drug release within cancer cells and enhanced the tumor-targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX). Confocal fluorescence imaging revealed that the NiCo-PBA@Tb3+ @PEGMA@AS1411 composite was mainly located in the cytoplasm after cellular internalization, and released DOX within the cytoplasm. The in vivo antitumor study with tumor-bearing mice illustrated that NiCo-PBA@Tb3+ @PEGMA@AS1411@DOX considerably accumulated in tumor tissues. The tumor growth can be effectively suppressed and exhibited enhanced an anticancer activity in vivo. The proposed NiCo-PBA@Tb3+@PEGMA@AS1411 composite represents a growing potential for effective DOX delivery and targeted therapy in vitro and in vivo. The present work can extend the application of PBAs in cancer therapy and cell imaging and provides a new strategy for the con- struction of controlled release system of anticancer drugs.

Herein, discarded biomass (pomelo peel, PP) is used as raw material and in-situ grew NiFe-Prussian blue analogues on its surface. Then a novel 3D binder-free and self standing NiFe@NC/PPC electrode is obtained through the carbonization process and directly used as a cathode in Li-O-2 batteries. Compared with PPC (carbonized pomelo peel) and NiFe@NC/CP (NiFe@NC catalysts coated on carbon paper), NiFe@NC/PPC gathered the advantageous characteristics of i) efficient diffusion rates for O-2/electrolyte and ii) good catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The as fabricated Li-O-2 batteries, with NiFe@NC/PPC as cathode, are performed a relatively high specific capacity (13.79 mAh cm(-2)), a long cycle life (290 cycles) at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2). Therefore, considering the convenience of synthesis method and the inexpensive raw materials, this is a feasible way to prepare high performance and low cost cathodes for Li-O-2 batteries.

J	Park, JS; Yang, S; Kang, YC				Park, Jin-Sung; Yang, Sungjin; Kang, Yun Chan			Prussian blue analogue nanocubes with hollow interior and porous walls encapsulated within reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and their sodium-ion storage performances	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted considerable research attention due to their functional characteristics such as tailorable architecture and adjustable pore sizes. In particular, the assembly of such MOFs has been widely studied because of their unprecedented physicochemical properties. In this paper, a strategy is presented for the synthesis of nanostructure-tunable MOFs assembled within reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets via colloidal spray pyrolysis process. The spray pyrolysis of Prussian blue nanocubes and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets dispersed in an aqueous solution, and the subsequent sulfidation heat-treatment yields Prussian blue analogue nanocubes with a hollow interior and porous walls encapsulated within rGO. Through spray pyrolysis process, large-scale synthesis of nanostructure-tunable MOFs assembled within rGO nanosheets could be realized in one-pot process. The MOFs can be uniformly encapsulated within rGO nanosheets through spray pyrolysis process, which is beneficial for improving cycle and rate performances, when applied as the anode material for sodium ion batteries. In particular, the rGO matrix acts as a highway for electron transport, resulting in remarkable discharge capacities of 413 mA h g(-1), even at a high current density of 10 A g(-1). To provide supplementary structural integrity for a longer cycle life, polydopamine-derived N-doped carbon is coated on the spherical composite, and the electrochemical performance of the anode material for sodium ion storage is analyzed in detail. It is believed that this strategy could pave the way towards the synthesis of superstructures filled with structure-tunable MOFs that have wide applicability.

However, PBAs suffer poor cyclability due to irreversible phase transition in deep charge/discharge states. PBAs also suffer low crystallinity, with considerable [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies, and coordinated water in crystal frameworks. Presently, a new chelating agent/surfactant coassisted crystallization method is developed to prepare high-quality (HQ) ternary-metal NixCo1-x[Fe(CN)(6)] PBAs. By introducing inactive metal Ni to suppress capacity fading caused by excessive lattice distortion, these PBAs have tunable limits on depth of charge/discharge. HQ-NixCo1-x[Fe(CN)(6)] (x = 0.3) demonstrates the best reversible Na-storage behavior with a specific capacity of approximate to 145 mA h g(-1) and a remarkably improved cycle performance, with approximate to 90% capacity retention over 600 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, a dual-insertion full cell on the cathode and NaTi2(PO4)(3) anode delivers reversible capacity of approximate to 110 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 1.0 C without capacity fading over 300 cycles, showing promise as a high-performance SIB for large-scale energy-storage systems. The ultrastable cyclability achieved in the lab and explained herein is far beyond that of any previously reported PBA-based full cells.					miao, ling/A-9491-2013; han, jiantao/F-8021-2010; Luo, Jiahuan/KGK-5833-2024; Shen, Yi/GRS-3602-2022; Huang, Yunhui/L-6536-2019; wei, peng/IVH-1711-2023; Huang, xu/JDD-1638-2023; Peng, Jian/AGE-7840-2022	Yin, Jinwen/0000-0001-6574-4391; Wei, Peng/0000-0002-4432-8978; Luo, Jiahuan/0000-0003-3194-6520; Peng, Jian/0000-0002-4624-054X													1614-6832	1614-6840				APR 16	2018	8	11							1702856	10.1002/aenm.201702856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aenm.201702856													WOS:000430163100027

This method employs poly(4-vinylpyridine)/P4VP stabilized polystyrene/PS nanoparticles as a template to define the position of Prussian blue product. In the first step, the templates of P4VP-stabilized polystyrene polymer nanoparticle were prepared by dispersion polymerization of styrene in methanol/water in the presence of macro-P4VP chain transfer agents. With the addition of sodium pentacyanoammineferroate(II) hydrate/[Fe(CN)(5)NH3](3-)into dispersion, pyridyl moieties in P4VP in polymeric nanoparticles could react with [Fe(CN)(5)NH3](3-)through a ligand exchange reaction. Subsequent metal coordination polymerization of Fe(3+)with ferrate confined within the surface of the nanoparticles led to the generation of monodispersed PB coated polymeric nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were characterized and confirmed by various modern techniques such as FT-IR, UV-Vis, TGA, XPS, TEM, SEM and AFM. The UV-Vis, FT-IR, TGA and XPS studies suggested Prussian blue was successfully coordinated with P4VP-PS polymers template according to our experimental design. The morphology studies indicated that spherical nanoparticles were obtained. In particular, the EDX mapping results clearly show that the iron element is evenly distributed on the nanoparticles. In addition, two parameters, including the amount of initiator and the amount of iron in the system, have important effects on the particle size and distribution. This experimental system we designed has great potential for the synthesis of metal containing polymeric nanoparticles with other compositions and morphologies, which offers many possibilities worthy of further exploration.					李, 奕/IVV-2344-2023; Wu, Lin/B-3210-2017	Wu, Lin/0000-0001-9175-1093													1574-1443	1574-1451				DEC	2020	30	12					5074	5084		10.1007/s10904-020-01625-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10904-020-01625-3		JUN 2020											WOS:000539934300001

Herein, cubic NiCo-Prussian blue analogue (PBA)/ flower-like FeNi layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure was facilely in-situ formed on porous nickel foam (NF) via hydrothermal strategy coupled by subsequent sulfurizing treatment (named as S-FeNi LDH@PBA/NF), showing largely facilitated electron transfer over homogeneous counterpart. Also, we investigated the effects of different Fe/Ni feeding ratios on their catalytic properties in some detail. The as-prepared S-FeNi LDH@PBA/NF demonstrated the superior OER activity (e.g. only 243 mV of overpotential required for 50 mA cm2) and stability. Accordingly, using the catalyst as anode, the home-assembled S-FeNi LDH@PBA/NF//Pt/C/NF electrolyzer exhibited small Tafel slope (83.1 mV dec1) and ultra-stability, showing the potential feasibility in practical water electrolysis. This strategy provides a hopeful model to enhance the OER performance by effectively constructing advanced catalyst with promising heterostructure and optimal electronic structure.

The exploration of new electrode materials and their comparative study with contemporary resources will help the design of advanced electrodes. Here, we have synthesized a new type of Prussian blue analogue (cerium(III) hexacyanocobaltate, CeHCCo) and systematically explored the effect of valence states of Fe2+ and Ce3+ on crystal structure and electrochemical properties of final products. We demonstrate that the unbalanced charge in iron(II) hexacyanocobaltate (FeHCCo), as opposed to that in CeHCCo, results in more residual K+ ions, thereby leading to the occupancy of cavities. As a result, the Kt ion-rich FeHCCo exhibits lower capacities of 55 +/- 3 and 15 +/- 3 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 1 A g(-1), respectively, compared with the K+ ion-deficient CeHCCo that exhibits capacities of 242 +/- 3 and 111 +/- 3 mAh g(-1) at the same current densities.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising cathode materials for CIB, but they suffer from limited capacity and poor cyclability. Herein, a new PBA cathode NiCoHCF is designed with electrochemical active Co and inactive Ni. During charge and discharge process, active Co with limited redox contributes extra reversible capacity along with Fe, while inactive Ni stabilizes the structure and elevates the activity of low-spin Fe, thus enhancing rate capability and contributing capacitance capacity. By the synergistic effect of Co and Ni, the obtained PBAs cathode exhibits much better electrochemical performance than PBAs with only Co (CoHCF) or Ni (NiHCF). In-situ X-ray diffraction proves highly reversible structure evolution of NiCoHCF during cycling. X-ray adsorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculation reveal that, the activity of Co is suppressed, while that of Fe is promoted in NiCoHCF compared with CoHCF. The design strategy opens up new opportunities for the development of CIB cathode materials.

In this work, an Fe Prussian blue analog was grown in situ on the surface of NiCo precursor nanoneedles at room temperature, and then one-dimensional unique NiCoP@FeP hierarchical nanocomposites were constructed by subsequent phosphating. The optimized NiCoP@FeP with strong electronic interactions showed a low overpotential of 268 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for the OER and 75 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER. Moreover, for water splitting, the bifunctional catalyst required only a low cell voltage of 1.58 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent durability.

However, the persistence of issues related to the limited electrocatalytic activity of such materials and their poor stability under operating conditions makes developing highly active, stable, platinum-group-metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) necessary. We report the development of Prussian blue analogues (PBA)-derived NiFe-based electrocatalysts through a mild aqueous phase precipitation method, followed by thermal stabilization and phosphorus doping. The formation of the NiFe-PBA-precursor with a framework nanocubic Ni(II)[Fe(III)(CN)6]2/3 structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma analysis. The NiFe-PBAprecursor was subjected to thermal stabilization and phosphorus doping to provide the material with enhanced OER catalytic activity and stability. The existence of OER active sites based on NiFe and NiFeP has been revealed by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical characterization in a three-electrode cell configuration in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. NiFe-PBA and NiFeP-PBA were assembled at the anode side of an AEMWE, resulting in an excellent electrochemical performance both in terms of current density at 2.0 V using 1 M KOH (1.21 A cm- 2) and durability, outperforming the benchmark catalyst.

The particle size and shape can be affected by stabilizer and radiation conditions. When the stabilizer was sucrose and the radiation dose was 30 kGy, well-dispersed and uniform PB nanoparticles were obtained, which are 100-200 nm in diameter.

In order to balance the N2 selectivity of SCR and the catalytic oxidation of dioxins, the catalysts with suitable redox properties and acidity need to be designed. Herein, we synthesized Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-derived CeCoOx oxides for the simultaneous removal of NOx and o-DCB by a co-precipitation method. The crystallization rate of PBA was slowed down by the addition of Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which increased the oxides size, enhanced the crystallinity of oxides and the uniformity of the surface elements distribution. These structural effects enhanced the low-temperature redox performance of the catalysts, and thus improved o-DCB conversion and CO2 selectivity. Furthermore, the PBA structure was coated by introducing TiO2, which improved the amounts of medium-acids and the mobility of oxygen species, thus increasing the mid-and high-temperature SCR performance and N2 selectivity. In addition, the H2O resistance and stability of the catalysts were enhanced due to the protective effect of the TiO2 coating on the PBA core. The optimized CeCoOx-PVP@TiO2 catalyst exhibited stable bifunctional removal efficiencies for NOx and o-DCB, with 90% NOx conversion and 92% o-DCB conversion at 300 celcius. The possible reaction mechanisms for NH3-SCR and the catalytic oxidation of o-DCB over the CeCoOx-PVP@TiO2 catalyst were proposed based on in situ DRIFTS experiments. This work provides an efficient strategy to design advanced catalysts for the elimination of dioxins and NOx.																			1385-8947	1873-3212				NOV 15	2023	476								146390	10.1016/j.cej.2023.146390	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2023.146390		OCT 2023											WOS:001096464800001

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are widely regarded as potential cathode materials for AIBs because of their high working potential and stable 3D framework. However, the low capacity of PBAs (approximate to 60 mAh g-1 in the existing reported works) hinders their further development. Herein, the ion insertion is first proposed to double the capacity of PBAs by unlocking the inert-site. Using NH4+-rich copper hexacyanoferrate as a representative, trace amounts of induced ion in the electrolyte can change the electronic states of atoms at the inert site to achieve much higher capacity. What's more, the construction of NH4+-rich high-entropy Prussian blue (N-HEPBA) further facilitates structural stability. N-HEPBA unlocked by corresponding induced ions can exhibit an impressive specific capacity (129 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), which is the highest and approximately twice that of reported PBAs for aqueous AIBs. Meanwhile, it delivers excellent cycling stability with nearly 100% capacity retention achieved over 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1. This innovative unlocking method can provide an effective way to obtain high-capacity PBAs in AIBs, thus promoting the development of large-scale energy storage. The ion insertion strategy is reported to double the capacity of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) by unlocking the inert sites for aqueous ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs). It can achieve the highest specific capacity compared with the reported PBAs cathode materials for aqueous AIBs. The simple approach makes the large-scale application feasible and facilitates the development of AIBs. image					zhao, yuanxin/KDO-9377-2024; Fu, Lei/AAB-1026-2020; Ding, Yiran/JVP-2305-2024; Lan, Haihui/KVY-4486-2024	Long, Juncai/0009-0007-6342-597X; Lan, Haihui/0009-0006-1380-1466													1616-301X	1616-3028				JUL	2024	34	29								10.1002/adfm.202400598	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202400598		FEB 2024											WOS:001177973100001

Nevertheless, the synthesis-induced crystal deficiencies in the framework of PB/PBAs greatly degrade their sodium energy properties, which challenges the potential practicability. Herein, we demonstrate an effective strategy to regulate the PB crystallinity with advanced sodium energy by tuning the synthesis medium. A favorable agent of sodium polyacrylate is screened out as the reaction mediator, which creates a strong coordinating and highly viscous environment to produce high-crystalline PB (HC-PB). Remarkably, the HC-PB harvests an elevated capacity of 140 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, superb rate capability (105 mAh g-1 at 30 C), and prominent capacity retention of 94.6 % over 1000 cycles at 10 C. The combination of in situ mechanistic and kinetic analyses reveals the rooting reasons for the performance enhancement. This study opens up a prospective and feasible medium-mediated pathway to accelerate the development of PB/PBAs toward sodium chemistry and beyond.

J	Ohara, E; Soejima, T; Ito, S				Ohara, Ei; Soejima, Tetsuro; Ito, Seishiro			Removal of low concentration Cs(I) from water using Prussian blue	INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA												Many kinds of laboratory-scale synthesized Prussian blue-based materials (PBs) have been investigated as removal agents of radioactive Cs+ via the adsorption of Cs+ in the crystal lattice of PBs. The removal ability is canonically demonstrated at high Cs+ concentrations, such as ppm order. However, the actual efflux of radioactive Cs+ after nuclear accidents in the environment is ppb level by dilution. We investigate the Cs+ removal ability of commercially available PB-based compounds at low Cs(+ )concentration below ppm order. Cs+ cations are rapidly removed using the PBs in a few minutes in water below 500 ppb Cs+ concentrations. Na+ cations in the crystal lattices of a used PB are released to water during the removal process. However, the released amount of Na+ is low compared with the adsorbed amount of Cs+, which indicates that Cs+ cations are removed by concerted two adsorption mechanisms: one is simple adsorption to the vacancy pores, and the other is ion-exchange between Cs(+ )and Na+. The rapid Cs+ removal is also observed on PBs in artificial seawater, whereas the Cs+ removal ability of zeolites as different types of Cs+ adsorbents disappears under the same removal condition.

However, the interstitial water in its crystal structure and its poor electronic conductivity limits its performance in practical sodium-ion batteries. Here, acid-assisted ball milling synthesis was employed as a versatile method for the production of surface-modified Prussian blue. With (CH3COO)(2)Fe being used as the raw material, the Prussian blue produced using ball milling synthesis was modified by the carboxyl functional group on its surface, which resulted in lower interstitial water content and enhanced electrochemical cycling performance. In addition, ball milling synthesis provided the as-prepared Prussian blue with a large surface area, improving its electrochemical rate performance. When used as the cathode of sodium-ion batteries, as-prepared Prussian blue delivered a specific capacity of 145.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and 113.7 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, maintaining 54.5% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1 C (1 C = 170 mA g(-1)). Furthermore, a solid-state sodium-ion battery was mounted, with as-prepared Prussian blue being employed as the cathode and Na metal as the anode, which delivered a high specific capacity of 128.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. The present study put forward an effective solution to overcome the limitations of Prussian blue for its commercial application.																				2079-4991				APR	2022	12	8							1290	10.3390/nano12081290	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano12081290								35457998					WOS:000785184300001

Herein, tri-metallic NiCoFe selenide catalyst backed up by carbon fiber paper (CFP) was synthesized by a facile selenization of NiCoFe Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) for OER in alkaline solutions. The NiCoFe-Se/CFP inherited the porous nanostructure of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) precursors prepared by rapid cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition. Benefiting from the 3D hierarchical porous structure, optimized elec-tronic structure of NiCoFe selenides and high conductivity, the synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits out-standing catalytic activity to the corresponding mono-metallic or bi-metallic selenides. Specifically, the NiCoFe-Se/CFP electrode demands an overpotential of 221 mV to attain the 10 mA cm-2 current density in 1.0 M KOH solution and a low Tafel slope of 38.6 mV dec-1. The prepared catalyst also displays good stability and durability. These findings prove a feasible strategy to further improve the catalytic activities of non-precious metal based OER electrocatalysts by the cooperation of structure design and chemical component modification.

The presented report demonstrates the feasibility of using different types of cations, including general transition-metal ions, p region elements in the periodic table, lanthanide elements, and overlooked cations such as Al3+ and Mo3+ to bUild unique PBAs. A systematic study of the different types of PBAs is provided in terms of physical and chemical features by means of transition electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure. Diverse PBAs can be synthesized with different morphologies. The [Ni(CN)(4)](2-)-based PBAs mainly exhibited layered products owing to their 4-fold-coordinated anions. The 6-fold-coordinated anion-based PBAs displayed cubic or distorted cubic crystal structures following the same method of ion arrangements with conventional [Fe(CN)(6)](2)(-/)(3-)-based PBAs. Furthermore, bonding conditions are greatly affected by the introduced cations.

Complete characterization of the resulting system has been performed, which has allowed the determination of the preservation of the chemical identity of both materials during the electrodeposition and the establishment of a clear interface between them. The magnetic behavior of the bilayer can be explained in terms of an exchange-spring magnet.

Design and Synthesis of Concentration Gradient Prussian Blue Analogues	CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN												A synthetic route to mixed composition particles based on different Prussian blue analogues containing a gradient in either the divalent metal or the hexacyanometalate components is explored. Synthetic conditions and combinations of components that favor kinetically trapping the gradient structures are identified, and these are contrasted with cases for which gradients in composition are harder to achieve. By an exploration of several combinations, the relative rate of precipitation of the PBA components is shown to be the crucial determinant for achieving control over the gradient synthesis, a parameter that is complicated by differing crystallization mechanisms within the PBA family. For one combination, cobalt hexacyanoferrate with nickel hexacyanoferrate, a complete series of particles is demonstrated, including particles with differing divalent metal ion gradients, core particles with a gradient shell, and particles with discrete core and shell components separated by a gradient. The structural characteristics of the gradient heterostructures are compared to the individual single phases and to more standard core-shell particles.

Plasma treatment is a helpful way to preserve the uniformity of metal sites in the open framework of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with highly active OER activity. Herein, we integrate the notable ORR performance of N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNT) with oxygen-plasma activated NiFe PBA (O-PBA), which serves as an active OER catalyst, to realize the bifunctionality of the oxygen conversion reaction. Integrating N-CNT with O-NiFe PBA frameworks provides the individual active sites for ORR and OER with a stable performance. OER performance of O-PBA/N-CNT exhibited an overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), outperforming the commercial RuO2 due to the activated metal site of O-PBA anchored in conductive N-CNT. Even after the plasma treatment, the N-CNT still had its electrocatalytic ability to improve the ORR performance, and the structure of NiFe PBA was still maintained. The combined benefits of dual active electrocatalytic sites of O-PBA/N-CNT produced a low potential gap at the value of 0.83 V in the OER/ORR polarization curve, which also exhibited stable charge-discharge performance for 45 h with a negligible potential gap of 0.70 V in RZAB application. This study presents the exploration of producing a facile synthesis of a dual active oxygen transformation electrocatalyst by utilizing the combination of surface engineering between surface doping and plasma activation.

J	Phadke, S; Mysyk, R; Anouti, M				Phadke, Satyajit; Mysyk, Roman; Anouti, Meriem			Effect of cation (Li<SUP>+</SUP>, Na<SUP>+</SUP>, K<SUP>+</SUP>, Rb<SUP>+</SUP>, Cs<SUP>+</SUP>) in aqueous electrolyte on the electrochemical redox of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY												Prussian blue analogue (PBA) material is a promising cathode for applications in Na-ion and K-ion batteries which can support high c-rates for charge and discharge. In this study, the material of composition [(K2CuFeII)-Fe-II(CN)(6)] was synthesized and its structural and electrochemical redox behavior was investigated with 5 different alkali insertion cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+). Galvanostatic measurements indicate that the redox potential strongly depends on the ionic radius of the inserted cation. The redox potential varies by similar to 400 mV between using Li+ (0.79 angstrom) or Cs+ (1.73 angstrom) in the electrolyte. The underlying modification of the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potential in PBA is proposed to be due to the weakening of the Fe-C bond in the material. This hypothesis is supported by XRD measurements which reveal that the lattice parameter of the de-intercalated host structure follows the same trend of monotonic increase with the cation size. The relatively minor volume changes accompanying the redox (1.2%-2.4%) allow the PBA to accommodate differently sized cations, although the structural hindrances are quite pronounced at high c-rates for the larger ones (Rb+ and Cs+). Cycle aging studies indicate that the minimum capacity fade rate is observed in case of K+ and Rb+ containing electrolyte. The peak intensity corresponding to the [220] crystallographic plane varies depending on the state of charge of PBA, since this plane contains the insertion cations. Owing to the sensitivity of the redox potential to the insertion cation coupled with the observed fast ion-exchange ability, the PBA material may find additional analytical applications such as ion sensing or filtration devices.

Herein, well-aligned mesoporous CoFe2O4 thin film is first developed from surface epitaxial growth of oriented CoFe-based Prussian blue analogue thin film (CoFe-PBA thin film) for efficient electrocatalytic OER. CoFe-PBA thin film with preferred [100] orientation is first prepared on the substrate surface by employing liquid phase epitaxial method without any structure-directing surfactants. After thermal pyrolysis, such CoFe-PBA thin film was transformed into well-aligned mesoporous CoFe2O4 thin film. Interestingly, the self-support CoFe3O4 thin film electrode with the mass loading of 1.6 mg cm-2 delivers an oxygen evolution current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 266 mV and exhibits durable stability in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The remarkable and stable catalytic performance of the CoFe2O4 thin film can be mainly owing to the mesoporous structure of CoFe2O4, efficient charge/electron transfer, the numerous exposed active sites, and the well-structured configuration of the electrode. Hence, this work provides an effective paradigm for preparing binder-free, self-support, and low-cost spinel oxide electrocatalyst for efficient OER derived from surface epitaxial growth of oriented PBA thin film.

This report shows how such a reaction led, unexpectedly, to the direct formation of PBA nanoparticles, the layered hydroxide serving as a metal-ion reservoir. The lamellar structure of the starting LSH collapses and copper-iron PBA nanoparticles were obtained as well-defined cubic structures stacked in layers. In addition to structural and magnetic characterization, the reaction mechanism was investigated by Fe-57 Mossbauer spectrometry and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy.

Herein, we have creatively utilized a Prussian blue analogue as a structure template of the anodic catalyst and improved its catalyst capacity by adjusting its electronic structure. The nickel-based Prussian blue analogue/Ni foam (NiFe-PBA/NF) exhibits excellent performance for methanol (MeOH) oxidation and achieves almost 94.1% FE of formic acid at a high current density of 500 mA cm-2. Apart from formic acid, NiFe-PBA/NF also has good catalytic ability for ethanol, glycerol, glucose, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). In short, this work has developed a promising class of catalysts for biomass valorization. A Prussian blue analogue was chosen as an anode catalyst to catalyze biomass valorization assisted by the HER. NiFe-PBA can achieve FEs of the corresponding value-added products over 60% and even up to almost 100% for some of them.

The obtained Mn-Fe oxides retained the nanocubic morphology of the PBA precursor, and a mesoporous structure was acquired as a result of gas molecule release during the pyrolysis process. Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the asprepared catalysts was tested, and among the bimetallic oxides, the catalyst that had a crystal structure similar to cubic bixbyite Ma(1.2)Fe(0.8)O(3) (space group: la-3) with low crystallinity exhibited the most advanced OER activity. An overpotential of only 245 mV was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope value was only 38 mV dec(-1). The excellent OER activity is likely due to the hollow porous morphology of the samples, the synergistic effect of Mn and Fe, the defect-rich low crystallinity of the catalyst, and the cubic Mn1.2Fe0.8O3 structure (space group: la-3), which has an intrinsic activity superior to that of spinet Ma(1)(.)(8)Fe(1)(.)(2)O(4).

Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) have been extensively studied using traditional ensemble methods, which only provide averaged information. Investigating PBNPs at a single entity level is paramount for correlating the electrochemical activities to particle structures and will shed light on the major factors governing the catalyst activity of these nanoparticles. Here we report on using plasmonic electrochemical microscopy (PEM) to study the electrochemistry of PBNPs at the individual nanoparticle level. First, two types of PBNPs were synthesized; type I synthesized with double precursors method and type II synthesized with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) assisted single precursor method. Second, both PBNPs types were compared on their electrochemical reduction to form Prussian white, and the effect from the different particle structures was investigated. Type I PBNPs provided better PEM sensitivity and were used to study the catalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Progressively decreasing plasmonic signals with respect to increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration were observed, demonstrating the capability of sensing hydrogen peroxide at a single nanoparticle level utilizing this optical imaging technique.

The enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the inter-connected porous structure and large amount of mesopores of FeMnO3 nanocubes and Mn2O3 nanotubes, which effectively improved structure stability, reduced the diffusion length of lithium ions and electrons, increased the diffusion coefficient of Li+ ion throughout the electrode, and buffered volume expansion during the Li+ insertion/extraction processes. These results indicate that the porous FeMnO3 nanocubes/Mn2O3 nanotubes hybrids can be a promising anode material for high-performance LIBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we present a zinc ion secondary battery, comprising a metallic zinc anode, a bio-ionic liquid-water electrolyte, and a nanostructured prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathode. Both the Zn anode and the PBA cathode exhibit good compatibility with the bio-ionic liquid-water electrolyte, which enables the electrochemical deposition/dissolution of zinc at the zinc anode, and reversible insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions at the PBA cathode. The cell exhibits a well-defined discharge voltage plateau of similar to 1.1 V with a specific capacity of about 120 mAh g(-1) at a current of 10 mA g(-1) (similar to 0.1 C). The Zn anode shows great reversibility, and dendrite-free Zn deposits were obtained after 100 deposition/dissolution cycles. The integration of an environmentally friendly PBA cathode, a nontoxic and low-cost Zn anode, and a biodegradable ionic liquid-water electrolyte provides new perspective to develop rechargeable zinc ion batteries for various applications in electric energy storage.					刘, 振/AAT-7674-2020														1944-8244	1944-8252				MAY 18	2016	8	19					12158	12164		10.1021/acsami.6b01592	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b01592								27119430					WOS:000376330800030

Composite with carbon materials is an effective solution to alleviate this problem. However, this is typically achieved through simple physical mixing or encapsulation, which relies heavily on the compatibility between carbon and PB, often resulting in composites that are neither stable nor uniform. Herein, we have developed a facile strategy that utilizes microwave radiation to anchor PB onto the surface of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) functionalized graphene oxide (GO-PVP) through stable, uniform covalent bonds via the amide groups in PVP, in order to obtain an excellent composite material with Prussian blue and carbon materials for sodium-ion batteries. The as-prepared composite materials exhibit lower content of crystallization water and higher crystal integrity, delivering a high initial specific capacity of 165.2 mAh g- 1 at 1 C rate and maintaining a capacity of 120.1 mAh g- 1 after 500 cycles. This composite approach offers novel insights into the creation of uniform and stable PB/carbon materials as the cathode of sodium-ion batteries.

However, the PB materials usually exhibit limited rate capacity and poor cycling performance, preventing their development and practical application. In this work, PB doped with nickel ions via a modified coprecipitation method was explored to improve the rate capacity and cycling performance of PIBs, and the effect of Ni doping on the materials' performance was systematically studied. The optimal sample, 5% Ni-doped PB, delivered an enhanced discharge capacity of up to 135 mAh g(-1), compared to 120 mAh g(-1) with nondoped PB. Our optimal sample also displayed excellent cycling performance with 83.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles (0.1 A g(-1)) and declining just 0.0059% per cycle from 150 to 300 cycles. The discharge capacity at the high-voltage plateau increased from similar to 40 up to 53 mAh g-1, offering a higher energy density for PIBs. On the basis of the characterization results, we ascribe the improved performance to the activation of nickel ions during the Fe2+C6/Fe3+C6 redox reaction.

It is based on the inhibitory effect of His on nanocubes consisting of cobalt-containing Prussian Blue analog (CoFe NCbs), which have a strong oxidation effect on thiamine (THI) in the presence of NaOH. THI is nonfluorescent but the oxidized form (thiochrome; ThC) has a strong blue fluorescence, with excitation/emission maxima at 370/445 nm. His inhibits the oxidation effect of the CoFe NCbs due to the strong interaction between its imidazole side chain and the amino groups of the CoFe NCbs. This method is fast and has good sensitivity and selectivity. The lower detection limit is 14.3 nM of His, the linear range extends from 0.05 to 2.5 mu M, and the relative standard deviation is calculated to be 1.5%. The method was successfully employed to quantify His in spiked serum samples.					zhang, qifang/H-5691-2013	Yao, Zhixia/0000-0002-6313-7878													0026-3672	1436-5073				JAN 3	2020	187	1							93	10.1007/s00604-019-3930-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00604-019-3930-7								31900676					WOS:000513132200002

Prussian Blue Analogue Framework Hosts for Li-S Batteries	ACS ENERGY LETTERS												Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries hold promise for next-generation energy storage due to their high theoretical energy density (similar to 2600 Wh kg-1). However, practical use is hindered by capacity loss from the polysulfide shuttle effect and poor energy efficiency due to slow kinetics. To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel sulfur host material featuring highly porous concave nanocubes derived from a Prussian blue analogue. By controlling the annealing conditions, we achieved a high surface area (up to 248 m2 g-1), which enhances polysulfide adsorption, thereby reducing sulfur dissolution and minimizing the loss of cathode capacity during cycling. Operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that this material also provides a synergistic catalytic effect, lowering polarization/overpotentials within Li-S cells. The optimized material enables an extended battery life with high sulfur loading, a low E/S ratio, and excellent capacity retention over long-term cycles, demonstrating its potential to improve Li-S battery performance.

J	Cheng, HY; Liu, YN; Wang, DX; Liu, Y; Guo, BK				Cheng, Hongyu; Liu, Yi-Nuo; Wang, Dongxiao; Liu, Yang; Guo, Bingkun			Ball-milling synthesis of low-water and phase-stable Prussian blue for sodium-ion batteries	SOLID STATE IONICS												Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and ease of preparation, are among the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, most syntheses are conducted in aqueous solutions using co-precipitation methods, and the large lattice gaps in PBAs make it challenging to effectively control interstitial water content. Interstitial water within the structure of PBAs has been a primary cause of structural instability, performance degradation, and a major barrier to their widespread application. Herein, the incorporation of large-radius ions (K+, + , Ba2+, 2+ , Ca2+, 2+ , La3+) 3+ ) into the structure of iron-based Prussian Blue via ball milling and its impact on the structure and properties of the material are investigated. The ions (Ba2+, 2+ , Ca2+, 2+ , La3+) 3+ ) readily react with (C2O4)2- 2 O 4 ) 2- during the synthesis process to form oxalate impurities. Nevertheless, through the solvent-free ball milling method, K+ + ions were successfully incorporated into the bulk structure of the material, resulting in the synthesis of Na0.32K1.53Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.98 center dot square 0.02 center dot 0.82H2O 0.32 K 1.53 Fe[Fe(CN) 6 ] 0.98 center dot square 0.02 center dot 0.82H 2 O (NaK-PB) with minimal water content. Benefiting from the enhanced structural stability of the material, NaK-PB retained a reversible capacity of 91.4 mAh g- 1 in 500 cycles at 0.1C, with a capacity retention rate 64% higher than that of material without K+ + doping. This work presents a new strategy for reducing interstitial water content in PBAs and aids in advancing the commercial application of solvent-free ball milling synthesis for PBAs.

The CoS2@NiS2 composite as a high-performance surpercapacitor electrode has been demonstrated. It exhibits very high specific capacitance value of 1731.2 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), excellent rate performance of 83.5% retention at 10 A g(-1) and cycle performance with 87.1% retention after 5000 cycles together with distinguished coulombic efficiency of around 100%. Kinetic analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results reveal the related mechanism. Herein, prussian blue analogue (PBA) as central core with cubic skeleton displays some great advantages, (1) it can provide more efficient electron conduction path to reduce the resistance of composite, (2) it can effectively prevent the agglomeration of electroactive Ni(OH)(2) as well as sulfurized CoS2@NiS2 composite, (3) it can reduce ion diffusion pathway with mesoporous structure and enlarged surface area, greatly improving cycle stability. Such synthetic strategy opens up a new avenue for the effective construction of core-shell structure based on PBA basement for promising supercapacitor application.

However, there are a lot of water molecules and vacancies in PBAs materials, which greatly reduces the storage sites of sodium ions. Furthermore, transition metal ions in the metal organic framework are easy to dissolve during the cycles, resulting in limited sodium storage capacity and poor cycle stability of PBAs cathode materials. In recent years, a variety of PBAs modification technologies have been developed to improve their sodium storage performance.

Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues are up-and-coming cathodes for SIBs due to their environmental friendliness, open framework, and facile preparation process. However, PB synthesized through traditional methods shows several vacancies and structural defects, which results in structure collapse and inferior cycling performance. In this work, an ionic liquid is introduced into the PB structure (denoted as IL-PB), which greatly reduces the nucleation rate. Thus, IL-PB delivers a high specific capacity of 134 mAh g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) and stable cycling performance with a capacity retention of 77.3% at 100 mA g(-1) after 500 cycles. The good property originates from the fewer vacancies and coordinated water in IL-PB materials. The reversible transformation mechanism of the IL-PB materials was further revealed by in situ characterizations. The introduction of ionic liquid provides an idea for the preparation of high-quality PB materials.

The proportion of Prussian blue nanoparticles used in the resin is chosen to deliver a significant photothermal effect providing a heating above the volume phase transition temperature of the final nanocomposite hydrogels; while, giving only a limited effect on light scattering during the 3D printing process.

Carbon matrix composites derived from metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are a new kind of EWs absorbing material with great application prospect. However, obtaining efficient absorbent with low filling rates and wide absorption bands remains a challenge. Here, we designed one-dimensional rough, and porous N-doped graphene fibers (N-GFs) that were assembled from two-dimensional graphene sheets with surfaces modified using a Fe-based Prussian blue analog (PBA) derivative. The rough porous structure optimized impedance matching characteristics of the absorber by introducing air gaps while the PBA particles improved N-GF electromagnetic parameters of N-GFs, increasing EWs absorption. The results showed optimal EWs absorption in the synthesized Fe-based PBA/N-GEs after annealing at 600 degrees C. At a filling rate of 10 wt%, the EWs absorption bandwidth could reach 8.19 GHz when the matching thickness was 2.1 mm; this covers most of the X radar frequency band and the entire Ku radar frequency band. The Fe-based PBA/N-GFs have a special microstructure and excellent EWs absorption properties, which provide inspiration for further exploration of graphene-based absorbing materials.

While nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) with low energy density can exhibit great cycling stability due to the electrochemical inertness of Ni. Herein, we have developed a series of cobalt nickel hexacyanoferrate (CoNiHCF) via a facile cryogenically controlled co-precipitation method. We explored the Co/ Ni molar ratio and synthesis temperature on the effects of the specific capacitance in detail. As supercapacitor cathode, the Co0.7Ni0.3HCF with the Co/Ni molar ratio of 0.7:0.3 synthesized at 0 degrees C can exhibit a high specific capacitance of 406 F g-1 at 1 A center dot g- 1 with capacitance retention of 81.89 % after 5000 cycles. The exceptional electrochemical performance is ascribed to the upgraded conductivity resulting from the coexistence of bimetallic components, the low particle size caused by the moderate introduction of Ni, the low interstitial water content, and the synergistic effect between Co and Ni. Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) of Co0.7Ni0.3HCF//Co0.7Ni0.3HCF can provide a high energy density of 72.96 W h kg-1 and 40.96 W h kg-1 at specific powers of 2876 W kg-1 and 28,577 W kg-1, respectively with a capacitance retention of 74.83 % after 4000 cycles.					chen, yingying/ABA-6955-2020														0925-8388	1873-4669				JUL 15	2024	992								174606	10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.174606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.174606		APR 2024											WOS:001217281100001

However, the advancement of high-performance AAIBs is hindered by their limited capacity and significant capacity degradation, primarily due to inadequate redox-active sites and insufficient structural stability. To address this issue, this work employed tannic acid (TA) etching and cation exchange to synthesize Mg-substituted dual-walled Mn-PBA nanocubes (MgMn-PBA DWNCs), demonstrating their exceptional capability for Al3+ storage. This unique dual-walled structure can expose abundant active sites and mitigates frequent volume changes during cycling. Besides, Mg-substituted effectively stabilizes the crystal framework and promotes the ionic diffusivity. The results show that MgMn-PBA DWNCs exhibit excellent rate performance and cycle stability, achieving a reversible capacity of 74 mAh g- 1 at 4 A g- 1. Ex-situ characterization and DFT simulation confirm that the superior Al3+ storage mechanism of MgMn-PBA DWNCs can be attributed to the highly reversible redox reactions of transition metals, effectively enhanced structural stability, and significantly improved Al3+ ionic diffusivity. Furthermore, a full battery comprising alpha-MoO3// MgMn-PBA DWNCs demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, maintaining a capacity of 78.6 mAh g- 1 over 2000 cycles at 1 A g- 1, corresponding to approximately 72.1 % capacity retention. This study offers a promising approach for the advancement of rechargeable AAIBs.					wang, qisen/JKR-1041-2023; zhu, yuanmin/AAF-6339-2019	Peng, Ning/0000-0002-6645-2005													1385-8947	1873-3212				NOV 15	2024	500								157204	10.1016/j.cej.2024.157204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.157204		OCT 2024											WOS:001348525300001

What to do to effectively promote vascular endothelial cell response and immune cell reprogramming is the key to diabetic skin healing. However, contemporary therapies cannot simultaneously coordinate the promotion of vascular endothelial cells and macrophage polarization, which leads to an increased rate of disability in patients with chronic diabetes. Therefore, we developed a method of repair composed of self-assembling Prussian blue nanoenzymes, which achieved synergistic support for the immune microenvironment, and also contributed to macrophage polarization in the tissue regeneration cycle, and enhanced vascular endothelial cell activity. The template hydrothermal synthesis PB-Zr nanoplatform was prepared and locally applied to wounds to accelerate wound healing through the synergistic effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PB-Zr significantly normalized the wound microenvironment, thereby inhibiting ROS production and inflammatory response, which may be because it inhibited the M1 polarization of macrophages in a rat model of wound. PB-Zr treatment significantly promoted the activity of vascular endothelial cells, which better promoted the growth and regeneration of other tissues in the body. The results confirmed the disease microenvironment of PB-Zr-mediated wound therapy and indicated its application in other inflammation-related diseases.

Dwayne			Synthesis of Bidimensional Prussian Blue Analogue Using an Inverted Langmuir-Schaefer Method	LANGMUIR												One of the aspects of modern materials science that has been captivating scientific interest for the past decade is low-dimensional systems. This stems from the fact that the physical, chemical, and biological properties of such systems are often vastly different from their bulk counterparts. Additionally, low-dimensionality structures frequently serve as a convenient platform for device applications. However, such materials are typically constructed from building blocks that are inherently three-dimensional, and so, from a morphological point of view, these can still be categorized as bulk powders or crystals. To push the boundaries of reduced dimensionality, we synthesized truly two-dimensional films of Prussian blue analogues (mixed valence tetracyanides) by combining an air-water interface reaction and a novel inverted Langmuir-Schaefer technique. The methodology introduced in this study offers control and tailoring over the Prussian blue analogues' film characteristics, which is an important step toward their incorporation into tangible applications. Standard isotherms were collected as a function of the initial reactant volume, and a number of characterization techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were performed on films transferred on various substrates. The results indicated a collection of single-crystalline and polycrystalline flakes possessing different thicknesses and having a structural coherence length of 11 +/- 3 nm.

In this paper, FeO/CoO hollow nanocages coated with a N-doped carbon layer (FCO@NC) was prepared using Fe-Co-based Prussian blue analogs (PBA) as a precursor. During the synthesis, dopamine was the carbon and nitrogen source. The reducing atmosphere was assured via NH3/Ar, which regulated the vacancies in the structure of FCO@NC as well as increased its conductivity. When used as anode materials for LIBs, the FCO@NC nanocages deliver a high reversible capacity of 774.89 mAh center dot g-1 at 0.3 A center dot g-1 after 200 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 80.4% and 426.76 mAh center dot g-1 after 500 cycles at a high current density of 1 A center dot g-1. It is demonstrated that the hollow nanocage structure can effectively enhance the cycle stability, and the heat treatment in NH3/Ar atmosphere contributes to the oxygen vacancy content of the electrode materials, further facilitating its conductivity and electrochemical performance.

We used supercritical carbon dioxide extraction apparatus to pressurize the samples for 10 MPa, 20 MPa, and 42 MPa for 5 h. X-ray powder diffraction data show the single-phase of the sample at different pressures with a NaCl-type face-centered cubic structure. Trimetal Prussian blue analogs Cu0.71Mn0.79[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot 7.3H(2)O include both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions among different metal ions and exhibit novel mixed magnetic property. Hydrostatic pressure may be a powerful tool for development of new functional magnets. Spontaneous magnetization in the field cooled (FC) magnetization above 10 MPa approaches a value three times larger than that at 1 atm, and the zero field cooled (ZFC) magnetization is also extremely sensitive to pressure. The results show that pressure can simultaneously enhance the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in this material. The Weiss constant decreases gradually with pressure increasing from 10 to 42 MPa, due to pressure-induced electron transfer from Mn2+/Cu2+ to Fe3+. [GRAPHICS] .

NiFe-based Prussian blue analogue nanopolygons hybridized with functionalized glyoxal polymer as a voltammetric platform for the determination of amisulpride in biological samples	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												A novel voltammetric platform based on pencil graphite electrode (PGE) modification has been proposed, containing bimetallic (NiFe) Prussian blue analogue nanopolygons decorated with electro-polymerized glyoxal polymer nanocomposites (p-DPG NCs@NiFe PBA Ns/PGE). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and square wave voltammetry (SWV) were utilized to investigate the electrochemical performance of the proposed sensor. The analytical response of p-DPG NCs@NiFe PBA Ns/PGE was evaluated through the quantity of amisulpride (AMS), one of the most common antipsychotic drugs. Under the optimized experimental and instrumental conditions, the method showed linearity over the range from 0.5 to 15 x 10(-8) mol L-1 with a good correlation coefficient (R = 0.9995) and a low detection limit (LOD) reached, 1.5 nmol L-1, with excellent relative standard deviation for human plasma and urine samples. The interference effect of some potentially interfering substances was negligible, and the sensing platform demonstrated an outstanding reproducibility, stability, and reusability. As a first trial, the proposed electrode aimed to shed light on the AMS oxidation mechanism, where the oxidation mechanism was monitored and elucidated using the FTIR technique. It was also found that the prepared p-DPG NCs@NiFe PBA Ns/PGE platform had promising applications for the simultaneous determination of AMS in the presence of some co-administered COVID-19 drugs, which could be attributed to the large active surface area, and high conductivity of bimetallic nanopolygons.

Its redox behavior has been studied in magnesium containing electrolytes. Both K+ ions deintercalated from the structure upon oxidation and contamination with Na+ ions coming from the separator were found to interfere in the electrochemical response. In the absence of alkaline ions, pre-oxidized manganese hexacianoferrate showed reversible magnesium intercalation, and the process has been studied by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The location of Mg2+ ions in the crystal structure was not possible with the available experimental data. Still, density functional theory simulations indicated that the most favorable position for Mg2+ intercalation is at 32f sites (considering a pseudo cubic F m-3m phase), which are located between 8c and Mn sites.

The morphology and the structure of Fe3O4/Co3[Co(CN)(6)](2) composites were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS, VSM. The results showed that the removal rate of RhB (10 mg/L) reached 99.5% in 40 min in the 0.4Fe(3)O(4)/Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) (200 mg/L) + PMS (50 mg/L) system with a pseudo first-order degradation rate constant (k) of 0.121 min(-1) , which is nearly 2.16 times of that (0.0561 min(-1)) in the Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) + PMS system and 18.9 times of that (0.0064 min(-1)) in the Fe3O4 + PMS system. The observed synergistic catalysis between Fe3O4 and Co3[Co(CN)6]2 in Fe3O4/Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) enhanced the degradation of RhB. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and quenching experiment indicated that SO4 center dot- and (OH)-O-center dot played important roles in the degradation process of RhB. A synergistic catalytic mechanism of PMS activation by Fe3O4/Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2), which mainly involves the enhanced Co2+/Co3+ cycle by Fe2+ donated electrons, was proposed.

Test measurements of Cs-137 concentrations in seawater using Cu-CF agreed with the results obtained by using a conventional coprecipitation method that employed ammonium phosphomolybdate (within the counting error of the detector).

Local structure of a switchable dielectric Prussian blue analogue	CRYSTENGCOMM												The Prussian blue (cyanide-bridged, ordered double perovskite) analogue potassium imidazolium hexacyanoferrate, (C3N2H5)(2)K[Fe(CN)(6)], contains imidazolium cations encapsulated within a metal-cyanide framework. These are free to rotate in the intermediate-and high-temperature phases, but freeze into fixed orientations in the low-temperature phase. The phase transition between intermediate-and lowtemperature phases thus causes a substantial change in this material's dielectric constant. However, the detailed cation dynamics, and in particular how they differ between intermediate-and high-temperature phases, remain unclear. We report here total neutron scattering measurements on a perdeuterated sample of this material. Reverse Monte Carlo modelling reveals that the intermediate-temperature phase is associated with a stiffening of the metal-cyanide framework compared to either of the other phases. This shows that the dynamics responsible for the phase transitions involve competition between the energetic penalty for bending the metal-cyanide links and the benefit of host-guest hydrogen bonding.

Progress in vacancy chemistry has enabled advances in many technological applications, but creating new type of vacancies in existing material system remains a big challenge. We show here that ionized nitrogen plasma can break bonds of iron-carbon-nitrogen-nickel units in nickel-iron Prussian blue analogues, forming unconventional carbon-nitrogen vacancies. We study oxygen evolution reaction on the carbon-nitrogen vacancy-mediated Prussian blue analogues, which exhibit a low overpotential of 283 millivolts at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkali, far exceeding that of original Prussian blue analogues and previously reported oxygen evolution catalysts with vacancies. We ascribe this enhancement to the in-situ generated nickel-iron oxy(hydroxide) active layer during oxygen evolution reaction, where the Fe leaching was significantly suppressed by the unconventional carbon-nitrogen vacancies. This work opens up opportunities for producing vacancy defects in nanomaterials for broad applications.

Mn-based PBA (MnHCF) shows high redox potential but considerable capacity degradation. By contrast, Fe-based PBA (FeHCF) exhibits good cyclic stability but relatively low redox potential. The different electrochemical performance is mainly due to different coordinated states, i.e., Fe-C & EQUIV;N-Fe in FeHCF and Fe-C & EQUIV;N-Mn in MnHCF. In this work, those two coordinated states are incorporated to construct Fe/Mn coexistent PBA (FeMnHCF), which shows not only high average discharge voltage (3.82 V vs. K+/K), but also excellent cyclic stability (the capacity can maintain 90 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles) in commonly used ester electrolyte. The results demonstrate that the coexistent coordinated structure not only improves the redox potential of N-coordinated Fe, but also increases the capacity contribution at high voltage (above 3.5 V). Furthermore, the coexistent structure can effectively inhibit the dissolution of transition metal (TM) elements and maintain structural integrity during K+ insertion/extraction, contributing to excellent cyclic stability. This work provides a promising strategy to design stable high-voltage PBA cathode materials.

Nevertheless, crystal water (approximate to 10 wt%) in PBAs from aqueous synthesis environments can bring significant side effects in real SIBs, especially for calendar life and high temperature storage performance. Therefore, it is of great importance to eliminate crystal water in PBAs for future commercial applications. Herein, a facile heat-treatment method is reported in order to remove water from Fe-based PBAs. Although the heat-treated sample can be easily rehydrated in air, it still exhibits a stable cycling performance over 2000 times under controlled charge cut-off voltage. In situ synchrotron high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction demonstrates that the as-prepared sample is maintained at a new trigonal phase after dehydration. Moreover, the redox reaction of low-spin Fe2+/Fe3+ is activated and the high-temperature storage performance of as-prepared sample is significantly improved after removal of water.

Electrochemical Analysis of the Mechanism of Potassium-Ion Insertion into K-rich Prussian Blue Materials	CHEMELECTROCHEM												The electrochemical insertion patterns of potassium-rich Prussian blue (PB) materials with different compositions and particle sizes were systematically compared, which allows us to deduce correlations between the influence of particle morphology and material structure on the potassium-ion insertion mechanisms in aqueous solutions. Although structural analysis indicates that no first-order phase transitions occur for nanosized K-rich Prussian blue particles upon potassium-ion (de)insertion, the electrochemical data (galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, small- and large-amplitude potential step experiments) suggest other outcomes related to the two-phase insertion mechanism for all explored PB samples. However, even in a case whereby the phase transformation is not accompanied by abrupt changes in the crystal structure, the two-phase mechanism dominates all of the essential practical characteristics of performance of this cathode material, such as hysteresis (overpotential) between charge and discharge steps and the measured diffusivities of potassium-ions during charge and discharge. The formalism presented herein provides a basis for quantitatively assessing ion insertion and deinsertion parameters unique to PB analogues.

Hidden diversity of vacancy networks in Prussian blue analogues	NATURE												Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are a diverse family of microporous inorganic solids, known for their gas storage ability(1), metal-ion immobilization(2), proton conduction(3), and stimuli-dependent magnetic(4,5), electronic(6) and optical(7) properties. This family of materials includes the double-metal cyanide catalysts(8,9) and the hexacyanoferrate/ hexacyanomanganate battery materials(10,11). Central to the various physical properties of PBAs is their ability to reversibly transport mass, a process enabled by structural vacancies. Conventionally presumed to be random(12,13), vacancy arrangements are crucial because they control micropore-network characteristics, and hence the diffusivity and adsorption profiles(14,15). The long-standing obstacle to characterizing the vacancy networks of PBAs is the inaccessibility of single crystals(16). Here we report the growth of single crystals of various PBAs and the measurement and interpretation of their X-ray diffuse scattering patterns. We identify a diversity of non-random vacancy arrangements that is hidden from conventional crystallographic powder analysis. Moreover, we explain this unexpected phase complexity in terms of a simple microscopic model that is based on local rules of electroneutrality and centrosymmetry. The hidden phase boundaries that emerge demarcate vacancynetwork polymorphs with very different micropore characteristics. Our results establish a foundation for correlated defect engineering in PBAs as a means of controlling storage capacity, anisotropy and transport efficiency.

To solve these two problems simultaneously, we report a new strategy that combines the advantages of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with the conductive characteristic of polypyrrole (ppy) to construct FeCoNi PBA-S-ppy composite. The open metal centers in PBAs act as Lewis acid sites with good affinity to the negatively charged polysulfide anions, while the open framework structure allows effective storage of sulfur and confinement of lithium polysulfides (LiPS). Herein, the polysulfide redox reaction mechanism and kinetics are revealed by using in situ X-ray diffraction. The adsorption ability test and electrochemical performance assessment together with density functional theory calculations reveal that the FeCoNi PBA can achieve enhanced LiPS absorption ability and better cycling performance than the FeNi and FeCo PBAs. This can be attributed to the multi-metal synergistic adsorption toward LiPS within FeCoNi PBA, which can act as an effective chemical-anchor to capture LiPS. After combining the FeCoNi PBA with ppy, a physical barrier formed, and the improvement of the conductivity resulted in remarkable electrochemical performance. We believe that PBAs can play a beneficial role in guaranteeing more stable and efficient Li-S batteries.																			1385-8947	1873-3212				SEP 15	2021	420		3						130518	10.1016/j.cej.2021.130518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.130518		JUN 2021											WOS:000663705900004
J	Yuan, TF; Gao, X; Kang, SF; Cui, LF				Yuan, Tiefeng; Gao, Xin; Kang, Shifei; Cui, Lifeng			Rational combination of Inverted-Pyramid structured Nickel-based Prussian blue with porous 3D carbon as high-performance sodium-ion batteries cathode	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Metal based Prussian blue composite materials with heterogeneous structures possess substantial potential for enhancing both ionic and charge transfer processes, ultimately expediting electrochemical reaction kinetics for various battery devices. However, the limited bonding between carbon materials and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and the uncontrolled nucleation rate of metal component resulted in limited specific capacity and cyclic stability. Herein, we introduced a novel approach for the in-situ synthesis of Ni-PBA with an inverted-pyramid structure on a three-dimensional ultra-thin carbon frames (3DUC) substrate via a hydrothermal method. The inverted pyramid structure fits tightly with the 3DUC during nucleation to form a one-piece stable structure. This integration effectively curbs aggregation and hasty nucleation tendencies of NiPBA. Furthermore, the abundant voids and interconnected networks within the 3DUC structure significantly reduce ion diffusion path lengths, thereby lowering the Na diffusion barrier and enhancing the material's capacitance contribution rate. Consequently, this cathode material exhibits commendable initial capacity (125.2 mAh/g at 50 mA g(-1)) and exceptional long-term cycling stability (with a capacity retention of 89.06 % after 900 cycles at 50 mA g(-1)). These findings hold significant promise for advancing the commercial viability of metal-PBA based electrodes by rational heterogeneous structure design.

However, during the synthesis, crystal defects such as vacancies and the incorporation of crystal water can lead to issues such as diminished capacity and suboptimal cycling stability. In the current study, a Y-tube assisted coprecipitation method was used to synthesize iron-based Prussian blue analogues, and the optimized feed flow rate during synthesis contributed to the successful preparation of the material with a formula of Na1.56Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.900.10 center dot 2.42H2O, representing a low-defect cathode material. This approach cleverly utilizes the Y-tube component to enhance the micro-mixing of materials in the co-precipitation reaction, featuring simplicity, low cost, user-friendly, and the ability to be used in continuous production. Electrochemical performance tests show that the sample retains 69.8% of its capacity after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5C (1C = 140 mA g-1) and delivers a capacity of 71.9 mA h g-1 at a high rate of 10C.

Rational design of a CoFe-prussian blue analogue-derived three-dimensional ternary nanocatalyst with efficient ORR/OER catalytic performance for Zn-air batteries	MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY												To effectively alleviate the aggregation of catalytic active sites, the rational design and simple preparation of a nanocatalyst with an ideal configuration plays a decisive role. Herein, a CoFe-prussian blue analogue (PBA) decorated with composite carbon/nitrogen sources (C/Ns) is prepared as the precursor to synthesize a threedimensional (3D) ternary nanocomposite by a two-step calcination method. In this 3D nanocomposite, the 0D CoFe alloy nanoparticles derived from the PBA are mostly embedded in 1D N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and partially loaded on 2D N-doped carbon nanosheets. Accordingly, the aggregation of alloy nanoparticles is greatly alleviated while a 3D nanostructure with large specific surface area, porosity, good electron transport properties and exposed active sites can be formed. The alloy nanoparticles are excellent electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions, while also facilitating the formation of conductive NCNTs. Density Functional Theory calculations confirm the synergy between the Fe, N doped carbon and (110) crystal plane of the CoFe alloy that accounts for the electrocatalytic activity. The assembled Zn-air batteries show an open circuit voltage of 1.510 V, power density of 196.1 mW cm-2 and an operational durability of 300 h. Moreover, the assembled all-solid-state batteries display the potential for practical applications. This work demonstrates that the configuration of the electrocatalyst can significantly affect its catalytic performance.

Moreover, the capacity retention of CoFePBA@PDA after 100 cycles is 14.3% higher than that of the two comparison samples. In addition, the reversible structure of CoFePBA@PDA without forming a new phase was verified by in situ X-ray diffraction.

However, the strong electrostatic interactions and delayed charge compensation between high-charge-density aluminum ions and the fixed lattice in conventional cathodes impede the development of high-performance AAIBs. To address this issue, this work introduces, for the first time, high-entropy Prussian blue analogs (HEPBAs) as cathodes in AAIBs with unique lattice tolerance and efficient multipath electron transfer. Benefiting from the intrinsic long-range disorder and robust lattice strain field, HEPBAs enable the manifestation of the lattice respiration effect and minimize lattice volume changes, thereby achieving one of the best long-term stabilities (91.2% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1) in AAIBs. Additionally, the interaction between the diverse metal atoms generates a broadened d-band and reduced degeneracy compared with conventional Prussian blue and its analogs (PBAs), which enhances the electron transfer efficiency with one of the best rate performance (79.2 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1) in AAIBs. Furthermore, exceptional element selectivity in HEPBAs with unique cocktail effect can facile tune electrochemical behavior. Overall, the newly developed HEPBAs with a high-entropy effect exhibit promising solutions for advancing AAIBs and multivalent-ion batteries. To overcome the inherent incompatibility between high-charge-density Al3+ and conventional cathode materials in AAIBs, this work proposes a novel family of high-entropy Prussian blue analogs (HEPBAs) with a unique lattice "respiration" characteristic and efficient multipath electron transfer. The optimized HEPBAs achieve one of the best long-term stabilities in AAIBs (91.2% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1). image					HU, Yuxiang/S-1235-2019; Li, Hui/IXD-4563-2023; Ma, Tianyi/ABE-8342-2021; zhao, yiqi/HDL-8861-2022	Du, Kai/0000-0002-7273-5212; Ma, Tianyi/0000-0002-1042-8700; hu, yuxiang/0000-0001-5641-0357													0935-9648	1521-4095				JUL	2024	36	30								10.1002/adma.202404172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.202404172		MAY 2024						38734973					WOS:001228975900001

The crystalline structure, morphology and textural properties of the Co-Fe PBAs@rGO nanocomposites were characterized. The catalytic performance of the nanocomposites was evaluated by PMS activation, with Levofloxacin Hydrochloride (LVF) as the target contaminant. Synergistic interactions between the Co-Fe PBAs and rGO prevented the aggregation of the Co-Fe PBAs nanoparticles, which resulted in enhanced degradation efficiencies. The influence of several critical parameters was investigated, including the reaction temperature, PMS and Co-Fe PBAs@rGO catalyst concentrations, solution pH and salt content. LVF degradation was favored at higher catalyst and PMS concentrations, high temperatures, and in neutral or weak acidic solutions. Sulphate radicals were the dominant active species in the Co-Fe PBAs@rGO/PMS system. In addition, the Co-Fe PBAs@rGO exhibited no significant decrease in LVF degradation efficiency following five catalytic cycles. Thus, the as-prepared Co-Fe PBAs@rGO nanocomposite catalyst might be applied to the removal of hard-to-degrade organics owing to its high catalytic ability to activate PMS, as well as its good reusability and recyclability.

But they often suffer from metal-iondissolution induced structural degradation, resulting in fast capacity fade and shortcycle life. Long-term cycling of PBAs has recently been successfully demonstratedby using highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes, while the stabilizationmechanism of PBAs in the electrolytes has remained unclear. In this work, theexperimental and molecular modeling evidence indicates that the hydrophobiclayer on the PBA/electrolyte interface and the highly restricted network in theconcentrated aqueous electrolyte both play critical roles in suppressing metal-iondissolution of PBAs. That explains why the NH4+full battery consisting of a PBAcathode can be stably cycled over 4000 cycles with 72.3% capacity retention (8C).The molecular-level understanding of the stabilization mechanism establishes aguiding principle for the stable storage of diverse ions in PBAs, including but notlimited to NH4+,Li+,Na+,Mg2+, etc					Xu, Kui/AAW-5535-2021; Kong, Huabin/AGH-7335-2022; lu, derong/HCH-1625-2022	Chen, Hongwei/0000-0002-1401-9680; Sun, Wenlu/0000-0002-6770-4809; LU, DERONG/0000-0002-7028-3558; zhang, Junyu/0000-0002-9983-2311													2380-8195					MAY 13	2022	7	5					1672	1678		10.1021/acsenergylett.2c00292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.2c00292													WOS:000802291300012

Prussian blue (PB) is a potential photothermal agent in bacteria obliteration. The electron density of cyanide bonds (-C N-) in PB plays a decisive role on its PTT performance. Meanwhile, recent reports indicated that encapsulating PB shell on lanthanide nanomaterials core could effectively enhance its photothermal efficiency. Hence, a series of lanthanide ions, including erbium (Er3+), dysprosium (Dy3+), thulium (Tm3+), ytterbium (Yb3+), doped PB nanocubes were fabricated by a simple doping method due to the differences between lanthanide and iron on changing electron density of cyanide bond. And the Yb3+ doped PB (PB-Yb) has the best PTT performance of all nanocubes. Structure analyzing results indicate that 9% Fe (Fe2+ or Fe3+) were replaced by Yb3+ in PB-Yb, which could raise its electron density to improve its PTT performance. And the antibacterial test also verified the conclusion. All above results proved that doping proper lanthanide ions into PB is a simple and effective way to improve its photothermal performance.																			1387-7003	1879-0259				APR	2020	114								107821	10.1016/j.inoche.2020.107821	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.inoche.2020.107821													WOS:000521513500015

However, the hydrated zinc ions have strong electrostatic force with the host material, causing the low output voltage and poor reversibility. Thus, exploiting suitable cathode materials with high voltage, specific capacity, and stable cycling performance is still a challenge. Recently, the development of cathode materials mainly focuses on manganese-based, vanadium-based, organic, and Prussian blue analog (PBAs) materials. Among these cathodes' materials, PBAs have attracted great attention for AZIBs owing to their high working voltage, tunable chemical composition and microstructure, open 3D frameworks, low cost, and ease of synthesis. To record the recent rapid development PBAs materials toward high-performance AZIBs, we provide fundamental insights into the structure characteristics and synthesis control of PBAs and present an overview of recent developments of PBAs as promising cathodes for AZIBs. Finally, the key challenges and future opportunities in this rapidly developing field are also presented in this review. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Influence of the Substrate on the Performance of a Co-Prussian Blue Catalyst towards the Water Oxidation under Mild Conditions	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Efforts in developing water oxidation reaction (WOR) catalysts mainly focus on Earth-abundant elements with high stability and efficiency. However, the behavior of these materials may vary depending on the electrochemical substrate with which they interact. Understanding the interaction between the catalyst and the substrate can provide valuable insights to advance the design of highly efficient water-splitting devices. In this context, we investigated the influence of different electrochemical substrates on the performance of cobalt-Prussian blue analog (Co-PBA) in WOR under neutral conditions (pH = 7). The results highlight the role of substrate type, including conductive glass (fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)), 3D-printed electrodes (3DPE), and Ni-foam, on the electrocatalytic efficiency of Co-PBA. Two methods of Co-PBA synthesis (electrodeposition and drop casting) were employed to understand their effects on morphology, electrochemical properties, and performance in WOR. The results revealed that the substrate and preparation method of Co-PBA can affect the electrochemical behavior, demonstrating differences in electrocatalytic activity, stability, and charge transfer.

The comparison of SPB NCPs (having Fe-CN-Ag bonds) with the conventionally used Prussian blue nanoscale coordination polymers (PB NCPs, having Fe-CN-Fe bonds) was investigated in terms of their physical and therapeutic properties. It was observed that both PB and SPB NCPs have similar physical dimensions, crystalline phase and optical properties. Both these NCPs showed robust photothermal effect by heat generation (hyperthermia) upon exposure to red laser light. However, among the two, only SPB NCP showed oxidase-like activity by generating H2O2 in aqueous medium, presumably due to its silver content. In vitro antibacterial studies revealed that the SPB NCPs, but not PB NCPs, show inherent toxicity towards bacteria with an IC50 value close to 2.5 mu g/ml. It can be inferred that this toxicity is oxidative in nature, as a result of the oxidase-like behaviour shown by SPB NCPs. Furthermore, light activation resulted in substantial additional antibacterial effect (photothermal toxicity) in bacterial cells treated with SPB NCPs. In comparison, marginal additional photothermal toxicity was observed in PB NCP-treated bacteria. Thus, we conclude that the combination of dual modality oxidative and photothermal toxicities demonstrated by SPB NCPs, but not by control PB NCPs, makes the former promising antibacterial agents at low dosages.

However, the large ionic radius and high mass of Na+ hamper its kinetics in the case of diffusion-controlled mechanisms in conventional electrodes. In this study, a unique intercalation pseudocapacitance has been demonstrated in low-vacancy copper hexacyanoferrate, achieving outstanding rate capability. The minimization of the [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancy enables unhindered diffusion pathways for Na+ and little structural change during the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox reaction, eliminating solid-state diffusion limits. Moreover, the Cu+/Cu2+ couple is unexpectedly activated, realizing a record capacity for copper hexacyanoferrate. A capacity of 86 mAh g(-1) is obtained at 1 C, of which 50 % is maintained under 100 C and 70 % is achieved at 0 degrees C. Such intercalation pseudocapacitance might shed light on exploiting high-rate electrodes among Prussian blue analogs for advanced sodium-ion batteries.

The literature sometime suggests that the soluble form of PB should be used to treat thallium poisoning, instead of the FDA approved insoluble form of PB. The literature debate is further complicated by the lack of fundamental characterization data such as critical quality attributes (CQAs) that clearly define the analog forms. The purpose of this study is to compare, the binding capacity of soluble and insoluble PB analogs with the same CQAs (particle size/distribution and water content). Water content and particle size/particle distribution were determined by TGA, and solid-state laser diffraction particle sizing. Thallium binding studies were conducted at physiological pH to determine the maximal binding capacity (MBC) at equilibrium. Multiple linear regression and principal component analysis was also used for multivariate data analysis. Results indicate that insoluble and soluble analogs, with similar quality attributes, have nearly identical, MBC binding capacities of (441.5 mg/ g) for insoluble vs soluble (458.4 mg/g). However, when both analog forms with different CQAs such as water, particle size were compared, results indicated significantly higher or lower thallium binding levels. In conclusion, it is essential that the FDA approved iron form with well-defined CQAs is used to treat thallium poisoning and radioactive thallium metal contamination for consistent therapeutic outcomes.

Microneedle-based transdermal electrochemical biosensors based on Prussian blue-gold nanohybrid modified screen-printed electrodes	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS												We report on the fabrication of a microneedle-based electrochemical biosensor for use in transdermal biosensing, which includes a screen-printed electrode containing a Prussian blue-gold nanohybrid as the working electrode. The Prussian blue gold nanohybrid is made from polyethylenime (PEI)- mediated simultaneous synthesis of Prussian blue (PBNP) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP), which forms a PBNP-AuNP nanohybrid with a remarkable change in the Prussian blue character. PEI-protected polycrystalline PBNPs can be synthesized in acidic media from the single precursor potassium ferricyanide [K3Fe(CN)(6)] at 60 degrees C. Since PEI also enables the controlled formation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of formaldehyde, nanohybrids containing PBNPs and AuNPs may be prepared. Two different methods of PEI mediated synthesis of AuNP in the presence of PBNP were considered. In Method 1, AuNP and PBNP were made independently and mixed together in an appropriate ratio. In Method 2, PBNPs were made first, followed by PEI- and formaldehyde-mediated reduction of gold cations in the presence of PBNP. PBNP-AuNPs display a remarkable change in Prussian blue behavior such that the absorption maxima of PBNP-AuNPs made through Method 1 tend to increase at 670 nm as a function of gold concentration as compared with the control; the reverse was observed when PBNP-AuNPs were made through Method 2. As made PBNPs and PBNP-AuNPs made through Method 1 display excellent catalytic activity toward both reduction and oxidation of hydrogen peroxide based on peroxidase mimetic activity. In addition, the as-synthesized PBNPs displayed superparamagnetic behavior that can be manipulated in the presence of AuNPs. The results from peroxidase mimetic activity, chemiluminescence, cyclic voltammetry, and amperometry showed suitable analytical performance of the as-made PBNP-AuNP nanohybrid for biomedical applications.

In this proof-of-concept study, a pyridinium ligand coordinated pentacyanoferrate(II) chromophore is used to construct a cyanide-based CoFe extended bulk framework, in which the iron photosensitizer units are connected to cobalt water oxidation catalytic sites through cyanide linkers. The iron-sensitized photoanode exhibits exceptional stability for at least 5 h at pH 7 and features its photosensitizing ability with an incident photon-to-current conversion capacity up to 500 nm with nanosecond scale excited state lifetime. Ultrafast transient absorption and computational studies reveal that iron and cobalt sites mutually support each other for charge separation via short bridging cyanide groups and for injection to the semiconductor in our proof-of-concept photoelectrochemical device. The reorganization of the excited states due to the mixing of electronic states of metal-based orbitals subsequently tailor the electron transfer cascade during the photoelectrochemical process. This breakthrough in chromophore-catalyst assemblies will spark interest in dye-sensitization with robust bulk systems for photoconversion applications.

The last few years have witnessed increasing interest in the nanoscale Kirkendall effect as a versatile route to fabricate hollow/porous nanostructures. The transformation of Cu-Co Prussian blue analogue (CuCo-PBA) and FeFe-PBA nanocubes into CuO/Co3O4 and Fe2O3 nanoframes is based on two types of nanoscale Kirkendall effect, which are related to solid-solid interfacial oxidation and solid-gas interfacial reaction, respectively. Both CuO/Co3O4 and Fe2O3 nanoframe electrodes exhibit high reversible discharge capacity, good rate performance and long cycling stability. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled by using CuO/Co3O4 as a cathode and Fe2O3 as an anode, respectively. The ASC can be operated in a wide potential range of 1.4 V with a large specific capacity of 181.8 F g(-1), a high energy density of 48.77 W h kg(-1) (at 751.2 W kg(-1)), an outstanding power density of 3657.8 W kg(-1) (at 32.9 W h kg(-1)) and a good capacity retention (73.68%) after 6000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles, together with excellent flexibility. The ASC in series can power a LED and work stably under water conditions, delivering excellent practicability.

However, the deposition of fully crystallized cathode thin film generally requires high temperature synthesis or annealing, incompatible with microfabrication processes of integrated Si devices. In this work, a low temperature deposition process of a porous Prussian blue-based cathode on Si wafers is reported. The active material is electrodeposited under aqueous conditions using a pulsed deposition protocol on a porous dendritic metallic current collector that ensures good electronic conductivity of the composite. The high voltage cathodes exhibit a huge areal capacity of approximate to 650 mu Ah cm(-2) and are able to withstand more than 2000 cycles at 0.25 mA cm(-2) rate. The application of these electrode composites with porous Sn based alloying anodes is also demonstrated for the first time in full cell configuration, with high areal energy of 3.1 J cm(-2) and more than 95% reversible capacity. This outstanding performance can be attributed to uniform deposition of Prussian blue materials on conductive matrix, which maintains electronic conductivity while simultaneously providing mechanical integrity to the electrode. This finding opens new horizons in the monolithic integration of energy storage components compatible with the semiconductor industry for self-powered microsystems.

Efficient, robust and inexpensive nanoparticles (nanoenzymes) capable of scavenging/detoxifying ROS even in harsh environments are attracting strong interest. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), a prominent group of metalorganic nanoparticles (NPs) with the same cyanometalate structure as the traditional and commonly used Prussian blue (PB), have long been envisaged to mimic enzyme activities for ROS scavenging. However, their biological toxicity, especially potential effects on living beings during practical application, has not yet been fully investigated. Here we reveal the enzyme-like activity of FeCo-PBA NPs, and for the first time investigate the effects of FeCo-PBA on cell viability and growth. We elucidate the effect of the nanoenzyme on the ethanol-production efficacy of a typical model organism, the engineered industrial strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We further demonstrate that FeCo-PBA NPs have almost no cytotoxicity on the cells over a broad dosage range (0-100 mu g mL(-1)), while clearly boosting the yeast fermentation efficiency by mitigating oxidative stress. Atmospheric pressure cold plasma (APCP) pretreatment is used as a multifunctional environmental stress produced by the plasma reactive species. While the plasma enhances the cellular uptake of NPs, FeCo-PBA NPs protect the cells from the oxidative stress induced by both the plasma and the fermentation processes. This synergistic effect leads to higher secondary metabolite yields and energy production. Collectively, this study confirms the positive effects of PBA nanoparticles in living cells through ROS scavenging, thus potentially opening new ways to control the cellular machinery in future nano-biotechnology and nano-biomedical applications.

The system of CuMnFe-PBAs@MWCNTs coexists with both large and small clusters. CuMnFe-PBAs clusters have an average particle size of 28 nm, and some of the smaller particles are adsorbed on the surface of MWCNTs. Surprisingly, the magnitude of magnetization increases linearly with decreasing temperature. When above the Curie temperature, the magnitude of magnetization is significantly greater than that of PBAs without being modified. This phenomenon can be attributed to magnetostatic interactions between ultra-fine magnetic nanoparticles adsorbed on the surface of MWCNTs. Using the Monte Carlo method, we simulated the magnetostatic interaction of cylindrical adsorbed particles, and the simulation results are almost identical to those observed experimentally. The results indicate that 0.089 CuMnFe-PBAs clusters per 1 nm(2) can be adsorbed onto the surface area of MWCNTs. We demonstrate that MWCNTs adsorbing magnetic particles exhibit magnetic behavior, and suggest a method for producing ultrafine materials. It also introduces a new method of calculating the adsorption efficiency of carbon nanotubes, offering theoretical guidance for future research on nanomaterials with enhanced adsorption efficiency.

With a novel approach, a series of porous manganese-iron PB (MnPB) colloids, which are shown to be efficient scavengers for reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide, are prepared. In vitro cellular experiments confirm the capability of the nanozyme to protect cells from ROS attack. In vivo, the administration of MnPB nanozyme through gavage at a dosage of 10 mg kg-1 per day for three doses in total potently ameliorates the pathological symptoms of acute UC in a murine model, resulting in mitigated inflammatory responses and improved viability rate. Significantly, the nanozyme produced at a large scale can be achieved at an unprecedented yield weighting approximate to 11 g per batch of reaction, demonstrating comparable anti-ROS activities and treatment efficacy to its small-scale counterpart. This work represents the first demonstration of the scale-up preparation of PB analog nanozymes for UC without compromising treatment efficacy, laying the foundation for further testing of these nanozymes on larger animals and promising clinical translation. A novel, green, and straightforward approach is developed to macroscopically produce manganese-iron Prussian blue (PB@MnPB and MnPB) analog nanozymes, yielding approximate to 11 grams of product per batch of reaction.

The common counterpart reaction for ORR and CO2RR is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water. The low-overpotential OER catalyzed by nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on CP has attracted attention for integration in energy-conversion devices. Earth-abundant and low-cost 3d transition metals have been intensively explored as OER catalysts. In this study, we have successfully prepared Fe-Co Prussian blue analog (PBA) NPs with the formulae of Fe1-xCox[Fe(CN)(6)](0.67)center dot nH(2)O and Fe1-yCoy[Co(CN)(6)](0.67).mH(2)O, and the Fe-Co PBA NPs are dispersed into water by surface modification using [Fe(CN)(6)](4-). By a simple drop-coating method, the Fe-Co PBA NPs are immobilized on CP and thermally decomposed into Fe-Co oxides at 400 degrees C. The OER overpotentials of the Fe-Co oxides are gradually decreased by increasing the Co composition ratios, and the lowest overpotential is 0.46 V vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm(2) in y = 0.6.																			0020-1693	1873-3255				MAR 1	2020	502								119345	10.1016/j.ica.2019.119345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ica.2019.119345													WOS:000510860900043

Hard-templating of Prussian blue analogues in mesoporous silica and organosilica	DALTON TRANSACTIONS												Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been constructed in chiral nematic mesoporous organosilica and silica templates. By functionalizing the surface of the mesoporous hosts with bipyridinium ligands, it was possible to construct PBAs in their interiors through hard templating. The optical properties of the composites were studied and the relationship between the circular dichroism (CD) signals and the UV-Vis absorption spectra was found through mathematical modeling. Efforts to remove the hard templates to give free-standing PBA films with high surface area and pore volume were met with limited success, but it was possible in the case of zinc/iron PBAs to obtain a highly porous PBA sponge that retained the overall morphology of the template. This work demonstrates the potential for hard templating of coordination polymers in mesoporous materials.

J	Goda, ES; Lee, S; Sohail, M; Yoon, KR				Goda, Emad S.; Lee, Seungho; Sohail, Muhammad; Yoon, Kuk Ro			Prussian blue and its analogues as advanced supercapacitor electrodes	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY												Remarkable attention has been directed to Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBA) as one of the most widely used metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) especially in the field of energy storage devices due to their fabulous features such as 3D open framework, high surface area, controllable distribution of pores and the low cost. Nevertheless, their depressed conductivity causes some insulation when being used as an electrode for supercapacitors leading to be restricted in further applications particularly the electronics. To the best of our knowledge, our review aimed primarily to give a total picture of the research that was done on utilizing PB and PBA for fabricating the electrodes of supercapacitor, studying their synthesis approaches in addition to the hybridization with other materials such as graphene, CNTs and conducting polymer. It also addresses the transformation of PB or PBA into other interesting nanostructures such as oxides, sulfides, and bicomponent of graphitic carbon nitride/metal oxides, as well. Furthermore, It exhibits various avenues for overcoming their disadvantages of bad cycle life, retention rate and not achieving the desired values of energy/power densities opening the door for enlarging the number of researches on their application as supercapacitors.

Prussian blue and its analogues (abbreviated as PB) as a cathode material for SIBs were proposed due to the similar working mechanisms with LIBs. However, the early synthesized PBs have suffered capacity fading at long cycles of charge/discharge and high C-rate. In this work, we synthesized a cage-like porous cubic structure (PB-C) via a simple single iron source precipitation method with a reheating process and acid etching. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements have shown that a high specific capacity could be maintained at a high C-rate. At 0.2 C, the specific capacity is 112 mA h g(-1), while at 10 C, the specific capacity is 97 mA h g(-1). Also, PB-C showed no obvious capacity fading at the 1000th cycle with more than 85% capacity retention. Cyclic voltammetry analysis at various scan rates proved that the nanoporous structure with a superior specific surface area carries the pseudocapacitance effect, leading to the excellent electrochemical performance. This exceptional performance discloses that the as-prepared cage-like porous PB is one of the potential candidates as a cathode material in low-cost and large-scale applications for practical SIBs.					woo, haw jiunn/R-1072-2017; Wang, Fei/B-9853-2009	Wang, Fei/0000-0003-1871-1022; WOO, HAW JIUNN/0000-0002-1126-0153; Chen, Yuncai/0000-0003-4304-9034														2574-0970				MAR 22	2022	5	4					4833	4840		10.1021/acsanm.1c04416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.1c04416													WOS:000813114800001

Herein, a potassium manganese iron copper hexacyanoferrate (KFe2/3Mn1/6Cu1/6HCF), with suppressed anionic vacancies, eliminated band gap, and low K-ion diffusion barrier, is regarded as a cathode for potassium-ion batteries. The entropy stabilization effect and robust Cu-N bond induced by the inert Cu-ion with large electronegativity boost KFe2/3Mn1/6Cu1/6HCF to exhibit great phase state stability, thus inhibiting the structural transition of monoclinic <-> cubic. Hence, KFe2/3Mn1/6Cu1/6HCF undergoes a zero-stress solid-solution reaction mechanism, where Fe and Mn serve as dual active sites for charge compensation. Consequently, KFe2/3Mn1/6Cu1/6HCF displays a high reversible capacity of 127.5 mAh<middle dot>g-1 with an energy density of 469.2 Wh<middle dot>kg-1 at 10 mA<middle dot>g-1 and superior cyclic stability with a high retention of 90.7% over 100 cycles.

J	Kim, J; Kang, J; Um, W				Kim, Jueun; Kang, Jaehyuk; Um, Wooyong			Simultaneous removal of cesium and iodate using prussian blue functionalized CoCr layered double hydroxide (PB-LDH)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Radioactive cesium and iodine have become an emerging issue because these radionuclides have high radio toxicity and solubility, and they can easily transport to the surrounding environment. Prussian blue, known as metal hexacyanoferrate compound, has a cubic face-centered structure and similar ionic size to Cs+, known to be used for Cs+ removal. In addition, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have anion exchange properties and become the promising sorbents of iodine. In this study, based on the advantages of both Prussian blue (PB) and layered double hydroxide (LDH), Prussian blue functionalized layered double hydroxide (PB-LDH) was synthesized to concurrently remove both Cs+ and IO3(- )from radioactive solutions. During the synthesis of PB-LDH, Fe(CN)(6)(4-)does not intercalate into the LDH structure, but aggregates on the LDH surface according to electrostatic force and ion-specific effects and forms the PB on the surface of LDH. The synthesized PB-LDH simultaneously removed 32 mg/g of Cs+ and 91 mg/g of IO3- from the mixed waste solutions. The main removal mechanism of Cs+ was redox coupled alkali metal ion transport to form Cs4Co4Fe3II(CN)(18) species at the surface of PB-LDH. However, IO3- was mainly removed by ion exchange with intercalated Cl- in addition to the redox effect of Co ions.

Local Structure and Dynamics in MPt(CN)6 Prussian Blue Analogues	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												We use a combination of X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) measurements, lattice dynamical calculations, and ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the local structure and dynamics in various MPt(CN)(6) Prussian blue analogues. In order to link directly the local distortions captured by the PDF with the lattice dynamics of this family, we develop and apply a new "interaction-space" PDF refinement approach. This approach yields effective harmonic force constants, from which the (experiment-derived) low-energy phonon dispersion relations can be approximated. Calculation of the corresponding Gruneisen parameters allows us to identify the key modes responsible for negative thermal expansion (NTE) as arising from correlated tilts of coordination octahedra. We compare our results against the phonon dispersion relations determined using DFT calculations, which identify the same NTE mechanism.

The SWCNT coverage on SS radically obstructs the metallic corrosion under anodic polarization and also enhances the electrolyte stability window by preventing direct contact between the metal substrate and electrolyte. Both the positive and negative materials are structurally analyzed by Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data. The Co-PBA framework structure demonstrates one-dimensional channels with similar to 5.3 and 5.1 angstrom widths along [100] and [011], respectively, whereas the layered NVO depicts an interlayer spacing of similar to 4.2 angstrom for facile Na-ion transportations. Resultantly, the high diffusion coefficients of Na-ions in Co-PBA and NVO are achieved as 1.6 x 10-13 and 2.0 x 10-11 cm2 s-1, respectively. Both Co-PBA and NVO exhibit a diffusion-controlled Faradaic charge storage mechanism, which has been demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry. The Co-PBA provides 122 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 1C rate, which is the highest reported value in aqueous medium with low-cost current collectors. The electrochemical performance testing of NaV3O8 is first described by us, explicitly for the negative electrode, and it delivers 83 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 1C. The 1.5 V silica gel-based Co-PBA//NVO full cell is fabricated with mass balancing, which shows higher cell voltage by maximizing the water splitting window. The full cell delivers a specific capacity of 141 mAh g-1 (@ 1C), an energy density of 211 Wh kg-1 (@ 250 W kg-1), a power density of 2466 W kg-1 (@ 94 Wh kg-1), and good durability (80% capacity retention @ 5C) up to 500 cycles. A 3 V/5 mAh rated prototype device is assembled, and it delivers satisfactory solar energy storage performances under 1 week of continuous operation.

This study correlates the performance of the nickel hexacyanoferrate to the dynamics of H2O in the electrolyte and the associated phase stability of the electrode. It demonstrates severe Ni dissolution in conventional diluted aqueous electrolyte (1 m ZnSO4 or 1 m Zn(TFSI)(2)), leading to structure collapse with the formation of an electrochemical inert phase. This is regarded as the descriptor for the fast decay of nickel hexacyanoferrate in diluted aqueous electrolyte. However, a well-preserved open framework for zinc storage was obtained in concentrated aqueous electrolyte (1 m Zn(TFSI)(2) + 21 m LiTFSI)-the H2O activity is highly suppressed by extensive coordination-thus, reversible capacity of 60.2 mAh g(-1) over 1600 cycles could be delivered.

A combination of inductively-coupled plasma and X-ray powder diffraction measurements suggests the hexacyanometallate vacancy fraction in this modified PBA is reduced by approximately one third under the specific conditions we explore. We infer the mechanochemically-driven incorporation of [Co(CN)(6)](3-)ions onto the initially-vacant sites, coupled with intercalation of charge-balancing K(+)ions within the PBA framework cavities.

Herein, we address this issue by anchoring phosphate ions (Pi) layer between hematite's surface and CoFe-Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) water oxidation catalyst (WOC). The PEC results revealed that the Pi interfacial layer is crucial for boosting the PEC activity of CoFe-PBA/hematite photoanode. It improves the activity by 2.9-fold at 1.23 V-RHE. The analysis of time and frequency-resolved results revealed that the synergy between the Pi layer and CoFe-PBA catalyst prolongs the photogenerated holes lifetime, reduces their charge transfer resistance, and suppresses the surface recombination. The DFT simulations suggested that the Pi interfacial layer drifts the electrostatic potential of the hematite's surface toward more negative potential and thus facilities the diffusion of the photogenerated holes toward the hematite/CoFe-PBA/electrolyte interfaces making them dynamically apposite to oxidize water on CoFe-PBA WOC.

Herein, a defective Prussian-blue (delta-PB or Fe-1.23(III)[Fe-1.12(II)(CN)(6)](0.87).delta(0.13)) on graphene composite electrocatalyst was fabricated through a facile hydrolytic precipitation process, followed by a single-step carbonization treatment at 600 degrees C (denoted as 8-PB/G-600). The resultant optimized delta-PB/G-600 exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic water splitting in alkaline media, producing lower overpotentials of 189 and 105 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Most importantly, the 8-PB/G-600 shows remarkable durability for both reactions. The remark-able electrocatalysis was attributed to the abundant active sites and high electrical conductivity with a defective nature, which not only facilitate the electrolyte flux but also maintain the structural stability of 8-PB/G-600. Additionally, the high surface area confirms the facile mass transport and prompts the gaseous release of the composite. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the preparation of PBA and their derivatives on specific substrates are still far from practical use. Herein, we propose an innovative general and scalable strategy to grow PBA coatings on any conductive substrates including Ni, Co, stainless steel, Mo, W, Ti, Ta, Ni/carbon cloth (CC), and FTO with large sizes and high curvatures through spontaneous growth or electrodeposited seeds assisted epitaxial growth in solution. The potential difference between Fe3+/Fe2+ redox pair in the solution and metal ions/metal redox pair of the metal substrate may promote the release of metal ions from the substrate and induce the spontaneous growth. As a demonstration, PBA/Ni/CC samples prepared on Ni/CC substrates with this approach were transformed into nickel iron phosphides (NiFeP/CC) via a simple phosphidation process, which show excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the unique structures and desirable chemical compositions. It only requires very low overpotentials of 260 mV to achieve 200 mA cm-2 for OER and 129 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 for HER, respectively. Furthermore, the NiFeP/CC|| NiFeP/CC couple requires a low cell voltage of 1.57 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 and shows an ultralong lifetime with no obvious degradation after electrolyzing for 300 h, which is much superior to many other reported electrocatalysts.

In this study, unlike the traditional coprecipitation method to prepare the Prussian blue analogue (PBA), PBA with a tremella-like microflower structure is first synthesized by the hydrothermal method under the synergistic effect of trisodium citrate dihydrate (TSC, Na(3)C(6)H(5)O(7)middot2H(2)O) and K-3[Co(CN)(6)], and two kinds of cobalt sulfide nanoparticles embedded in N/S-codoped carbon frameworks (namely, Co3S4@C-N/S and Co9S8@C-N/S) are successfully synthesized by a subsequent solid sulfidation process. Herein, N/S-codoped carbon frameworks improve the electronic conductivity and provide more active sites for sodium storage. As the anode material in SIBs, the Co3S4@C-N/S 1.8-based anode exhibits an excellent initial charge/discharge specific capacity of 685.3/745.2 mAh g(-1) with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 91.97% at 0.1 A g(-1) and a superior cycling performance (599.1 mAh g(-1) in the 600th cycle at 1 A g(-1) with a capacity retention of 89.4%).

Conventional cell configurations employ flammable liquid electrolytes that impose safety concerns, as well as considerable degrees of irreversible side reactions at the reactive electrode interfaces (especially against potassium metal), resulting in a rapid capacity fade. While being inherently safer, solid polymer electrolytes may present a solution to capacity losses owing to their broad electrochemical stability window.

At an elevated operating temperature of 55 degrees C, the solid-state battery achieved a superior capacity retention of 90% over 50 cycles in direct comparison to a conventional carbonate-based liquid electrolyte operated at ambient temperature with a capacity retention of only 66% over the same cycle number interval.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses show that compounds 1, 2, 5, and 6 have distorted face-centered-cubic frameworks that can be considered as superexpanded Prussian blue analogues built of two different hexacyanometallate nodes and expanded by insertion of the [Mn(salen)](+) complex, while 4 features a quasi-superexpanded Prussian blue framework because the structure is based on the hexacyano metal cluster and disordered tetracyano [Ni(CN)(4)](2-) nodes. The powder X-ray diffraction of 3 indicates that it possesses a quasi-superexpanded Prussian blue framework based on the hexacyano cluster and disordered pentacyano [Fe(CN)(5)(NO)](2-) nodes. Compound 6 is the first compound containing three 3d-3d'-M-6 cluster (4d) spin centers. Magnetic measurements reveal that the overall magnetic nature can be systematically controlled by the choice of the octahedral metal cluster and polycyanometallate nodes. H-2/N-2 adsorption and thermal stability of the compounds were investigated.																			0020-1669	1520-510X				FEB 2	2015	54	3					1082	1090		10.1021/ic502401n	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic502401n								25590572					WOS:000348887400050

Methods: A layer-by-layer method was used to synthesize polyIC-coated PBNPs (polyIC-PBNPs). PolyIC-PBNPs were stable and monodisperse, maintained the native absorbance properties of both polyIC and PBNPs and were obtained with high nanoparticle collection yield and polyIC attachment efficiencies. Results: PolyIC-PBNPs were more effective in reactivating latent HIV than free polyIC in a cell model of HIV latency. Furthermore, polyIC-PBNPs were more effective in promoting immune activation than free polyIC in CD4 and CD8 T cells. Conclusion: PBNPs function as efficient carriers of nucleic acids to directly reverse HIV latency and enhance immune activation. Plain language summaryHIV is a virus that attacks and weakens the immune system. If left untreated, HIV infection leads to AIDS. To combat this, administration of antiretroviral therapy allows HIV to be controlled, and an infected individual may live a normal life. However, there is no cure for HIV because the virus persists within hidden reservoirs of latently infected cells that remain undetected by the immune system. A cure strategy currently under investigation in the field utilizes a latency reversing agent (LRA) to reactivate latent HIV with the goal of promoting a response from the immune system. To achieve this goal, this study used a nanoparticle-based method to administer LRAs. More specifically, the authors synthesized Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) coated with the LRA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyIC), a synthetic analog of dsRNA. This study demonstrates that when administered in the form of nanoparticles, polyIC-coated PBNPs generate both enhanced reactivation of HIV and immune activation when compared with free polyIC. These results indicate a promising potential for using PBNPs to deliver LRAs such as polyIC to enhance current and future HIV cure strategies.

To address this challenge, in this study, we integrate a Prussian blue analog (PBA) shell on a pseudocapacitive material to achieve a remarkably improved capacitive performance by a solar light-induced heating effect. The capacitor material is prepared by growing a layer of nickel hexacyanoferrate nanocrystals on NiO nanotubes (NTs) via a simple anion-displacement reaction. The electrodes based on optimized PBA/NiO NTs not only exhibit an enhanced capacitance in a natural Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte but also show a remarkable overall phototo-thermal conversion efficiency. Most importantly, the local surface temperature can rapidly increase from -4.0 degrees C to 45.6 degrees C by solar-light irradiation for only 30 min. Benefitting from the highly increased local temperature, the cation storage ability is highly improved, which shows 377.8% enhancement of specific capacitance at a coulombic efficiency higher than 100%. An asymmetric supercapacitor cell assembled using PBA/NiO NTs and active carbon exhibits distinct thermally enhanced capacitance, mechanical flexibility, and outstanding cycling performance of 15,000 cycles without any capacity decay, indicating the great potential in real application for antidecay of energy storage devices in cold weather. This design paves new pathways to utilize solar light to achieve a suitable working temperature for pseudocapacitors in a low temperature environment (down to approximately -4 degrees C), thus possessing great application potentials in the field of advanced energy storage devices.					xu, jingwen/KQV-3759-2024	Song, Yan-Yan/0000-0001-5150-4784													2168-0485					SEP 6	2021	9	35					11837	11846		10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03483		AUG 2021											WOS:000695384700021

Here, we show the use of copper hexacyanoferrates (CuHCFs) as ion-conducting channels for the selective recovery of ammonium from wastewater. This model Prussian blue analogue was deposited at the surface of a cation exchange membrane (CEM) by a simple layer-by-layer precipitation method. The resulting CuHCF-CEM showed a selectivity of 5.0 +/- 0.4 for NH4+ relative to Na+ using a binary mixture of synthetic wastewater (5 mM NH4Cl, 20 mM NaCl, 0.17 mA cm(-2)), which was nearly 5 times greater than the bare CEM. The improved selectivity was attributed to the CuHCF layer wherein NH4+ could be migrated faster as well as more favorably occupied relative to Na+. The selectivity of CuHCF-CEM for NH4+ was maintained relatively high compared with that of CEM in the presence of competing cations in a real domestic wastewater sample. This proof-of-concept study shows that selective ion-conducting channels of CuHCFs can provide a means to ammonia recovery from wastewater in electro-driven membrane processes.

Although a large amount of effort has been made on material innovations, the alkali-site alternative design strategy for PBAs is still elusive. A new strategy of adding multivalent cations in the electrolyte is proposed to improve the structural stability of PBA and promote sodium ions diffusion rate. In particular, Ba2+ can insert in the PBA lattice via in-situ elec-trochemical reaction when the battery is performed in charging-discharging process. Therefore, Ba2+ acts as a "defender" to maintain the frame stability and prevent residual water from entering the lattice. By reasonably controlling the additive amount of Ba2+ in the electrolyte, the as-prepared cathode shows remarkably enhanced structural stability with a capacity retention of 96.6% after 150 cycles and delivers a capacity of 83.41 mAh g-1 even at 6 C. This work provides important insights into the development of alkaline-site substitution strategies for high-performance cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries.

J	Bonnet, R; Lenfant, S; Mazérat, S; Mallah, T; Vuillaume, D				Bonnet, Romeo; Lenfant, Stephane; Mazerat, Sandra; Mallah, Talal; Vuillaume, Dominique			Long-range electron transport in Prussian blue analog nanocrystals	NANOSCALE												We report electron transport measurements through nano-scale devices consisting of 1 to 3 Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanocrystals connected between two electrodes. We compare two types of cubic nanocrystals, (CsCoFeII)-Fe-III(15 nm) and (CsNiCrIII)-Cr-II(6 nm), deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and contacted by conducting-AFM. The measured currents show an exponential dependence with the length of the PBA nano-device (up to 45 nm), with low decay factors beta, in the range 0.11-0.18 nm(-1)and 0.25-0.34 nm(-1)for the CsCoFe and the CsNiCr nanocrystals, respectively. From the theoretical analysis of the current-voltage curve for the nano-scale device made of a single nanoparticle, we deduce that the electron transport is mediated by the localized d bands at around 0.5 eV from the electrode Fermi energy in the two cases. By comparison with previously reportedab initiocalculations, we tentatively identify the involved orbitals as the filled Fe(ii)-t(2g)d band (HOMO) for CsCoFe and the half-filled Ni(ii)-e(g)d band (SOMO) for CsNiCr. Conductance values measured for multi-nanoparticle nano-scale devices (2 and 3 nanocrystals between the electrodes) are consistent with a multi-step coherent tunneling in the off-resonance regime between adjacent PBAs, a simple model gives a strong coupling (around 0.1-0.25 eV) between the adjacent PBA nanocrystals, mediated by electrostatic interactions.

Facilitated transport of ammonia in ultra-thin Prussian Blue membranes with potential-tuned selectivity	JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE												Here we report on tunable ammonia transport through ultrathin Prussian Blue (PB) membranes facilitated with protonic carrier. Continuous gas-tight 15-50 nm Prussian Blue layers were prepared by cyclic electrodeposition on porous gold/anodic aluminum oxide supports. The membranes reveal fast ammonium transport with NH3 permeance exceeding 0.3 m3(STP) m(-2) bar(-1) h(-1), ultimate ideal NH3/H-2 selectivity attaining 40 and NH3/N-2 selectivity over 100. In mixed-gas separation thermodynamically-favored sorption leads to additional NH3/H(2 )selectivity rise to similar to 70. Facilitation of NH3 transport occurs upon its conversion to NH4+ maintaining the electroactivity of the selective layer and reversibly tuned by electrochemical framework loading. Engagement of the pmtonation step is supported with Raman spectroscopy and close values of NH3 diffusion coefficients measured in gas permeation experiments and NH4+ diffusion coefficient determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in liquid phase. The impact of water vapors partial pressure as backward protonic carrier on NH3 transport efficiency is exposed and discussed.

Single crystals suitable for magneto-optical measurements were grown starting from enantiopure chiral ligands. X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurements confirmed the 2D-layered structure of the material, its absolute configuration, and its ferrimagnetic ordered state below a critical temperature T-C of 38 K. Absorption and MChD spectra were measured between 450 and 900 nm from room temperature down to 4 K. At 4 K the electronic spectrum features spin-allowed and spin-forbidden transitions of Grin centers, spin-forbidden transitions of the Mn-II centers, and metal-to-metal charge transfer bands. The MChD spectra below the magnetic ordering temperature exhibit intense absolute configuration-dependent MChD signals. The temperature dependence of these signals closely follows the material magnetization. Under a magnetic field of 0.46 T, the most intense contribution to MChD represents 2.6% T-1 of the absorbed intensity, one of the highest values observed to date.

Because of the open framework and structural controllability, Prussian blue and its analogues (PB) are considered to be competitive cathodes of PIBs. However, the intrinsic lattice defects and poor electronic conductivity of PBs induce poor cycling performance and rate capability. Herein, we propose a polypyrrole-modified Prussian blue material (KHCF@PPy) via an in situ polymerization coating method for the first time. KHCF@PPy possesses a low defect concentration and improved electronic conductivity, and the electrode was found to exhibit 88.9 mA h g(-1) discharge capacity at SO mA g(-1), with 86.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles. At a higher current density of 1000 mA g(-1), the initial discharge capacity was 72.1 mA h g(-1), which dropped slightly to 61.8 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles. The capacity decay rate was 0.03% per cycle. Detailed characterization showed a lack of phase transition during the charge and discharge processes and determined that K ions were not completely extracted from the monoclinic structure, possibly contributing to the excellent cycling stability. This simple surface modification method represents a promising means of mitigating issues currently associated with PB-based cathodes for PIBs.

In terms of energy storage and conversion, Prussian blue-based materials have emerged as suitable candidates of growing interest for the fabrication of batteries and supercapacitors. Their outstanding electrochemical features such as fast charge-discharge rates, high capacity and prolonged cycling life make them favorable for energy storage application. Furthermore, Prussian blue and its analogues as rechargeable battery anodes can advance significantly by the precise control of their structure, morphology, and composition at the nanoscale. Their tunable structural and electronic properties enable the detection of many types of analytes with high sensitivity and specificity, and thus, they are ideal materials for the development of sensors for environmental detection, disease trend monitoring, and industrial safety. Additionally, Prussian blue-based catalysts display excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of pollutants and generation of hydrogen. Specifically, their excellent light capturing and charge separation capabilities make them stand out in photocatalytic processes, providing a sustainable option for environmental remediation and renewable energy production. Besides, Prussian blue coatings have been studied particularly for corrosion protection, forming stable and protective layers on metal surfaces, which extend the lifespan of infrastructural materials in harsh environments. Prussian blue and its analogues are highly valuable materials in healthcare fields such as imaging, drug delivery and theranostics because they are biocompatible and their further functionalization is possible. Overall, this review demonstrates that Prussian blue and related framework materials are versatile and capable of addressing many technical challenges in various fields ranging from power generation to healthcare and environmental management.

In the oxidation process, oxidization of Fe and/or Co are compensated by Na+ deintercalation. Here, we investigated the oxidization process of three Co-PBAs by means of in situ infrared absorption (IR) spectroscopy. With use of an empirical rule of the frequencies of the CN- stretching mode in ferrocyanide ([Fe-II(CN)(6)](4-)) and ferricyanide ([Fe-III(CN)(6)](3-)), the oxidation processes of Co-PBAs were determined against the Fe concentration (y) and temperature (T). We will discuss the interrelation between the oxidation processes and Fe concentration (y).

However, their practical applications still suffer from a low actual specific capacity and inferior stability owing to the imperfect crystallinity, irreversible phase transition, and low intrinsic conductivity. Herein, a surface-modification technique for vapor-phase molecular self-assembly was developed to prepare Fe-based PBAs, specifically sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (NaFeHCF), with a uniform conductive polymer protective layer of polypyrrole (PPy) on the surface, resulting in NaFeHCF@PPy. The incorporation of a PPy protective layer not only improves the electronic conductivity of NaFeHCF@PPy, but also effectively mitigates the dissolution of Fe-ions during cycling. Specifically, this advanced vapor-phase technique avoids Fe2+ oxidation and Na+ loss during liquid-phase surface modification. The NaFeHCF@PPy exhibited a remarkably enhanced cycling performance, with capacity retentions of 85.6% and 69.1% over 500 and 1000 cycles, respectively, at 200 mA/g, along with a superior rate performance up to 5 A/g (fast kinetics). Additionally, by adopting this strategy for Mn-based PBAs (NaMnHCF@PPy), we further demonstrated the universality of this method for PBA cathodes in SIBs.

Herein, a stepwise hollow cubic framework structure is first designed and a hybridized hierarchical film synthesized from single-crystal PBA nanoframes/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite is demonstrated as a binder-free ultrahigh rate sodium ion cathode. This hierarchical configuration offers improved tolerance for lattice expansion, reduced sodium ion diffusion path, enhanced electronic conductivity, and optimized redox reactions, thereby achieving the excellent rate capability, high specific capacity, and long cycle life. As expected, the developed FeHCFe nanoframes/CNTs electrode film exhibits a super high rate capacity of 149.2 mAh g(-1)at 0.1C and 35.0 mAh g(-1)at 100C. Moreover, it displays an excellent cycling stability with about 92% capacity retention at 5C after 500 cycles.

Particularly, the structural design of Prussian blue (PB) series materials with robustness and fast nucleation is even more difficult. Herein, a self-sustained-release strategy based on the slow release of metal ions from coordination ions is proposed to guide the assembly of PB crystals. The key to this strategy is the slow release by ligand, which can create ultra-low concentrations of metal ions so as to provide the possibility to realize the surface charge manipulation of PB primary colloids. By adding electrolyte or changing the polarity of the solution, the surface charge regulation of PB colloid is realized, and the PB hierarchical structures with branch fractal structure (PB-BS), octahedral fractal structure, and spherical fractal structure are effectively constructed. This work not only achieves the designability of the PB structure, but also synchronizes the functionalization during the PB assembly growth process by in situ encapsulation of the effective catalytic active component L-Ascorbic acid. As a result, the assembled PB-BS exhibits greatly enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity in styrene oxidation with the selectivity of oxidized styrene increasing from 35.6% (PB) to 80.5% (PB-BS). A self-sustained-release strategy based on the slow release of metal ions from coordination ions is proposed to guide the assembly of Prussian blue (PB) crystals. The PB hierarchical structure with branched fractal structure, octahedral fractal structure, and spherical fractal structure is effectively constructed. image					Lu, Qingyi/O-4479-2015; Zhang, Chunyan/C-7821-2017	Lu, Qingyi/0000-0002-6160-9499													1613-6810	1613-6829				OCT	2024	20	42								10.1002/smll.202402920	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202402920		JUN 2024						38864391					WOS:001244033800001

Rapid catalytic reduction of environmentally toxic azo dye pollutant by Prussian blue analogue nanocatalyst	RSC ADVANCES												The release of toxic azo dyes pollutants in the environment from different industries represents a public health concern and a serious environmental problem. Therefore, the conversion of hazardous methyl orange (MO) azo dye to environmentally benign products is a critical demand. In this work, an eco-friendly Prussian blue analogue (PBA) was synthesized and its catalytic activity toward the reduction of MO was investigated. The PBA copper(ii) hexacyanocobaltate(III) (Cu3[Co(CN)6]2) was synthesized by a facile inexpensive chemical coprecipitation method without using hazardous solvents. The nanocatalyst was characterized using XPS, Raman, FTIR spectroscopy, and XRD. The chemical reduction of MO using NaBH4 and the PBA as nanocatalyst was monitored by UV-VIS spectroscopy. Toxic MO was completely reduced in 105 s with a rate constant (k) 0.0386 s-1 using only 10 mu g of the PBA nanocatalyst. Besides the powerful catalytic activity, the nanocatalyst also showed excellent stability and recyclability for ten consecutive cycles, with no significant decrease in the catalytic performance. Therefore, the proposed PBA is a promising, stable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly nanocatalyst for the rapid elimination of hazardous azo dyes. The paper discusses the synthesis and catalytic activity of a promising, cost-effective, and stable Prussian blue analogue nanocatalyst for the rapid elimination of hazardous azo dye in industrial effluents.

P/MDCs combine the advantages of both the high specific surface area of PBA/MOF and the electronic conductivity of metal compound/carbon. Although the calcination under different atmospheres has been extensively studied, the transformation mechanism of PBA/MOF under hydrothermal conditions remains unclear. The qualitative preparation of P/MDCs in hydrothermal conditions remains a challenge. Here, we select PBA to construct a machine-learning model and measure its hydrothermal phase diagram. The architecture-activity relationship of substances among nine parameters was analyzed for the hydrothermal phase transformation of PBA. Excitingly, we established a universal qualitative model to accurately fabricate 31 PBA derivates. Additionally, we performed three-dimensional reconstructed transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ X-ray powder diffraction, and theoretical calculation to analyze the advantages of hydrothermal derivatives in the oxygen evolution reaction and clarify their reaction mechanisms. We uncover the unified principles of the hydrothermal phase transformation of PBA, and we expect to guide the design for a wide range of composites.

J	Shibata, T; Fukuzumi, Y; Moritomo, Y				Shibata, Takayuki; Fukuzumi, Yuya; Moritomo, Yutaka			Thermal efficiency of a thermocell made of Prussian blue analogues	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Recently, it was reported that a thermocell can convert temperature into electric energy by using the difference in the thermal coefficient (alpha = dV/dT) of the redox potential (V) between the cathode and anode materials. Among battery materials, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising materials for thermocell, because alpha changes from approximately -0.3 mV/K in NaxMn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.83) 3.5 H2O (NMF83) to approximately 1.3 mV/K in NaxCo[Fe(CN)(6)](0.9)2,9H(2)O (NCF90). In this work, we systematically investigated the thermal efficiency (eta) of the NMF83/NCF90 thermocell relative to the difference (Delta T) between low (T-L = 282 K) and high (T-H = 292-338 K) temperatures. We found that the thermal efficiency (eta) increased proportionally with Delta T. The linear increase in. is ascribed to the linear increase in the cell voltage (V-cell) and the charge (Q(NCF90)) extracted from NCF90. Moreover, eta reached 3.19% at Delta T = 56 K, which corresponds to 19% of the Carnot efficiency (eta(carnot) = 17.0%). We further confirmed that the magnitude of Q(NCF90) is quantitatively reproduced by the slopes of the discharge curves of NMF83 and NCF90.

One prime example includes using light in molecular cyanide-bridged [FeCo] bimetallic Prussian blue analogues, where it switches the system between the electron-transferred metastable state and the system's ground state. If this process is coupled to a ferroelectric-type phase transition, the generation and disappearance of macroscopic polarization, entirely under light control, become possible. In this research, we successfully executed a nonpolar-to-polar phase transition in a trinuclear cyanide-bridged [Fe2Co] complex crystal via directional electron transfer. Intriguingly, by exposing the crystal to the wavelength of light & horbar;785 nm & horbar;without any electric field & horbar;we can drive this ferroelectric phase transition to completely depolarize the crystal, during which a measurable electric current response can be detected.

Herein, through modulation of the metal composition in the precursors, the core@shell structure Prussian blue analog-derived NiCo@C, CoFe@C, NiFe@C, and NiCoFe@C are obtained with excellent EM wave absorption performance. As for NiCoFe@C, ascribed to the coupling effect of the dual magnetic alloy, a minimum reflection loss (RL) of -47.6 dB and an effective absorption bandwidthof 5.83 GHz are realized, which cover the whole Ku-band. Meanwhile, four absorbers display the lower corrosion current density (10(-4)-10(-6) A cm(-2)) and larger polarization resistance (10(4)-10(6) omega) under acid, neutral, and alkaline corrosion conditions over uninterrupted 30 days. Furthermore, due to the spatial barrier effect and the passivation effect of the graphitic carbon shell , the continuous salt spray test has little effect on RL performance and inconspicuously changes the surface morphologies of coating, demonstrating its excellent bifunctional performance. This work lays the foundation for the development of metal-organic frameworks-derived materials with both anticorrosion and EM wave absorption performance.

XRD results show that the samples conform to the Fm-3 m space group, and the lattice constants are 10.230 & Aring; ([KCoFePBA](NP)) and 10.225 & Aring; ([KCoFePBA](IIP)), respectively. According to the results of M & ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy, due to the induction of infrared light during the preparation process, part of the electrons are transferred from Co2+ to Fe3+, the paramagnetic Fe3+ (S = 1/2)-CN-Co2+ (S = 3/2) changes to the diamagnetic Fe2+ (S = 0)-CN-Co3+ (S = 0) by charge transfer. The magnetization measurement shows that the magnetization of [KCoFePBA](IIP) is significantly less than that of [KCoFePBA](NP). At 300 K, the theoretical magnetic moments of [KCoFePBA](NP) and [KCoFePBA](IIP) are 4.60 mu (B) and 4.37 mu (B), respectively. The difference in magnetism can be attributed to the charge transfer caused by infrared irradiation during the preparation process.

Here, we present an approach to overcome this challenge by constructing chemical long-range disorder (LRD) in PBAs, involving maintaining inherent local coordination while introducing disorder over long-range spatial dimensions. Order control is achieved by introducing a large-sized lattice to disrupt the original lattice growth during synthesis. Unlike traditional monocrystalline particles, the abundant grain boundaries in the obtained LRD structure create significant potential fluctuations, generating additional electric fields that enhance ion transport. Furthermore, the short lattice coherence length reduces interaction between the framework and K+. These factors collectively contribute to the improved electrochemical activity of LRD PBAs during K+ storage.

Many hexacyanoferrate materials have shown excellent properties and are some of the most promising sodium- and potassium-ion cathode materials in both aqueous and organic electrolytes. However, there is a distinct lack of candidate PBA materials that operate at low potentials, as their characteristic crystalline framework shows instability. In this article, we characterize the structure and electrochemical behavior of manganese hexacyanochromate, which exhibits reversible sodium insertion at -0.86 V vs standard hydrogen electrode (1.84 V vs Na+/Na) while maintaining the characteristic PBA cubic structure. This is the lowest redox potential of reported PBA materials and shows fast kinetics in a high-voltage water-in-salt electrolyte. Further reduction in potential in an organic electrolyte shows decomposition of the crystalline structure.					; Pasta, Mauro/B-8164-2012	Wheeler, Samuel/0000-0002-4503-4621; Pasta, Mauro/0000-0002-2613-4555													0897-4756	1520-5002				APR 9	2019	31	7					2619	2626		10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b00471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b00471													WOS:000464477100045

Designing multifunctional nanocomposite by selfassembled strategy with integration of various functional components into one platform is promising for effective breast cancer therapy. Herein, a L-arginine embedded Prussian blue analogue@polypyrrole@manganese oxide (PBA@PPy@MnO2) multifunctional nanocomposite was constructed by a facile self-assembled method, which could be used as an effective nanoplatform for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided multimodal therapy for breast cancer. Various properties such as enhanced MRI and catalytic capacity from PBA and MnO2, photothermal conversion performance from PPy, and NO generation capacity from Arg were integrated into one nanocomposite. In vitro and vivo experiments, satisfactory anti-cancer efficiency was observed in PBA@PPy@MnO2@Arg nanoplatform under near-infrared irradiation (NIR) due to the combined effect between chemodynamic therapy (CDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and gas therapy (GT). This work will pave a new avenue for the construction of multifunctional nanoplatforms and overcome the inherit poor photothermal and MRI activities limitations of Prussian blue analogue in biomedical field.

F.; Sotres, Javier; Falk, Magnus			Portable Prussian Blue-Based Sensor for Bacterial Detection in Urine	SENSORS												Bacterial infections can affect the skin, lungs, blood, and brain, and are among the leading causes of mortality globally. Early infection detection is critical in diagnosis and treatment but is a time- and work-consuming process taking several days, creating a hitherto unmet need to develop simple, rapid, and accurate methods for bacterial detection at the point of care. The most frequent type of bacterial infection is infection of the urinary tract. Here, we present a wireless-enabled, portable, potentiometric sensor for E. coli. E. coli was chosen as a model bacterium since it is the most common cause of urinary tract infections. The sensing principle is based on reduction of Prussian blue by the metabolic activity of the bacteria, detected by monitoring the potential of the sensor, transferring the sensor signal via Bluetooth, and recording the output on a laptop or a mobile phone. In sensing of bacteria in an artificial urine medium, E. coli was detected in similar to 4 h (237 +/- 19 min; n = 4) and in less than 0.5 h (21 +/- 7 min, n = 3) using initial E. coli concentrations of similar to 10(3) and 10(5) cells mL(-1), respectively, which is under or on the limit for classification of a urinary tract infection. Detection of E. coli was also demonstrated in authentic urine samples with bacteria concentration as low as 10(4) cells mL(-1), with a similar response recorded between urine samples collected from different volunteers as well as from morning and afternoon urine samples.

Revealing the Thermal Safety of Prussian Blue Cathode for Safer Nonaqueous Batteries	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS												Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising cathode materials for many next-generation metal-ion batteries due to their exceptional electrochemical performance. Their oxygen-free structure avoids a common battery thermal runaway pathway which requires O-2 liberation. Herein, the thermal runaway mechanisms of PBAs are studied from the level of material and full cell in nonaqueous sodium- and potassium-ion batteries (SIBs and KIBs). Their hidden safety issue and a novel runaway mechanism that requires no oxygen evolution are identified. The cyanide groups are released (approximate to 51.4 wt%) as toxic cyanides above 200 degrees C, which also exothermically react with the electrolyte and cause the runaway. The cyanide gas generation mechanism is proposed as cathode hydrolytic disproportionation by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy, and operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies. In addition, full-cell level calorimetric studies reveal mitigated heat generation but lower initiation temperature of runaway from such SIBs and KIBs than conventional LiCoO2-graphite system. These results change how PBA materials are evaluated from a safety standpoint, suggesting that they cannot be regarded as safe cathodes. They also indicate the correlations between thermal safety and their crystal defects or trapped water content. The proposed thermal runaway mechanism provides insights to assist in the building of safer next-generation batteries.

Herein, we demonstrate that fluorination of ZIF-67 Framework templated Prussian blue analogue hollow nano-box is highly efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The structure and morphology observation shows the degree of structural transformation and morphology are influenced by the fluorination temperature, and the catalytic ability for OER is correspondingly correlated to these characters. The product obtained at the annealed temperature of 250 degrees C exhibits the highest catalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 243 mV (No IR correction) to offer 10 mA cm(-2) when loaded on the inert glass carbon electrode, which is much better than that of the commercial IrO2 catalysts. High catalytic stability and kinetics are also found for the OER. Moreover, it has the highest intrinsic activity as demonstrated by the specific activity and turnover frequency indicating the intrinsic advantages of fluorination and hollow nano-box structure. This study enriches the application of Prussian blue analogue based hollow materials for OER by facile fluorination at low temperatures.					裴, 晨刚/AAZ-2771-2021; Feng, Ligang/E-9507-2014	Feng, Ligang/0000-0001-9879-0773; Pei, Chengang/0000-0002-2938-0970													1385-8947	1873-3212				JAN 1	2021	403								126371	10.1016/j.cej.2020.126371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.126371													WOS:000579752500093

While cubic symmetry is confirmed by XRD and TEM, IR and XPS show characteristic features different from Prussian Blue compositions. When investigated as cathode materials in sodium ion batteries, both compounds exhibit reversible capacities above 140 mAh g(-1) at 1C (ca. 80 mA g(-1)). While sodium Prussian White shows better high rate capability (10C/0.1C = 0.64), potassium Prussian White exhibits longer cycle stability, with up to 80% of capacity retention after 500 cycles. Interestingly, the potassium Prussian White phase also provides an increase of 0.35 V in the high voltage redox peak compared to the sodium Prussian White analogue ascribed to the preferential insertion of K+ ions instead of Na+, resulting in an increment of the gravimetric energy density. On the other hand, the insertion of Na+ seems to occur at the lower voltage plateau. This hybrid Na+ and K+ insertion in the framework of potassium Prussian White is most likely the responsible of the long cycle stability as a consequence of synergistic effects.

Our approach involves the use of a Fe(CN)(5) bridging group not only as a cyanide precursor for the formation of a PB-type structure but also as an electron shuttle between an organic chromophore and the catalytic center. The resulting hetero-functional PB-modified TiO2 electrode demonstrates a low-cost and easy-to-construct photoanode, which exhibits favorable electron transfers with a remarkable excited state lifetime on the order of nanoseconds and an extended light absorption capacity of up to 500 nm.

Herein, the terephthalic acid etched stepwise hollow bulky PB cubes and the intimate contact mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) particles with the adhered minisize PB cubes can together build continuous conductive networks. The composite (donated as N-PB@CMK) has high electrical conductivity, low resistance, and ultrahigh specific surface, which can lead to high capacitive contribution ratios.

Even cycling at 1 A g(-1) the reversible capacity can be measured to 102 mAh g(-1) and exhibit stability over a long cycle. In situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were further measured to illustrate the phase transition of crystal structure along with the extraction/insertion processes of Na+ ions. Especially, the assembled full cell with NaTi2 (PO4)(3)@C anode can also show good stability and provide promising insights of applying the N-PB@CMK for energy storage systems in the future.

Light-controlled EB is considered to be an attractive approach because the photon mode allows access to a wide variety of materials with high speed, remote control, noncontact, and superior resolution. In this work, we report a detailed photocontrolled EB effect in the well-defined CoO@CoFePBA core-shell heteronanostructure, where the EB effect of this composite can be permanently changed after being exposed to light. As demonstrated, such an interesting photo controlled effect is actually affected by the composition of the CoFePBA shell. More deeply, the alkali-metal-ion content in the CoFePBA shell is the major factor in controlling these hybrids' EB effects. Different alkali-metal insertions result in different ratios of the FeIII-CoII magnetic pair to the FeII-CoIII diamagnetic pair in the CoFePBA shell, where FeIII-CoII and FeII-CoIII control the magnetic and photomagnetic effects of CoFePBA, respectively. Therefore, the photocontrolled EB effect of the whole nanohybrid can be adjusted by the amount of alkali-metal insertion in the CoFePBA shell. This study is an advance in the research of light-controlled EB effects, which are useful for the evolution of new functional spintronic devices, such as photomagnetic switches, photomagnetic sensors, and photointelligent information storage materials.

However, in order to obtain high-capacity sodium storage Prussian blue materials, the currently used high-energy hydrothermal method or interstitial coprecipitation method is difficult to meet large-scale energy storage applications.

In this work, a simple stator-rotor reactor (RSSDR) reactor and precipitation transformation were used to improve the crystallization and precipitation process of iron-based Prussian blue, and continuous production was realized. The effects of particles with different morphologies on the products after aging were investigated, and the specific capacity (162.4 mAh g(-1) at 34 mA g(-1)) and cycle retention rate (capacity retention of 64.97% for 200 cycles at the current density of 170 mA g(-1)) of iron-based Prussian blue were improved.

Here, we demonstrate the versatility of a self-templated epitaxial growth strategy for construction of single-crystalline hollow nanostructured Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). Specifically, this strategy enables a controllable synthesis of Co-Fe PBA cages, frames, and boxes with diverse geometries by tuning their growth kinetics and thus expands the richness of their topological complexity. As an attempt, the topologies of these structures are identified and discussed. After thermal treatment, the corresponding oxide derivatives with preserved structures exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium, where the frame structures demonstrate the best catalytic performance.

J	Babu, S; Lee, K; Yang, H				Babu, Sathyan; Lee, Kyuseok; Yang, Haesik			Enzymatic Precipitation of Highly Electroactive and Ion-Transporting Prussian Blue for a Sensitive Electrochemical Immunosensor	ACS SENSORS												Sensitive and/or multiplex electrochemical biosensors often require efficient (bio)catalytic conversion of substrates into insoluble electroactive products. The enzymatic formation and precipitation of coordination polymers under mild conditions offers a promising solution for this purpose. Herein, we report the enzymatic precipitation of Prussian blue (PB), a highly electroactive and ion-transporting coordination polymer, on an immunosensing electrode for application in a sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for detecting thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Five pairs of redox enzymes and their specific reductants were examined to achieve rapid PB precipitation and electrochemical oxidation. Among these pairs, O-2-insensitive flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) paired with glucose yielded the highest electrochemical signal-to-background (S/B) ratio. FAD-GDH catalyzed the conversion of Fe(CN)(6)(3-) to Fe(CN)(6)(4-), which coordinated with Fe3+, leading to PB formation and subsequent precipitation through repeated conversions. The resulting PB precipitate, with its close proximity to the electrode, facilitated rapid electrochemical oxidation and generated a strong electrochemical signal. Notably, the precipitation and electrochemical oxidation of PB were more effective than those of its analogues. When applied to a sandwich-type immunosensor for TSH detection, the enzymatic PB precipitation achieved a calculated detection limit of approximately 2 pg/mL in artificial serum, covering the clinically relevant range. These findings indicate the potential widespread utility of PB precipitation and electrochemical oxidation for sensitive multiplex biomarker detection.

NANO ENERGY												Owing to the high theoretical specific capacity, long cycle life, abundant resources and environmental benignity, iron-based Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been investigated widely in recent years. Although major efforts have been concentrated on exploitation of high performance's PBAs cathode materials, there is still deficiency of a deep understanding of the relevance between the reaction processes and capacity degradation mechanism with the active high-spin (HS)/ low-spin (LS) iron sites, which is of great significance. In this work, well-crystallized and shape-controlled monoclinic Prussian blue (M-PB) was successfully prepared, with remarkable electrochemical performance, especially in cycling perfor-mance (88% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 120 mAh g-1, and 81% after 980 cycles). More significantly, with state-of-the-art operando Mo spacing diaeresis ssbauer spectroscopy, ex-situ 77 K Mo spacing diaeresis ssbauer spectroscopy, ex-situ X-ray ab-sorption spectroscopy and operando X-ray diffraction, the reaction and capacity degradation mechanism were investigated thoroughly and the detailed reaction process was figured out for the first time. The result showed clearly that the HS Fe in M-PB reacts completely and contributes to most capacity, while only part of LS Fe reacts. Therefore, the capacity enhancement should be achieved by activating LS Fe. Furthermore, the LS Fe (Fe-C---N) results in more severe crystal structure change than HS Fe (Fe-N---C) of the same amount in the electrochemical reaction process, thus the partial reaction of LS Fe in M-PB could be the reason for its excellent cycling per-formance. This work not only investigated the reaction and capacity degradation mechanism, but also shed light on the design of high-performance PBAs-based cathodes for SIBs.

J	Yin, DD; Han, C; Bo, XJ; Liu, J; Guo, LP				Yin, Duanduan; Han, Ce; Bo, Xiangjie; Liu, Jian; Guo, Liping			Prussian blue analogues derived iron-cobalt alloy embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers for efficient oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic solutions	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												Exploring highly active, inexpensive and robust electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great significance as a competitive alternative to noble metal-based catalysts in energy conversion and storage devices. In the present study, we design a novel ORR electrocatalyst of iron-cobalt (FeCo) alloy nanoparticles embedded on N-doped porous carbon nanofibers (FeCo@PCNF-T) by electrospinning of [Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/Prussian blue analogues/CaCO3] and post-calcination treatment. The obtained catalysts with bimetallic active sites show unique three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical meso/macropores structures. FeCo alloy nanoparticles are encapsulated into graphitic carbon that can increase stability and provide additional catalytic active sites. Under the optimized condition, FeCo@PCNF-800 displays excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solutions, with a more positive half-wave potential (E-1/2 of 0.854 V vs RHE) and larger limited-diffusion current density (j of 6.012 mA cm(-2)) than those of 20 wt% Pt/C (E-1/2 of 0.849 V and j of 5.710 mA cm(-2)). In addition, FeCo@PCNF-800 also exhibits comparable ORR electrocatalytic activity in acidic solutions to those of 20 wt% Pt/C with onset potential and half-wave potential as more positive as 0.843 V vs RHE and 0.739 V vs RHE, respectively. Moreover, FeCo@PCNF-800 exhibits excellent tolerance towards methanol, stability and a four-electron pathway in both basic and acidic solutions. The excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity performance of FeCo@PCNF-800 is attributed to the synergistic effect of the FeCo alloy nanoparticles and N-doped porous carbon nanofibers. The synergistic effect can improve the mass and charge transport capability and increase active sites of FeCo-N-C. Furthermore, this work offers a new insight for the reasonable design and development of efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts for challenging electrochemical energy related technologies.

Switchable self-assembly of Prussian blue analogs nano-tiles triggered by salt stimulus	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are materials well known for their bulk physical and (electro)-chemical properties, with an outstanding selectivity for caesium in ion exchange processes. Crystalline nano-tiles, made of copper based PBA, are produced and dispersed in water by tuning their electrostatic interactions. The shape and size of the nano-crystals are determined by combining scattering, microscopic and spectral techniques. We show here that Cu-PBA nano-tiles form planar superstructures by an edge to edge self-assembly process controlled by specific cation effect and ionic strength. Sedimentation and (re-)dispersion of the nano-tiles are found to be fully reversible. This switchable anisotropic self-assembly triggered by salt stimulus makes PBA nanocrystals potentially interesting for applications.

At the beginning the dark blue coloured device, shifts reversibly between translucent and dark-blue while applying an applied bias between +1 to -1 V with an opposite polarization. Amine functionalized silicate sol-gel matrix (SSG) is used as a solid support and stabilizer for electrodepositing highly uniform sub-10 nm PB NSs. The SSG's film thickness is suitably optimized through suitable controlled experiments. It is found that the SPE behaviour of sub-10 nm sized PB NSs, suitably followed a colour modulation of PB into Prussian white (PW) and vice-versa. SPE studies are used to investigate the redox switching between the PB and PW and which are responsible for an electrochromic function of a fabricated electrochromic device (ECD). Fabricated ECD has demonstrated an optical modulation at 680 nm with the moderate coloration efficiency of 115.8 cm(2)/C. Present study validates the SPE feature of sub-10 nm PB NSs as an active electrochromic nanomaterial and demonstrating the applicability of SPE technique to investigate the variety of electrochromic nanomaterials, with consequences in both spectral and electrochemically active nanomaterials for electrochromic device applications.

The resulted composite film electrode successfully inherits the merit of different building blocks: MXene layers works as binders and conductive additives that can connect cubic Ni-Fe oxide nanoparticals, facilitate the charge transfer and avoid a significant conductivity decrease in the resulting electrode. While cubic Ni-Fe oxide serves as an active spacer inside the adjacent MXene layers to increase the interlayer space, facilitate the electrolyte diffusion and enhance the electrochemical activity of the composite film. As a result, the optimized composite film manifests excellent specific capacitance of 1038.43 mF cm(-2) at current density 0.5 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile by assembling into all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor, an excellent specific areal capacitance of 328.35 mF cm(-2) at 0.2 mA cm(-2) was achieved. Additionally, the excellent energy storage performance is well maintained with a capacitance retention of 90.9% during 10,000 charging-discharging long cycles. Furthermore, a high mechanical robustness with 88.9% capacitance remained after subjected to bending at 90 degrees for 50 cycles, suggesting great potentials for the applications in future flexible and wearable devices.

Transition metal-based phosphides as a kind of highly efficient oxygen reaction (OER) catalyst is considered as a judicious select for renewable energy conversion and storage. In this work, CoFeP nanocube-arrays (NCAs) composite is successfully fabricated on a 3D porous conductive substrate (nickel foam), namely as CoFeP/NF. The CoFeP/NF material exhibits exciting electrocatalytic performance with extremely low overpotentials of 253 and 290 mV at the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Especially, remarkable durability for 100 h can be observed, which is a key parameter for practical application. CoFeP/NF parallel to Pt/C/NF as a two-electrode system is applied into overall water splitting. A series of outstanding electrocatalytic results are obtained, including a very low voltage of 1.54 V for achieving the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with remarkable stability in 1 M KOH. These performances have far superior to commercial noble metal of IrO2/NF parallel to Pt/C/NF. Therefore, this work not only provides some practical electrocatalyst materials, more importantly, it opens a feasible and universal strategy for constructing well-defined nanocube-array electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.

Ironbased Prussian blue (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3) analogs promise low-cost and easily prepared cathode materials for sodium metal-ion batteries. However, the effectiveness of these materials has consistently been attributed to their inadequate electrical conductivity. In this study, we employed a one-pot synthesis technique to prepare composites of Prussian blue (PB) and reduced graphene oxide (PB/rGO) with varying rGO concentrations. Ascorbic acid was utilized as a reducing agent to convert graphene oxide (GO) into reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Following optimization, the SMB coin cell with PB/rGO(5 %) electrode exhibited an initial specific discharge capacity of 91 mAh/g at a current density of 0.3C. This electrode had exceptional rate performance and remarkable capacity retention, with 75.3 % remaining after 2000 cycles. Furthermore, the pouch cell SMB using PB/rGO(5 %) showed a high capacity of 87 mAh/g at 0.05C with an energy density of 34 Wh kg- 1 and good cycle ability over 500 cycles.

It is revealed that systematic fine tuning of the electronic energy levels is optically and electrochemically possible in the films by controlling the composition ratios. This is possible due to the d(t(2g))-pi*( C equivalent to N-) electronic conjugation among three redoxactive iron species, Fe-II-C equivalent to N, Fe-III-C equivalent to N, and Fe-III-N equivalent to C, which coexist by alloying with Ni. The heating process conducts the restoration of discontinued d-pi* bonding networks among the NPs.					; Ishizaki, Manabu/S-9755-2018; KAWAMOTO, Tohru/B-7145-2008; TANAKA, Hisashi/F-8212-2017	Ono, Kenta/0000-0001-7975-1322; Ishizaki, Manabu/0000-0003-0522-1825; KAWAMOTO, Tohru/0000-0002-3984-2980; TANAKA, Hisashi/0000-0003-0604-5528													2199-692X					MAY	2017	3	5					288	291		10.1002/cnma.201700084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cnma.201700084													WOS:000403299200002

However, controlled synthesis of high-performance PBA is still challenging. In this work, a facile precipitation route was used to synthesize Na-rich PBAs with superior electrochemical performance. It was found that two shapes of the products, namely, small irregular particles and large cuboid particles, coexist by adding sodium citrate in the sodium hexacyanoferrate side during the synthesis. The product shows large capacity (144 mAh g(-1) under a 0.1 C rate), good rate performance (115.6 mAh g(-1) under a 1 C rate, 86.6 mAh g(-1) under a 10 C rate), and long-term cycling stability (73.4% retention after 780 cycles under a 0.5 C rate, 72.7% retention after 2100 cycles under a 1 C rate).

The approach for surface modification with metal oxides for boosting the performance, however, is rarely reported. Herein, a facile surface anchoring strategy has been proposed to realize CeO2 nanocrystals uniformly depositing on the surface of PB. Besides, the size, thickness, and depositing density of CeO2 nanocrystals can be regulated by adjusting the amount of the precursor and the proportion of ethanol and deionized water. Furthermore, after a step of confined pyrolysis treatment under an air atmosphere, CeO2 nanocrystals with an encapsulated iron oxide structure have been obtained. This shows a remarkable cycling and rate performance when evaluated as an anode of the lithium-ion battery. The surface anchoring approach of the CeO2 nanocrystals may not only promote the various applications of PB-based materials but also provide an opportunity for developing the architecture of other CeO2-based core-shell nanostructures.

However, their practical application is hindered by limited structural stability and restricted ionic diffusion channels inherent to the DOC structure. In this study, we have successfully integrated a mixed tetrahedral and octahedral coordination (TOC) structure with the DOC structure by a dual polymerization and high-entropy strategy, thereby optimizing the central metal coordination environment in hexacyanoferrate cathodes. It leverages the TOC structure's superiorities in structural stability and ionic diffusion, resulting in a hexacyanoferrate-based cathode that exhibits exceptional performance, with a capacity retention of 81.6% after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 and high rate capabilities of 96.7 and 89.1 mAh g-1 at 0.5 and 1 A g-1, respectively. These findings not only underscore the potential of the TOC design for prussian blue cathodes but also pave the way for the development of high-performance, durable sodium-ion battery systems.					cao, xin/GLS-7854-2022; Huang, JF/F-1119-2019	Cao, Xin/0000-0002-2548-043X													2405-8297	2405-8289				JAN	2025	74								103890	10.1016/j.ensm.2024.103890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2024.103890		NOV 2024											WOS:001356702500001

In this paper, the type-II heterojunction was successfully constructed with CoFe-PBA/GDY and applied in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in-situ XPS analysis were used to infer a potential mechanism for the formation of photocatalytic hydrogen. It was shown that the construction of type-II heterojunction induced the transfer of photogenerated electrons from CoFe-PBA to GDY, and suppressed the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in CoFe-PBA/GDY. The highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of CoFe-PBA/GDY-15 is among them, 71.24 mu mol of hydrogen are precipitated in just 4h, 14.07 times that of GDY (5.06 mu mol) and 14.97 times that of CoFe-PBA (4.76 mu mol).

However, PBA suffer from low electronic conductivity and mechanical instability, which may be improved by their structural modification leading to enhanced kinetics. In this regard, we report an in-situ integration of ultra-small PBA cubes into threedimensional metal organic framework (MOF) derived carbon-doped manganese oxide nanorods (C-Mn2O3), which form a continuous conductive architecture with intimate PBA/C-Mn2O3 contact. The C-Mn2O3 nanorods provide nucleation sites for the growth of PBA cubes and further act as the electronic pathway to improve electrode reaction kinetics. This hierarchical configuration effectively buffers the lattice expansion, which improve the structural stability of NiCoPBA. Consequently, the composite exhibits promising performance in aqueous Na+ batteries. Specifically, it delivers a high capacity of 97 mAh/g within a narrow potential window of and retained 82% capacity for 1000 cycles in aqueous electrolyte. It shows even higher capacity of 136 mAh/g and similar capacity retention (76% after 1000 cycles) in non-aqueous electrolytes. The promising performance of developed materials demonstrates the significant impact decreasing the size of PBA cubes has on the capacity by reducing the diffusion pathways and thus facilitating intercalation/deintercalation within the cubes. This study offers new insights of exploiting redox-active substrates to modify and stabilize PBA materials for energy storage applications.

Here, we report an interesting isotropic NTE property in cubic GaFe(CN)(6) Prussian blue analogues (alpha(l) = -3.95 X 10(-6) K-1, 100-475 K), which is a new example to understand the complex NTE mechanism. A combined study of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, X-ray total scattering, X-ray absorption fine structure, neutron powder diffraction, and density functional theory calculations shows that the NTE of GaFe(CN)(6) originates from the low-frequency phonons (< similar to 100 cm(-1)), which are directly related to the transverse vibrations of the atomic -Ga-N C-Fe-chains. Both the Ga-N and Fe-C chemical bonds are much softer to bend than to stretch. The direct evidence that transverse vibrational contribution to the NTE of GaFe(CN)(6) is dominated by N, instead of C atoms, is illustrated. It is interesting to find that the polyhedra of GaFe(CN)(6) are not rigid, which is a starting assumption in some models describing the NTE properties of other systems. The NTE mechanism can be vividly described by the "guitar-string" effect, which would be the common feature for the NTE property of many open-framework functional materials, such as Prussian blue analogues, oxides, cyanides, metal-organic frameworks, and zeolites.

A uniform distribution of each element makes the PBAs robust templates to prepare hollow and highly porous (hetero)nanostructures of metal oxides, sulfides, carbides, nitrides, phosphides, and (N-doped) carbon, among other compositions. In this review, we examine methods to derive materials from PBAs focusing on the correlation between synthesis steps and derivative morphologies and composition.

The detection of the pathogens present on contaminated surfaces is crucial, although not always possible with current microbial detection technologies requiring sample collection and transfer to the laboratory. Based on a simple sonochemical coating process, smart hospital fabrics with the capacity to detect live bacteria by a simple change of colour are presented here. Prussian Blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) are sonochemically coated on polyester-cotton textiles in a single-step requiring 15 min. The presence of PB-NPs confers the textile with an intensive blue colour and with bacterial-sensing capacity. Live bacteria in the textile metabolize PB-NPs and reduce them to colourless Prussian White (PW), enabling in situ detection of bacterial presence in less than 6 h with the bare eye (complete colour change requires 40 h). The smart textile is sensitive to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, responsible for most nosocomial infections. The redox reaction is completely reversible and the textile recovers its initial blue colour by re-oxidation with environmental oxygen, enabling its re-use. Due to its simplicity and versatility, the current technology can be employed in different types of materials for control and prevention of microbial infections in hospitals, industries, schools and at home.

Recently, the molecular crowding electrolyte (MCE) strategy has been proposed to improve the electrolyte voltage stability window (ESW) of electrolytes, in this work, we report an improved xMC (x: ratio, MC: molecular crowding agent) electrolyte that uses N-N dimethylacetamide (DMAC) as the molecular crowding agent and NaOTf as the advanced salt with an ESW of 2.65 V and excellent nonflammability. The side reactions of the NaCoPBA//Hard Carbon (HC) full-cell active material are improved with the aid of the electrolyte. Capacity retention of 75 % after 600 cycles with excellent cycling stability. These results demonstrate that this advanced MCE strategy can be utilized for practical applications designed for safety, high specific capacity and long cycle (ASIB).

We demonstrate that fine control over the size, morphology, and the degree and homogeneity of the surface coverage by Prussian Blue (PB) nanostructures may be achieved by manipulating different parameters, which are the precursor concentration, the nature of the functional groups or the nature of lipids on the surfaces. This allows the growth of isolated PB nanopyramids and nanocubes or the design of thin dense films over centimeter square surfaces. The formation of unusual Prussian blue nanopyramids is discussed. Finally, we demonstrate, by using experimental techniques and theoretical modeling, that PB nanoparticles deposited on the gold surface exhibit strong photothermal properties, permitting a rapid temperature increase up to 90 degrees C with a conversion of the laser power of almost 50% for power source heat.

In this case, the appropriate metal sulfide derivatives were created using Ni-Co prussian blue analogue nano units as a precursor, which took on the precursor's structural traits. More reaction sites are exposed by this distinctive structural design, and a little quantity of nitrogen-doped carbon is produced, which improves charge transfer. The box-like structure has a buffer effect on the stress of the active material during charging and discharging, and the heterostructure of mixed metal sulfides and nitrogen-doped carbon composite cubic can both significantly increase the electrode's electrochemical capacitance and cycling stability. The CoS2/Ni3S4-N-C offers a capacitance of 817C g- 1 at 3 A g- 1 and 556C g- 1 at 20 A g- 1. The CoS2/Ni3S4-N-C electrode also has outstanding cycle stability (98.2 % capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device made of CoS2/Ni3S4-N-C with activated carbon electrodes exhibits exceptional cycle stability. With a retention rate of 103.7 % after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g- 1 and an energy density of 40 Wh kg - 1. Using density functional theory (DFT), the electron characteristics of Co2NiO4 and CoS2/Ni3S4-N-C are compared. CoS2/Ni3S4-N-C detected more state densities at the Fermi level, which causes more charge to accumulate. This shows that the heterojunction's electron conductivity is significantly greater than the oxide's, and ultimately leads to quicker reaction kinetics.

Herein, PBA materials with different structural defects, constructed via regulating electronic state of Fe-ion, are regarded as cathode materials for SIBs. It is confirmed that anionic vacancies and coordinated water molecules gradually decrease with the increase of FeIII-ion with the weaker metal activity than FeII. As a result, FeIII[FeIII(CN)6] electrode with the lowest structural defects displays the highest reversible specific capacity of 121.4 mA h g-1 with an energy density of 356.9 Wh kg-1 at 10 mA g-1 and the best cyclic stability compared with NaFeIII[FeII(CN)6] and Na2FeII[FeII(CN)6]. Na-ion intercalation/deintercalation proceeds by a reversible phase transition mechanism (cubic <-> cubic/rhombo-hedral <-> rhombohedral) relied on 2-electron transfer per formula using FeII/FeIII as redox sites, which is verified by ex situ XRD and XPS tests. Besides, high anionic vacancies and specific surface area boost the NaFeIII[FeII(CN)6] electrode to exhibit fast Na-ion transfer ability, thus contributing superior rate property.

Until now, the intercalation mechanism of Zn2+ into MnHCF has not been clearly illustrated. In this work, combining different synchrotron X-ray techniques, the structural and microscopic evolution of MnHCF in 3 m ZnSO4 electrolyte is comprehensively studied, and a thorough understanding of the intercalation/release dynamic, in terms of local and long-range domain, is provided. The elemental distribution and structural information of Fe, Mn, Zn inside MnHCF electrodes is obtained from the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental maps and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The in-depth analysis of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) signals confirm that the rearrangement of Mn site, evidencing the cleavage of the Mn & horbar;N bond with the formation of a Mn & horbar;O bond, in an octahedral environment. The phase transformation of MnHCF takes place exclusively during the 1st cycle, and a mixture of rhombohedral and cubic zinc hexacynoferrate (ZnHCF) phases are formed during the first charge process. Thereafter, the newly formed cubic ZnHCF phase becomes the only stable one, existing in the subsequent cycles and exhibiting excellent electrochemical stability.

Nevertheless, the practical application of PBAs is limited by their intrinsic poor electronic conductivity and structural degradation. Herein, a unique high entropy (HE) Prussian blue Analogs encapsulated by three-dimensional carbon (HE-PBAs@C) was for the first time designed and synthesized by combining the merits of HE and 3D confinement effect originating from carbon wrapping (CW). The HE strategy guarantees the inherent stability of PBAs and promotes accelerated Na+ diffusion, while the CW technique serves a dual purpose by enhancing electronic conductivity and mitigating lattice distortion through the 3D confinement effect. As a result, the HE-PBAs@C cathode exhibits impressive electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity (120.2 mA h g-1 at 10 mA g-1), outstanding rate performance (73.0 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1), excellent capacity retention (80.1% after 4000 cycles at 2 A g-1) and unprecedented stability in the ambient environment. Furthermore, the HE-PBAs@C cathode demonstrates excellent compatibility with both hard carbon (700 cycles 95.4%) and NaTi2(PO4)3 (1000 cycles 98.1%) anodes in full cells, highlighting its promising potential for large-scale energy storage applications. By combining the benefits of high entropy (HE) and carbon wrapping (CW), HEPBAs@0.1C achieves excellent electrochemical performance and unprecedented stability in the ambient environment.

Cation Adaptive Structures Based on Manganese Cyanide Prussian Blue Analogues: Application of Powder Diffraction Data to Solve Complex, Unprecedented Stoichiometries and New Structure Types	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL												A Mn(II) salt and A+CN- under anaerobic conditions react to form 2-D and 3-D extended structured compounds of AmMnIIn(CN)m+2n stoichiometry. Here, the creation and characterization of this large family of compounds, for example AMnII3(CN)7, A2MnII3(CN)8, A2MnII5(CN)12, A3MnII5(CN)13, and A2MnII[MnII(CN)6], where A represents alkali and tetraalkylammonium cations, is reviewed. Cs2MnII[MnII(CN)6] has the typical Prussian blue face centered cubic unit cell. However, the other alkali salts are monoclinic or rhombohedral. This is in accord with smaller alkali cation radii creating void space that is minimized by increasing the van der Waals stabilization energy by reducing angle Mn-N equivalent to C, which, strengthens the magnetic coupling and increases the magnetic ordering temperatures. This is attributed to the non-rigidity of the framework structure due the significant ionic character associated with the high-spin MnII sites. For larger tetraalkylammonium cations, the high-spin Mn sites lack sufficient electrostatic A+& sdot;& sdot;& sdot;NC stabilization and form unexpected 4- and 5-coordinated Mn sites within a flexible, extended framework around the cation; hence, the size, shape, and charge of the cation dictate the unprecedented stoichio-metry and unpredictable cation adaptive structures. Antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent MnII sites leads to ferrimagnetic ordering, but in some cases antiferromagnetic coupling of ferrimagnetic layers are compensated and synthetic antiferromagnets are observed. The magnetic ordering temperatures for ferrimagnetic A2MnII[MnII(CN)6] with both octahedral high- and low-spin MnII sites increase with decreasing angle Mn-N equivalent to C. The crystal structures for all of the extended structured materials were obtained by powder diffraction. New extended structure types and unprecedented stoichiometries form from ionic MnII and ionic cyanides as a consequence of the shape of the cyanide cation that have applications as molecule-based magnets and batteries.image						Stephens, Peter/0000-0002-8311-7305													0947-6539	1521-3765				NOV 21	2023	29	65								10.1002/chem.202302136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.202302136		OCT 2023						37572364					WOS:001084192100001

We synthesized PB, cobalt-PB analogue (Co-PBA), nickel (Ni)-PBA, and copper (Cu)-PBA NPs and prepared the corresponding aqueous NP inks with or without 10 vol% PEDOT:PSS additive. Uniform EC films with high visual contrast were coated onto ITO electrodes by repeated spin-coating of the NP inks. The EC films were characterized with SEM, cyclic voltammetry, Li+ diffusion speed, and in situ spectroelectrochemical methods. The EC colors of PB, Co-PBA, Ni-PBA, and Cu-PBA were achieved with these NP films. In particular, the PB NP film showed reversible green and yellow electrochromism that were not possible for an electrodeposited PB film, and Co-PBA, Ni-PBA and Cu-PBA films with sufficient thickness to exhibit visualized EC colors were also difficult to attain by electrodeposition. We also proved that a multicolor EC film could be prepared by a simple layer-by-layer interchanged coating of two different PBA NPs (e.g., PB and Ni-PBA). Finally, we assembled a new, multicolor, and full-PBA EC window prototype based on a PB/Ni-PBA working electrode and a Cu-PBA counterelectrode. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, bimetallic selenide with a hollow nanocube structure exhibits remarkable catalyst activity towards the UOR. A hierarchical MOF-based Prussian blue analogue (PBA) is constructed by growing Ni-Co PBA on an MOF-Ni template. By controlling the reaction time and temperature, the Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue (denoted as PBA@MOF-Ni) has the morphology of nanocubes evenly growing on flower-like MOF-Ni. After the selenide reaction by a solvothermal method, PBA@MOF-Ni is converted to Co-Ni/Se (denoted as PBA@MOF-Ni/Se), which has a structure with hollow nanocubes and maintains the shape of a flower. This hierarchical MOF-based PBA selenide exhibits good catalytic activity due to the addition of MOFs and the synergistic effect of bimetals. PBA@MOF-Ni/Se can be used as both a cathode and an anode in urea electrolysis. In particular for the UOR, the performance of PBA@MOF-Ni/Se is much better than that for the OER. In the performance comparison between urea electrolysis and water splitting, PBA@MOF-Ni/Se parallel to PBA@MOF-Ni/Se only needs 1.49 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than the voltage required for water splitting.

Owing to the high similarities of its ionic form to iron (Fe) and the resulting cellular homeostasis disruption performance, physiologically unstable and low-toxicity gallium (Ga) has garnered considerable attention clinically as an anti-carcinogen. Herein, Ga-based nanoparticles (NPs) with diverse Ga contents are fabricated in one step using PB with abundant Fe sites as a substrate for Ga substitution, which aims to overcome the deficiencies of both and develop an effective nanomedicine. A systematic comparison of their physicochemical properties effectively reveals the saturated Ga introduction state during the synthesis process, further identifying the most Ga-enriched PB NPs with a substitution content of >50% as a nanomedicine for subsequent exploration. It is verified that the Ga interference mechanisms mediated by the most Ga-enriched PB NPs are implicated in metabolic disorders, ionic homeostasis disruption, cellular structure dysfunction, apoptosis, autophagy, and target activation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. This study provides significant guidance on exploiting clinically approved agents for Ga interference and lays the foundation for the next generation of PB-based theranostic agents.

Three-Dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene-Prussian Blue Hybrid Microsupercapacitors by Water Lift-Off Lithography	ACS NANO												The construction of electrochemical energy-storage devices by scalable thin-film microfabrication methods with high energy and power density is urgently needed for many emerging applications. Herein, we demonstrate an in-plane hybrid microsupercapacitor with a high areal energy density by employing a battery-type CuFe-Prussian blue analogue (CuFe-PBA) as the positive electrode and pseudocapacitive titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) as the negative electrode. A three-dimensional lignin-derived laser-induced graphene electrode was prepared as the substrate by laser exposure combined with an environmentally friendly water lift-off lithography. The designed hybrid device achieved enhanced electrochemical performance thanks to the ideal match of the two types of high-rate performance materials in proton-based electrolytes and the numerous electrochemically active sites. In particular, the device delivers a high areal capacitance of 198 mF cm(-2), a wide potential window (1.6 V), an ultrahigh rate performance (75.8 mF cm(-2) retained even at a practical/high current density of 100 mA cm(-2)), and a competitive energy density of 70.5 and 27.6 mu Wh cm(-2) at the power densities 0.74 and 52 mW cm(-2), respectively. These results show that the Ti3C2Tx/CuFe-PBA hybrid microsupercapacitors are promising energy storage devices in miniaturized portable and wireless applications.

This paper synthesized manganese-iron Prussian blue (MnFe-PBA@IF) at room temperature, and hexagonal concave structures w ere prepared using a fast-reducing matrix. Interestingly, MnFe-PBA@IF has an amorphous structure favorable to exposing more active surfaces. According to Gibbs free energy calculations on MnFe-PBA, charge depletion of manganese atoms can greatly enhance the adsorption of electron-rich oxygen-containing groups on the surface. Furthermore, the overpotential in 1 m KOH is 280 mV. Also, it can be used as a supercapacitor with a stable operating voltage range of -0.9-0 V and a specific capacity of 1260 F g-1. This work provides new insights into the synthesis of OER catalysts for Prussian blue ferromanganese at room temperature. Non-gold-bonded adsorption, highly active metal centers and active surfaces are the underlying reasons for the superior performance of supercapacitors. Therefore, Prussian blue with good energy storage performance and high active surface can be used as multifunctional energy storage and conversion electrodes. MnFe-PBA@IF is synthesized at room temperature as a hexagonal concave amorphous structure. The synthesized amorphous Prussian blue with high oxygen precipitation reaction has non-gold bonded adsorption and highly reactive metal centers as well as active surfaces, which is fundamental to the superior performance of supercapacitors.image					Jiang, Qianqian/GNW-2840-2022; Wu, Xiaodong/KCY-1170-2024	Wu, Xiaodong/0000-0001-9703-0326; Huang, Huabo/0000-0001-5545-5916; Jiang, Qianqian/0000-0002-9877-6303													1613-6810	1613-6829				FEB	2024	20	7								10.1002/smll.202303946	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202303946		OCT 2023						37806767					WOS:001077008100001

However, their poor conductivity and stability hinder their application in the field of electrocatalysis. Herein, for the first time, we try to use an FCP such as a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) directly as a catalyst candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and report an ingenious confined heat treatment strategy to maximize its electrocatalytic performance. Our synthesized and treated NiFeII-PBA crystals were self-grown on conducting substrates and consisted of small nanocrystals, which enabled them to facilitate electron transport and expose more active sites. As a result, the NiFeII-PBA crystals exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen evolution in alkaline media, and an overpotential of only 285 mV is needed to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(-2).

However, their electrochemical performance is hindered by intrinsic structural vacancies and weak electronic conductivity, resulting in a reduced reversible capacity, multiplicative ability, and cycle stability. Herein, the carbon-blended Na2CoFe(CN)(6) (COHCF@C) prepared by a controlled crystallization method displays improved electrochemical characteristics. With 70% residual capacity after 200 cycles, the reversible specific capacity of the COHCF@C is 123 mAh g(-1) at 1 C. Furthermore, the COHCF@C also exhibits higher structural stability in aqueous electrolytes. Based on experimental results, this enhancement can be attributed to the introduction of carbon, slowing down the crystallization process and resulting in higher crystallinity. Additionally, the reduced water content leads to fewer defects, which improves the utilization of active sites. Overall, the finding provides an experimental basis and theoretical guidance for the application of PBA cells.					xu, zhiming/KGL-2113-2024; Wang, Wenju/E-4437-2012														1932-7447	1932-7455				SEP 26	2023	127	39					19424	19431		10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c05156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c05156		SEP 2023											WOS:001072738700001

Herein, we prepared molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)-decorated hollow nanoframes of a Co-Fe Prussian blue analog (Etched-PBA-MoS2) by mild chemical etching of the Co-Fe Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanocubes, followed by MoS2 decoration. We propose using an ethanol-water mixture as a mild etchant, eliminating the need for a capping or stabilizing agent. Prominently benefiting from the enhanced active surface area and the synergistic effect of multi-components, the as-prepared Etched-PBA-MoS2 nanoframes deposited on a microporous carbon cloth could deliver an excellent OER activity with an overpotential of only 260 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH.

Synthesis of CoFe Prussian blue analogue/poly vinylidene fluoride nanocomposite material with improved thermal stability and ferroelectric properties	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have recently been synthesized in the form of various heterostructures such as core-shell nanoparticles, layered thin films, and nanosized metal/PBAs for their multifunctional properties. However, herein, we report the synthesis of a nanocomposite CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFePBA) molecular magnet with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer. The cyanide (CN) group of CoFePBAs interacts with the CF2 dipole of PVDF to integrate PBAs uniformly into a PVDF matrix. Interestingly, the composite material exhibits a spontaneous polarization which is mainly due to the formation of the phase of PVDF. However, the value of electric polarization is observed to be higher (approximate to 0.04 C cm(-2)) than the spontaneous electric polarization (approximate to 0.02 C cm(-2)) of the bare PVDF. The higher value of electric polarization is attributed to the enhanced dipole-dipole interactions between the fluoride atoms of PVDF and the cyanide (-C?N-) ligand of CoFePBAs. Inclusion of PVDF in CoFePBAs not only helps in improving ferroelectricity, but also improves the thermal stability of the CoFePBAs (up to approximate to 158 degrees C), in contrast to the bare CoFePBAs, which are stable only up to approximate to 65 degrees C.

In this work, we take a closer look at the imaging and therapy performance of PB agents once they are doped with Mn2+. It is found that Mn2+-doped PB nano cubes exhibit increased longitudinal relaxivity along with enhanced optical absorption red-shifted to the near-infrared (NIR) region.

Here we propose a high-spin Fe substitution method to enhance the long-term cyclic stability of Mn-based Prussian blue analogue (Mn-PBA) cathode. The prepared K1.86Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.96)center dot 0 center dot 19H(2)O (KMF) are electrochemically activated for 20-cycle CV scan in the hybrid electrolyte containing KNO3+Fe(NO3)3. The modified cathode (KMF-100) achieves a high capacity of 185.8 mAh g(-1) and high-capacity retention of 89.8 % at 2 A g(-1) after 1500 cycles (based on maximum capacity). The high-spin Fe substitution strategy not only activates the transition metal at high spin sites to contribute extra capacity, but also promotes the partial dissolved Mn2+ to return to the PBA in the hybrid electrolyte with Fe3+, relieving the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn(III). In contrast, the KMF in the pure KNO3 electrolyte does not exhibit this behavior. The DFT calculation further demonstrate the reconstituted Prussian blue structure can increase the electrical conductivity and improve ion diffusion kinetics of the cathode material. Notably, it suppresses the change in C-Fe bond lengths during K-ion extraction, maintaining outstanding structural stability throughout cycle. This work provides a novel way to prepare high-stability manganese-based PBA cathode.

This particular PBA, which shows very good electrochemical performance as a cathode material in potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), undergoes three successive redox reactions during the (de-)potassiation that are hereby identified by ex situ(57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy and operando Mn and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. These reactions come along with notable modifications of the crystal structure, which are followed in real time by operando X-ray diffraction. The correlation of these results, interpreted with the support of chemometric methods, also reveals the limitations of this PBA, probably related to the deactivation of the Mn undergoing extensive reversible Jahn-Teller distortion during cycling as well as possible dissolution in the electrolyte.

J	Wu, CH; Chiu, YT; Lin, KYA				Wu, Chang-Hsun; Chiu, Yi-Ting; Lin, Kun-Yi Andrew			Macrosphere-supported nanoscale Prussian blue analogues prepared via self-assembly as multi-functional heterogeneous catalysts for aqueous oxidative and reductive reactions	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY												While Prussia Blue analogues (PBs) are promising catalysts, PBs are typically prepared to be nanoscale, making them less practical especially for solution-based reactions. Although a few attempts have developed substrate supported PBs, many of them are still very small and PB is not grown homogeneously. However, there is still an urgent demand for developing substrate-supported PB which is catalytically effective, convenient-to-prepare, simple-to-use and easy-to-recover. To this end, a macrosphere-supported nanoscale PB is proposed using ion exchange resins as readily available, robust and functionalized macrospheres. Through layer-by-layer impregnating resins in cobalt and hexacyanoferrate solutions, PB is grown on the surface of resins via self-assembling. Both cation and anion exchange resins (CR and AR) can be successfully employed to grown PB through the same self-assembling technique. The resulting PB@R can preserve porous structures and metal coordination of PB, and easy-to-handle features of resins, making them promising catalysts for aqueous catalytic reactions. As 4-NP reduction is selected as a model reductive reaction, PB@R quickly reduces 4-NP to 4-AP in the presence of NaBH4 and exhibits a much lower Ea compared to other reported precious metal catalysts. PB@R can also activate PMS to generate sulfate radicals to degrade organic pollutants. PB@R can be also packed in a column for continuous flow-through reductive and oxidative reactions. These results indicate that PB@R is a conveniently prepared and highly effective and stable macro-spherical catalyst for aqueous environmental catalysis. The preparation scheme here can be also applied to fabricate other versatile macrosphere-supported metal complex catalysts.

The transformation of nanocubes to nanocages and mixed metal-oxide is thoroughly characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques and employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (OER and ORR, respectively) in which NiFe-oxide proved to be the best bifunctional catalyst.

In this study, we develop a selective methanol adsorbent, manganese hexacyanocobaltate (MnHCC), which enables the efficient removal of methanol from waste gas and its subsequent reuse. MnHCC adsorbs 4.8 mmol-methanol/g-adsorbent at 25 degrees C in a humid gas containing 5000 ppmv of methanol, which is five times higher than the adsorption capacity of activated carbon (0.86 mmol/ g). Although MnHCC exhibits the simultaneous adsorption of methanol and water, it has a higher adsorption enthalpy for methanol. Thus, pure methanol (95%) was recovered via thermal desorption at 150 degrees C after dehydration. The estimated energy of this recovery was 18.9 MJ/kg-methanol, approximately half that of existing mass production methods. MnHCC is reusable and stable even after 10 cyclic experiments. Consequently, MnHCC has the potential to contribute to both the recycling of methanol from waste gas and its lowcost purification.

Recently, cobalt-based PBAs have been acknowledged as efficient and robust water oxidation catalysts. Given the flexibility in their synthesis, the structure and morphology of cobalt-based PBAs have been modified for enhanced catalytic activity under electrochemical (EC), photocatalytic (PC), and photoelectrochemical (PEC) conditions. Here, in this review, the work on cobalt-based PBAs is presented in four sections: i) electrocatalytic water oxidation with bare PBAs, ii) photocatalytic processes in the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), iii) photoelectrochemical water oxidation by coupling PBAs to proper semiconductors (SCs), and iv) the utilization of PBA-PS assemblies coated on SCs for the dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This review will guide readers through the structure and catalytic activity relationship in cobalt-based PBAs by describing the role of each structural component. Furthermore, this review aims to provide insight into common strategies to enhance the catalytic activity of PBAs.

Then, the Fe2O3/CC material was obtained by the subsequent high-temperature calcination of PB/CC. This is the first example of composites based on CC and PB (or PB analogues)-derived metal oxides. The resulting Fe2O3/CC composite can be employed directly as binder-free anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting superior electrochemical performances to pure CC and Fe2O3. The mass specific capacity of Fe2O3/CC was about 395mAhg(-1) (an areal capacity of 5.1mAhcm(-2)) at 100mAg(-1) with almost no decay after 135 discharge/charge cycles. The outstanding lithium storage properties of Fe2O3/CC benefit from the synergistic interaction between CC and Fe2O3.

Monte Carlo simulation study for hysteresis properties of a Prussian blue analog nanowire	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER												We have studied the hysteresis loops and hysteresis related properties (like coercivity, remanence and saturation magnetization) of a cylindrical ternary alloy Prussian blue analog nanowire of the type AB(x)C(1-x) by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We consider a ferromagnetic coupling between type-A and and type-B magnetic components (J(AB) > 0) and an antiferromagnetic coupling between type-A and and type-C magnetic components (J(AC) < 0). By defining exchange interaction ratio, R = vertical bar J(AC)vertical bar/J(AB), we have shown that for special values of R and concentration x, nanowire displays a minimum value of coercive field which is attributed to the existence of compensation behavior in the system. Moreover, minimum values of remanent magnetization are observed for x values at which the positive and negative magnetization components are about to balance each other. Finally, temperature dependence of coercivity and remanence are investigated in a wide temperature range.

In this work, nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) loaded on nickel foam (NF) was used as a self-sacrificing template for subsequent growth of nickel-iron Prussian blue (NiFe-PBA) hollow nanocubes on its sheet arrays. The triple-scale porous structure is therefore in-situ constructed in the produced NiFe-PBA@LDH/NF catalyst, where NiFe-PBA nanocubes, NiFe-LDH sheets and NF skeletons provide pores at hundred-nanometers, microns and hundred-microns, respectively. Due to the successful construction of hierarchical mass transfer channels in the catalyst, the overpotential required to deliver 1000 mA cm-2 OER is only 396 mV, which is 80 mV lower than that of NiFe-LDH/NF with a double-scale porous structure, manifesting the importance of the appropriate mass transfer channels, promoting the potential application of the NiFe-PBA@LDH/NF catalyst in industrial-scale electrolysers.					孙, 世新/HFZ-1643-2022; Cai, Weiwei/J-4049-2012; Xu, Guodong/G-6250-2014	Sun, Shi-Xin/0000-0002-1654-5529; Xu, Guodong/0000-0002-0202-145X													0021-9797	1095-7103				APR	2024	659						40	47		10.1016/j.jcis.2023.12.138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2023.12.138		DEC 2023						38157725					WOS:001166023600001

Due to their tunability, intrinsic biocompatibility, as well as low toxicity, these nanoscale coordination polymers have been successfully studied as multimodal contrast agents for multiple imaging techniques. Herein, we report the expanded biomedical application of PBAs to X-ray computed tomography (CT). In our systematic study of the series A{Mn-II[ Fe-III(CN)6]} (A = K+, Rb+, Cs+), we showed that derivatives incorporating Rb+ and Cs+ ions in the tetrahedral sites of the parent face-centered cubic cyano-bridged networks exhibited substantially increased X-ray attenuation coefficients, thus yielding significant contrast compared to the clinically approved X-ray contrast agent iohexol at the same concentrations. Additionally, our mu-CT studies revealed that these PBAs could be useful as dual-energy CT contrast agents for different biological specimens by using the lower varying scanning X-ray tube voltages. Finally, in vitro studies using U87-Luc cells treated with PBAs, including cellular CT imaging and bioluminescence cell viability assays, revealed that PBAs were taken up by the glioblastoma cells, with moderate biocompatibility at concentrations below the mM range.

Innovative pH-dependent approach for electrochemical determination of a triple eradication therapy targeting H. Pylori infection in pharmaceutical formulation and human plasma sample: Modified electrode with Prussian blue analogue decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PbA@MWCNT)	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL												In the present study, a sensitive and cost-effective voltammetric method was developed, optimized and applied for assessment of a new combination of a triple therapy treatment that contain tinidazole (TZ), clarithromycin (CLR) and lansoprazole (LAN) depending on different pH effect. The study was developed using electrode of carbon paste improved by Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles in addition to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PbA-NPs/MWCNT/CPE). The characterization and morphology of the nanoparticles composite was studied for the adopted electrode by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Effect of different electrodes and content of PbA-NPs on the voltammetric perfor-mance of the three drugs were assessed. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was estimated and linear corre-lations were then obtained in the range of 0.01-0.9, 1.0-10.0 and 0.5-12.0 mu g/mL for LAN, CLR and TZ, respectively. The optimized method has been validated as per the ICH guidelines and found to be appropriate for the routine quality control of the studied drugs in their pharmaceutical formulation in addition to spiked human plasma. Consequently, the proposed method definitely provides an efficient, beneficial, reliable and cost-effective tool for estimation of the cited active pharmaceutical ingredients.

The introduction of N-rGO used as a template effectively prevented agglomeration of NiCoSe4 nanoparticles and provided more active sites, which greatly increased the electrochemical and electrical conductivity for NiCoSe4/N-rGO. NiCoSe4/N-rGO-20 presents a remarkably elevated specific capacity of 120 mA h g(-1) under current density of 1 A g(-1). NiCoSe4/N-rGO-20 demonstrates an excellent cycle life and achieves a remarkable 83% retention rate over 3000 cycles with 10 A g(-1). NiCoSe4/N-rGO-20//N-rGO asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed based on the NiCoSe4/N-rGO-20 as an anode, N-rGO as cathode by using 2 mol l(-1) KOH as an electrolyte. NiCoSe4/N-rGO-20//N-rGO ASC demonstrates an ultra-big energy density of 14 Wh kg(-1) and good circulation stability in the power density of 902 W kg(-1). It is doubled in comparison to the NiCoSe4/N-rGO-20//rGO asymmetric supercapacitor (7 Wh kg(-1)). The NiCoSe4/N-rGO-20//N-rGO ASC capacity retention is still up to 93% over 5000 cycles (5 A g(-1)). The results reveal that this device would be a prospective cathode material of supercapacitors in actual applications.

Herein, efficient removal of toxic organic pollutants 3-AP (Amino-phenol) and FA (Fuschin acid dye) by MHCC@rGO has been reported. The prominent peaks in Powder X-Ray Diffraction spectra confirms crystalline nature while Scanning electron microscopy established an average particle size (20-35 nm) with deformed spherical nanoparticles of MHCC@rGO. The photocatalytic efficiency of MHCC@rGO (M = Ni, Zn) for removal of FA dye and 3-AP was subsequently studied by optimizing various reaction parameters such as pollutant concentration.: 50-100 mg L-1, Catalyst dose: 5-25 mg; pH: 3-12 and different source of irradiation. The NiHCC@rGO nanocomposite shows the highest removal of pollutants (FA: 98 % in 90 min and 3-AP: 80 % in 135 min) when exposed to sunlight (500 +/- 170 lx,), at the 50 mg L-1 pollutant concentration at neutral pH, supported by its small size, more negative zeta potential (-23.9 mV), and narrow bandgap (1.85 eV). According to scavenger studies, OH radicals are essential for disintegrating the intricate structure of 3-AP and FA. Safer metabolites emerged after degradation, confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (LCMS) analysis. Consequently, the MHCC@rGO nanohybrid is an effective catalyst with a broad range of industrial applications due to its exceptional stability, affordability, increased reusability (n = 9), and increased charge separation.

Herein, hollow Prussian blue analog@defect-rich layered double hydroxide S-scheme heterojunctions are successfully obtained by two-sept etching strategies. Firstly, the hollow Prussian blue analog (H-PBA) is formed by ammonia etching. Subsequently, ZIF-67 is uniformly grown on the H-PBA surface and formed into defect-rich layered double hydroxide (D-LDH) nanocages by ion exchange. This hollow core-shell structure of H-PBA@D-LDH enables the photocatalyst to have more active sites. Meanwhile, in-situ XPS and the work function revealed the direction of electron transfer, providing evidence for the formation of S-scheme heterojunctions. In addition, transient photoluminescence and photoelectrochemical tests confirmed that the H-PBA@D-LDH S-scheme heterojunctions had longer charge lifetimes and enhanced photoelectrochemical properties. The presence of photothermal effect increases the temperature of the H-PBA@D-LDH composite system, which promotes the photocatalytic process. As a result, the H-PBA@D-LDH S-scheme heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic degradation efficiency and hydrogen production rate (260.320 mu mol h-1), which were several times higher than those of H-PBA and D-LDH. This work provides a new idea for the design of S-scheme photocatalysts.

Through the variation of the organization of the pores, the metal loading and the chemical composition of the solid matrix, it was possible to modify independently the aggregation state, the dilution and the chemical environment of the nanoparticles and to disentangle the effect of each parameter on the physical properties. The approach was first assessed by using the versatile platform to study the effect of size reduction on the magnetic properties of Prussian blue analogues, which were highly sensitive to dilution effects. Then, the approach was applied to photomagnetic nanoparticles. The photomagnetic effect in particles of nanometric dimensions is due to the photoinduced Co-III(LS) Fe-II -> Co-II(HS) Fe-III electron transfer (LS = low spin, HS = high spin). The photomagnetic properties of nanoparticles are relatively insensitive to dilution effects, but the thermal relaxation of the photoexcited state is sensitive to the chemical environment of the nanoparticles.

However, water molecules typically contained within PB structures have been hypothesized to undermine their stability and rate performance. Here we report that zeolite water molecules in PB structures may induce the formation of Na2CO3 as one of the main components in SEI layer on the surface of PB materials. From PB samples containing zeolite water synthesized via a solvothermal method at different temperatures, a specific capacity of 113 mAh g(-1) is demonstrated at 10 mA g(-1), with a capacity retention of 75% at 1000 mA g(-1). Cycling tests reveal a capacity loss of only 1.2% after 100 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). It is suggested that Na2CO3 contained in the SEI layer not only protects the electrode materials from side reactions with the electrolyte, but also facilitates quick charge transfer at the interfaces, leading to improved electrochemical performances.

PBAs have a high potential for applications in scientific investigations, industry, ecology and medicine. Being stable and both catalytically and electrochemically active, PBAs are promising in the construction of biosensors and biofuel cells. The "green" synthesis of PO-like PBAs using oxido-reductase flavocytochrome b(2) is described in this study. When immobilized on graphite electrodes (GEs), the obtained green-synthesized PBAs or hexacyanoferrates (gHCFs) of transition and noble metals produced amperometric signals in response to H2O2. HCFs of copper, iron, palladium and other metals were synthesized and characterized by structure, size, catalytic properties and electro-mediator activities. The gCuHCF, as the most effective PO mimetic with a flower-like micro/nano superstructure, was used as an H2O2-sensitive platform for the development of a glucose oxidase (GO)-based biosensor.

However, severe capacity fading and poor K+ diffusion kinetics greatly limit its large-scale application. Herein, we propose a facile anion exchange method to construct Mn-Ni Prussian blue analogue (denoted MnNi-PBA) spheres. The introduction of Ni can stabilize the structure to enhance the cycling performance, and rich active sites can be provided by the formation of a unique porous spherical structure, thus enabling shorter ion diffusion pathways during charge/discharge. Consequently, the MnNi-PBA sphere cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 130.6 mAh g(-1) at 10 mA g(-1), an enhanced rate capability of 66.3 mAh(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), and a long cycle life with 83.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles. When assembled with a pitch-derived soft carbon anode, a full cell exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate performance. In addition, ex situ X-ray diffraction demonstrates that the MnNi-PBA spheres undergo reversible structural changes (monoclinic <-> cubic) throughout the cycling process. Therefore, this work may offer a design strategy to synthesize Mn-based Prussian blue analogues for the application of PIBs.

Nevertheless, the catalytic efficiency of the nanozyme still needs to be improved so that it can meet the stability and sensitivity requirements of continuous biological detection. We presented an effective tailoring strategy to enhance the enzyme-like activities of Prussian-blue-analog-based nanozymes. Molybdenum-polysulfide-deposited nickel-iron bi- metal Prussian-blue-analog-based hollow nanocages (Nanocages) with peroxidase-, catalase-, and lactase-mimicking activities were synthesized. The doping of molybdenum successfully tailored the size, morphology, composition, and complex structure of the Nanocage, and the peroxidase- and lactase-mimicking activities of the Nanocage nanozyme were enhanced by over 37 and 27 times, respectively, compared with pristine Prussian blue analogs. Moreover, in environments of harsh pH, high temperature, and high salt concentration, Nanocages exhibited much higher stability than natural enzymes. The peroxidase- and catalase-mimicking activities were applied to eliminate reactive oxygen species in cells, whereas the laccase-like activity of Nanocages was integrated with an online sensing platform for in vivo and continuous optical hydrogen sulfide monitoring in the brains of living rats. Our findings may provide possibilities for advancing the design strategy of highly active nanozymes as well as nanozyme-based in vivo detection methods and will offer unique opportunities for their involvement in bioanalytical chemistry.

In this work, a series of novel Ce-Fe bimetallic oxides (CFO) were synthesized by the pyrolysis of Ce-Fe Prussian blue precursors (Ce-Fe PBAs), which shows excellent ability for the photodegradation of tetracycline (TC). The Ce-Fe Prussian blue precursors with corn-like, coral-like and snowflake shapes were obtained by coprecipitation method and its shape could be controlled by adjusting the synthesis temperature and the molar ratio of Ce3+/[Fe(CN)(6)](4-). The systematical characterization results show that the CFO presents porous structure, with homogeneous dispersion of both metals and abundant oxygen vacancies. The corn-like CFO synthesized at room-temperature (20 degrees C) with 1:1 molar ratio has the largest specific surface area and the strongest photocurrent response. The TC could be photodegraded over 86% within 90 min under visible light by CFO. The mechanism studies verified the generation and intensity of (OH)-O-center dot and O-center dot(2)- playing a key role in the degradation of TC. This synthetic technology can pave the way for developing more active complex metal oxide for the treatment of antibiotic contamination.					yang, juan/MIP-9642-2025; Zhang, Lili/ABH-2315-2021; Mo, Zhao/AAP-4601-2020; yin, jingzhou/X-6452-2019; Qin, hanli/JVZ-4582-2024; Liu, Qinqin/A-1807-2019; Li, Yuxin/K-9197-2016	Mo, Zhao/0000-0001-5824-3281													2213-2929	2213-3437				DEC	2021	9	6							106739	10.1016/j.jece.2021.106739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2021.106739		NOV 2021											WOS:000720824700005

Herein, MnFe PBA/rGO composite was prepared by simple coprecipitation and in situ synthesis, and realized the fast kinetics and superior stability for sodium storage. The rGO nanosheets were introduced as the framework to encapsulate the MnFe PBA nanocuboids with uniform particle size and welldefined configuration to further enhance their electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties. The prepared MnFe PBA/rGO composite exhibits superior charge/discharge properties than the pristine MnFe PBA nanocuboids, which show a capacity enhancement of over 30%. In addition, the PBA/rGO composite exhibits excellent cycling stability, which retains 80% of the capacity after 1000 cycles at a high rate of 1 A/g. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results further demonstrate the low resistance, high durability, and ultrahigh stability of the MnFe PBA/rGO composite during high-rate long-term cycling. Therefore, this work not only provides a high-performance sodium host but also gives a new clue to the design and construction of highly efficient electrode materials for advanced electrochemical systems.					deng, chao/AAP-3978-2021														0167-577X	1873-4979				SEP 1	2024	370								136850	10.1016/j.matlet.2024.136850	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2024.136850		JUN 2024											WOS:001258535800001

Water driven phase transitions in Prussian white cathode materials	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-ENERGY												Prussian white (PW, Na2Fe [Fe(CN)(6)] center dot zH(2)O) is a promising cathode material for use in sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage applications, which demand long cycling life-times. However, for non-aqueous battery applications PW must not contain any water, and yet dehydration induces a large volume change destabilizing the structure and reducing the cycling life. The material undergoes multiple phase transitions as a function of both the sodium and water content, however, the mechanism behind is poorly understood. Here, we use neutron diffraction to explore the influence of water on the structure of PW. For the first time, two structures for a single composition of PW were observed near room temperature independent of the synthesis method. These structures differ in the FeN6 and FeC6 octahedral tilting configurations, which is connected to the ordering of water in the framework. The removal of water modulates the magnitude of pre-existing structural distortions, if it is itself disordered within the structure, rather than modifying the nature of the distortions. These results provide a robust fundamental understanding of the chemical driving force impacting the nature and magnitude of structural distortions in Prussian blue analogues. The insights provide guidance for designing tilt-engineering ultimately enabling new materials with enhanced long-term electrochemical performance in battery applications.

Herein, we innovatively synthesize a superlight Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue microcube/graphene aerogel (Ni-Co PBA/GA) monolith by hydrothermal reaction and freeze-drying. Compared to individual graphene aerogels, Ni-Co PBA/GA displays better impedance matching and multiple mechanisms for attenuating EMWs. Resultantly, Ni-Co PBA/GA presents outstanding EMW absorption performance, whose minimum refection loss is -62.3 dB at 13.3 GHz and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 5.6 GHz. With the detection Phi of 0 degrees, the simulated radar cross-section reduction of Ni-Co PBA/GA reaches -36.8 dB m2, demonstrating the potential radar-evading ability in the actual far field. Ni-Co PBA/GA may be a promising candidate for a superlight, ecofriendly and high-performance EMW absorption material in the future.

Due to its advanced catalysis, biocompatibility, selectivity and stability, PB has been widely used in biosensor construction. However, the formation of regular PB nanostructures is challenging due to its fast crystallization rate. Recently, developments in this research area have increased due to emerging novel synthesis methods in nanoscale technology. Various regular nanostructures of PB films that show superior biosensing performance have been prepared. In this review, recent research progress in PB nanostructures is summarized, with special emphasis on the methodology of nanostructure control. The mechanism and key factors in regular PB crystallization are also discussed for each synthesis method. The performance of PB nanostructure-based biosensors is compared with others to show the advantages of nanostructure control. The methodology discussed in this review not only include the regular growth of PB films, but also provides information on the nanostructure control of more crystalline materials, including PB analogues, noble metals, metal oxides and coordination compounds. In addition to biosensing applications and the development of more advanced nanostructures, PB has also shown increased advanced properties in other scientific areas.

The extended structural and surface characterization demonstrated good reproducibility of the preparation procedures performed on a 10-g scale. The adsorbents were tested under dynamic conditions of gas flow with the aid of either a gas flow calorimeter (120 mL h(-1) helium flow) to measure the amount and rate of the integral heat release or a laboratory-scale test rig (15,000 to 22,800 mL h(-1) nitrogen flow) to monitor the outlet temperature of nitrogen heated by adsorption. For a regeneration temperature of 353 K and a partial H2O pressure of 2.8 kPa in helium, the PBA sample yielded an integral heat ranging between 900 and 1020 kJ kg(-1) with a very slow heat release lasting for even 12-14 h. The zeolite-based materials generated between 350 and 950 kJ kg(-1) more rapidly (up to 6-7 h), depending on the nature and the content of compensating cations, as well as on the dehydration state achieved during regeneration. With the laboratory-scale test rig, the efficiency of heat extraction by convection was about 65% for Na-13X and only 38% for PBA, and it diminished with decreasing flow rate.

Here, we propose a modification strategy of a polyaniline (PANI) coating on zinc ferricyanide (ZnHCF). The PANI coating inhibits the dissolution of ZnHCF and enables the Zn-ion battery to present two long-flat discharge voltage platforms as well as a high capacity of 150 mA h g(-1), which provides a new idea for the development of high-performance PBA battery materials.

PB acts as a superior catalyst for the oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome by H2O2. The oxidation of dopamine by H2O2 in the presence of PB is 6-fold faster than in the presence of CuFe. The cluster FeCo does not catalyze the oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome. The most efficient catalyst for the generation of chemiluminescence by the oxidation of luminol by H2O2 is, however, FeCo, and PB lacks any catalytic activity toward the generation of chemiluminescence. The order of catalyzed chemiluminescence generation is FeCo >> CuFe > FeCoFe. The clusters PB, CuFe, FeCoFe, and FeCo mimic the functions of NADH peroxidase. The catalyzed oxidation of NADH by H2O2 to form NAD(+) follows the order PB >> CuFe similar to FeCoFe, FeCo. The efficient generation of chemiluminescence by the FeCo-catalyzed oxidation of luminol by H2O2 is used to develop a glucose sensor.

Among them, copper nitroprusside, Cu[Fe(CN)(5)NO], has recently been investigated for its peculiar redox system, which also involves the nitrosyl ligand as a non-innocent ligand, in addition to the electroactivity of the metal sites, Cu and Fe. This paper studies the dynamics of the electrode, employing surface sensitive X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and bulk sensitive X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques. XPS provided chemical information on the layers formed on electrode surfaces following the self-discharge process of the cathode material in the presence of the electrolyte. These layers consist mainly of electrolyte degradation products, such as LiF, Li(x)PO(y)Fz and LixPFy. Moreover, as evidenced by XAS and XPS, reduction at both metal sites takes place in the bulk and in the surface of the material, clearly evidencing that a self-discharge process is occurring. We observed faster processes and higher amounts of reduced species and decomposition products in the case of samples with a higher amount of coordination water.

Searching for suitable electrode materials is one of the most important jobs in preparing high-performance batteries. In this work, we report a one-step hydrothermal method to successfully synthesize novel K-V-Fe Prussian blue analogues nanocubes (PBAs NCs) by using oxalic acid as the reducing agent. The obtained electrode materials effectively combine the high electrochemical activity of vanadium-contained ions with the excellent structural stability of Prussian blue frame, thus ensuring their high capacity for electrochemical energy storage and excellent cycling stability. The optimal K-V-Fe PBAs NCs can achieve a high specific capacity of 92.85 mAh.g(-1) at a current density of 2 A.g(-1), outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 91.44% (84.9 mAh.g(-1)) after 2000 cycles at 2 A.g(-1) and good rate capability with a specific capacity of 46.2 mAh.g(-1) at 5 A.g(-1). This strategy of combine vanadium element with open three-dimensional framework provides a new way for selecting and improving electrode materials suitable for electrochemical energy storage. And the present K-V-Fe PBAs NCs will be a promising candidate for aqueous rechargeable ammonium-ion batteries due to their high capacity, reasonable cost and excellent cycling stability.

Recently, researchers have been able to prepare molecular fragments of these networks using a building block synthetic approach from mononuclear precursors. The main objective in this strategy is to isolate the smallest units that show an intramolecular electron transfer to have a better understanding of the electronic processes. A prior requirement to the development of this kind of system is to understand to what extent electronic and magnetic properties are inherited from the corresponding precursors. In this work, we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of the FeTp precursor (N(C4H9)(4))[TpFe(III)(CN)(3)], (Tp being tris-pyrazolyl borate) of a recently reported binuclear cyanido-bridged Fe/Co complex. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements at the Fe L-2,L-3 edges (2p -> 3d) supported by ligand field multiplet calculations have allowed to determine the spin and orbit magnetic moments. Inaccuracy of the spin sum rule in the case of low-spin Fe-III ion was demonstrated. An exceptionally large value of the orbital magnetic moment is found (0.9 mu(B) at T = 2 K and B = 6.5 T) that is likely to play an important role in the magnetic and photomagnetic properties of molecular Fe/Co Prussian blue analogues.

The conductive flexible thin film based on PB were prepared with electrochemical deposition from acidic solution containing a mixture ferric and ferricyanide ions and characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analyses. The electrochemical performance of the flexible PB thin film is evaluated in 0.1 M KNO3 liquid electrolyte medium using the Cyclic Voltammetry method. A sensitive method of design in the non-enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensor is attained as the decrease in current by increasing glucose concentration. The electrochemical response of the prepared flexible thin film is the limit of detection is 0.4 mu M (S/N = 3), and the sensitivity is 2.46 mu A/mM cm(2). The regression square value is 0.9982.

Commercial conductive filaments have been widely used due to their easiness of acquisition ready for application, and the possibility of surface modification. Generally, these filaments are composed of polymers and conductive material. However, it can present different compositions according to the manufacturing, which includes other additives and impurities. Iron has been reported as one of these impurities in conductive filaments based on polylactic acid and graphene. In this case, we have explored the presence of iron species for the electrochemical synthesis of stable nanoparticles of Prussian blue on 3D printed graphene electrodes. Prussian blue was used for the catalyst and electro-oxidation of L-cysteine amino acid, which is a biomarker related to several health problems and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. An arrangement of all 3D printed electrodes was used and presented comparable results to a conventional electrodes array. Also, the proposed sensors have shown good sensitivity, selectivity in presence of other amino acids, repeatability, and intra-day reproducibility for L-cysteine detection, compared to other 3D printed sensors obtained at different ages. The detection of L-cysteine was performed in spiked human blood serum samples, demonstrating no significant matrix interference.

The reaction of K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] and Na-2[Fe(CN)(5)(NO)] with Co(OH)(2)@CC produced precatalysts PC-1 and PC-2, respectively, with distinct structural and electronic features. The replacement of the -CN group with strong pi-acceptor -NO modulates the electronic and atomic structure of PC-2. As a result, a facile electrochemical transformation of PC-2 into active catalyst Fe-Co(OH)(2)-Co(O)OH (AC-2) has been attained only in 15 CV cycles while 600 CV cycles are required for the electrochemical activation of PC-1 into AC-1. The X-ray absorption studies reveal the contraction of the Co-O and Fe-O bond in AC-2 because of the presence of a higher amount of Co3+ and Fe3+ than in AC-1. The high valent Co3+ and Fe3+ modulates the electronic properties of AC-2 and assists in the O-O bond formation, leading to the improved water oxidation activity.

Herein, we fabricated the series of nitrogen doped carbon (NC) and CoFe-NC core-shell architectures to produce dual-functionality towards oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and ultimately for Zn-air battery. The addition of NC tends to prevent the reduction of Co/Fe nanoparticles during pyrolysis which not only provide improved catalytic sites but also boost the specific surface area, graphitization degree, electron and mass transfer capacity. With distinctive core-shell morphology, the as synthesized CoFe-NC/NC shows superior OER performance with low overpotential (270 mV) than IrO2 (340 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) and nearly close ORR activity with respect to Pt/C. When fabricated as zinc air battery application, CoFe-NC/NC shows 58 mW cm(-2) higher peak power density than that of air cathodes made of Pt/C and IrO2. Further, our catalyst shows good durability due to the synergistic effect of Fe/Co and NC shell. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Organotrialkoxysilane-Functionalized Prussian Blue Nanoparticles-Mediated Fluorescence Sensing of Arsenic(III)	NANOMATERIALS												Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBN) exhibit selective fluorescence quenching behavior with heavy metal ions; in addition, they possess characteristic oxidant properties both for liquid-liquid and liquid-solid interface catalysis. Here, we propose to study the detection and efficient removal of toxic arsenic(III) species by materializing these dual functions of PBN. A sophisticated PBN-sensitized fluorometric switching system for dosage-dependent detection of As3+ along with PBN-integrated SiO2 platforms as a column adsorbent for biphasic oxidation and elimination of As3+ have been developed. Colloidal PBN were obtained by a facile two-step process involving chemical reduction in the presence of 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyl trimethoxysilane (EETMSi) and cyclohexanone as reducing agents, while heterogeneous systems were formulated via EETMSi, which triggered in situ growth of PBN inside the three-dimensional framework of silica gel and silica nanoparticles (SiO2). PBN-induced quenching of the emission signal was recorded with an As3+ concentration (0.05-1.6 ppm)-dependent fluorometric titration system, owing to the potential excitation window of PBN (at 480-500 nm), which ultimately restricts the radiative energy transfer. The detection limit for this arrangement is estimated around 0.025 ppm. Furthermore, the mesoporous and macroporous PBN-integrated SiO2 arrangements might act as stationary phase in chromatographic studies to significantly remove As3+. Besides physisorption, significant electron exchange between Fe3+/Fe2+ lattice points and As3+ ions enable complete conversion to less toxic As5+ ions with the repeated influx of mobile phase.

In this study, we introduce a hydroxylation method to enhance the energy storage capabilities of Co2CuMn-PBAs in aqueous zinc-ion capacitors. The modified Co2CuMn-PBA electrode exhibits enhanced capacitance and rate performance, demonstrating an remarkable reversible capacitance of 232.2F/g at 0.1A/g and a rate capacitance of 85.6F/g at 2 A/g, thus positioning it as a promising cathode material for supercapacitors.

Realizing their full potential, however, is not without challenges. One is that among the limited choices of cathode materials, the more sustainable Prussian blue analogues suffer from fast capacity fading when manganese is present. Here we report a potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate K1.82Mn[Fe(CN)(6)](0.96)center dot 0.47H(2)O cathode featuring an in situ cation engineered surface where iron is substituted for manganese. With this engineered surface, the cathode design exhibits a discharge capacity of 160 mAh g(-1) and 120 mAh g(-1) at 300 mA g(-1) and 2,500 mA g(-1), respectively, and sustains 130,000 cycles (more than 500 days) with negligible capacity loss. Pairing the current cathode with a 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide anode yields a full potassium-ion cell that delivers an energy density as high as 92 Wh kg(-1) and retains 82.5% of the initial capacity after 6,500 cycles at 1,500 mA g(-1). The unprecedented electrochemical performance could be attributed to the suppressed manganese dissolution as a result of the shielding surface layer. This work may open an avenue for the rational design of high-performance cathode materials with redox-active manganese for rechargeable batteries. Aqueous potassium-ion batteries have emerged as a more sustainable technology to complement lithium-ion counterparts. Ge et al. engineer the surface of a potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate cathode material, achieving unprecedented electrochemical performance in full K-ion cells.

J	Lim, CQX; Tan, ZK				Lim, Cheryldine Q. X.; Tan, Zhi-Kuang			Prussian White with Near-Maximum Specific Capacity in Sodium-Ion Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS												Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues are promising materials for sodium-ion battery cathodes because of their high working potentials, high theoretical capacity, and low toxicity. Prussian white (PW), which is the fully reduced and sodiated form of PB, could significantly improve the manufacturability of commercial batteries as it circumvents the requirement of a reactive sodium-loaded anode in cell assembly. However, previous preparations of PW require a high-temperature, high-pressure, and oxygen-free environment, and their reported performance in battery cathodes have been modest so far. Here, we report a mild, low-temperature synthesis of PW, using a common sodium borohydride reducing agent in our reaction. We achieved PW with a remarkably high specific capacity of 169 +/- 4 mA h/g at 1C in a sodium-ion half-cell battery, which is near the theoretical maximum capacity of 171 mA h/g. Complete full-cell batteries with near-maximum capacities were also demonstrated as proof-of-concept. The attainment of this high specific capacity is attributed to the successful preservation of Na+ intercalation sites in the fully sodiated material during a critical heat-vacuum-drying step in our process. These findings, and the significant advancement in performance, mark an important step toward the future deployment of sodium-ion rechargeable batteries in consumer electronic devices.

For large-scale applications, cathode materials with low-cost and long cycle life are preferred. However, only a few of the review papers have concentrated on the detailed analysis of low-cost PBAs, including Fe-based and Mn-based PBAs, which also show excellent electrochemical performance. This review aims to first provide an all-sided understanding of low-cost PBAs in terms of their application and recent progress in MIBs. Then, the major challenges such as inferior electrochemical properties of low-cost PBAs are discussed. Meanwhile, we provide feasible strategies to prepare PBA electrodes with advanced electrochemical performance. Finally, we present some personal perspectives and guidance for future research, aiming to narrow the gap between laboratory investigation and practical application.

In this study, the oxygen plasma-activated hybrid structure of Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) interconnected by carbon nanotubes (O-CNT/NiFe) is reported as a highly effective electrocatalytic material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytic performance is significantly influenced by different mass ratios of CNTs to Ni-Fe PBA. Benefiting from the conductive and oxygen plasma-activated CNTs as well as ordered and distributed metal sites in the framework, the optimized O-CNT/NiFe 1:18 exhibits a competitive overpotential of 279 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 42.8 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, the composite shows superior durability for at least 100 h. These results suggest that the O-CNT/NiFe 1:18 possesses promising potential as a highly active electrocatalyst.

Herein, preparation of trimetallic PBA containing copper, cobalt, and iron with a nanoframe superstructure (CuCoFePBA NFs) via a multi-step in-situ structural conversion is reported. Comparable experiments indicate that successful conversion via this route is attributable to a selftemplated epitaxial growth triggered by the additional introduction of Cu ions into the reaction system. The optimal composition and three-dimensional (3D) opened nanoframe structure of CuCoFe-PBA NFs offer the electrode with rich redox active species, abundant accessible adsorption sites, and fast ion transport that enhance its capacitive deionization (CDI) performance. As a result, the CuCoFe-PBA NFs demonstrate an exceptional CDI performance with a desalination capacity of 46.8 mg g- 1 at an applied potential of 1.4 V and superior cyclability with negligible decay on the desalination capacity even after 100 cycle test.

This study reports the successful synthesis of a novel ZnFe2O4 derivative based on Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) through an electrosynthesis method. To enhance photocatalytic performance, the synthesized ZnFe2O4 was employed as a cocatalyst in p-n junction materials, specifically CuO/ZnFe2O4. Our findings reveal that introducing ZnFe2O4 could significantly improve the photocatalytic activity and hydrogen (H-2) production rate of the CuO/ZnFe2O4 system compared to bare CuO. This enhancement was sustained over an extended operational period, indicating the material's potential for long-term use in photocatalytic applications. The superior performance of the ZnFe2O4 cocatalyst is attributed to its efficient charge separation and improved light absorption properties, which collectively contribute to higher photocatalytic efficiency. This study highlights the potential of PBA-based derivative ZnFe2O4 as an effective cocatalyst in developing advanced photocatalytic systems for sustainable hydrogen production.

High-entropy Prussian blue analogs (HE-PBAs) are promising insertion-type battery materials due to their diverse composition, high structural integrity, and favorable ionic conductivity. This work proposes a non-volatile, bipolar memristor based on HE-PBA. The device, featuring an active layer of HE-PBA sandwiched between Ag and ITO electrodes, is fabricated by inkjet printing and microplotting. The conduction mechanism of the Ag/HE-PBA/ITO device is systematically investigated. The results indicate that the transition between HRS and LRS is driven by an insulating-metallic transition, triggered by extraction/insertion of highly mobile Na+ ions upon application of an electric field. The memristor operates through a low-energy process akin to Na+ shuttling in Na-ion batteries rather than depending on formation/rupture of Ag filaments. Notably, it showcases promising characteristics, including non-volatility, self-compliance, and forming-free behavior, and further exhibits low operation voltage (VSET = -0.26 V, VRESET = 0.36 V), low power consumption (PSET = 26 mu W, PRESET = 8.0 mu W), and a high ROFF/RON ratio of 104. This underscores the potential of high-entropy insertion materials for developing printed memristors with distinct operation mechanisms.

The addition of cellulose during the formation of Prussian blue analogs reduced the agglomeration of metal particles in the subsequent carbonization process, thus increasing the specific surface area and enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the obtained catalyst.O- 1(2) and the electron transfer pathway were proved to be the main mechanisms by radical quenching experiment, electron paramagnetic resonance and chronoamperometry analysis. The metal leaching of lower than 0.1 mg L-1 and high catalytic stability were attributed to the stable core-shell structure that the metals were encapsulated and protected by graphene shells. The XPS analysis implied that a Fe/Mn redox cycle existed and played a role in balancing electrons during the PMS activation. This study shows that the PMS activator with high catalytic activity can be obtained for the degradation of pollutants by combining Prussian blue analogs with cellulose.

The number of 3d electrons and the magnetic orbitals have been varied on both sites of t h e bimetallic cyanide polymer by combi n i n g with the hexacyanoferrate or the hexacyanochromate entities' various divalent metal ions A2+ (Mn2+ , Fe2+, Co2+ , Ni2+ , and Cu2+). These PBA were studied by Fe and Cr X-ray absorption spectroscopy and XMCD. The results, compared to those obtained at the A K-edges in a previous work, show that transition-metal K-edge XMCD is very sensitive to orbital symmetry and can therefore give valuable information on the local structure of the magnetic centers. Expressions of the intensity of the main 1s -> 4p contribution to the signal are proposed for all K-edges and all compounds.

However, existing detection methods are time-consuming and complex to industrial production and quality testing. Here, we proposed a core-shell nanowires constructed electrochemical sensor to achieve the highly sensitive and selective recognition of AA with a long-term reusability. Cu nanowires with 30 nm diameter were served as both structure skeleton and reactant to induce in-situ growth of Cu-Fe Prussian blue layer with 10 nm thickness covering its surface to form a core-shell architecture. This nanocomposite couples advances of Cu and Prussian blue to possess both high electrocatalysis and conductivity. The as-prepared sensor shows an excellent sensitivity with an ultrawide linear range, together with the remarkable reusable ability during 30 days with 300 times of repetitive detection. Used for four kinds of juice and bear as real samples, this sensor can accurately reported AA concentration within 5 s.

Sample tubes containing an agar gel mixed with 0.10M CoCl2 solution and a water-glass gel mixed with 0.05M K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]/K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] solution were prepared for the analyses. Dark-purple continuous (DPC) bands were observed in the water-glass gel of the two tubes. XRF results demonstrated that the DPC bands contained diffusive Co-Fe complexes. XANES results indicated that the Fe and Co local structures in the DPC bands were independent of the initial Fe oxidation states in [Fe(CN)(6)] and the measurement positions. It was found that the Fe local structure of the DPC bands was predominantly [Fe(CN)(6)]. The real-space multiple scattering calculations using FEFF 8.02 code suggested that Co-Fe-based Prussian blue analogs, of which the most likely local structure is Co(OC)(4)(NCFe)(2), co-existed with [Co(H2O)(6)](2+) ions in the DPC bands.

X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) studies, at the Ni and Cr L-2,L-3 edges, reveal the presence of an easy plane of magnetization evidenced by an opening of the magnetic hysteresis loop (coercive field of approximate to 200 Oe) when the magnetic field, B, is at 60 degrees relative to the normal to the substrate. The angular dependence of the X-ray natural linear dichroism (XNLD) reveals both an orientation of the nanocrystals on the substrate and an anisotropy of the electronic cloud of the Ni-II and Cr-III coordination sphere species belonging to the nanocrystals' surface.

With respect to PB cathodes, however, their intrinsic crystal regularity, vacancies, and coordinated water will lead to low specific capacity and poor rate performance, impeding their application. Herein, nanocubic porous NaxFeFe(CN)(6) coated with polydopamine (PDA) as a coupling layer to improve its electrochemical performance is reported, inspired by the excellent adhesive property of PDA. As a cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the NaxFeFe(CN)(6) electrode coupled with PDA delivers a reversible capacity of 93.8 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1), and a discharge capacity of 72.6 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1). The sodium storage mechanism of this NaxFeFe(CN)(6) coupled with PDA is revealed via in situ Raman spectroscopy. The first-principles computational results indicate that Fe-II sites in PB prefer to couple with the robust PDA layer to stabilize the PB structure. Moreover, the sodium-ion migration in the PB structure is enhanced after coating with PDA, thus improving the sodium storage properties. Both experiments and computational simulations present guidelines for the rational design of nanomaterials as electrodes for energy storage devices.

The challenge is in design and controlled syntheses of efficient electrocatalysts with high selectivities, high NH3 yield rates (Y-NH3) and long-term stabilities. Here, a freestanding three-dimensional graphdiyne-hollowed FeCoNi Prussian blue analog electrode (h-FeCoNi PBA@GDY) with highly selective and active interfaces was synthesized by in situ growth of a GDY layer on the surface of h-FeCoNi PBA and used for the ECNtRR in alkaline solution at ambient temperatures and pressures. The experimental results demonstrated that the uniquely incomplete charge transfer between metal atoms and GDY effectively enhanced the intrinsic activity and increased the number of active sites of the electrocatalyst and promoted fast redox switching and high-density charge transport at the interface, which resulted in high selectivity, activity and stability for the ECNtRR. The results indicated that the electrocatalyst showed a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 95.1% with a Y-NH3 of 1015.5 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2) and excellent stability.					liu, huimin/HOC-8602-2023; Xue, Yurui/ACP-4255-2022; LI, Yuliang/AAR-8943-2021; xiaoyu, luan/AGX-9559-2022; Gao, Yaqi/CAI-8034-2022; Xue, Yurui/I-8966-2018	Xue, Yurui/0000-0002-9783-1753													1884-4049	1884-4057				MAR 31	2023	15	1							12	10.1038/s41427-022-00439-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41427-022-00439-8													WOS:000961042000011

Sodium-ion electrochemical tuning of Prussian blue analog as an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst	MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY												Developing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for hydrogen production by water splitting. Besides striving to explore catalysts with new compositions and structures, developing efficient tuning strategy to improve the performance of existing catalysts is of vital importance as well. Here, a sodium-ion electrochemical tuning method is proposed to improve the oxygen evolution catalytic activity of Prussian blue analog (PBA) hexacyanoferrate by tuning the oxidation states and defects in PBA structures. Compared with pristine PBA, the modified catalysts show a significant improvement in OER catalysis, with a decreased Tafel slope from 69 mV/dec to 41 mV/dec and an overpotential drop of 50 mV at 5 mA/mF. This work may promote the application of PBA in OER catalysis and more importantly provide a simple and effective strategy on tuning oxidation state and defects in material microstructures.

Extending Cyanogel and Prussian Blue Analogue Chemistry to Octacyanometallate-Based Coordination Polymers: Reduced Temperature Routes to Materials Based on Molybdenum and Tungsten	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												Cyanide coordination polymers (CCPs) and their products made via thermolysis make up a promising class of materials for a variety of energy and analytical applications. While the chemistry of hexacyanometallate-based CCPs is well developed, that of their octacyanometallate [M(CN)(8)](4-) (M = Mo, W) analogues is underexplored. This work compares the synthesis, morphology, and thermolytic properties of two types of cyanide coordination polymers: the amorphous [PdCl4](2-)-based cyanogel, Pd-Mo/W, and the nanocrystalline CoCl2-based Prussian blue analogue, Co-Mo/W. The general decomposition pathways and products for [M(CN)(8)](4-)-containing polymers are comparable to their hexacyanometallate analogues. All four coordination polymers can be converted to mixed oxide and ternary phosphide systems and generally retain morphology upon heating. Notably, the reduction under inert gas generates alloys in the cyanogel systems and complex reduced mixtures in the Prussian blue analogue (PBA) systems.

Herein, to address the conflict issue between desalination capacity and stability due to mismatched ionic and electronic kinetics for the PBA-based electrodes, a rational design, including Mn substitution and polypyrrole (ppy) connection, has been proposed for the nickel hexacyanoferrate (Mn-NiHCF/ppy), serving as a model case. Particularly, the theoretical calculation manifests the reduced bandgap and energy barrier for ionic diffusion after Mn substitution, combined with the increased electronic conductivity and integrity through ppy connecting, resulting in enhanced redox kinetics and boosted desalination performance. Specifically, the optimized Mn-NiHCF/ppy demonstrates a remarkable desalination capacity of 51.8 mg g-1 at 1.2 V, accompanied by a high charge efficiency of 81%, and excellent cycling stability without obvious degradation up to 50 cycles, outperforming other related materials. Overall, our concept shown herein provides insights into the design of advanced faradaic electrode materials for high-performance CDI. The Mn substitution and structure optimization via ppy connection confer enhanced ion/electron migration to NiHCF. This results in rapid redox kinetics, improves electrode integrity, and ultimately ensures high desalination performance.

The hexagonal bipyramidal microcrystals of Ce-Co PBA can be gradually transformed into dendrites by different proportions of ethanol (EtOH) and water. At the same time, the porous dendrites CeO2/Co@carbon nanotub (CNT) with oxygen-rich vacancies (OVs) can be obtained by annealing Ce-Co PBA at 700 C-degrees. The microstructure study shows that carbon nanotubes will be catalyzed after annealing at high temperature, and the cobalt metal particles encapsulated in carbon nanotubes will be anchored in the matrix, regulating the impedance matching and multi-polarization suppression of the material, and its unique structure, vacancies, and strong interface effect make the material exhibit excellent electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption performance. When the matching thickness is 2.5 mm, the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of the composite is -51.68 dB, and the effective absorption bandwidth (RL < -10 dB) is 7.76 GHz. These results show that the prepared CeO2/Co@CNT composite has excellent EMW absorption properties.

In this work, upon replacing Mn in Co-ion sites, the obtained K alpha Mn x Co(1-x)[Fe(CN)6]beta<middle dot>nH2O Prussian blue analogues displayed an anomalous behavior of photoinduced magnetization changes, which correlates with the content of substituted Mn ions. Especially, for compounds with x >= 0.34, the photoexcitation led to the emergence of a novel demagnetization process characterized by a reduction in magnetic moments, which has not previously been reported. This phenomenon can be explained by the mechanism named spin down of Mn ions driven by metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT) between Fe and Co, wherein the bond elongation induced by MMCT between Fe and Co compresses the bond of the Mn ion, causing the rearrangement of spin in the Mn ion and eventually resulting in demagnetization.

In this work, a Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogue is grown on MOF-Ni by two steps. First, carnation-shaped MOF-Ni is directly grown on the nickel foam. Second, nanocube-like Prussian blue analogue is grown on a MOF-Ni template. After phosphating reaction in a tube furnace, Ni2P/Fe2P (denoted as MNPBA-P) is obtained. MNPBA-P can still maintain the initial structure of nanocubes on a carnation-shaped MOF-Ni, which causes it to have better conductivity and larger electrochemical active surface area. As a bifunctional catalyst, MNPBA-P has a good performance in the catalytic reaction of cathode and anode. It is worth noting that when 0.5 M urea was added to the electrolyte, the high anode overpotential is greatly improved. Compared with overall water-splitting, MNPBA-P assembled into an electrolyzer requires smaller cell voltage in urea electrolysis.

Herein, we report the design and facile synthesis of abundant high-valence cobalt sites by introducing Zn2+ into CoFe Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The modification results in the drastic morphological transformation from a pure phase (CoFe-PBA) to a three-phase composite (CoFeZn-PBA), with a significant increase not only the amount of highly oxidized Co sites but the specific surface area (by up to 4 times). Moreover, the obtained sample also exhibits outstanding electric conductivity. Consequently, an excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 343 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1) was achieved in CoFeZn-PBA, which outperforms the commercial IrO2 catalyst. Further analysis reveals that CoFeZn-PBA becomes (oxyhydr)oxides after the OER.

Out-of-equilibrium dynamics driven by photoinduced charge transfer in CsCoFe Prussian blue analogue nanocrystals	FARADAY DISCUSSIONS												In this paper we study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics associated with photoinduced charge-transfer (CT) in cyanide-bridged Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue nanocrystals. In these coordination networks, the structural trapping of the photoinduced CT polaron involves local electronic and structural reorganizations. Femtosecond X-ray and optical absorption spectroscopies show that the local structural trapping process occurs on similar timescale for particles with 11 nm and 70 nm sizes. The local photoinduced spin transition, elongating the Co-N bonds and driving the (CoFeII)-Fe-III -> (CoFeIII)-Fe-II CT, activates coherent lattice torsion modes. The elastic deformation waves, launched by these bond elongations, drive macroscopic volume expansion and breathing of the particles. The timescale of this macroscopic deformation depends strongly on the size of the particle, which is more evidence of the multiscale nature of photoinduced phenomena in molecular materials.

Herein, we present flexible aqueous batteries that operate in tears and provide a safe power supply to smart contact lenses. Nanocomposite flexible electrodes of carbon nanotubes and Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles for cathode and anode were embedded in UV-polymerized hydrogel as not only a soft contact lens but also an ion-permeable separator. The battery exhibited a discharging capacity of 155 mu Ah in an aqueous electrolyte of 0.15 M Na-ions and 0.02 M K-ions, equivalent to the ionic concentration of tears. The power supply was enough to operate a low-power static random-access memory. In addition, we verified the mechanical stability, biocompatibility and compatibility with a contact lens cleaning solution. It could ultimately enable a safe power supply for smart contact lenses without risk of injury due to the leakage or breakage of the battery.					, 彩天/AAP-8494-2020; Yun, Jeonghun/LKL-5539-2024; Kim, Tony/A-5131-2011; ZHAO, Wenting/AAB-5269-2019; Kim, Minyeong/JHU-5269-2023; Lee, Seok Woo/B-9792-2015; Zhao, Wenting/M-8613-2016; Bae, Tae-Hyun/B-9839-2012	Lee, Seok Woo/0000-0003-2459-7174; Zhao, Wenting/0000-0002-6143-5185; Bae, Tae-Hyun/0000-0003-0033-2526; Kim, Moobum/0000-0002-1084-2338; Yun, Jeonghun/0000-0001-7153-6134													1530-6984	1530-6992				FEB 24	2021	21	4					1659	1665		10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c04362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c04362		FEB 2021						33533624					WOS:000624334100014

Impact of Sodium on the Water Dynamics in Prussian Blue Analogues	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are interesting cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, especially the iron-based, [Fe(CN)6] n- vacancy-free PBA Na2-x Fe[Fe(CN)6]<middle dot>zH2O. However, the presence of water has an opposing role in the application of PBAs as electrode materials: the water provides structural stability ensuring minimum volume changes during sodium extraction and insertion, however, water can react with the electrolyte leading to unwanted side reactions. Therefore, water must be replaced with another compatible small molecule to ensure optimal performance. To achieve this, insights into the dynamics of water are crucial. Two samples with compositions of Na1.90(9)Fe0.90(7) 2+Fe0.10(3) 3+[Fe2+(CN)6]<middle dot>2.12(2)H2O and Na0.34(5)Fe3+[Fe2.66(5)+(CN)6]<middle dot>0.360(4)H2O were investigated using quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). The results show that the water dynamics strongly depend on the sodium content. The water was found to diffuse within a spherical cavity in the porous framework with a radius of 2.6 & Aring; for the high sodium-containing sample and 1.8 & Aring; for the low sodium-containing sample consistent with the pore sizes in the crystal structures. In addition to the water diffusing within the pores, it was found that a small fraction of the water exhibits a rattling or rotational motion suggesting that this water strongly interacts and binds to the sodium ions. For the high sodium-containing sample, this rattling or rotational motion transforms into quantum rotational tunneling of the water below 75 K. These results give new fundamental insight into the role of water in PBAs, laying the groundwork for substituting water with another small molecule compatible with nonaqueous battery systems while also ensuring structural stability.

J	Wang, ML; Ling, R; Yang, C; Qi, WT				Wang, Menglei; Ling, Rui; Yang, Chao; Qi, Wentao			Structural regulation of Mn-based Prussian blue induced by zinc-substitution for enhanced sodium storage performance	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												Mn-based Prussian blue (NMF) is a prospective choice for sodium-ion battery cathode materials because of its high theoretical specific capacity, high charge/discharge voltage plateau, cheap raw materials and eco-friendly. However, it undergoes serious capacity fading during cycling owing to the unstable Jahn-Teller distortion caused by the oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+. In this work, the structural regulation of NMF is achieved through zinc substitution, and the effect of structural adjustment caused by zinc substitution on the sodium storage properties of NMF is studied in detail. The experimental results verify that NZMF still maintain cubic structure with high content of sodium, less [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and low level of crystal water. Moreover, the four coordination of ZnN is lower than six coordination of Mn-N, confining the nucleus growth, thereby reducing the powders size of NZMF. The smaller powder size of NZMF with higher surface area results in shortened sodium ion diffusion path and accelerated the charge transfer. In addition, the electrochemically inactive zinc plays a pillar role in maintaining its structural stability. Consequently, NZMF reveals better rate capacity and cycling stability than original NMF. In particular, its capacity can be maintained at 68.6 mAh g  1 under a high current density of 1600 mA/g, and the capacity retention is 76.5% at 800 mA/g after 1000 cycles. This work provides a new insight to improve the structural stability of Prussian blue.																			0013-4686	1873-3859				SEP 10	2023	462								142711	10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142711	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142711		JUN 2023											WOS:001032446700001

Results indicate that the dramatic enhancement of BPA degradation could be partly attributed to the induced homogeneous Fenton reaction by the enhanced dissolution of Fe-III-Co PBA. Meanwhile, the Hz coordinated iron site (H2NH2N-Fe), which is evolved from the original water coordinated iron site (H2O-Fe), was identified as the main active site. A possible reaction pathway involving the proposed active iron species was proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ion insertion/release was accomplished by adopting an electrochemically-driven process. A reversible intercalation was observed while considering both heavy and ligth rare earth elements. The amount of REEs inserted/released over the process and its kinetic evolution during the process were also studied by a chemometric approach. For CuHCF, it was seen that the intercalation of heavy rare earth elements occurs easily respect to the light ones, suggesting a possible selectivity among these ions.					; Giorgetti, Marco/X-3754-2019	Berrettoni, Mario/0000-0002-2273-035X; Conti, Paolo/0000-0002-5469-5173; Giorgetti, Marco/0000-0001-7967-8364													1572-6657	1873-2569				OCT 15	2023	947								117791	10.1016/j.jelechem.2023.117791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2023.117791		SEP 2023											WOS:001080326000001

The structural stability of PB materials is directly associated with the presence of crystal water within the open 3D framework. However, there remains a lack of consensus regarding whether all forms of crystal water have detrimental effects on the structural stability of the PB materials. Currently, it is widely accepted that interstitial water is the stability troublemaker, whereas the role of coordination water remains elusive. In this work, the dynamic evolution of PB structures is investigated during the crystal water (in all forms) removal process through a variety of online monitoring techniques. It can be inferred that the PB-130 degrees C retains trace coordination water (1.3%) and original structural integrity, whereas PB-180 degrees C eliminates almost all of crystal water (similar to 12.1%, including both interstitial and coordinated water), but inevitably suffers from structural collapse. This is mainly because the coordinated water within the PB material plays a crucial role in maintaining structural stability via forming the -N equivalent to C-Fe-LS-C equivalent to N- conjugate bridge. Consequently, PB-130 degrees C with trace coordination water delivers superior reversible capacity (113.6 mAh g(-1)), high rate capability (charge to >80% capacity in 3 min), and long cycling stability (only 0.012% fading per cycle), demonstrating its promising prospect in practical applications.
