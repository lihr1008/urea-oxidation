Evidence of nitrogen inputs affecting soil nitrogen purification by mediating root exudates of salt marsh plants	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Salt marsh has an important 'purification' role in coastal ecosystems by removing excess nitrogen that could otherwise harm aquatic life and reduce water quality. Recent studies suggest that salt marsh root exudates might be the 'control centre' for nitrogen transformation, but empirical evidence is lacking. Here we sought to estimate the direction and magnitude of nitrogen purification by salt marsh root exudates and gain a mechanistic understanding of the biogeochemical transformation pathway(s). To achieve this, we used a laboratory incubation to quantify both the root exudates and soil nitrogen purification rates, in addition to the enzyme activities and functional genes under Phragmites australis populations with different nitrogen forms addition (NO3-, NH4+ and urea). We found that NO3- and urea addition significantly stimulate P. australis root exudation of total acids, amino acids, total sugars and total organic carbon, while NH4+ addition only significantly increased total acids, amino acids and total phenol exudation. High total sugars, amino acids and total organic carbon concentrations enlarged nitrogen purification potential by stimulating the nitrogen purifying bacterial activities (including enzyme activities and related genes expression). Potential denitrification rates were not significantly elevated under NH4+ addition in comparison to NO3- and urea addition, which should be ascribed to total phenol self-toxicity and selective inhibition. Further, urea addition stimulated urease and protease activities with providing more NH4+ and NO2- substrates for elevated anaerobic ammonium oxidation rates among the nitrogen addition treatments. Overall, this study revealed that exogenous nitrogen could increase the nitrogen purification-associated bacterial activity through accelerating the root exudate release, which could stimulate the activity of nitrogen transformation, and then improve the nitrogen removal capacity in salt marsh.

It is believed that the efficient hydrogen generation of water cracking is restricted from the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Consequently, it is highly recommended to find alternative anodizing to produce hydrogen to reduce electricity consumption. Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an alternative to the traditional anodic OER. In this paper, an electrocatalyst FeP4/CoP@NF-7.5 supported on nickel foam (NF) was designed by using a template-directed growth and low-temperature phosphating method. The FeP4/CoP@NF-7.5 with a rich interface gives it more active sites and enhances mass transfer and conductivity, possessing excellent catalytic performance against hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), OER and UOR in alkaline electrolyte. Thanks to the abundant interface and bimetallic synergy, the designed catalyst exhibits the overpotentials of 45 mV and 259 mV for HER and OER to transfer 10 mA cm -2. In addition, FeP4/CoP@NF-7.5 also possesses significant catalytic activity against UOR of 136 mV (j10) in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, which provides another alternative to the low efficiency of OER through the reduction of hydrogen production costs. Finally, the overall water splitting test was undertaken in 1 M KOH containing/free of 0.33 M urea. Remarkably, only 1.43 V is required to drive on urea electrolyzer (j10 = 10 mA cm -2), while 1.52 V are gained on water electrolyzer. This paper lays the foundation for the developing of high -active transition bimetallic phosphide electrocatalysts for energy-saving hydrogen production.

The effects of the component ratios of starch, urea, sodium bicarbonate, iron and manganese salts and pyrolysis temperatures on the removal performance of bisphenol A (BPA) were discussed. FeMn@CN-800, which pyrolyzed at 800 C with a mass ratio of starch:urea:Fe:Mn = 100:100:0.34:0.66 showed 95.4% BPA removal and 73.5% mineralization within 60 min. Large specific surface (663 m(2) g(-1)), rich hierarchical pore structures and N-doping facilitated the adsorption of BPA and peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Fe and Mn are located in the carbon layer in the form of iron carbide and manganese oxide, and act as electron donors to activate the PMS. Chemical quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) confirmed that hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-), superoxide anion radical (O-2(center dot-)), and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) are the ROS in this system. Electrochemical tests showed the formation of catalyst-PMS complexes and catalyst facilitated the direct electron transfer from BPA to PMS. The effect of reaction parameters, cyclic experiments, possible BPA degradation pathways were investigated. This work provides the first systematic evaluation of starch-derived materials as high-performance catalysts for PMS-based advanced oxidation processes.

The resulting Au/ZnO catalysts showed excellent photocatalytic performance (around 40 %) for the degradation of 400 ppb nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at a laboratory reactor scale under UV-A irradiation as low as 0.1 W/m2 at 50 % relative humidity. The high activity was attributed to the Au-ZnO heterojunction formation, which significantly promoted the transfer of photogenerated holes from ZnO to Au and the water oxidation process on Au nanoparticles, improving the NO2 photocatalytic oxidation reaction due to a higher generation of OH center dot radical. The NO2 degradation was also investigated under realistic indoor visible light irradiation with NO2 concentrations found indoors (40 and 100 ppb). This work showed the prospects of applications of Au/ZnO materials in the field of indoor photocatalytic purification and gave a new insight into the study of ZnO-based composites for the photocatalytic degradation of NOx.

However, the response of N2O emission to NBPT amendment is inconsistent across soils and associated microbial mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we performed a meta-analysis of the effects of NBPT on N2O emissions and found NBPT significantly reduced N2O emissions in alkaline soils whereas no obvious effects exhibited in add soils. Based on the finding of meta-analysis that pH was a key modifier in regulating the effect of NBPT on N2O emissions, we selected two arable soils differing in pH and conducted a microcosm study. In conjunction with measurement of N2O emission, community structure and abundance of functional guilds were assessed using T-RFLP and qPCR. Our results showed NBPT retarded urea hydrolysis and inhibited nitrification. but stimulated N2O emission in alkaline soil, whereas it exhibited no remarkable effects in acid soil, thereby only partly confirming the results of meta-analysis. Abundances of AOB and ureC-containing bacteria decreased, while abundance of AOA increased in both soils with NBPT addition. For acid soil, N2O emissions were significantly correlated with both abundances and community structures of AOA and ureC-containing bacteria, as well as abundance of AOB; for alkaline soil, abundances and community structures of AOB were correlated with N2O emission, as well as community structures of ureC-containing bacteria and archaea, indicating an inconsistent response pattern of community traits of N2O emissions-related functional guilds to NBPT between alkaline soil and acid soil. Our findings suggest that (i) efficacy of NBPT in N2O emission was mainly influenced by soil pH and (ii) variable effects of NBPT on N2O emission might originate not only from the direct effect of NBPT on community traits of urease-positive microbes, but from the indirect effect on ammonia oxidizers.

Satheesh			Zirconium copper oxide microflowers based non-enzymatic screen-printed electrochemical sensor for the detection of glucose in saliva, urine, and blood serum	MICROCHIMICA ACTA												Zirconium copper oxide microflowers (Zr/CuO MF) based non-enzymatic sensor was developed for glucose detection in saliva, urine, and blood. An easy urea hydrolysis method was employed for the synthesis of the metal oxide and further calcined to improve the catalytic property. The flower-like morphology of the Zr/CuO was confirmed by SEM analysis and the presence of copper and zirconium was examined using energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The Zr/CuO MF modified screen-printed electrodes exhibited excellent glucose sensing performance in 0.15 M NaOH medium and could quantify glucose in the range from 10 & mu;M to 27 mM. A high sensitivity of 1.815 & PLUSMN; 0.003 mA mM-1 cm-2 was obtained for lower glucose concentration from 15 & mu;M to 3 mM and 1.250 & PLUSMN; 0.006 mA mM-1 cm-2 for higher concentration glucose from 3 to 27 mM. The limit of detection of the fabricated sensor was found to be 0.8 & mu;M. The sensor displayed high selectivity and stability towards glucose in different body fluids like saliva, urine, and blood serum at a working potential of 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). In saliva, urine, and serum samples, the sensor exhibited excellent recovery of 95-108, 92-108, and 93-101% in saliva, urine, and serum, respectively, with a relative standard deviation of less than 10%, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability of the sensor. The developed sensor is promising for developing an invasive and non-invasive point-of-care testing device for glucose detection.

Experimental and theoretical results revealed that oxygen doping preferentially occurred on the two-coordinated nitrogen positions, which create the formation of low and high electron density areas resulting in the electronic structure modulation of O-CN. As a result, the resultant O-CN exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and excellent long-term stability for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation toward the degradation of organic pollutants. The O-CN with modulated electronic structure enables PMS oxidation over the electron-deficient C atoms for the generation of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and PMS reduction around the electron-rich O dopants for the formation of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-), in which O-1(2) is the major reactive oxygen species, contributing to the selective reactivity of the O-CN/PMS system. Our findings not only propose a novel PMS activation mechanism in terms of simultaneous PMS oxidation and reduction for the production of nonradical and radical species but also provide a valuable insight for the development of efficient metal-free catalysts through nonmetal doping toward the persulfate-based environmental cleanup.

The desalination of brackish water in the desalination cell is initiated via photoinduced charge generation with a thermochemically reduced TiO2 nanorod array photoanode. The chlorides transferred to the neighboring anolyte at ion-transport efficiency of similar to 100% are photoelectrochemically transformed into reactive chlorine species responsible for the decomposition of urea into nitrate in the anolyte. Simultaneously, the H-2 production with a Ni-Mo-S (Ni2S3/MoS2) composite catalyst grown onto porous Ni substrate is achieved at Faradaic efficiency of similar to 90% in the catholyte concentrated with desalted Na+. Regardless of the operation condition, the H-2 energy contributes to the reduction in the energy consumption for desalination by 25%-30%. The overall ternary hybrid process is understood systematically, and the physiochemical properties and electrochemical behavior of the Ni-Mo-S catalysts are examined.

Herein, Fe and N co-doped graphene (FeNGO) was synthesized from graphene oxide (GO), urea, and iron salt via simple impregnation pyrolysis, and applied for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade NFX. FeNGO possessed a two-dimensional porous sheet structure and was rich in defects, nitrogen species, and active sites. Compared with the control catalyst doped with N or Fe alone, FeNGO/PMS system showed the best degradation performance with 97.7% removal of NFX after 30 min, the rate constant was 7.1 and 1.7 times than that for NGO and FeGO, respectively. Fe3N was the main active site of FeNGO, and it is confirmed that singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2 center dot-) were the primary oxidation active species (ROS) during NFX degradation. The formation of 1O2 came from the transformation of O2 center dot- and PMS decomposition. FeNGO showed strong pH adaptability, and also exhibited stale degradation performance in saliferous water matrices. It is believed that this work will offer theoretical and practical guidance for PMS activation by non-radical pathways.

Gas-phase photocatalytic degradation of ethylbenzene, an aromatic VOC emitted from various sources, has been investigated in this study using TiO2 nanoparticle-coated glass beads in an annular photoreactor. To use visible light irradiation, TiO2 nanoparticles were doped by nitrogen using urea. The results showed that nitrogen doping significantly increased the removal efficiency of ethylbenzene under visible light irradiation compared with the pure TiO2, so that the removal efficiencies between 75-100% could be yielded for the initial ethylbenzene concentrations up to 0.13 g/m(3) under visible light which could be useful for improving indoor air quality. The UV irradiated reactor needed less residence time and much higher removal efficiencies could be yielded at high initial concentrations. When the residence time under UV irradiation was one third of the same under visible light, the removal efficiency was more than 80% for the inlet concentrations up to 0.6 g/m(3), whereas the removal efficiency under visible light was about 25% at this inlet concentration. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model could be well fitted to the photocatalytic reaction in both irradiation systems.

Although an important role of the liver in ammonia metabolism is widely accepted, the role of ammonia metabolizing pathways in the liver for maintenance of whole-body ammonia homeostasis in vivo remains ill-defined. Here, we show by generation of liver-specific Gln synthetase (GS)-deficient mice that GS in the liver is critically involved in systemic ammonia homeostasis in vivo. Hepatic deletion of GS triggered systemic hyperammonemia, which was associated with cerebral oxidative stress as indicated by increased levels of oxidized RNA and enhanced protein Tyr nitration. Liver-specific GS-deficient mice showed increased locomotion, impaired fear memory, and a slightly reduced life span. In conclusion, the present observations highlight the importance of hepatic GS for maintenance of ammonia homeostasis and establish the liver-specific GS KO mouse as a model with which to study effects of chronic hyperammonemia.

This electrode shows excellent UOR activity. In 1 M KOH containing 0.4 M urea, it only needs 1.42 and 1.43 V voltage to achieve 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) current. On the contrary, to reach 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), OER require 1.68 and 1.75 V. Besides promising UOR activity, the HER property of this electrode is also attractive. In urea containing electrolyte, its eta(10) and eta(100) are only 128 and 283 mV. More importantly, it shows excellent stability in both UOR and HER. In electrolytic cell, with this electrode as cathode and anode simultaneously, only 1.42 and 1.49 V voltage is needed to obtain 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) current in urea containing electrolyte.

The nitrification inhibitor, 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), acts by slowing nitrification and is used to improve fertilizer use efficiency and reduce N losses from agricultural systems; however, its effects on nitrifier and denitrifier activities in intensive vegetable cultivation soils are unknown.Materials and methodsIn this study, we measured the impacts of DMPP on N2O emissions, ammonia oxidizers, and denitrifying microbes in two intensive vegetable cultivation soils: one that had been cultivated for a short term (1year) and one that had been cultivated over a longer term (29years). The quantitative PCR technique was used in this study. Three treatments, including control (no fertilizer), urea alone, and urea with DMPP, were included for each soil. The application rates of urea and DMPP were 1800kgha(-1) and 0.5% of the urea-N application rate.Results and discussionThe application of N significantly increased N2O emissions in both soils. The abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) increased significantly with high rate of N fertilizer application in both soils. Conversely, there was no change in the growth rate of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in response to the applied urea despite the presence of larger numbers of AOA in these soils. This suggests AOB may play a greater role than AOA in the nitrification process, and N2O emission in intensive vegetable cultivation soils. The application of DMPP significantly reduced soil NO3--N content and N2O emission, and delayed ammonia oxidation. It greatly reduced AOB abundance, but not AOA abundance. Moreover, the presence of DMPP was correlated with a significant decrease in the abundance of nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) genes.ConclusionsLong-term intensive vegetable cultivation with heavy N fertilization altered AOB and nirS abundance. In vegetable cultivation soils with high N levels, DMPP can be effective in mitigating N2O emissions by directly inhibiting both ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying microbes.

Here a Sr-induced phase transformed beta-FeOOH/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst anchored on Ni-foam (designated as pt-NFS) is introduced, where Sr produces plenteous Fe4+ (Fe3+ -> Fe4+) to modulate Fermi level and e(-)-transfer from e(-)-rich Ni3+(t(2g))-orbitals to e(-)-deficient Fe4+(t(2g))-orbitals, via strong pi-donation from the pi-symmetry lone-pair of O bridge. pt-NFS utilizes Fe-sites near the Sr-atom to break the H & horbar;O & horbar;H bonds and weakens the adsorption of *O while strengthening that of *OOH, toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Invaluably, Fe-sites of pt-NFS activate H-2-production from urea oxidation reaction (UOR) through a one-stage pathway which, unlike conventional two-stage pathways with two NH3-molecules, involves only one NH3-molecule. Owing to more suitable kinetic energetics, pt-NFS requires 133 mV (negative potential shift), 193 mV, approximate to 1.352 V, and approximate to 1.375 V versus RHE for HER, OER, UOR, and human urine oxidation, respectively, to reach the benchmark 10 mA cm(-2) and also demonstrates remarkable durability of over 25 h. This work opens a new corridor to design multifunctional electrocatalysts with precise Fermi engineering through d-band modulation.

Distinct maternal glucose trajectories were identified using a latent class model based on blood glucose levels across the three trimesters, and their association with neonatal circulating metabolites, including 11 amino acids and 33 acylcarnitines, was examined, adjusting for potential confounding factors.RESULTS Three distinct groups of maternal glucose trajectories were identified: consistent normoglycemia (n = 8,648), mid-to-late gestational hyperglycemia (n = 2,540), and early-onset hyperglycemia (n = 269). Mid-to-late gestational hyperglycemia was associated with decreased levels of amino acids (alanine, arginine, ornithine, and proline) involved in the arginine and proline metabolism and urea cycle pathway, as well as increased levels of C4DC+C5-OH and decreased level of C6DC and C10:1. Early-onset hyperglycemia was associated with elevated levels of free acylcarnitine and C4DC+C5-OH and a decreased level of C10:1, involved in the fatty acid oxidation pathway. However, these associations were primarily observed in male neonates rather than in female neonates.CONCLUSIONS Our findings revealed a significant link between maternal glucose trajectories throughout pregnancy and neonatal arginine and proline metabolism, urea cycle pathway, and fatty acid oxidation pathway. These results highlight the importance of maintaining optimal blood glucose levels throughout pregnancy to promote healthy neonatal metabolic outcomes.

The nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6- (tricholoromethyl)-pyridine, CP) has been applied to improve NUE and reduce environmental pollution in paddy soil. However, the effects of nitrapyrin combined with nitrogen fertilizers on ammonia oxidizers in yellow clay paddy soil have not been examined.Materials and methodsA randomized complete block design was set with three treatments: (1) without nitrogen fertilizer (CK), (2) common prilled urea (PU), and (3) prilled urea with nitrapyrin (NPU). Soil samples were collected from three treatments where CK, PU, and NPU had been repeatedly applied over 5years. Soil samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR and 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing of the amoA gene to investigate the influence of nitrapyrin combined with nitrogen on the abundance and community structure of ammonia oxidizers in yellow clay paddy soil.Results and discussionThe potential nitrification rate (PNR) of the soil was significantly correlated with the abundances of both ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Application of urea significantly stimulated AOA and AOB growth, whereas nitrapyrin exhibited inhibitory effects on AOA. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the most dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of AOA and AOB were affiliated with the Nitrosotalea cluster and Nitrosospira cluster 12, respectively. AOA and AOB community structures were not altered by urea and nitrapyrin application.ConclusionsNitrogen fertilization stimulated nitrification and increased the population sizes of AOA and AOB. Nitrapyrin affected the abundance, but not community structure of ammonia oxidizers in yellow clay soil. Our results suggested that nitrapyrin improving NUE and inhibiting PNR was attributable to the inhibition of AOA growth.

A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with silver nanoparticles and functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes was used as working sensor. The modified GCE displays substantial analytical improvements including an amplified signal, fast electron transfer kinetics, and resistance to fouling. The irreversible oxidation signal of DNL is pH-dependent. Best reactivity is found at pH3.0, where a typical anodic peak is recorded at 0.8V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Square-wave voltammetry revealed a 8.4nM detection limit (1.9 mu gL(-1)), good repeatability and reproducibility (RSDs <5.0%), and good accuracy (93.2-99.4% recovery from spiked samples). The modified electrode is highly stable even in the presence of ions (Na+ and K+), urea and uric acid. The electrochemical sensor fulfills all requisites to be used as forensic device in surveillance of illegal livestock practices.

We examined protective effects of PGG on IRI-induced acute AKI. Clamping both renal arteries for 45 min induced isechemia and then reperfusion. Treatment with PGG (10 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day for four days) significantly ameliorated urine volume, urine osmolality, creatinine clearance (Ccr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In addition, PGG increased aquaporine 1/2/3, Na+-K+-ATPase and urea transporter (UT-B) and decreased ICAM-1, MCP-1, and HMGB-1 expression. In this histopathologic study, PGG improved glomerular and tubular damage. Immunohistochemistry results showed that PGG increased aquaporine 1/2, and Na+-K+ ATPase and decreased ICAM-1 expression. These findings suggest that PGG ameliorates tubular injury including tubular dysfunction and microvascular inflammation in IRI-induced AKI rats.

We demonstrated sub-2-nm, ligand-free UNMNs grown in situ on seven different types of nitrided carbons with no organic ligands via chemical reduction or thermolysis. Ligand-free UNMNs supported on carbon showed superior electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation compared to counterparts with surface capping agents or larger nanocrystals on the same carbon supports.

J	Yair, R; Allen, MS				Yair, Roni; Allen, Michael S.			Short communication: Short-term intravenous amino acid infusions as a method to detect limiting amino acids in dairy cattle diets	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												We hypothesized that the addition of limiting AA increases dry matter intake (DMI) by reducing anaplerosis and hepatic oxidation. Accordingly, the objective of this work was to examine the effects of short-term intravenous infusions of Met, Lys, and His (which are considered the most limiting AA) on DMI as a method to detect whether specific AA are limiting in dairy cow diets. We conducted 4 experiments using Holstein cows in the immediate postpartum period to address this objective. The first experiment used 4 cows 6 to 10 d postpartum (PP) in a 4 x 4 Latin square design with 1-d periods including 12 h for infusions and 12 h for recovery. Treatments were continuous infusions of 5 (low), 10 (medium), or 15% (high) of the calculated requirement of metabolizable Met, Lys, and His or 0.9% saline (control, CONT). In the second and third experiments, 8 cows (4-12 d PP) were divided into 2 groups of 4 cows, and each group received a different diet formulated to either be low in Lys (experiment 2) or Met (experiment 3). Each experiment was a crossover design with two 1-d periods with 12-h infusions (continuous) and 12 h for recovery. Treatments were 15% of the calculated requirement of metabolizable Met, Lys, and His (high), or 0.9% saline (CONT). In the fourth experiment, 5 cows (4-14 d PP) were used in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. Periods were 2 d in which treatments were continuously infused for the first 46 h. Treatments were 0.9% saline (CONT), all (Lys, Met, and His), LM (Lys and Met), LH (Lys and His), and MH (Met and His); dosages were equal to the estimated shortage in each specific AA. In each experiment, feed intake was recorded by a computerized data acquisition system, milk yield was recorded, and milk composition was analyzed for fat, protein, lactose, and milk urea nitrogen (MUN) concentrations. Treatments did not affect DMI or yield of milk or milk components in the first experiment. In the second experiment, AA treatment increased protein percentage and reduced lactose percentage but had no effect on protein and lactose yields or DMI. In the third experiment, the AA treatment tended to increase yields of milk, lactose, and protein as well as MUN concentration but did not affect DMI. In the fourth experiment, no effects were detected for DMI and milk yield, whereas the all, LH, and LM treatments reduced milk lactose concentration compared with CONT, and MH increased MUN concentration compared with CONT and other treatments. These results failed to provide support for our hypothesis that short-term addition of these potentially limiting AA will increase DMI. This may be due to our hypothesis being inaccurate or to other factors; other limiting AA could have prevented the effects of Lys, Met, and His infusions or the infusion periods could have been too short to induce a response in DMI. Accordingly, short-term infusion of AA is probably not a sensitive method to detect limiting AA in dairy cow diets.																			0022-0302	1525-3198				NOV	2017	100	11					9036	9041		10.3168/jds.2017-12844	http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-12844								28918133					WOS:000413606600035

A biocatalytic off/on switch	ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS												Coupling of redox-silent biocatalytic processes for analyte detection with enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions for signal generation is proposed by the modulation of electrostatic interactions between a pH-responsive polymer and a redox enzyme to control the off-on transition for electrochemical signal generation. Glassy carbon electrodes are modified with a poly(vinyl)imidazole Os(bipyridine)(2)Cl redox hydrogel film entrapping urease and PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase, while glucose is present in the solution. The off-on transition is based on the detection of urea as model analyte which is hydrolyzed to ammonia by urease within the hydrogel film concomitantly increasing the local pH value thus invoking deprotonation of the imidazole groups at the polymer backbone. The decrease of positive charges at the polymer decreases electrostatic repulsion between the polymer and the positively charged PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase. Hence, electron transfer rates between polymer-bound Os complexes and PQQ inside the enzyme are enhanced activating electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. This process generates the electrochemical signal for urea detection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Panda, C; Sarkar, A; Sen Gupta, S				Panda, Chakadola; Sarkar, Aniruddha; Sen Gupta, Sayam			Coordination chemistry of carboxamide 'Nx' ligands to metal ions for bio-inspired catalysis	COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS												Deprotonated carboxamidate 'N' donors have been extensively explored as ligands to support metal ions with unusual higher oxidation states. Their ability to serve as both sigma and pi-electron donor, being resistant to oxidation and provide exceptional hydrolytic stability to a coordinated metal ion has altogether enhanced the broad applicability of carboxamidate ligands in bio-mimetic catalysis. Although the biological precedents with such class of ligands are very less (Nitrile hydratases, Bleomycin, nickel superoxide dismutases, etc.), the synthetic modelling of various metalloenzymes employing carboxamidate ligands have emerged rapidly in the past few decades. The present review accounts for the brief discussion on the unique electronic structure and coordination chemistry these ligands exhibit and exclusively outlines the significant developments in bio-mimetic oxidation chemistry with special reference to high valent metal oxidants and their reactivity towards organic substrates. The notable achievements obtained by using these classes of ligands stretches back to 1848 for the development of the popular biuret reaction followed by the exploration of bio-mimetic metal-peptide complexes, pyridylcarboxamides for stabilization high valent metal-oxo species of late first row transition metal ions. The design of urea based tripodalcarboxamide ligands by Borovik et al. to install hydrogen bonding interactions to stabilize oxo/ hydroxo-metal complexes also renders significant development in the bio-inspired catalysis. To the best of our knowledge, the most important outcome of research employing carboxamide ligands has been the discovery of tetraamido macrocyclic ligands (TAMLs) by Collins and co-workers who managed to make seven generations of the Fe-TAML catalyst that find interesting applications.

In this work, the formation of iron oxides and oxyhydroxide anisotropic nanoparticles (ANPs) obtained by the co-precipitation method in the presence of urea was studied. Reaction pathways of iron oxide and oxyhydroxide ANPs formation are described based on of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and pulse magnetometry studies. It is shown that a nonmonotonic change in the Fe3O4 content occurs during synthesis. The maximum content of the Fe3O4 phase of 47.4% was obtained at 12 h of the synthesis. At the same time, the reaction products contain ANPs of alpha-FeOOH and submicron isotropic particles of Fe3O4, the latter formation can occur due to the oxidation of Fe2+ ions by air-oxygen and Ostwald ripening processes. A subsequent increase in the synthesis time leads to the predominant formation of an alpha-FeOOH phase due to the oxidation of Fe3O4. As a result of the work, a methodological scheme for the analysis of iron oxide and oxyhydroxide ANPs was developed.

However, the high Pt loading in the anode substantially hampers the practical implementation of AEM-DAFCs. Herein, the Ni4Cu1Cox (x = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0)-BP catalysts were prepared for the first time, achieving the best ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) performance at x = 1.5. Density func-tional theory calculations reveal that such improvement is ascribed to the lowered adsorption energy and the Gibbs free energy of AOR intermediates as Co doping introduces electron aggregation around O atoms. The AEM-DAFC based on Ni4Cu1Co1.5-BP anode can deliver a peak power density (PPD) of 115.7 mW cm-2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.75 V at 80 degrees C. According to our knowledge, such PPD is the highest among precious metal -free electrodes-based AEM-DAFCs, showing that the Ni4Cu1Co1.5-BP is a promising candidate for anode catalyst in AEM-DAFCs.

Binary reduced graphene oxide and graphitic carbon nitride (RGO/g-C3N4) visible-light photocatalyst was successfully fabricated by the freeze drying assisted thermal polymerization method with urea and dicyandiamide as raw materials, respectively. The morphologies, structures and optical properties were characterized by various techniques. It was found that g-C3N4 and RGO nanostructures formed an intimate contact across the heterojunction interface. The photodegradation performances of catalysts were evaluated by removing bisphenol A (BPA) with the activation of persulfate (PS). The results indicated that the photocatalytic activities of photocatalysts were enhanced with the addition of PS as an oxidant and electron acceptor under visible light irradiation (lambda>420 nm). Moreover, BPA was almost completely removed by RGO/g-C3N4 prepared with urea as raw material in 40 min. After five recovery tests, the removal efficiency of BPA for the catalyst was up to 80% within 40 min under visible light irradiation, which exhibited superior stability.

Protective effects of spirulina against hemato-biochemical alterations, nephrotoxicity, and DNA damage upon lead exposition	HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												The current study was aimed at exploring the protective efficacy of spirulina against the hemato-biochemical alterations and nephrotoxicity induced by lead (Pb). Female rats aged 12 weeks were treated for 4 weeks with Pb (0.344 g kg(-1) bw) associated or not with spirulina (5.3 g kg(-1) bw). Renal damage induced by Pb was related to a severe anemia, increases of oxidative stress-related parameters (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (+29%), protein carbonyl (PCO) (+66.3%), and advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) (+110%)), plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (+80%), creatinine and urea levels in plasma, and uric acid concentration in urine, as well as genotoxic changes (+89.3% and +60% for DNA and mRNA levels, respectively). Conversely, LDH and antioxidant enzyme activities in kidney were decreased, as well as the levels of plasma uric acid, and urinary creatinine and urea levels. Spirulina-supplemented rats exhibited normal peripheral blood and renal parameters and renal histology. It can be suggested that Arthrospira platensis alleviates damages induced by Pb, thanks to its high phenolic content and antioxidant capacity.					elfeki, abdelfattah/LKL-6561-2024; magne, christian/AAD-6357-2021	GARGOURI, Manel/0000-0002-1803-3308; elfeki, abdelfattah/0009-0009-9949-1367													0960-3271	1477-0903				JUN	2020	39	6					855	869	0960327120903490	10.1177/0960327120903490	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0960327120903490		JAN 2020						32003233					WOS:000510634600001

Changes in Saliva Analytes in Dairy Cows during Peripartum: A Pilot Study	ANIMALS												Simple Summary The use of saliva as a biological fluid to assess welfare and health status is gaining interest nowadays since it can be collected by non-invasive methods without specialized staff. The possibility of measuring analytes in saliva by techniques adapted to automated analyzers is cost-effective, reliable, and replicable. These analytes can provide information useful for the evaluation of welfare and health in dairy cows. In this pilot study, a total of 26 salivary analytes were measured in healthy dairy cows along their peripartum period to assess possible changes and associations with their inflammatory, energy, and milk yield status. Salivary analytes related to stress (cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase, butyrylcholinesterase, and total esterase), immunity (adenosine deaminase), oxidative status (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity and the advanced oxidation protein products), and general metabolism (creatine kinase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, urea, triglycerides, glucose, and lactate) had significant changes throughout this period. This study indicated that the saliva of dairy cows shows changes in its composition during the transition period and potentially can be a source of biomarkers for monitoring health and welfare. This pilot study aimed to study the possible changes in a profile of 26 salivary analytes in thirteen healthy dairy cows along their peripartum period. Analytes associated with the stress (salivary cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase, butyrylcholinesterase, and total esterase), inflammation (adenosine deaminase), oxidative status (total antioxidant capacity and the advanced oxidation protein products), and general metabolism (creatine kinase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, urea, triglycerides, glucose, and lactate) varied along the sampling times. A positive correlation between the white blood cells counts, and the lipase, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, advanced oxidation protein products, and lactate levels in saliva were observed at the delivery. A linear association between selected salivary analytes at different sampling times and the milk yield after calving was observed. In conclusion, in our experimental conditions, it was observed that the peripartum period in dairy cows can induce changes in salivary analytes. Some of them were associated with inflammatory status and the capacity of milk production after calving.

We highlight in biochemical terms and mechanisms how fasting impacts four metabolic pathways-glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, amino acid oxidation, and fatty acid beta-oxidation-that are actively engaged in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Fasting results in reduced insulin secretion and increased glucagon and epinephrine release to prevent or stimulate metabolic reaction(s). Fasting stimulates glycogenolysis, amino acid and glucose oxidation, aminotransferase reactions in skeletal muscle, and promotes gluconeogenesis and urea production in the liver. In addition, fasting promotes gene expression of lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle, the synthesis of ketone bodies in the liver, and intracellular hormone-sensitive lipase activity in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the impact of fasting on reducing cellular damage by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species is discussed. Lastly, we briefly describe the impact of fasting on the four steps of pharmacokinetics-the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a few select drugs-with an emphasis on the elimination of drugs related to the cytochrome-P450 family of enzymes.

However, their presence on the early Earth is strongly debated because the low availability of phosphate, which is generally assumed to have been sequestered in insoluble calcium and iron minerals, is widely viewed as a major barrier to organophosphate generation. Herein, we demonstrate that cyanide (an essential prebiotic precursor) and urea-based solvents could promote nucleoside phosphorylation by transforming insoluble phosphate minerals in a "warm little pond" scenario into more soluble and reactive species. Our results suggest that cyanide and its derivatives (metal cyanide complexes, urea, ammonium formate, and formamide) were key reagents for the participation of phosphorus in chemical evolution. These results allow us to propose a holistic scenario in which an evaporitic environment could concentrate abiotically formed organics and transform the underlying minerals, allowing significant organic phosphorylation under plausible prebiotic conditions.

This substrate-dependent chemoselective strategy enables N-(2-mercaptophenyl)-N'-substituted ureas through the N-S bond coupling/oxidation cascade to selectively produce benzothiadiazin-3-one 1-oxides; however, the transformation of 2-mercaptobenzamides only occurs via N-S bond coupling to access benzisothiazol-3-ones with moderate to good yields. This strategy features mild conditions, excellent chemoselectivity, and functional group compatibility, which has potential applications in organic and medicinal chemistry.

By developing electrochemical sensor with high sensitivity, where the glassy carbon electrode was decorated by C-Dots, the carbendazim was then determined by different pulse voltammetry. The Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) was used as an electrochemical probe to investigate the electrochemical specific property of the decorated electrode. The electron transfer on larger surface of electrode demonstrated faster rate in C-Dots/GCE than that on electrode with any functionalization. On the decorated electrode, the cycle voltammetry was employed to investigate the electrochemical carbendazim actions. The excellent performance in electrochemically oxidizing carbendazim is exhibited by C-Dots/GCE. With optimized condition, excellent linearity was observed in the well-established sensor of C-Dots/GCE by combining the peak current and carbendazim concentration, where the 10 nM was considered to be the limitation with the range (0.1-10 mu M). The carbendazim can be successfully and effectively determined in the water sample by using this proposed sensor.																			1452-3981					MAY	2017	12	5					3675	3685		10.20964/2017.05.55	http://dx.doi.org/10.20964/2017.05.55													WOS:000402485100010

Methods: Patients (n=84) treated with sustained hemodialysis were divided into two groups according to the random number grouping method. Patients (n=42) with peritoneal dialysis (PD) were selected as the observation group and patients (n=42) with hemodialysis (HD) were selected as the control group. Six months after the treatment, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, urea clearance index (Kt/V), hemoglobin, serum albumin, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (iPTH), inflammatory factors and oxidative stress factors were observed before and after dialysis. Results: After treatment, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and urea clearance index in the control group were lower than those in the observation group while hemoglobin and serum albumin were higher than those in the observation group (all P<0.05). There was no significant difference in serum calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone between the two groups after treatment. After treatment, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), malondialdehyde (MDA), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were lower, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was higher in the observation group than in the control group (all P<0.05). The incidence of complications of infection and hypoproteinemia in the observation group was higher than that in the control group, while the incidence of refractory hypertension, arrhythmia and congestive heart failure in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion: There are respective advantages of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Hemodialysis can effectively remove toxins and improve the nutritional status of patients, while peritoneal dialysis can improve microinflammation and oxidative stress. These two methods can be used according to the condition of patients.					wang, tingting/AAK-2640-2020														1940-5901						2020	13	10					7993	7999																WOS:000585185700099

Although it is well accepted that land application of PPMS has benefits for soils and crops, information on PPMS-induced soil N2O emissions is still limited. We assessed the effect of substituting mineral N fertilizer for PPMS on soil N2O emissions after a single application at planting on a clay loam cropped to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) over two snow-free seasons in eastern Canada. Fertilization treatments consisted of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of crop N requirements derived from N supplied by PPMS, the remaining N being supplied as urea-N. Soil CO2 and CH4 emissions were also measured and not affected by the fertilizer addition; a slight CH4 oxidation occurred. Area-based N2O emissions from PPMS fertilization (4.4 to 12.1 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) were similar or higher than from urea alone (3.4 and 6.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1)). Although crop yields were not affected by the type of fertilizer, yield-based N2O emissions, N uptake efficiency and N surplus (applied N minus aboveground N uptake in crop biomass) indicated that N availability from the mineral fertilizer was higher than from PPMS for the wheat crop. However, treatments with PPMS had fertilizer-induced N2O emission factors (FIEF, applied N lost as N2O-N; 0.8 to 3.1%) similar to urea alone (-0.3 and 4.5%). Although substituting urea-N with PPMS in agricultural fields might reduce N2O emissions under moderate soil moisture conditions, PPMS land application produced greater N2O emissions under high soil moisture conditions. Further research on a variety of agricultural practices is needed before concluding that including PPMS in the fertilization plan could result in a global GHG abatement as compared to mineral fertilizers under the cool climate of eastern Canada.

Optimizing the coordination environments of Ti active sites in TS-1 zeolite is a big challenge. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of a high-quality TS-1 zeolite without anatase Ti species via a hydrothermal method using urea as a mineralizer. The coordination environment of the Ti species in TS-1 zeolites was investigated via UV-vis and UV-Raman spectroscopies. The addition of urea changed the crystallization rate of TS-1 so that it matches the insertion rate of titanium and silicon into the framework, thereby avoiding the generation of anatase TiO2, and also the formation of defects simultaneously. It was found that the Au/TS-1-urea catalyst exhibits excellent performance in the direct gas phase epoxidation of propylene, with PO formation rate increasing to 140.32 g (h kg(cat))(-1) from 70.94 g (h kg(cat))(-1), almost twice compared with those of conventional Au/TS-1. Various ex and in situ characterization studies evidenced that the excellent activity is attributed to the high dispersion of tetra-coordinated titanium sites and the enhanced hydrophobicity with free defects. This facile synthetic strategy may open up new prospects for the design and synthesis of defect-free TS-1 zeolites and their potential applications in various selective oxidation reactions.

Self-assembled process with palladium nanoparticles (NPs) was successfully synthesized and used for the oxidation of glucose on glassy carbon electrodes. Based on the voltammetric and amperometric results, Pd NPs efficiently catalyzed the oxidation of glucose at - 0.05 V in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl and showed excellent resistance toward interference poisoning from such interfering species as ascorbic acid, uric acid and urea. To further increase sensitivity, the Pd NPs-PDDA-TiO2 NTs/GCE was electrochemically treated with H2SO4 and NaOH, the glucose oxidation current was magnified 2.5 times than that before pretreatments due to greatly enhancing the electron transport property of the sensor based on the increased defect sites and surface oxide species. In view of the physiological level of glucose, the wide linear concentration range of glucose (4 x 10(-7)-8 x 10(-4) M) with a detection limit of 8 x 10(-8) M (S/N = 3) was obviously good enough for clinical application.

J	Paragas, LKB; de Luna, MDG; Doong, RA				Paragas, Larah Kriselle B.; de Luna, Mark Daniel G.; Doong, Ruey-An			Rapid removal of sulfamethoxazole from simulated water matrix by visible-light responsive iodine and potassium co-doped graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysts	CHEMOSPHERE												An environment-friendly iodine and potassium co-doped g-C3N4 (IK-C3N4) photocatalyst was synthesized via the co-pyrolysis of urea and potassium iodate. Various characterization techniques were employed to evaluate the physical, thermal and chemical characteristics of the as-synthesized photo catalyst. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was used as a representative antibiotic pollutant. SMX removal by IK-C3N4 photocatalysts exceeded 99% (similar to 23 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4) within 45 min of visible light irradiation. The kinetics of SMX removal was analyzed with respect to solution pH, photocatalyst dosage and initial SMX concentration. Experimental data was found to fit the pseudo-first order kinetics and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. The reuse of the photocatalyst up to 3 consecutive photo degradation cycles gave a minimal decline in SMX removal while the structure and the crystallinity of the nanomaterials remained unchanged. Overall, morphology engineering of conventional bulk graphitic carbon nitride can produce highly efficient photocatalysts for the decontamination of antibiotics in the aqueous environment.

To address this issue and enhance energy efficiency in hydrogen generation, we explored a high-activity alkaline HER catalyst while concurrently coupling it with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this work, we designed and synthesized porous molybdenum (Mo)-modulated nickel-cobalt bimetallic phosphide nanoarrays (M0.3NCP@NF). This multifunctional selfsupported electrocatalyst demonstrates superior performance in HER, OER, and UOR. The introduction of Mo, in the form of CoMoO4 nanoparticles, promotes interfacial electron transfer to reduce the electron density around the cations in phosphides, enhancing the kinetics and intrinsic activity. Furthermore, the morphological changes induced by Mo accelerate both electron and mass transfer processes. Density functional theory and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicate that Mo introduction optimizes the interaction with HER intermediate H*, facilitating the conversion to a high-valent active intermediate for OER and accelerating UOR kinetics. Benefiting from dual optimization of morphology and structure, the as-prepared M0.3NCP@NF electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding HER, OER, and UOR performances. Notably, a full urea electrolysis device powered by M0.3NCP@NF operates with a cell voltage of only 1.53 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). which is 240 mV lower than that of conventional water electrolysis, demonstrating the competitive potential of our approach for efficient and energy-saving hydrogen production, along with simultaneous urea wastewater remediation.

Methods: Clinical data from 93 PE patients who established health records and delivered newborns at Xingtai People's Hospital between January 2017 and September 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were categorized into mild a PE group (n = 51) and severe a PE group (n = 42) based on the severity of their condition, and also into an early-onset PE group (n = 38, gestational weeks < 34) and a late-onset PE group (n = 55, gestational weeks >= 34) by the timing of onset. Additionally, 50 healthy pregnant women undergoing routine prenatal check-ups during the same period were selected as the control group. Pearson's correlation was used to analyze the correlation of VA and VE levels with blood lipids, liver and kidney functions, and oxidative stress injury indices in PE patients. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the value of serum VA and VE levels in evaluating early-onset PE and adverse pregnancy outcomes in PE patients. Results: Pearson correlation analysis revealed that VA and VE levels in PE patients had negative correlation with total cholesterol (r = -3.426, -4.812), triglycerides (r = -3.862, -5.321), low-density lipoprotein (r = -4.065, -4.916), serum creatinine (r = -4.967, -5.437), blood urea nitrogen (r = -5.074, -4.653), uric acid (r = -4.716, -5.384), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) (r = -6.132, -5.876), myeloperoxidase (r = -6.812, -6.732), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (r = -5.862, -4.762), and reactive oxygen species levels (r = -3.716, -4.352, all P < 0.05), and they had a positive correlation with high-density lipoprotein (r = 5.132, 4.932), catalase (r = 4.165, 3.135), and superoxide dismutase levels (r = 5.621, 4.997, all P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) values for predicting early-onset PE were 0.847 for VA, 0.891 for VE, and 0.908 for the combination. For predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes in PE, the AUC values were 0.897, 0.924, and 0.931, respectively. Conclusions: Serum VA and VE levels are closely related to PE severity, lipid levels, renal function, AOPP, and other oxidative stress injury markers in PE patients. Combined detection of VA and VE levels can help assess early-onset PE and adverse pregnancy outcomes.																			1943-8141						2024	16	9					4601	4611		10.62347/QQKA9766	http://dx.doi.org/10.62347/QQKA9766								39398573					WOS:001327170100025

However, the energy consumption of this method comes mainly from the slow anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacement of the OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) enables energy-efficient hydrogen production, avoiding dangerous H-2/O-2 mixtures due to the release of N-2 and CO2 at the anode. Hence, it is crucial to investigate efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts to assist OER in combination with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in improving the energy efficiency of hydrogen production. In this work, we take a feasible strategy to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) highly active catalysts CoSe2/MoSe2 grown on carbon cloth (CoSe2/MoSe2@CC). Taking advantage of synergistic interaction between interfaces, CoSe2/MoSe2@CC exhibits a promising overpotential of 71 and 320 mV for HER and OER at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, CoSe2/MoSe2@CC-4 also showed prominent catalytic activity against UOR in 1 M KOH with 0.3 M urea. An electrolyzer is also constructed via using CoSe2/MoSe2@CC as both electrodes. It is worth mentioning that the electrolyzer CoSe2/MoSe2@CC parallel to CoSe2/MoSe2@CC in 1 M KOH with 0.3 M urea obtains a battery voltage of 1.48 V to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 0.17 V lower than that in 1 M KOH (1.65). This electrolyzer completed relatively conspicuous durability in an alkaline electrolyte solution of 1 M KOH, with maintenance of initial current density through 24 h of continuous operation at a constant cell voltage for water splitting. This work develops a promising multifunctional catalyst for urea-assisted hydrogen generation from water electrolysis, which can reduce the decomposition potential of water electrolysis.

However, this hypothesis has not been thoroughly explored. This study investigated the Cd biotransformation and accumulation in wheat growing under a hydroponic system regulated by various nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) fertilizers, after treatment with green-synthesized nano-zero-valent iron supported by diatomite (GnZVI@DE) composites. We found that the presence of urea-N and P with GnZVI@DE respectively inhibited Cd accumulation by 67.7% and 26.2% in wheat seedlings, alleviating further oxidative damage to wheat. This was because urea-N promoted the dispersion of GnZVI@DE particles that originated from increased steric hindrance. P induced the polyphosphate production on tea polyphenols covering GnZVI@DE, increasing Cd(ii) adsorption and precipitation by 47.9% for lesser uptake by root surfaces. Conversely, nitrate-N and ammonium-N promoted Cd accumulation in wheat shoots by 86.0% and 26.3%. This was mainly attributed to reduced Cd immobilization by nanocomposites due to GnZVI@DE oxidation by nitrate and competitive adsorption by ammonium. Our study provides insights for developing a sustainable strategy for the remediation of Cd-contaminated soils and the healthy growth of wheat achieved by the synergistic force of nano-amendments combined with urea and phosphate fertilizers. A sustainable approach for agricultural production using green-synthesized nano-amendments together with fertilizer management synergistically inhibited Cd accumulation in wheat.

The flexible catalytic electrode was a composite of Au/Ni-P/ polyethylene terephthalate (PET). ScCO2 was used as the solvent in the catalyzation step of an electroless plating process. Palladium bis-hexafluoroacetylacetonate was used as the source of the palladium catalyst for the high solubility in scCO2. After the catalyzation step, Ni-P was firstly deposited on the catalyzed PET as the sacrificial layer for the later gold deposition. Electrical resistance of the Ni-P/PET composite was 0.27 0 and maintained at 0.30 0 after a tape adhesion test, which revealed the positive contribution of the scCO2 catalyzation on reliability of the metallized PET. After deposition of the gold layer, the flexible Au/Ni-P/PET composite was evaluated as the catalytic electrode in oxidation of urea, ascorbic acid and glucose to demonstrate the applicability in flexible biosensors.

Comparative genomics sheds light on niche differentiation and the evolutionary history of comammox Nitrospira	ISME JOURNAL												The description of comammox Nitrospira spp., performing complete ammonia-to-nitrate oxidation, and their co-occurrence with canonical beta-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizing bacteria (beta-AOB) in the environment, calls into question the metabolic potential of comammox Nitrospira and the evolutionary history of their ammonia oxidation pathway. We report four new comammox Nitrospira genomes, constituting two novel species, and the first comparative genomic analysis on comammox Nitrospira. Unlike canonical Nitrospira, comammox Nitrospira genomes lack genes for assimilatory nitrite reduction, suggesting that they have lost the potential to use external nitrite nitrogen sources. By contrast, compared to canonical Nitrospira, comammox Nitrospira harbor a higher diversity of urea transporters and copper homeostasis genes and lack cyanate hydratase genes. Additionally, the two comammox clades differ in their ammonium uptake systems. Contrary to beta-AOB, comammox Nitrospira genomes have single copies of the two central ammonia oxidation pathway operons. Similar to ammonia oxidizing archaea and some oligotrophic AOB strains, they lack genes involved in nitric oxide reduction. Furthermore, comammox Nitrospira genomes encode genes that might allow efficient growth at low oxygen concentrations. Regarding the evolutionary history of comammox Nitrospira, our analyses indicate that several genes belonging to the ammonia oxidation pathway could have been laterally transferred from beta-AOB to comammox Nitrospira. We postulate that the absence of comammox genes in other sublineage II Nitrospira genomes is the result of subsequent loss.

By utilizing eco-friendly bio-electricity in situ, the MFC-PM process could activate the simultaneous anodic biological metabolism of urea and the cathodic electro-permanganate process. Density functional analysis and experimental evidence revealed the reactive manganese species (Mn(VII)(aq), Mn(VI)(aq), Mn(V)(aq), and Mn(III)(aq)), generated via single electron transfer, contributed to diclofenac degradation in the cathodic chamber. The sites of diclofenac with a high Fukui index were preferable to be attacked by reactive manganese species, and diclofenac degradation was mainly accomplished through the ring hydroxylation, ring opening, and decarboxylation processes. Biological detection revealed clostridia were the primary electron donor in the anode chamber in an anaerobic environment. Furthermore, maximum output power density of 1.49 W m(-3) and the optimal removal of 94.75% diclofenac were obtained within 20 min under the conditions of pH = 3.0, [DCF](0) = 60 mu M, and [PM](0) = 30 mu M. Diclofenac removal efficiency increased with external resistance, higher PM dosage, and lower catholyte pH. In addition, the MFC-PM process displayed excellent applicability in urine and other background substances. The MFC-PM process provided an efficient and energy-free bio-electricity catalytic permanganate oxidation technology for enhancing diclofenac degradation.

J	Kim, YJ; Kim, PS; Kim, CH				Kim, Young Jin; Kim, Pyung Soon; Kim, Chang Hwan			Deactivation mechanism of Cu/Zeolite SCR catalyst under high-temperature rich operation condition	APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL												Selective catalytic reduction of NOx by urea (urea/SCR) and Lean NOx Trap (LNT) are two leading technologies for NOx reduction under lean condition. To quickly warm up SCR catalysts, considerable efforts have been made in integrating SCR onto a diesel particulate filter, so called SDPF. With the fact that the real driving emission test has taken effect, SDPF coupled with LNT might be one of most viable solutions to meet stringent emission regulations. However, desulfation process for LNT may result in a severe deactivation of SDPF in downstream. Here, we investigated the tolerance of Cu/zeolite SCR catalysts against periodic lean/rich operation condition simulating desulfation over LNT in front of SDPF. The lean/rich aging at 620 degrees C has led a severe deterioration of NOx conversion over Cu/SSZ-13 hydrothermally aged 800 degrees C, especially in high-temperature region above 400 degrees C. The accelerated NH3 oxidation to NO was the primary cause for the poor NOx removal activity, originated from the alteration of Cu state. Cu ions turned out to be converted to CuOx cluster upon their exposure to rich condition, which could partly be re-dispersed as Cu2+ ion after the post-treatment at 700 degrees C under lean condition. Cu/SSZ-13 with low Cu content revealed better activity maintenance under the high-temperature rich condition compared to higher Cu loading counterpart. Cu/LTA recently developed showed superior tolerance against rich feed due to less reducible nature of Cu+ ion therein compared to that in Cu/SSZ-13 leading to less CuOx formation.

For that purpose, the starting AC was oxidized with HNO3 of various concentrations, modified with urea and doped with 0.5 wt.% of Ce. It was observed that the increased concentration of acid influenced the catalytic activity, since textural and surface chemistry of activated carbon was changed. The most active sample was that modified with 14 M HNO3 and it reached 96% of NO conversion at 300 degrees C. Additionally, the addition of Ce improved the catalytic performance of modified AC, and NO was reduced according to oxidation-reduction mechanism, characteristic for supported metal oxides.

Here, a trimetallic electrocatalyst with a dendritic nanostructure, which is denoted as NiMoCu-NF, was fabricated on nickel foam via a gas-template electrodeposition strategy. By virtue of the metallic doping and structural optimization, NiMoCu-NF exhibits superior HER electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 52 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the NiMoCu-NF-derived nickel-based (oxy)hydroxide species in the oxidation operating state deliver considerable electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance to match the efficient H-2 generation, with a low voltage of 1.54 V to realize overall electrolysis at 50 mA cm(-2). Impressively, combined experimental and simulation analysis demonstrate that the NiMoCu-NF with a favorable 3D nanostructure feature effectively regulates the heterogeneous interface states, inducing a "Gas Microfluidic Pumping" (GMP) effect that improved electron-mass transfer properties to accelerate the electrocatalytic reaction kinetics of either the HER or UOR.

Urea at a rate of 100 mg N kg(-1) soil was applied to soil microcosms (high nutrient tenosol and low nutrient hydrosol) which were treated with either no inhibitor (urea-only); 15 mg DCD kg(-1) soil or 15 mg DCD kg(-1) soil plus 21 mg GTU kg soil(-1). Mineral N (NH4+ & NO3-) concentrations, potential nitrification rates (PNR) and abundances of ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) were measured over time. After 100-days incubation, similar to 73 mg N kg(-1) soil was found as NH4+ when urea + DCD + GTU were applied to the tenosol. NH4+ concentrations were lower (11-32 mg N kg(-1) soil) when urea or urea + DCD were applied. This suggests that the application of GTU in conjunction with DCD elongated the effects of nitrification inhibition. In both soils, PNRs were faster and AOB abundances (gene copies g(-1) soil) were higher when urea was applied without nitrification inhibitors. There were, however, no differences in PNR or AOB abundances in either soil type when 'urea + DCD' or 'urea + DCD + GTU' were applied. The results indicate that the application of GTU with DCD may extend nitrification inhibition in certain soil types. This finding has the potential to improve the efficacy of commercially available and widely used inhibitors such as DCD. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, it remains unclear whether niche specialization of AOA and AOB occurs in rice paddy wetlands constrained by oxygen availability. Using DNA-based stable isotope probing, we conclude that AOA dominated nitrification activity in acidic paddy soils (pH 5.6) while AOB dominated in alkaline soils (pH 8.2). Nitrification activity was stimulated by urea fertilization and accompanied by a significant increase of AOA in acid soils and AOB in alkaline soils. DNA-based stable isotope probing indicated significant assimilation of (CO2)-C-13 for AOA only in acidic paddy soil, while AOB was the solely responsible for ammonia oxidation in the alkaline paddy soil. Phylogenetic analysis further indicated that AOA members within the soil group 1.1b lineage dominated nitrification in acid soils. Ammonia oxidation in the alkaline soil was catalyzed by Nitrosospira cluster 3-like AOB, suggesting that the physiological diversity of AOA is more complicated than previously thought, and soil pH plays important roles in shaping the community structures of ammonia oxidizers in paddy field.

J	Li, YH; Huang, WS				Li, Yaohua; Huang, Wensheng			Electrode modified with porous alumina microfibers as a highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for quercetin	ANALYTICAL METHODS												Porous alumina microfibers were prepared via a hydrothermal reaction using Al(NO3) and urea as the precursors. The resulting alumina microfibers were used to modify a carbon paste electrode and to construct a new electrochemical sensor for quercetin. The modified alumina microfibers greatly increased the oxidation signals of quercetin, showing strong signal enhancement effects. The influence of pH, the amount of alumina microfibers, the accumulation potential and the accumulation time on the oxidation peak currents of quercetin were examined. A highly sensitive, rapid and reliable electrochemical method was developed for the determination of quercetin. The linear range was from 25 nM to 1.5 mu M and the detection limit was 10 nM (3.02 mu g L-1) after 1 min of accumulation time. The proposed method was used to determine quercetin in different samples of tea and honeysuckle and the obtained results were in good agreement with those obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Methods: Ninety clean, healthy male SD rats were randomly selected as control group, model group, TGP low-dose group (low-dose group), TGP high-dose group (high-dose group), TLR/MyD88 signal pathway inhibitor group (TAK242 group) and JAK/STAT signal pathway inhibitor group (AG490 group). The general conditions, 24-hr urinary albumin, endogenous creatinine clearance, urea nitrogen level, renal histopathological changes, oxidation factor level and pathway-related factor level were observed for the rats in each group. Results: Compared with the control group, the levels of fasting blood glucose and renal weight/body weight in the model group were significantly higher (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, with the increase of drug dose and concentration, the levels of fasting blood glucose, renal weight/body weight, 24-hr urinary albumin, urea nitrogen, malondialdehyde (MDA), toll-like receptor 4 (p-TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor (p-MyD88), Janus kinase (p-JAK2) and signal transduction nuclear transcription activating factor (p-STAT3) decreased significantly, endogenous creatinine clearance and superoxide dismutase (SOD) After inhibiting the TLR/MyD88 and JAK/STAT signalling pathways, the levels of fasting blood glucose, renal weight/body weight, 24-hr urinary albumin, urea nitrogen, MDA, p-TLR4, p-MyD88, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 decreased significantly, and the endogenous creatinine clearance rate and SOD level increased significantly. Compared with the control group, the renal tissue of the model group showed obvious glomerular mesangial matrix expansion and glomerular oedema. The capsule narrowed and the positive areas of Schiff's periodate staining increased significantly. The renal tissue of rats in the low-dose and high-dose groups improved in varying degrees, and the improvement was obvious in the high-dose group; after inhibiting TLR/MyD88 and JAK/STAT signal pathway, the renal tissue of the rats improved significantly. Conclusion: Total glucosides of paeony can inhibit the increase of blood glucose and inhibit the level of oxidation factor in rats, which may improve the early renal damage in diabetic rats. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of TLR/MyD88 and JAK/STAT signalling pathway.																			0393-6384	2283-9720					2022	38	4					2459	2465		10.19193/0393-6384_2022_4_373	http://dx.doi.org/10.19193/0393-6384_2022_4_373													WOS:000884059600038

In this study, we investigated the effects of acetic acid on endurance capacity and muscle oxidative metabolism in the exercise training using in vivo mice model. In exercised mice, acetic acid induced a significant increase in endurance capacity accompanying a reduction in visceral adipose depots. Serum levels of non-esterified fatty acid and urea nitrogen were significantly lower in acetic acid-fed mice in the exercised mice. Importantly, in the mice, acetic acid significantly increased the muscle expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation and glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type transformation. Taken together, these findings suggest that acetic acid improves endurance exercise capacity by promoting muscle oxidative properties, in part through the AMPK-mediated fatty acid oxidation and provide an important basis for the application of acetic acid as a major component of novel ergogenic aids.

The good conjugation between PANI nanoparticles and MWNTs-COOH resulted in significant electrochemical performance variation of the obtained films. In addition, the assembled MWNT-COOH/PANI/ITO showed synergistic effect to the electrochemical oxidation of nifedipine (NIF) when used as a sensor. Compared with bare ITO, the oxidation potential of NIF can be decreased about 170 mV on MWNT-COOH/PANI/ITO, and the lower detection limit of NIF was as low as 1.0 x 10(-6) mol/L. In addition, the assembled electrode gave no responses to interferences such as glucose, urea, ascorbic acid, and trisodium citrate, which showed high selectivity for recognition and quantification of NIF.

Hydrogen bond containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes in polyurethane composites	POLYMER COMPOSITES												Introduction of hydrogen bonding sites onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) included carboxylic acid, amide-amine, and novel amide-urea MWCNTs for the formation of homogenous polyurethane composites. Acid oxidation and subsequent derivatization introduced hydrogen bonding functionality onto MWCNTs to reveal the effect of surface functionalization on mechanical properties in a 45 wt% hard segment polyurethane matrix. Raman spectroscopy showed an increase in the D/G peak ratio, which indicated successful oxidation, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also revealed elemental compositions that supported each step of the functionalization strategy. Thermogravimetric analysis supported functionalization with an increase in percent weight loss for each functionalization, and the MWCNT surface functionalization determined pH-dependent dispersibility. The nonfunctionalized MWCNT composites showed poor dispersion with transmission electron microscopy, and in sharp contrast, the functionalized composites displayed homogenous dispersions. Tensile testing revealed improved stress at break in the functionalized MWCNT composites at low loadings due to homogenous dispersion. POLYM. COMPOS., 37:1425-1434, 2016.

As a potential electrocatalyst, the improvement of HER performance catalyzed by nanostructured transition metal phosphides still remains a great challenge. Tuning the novel nanostructure, morphology, and electronic state from nanoscale is of great important to achieve highly efficient HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we first developed an electronic structure and d-band center control engineering for accelerating the HER process in both acid and alkaline media over M-doped CoP (M = Ni, Mn, Fe) hollow polyhedron frames (HPFs), which were synthesized by a self-templating transformation (STT) strategy. Impressively, the HER electrocatalytic activity can be maximumly promoted and maintained at least 21 h for Ni-CoP/HPFs catalyst. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, auger electron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations consistently reveal the improved performance is attributed to the changes of the electronic structure and the downshift of d-band center after metal doping. The Ni-CoP/HPFs catalyst also indicates excellent activity with a cell voltage of 1.43 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and superior stability when it was employed as a cathode for HER and an anode for urea oxidation in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. The success modulation of HER performance in current SIT strategy will provide a promising pathway for designing various transition metal-doped compounds for energy-related catalysis processes.

A composite of both components was used to modify the surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) designated as (CU/MWCNT/Gr/GCE). CU-functionalized CNMs modified GCs have shown higher catalytic activity towards the oxidation of nitrite (NO2-) compared to bare and pristine CNM modified electrodes. However, the highest performance was found for a mixture of Gr and MWCNT (50% w/w). CU-functionalized CNMs were characterized by scanning electron microscope, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. It has been hypothesized that covalent functionalization and exfoliation were responsible for the improvement in electrocatalytic activity of the modified electrode.

The catalytic activity data collected under realistic operating conditions, representative of the after-treatment system of lean-burn vehicles, were compared to those obtained adding methane to the gas feed stream in order to assess the impact of this hydrocarbon, which is usually emitted from natural gas engines, on the NH3-SCR catalytic chemistry. Our results indicate a negligible impact of methane on the SCR activity at all conditions, but in the presence of a large excess of NO2 at T>400 degrees C due to methane oxidation by NO2. The data collected over the two individual metal-promoted zeolites were also compared with those obtained combining both catalysts in sequential arrangements, in order to take advantage of their complementary high activities in different temperature ranges. The Fe-zeolite+Cu-zeolite sequence outperformed the two individual components in terms of both overall deNOx efficiency and N2O selectivity, and was equally insensitive to methane.

The catalytic activity was evaluated for the decomposition of H2O2 through the photo-Fenton process in sunlight. The urea-synthesized sample showed an usually large photo-Fenton effect and the catalyst could be easily recovered and reused due to its ferromagnetic behaviour.																			0250-4707	0973-7669				OCT	2019	42	5							254	10.1007/s12034-019-1899-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12034-019-1899-9													WOS:000480769000001

Methionine residues in proteins are highly prone to oxidation and get converted into methionine sulfoxide (MetO). Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) can improve the functionality of spermatozoa by reducing the MetO to methionine restoring the lost functionality of the affected proteins. Objective: The expression of catalytically active recombinant MsrA (rMsrA). Methods: The msrA gene was PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced. Further, the recombinant clone was used for protein expression and purification. The protein was getting precipitated during dialysis in Tris-buffer. Hence, the purified rMsrA was dialyzed at 4 degrees C against the Tris-buffer pH 7.5 containing MgCl2, KCl, NaCl, urea and triton X-100. During dialysis, changes of buffer were done at every 12 h interval with stepwise reduction in the concentrations of NaCl, urea and triton X-100. The final dialysis was done with buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2, 30 mM KCl, and 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. The activity of the rMsrA was checked spectrophotometrically. Results: The protein BLAST of buffalo MsrA with bovine sequence showed 14 amino acid mismatches. The rMsrA has been purified under denaturing conditions as it was forming inclusion bodies consistently during protein expression. After renaturation, the purified 33 kDa rMsrA was catalytically active by biochemical assay. Conclusion: The rMsrA expressed in prokaryotic system is catalytically active and can be used for supplementation to semen extender to repair the oxidatively damaged seminal plasma proteins that occur during cryopreservation.

Protein Intake to Maximize Whole-Body Anabolism during Postexercise Recovery in Resistance-Trained Men with High Habitual Intakes is Severalfold Greater than the Current Recommended Dietary Allowance	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION												Background: Dietary protein supports resistance exercise-induced anabolism primarily via the stimulation of protein synthesis rates. The indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique provides a noninvasive estimate of the protein intake that maximizes whole-body protein synthesis rates and net protein balance. Objective: We utilized IAAO to determine the maximal anabolic response to postexercise protein ingestion in resistance-trained men. Methods: Seven resistance-trained men (mean +/- SD age 24 +/- 3 y; weight 80 +/- 9 kg; 11 +/- 5% body fat; habitual protein intake 2.3 +/- 0.6 g.kg(-1).d(-1)) performed a bout of whole-body resistance exercise prior to ingesting hourly mixed meals, which provided a variable amount of protein (0.20-3.00 g.kg(-1).d(-1)) as crystalline amino acids modeled after egg protein. Steady-state protein kinetics were modeled with oral L-(1-(13C)]-phenylalanine. Breath and urine samples were taken at isotopic steady state to determine phenylalanine flux (PheRa), phenylalanine excretion ((FCO2)-C-13; reciprocal of protein synthesis), and net balance (protein synthesis - PheRa). Total amino acid oxidation was estimated from the ratio of urinary urea and creatinine. Results: Mixed model biphasic linear regression revealed a plateau in (FCO2)-C-13 (mean: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.62, 2.38 g protein.kg(-1).d(-1)) (r(2)= 0.64; P < 0.011 and in net balance (mean: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.44, 2.57 g protein.kg(-1).d(-1)) (r(2)= 0.63; P < 0.01). Ratios of urinary urea and creatinine concentrations increased linearly (r = 0.84; P < 0.01) across the range of protein intakes. Conclusions: A breakpoint protein intake of similar to 2.0 g.kg(-1).d(-1), which maximized whole-body anabolism in resistance-trained men after exercise, is greater than previous IAAO-derived estimates for nonexercising men and is at the upper range of current general protein recommendations for athletes. The capacity to enhance whole-body net balance may be greater than previously suggested to maximize muscle protein synthesis in resistance-trained athletes accustomed to a high habitual protein intake.

The threat of ammonia has been increasing with rising anthropogenic activities including intensified aquaculture. In this study, we aimed to investigate ammonia toxicity and metabolism mechanisms in the hepatopancreas, a major organ for Vitellogenin (Vtg) synthesis and defending against ammonia stress, of female swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus which is an important fishery and aquaculture species, by integrating physiological, transcriptome and metabolome analyses. The results revealed that ammonia exposure (10 mg/L, an environmentally relevant concentration) resulted in a remarkable reduction in vtg expression and depression of multiple signaling pathways for reproductive regulators including methyl farnesoate, ecdysone and neuroparsin, demonstrating for the first time that ammonia impairs swimming crab female reproduction. In addition, a number of important genes and metabolites in glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, fatty acid beta-oxidation and synthesis were significantly downregulated, indicating that changes in ammonia levels lead to a general depression of energy metabolism in hepatopancreas. After ammonia exposure, an increased level of urea and a reduction of amino acid catabolism were observed in hepatopancreas, suggesting that urea cycle was utilized to biotransform ammonia, and amino acid catabolism was decreased to reduce endogenous ammonia generation. Furthermore, antioxidant systems were altered following ammonia exposure, which was accompanied by proteins and lipid oxidations, as well as cellular apoptosis. These results indicate that ammonia leads to metabolic suppression, oxidative stress and apoptosis in P. trituberculatus hepatopancreas. The findings improve the understanding for the mechanisms of ammonia toxicity and metabolism in P. trituberculatus, and provide valuable information for assessing potential ecological risk of environmental ammonia and improving aquaculture management.

Protein carbamylation and cardiovascular disease	KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL												Carbamylation constitutes a posttranslational modification of proteins or amino acids and results from different pathways in vivo. First is the non-enzymatic reaction between isocyanic acid, a decomposition product of urea, and either the N-terminus or the epsilon-amino group of lysine residues. Isocyanic acid levels, while low in vivo, are in equilibrium with urea and are thus increased in chronic and end-stage renal diseases. An alternative pathway involves the leukocyte heme protein myeloperoxidase, which catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, producing isocyanate at inflammation sites. Notably, plasma thiocyanate levels are increased in smokers, and leukocyte-driven protein carbamylation occurs both within human and animal atherosclerotic plaques, as well as on plasma proteins. Protein carbamylation is considered a hallmark of molecular aging and is implicated in many pathological conditions. Recently, it has been shown that carbamylated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) induces endothelial dysfunction via lectin-like-oxidized LDL receptor-1 activation and increased reactive oxygen species production, leading to endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling. Moreover, carbamylated LDL harbors atherogenic activities, including both binding to macrophage scavenger receptors inducing cholesterol accumulation and foam-cell formation, as well as promoting vascular smooth muscle proliferation. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein loses its anti-apoptotic activity after carbamylation, contributing to endothelial cell death. In addition to involvement in atherogenesis, protein carbamylation levels have emerged as a particularly strong predictor of both prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease risk. Recent studies also suggest that protein carbamylation may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease.

Electrochemical nonenzymatic glucose sensors catalyzed by Au nanoclusters on metallic nanotube arrays and polypyrrole nanowires	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												Monitoring blood glucose level is critical, since its abnormality leads to diabetes and causes death, even though glucose is essential for human living. Herein, the sensing study was performed on electrochemical nonenzymatic glucose sensors, which are composed of an Au nanocluster (AuNC) catalyst deposited on a metallic nanotube array (MeNTA) and polypyrrole nanowire (PPyNW). The AuNC was produced by irradiating a femtosecond pulse laser to the Au precursor solution, and it is a simple and facile method. The successful deposition of AuNC on both MeNTA and PPyNW was confirmed by means of the surface morphology and the Au content increase. On the exploration by cyclic voltammetry in alkaline condition, AuNC/MeNTA electrodes showed better performance than AuNC/PPyNW electrodes: The former was a remarkable electrocatalytic detector towards glucose oxidation with better sensitivity, lower detection limit, wider linear range, and longer-term stability without interference from potential interfering agents such as ascorbic acid, urea, NaCl, KCl, etc. Moreover, nonenzymatic AuNC/MeNTA electrodes exhibited high precision and accuracy in real human blood samples and, thus, can be a promising candidate in glucose sensing applications.

Herein, we highlight that an in situ grown nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheet array catalyst with partially amorphous characteristics, rich native Ni3+ ions and an optimal Ni:Fe ratio can exhibit robust performances on both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Benefitting from the partially amorphous feature, the catalytically active high-valence species are easy to generate and stabilize, thus further realizing enhanced electrooxidation activity with the aid of an internal 2D charge transfer pathway and native Ni3+ ions. As expected, the partially amorphous catalyst exhibits a higher OER current of 284.4 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 500 mV, which shows 2.2-10.0 times enhancement than the counterparts with various Ni:Fe ratios. In addition, the UOR current density of the partially amorphous catalyst at 1.8 V vs. RHE shows 1.6 and 2.4 times increment relative to fully amorphous and highly crystalline catalysts, and 2.7-9.4 fold larger than the catalysts with other Ni:Fe ratios. The optimization strategy of designing the partially amorphous bifunctional catalyst in this work may broaden the way of searching for advanced electrocatalysts for simultaneous waste water treatment and clean energy production.

Photo-Fenton approach for the determination of organic nitrogen in rainwater	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The importance of taking the organic forms of nitrogen (ON) into account when estimating atmospheric nitrogen deposition has been known for a long time. However, there is still only a modest amount of data on organic nitrogen in rainwater worldwide, largely due to the difficulties and uncertainties imposed by the available analytical methods. This work offers a simple, low cost, and reliable method for the determination of ON in rainwater, based on the photo-Fenton process under UV irradiation. The recovery of ON was determined using individual solutions of urea, serine, glycine, and histidine, as well as a mixture of all these compounds plus arginine. Close to 100% organic nitrogen recoveries were obtained for solutions containing 50 mol N L-1, using addition of 50 molL(-1) Fe2+ and 2.0 mmol L-1 H2O2, with adjustment of the pH to similar to 2.5 and irradiation for 90 min. The average reagent blank was < 2.0 mol N L-1. The homemade reactor employed a 400 W high pressure mercury lamp, from which the external bulb had been manually removed. The reactor ventilation was controlled in order to maintain the temperature at - 85 degrees C. The precision of the method ranged from 1.3 to 5.7%, based on ON recovery. Rainwater collected on an event basis in Ribeirao Preto (Sao Paulo State, Brazil) presented ON concentrations from 4.1 to 34.3 nmol L-1 (n = 18), corresponding to 13-45% of the total nitrogen, with an average contribution of 33%. Precision of s <= 7.0% was obtained for the analysis of ON in rainwater.

Those materials possess good catalytic activity toward glucose oxidation in 0.1 x phosphate buffered saline as well as resistance to some interferants, such as ascorbic acid, urea, and glycine. The electrodes are further coated with three different polymers, that is, Nafion, photo-crosslinked poly(zwitterions) based on sulfobetaine methacrylate, and a hybrid membrane consisting of both polymers. Both the optimal integrity of the material and its catalytic activity toward glucose oxidation were maintained by the hybrid membranes with a large excess of poly(zwitterions) (mass ratio 20:1). The chemical structures of the as-formed membranes are confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Due to the zwitterionic nature of the coating, the electrodes are resistant to biofouling and maintain electrochemical activity toward glucose for 4 days. Moreover, due to the synergistic effect of both Nafion and poly(zwitterions), the interference from the two compounds, namely, from acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen, was diminished. Besides the presence of polymer membranes, the electrode possesses a sensitivity of 36.8 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) in the linear range of 0.4-12 mM, while the limit of detection was estimated to be 23 mu M. Finally, the electrodes are stable, and their response is not altered even by 1,000 bending cycles.

Nitrogen Sources and Iron Availability Affect Pigment Biosynthesis and Nutrient Consumption in Anabaena sp. UTEX 2576	MICROORGANISMS												Anabaena sp. UTEX 2576 metabolizes multiple nitrogen (N) sources and is deemed a biotechnological platform for chemical production. Cyanobacteria have been identified as prolific producers of biofertilizers, biopolymers, biofuels, and other bioactive compounds. Here, we analyze the effect of different N-sources and Fe availability on the bioproduction of phycobiliproteins and beta-carotene. We characterize nutrient demand in modified BG11 media, including data on CO2 fixation rates, N-source consumption, and mineral utilization (e.g., phosphorus (P), and 11 metallic elements). Results suggest that non-diazotrophic cultures grow up to 60% faster than diazotrophic cells, resulting in 20% higher CO2-fixation rates. While the production of beta-carotene was maximum in medium with NaNO3, Fe starvation increased the cellular abundance of C-phycocyanin and allophycocyanin by at least 22%. Compared to cells metabolizing NaNO3 and N-2, cultures adapted to urea media increased their P, calcium and manganese demands by at least 72%, 97% and 76%, respectively. Variations on pigmentation and nutrient uptake were attributed to changes in phycocyanobilin biosynthesis, light-induced oxidation of carotenoids, and urea-promoted peroxidation. This work presents insights into developing optimal Anabaena culture for efficient operations of bioproduction and wastewater bioremediation with cyanobacteria.

The robustness of the pincer Ru complexes and norvaline scaffolds against acidic/basic, oxidizing, and high-temperature conditions enabled us to perform selective transformations of the N-Boc and C-OMe termini into various functional groups, such as alkyl amide, alkyl urea, and polyether groups, without the loss of the Ru center or enantiomeric purity. The resulting dialkylated Ru-bound norvaline, n-C11H23CO-l-[Ru(pydc)(terpy)]Nva-NH-n-C11H23 (l-4) was found to have excellent self-assembly properties in organic solvents, thereby affording the corresponding supramolecular gels.

In this work p-C3N4 was synthesized from urea or ferric chloride/urea by pyrolysis followed by a post-treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The prepared materials were characterized by physico-chemical methods in order to study their structural and electronic features. The characterization results revealed that iron was present in p-C3N4 as a Fe3O4 phase. The H2O2 treatment did not only modify the p-C3N4 framework through the generation of oxygen functional groups and defect sites but it also affected the size, distribution, and oxidation state of iron oxide. The photocatalytic activity of the catalysts was tested through the degradation of methyl orange under visible and white light irradiation. In comparison, the iron oxide containing p-C3N4 post-treated with H2O2 sample shows superior photocatalytic performance towards methyl orange degradation. This might be attributed to the valence and conduction band levels of the composite material, an inhibited recombination of photogenerated charge carriers as well as a synergistic effect of iron species and the oxygen containing functional groups or defects present in p-C3N4.

Here, we design a porous nanosheet array catalyst of spherical Co3S4 and Ni-Fe sulfide nanosheets grown vertically on FeNi3 foam (NiFeCoSx@FeNi3) with excellent catalytic activity and stability in alkaline solutions. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the current densities of the HER and OER can reach 10 mA cm(-2) with minimum overpotentials of 88 mV and 210 mV, respectively. In 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea solutions, NiFeCoSx@FeNi3 needs only 1.42 V to provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The significantly improved catalytic activity should be attributed to the synergistic interaction among the three elements of Ni, Fe and Co as well as the hierarchical porous nanosheet array structure. This work demonstrates that a novel and efficient bifunctional trimetallic catalyst can be rationally designed by controlling the composition and ratio of the elements and the structure.						liu, xiuping/0000-0002-7706-1843													2050-7488	2050-7496				MAR 8	2022	10	10					5442	5451		10.1039/d1ta07504g	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta07504g		JAN 2022											WOS:000755932200001

Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities are considered as biomarkers of pesticides poisoning. However, biomarkers of oxidative stress are also playing an important role in toxicity of these contaminants. Further, increased activities of gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, urea and creatinine have been linked with hepatic and nephrotoxic cell damage, respectively. The aim of this study was to ascertain if the indirect exposure to pesticides leads to some biochemical parameter changes. Thus, cholinesterase activities, oxidative stress status (lipid and protein oxidation), hepatic function (AST and ALT levels), hormonal function (TSH, T4, FSH, LH and AMH), renal function (serum creatinine and urea), as well as possible subclinical kidney damage (urinary proteins and biomarkers of early kidney damage) were evaluated in farmer women who collect fruits and vegetables comparing with a group of women non-occupational exposed to pesticides but living in the same rural environment. Samples were taken periodically along one year to relate the observed effects to a chronic exposure. Our main results showed for the first time a subclinical kidney damage in a rural setting with indirect chronic exposure to pesticides.

Nitrogen (N) fertilizers have been widely applied in rice cultivation fields to supply essential nutrients. However, the effects of N fertilizer addition on mercury (Hg) transformations are not unclear. This limits our understanding of MeHg formation in rice paddy ecosystems. In this study, we spiked three Hg tracers (200HgII, Me198Hg, and 202Hg0) in paddy slurries fertilized with urea, ammonium, and nitrate. The influences of N fertilization on Hg methylation, demethylation, and reduction and the underlying mechanisms were elucidated. The results revealed that dissimilatory nitrate reduction was the dominant process in the incubated paddy slurries. Nitrate addition inhibited HgII reduction, HgII methylation, and MeHg demethylation. Competition between nitrates and other electron acceptors (e.g., HgII, sulfate, or carbon dioxide) under dark conditions was the mechanism underlying nitrate-regulated Hg transformation. Ammonium and urea additions promoted HgII reduction, and anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled with HgII reduction (Hgammox) was likely the reason. This work highlighted that nitrate addition not only inhibited HgII methylation but also reduced the demethylation of MeHg and therefore may generate more accumulation of MeHg in the incubated paddy slurries. Findings from this study link the biogeochemical cycling of N and Hg and provide crucial knowledge for assessing Hg risks in intermittently flooded wetland ecosystems.

Elucidating Hepatic Lipidosis in Stray Cats through Serum Biochemistry, Liver Histopathology and Liver RNA Expression of PPAR-? and PPAR-?	SAINS MALAYSIANA												Early detection of feline hepatic lipidosis (FHL) with appropriate treatment can increase prognosis significantly. This study looks into the serum biochemistry and lipid composition of serum and liver samples in a group of stray cats (N=18) collected from pounds in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in blood serum was used to detect for liver damage possibly due to FHL, confirmed through light microscopy, serum biochemistry (triglyceride, cholesterol, creatinine, and urea), liver triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, and liver RNA expression of lipid droplet regulators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Differing severity of FHL in samples were divided and grouped using an adapted scoring method observing fatty change of liver (FCL) with trends between FCL groups investigated. Elevated serum ALT reflective of increasing FCL severity was observed with elevated concentrations of liver TAG and cholesterol levels. Serum TAG and cholesterol decreased with heightened FCL pointing to fatty acid oxidation and lipid restoration in the liver, supported by PPAR-gamma expression which also propose macrophage activation for liver recovery alongside PPAR-8 for lipogenesis and inflammatory reactions. Elevated serum creatinine and urea levels with increasing FCL severity propose overall intact hepatic function in the stray cat samples.

J	Wang, TJ				Wang, Tae Joong			Effect of Hydrothermal Aging over a Commercial DOC on NO2 Production and Subsequent SCR Efficiency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY												In this study, the effect of hydrothermal aging over a commercial diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) on deterioration in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) production activity has been experimentally investigated based on a micro-reactor DOC experiment. Through this experimental result, the NO2 to nitrogen oxides (NOx) ratio at DOC outlet has been mathematically expressed as a function of DOC temperature according to various aging conditions. The current study reveals that the catalyst aging temperature is a more dominant factor than the aging duration in terms of the decrease in NO2 production performance through DOC. The DOC sample hydrothermally aged for 25 h at 750 degrees C has displayed the lowest NO2 to NOx ratio compared to the samples aged for 25 similar to 100 h at 650 degrees C. Also, in this study, the impact of hydrothermal aging of a DOC on the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) efficiency in a DOC + SCR' aftertreatment system was predicted by using transient SCR simulations. To validate the SCR simulation, this study has conducted a dynamometer test of a non-road heavy-duty diesel engine with employing a commercial DOC + SCR' system on the exhaust line. The current study has quantitatively estimated the effect of the variation in NO2 to NOx ratio due to the hydrothermal aging of DOC on the NOx removal efficiency of SCR.																			1229-9138	1976-3832				DEC	2018	19	6					941	947		10.1007/s12239-018-0091-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12239-018-0091-3													WOS:000453025300001

Heterocyclization of Polyfunctionalized Pyrimidine: Synthesis and Antiproliferative Evaluation of Novel Azino- and Azolopyrimidines	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY												2-Amino-6-sulfanylidene-5,6-dihydropyrimidin-4(3H)-one (1) was subjected to reaction with urea and aromatic aldehydes in acidic medium to yield pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidines 5a and 5b through intermediate formation of 5-arylmethylidene derivative 3, followed by 1,4-addition and cyclization with elimination of hydrogen sulfide. The use of thiourea or guanidine instead of urea in the aforementioned process afforded pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidines 5c-5f. The condensation of 1 with thiourea gave [1,2,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyrimi-dine derivative 6. The reaction of 1 with benzaldehyde, followed by air oxidation, produced benzothiopyrano-pyrimidine 8, and condensation of the latter with urea or thiourea yielded [1,2,4]oxa(thia)diazolo[2,3-a]thio-chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidinles. Bis-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrimidines 12a and 12b were synthesized by the cyclocondensation of 1 with malonic and succinic acid dihydrazides. The newly synthesized fused pyrimidine derivatives were tested for their in vitro antiproliferative activity against two cell lines: human gastric carcinoma (BGC-823) and human lung cancer (A-549) in comparison to the NIH/3T3 murine fibroblast cell line. Some of these compounds, in particular 5a-5f, 6, 8, 10a, 10b, 12a, and 12b, proved to be the most effective against all cancer cell lines, with no impact on normal cells. Using the structure-activity relationships as a guide, the greater activity of compound 10b against A-549 cells (IC50 = 14.15 & PLUSMN;0.33 g/mL) was attributed to the presence of iminothiadiazolidine and thiopyran moieties.

Fasting triggers a complex array of adaptive metabolic responses, a process in which the liver plays a central role. Here, a high-throughput proteomic analysis was carried out on liver samples obtained from adult A. davidianus after 3, 7, and 11 months of fasting. As a result, the expression levels of 364 proteins were significantly changed in the fasted liver. Functional analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of key proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, amino acid oxidation, urea cycle, and antioxidant systems were increased in the fasted liver, especially at 7 and 11 months after fasting. In contrast, the expression levels of vital proteins involved in pentose phosphate pathway and protein synthesis were decreased after fasting. We also found that fasting not only activated fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis-related transcription factors PPARA and PPARGC1A, but also activated gluconeogenesis-related transcription factors FOXO1, HNF4A, and KLF15. This study confirms the central role of lipid and acetyl-CoA metabolism in A. davidianus liver in response to fasting at the protein level and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic response of A. davidianus liver to fasting.																			1664-042X					MAR 18	2020	11								208	10.3389/fphys.2020.00208	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00208								32256382					WOS:000525531900001

The NiFe foam serves as both the metal source and substrate, and the obtained nanosheets are firmly anchored on the foam. The obtained ultrathin nanosheet arrays could greatly increase the electrocatalytic active sites. This factor together with the synergistic effect between Fe and Ni simultaneously leads to an enhanced catalytic effect for water splitting and urea oxidation. This strategy could be scaled up to pave a viable way for low-cost fabrication of highly efficient electrodes for electrocatalysis.

In the presence of H2O2, Co2+ ions underwent oxidation to produce Co3+ ions and hydroxyl radicals, which then reacted with the fluorescence reagent, AUR, forming a fluorescence product at a pH of 9.0. If UA was present, it underwent oxidation to form urea, parabanic acid, and allantoin. This inhibited the Co2+ ions-catalyzed oxidation of AUR and resulted in a substantial decreasing in fluorescence intensity that was dependent on UA concentration. The buffer systems, pH values, and the concentrations of Co2+ ions, AUR, and H2O2 were crucial parameters in determining the sensitivity and selectivity of the method for sensing UA. Under optimal conditions, the fluorescence intensity decreased linearly with UA concentration in the 0.05-1.0 mu mol L-1 range (R-2=0.94) with a detection limit of 20 nmol L-1 at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The analytical recoveries in urine and human serum samples were 90%-100.7% and 90%-95% respectively. This method is simpler and more cost effective than are other optical methods for the detection of UA in biological samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, comprehensive assessments of how EENF affects CH4 and CO2 emissions from paddies and drylands and the associated benefits are lacking. Here, we present the results of a global meta analysis conducted to assess the above issues. Our results showed that, on average, applying nitrification inhibitors and coated controlled-release urea to paddy fields significantly decreased CH4 emissions by 24.0 % and 25.3 %, respectively, likely due to the weakened inhibition of NH4+ on CH4 oxidation. A similar effect on CO2 emission was observed when farmers used nitrification inhibitors and coated controlled-release urea in the drylands. The meta-analysis results revealed that all EENF products could help mitigate the global warming potential of paddies and drylands. After incorporating the benefit of global warming potential mitigation into the cost-benefit analysis, coated controlled-release urea application in paddies and drylands produced the largest environmental gains of $ 76.34 ha(-1) and $ 79.35 ha(-1), respectively. However, the relatively lower purchasing cost and larger yield increase of urease inhibitors resulted in the largest net profits for farmers. Moreover, a greater economic return was generally achieved by applying EENF to paddy fields than by applying EENF to drylands. These findings highlight the role of EENF in mitigating the global warming potential of global paddy and dryland fields, which has facilitated the comprehensive recognition of EENF-induced impacts.

J	Psenicka, M				Psenicka, Martin			A novel method for rapid elimination of sturgeon egg stickiness using sodium hypochlorite	AQUACULTURE												Reducing egg stickiness is a crucial step in artificial culture of sturgeon eggs, with commonly used methods being time consuming or interfering with hatching. Sodium hypochlorite (SH) at varying concentrations and exposure times was tested on sterlet Acipenser ruthenus eggs, with 0.03% SH for 40 s effectively eliminating stickiness without impairment to eggs, embryo development, or hatching when compared with other de-adhesion methods (clay; NaCl, urea, and tannic acid). Field tests using sterlet, Siberian sturgeon Acipenser baerii, and Russian sturgeon Acipenser gueldenstaedtii showed similar numbers of larvae hatched using SH and clay. Immunohistochemistry revealed a protein carbonyl group only on the surface of eggs treated with SH, evidence of oxidation as the mode of action and indicating that oxidation did not affect inner egg layers or cytoplasm. Treatment with SH is a rapid, simple, and inexpensive method for de-adhesion of sturgeon eggs. Statement of relevance: Sturgeons represent a valuable group of fish in aquaculture, especially for caviar, but also for meat production. This study describes a novel approach to sturgeon egg de-adhesion involving oxidation of egg surface. The method requires little time, is low cost, and disinfects and softens the egg surface, which facilitates hatching. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reasonably design of the catalytic configuration can flexibly adjust the electronic structure and thus enhancing their intrinsic activity.

In the oligotrophic gyres, nitrite accumulates near the base of the euphotic zone, demonstrating a subsurface maximum, termed the primary nitrite maximum; while in subpolar regions, nitrite concentrations are elevated in the near-surface ocean. As yet, the mechanisms controlling this meridional pattern remain unclear. Here, we present vertically resolved profiles of rates of nitrite production and consumption extending from the Subtropical Gyre to the Subarctic Front in the North Pacific Ocean. Our results indicate that the latitudinal distributions of nitrite across this basin are influenced by variations in phytoplankton-nitrifier interactions. In the well-lit oligotrophic surface, phytoplankton dominates rapid nitrite cycling via coupled release and re-assimilation; below the euphotic zone, diminished light stress on nitrite oxidizers results in rapid turnover and limits nitrite. By contrast, in subpolar regions where nitrate concentrations are elevated in the euphotic zone, nitrite is released during assimilative nitrate reduction and competition between phytoplankton and nitrifiers for ammonium is relaxed, facilitating ammonia oxidation. These processes, together with differential light sensitivities of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers, allow net accumulation of nitrite. Furthermore, we demonstrate a substantial contribution of urea oxidation in forming the primary nitrite maximum and balancing the two steps of marine nitrification. Our findings reveal physical-biological interactive controls on nitrite cycling and distributions in the ocean and help disentangle the complex effect of phytoplankton-microbe interactions on marine nitrogen biogeochemistry.					邹, 文斌/HWQ-8314-2023; Li, Xiaolin/E-5320-2013; Hutchins, David/D-3301-2013; Dai, Minhan/G-3343-2010; Kao, Shuh-Ji/F-8418-2015	Hutchins, David/0000-0002-6637-756X; Church, Matthew/0000-0002-6166-8579; Ward, Bess/0000-0001-7870-2684; Wan, Xianhui/0000-0002-4870-7369; Li, Xiaolin/0000-0001-9314-5716; Dai, Minhan/0000-0003-0550-0701; Kao, Shuh-Ji/0000-0002-5054-9099													0886-6236	1944-9224				NOV	2021	35	11							e2021GB007072	10.1029/2021GB007072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021GB007072													WOS:000723020500002

Remarkable enhancement of the selective catalytic reduction of NO at low temperature by collaborative effect of ethanol and NH3 over silver supported catalyst	APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL												The NOx selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is extensively studied as an effective process for air pollutants abatement from lean burn and Diesel vehicles. In the implemented Urea-SCR technology, the NO2/NOx ratio is a key parameter that limits the deNO(x) efficiency at low temperature (175-250 degrees C). We demonstrate that co-feeding of ammonia and ethanol on a Ag/Al2O3 catalyst enables a drastic enhancement of the NOx conversion at temperatures below 200 degrees C using only NO as NOx (standard SCR condition). Even if NO2 is provided at low temperature by the NO oxidation over Ag/Al2O3 in presence of EtOH, the NO. conversion improvement is not only due to a direct reaction between NH3 and NOx, but mainly attributed to the availability of hydrogen H* species resulting from EtOH oxidation (similar to a H-2 assisted NH3-SCR process). Due to the presence of remaining NH3 and NO2 (formed over Ag/Al2O3 catalyst), further deNO(x) efficiency improvement was obtained at low temperature by addition of a NH3-SCR catalyst (WO3/CeZr). The critical dependence of the SCR process on the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) efficiency at low temperature is thus avoided. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Photocatalysis can be implemented as a refining step in treatment trains to mineralize these pharmaceuticals. In this study, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) was integrated into boron-doped graphitic-carbon nitride (BCN) to produce visible-light-active vanadium oxide/boron co-doped graphitic-carbon nitride (V2O5-BCN) photocatalysts wherein graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was produced by thermal poly-condensation of urea. The photocatalysts were characterized and their performance under visible light irradiation was evaluated using diclofenac (DCF) as a representative pharmaceutical active compound. The effects of dopant amount, photocatalyst dosage, initial DCF concentration, solution pH and presence of anions on DCF removal were examined. Results showed that DCF adsorption on V2O5-BCN photocatalysts conformed to the pseudo-second order kinetic model while DCF photodegradation followed the pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. The photocatalysts were found to be stable and reusable. DCF removals reached 100% in < 105 min under visible light irradiation. Overall, the as-synthesized V2O5-BCN heterojunction proved to be a promising photocatalyst for sustainable and low-cost treatment of pharmaceutical-contaminated wastewaters.

However, the reaction mechanisms and electrochemical performances and are still needed to be further investigated. Herein, the development of electrochemical NO reduction and oxidation reaction (NORR and NOOR) were respectively summarized. In the NORR part, we summarized the electrocatalytic reaction systems, including directly NORR (NO to NH3/NH2OH) and the C-N coupling reactions with COx for urea, and organic molecules for amino acid, oxime. The reaction mechanisms and design principles of electrocatalysts for different reaction systems were reviewed, combining theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques. The NO reaction is also a potential approach to replace others cathodic reduction. Finally, the challenges and outlooks in this fields have been proposed. The electrocatalytic NO reaction not only realizes the efficient green utilization, but also provides guidance for nitrogen economy.

This is the case of ammonia, which is injected into the exhaust gas through urea injections for NOx abatement in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems and can also be generated in three-way catalysts. However, ammonia slip requires its oxidation on a dedicated ammonia slip catalyst (ASC). The set composed of the urea injection system, SCR, and ASC requires control tools to ensure high NOx conversion efficiency and compliant ammonia slip under real driving conditions. These tasks are based on the use of NOx sensors ZrO2 pumping cell-based, which has the disadvantage of high cross-sensitivity to ammonia that can affect the measurement of NOx and compromise the SCR-ASC control strategies. The present work proposes a methodology to predict ammonia and NOx tailpipe emissions. For this purpose, a control-oriented ASC model was developed to use its ammonia slip prediction to determine the cross-sensitivity correction of the tailpipe NOx sensor. The model is based on a simplified solution of the transport equations of the species involved in the ASC reaction mechanism. The model was calibrated using steady- and quasi-steady-state tests performed in a Euro 6c engine. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology to predict NOx and ammonia emissions was evaluated against experimental data corresponding to worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycles (WLTC) applying different urea dosing strategies.

The effect of postheating temperature on the structure, microstructure, and chromatic properties of the synthesized powders was also studied. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the as-synthesized powders were amorphous to crystalline FeCr2O4 phases, depending on fuel type. Moreover, regardless of the fuel type, postheating led to the d-space shift and oxidation and formation of (Fe,Cr)(2)O-3 solid solution. Phase transformation of FeCr2O4 to (Fe,Cr)(2)O-3 solid solution was observed at 500/750 degrees C depending on the dominant phase present in the as-synthesized particles. Fourier transform infrared analysis illustrated a shift in the band position of octahedral M-O and tetrahedral M-O bonds due to the movement of Fe cations and the lattice shrinkage by increasing the postheating temperature. Moreover, scanning electron micrographs showed that Fe0.7Cr1.3O3 semispherical fine particles consisted mainly of porous and spongy FeCr2O4 particles due to the oxidation and phase transformation during postheating. According to chromatic measurements, the ink prepared by using the powders synthesized in the presence of glycine and post-heated at 500 degrees C showed reddish-brown color which could be considered a promising candidate for tile decoration application. Furthermore, rheology studies revealed that the prepared ink showed non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior.

Much less attention has been paid, however, to the production of CeFeO3, as well as to the study of its physicochemical and catalytic properties, in particular, in the promising process of CO2 utilization by hydrogenation to CO and hydrocarbons. This study presents the results of a study on the synthesis of CeFeO3 by solution combustion synthesis (SCS) using various fuels, fuel-to-oxidizer ratios, and additives. The SCS products were characterized by XRD, FTIR, N-2-physisorption, SEM, DTA-TGA, and H-2-TPR. It has been established that glycine provides the best yield of CeFeO3, while the addition of NH4NO3 promotes an increase in the amount of CeFeO3 by 7-12 wt%. In addition, the synthesis of CeFeO3 with the participation of NH4NO3 makes it possible to surpass the activity of the CeO2-Fe2O3 system at low temperatures (300-400 degrees C), as well as to increase selectivity to hydrocarbons. The observed effects are due to the increased gas evolution and ejection of reactive FeOx nanoparticles on the surface of crystallites, and an increase in the surface defects. CeFeO3 obtained in this study allows for achieving higher CO2 conversion compared to LaFeO3 at 600 degrees C.

Many reactive carbonyl intermediates and end products originating from the oxidative stress pathways are recognised as uraemic toxins and may play a role in CKD progression. The aim of the present study is to confirm whether carbonyl end-product formation is higher in cats affected by CKD and to assess whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) might affect these hallmarks. Methods Twenty-two cats were divided into three groups: a control group (CG), cats with CKD and cats with CKD treated with an ACEi. Serum levels of pentosidine, carboxymethyllysine, advanced oxidation protein products, malondialdehyde, methylglyoxal and hexanoyl-lysine were measured. In addition, biochemical parameters and systolic blood pressure were evaluated. After checking for normality, comparisons between groups were performed followed by multiple comparison tests. P values <= 0.05 were considered significant. Correlations between concentrations of the considered biomarkers and of the other metabolic parameters were investigated. Results Advanced oxidation protein products, malondialdehyde and hexanoyl-lysine concentrations were significantly higher in CKD and ACEi-treated groups compared with the CG (P <0.05). Carboxymethyllysine increased in the ACEi-treated group when compared with the CG, whereas intermediate values of these biomarkers were found in the CKD group (P <0.05). The ACEi-treated group showed the highest values of carboxymethyllysine, advanced oxidation protein products and hexanoyl-lysine. By contrast, the CKD group had the highest concentration of malondialdehyde. No statistically significant difference was found in the levels of pentosidine or methylglyoxal. End products correlated with creatinine and urea and with each other. Conclusions and relevance Significantly high concentrations of both intermediate and end products of carbonyl/oxidative stress were detected in CKD cats. This is the first study to have concurrently taken into account several uraemic toxins and biochemical parameters in cats affected by CKD.

The obtained catalyst (Fe3O4.GO.Im@MnPor) was characterized through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and diffuse reflectance UV-Visible spectrophotometry (DR UV-Vis), powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The characterization was performed to determine the amount of manganese porphyrin loaded on the GO support. The new immobilized catalyst was employed for the efficient epoxidation of different alkenes with urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) and acetic acid (HOAc) as oxidant activators under mild conditions. Olefins were oxidized efficiently to their corresponding epoxide with 63-100% selectivity in the presence of Fe3O4.GO.Im@MnPor. Moreover, an remarkable turnover frequency (93) was achieved for the oxidation of alpha-pinene. The graphene oxide-bound Mn-porphyrin was recovered from the reaction mixture by magnetic decantation and reused several times. [GRAPHICS] .

In order to reduce environmental pollution, utilization of digested slurry as a fertilizer in paddy fields is one promising measure. NH3 in the digested slurry is easily volatilized after application. Therefore, NH3 volatilization is a key factor for fertilizer design. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to examine the characteristics and mechanism of NH3 volatilization from Vietnamese paddy soil (acid sulfate soil) following application of digested slurry with the overall goal of evaluating digested slurry as a fertilizer. Incubation experiments under flooded conditions were conducted with Vietnamese acid sulfate soil and Japanese soil. Six fertilizer treatments were carried out, namely Vietnamese soil with no fertilizer, Vietnamese soil with urea, Vietnamese soil with digested slurry, Vietnamese soil with half the amount of digested slurry, Japanese soil with no fertilizer, and Japanese soil with digested slurry. pH, NHx-N, and SO4 (2-) in the floodwater and NH3 volatilization fluxes were measured for 1 week after application of digested slurry or urea. The results indicated that the amount of NH3 volatilization in Vietnamese soil is small compared to Japanese soil because the pH of floodwater from Vietnamese soil remains low (3.7-7.6) due to oxidation of pyrite, and this low pH inhibits NH3 volatilization. Therefore, we conclude that NHX-N in digested slurry can be efficiently utilized as a fertilizer in Vietnamese paddy fields with acid sulfate soils. Moreover, the results also indicate that relatively more NH3 is volatilized even in Vietnamese soil by the slowdown in pyrite oxidation and the buffering capacity of digested slurry when much digested slurry is applied. Therefore, NH3 volatilization can be reduced using methods such as a split application to maintain low floodwater pH.

The surface modification was performed in an aluminate-based electrolyte, having urea and hydrazine with inherent molecular structures, which might act as electron acceptor and donor during plasma assisted electrochemical reaction. The presence of hydrazine working as donor would promote the formation of magnesium aluminates in the-oxide layer, resulting in superior compactness of the oxide:layer to that when urea was used as the working as acceptor since the precipitation of MgCO3 was favored in the electrolyte with urea. The thickness of the oxide layer formed by a combination of urea and hydrazine was higher than urea, while the porosity was higher than hydrazine. The electrochemical performance was enhanced in the order of hydrazine, urea and hydrazine combined, and urea, which was discussed on the basis of impedance interpretation.					, Muhammad Prisla/AFK-0275-2022	Kamil, Muhammad Prisla/0000-0002-6121-7655													1944-8244	1944-8252				AUG 30	2017	9	34					28967	28979		10.1021/acsami.7b05773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b05773								28771306					WOS:000409395500091

Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: control (C), control treated with CFE (C + CFE), high-fat diet fed (HFD), high-fat diet fed treated with CFE (HFD + CFE), and high-fat diet fed treated with metformin (HFD + metformin). CFE was orally administered (200 mg/kg body weight) to Groups C + CFE and HFD + CFE rats for 90 days. Renal functional markers such as, urea, uric acid, and creatinine levels in plasma were quantified during the experimental period. At the end of the experimental period, activities of transaminases and oxidative stress markers, i.e., reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and activities of antioxidant enzymes were assayed in renal tissue. Coadministration of CFE along with HF-diet in Group HFD + CFE prevented the rise in the levels of plasma urea, uric acid, and creatinine, and elevated activities of renal transaminases with decreased protein content of Group HFD (p < 0.05). Establishment of oxidative stress in Group HFD, as evident from elevated lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation levels with depleted levels of GSH, and decreased activities of GSH dependent and independent antioxidant enzymes, was prevented in Groups HFD + CFE and HFD + metformin rats. Further, there were no deviations in the studied parameters but there was improved antioxidant status of Group C + CFE from Group C which revealed the nontoxic nature of CFE even under chronic treatment. Thus, CFE treatment effectively alleviated the HF-diet induced renal damage. Hence, this plant could be used as an adjuvant therapy for the prevention and/or management of HF-diet induced renal damage. Copyright (C) 2016, Food and Drug Administration, Taiwan.

J	Hussain, M; Malik, RN; Taylor, A				Hussain, Majid; Malik, Riffat Naseem; Taylor, Adam			Environmental profile analysis of particleboard production: a study in a Pakistani technological condition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT												Particleboard is a composite panel comprising small pieces of wood bonded by adhesives. The particleboard industry is growing in Pakistan, but there is little information on the environmental impacts associated with this product. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a life cycle assessment of particleboard manufactured in Pakistan and to provide suggestions to improve its environmental profile. The study covers energy use and associated environmental impacts of raw materials and processes during particleboard manufacture in the year 2015-2016. The study uses a cradle-to-gate (distribution center) life cycle assessment approach. The reference unit for this study was 1.0 m(3) of finished, uncoated particleboard. Primary data from the particleboard mill surveys were combined with secondary database information and modeled using CML 2000 v.2.05 methodology and a cumulative exergy demand indicator present in the SimaPro v.8.3 software. The results reveal that urea formaldehyde resin, transportation of raw materials, and finished product distribution had the highest contribution to all the environmental impact categories evaluated. Heavy fuel oil and natural gas consumption was responsible for abiotic depletion, photochemical oxidation, ozone layer depletion, and marine aquatic ecotoxicity impacts. The rotary dryer and hot press were the most important sectors in terms of emissions from the manufacturing process. The total cumulative exergy demand required for manufacturing of 1.0 m(3) particleboard was 15,632 MJ-eq, with most of the energy usage associated with non-renewable, fossil fuel sources. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for a reduction in the quantity of urea formaldehyde resin consumed and freight transport distances. The results indicated that reducing the urea formaldehyde resin use and freight distances could greatly decrease environmental impacts. Most of the surveyed mills did not have emissions control systems, and most of the mills exceed the limits set by the National Environmental Quality Standards of Pakistan. Environmental impact improvements might be attained by reducing quantity of urea formaldehyde resin and transportation freight distances and by installing pollution control devices.

All samples were characterized using XRD, FT-IR, Raman, BET, FESEM, and XPS. The specific surface area of the samples ranged from 110 to 344 m(2)/g, with the highest value observed for NrGA48. Raman spectroscopy showed the generation of disorder in the structure with the insertion of nitrogen atoms. The electrochemical performance of the sample has been investigated through linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and RDE. The NrGA32 sample exhibited superior electrochemical performance compared to the other samples, and was therefore chosen as the optimized N-doped sample to investigate the effect of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) as a redox mediator. The addition of CoPC significantly improved the electrochemical properties of NrGA32, increasing the electron transfer number from 3.5 to 3.85, enhancing the oxygen reduction current, and shifting the onset potential from 0.480 to 0.700 V vs. SHE.																			0021-891X	1572-8838				NOV	2023	53	11					2197	2212		10.1007/s10800-023-01918-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10800-023-01918-8		JUN 2023											WOS:001000347000002

The concentration of these amino acids in urine or blood is indicative of proper urea degradation. An inappropriate degradation has great implications in various metabolic disorders. In particular, the concentration of L-arginine and L-citrulline builds up in blood when Argininemia or Citrullinemia disorders are diagnosed. Hence, their fast and reproducible determination plays a key role in metabolic studies and suitable analytical methods are necessary for their quantitative analysis in biological samples. In this study, a simple analytical approach for the determination of L-arginine, L-ornithine and L-citrulline in urine and serum by anion-exchange chromatography, without derivatization schemes is described. A carbon screen-printed electrode containing single wall carbon nanotubes modified with highly-dense electrogenerated Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles is used as liquid chromatography electrochemical detector. At a first step, micro structures of a novel paddle-wheel tetrakis-acetate di-nickel(II) complex [Ni-2(CH3COO)(4)] were electrosynthetized on a gold coil from its precursor tetrakis-monothioacetate di-nickel paddle-wheel complex [Ni-2(CH3COS)(4) EtOH]. These microstructures serve the pattern to produce highly dense and uniform coverage of small size Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles (3 nm) on the electrode surface by a simple procedure consisting of successive cyclic potential scans in alkaline medium. The resulting modified electrode presents a potent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of L-arginine, l-ornithine and l-citrulline allowing, coupled to a chromatographic system, quantify these amino acids directly in biological samples.

Richard; Madugundu, Guru S.; Cadet, Jean			Ozone-Induced DNA Damage: A Pandora's Box of Oxidatively Modified DNA Bases	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY												Ozone is a major component of air pollution and carries potentially mutagenic and harmful affects to health. The oxidation of isolated calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) led to the nearly quantitative loss of normal DNA 2'-deoxyribonucleosides in the following order: T > G > C >> A. The major modification of pyrimidines (T, C, and 5-methylcytosine (5mC)) was the corresponding 5-hydroxyhydantoin derivative after complete digestion of DNA to its component 2'-deoxyribonucleosides. The oxidation of 5mC was 2.5-fold more susceptible than C considering the relative mole fraction of 5mC to C in CT-DNA. Other common oxidation products of pyrimidines (e.g., 5,6dihydroxy-5,6-dihydropyrimidines, the so-called pyrimidine 5,6glycols) were formed with a lower yield than 5-hydroxyhydantoin derivatives. In addition, several common oxidation products of G were observed (e.g., 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8oxoG)) albeit with relatively minor yields. The sum of individual products was notably less than the loss of 2'-deoxyribonucleosides from which they were derived. In a search for additional products, we discovered the formation of pyrimidine ring fragments, predominantly N-formamide and N-urea, which were measured as a dinucleotide next to a nonmodified nucleotide upon partial digestion of oxidized DNA. Interestingly, the latter fragments were also observed in dinucleotides containing 8oxoG, indicating the formation of tandem lesions during ozonolysis of DNA. The oxidation of DNA upon exposure to ozone can be explained by reactions of an intermediate ozonide. These studies underline the complexity of ozone-induced DNA damage and provide valuable information to assess the formation of this damage in cellular DNA.

We sought to assess whether hydration biomarkers [24-h urine volume (UVol) and urine urea nitrogen concentration (UUN)] and copeptin (a surrogate for AVP) are associated with 24-h EE, respiratory quotient (RQ), and daily energy intake (DEI). Subjects/Methods In a secondary analysis of collected data, we selected healthy adults (Group 1, n = 177) who had 24-h whole-room indirect calorimetry measurements in energy balance with 24-h urine collection and fasting copeptin measurements (n = 117), followed by 3 days ad libitum food intake. A separate group (Group 2, n = 284) with hydration markers and calorimetry measurements was also studied. The main outcome measures were 24-h RQ, 24-h EE, DEI, substrate oxidation. Results In Group 1, lower 24-h UVol and higher 24-h UUN, indicating lower hydration, were correlated with lower 24-h RQ (r = 0.35, p < 0.0001, and r = -0.29, p = 0.0001, respectively; results similar in Group 2) and predicted subsequent reduced DEI (r = 0.20, p = 0.01, and r = -0.27, p = 0.0003, respectively), adjusted for confounders. Copeptin was independently associated with 24-h lipid oxidation (r = -0.23, p = 0.01). In Group 2, lower hydration was associated with reduced 24-h EE (24-h UVol: r = 0.29, p < 0.0001; 24-h UUN: r = -0.25, p < 0.0001). Conclusions Hydration biomarkers were associated with metabolic differences characterized by altered food intake, fuel selection, and possibly EE. Independently, copeptin was associated with higher lipid oxidation.

In this work, NOx removal efficiency was nearly retained in the presence of potassium over FeOx-WO3 (FW) catalysts via protecting iron active species using different template agents. Typically, FW using urea (FW-(urea)) as template agent showed superior de-NOx performance after being poisoned by potassium (K/FW-(urea)). Urea could promote the facile binding of potassium with WO3, which acted as alkali-poisoning sites so that iron active species were reserved to a great extent. Additionally, potassium species tended to be aggregated over K/FW-(urea) and thus a lot of iron active sites could be exposed. Besides, K/FW-(urea) catalyst has higher surface acidity, superior redox ability, stronger interaction of WO3 with Fe2O3, and more surface adsorbed oxygen compare with other parallel poisoned samples. This is the reason for the remarkable ability of potassium resistance over K/FW-(urea). The strategy of template regulation could offer a novel route for maintaining considerable NH3-SCR performance in the presence of alkali.					wang, hao/JKH-5890-2023; Chen, Jianjun/E-8912-2011	Liu, Haibo/0000-0002-4213-2883													1383-5866	1873-3794				NOV 1	2022	300								121824	10.1016/j.seppur.2022.121824	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2022.121824		AUG 2022											WOS:000843375400001
J	Zhang, Y; Reed, A; Kim, DY				Zhang, Yan; Reed, Allen; Kim, Doo Young			Nitrogen doped carbon nano-onions as efficient and robust electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions	CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS												We investigated synthesis and electrocatalytic performance of metal-free, nitrogen-doped carbon nanoonions (N-CNOs) for oxygen reduction reactions in alkaline electrolyte. N-CNOs were prepared by chemical oxidation of nanodiamond-derived carbon nano-onions (ox-CNOs), followed by thermal annealing with urea under the flow of argon gas. The chemical oxidation step was critical to successfully internalize nitrogen atoms into carbon network. Morphology, microstructure, and chemical states of carbon nano-onions (CNOs), ox-CNOs, and N-CNOs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrocatalytic activity of pristine and modified CNOs was characterized by a series of electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical characterizations were done with thin film electrodes of CNOs mounted on a glassy carbon disk. Compared to CNOs and ox-CNOs, N-CNOs showed remarkably enhanced electron-transfer kinetics with the 4-electron transfer as a dominant reaction pathway. Overall, N-CNOs exhibited electrochemical characteristics comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The electromagnetic wave (EMW) parameters of NGNRs can be effectively regulated by controlling the oxidation of GONRs and the content of N atoms doping, which are favorable for impedance match and absorption. Benefiting from the controllable oxidation of GONRs, the NGNRs have hierarchical structure of 1D nanotubes and 2D nanoribbons, which can enhance the interaction between the NGNRs and EMW. At the thickness of 3 mm, 7NGNRs obtains a minimum reflection loss value of - 45 dB at 9 GHz, with an effective absorption bandwidth up to 3.2 GHz (from 7.5 to 10.7 GHz). The suitable microwave absorption performance of NGNRs is attributed to the abundant interfaces, N atoms and residual defects in NGNRs, which can not only benefit considerable impedance match but also act as polarization centers. This research provides an effective strategy to tune the EMW absorption performance of carbon-based materials for lightweight, wide-bandwidth absorbers with superior absorption properties.

We synthesized N-doped polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-derived carbon materials with surface areas of up to 2190.9 m2/g and nitrogen/oxygen vacancies via urea-assisted pyrolysis. These materials exhibited exceptional adsorption and catalytic activities in a Fenton-like reaction for tetracycline degradation. The N-doped PET-derived catalyst (NPETK-800) achieved a 95 % removal efficiency for tetracycline at 50 mg/L, attributed to synergistic adsorption and oxidation effects via sodium percarbonate activation. NPETK-800 underwent surface hydroxylation through the electrostatic adsorption of OH- from CO32hydrolysis on N and O vacancies, and its hydroxylated surface converted the adsorption mode of H2O2 to a Hbonded structure. This mode favored cleaving the O-H bond over the O-O bond in H2O2, generating 1O2 and O2 center dot- , crucial for tetracycline degradation. This study unveils the pivotal role of vacancies in tuning the generation of reactive oxygen species in Fenton-like reactions.

However, conventional urea oxidation reaction is subject to complex six-electron transfer kinetics and requires alkaline conditions. Herein, an efficient method of enhancing center dot Cl generation by introducing electrophilic Cu(II) into Co3O4 nanowires anode was proposed, which realized the highly efficient TN removal and H2 production in urine treatment under neutral conditions. The key mechanism is that the electrophilic effect of Cu(II) attracts electrons from the oxygen atom, which causes the oxygen atom to further attract electrons from Co(II), reducing the charge density of Co(II). Electrophilic Cu(II) accelerates the difficult conversion step of Co(II) to Co(III), which enhances the generation of center dot Cl. The generated center dot Cl efficiently converts urea to N2, while the electron transport promotes H2 production on the CuO@CF nanowires cathode. Results showed that the steady-state concentration of center dot Cl was increased to about 1.5 times by the Cu(II) introduction. TN removal and H2 production reached 94.7% and 642.1 mu mol after 50 min, which was 1.6 times and 1.5 times that of Co3O4 system, respectively. It was also 2.3 times and 2.1 times of RuO2, and 3.3 times and 2.5 times of Pt, respectively. Moreover, TN removal was 11.0 times higher than that of without center dot Cl mediation, and H2 production was 4.3 times higher. More importantly, excellent TN removal and H2 production were also observed in the actual urine treatment. This work provides a practical possibility for efficient total nitrogen removal and hydrogen recovery in urine wastewater treatment.

Hepatic metabolism of anaesthetized growing pigs during acute portal infusion of volatile fatty acids and hydroxy-methyl butyrate	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												The objective of the experiment was to study hepatic metabolism during infusion of volatile fatty acids (VFA) differing in amounts and composition or infusion of HMB. Three fasted (20 h) pigs (mean BW +/- SE; 58 kg +/- 1) were fitted with indwelling catheters in the portal vein, hepatic vein, mesenteric artery and two in mesenteric veins. One of the mesenteric vein catheters was used to infuse VFA in the anesthetized pigs to mimic effects of increased consumption of dietary fibers. Sixteen sets of blood samples were simultaneously drawn from the artery and portal and hepatic veins at 15 min intervals and analyzed for contents of para-amino-hippuric acid (PAH; blood flow marker) and plasma metabolites. Total VFA was infused at a rate of 0 mmol/h (background; Inf1, Inf6), 60 mmol/h (Inf2) or 120 mmol/h (Inf3 to Inf5). Infused VFA contained 70, 20, and 5% of acetate, propionate, and butyrate, respectively, for Inf2 and Inf3, or 65%, 20%, and 10% of acetate, propionate, and butyrate, respectively, for Inf4 and Inf5. In addition, for Inf5, HMB was infused at 2 mmol/h. Statistical analysis included fixed effects of infusion and interaction between infusion and samplings within infusion while accounting for repeated measurements. A net hepatic uptake of propionate, butyrate, and lactate was observed, whereas the liver released acetate, glucose, and urea. The portal lactate absorption could not account for the net hepatic uptake of lactate, suggesting lactate originated from partial oxidation of glycogen in peripheral muscle tissues. The net hepatic lactate uptake could account for 29% to 84% of the hepatic glucose released during VFA infusions. Net portal recovery rates of infused VFA were between 90% and 105%, indicating that PAH is a reliable blood flow marker. In conclusion, lactate and AA from peripheral tissues were likely the two most important glycogenic precursors for gluconeogenesis in the liver during fasting.																			0021-8812	1525-3163				SEP	2016	94			3			324	327		10.2527/jas.2015-9780	http://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2015-9780													WOS:000385006900075

Extensive clinical data suggests that the prevalence of hyperlipidemia in CKD patients is significantly higher than in the general population. Lipid metabolism disorders can damage the renal parenchyma and promote the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cyanate is a uremic toxin that has attracted widespread attention in recent years. Usually, 0.8% of the molar concentration of urea is converted into cyanate, while myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate to produce cyanate at the site of inflammation during smoking, inflammation, or exposure to environmental pollution. One of the important physiological functions of cyanate is protein carbonylation, a non-enzymatic post-translational protein modification. Carbamylation reactions on proteins are capable of irreversibly changing protein structure and function, resulting in pathologic molecular and cellular responses. In addition, recent studies have shown that cyanate can directly damage vascular tissue by producing large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress leads to the disorder of liver lipid metabolism, which is also an important mechanism leading to cirrhosis and liver fibrosis. However, the influence of cyanate on liver has remained unclear. In this research, we explored the effects of cyanate on the oxidative stress injury and abnormal lipid metabolism in mice and HL-7702 cells. In results, cyanate induced hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress by influencing the content of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) in liver. Cyanate inhibited NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and the phosphorylation of adenosine 5 ' monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), activated the mTOR pathway. Oxidative stress on the cells reduced significantly by treating with TBHQ, an antioxidant, which is also an activator of Nrf2. The activity of Nrf2 was rehabilitated and phosphorylation of mTOR decreased. In conclusion, cyanate could induce oxidative stress damage and lipid deposition by inhibiting Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which was rescued by inhibitor of Nrf2.					li, jing/HHC-2446-2022; hu, ling/GWC-1104-2022	Ran, Jianhua/0000-0001-9676-570X														1420-3049				SEP	2019	24	18							3231	10.3390/molecules24183231	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules24183231								31491954					WOS:000488830500023
J	Lubis, MAR; Park, BD; Hong, MK				Lubis, Muhammad Adly Rahandi; Park, Byung-Dae; Hong, Min-Kug			Tuning of Adhesion and Disintegration of Oxidized Starch Adhesives for the Recycling of Medium Density Fiberboard	BIORESOURCES												Oxidized starch (OS) adhesives with a balance between their adhesion and disintegration properties were prepared by controlling the degree of oxidation and modifying the cross-linker type and level to replace urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins for easy recycling of medium density fiberboard (MDF). Four molar ratios of H2O2/starch, two types of cross-linker, i.e., blocked-pMDI (B-pMDI) and citric acid (CA), and three levels of the cross-linkers were employed to tailor the performance of the OS adhesives. The OS reacted with the isocyanate groups from the B-pMDI to form amide linkages, while it formed ester linkages by reacting with the CA. The resulting B-pMDI/OS-bonded MDF had better physical and mechanical properties than the CA/OS-bonded MDF, with comparable adhesion (0.34 MPa) to UF resins and ten times greater degree of fiber disintegration than UF resins. The combination of a 0.5 molar ratio OS with 7.5 wt% of B-pMDI produced MDF exhibiting an optimal balance between adhesion and disintegration, suggesting that such OS adhesives could someday replace UF resins in manufacturing and recycling of MDF without formaldehyde emission.

Key reaction was the Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of a piperidine-based beta-oxoester, which proceeded in very good yield with high level of enantioselectivity (90 %, 95 % ee). The a-allyl moiety was transformed into a 1,4-diketone by Pd-catalyzed Wacker oxidation with molecular oxygen (89 %). This intermediate was cyclized in an intramolecular aldol reaction furnishing the cyclopentenone motif (86 %). Hydrogenation of the C-C double bond gave the cisannulated octahydrocyclopenta[c]pyridine (86 %), which was submitted to Fischer indolization (85 %). Although two regioisomers could be expected, only the angular constitution was observed. Relative and absolute configurations were established by X-ray crystallography of a para-iodo benzamide derivative. The utility of the title compound as scaffold is further highlighted by a number of synthetically useful transformations, for instance formation of carboxamides, sulfonamides, ureas and reductive aminations with aldehydes.																			1434-193X	1099-0690				NOV 1	2018	2018	40					5524	5531		10.1002/ejoc.201801102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejoc.201801102													WOS:000449078700007

This type of modification was carried-out using two different types of organic acids, citric acid (CA) and oxalic acid (OA). The modification of the MWCNTs was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), where functional groups such as OH, C=O, O-C=O and COOH were detected. By means of Raman spectroscopy, an increase in carbon surface defects was found. On the other hand, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), oxidation was evidenced on the surface of the modified MWCNT. In both Raman spectroscopy and XPS, the results indicate a greater modification when CA is used, possibly due to the fact that CA has a larger number of functional groups. MWCNT-CA showed good dispersion in methanol, while MWCNT-OA showed good stability in methanol and ethanol. Finally, a 20% removal of creatinine efficiency improvement was found with respect to the unmodified MWCNTs, while no improvement was found in the case of urea and uric acid.

Structural, morphological and optical properties of sheet like WO3 nanostructure and its catalytic activities for photoelectrochemical water splitting	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS												Herein, sheet like WO3 nanostructures were synthesized by facile hydrothermal method in the presence and absence of urea. The phase formation and crystallinity of the synthesized samples were investigated by using powder X-ray diffraction technique, which revealed that the synthesized nanostructures in the presence of urea showed the high crystalline quality than the nanostructures synthesized in the absence of urea. Morphology and size of the synthesized nanostructures were identified from field-emission scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopy characterizations, which showed the sheet like morphology. The optical band gap was calculated as 2.57 and 3.03 eV for WO3 nanostructures synthesized in the presence and absence of urea respectively. Moreover, the photocurrent density was measured to study the photoelectrochemical water splitting performance of the synthesized nanostructures. The photocurrent density of 0.800 mA cm(-1) at 1.2 V s. Ag/AgCl and 0.011 mA cm(-1) at 1.2 V s. Ag/AgCl for WO3 nanostructures synthesized in the presence and absence of urea respectively. The higher photocurrent density of the WO3 nanostructures synthesized in the presence of urea was due to the improved charge transport property.

Therefore, an incubation experiment was conducted with red (pH 5.51) and calcareous soils (pH 8.12) collected from Hunan Province and Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, respectively, including four different treatments as follows: CK (no fertilizer), U (only urea), UM (60% urea-N plus cattle manure-N), UMCP (UM + nitrapyrin). The results showed that UMCP treatment significantly increased retention time of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) in both red and calcareous soils (P < 0.05), compared with the treatments of CK, U and UM. The inhibitory efficiency of nitrapyrin, based on the ratio of NH4+-N/NO3-N, was nearly twice higher in calcareous soil (71 days) than that in red soil (36 days). The potential nitrification rates (PNR) were significantly increased by the urea or urea plus manure application, but were greatly reduced by nitrapyrin addition. Nitrapyrin addition significantly inhibited the gene abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in calcareous soil, whereas inhibited the ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) growth in red soil. UMCP treatment lowered N2O emissions and increased N recovery compared with UM. Linear regression analysis showed that PNR was positively correlated with AOB (P = 0.048) and AOA abundance (P = 0.0014) in red soil, but only correlated with AOB (P = 0.0032) in calcareous soil. Random forest and structural equation model (SEM) analyses revealed that pH, NH4+-N and organic carbon (SOC) were the key factors affecting the abundance of AOA and AOB, and AOA contributes more to N2O emissions than AOB from red soil, whilst only AOB is highly responsible for the N2O production from calcareous soil. Our result suggests that nitrapyrin plus organic amendment could be serving as an effective fertilization scenario on mitigating N2O emissions and enhancing N recovery and utilization in acidic and alkaline soils.					hu, baowei/T-2476-2019														0929-1393	1873-0272				OCT	2021	166								104062	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104062		MAY 2021											WOS:000679311300005

In this investigation, solution combustion synthesis is used for fabrication of Ni-10wt% Al2O3 nanocomposite. Nickel and aluminum nitrates, urea, and distilled water are used as oxidizer, fuel, and solvent, respectively. The results show that if the fuel to oxidizer ratio exceeds the stoichiometric ratio, the combustion temperature increases.

Metabolomics Based Identification of SIRT5 and Protein Kinase C Epsilon Regulated Pathways in Brain	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE												The role of Sirtuins in brain function is emerging, yet little is known about SIRT5 in this domain. Our previous work demonstrates that protein kinase C epsilon (PKC epsilon)-induced protection from focal ischemia is lost in SIRT5(-/-) mice. Thus, metabolic regulation by SIRT5 contributes significantly to ischemic tolerance. The aim of this study was to identify the SIRT5-regulated metabolic pathways in the brain and determine which of those pathways are linked to PKC epsilon. Our results show SIRT5 is primarily expressed in neurons and endothelial cells in the brain, with mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial localization. Pathway and enrichment analysis of non-targeted primarymetabolite profiles from Sirt5(-/-) cortex revealed alterations in several pathways including purinemetabolism (urea, adenosine, adenine, xanthine), nitrogen metabolism (glutamic acid, glycine), and malate-aspartate shuttle (malic acid, glutamic acid). Additionally, perturbations in beta-oxidation and carnitine transferase (pentadecanoic acid, heptadecanoic acid) and glutamate transport and glutamine synthetase (urea, xylitol, adenine, adenosine, glycine, glutamic acid) were predicted. Metabolite changes in SIRT5(-/-) coincided with alterations in expression of amino acid (SLC7A5, SLC7A7) and glutamate (EAAT2) transport proteins as well as key enzymes in purine (PRPS1, PPAT), fatty acid (ACADS, HADHB), glutamine-glutamate (GAD1, GLUD1), and malate-aspartate shuttle (MDH1) metabolic pathways. Moreover, PKC epsilon activation induced alternations in purine metabolites (urea, glutamine) that overlapped with putative SIRT5 pathways in WT but not in SIRT5(-/-) mice. Finally, we found that purine metabolism is a common metabolic pathway regulated by SIRT5, PKC epsilon and ischemic preconditioning. These results implicate Sirt5 in the regulation of pathways central to brain metabolism, with links to ischemic tolerance.

Thermal and isothermal denaturation monitored by the tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism, respectively, implied lower stability of cyt c state IV in comparison with the state III. The pK(a) value of alkaline isomerization of cyt c depended on the present salts, i.e., kosmotropic anions increased and chaotropic anions decreased pK(a) (Hofmeister effect on protein stability). The peroxidase activity of cyt c in the state III, measured by oxidation of guaiacol, showed clear dependence on the salt position in the Hofmeister series, while cyt c in the alkaline state lacked the peroxidase activity regardless of the type of anions present in the solution. The alkaline isomerization of cyt c in the presence of 8 M urea, measured by Trp59 fluorescence, implied an existence of a high-affinity non-native ligand for the heme iron even in a partially denatured protein conformation. The conformation of the cyt c alkaline state in 8 M urea was considerably modulated by the specific effect of anions. Based on the Trp59 fluorescence quenching upon titration to alkaline pH in 8 M urea and molecular dynamics simulation, we hypothesize that the Lys79 conformer is most likely the predominant alkaline conformer of cyt c. The high affinity of the sixth ligand for the heme iron is likely a reason of the lack of peroxidase activity of cyt c in the alkaline state.

The present study aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic and anti-diabetic nephropathy activities of polysaccharides separated from Auricularia auricular (AAP). Diet streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats were orally treated with metformin (100 mg/kg; positive control) and AAP (100 and 400 mg/kg) for four weeks, and parameters in the serum and liver associated with blood glucose, free radicals and nephropathy were determined. Similar to metformin, AAP treatment strongly reduced blood glucose levels by promoting glucose metabolism. The anti-oxidative activity of AAP, which was indicated by the modulation of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, reactive oxygen species and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde levels in serum, was observed in diabetic rats. Furthermore, the regulatory effects of AAP on blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric protein and inflammatory-related factors revealed its protection against diabetic nephropathy. The present data suggests that AAP-mediated anti-diabetic and anti-nephritic effects are partially associated with their modulations on the anti-oxidative system and nuclear factor kappa B-related signaling pathway. In conclusion, AAP has potential to be a novel source of treatments for diabetes.					hu, xinyu/GYU-4240-2022; Sun, Xiaoqi/B-2800-2016														1792-0981	1792-1015				JAN	2017	13	1					352	358		10.3892/etm.2016.3943	http://dx.doi.org/10.3892/etm.2016.3943								28123514					WOS:000393018600057
J	Zhang, YH; Lou, DM; Tan, PQ; Hu, ZY				Zhang, Yunhua; Lou, Diming; Tan, Piqiang; Hu, Zhiyuan			Experimental study on the particulate matter and nitrogenous compounds from diesel engine retrofitted with DOC plus CDPF plus SCR	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The increasingly stringent emission regulations will mandate the retrofit of after-treatment devices for in-use diesel vehicles, in order to reduce their substantial particulate matter and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions. In this paper, a combination of DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst), CDPF (catalytic diesel particulate filter) and SCR (selective catalytic reduction) retrofit for a heavy-duty diesel engine was employed to perform experiment on the engine test bench to evaluate the effects on the particulate matter emissions including particle number (PN), particle mass (PM), particle size distributions and nitrogenous compounds emissions including NOX, nitrogen dioxide (NO2)/NOX, nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) slip. In addition, the urea injection was also of our concern. The results showed that the DOC+CDPF+SCR retrofit almost had no adverse effect on the engine power and fuel consumption. Under the test loads, the upstream DOC and CDPF reduced the PN and PM by an average of 91.6% and 90.9%, respectively. While the downstream SCR brought about an average decrease of 85% NOX. Both PM and NOX emission factors based on this retrofit were lower than China-IV limits (ESC), and even lower than China-V limits (ESC) at medium and high loads. The DOC and CDPF changed the particle size distributions, leading to the increase in the proportion of accumulation mode particles and the decrease in the percentage of nuclear mode particles. This indicates that the effect of DOC and CDPF on nuclear mode particles was better than that of accumulation mode ones. The upstream DOC could increase the NO2/NOX ratio to 40%, higher NO2/NOX ratio improved the efficiency of CDPF and SCR. Besides, the N2O emission increased by an average of 2.58 times after the retrofit and NH3 slip occurred with the average of 26.7 ppm. The rate of urea injection was roughly equal to 8% of the fuel consumption rate. The DOC+CDPF+SCR retrofit was proved a feasible and effective measurement in terms of reducing particulate emissions and NOX simultaneously for in-use engine. However, it also resulted in higher N2O emission, NH3 slip as well as urea injecting strategy problem which should be of further concern.

J	Zaib, Q; Eckelman, MJ; Yang, Y; Kyung, D				Zaib, Qammer; Eckelman, Matthew J.; Yang, Yi; Kyung, Daeseung			Are deep eutectic solvents really green?: A life-cycle perspective	GREEN CHEMISTRY												Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have generated great interest as promising green alternatives to replace conventional solvents due to their application-specific tunability, nonflamability, variable viscosity, low vapor pressure, and chemical (and thermal) stability. However, their greenness or sustainability remains unclear and requires rigorous quantification. This work uses life-cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts incurred from the production of a representative choline chloride (ChCl)/urea DES, reline. The environmental profile of reline is compared with that of common organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, dichloromethane (DCM), and ethyl acetate) on the basis of their utilization as a solvent for the oxidation of alcohol to the ketone; acetophenone. The results indicate that, in general, the DES imparts lower environmental impacts than DCM and ethyl acetate but has higher impacts than methanol and ethanol. Chemical constituent materials (urea, trimethylamine, hydrochloric acid, and ethylene oxide) required for the synthesis of reline DES contribute significantly to its life-cycle environmental impacts when compared to auxiliary processes. In addition to reline, the LCA of four other ChCl-based DESs is performed by substituting urea (hydrogen bond donor in the reline) with ethylene glycol, glycerol, citric acid, or glucose. ChCl/citric acid DES, the so-called natural deep eutectic solvent, imposes the highest environmental impacts among the studied ChCl-based DESs. This is partly due to the high water consumption and carbon dioxide emission during fermentation to synthesize the citric acid. Our study challenges the greennesses of DESs but more research with better data is required to corroborate our findings as some key inputs were modeled from a commercial patent.

In this work, we found that papain displayed peroxidase-like activity and catalyzed the oxidation of 3,3 0,5 0,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2. This results in the formation of a blue colored product with an absorption maximum at 652 nm. The effects of experimental parameters including pH and reaction temperature on catalytic activity of papain were investigated. The increase of absorbance induced by the catalytic effect of papain offers accurate detection of H2O2 in the range of 5.00-90.0 mM, along with a detection limit of 2.10 mM. A facile colorimetric method for glucose detection was also proposed by combining the glucose oxidase (GOx)-catalyzed glucose oxidation and papain-catalyzed TMB oxidation, which exhibited a linear response in the range of 0.05-0.50 mM with a detection limit of 0.025 mM. The method proposed here displayed excellent selectivity, indicating that common coexisting substances (urea, uric acid, ascorbic acid, maltose, lactose and fructose) in urine did not interfere with detection of glucose. More importantly, the suggested method was successfully used to precisely detect the glucose concentration in human urine samples with recoveries over 96.0%.					chen, yuye/HHD-1212-2022; Wang, lujie/ISB-4356-2023	yilin, wang/0000-0002-7597-4489														2046-2069				MAY 28	2019	9	29					16566	16570		10.1039/c9ra03111a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra03111a								35516354					WOS:000470753700032

The dog diet is normally composed of chicken or fish meat, which represents a good source of protein and fat. However, fish and chicken meat contain a high amount of lipids susceptible to oxidation, which could alter the beneficial effects of the dog food. The addition of antioxidant compounds to the diet might improve the quality of the diet and, consequently, the health of the animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two commercially available fish- (FH) and chicken (CH)-based diets and the same diets combined with antioxidant compounds, e.g., FH-AOX and CH-AOX, respectively, on biochemical parameters and blood fatty acid (FA) profile. For this purpose, 28 dogs were allocated to four groups and fed the four diets for six months. Blood samples were taken before starting the experimental period and at the end of the trial. Concerning the biochemical parameters, the animals fed CH-AOX reached the highest values for ALB compared to the animals fed CH or FH-AOX; however, the values were within the reference values for old dogs. Triglycerides and urea were significantly higher in FH compared to the CH diet; however, both FH-AOX and CH-AOX showed a marked decrease in the TRI and urea concentration with respect to FH and CH. Moreover, CH-AOX and FH-AOX increased glucose values, linoleic acid content, and polyunsaturated FA n-3 with respect to FH and CH. On the contrary, arachidonic acid was lower in the CH-AOX and FH-AOX groups. In conclusion, FH led to a better FA profile than that of the CH diet, while CH-AOX and FH-AOX improved the FA profile regardless of the basal diet.

On the other hand, pioglitazone, which represents peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist recently showed antiinflamatory, antioxidative effects, amelioration of endothelial dysfunction etc. Therefore, the goal of our study was to investigate the effects of pioglitazone on kidney injury in an experimental model of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. These effects were observed by following values of biochemical (serum urea and creatinine) parametars, total histological kidney score, urine level of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as well as parametars of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, total oxidant status, total antioxidant status, oxidative stress index and advanced oxidation protein products). It seems that pioglitazone protects the injured rat kidney in a U-shaped manner. Medium dose of pioglitazone (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was protective regarding biochemical (serum urea and creatinine), total histological score and the values of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) (P < 0.05 vs. control group, i.e. rats injected with gentamicin only). This finding could be of great importance for the wider use of aminoglycosides, with therapy that would reduce the occurrence of serious adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity and acute renal failure.

Herein, the theoretic predications and experimental investigations that non-electroactive Zn behaves as an effective promoter for CoP-catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline media is reported. Density function theory calculations reveal that Zn doing leads to more thermal-neutral hydrogen adsorption free energy and thus enhanced HER activity for CoP catalyst. Electrochemical tests show that a Zn0.08Co0.92P nanowall array on titanium mesh (Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM) needs overpotentials of only 39 and 67 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 1.0 m KOH, respectively. This Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM is also superior in activity over CoP/TM for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), driving 115 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V in 1.0 m KOH with 0.5 m urea. The high HER and UOR activity of this bifunctional electrode enables a Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM-based two-electrode electrolyzer for energy-saving hydrogen production, offering 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.38 V with strong long-term electrochemical stability.

Different from the direct copolymerization route that suffers from the problem of mismatched physical properties of acetamide (or formamide) with urea, the synthesis of AHCN(x) (or FHCNx) starts from a crucial preorganization step of acetamide (or formamide) with urea via freeze drying-hydrothermal treatment so that the chemical structures as well as C-doping level in AHCN(x) and N-vacancy concentration in FHCNx can be precisely regulated. By using various structural characterization methods, well-defined AHCN(x) and FHCNx structures are proposed. At the optimal C-doping level in AHCN(x) or N-vacancy concentration in FHCNx, both AHCN(x) and FHCNx exhibit remarkably improved visible-light photocatalytic performance in oxidation of emerging organic pollutants (acetaminophen and methylparaben) and reduction of proton to H-2 in comparison of unmodified g-C3N4. Combination of the experimental results with theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that AHCN(x) and FHCNx show different charge separation and transfer mechanisms, while the enhanced visible-light harvesting capacity and the localized charge distributions on HOMO and LUMO are responsible for this excellent photocatalytic redox performance of AHCN(x) and FHCNx.

We effectively synthesized a uniform and mesoporous BiZnSbV-G-SiO2 (BZSVGS) quaternary nanocomposite by electrodeposition on a Ni foam substrate. This BiZnSbV-G-SiO2@NF composite terminal has been used as an electrocatalyst for coordinated oxidation of glucose, in this manner acting as a high-performance non-enzymatic glucose sensor. Coordinated electrochemical estimation with the as-arranged anodes in PBS and urea showed that the BiZnSbV-G-SiO2 nanocomposite has a great electrocatalytic movement toward glucose oxidation in a neutral medium and a wide straight reaction from 0.06 to 0.1 mu mol/L, a low detection constraint of 0.06 mu mol/L (S/N = 3) at a low connected potential of + 0.20 V vs Ag/AgCl. This ponder moreover highlights the effect of diminishing anion electronegativity on upgrading the electrocatalytic proficiency by bringing down the potential required for glucose oxidation and long-term steadiness together with a brief reaction time of roughly 4 s highlights the promising execution of the BiZnSbV-G-SiO2@NF anode for non-enzymatic glucose detection with high accuracy and unwavering quality. Besides, it can be used for glucose location in human blood serum, promising its application toward assurance of glucose in genuine tests.

J	Gat, D; Ronen, Z; Tsesarsky, M				Gat, Daniella; Ronen, Zeev; Tsesarsky, Michael			Long-term sustainability of microbial-induced CaCO3 precipitation in aqueous media	CHEMOSPHERE												Microbially induced CaCO3 precipitation (MICP) via urea hydrolysis is an emerging technique for soil amelioration, building materials rehabilitation and pollutants sequestration amongst other various environmental applications. The successful application of MICP requires the sustainability of the precipitated CaCO3; to which the fate of ammonia, the main by-product of ureolysis, is potentially significante. Ammonia volatilization and biological ammonia oxidation both induce a pH decrease, which, in turn, might cause CaCO3 dissolution. To examine the potential effect of accumulated ammonia on precipitated CaCO3, we conducted a long-term MICP batch experiment, using environmental enrichment cultures of ureolytic bacteria. Here we show that CaCO3 precipitation was completed within 15-27 days, along with a rise in ammonium concentration. Following completion of ureolysis and precipitation, ammonium concentrations decreased, leading to a pH decrease. About 30 days after precipitation was completed, as much as 30% CaCO3 dissolution, was observed. A two-step model, describing urea hydrolysis followed by the removal of ammonia from the precipitation solution, predicted CaCO3 dissolution due to ammonia volatilization. We suggest that ureolytic MICP might result in ammonia volatilization, leading to significant CaCO3 dissolution. These results provide basic insights into the sustainability of ureolytic MICP and should further encourage removal of the accumulated ammonia from the treated site. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One of them, Pcal_1311, does not display a significantly high homology with any of the characterized alcohol dehydrogenases. Highest homology of 38% was found with the characterized counterpart from Geobacillus stearothermophilus. To examine the biochemical properties of Pcal_1311, we have cloned and functionally expressed the gene in Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant Pcal_1311 catalyzed the NAD(H)-dependent oxidation of various alcohols and reduction of aldehydes, with a marked preference for substrates with functional group at the terminal carbon. Highest activity for the oxidation reaction (3 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1)) was found with 1,4-butanediol and for the reduction reaction (150 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1)) with glutaraldehyde. Both the oxidation and reduction activities increased with the increase in temperature up to 80 A degrees C. Recombinant Pcal_1311 was highly stable and retained more than 90% activity even after incubation of 180 min at 90 A degrees C. In addition to the thermostabilty, Pcal_1311 was highly stable in the presence of known denaturants including urea and guanidine hydrochloride. The high stability, particularly thermostability, and the NADH-dependent aldehyde reduction activity make Pcal_1311 a unique member in the alcohol dehydrogenase family.

Developing superhydrophobic coatings with excellent durability is important, yet extremely challenging. Since the interfacial bonding offered by the essential low-surface-energy property is too limited to maintain surface textures. Herein, a well-tailored strategy is proposed to address the interfacial weakness by introducing efficient adhesive functional moieties into the low surface energy polymer structures employed for constructing superhydrophobic coatings. Catechol and urea groups were selected as key functional moieties and were homogeneously dispersed within the silicone network by being constructed as crosslinkers. In addition, the urea moiety effectively suppressed the oxidation failure of the catechol moiety because of the molecular encapsulation effect which functioned through the hydrogen-bonded intermolecular interactions. Owing to the synergistic enhancement of the two adhesion functional moieties, the optimized superhydrophobic coating showed over fivefold boost in mechanical stability, tolerating 40 m of sandpaper abrasion and 250 cycles of tape peeling. Superhydrophobicity was also well kept after various harsh environmental tests including chemical corrosion, UV aging, and extreme temperatures. This novel approach indicates a feasible way to enhance durability and will contribute to the practical application of superhydrophobic coatings.					zhu, jialong/KHY-2523-2024	Wang, Wen-Jun/0000-0002-9740-2924													1385-8947	1873-3212				JAN 1	2025	503								158605	10.1016/j.cej.2024.158605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.158605		DEC 2024											WOS:001391936300001

The exhaust temperature of the 59.3% working conditions is lower than 200 degrees C under the cold start WHTC, and the average temperature of which is 196 degrees C, the urea injection system is in the state of stopping in most of time under cold start WHTC. The effects of intake throttle valve opening on NOx emission, fuel and urea consumption were studied in steady conditions with medium and low load. The 15-20% opening of intake throttle valve could increase the exhaust temperature to more than 200 degrees C when the torque is less than 250 N-m. The NOx emission weighted value of the WHTC is reduced by 41.5%, which could meet the requirements of the Europe V emission regulations for WHTC test cycle, but the fuel economy increase slightly. The Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) could increase the NO2/NOx ratio in the exhaust gas effectively, and increase the NOx conversion efficiency in the temperature range of 200-400 degrees C, which reduce the NOx emission weighted value of the diesel engine under WHTC by 8.7%.					min, liu/AAX-1641-2021; Wang, Guihua/B-4458-2010														1359-4311					SEP	2018	142						421	432		10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.07.042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.07.042													WOS:000443663300038

In situ molecular imaging of endogenous levels of the melanoma biomarker tyrosinase (TYR) may decrease the likelihood of mortality. In this study, we proposed the weakly fluorescent probe 1-(4-(2-(4-(dicyanomethylene)-4H-chromen-2-yl)vinyl)phenyl)-3-(4-hydroxybenzyl)urea (DCM-HBU), which releases a strong red-shifted fluorescent signal after a TYR-mediated oxidation followed by hydrolysis of the urea linkage. The large Stokes shift of the dye is owed to the recovery of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. The resulting probe derivate shows a highly ratiometric fluorescence output. Furthermore, the simultaneous excitation by two near-infrared (NIR) photons of the released derivative of dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran (DCM-NH2) fluorophore could avoid the usual drawbacks, such as cellular absorption, autofluorescence, and light scattering, due to an usually short wavelength of the excitation light on biological systems, resulting in images with deeper tissue penetration. In addition, the probe is useful for the quantitative sensing of TYR activity in vivo, as demonstrated in zebrafish larvae. This new ratiometric two-photon NIR fluorescent probe is expected to be useful for the accurate detection of TYR in complex biosystems at greater depths than other one-photon excited fluorescent probes.

At the moment, enhancing the intrinsic activity of CN catalysts by tuning the interfacial coupling between catalyst and substrate remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that urea-derived carbon nitride catalysts with the abundant -NH2 groups and the relative positive charged surface could effectively complex with the deprotonated anionic intermediate to improve the adsorption of organic reactants on the catalyst surface. The decreased oxidation potential and upshift in its highest occupied molecular orbital position make the electron abstraction kinetics by the catalyst more energetically favorable. The prepared catalyst is thus utilized for the photocatalytic cyclization of nitrogen-centered radicals for the synthesis of diverse pharmaceutical-related compounds (33 examples) with high activity and reusability, which shows competent performance to the homogeneous catalysts. Carbon nitride catalysts with positively charged surfaces and abundant -NH2 are found to be effective photocatalysts for dihydropyrazole synthesis. A surface-mediated mechanism where deprotonated intermediates interact with the surface is proposed.

UV-irradiation of self-assembled triphenylamines affords persistent and regenerable radicals	CHEMICAL SCIENCE												UV-irradiation of assembled urea-tethered triphenylamine dimers results in the formation of persistent radicals, whereas radicals generated in solution are reactive and quickly degrade. In the solid-state, high quantities of radicals (approximately 1 in 150 molecules) are formed with a half-life of one week with no significant change in the single crystal X-ray diffraction. Remarkably, after decay, re-irradiation of the solid sample regenerates the radicals to their original concentration. The photophysics upon radical generation are also altered. Both the absorption and emission are significantly quenched without external oxidation likely due to the delocalization of the radicals within the crystals. The factors that influence radical stability and generation are correlated to the rigid supramolecular framework formed by the urea tether of the triphenylamine dimer. Electrochemical evidence demonstrates that these compounds can be oxidized in solution at 1.0 V vs. SCE to generate radical cations, whose EPR spectra were compared with spectra of the solid-state photogenerated radicals. Additionally, these compounds display changes in emission due to solvent effects from fluorescence to phosphorescence. Understanding how solid-state assembly alters the photophysical properties of triphenylamines could lead to further applications of these compounds for magnetic and conductive materials.

XPS analysis, voltammetric, and impedance characteristics of novel heterogeneous biphosphates based on Cu/Ni for tri(ammonium) phosphate oxidation: A new direction for material processing in fuel technology	FUEL												Biphosphate has emerged as a promising electrocatalyst material for anodic reactions because of its intermetallic characteristics and improved electron transfer in addition to its low-cost strategy. However, the preparation strategy could be adjusted and compared to understand which method is better (reflux or sol-gel method). Here, bi phosphates of Cu & Ni were studied and synthesized by two familiar methods: reflux method (CuNiPh-Ref) and sol-gel method (CuNiPh-SGl) as non-precious working electrodes (anodes) for tri(ammonium) phosphate (TAP) electrooxidation. The studied materials were chemically described by variable techniques to understand their surface chemistry and morphology in addition to the influence of the design methodology on these characteristics. Interestingly, the preparation method significantly affects the observed morphology. For CuNiPh-SGl, the sol-gel technique was utilized which gives a suitable condition for the growth of pores between particles. For CuNiPh-Ref material, it was chemically fabricated by the traditional reflux which has a limited time for particle growth and so, more agglomeration particles were observed. The electrochemical performance of CuNiPh-Ref and CuNiPh-SGl as anodes for the TAP anodic process was studied in terms of voltammetric, chronoamperometric, and impedance analyses. The prepared CuNiPh-SGl has better TAP electrooxidation if compared with CuNiPh-Ref which could be due to the porosity, morphology, and easier electron transfer. These biphosphates provide a promising strategy for introducing novel non-precious electrodes for novel fuel technology.

Metal-free graphene-based catalytic membrane for degradation of organic contaminants by persulfate activation	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												The persulfate (PS) activation can be successfully applied in water treatment and the use of carbon materials to activate PS has been thoroughly described in the literature. Nevertheless, the prospect of employing a metal-free catalytic membrane as the single activator of PS has to be better studied. In the present work, graphite oxide was prepared by the modified Hummers' method and different nitrogen precursors (melamine, urea and gaseous ammonia) were investigated to produce N-doped graphene oxide catalysts. The material prepared with melamine presented the highest nitrogen content (23.78 wt%) and the highest catalytic activity for the degradation of phenol in aqueous solution. The membrane fabricated with this catalyst was applied in filtration experiments for the degradation of phenol and oxalic acid. The catalytic mechanism is governed by both the radical and the non-radical degradation of the pollutants, but a more notorious contribution of singlet oxygen species was observed. It was demonstrated that the membrane lost the N-pyridinic groups during the reaction and, as consequence, part of its catalytic activity, whereas N-quaternary species remained in the used membrane. An important advantage associated with the application of this metal-free catalytic membrane, instead of a catalyst in powder form, is to avoid the final catalyst separation step.

Surfactant effects on the synthesis of porous cerium oxide from a type IV deep eutectic solvent	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A												In this work we present a novel, low temperature and green method for atom-efficient solvothermal synthesis of crystalline, micelle templated cerium IV oxide (ceria) from a type IV deep eutectic solvent (DES) comprising a hydrated cerium containing metal salt, cerium(iii) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O), and a hydrogen bond donor, urea, in a molar ratio of 1 : 3.5. Self-assembled nanostructures of ionic and non-ionic surfactants have been recently reported in a cerium nitrate hexahydrate : urea DES [Manasi et al., J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 155, 084902], which can be exploited to produce nano-templated ceria from these solution. In this work, we have used high concentration (20% w/w) solutions of C-12 and C-16 alkyl chain length cationic surfactants (C(n)TAB and C(n)TANO(3)) and C-16 alkyl chain length non-ionic surfactant BrijC(10) in the DES to alter the porosity of the cerium oxide produced. The characterisation of the cerium oxide has been carried out using SEM/TEM, N-2 sorption, SAXS and TPR to understand and quantify the nature of the crystallinity, morphology and porosity along with CO oxidation for the catalytic activity of the material. The cerium oxide produced by this method has porosity on the 2-5 nm scale and a BET surface area between 40 and 150 m(2) g(-1) depending on the amount and type of surfactant. Materials prepared using halide-free cationic surfactants show superior catalytic activity and low activation energies along with high porosity and present potential for improved ceria performance in many industrial applications.

Protein to Maximize Whole-Body Anabolism in Resistance-trained Females after Exercise	MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS & EXERCISE												Introduction Current athlete-specific protein recommendations are based almost exclusively on research in males. Purpose Using the minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation technique, we determined the daily protein intake that maximizes whole-body protein synthesis (PS) and net protein balance (NB) after exercise in strength-trained females. Methods Eight resistance-trained females (23 +/- 3.5 yr, 67.0 +/- 7.7 kg, 163.3 +/- 3.7 cm, 24.4% +/- 6.9% body fat; mean +/- SD) completed a 2-d controlled diet during the luteal phase before performing an acute bout of whole-body resistance exercise. During recovery, participants consumed eight hourly meals providing a randomized test protein intake (0.2-2.9 g center dot kg(-1)center dot d(-1)) as crystalline amino acids modeled after egg protein, with constant phenylalanine (30.5 mg center dot kg(-1)center dot d(-1)) and excess tyrosine (40.0 mg center dot kg(-1)center dot d(-1)) intakes. Steady-state whole-body phenylalanine rate of appearance (Ra), oxidation (Ox; the reciprocal of PS), and NB (PS - Ra) were determined from oral [C-13] phenylalanine ingestion. Total protein oxidation was estimated from the urinary urea-creatinine ratio (U/Cr). Results A mixed model biphase linear regression revealed a break point (i.e., estimated average requirement) of 1.49 +/- 0.44 g center dot kg(-1)center dot d(-1) (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) in Ox (r(2) = 0.64) and 1.53 +/- 0.32 g center dot kg(-1)center dot d(-1) in NB (r(2) = 0.65), indicating a saturation in whole-body anabolism. U/Cr increased linearly with protein intake (r(2) = 0.56, P < 0.01). Conclusions Findings from this investigation indicate that the safe protein intake (upper 95% confidence interval) to maximize anabolism and minimize protein oxidation for strength-trained females during the early similar to 8-h postexercise recovery period is at the upper end of the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine for athletes (i.e., 1.2-2.0 g center dot kg(-1)center dot d(-1)).

MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY												Tissue accumulation and high urinary excretion of argininosuccinate (ASA) is the biochemical hallmark of argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD), a urea cycle disorder mainly characterized by neurologic abnormalities, whose pathogenesis is still unknown. Thus, in the present work, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effects of ASA on a large spectrum of oxidative stress parameters in brain of adolescent rats in order to test whether disruption of redox homeostasis could be involved in neurodegeneration of this disorder. ASA provoked in vitro lipid and protein oxidation, decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations, and increased reactive oxygen species generation in cerebral cortex and striatum. Furthermore, these effects were totally prevented or attenuated by the antioxidants melatonin and GSH. Similar results were obtained by intrastriatal administration of ASA, in addition to increased reactive nitrogen species generation and decreased activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase. It was also observed that melatonin and N-acetylcysteine prevented most of ASA-induced in vivo pro-oxidant effects in striatum. Taken together, these data indicate that disturbance of redox homeostasis induced at least in part by high brain ASA concentrations per se may potentially represent an important pathomechanism of neurodegeneration in patients with ASLD and that therapeutic trials with appropriate antioxidants may be an adjuvant treatment for these patients.

Synthesis and characterization of N-modified titania nanotubes for photocatalytic applications	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH					7th Congress of Environmental Application of Advanced Oxidation Technologies (7 EPOA) / 1st Iberoamerican Congress of Advanced Oxidation Technologies (1 CIPOA)	OCT 15-18, 2013	Recife, BRAZIL					The modification of titanate nanotubes (TiNT) with nitrogen (NTiNT) was accomplished through impregnation method. TiNT were synthesized via hydrothermal treatment of titania powders in NaOH solution at 130 degrees C for 48 h. The obtained samples were characterized by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, XRD, TEM, XPS, and TG analysis. Structure, morphology, composition, and visible light absorption property of nitrogen-modified TiO2 nanotubes are found to depend on the nitrogen content and not on the calcination temperature for the range used in this work. The photocatalytic activity of these nanotubes was investigated for the degradation of methylethylketone (MEK) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) under ultraviolet and solar light radiation. MEK is very resistant to photocatalytic degradation with the prepared materials;, however, the results show that modification of the TiNT with nitrogen in a proportion of 1 to 1 (TiNT to urea weight ratio) and calcination at 400 degrees C lead to materials with high photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet radiation and moderate photocatalytic activity under solar radiation for degradation of H2S.					; Monteiro, Ricardo/F-6128-2019; Boaventura, Rui/K-1786-2014; Silva, Adrian/J-3346-2013	Vilar, Vitor/0000-0003-0943-2144; Monteiro, Ricardo/0000-0003-0951-9813; Boaventura, Rui/0000-0002-3000-5748; Silva, Adrian/0000-0001-8551-6353													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2015	22	2					810	819		10.1007/s11356-014-2943-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2943-3								24798920					WOS:000348047400007

The obtained material (Fe3O4@C-BH) promoted the persulfate (PS) activation for degradation of organic contaminants. The nano-Fe3O4 particles were confirmed to be encapsulated in carbon spheres by systematic characterization. In virtue of the protective effect of carbon coating, the problems of being prone to agglomeration and oxidation of Fe3O4 were improved. Fe3O4@C-BH featured the effective catalytic performance to activate PS for RB5 degradation. The removal and mineralization rates of RB5 were 95.8% and 65%, respectively. The pH of the initial solution and the inorganic anions (Cl- and SO42-) had little effect on the degradation of reactive black 5 (RB5). Further, it performed high removal efficiency for Congo Red (CR), Rhodamine B (RhB) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC). Notably, the increase of oxygen functional groups and Fe2+ content on the carbon surface by KHB4 modification was considered to be the main reason for improving catalytic activity. By analyzing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and quenching experiments, SO4 center dot-, center dot OH and O-1(2) were the primary active substances in oxidation process. A plausible mechanism was proposed in which the encapsulated Fe3O4 nano, oxygen functional groups and doped nitrogen synergistically drove PS activation to remove organic contaminants. It provides new insights into developing efficient core-shell carbon-based materials as PS activators for organic contaminants degradation in groundwater.

Although green tea catechins (GTCs) are known to improve exercise endurance by enhancing lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle, little is known about the relationship between ammonia metabolism and the endurance-improving effect of GTCs. Here, we examined how ammonia affects endurance capacity and how GTCs affect ammonia metabolism in vivo in mice and how GTCs affect mouse skeletal muscle and liver in vitro. In mice, blood ammonia concentration was significantly negatively correlated with exercise endurance capacity, and hyperammonaemia was found to decrease whole-body fat expenditure and fatty acid oxidation-related gene expression in skeletal muscle. Repeated ingestion of GTCs combined with regular exercise training improved endurance capacity and the expression of urea cycle-related genes in liver. In C2C12 myotubes, hyperammonaemia suppressed mitochondrial respiration; however, pre-incubation with GTCs rescued this suppression. Together, our results demonstrate that hyperammonaemia decreases both mitochondrial respiration in myotubes and whole-body aerobic metabolism. Thus, GTC-mediated increases in ammonia metabolism in liver and resistance to ammonia-induced suppression of mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle may underlie the endurance-improving effect of GTCs.

The new GCE/AgNPs/P(Arg)-GO electrode exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for AA, DA, UA and L-Trp. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized to characterize the surface morphology of the composite electrode. Electrochemical characterizations of the bare and composite electrodes were carried out via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). According to differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) results, there were linear relationships between the peak currents and the concentrations in the ranges of 4.0-2400.0 mu mol L-1 for AA, 0.05-50.0 mu mol L-1 for DA, 0.5-150.0 mu mol L-1 for UA and 1.0-150 mu mol L-1 for L-TRP, with the detection limits (3 s/m) of 0.984, 0.01, 0.142 and 0.122 mu mol L-1 for AA, DA, UA and L-TRP, respectively. The modified electrode could eliminate the interference effects of Na+, K+, L-lysine, glucose, L-cysteine, urea and citric acid. Furthermore, the sensor was successfully applied for the detection of these substances in the human urine samples, and it showed a very high recovery percentage.

These Au/M0x nanocomposites have been characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and inductively coupled plasma atom emission spectroscopy. They have been used at room temperature as catalytic filters for CO oxidation in humid atmosphere (RH 40%). The CO removal efficiency has been evaluated using metal oxide gas sensors (MOS) device. The catalytic performances assessment of these Au/MOx nanocomposites highlights the efficiency of the Au/ZnO system. An integrated sensing device comprising the gas sensor and its catalytic filter has been developed. In that case, a plastic holder filled with low amounts (50 mg) of Au/ZnO catalytic filter is simply placed above the MOS sensor. This system allows the improvement of the selectivity of the MOS sensors towards other gases, i.e. propane. The presented setting can be applied as one of valuable addition for multi-array sensor devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reactivity of an Fe<SUP>IV</SUP>-Oxo Complex with Protons and Oxidants	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												High-valent Fe-OH species are often invoked as key intermediates but have only been observed in Compound II of cytochrome P450s. To further address the properties of non-heme Few-OH complexes, we demonstrate the reversible protonation of a synthetic Fe-IV-oxo species containing a tris-urea tripodal ligand. The same protonated Fe-IV-oxo species can be prepared via oxidation, suggesting that a putative Fe-V-oxo species was initially generated. Computational, Mossbauer, XAS, and NRVS studies indicate that protonation of the Fe-IV-oxo complex most likely occurs on the tripodal ligand, which undergoes a structural change that results in the formation of a new intramolecular H-bond with the oxido ligand that aids in stabilizing the protonated adduct. We suggest that similar protonated high-valent Fe-oxo species may occur in the active sites of proteins. This finding further argues for caution when assigning unverified high-valent Fe-OH species to mechanisms.

All catalysts were prepared by homogeneous deposition precipitation using urea as the precursor for the precipitating agent. The SCR activity followed the order Mn/gamma-Al2O3 > Cu/gamma-Al2O3 > Co/gamma-Al2O3. The nanocatalysts were characterized with respect to their texture (N-2-BET), particle size (TEM), reducibility (H-2-TPR), and acidity (NH3-TPD). The TEM analysis revealed that the metal species have superior dispersion with less agglomeration and sintering on gamma-Al2O3 support. The H-2-TPR results con firmed that the Mn/gamma-Al2O3 nanocatalyst contains various oxidation states of manganese, which is useful for the catalyst to maintain the DeNO activities. The NH3-TPD studies indicated that the addition of transition metal can significantly increase the surface acidity and Mn/gamma-Al2O3 showed the most adsorbed sites of NH3. Characterization results indicated that the acidity and the redox properties of the catalyst play important roles in the final catalytic activity in the SCR-NO process.

As-prepared samples are labeled as SCO(Gl)and SCO(Ur)The acid-base properties of the cavities and surfaces of specimens are determined by measuring the pH of zero charges. Both SCO(Gl)and SCO(Ur)powders are decorated by the nanostructured Pd (NSPd) by the wetness incorporation. The NSPd-SCO(Gl)and NSPd-SCO(Ur)represent the high mass current density than NSPd as non-supported palladium for the electrooxidation of single-carbon molecules: methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid. The results show that the NSPd-SCO(Gl)and NSPd-SCO(Ur)are exceptional heterogeneous catalysts. The SCO as the support with porous structural network has been affected considerably on the electrochemical surface area, dispersion, and durability of NSPd. On the other hand, it can be effective for removing the poisoning species of the electrooxidation of single-carbon molecules on NSPd through the lattice oxygen, and the activation of an oxidation-reduction cycle between the high and low chemical valences of cerium, leading to improve the electrocatalytic efficiency of NSPd. Finally, it is confirmed the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde, and then to formic acid during electrooxidation by using cyclic voltammetry studies.

Although carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content in digested vinasse was two times less than in the normal vinasse (part of the N was lost during filtration and used by cellular synthesis of reactor biomass), N2O emissions were four-fold higher in the treatment with digested vinasse plus urea (302.8 mg N-N2O m(-2)) than in the treatment with normal vinasse amended with urea (70.9 mg N-N2O m(-2)). Differently from all the other treatments, digested vinasse alone resulted in positive emissions of CH4 center dot CO2 emissions follow vinasse in natura > vinasse in natura + urea > digested vinasse + urea > urea > control > digested vinasse, contradicting again the paradigm of C availability and N2O emissions. Many efforts have been made to describe models with an input of nutrients, their availability and N20 release. It can be concluded that the amount of nutrients is not sufficient and microbiological factors may contribute to improve GHG emission estimates.

J	Vilakazi, BS; Zengeni, R; Mafongoya, P				Vilakazi, Bonginkosi S.; Zengeni, Rebecca; Mafongoya, Paramu			Selected Soil Physicochemical Properties under Different Tillage Practices and N Fertilizer Application in Maize Mono-Cropping	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												No-till (NT) has been said to conserve soil moisture, maintain or increase organic matter (OM), and improve crop production compared to conventional tillage (CT). However, very few studies have explored the effect of these under dry-land agriculture with occasional tillage where ploughing is performed only after several years of NT, especially in KwaZulu-Natal. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tillage and fertilizer application on selected physicochemical soil properties under rain-fed maize production. Soil samples from NT, conventional tillage in the 5th season (CT-Y5), and annual conventional tillage (CT-A) with 0, 60, 120, 240 kg N ha(-1) were taken at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm and analysed for pH, EC, exchangeable acidity, exchangeable bases, C:N, gravimetric water content, bulk density, and soil texture. Results showed that NT at 0 and 60 kg N ha(-1) in 0-10 cm had higher bases, gravimetric water content, pH, and EC compared CT-Y5 and CT-A (p < 0.05). At 10-20 cm depth, CT-Y5 had higher gravimetric water content (0.17 gg(-1)), followed by CT-A, (0.13 g g(-1)), while NT had the least (0.11 g g(-1)) (p < 0.05) in the control treatment. Again at 20-30 cm depth, NT had higher (p < 0.05) bases than CT-Y5 and CT-A tillage practices at 120 and 240 kg N ha(-1) application rate. Regression analysis of fertilizer application rate with both bases and gravimetric water content showed a strong relationship under NT. Better soil properties under both NT and CT-Y5 was attributed to residue cover and minimum disturbance of the soil, which encouraged infiltration, thus reducing runoff and evaporation from the soil surface. Accumulation of residue under conservation tillage enhances OM, which subsequently improves soil quality, whereas ploughing aerates the soil causing oxidation of OM, thus releasing H+ ions. Again, fertilizer application induces mineralization of OM, thus, higher fertilizer application rates result in low levels of carbon. NT is well-recommended in conserving soil quality while sustaining crop productivity.

XRD, SEM and TEM were employed to characterize the crystal structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples. The results showed that the Cu/Cu2O nanoclusters are homogeneously anchored onto the carbon spheres and the phase composition can be changed by altering the numbers of the assembly layers. The double shelled Cu/Cu2O/CSs showed remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward glucose oxidation including two linear range (10-690 RM and 1190-3690 mu M) with high selectivity of 63.8 and 22.6 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) respectively, as well as good stability and repeatability. More importantly, the interference from the commonly interfering species such as L-valine, urea, L-proline, NaCl and L-lysine can be effectively avoided. All these results indicated this novel nanostructured material might be a promising candidate for non-enzymatic glucose sensors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The pattern of apolipoprotein A-I lysine carbamylation reflects its lipidation state and the chemical environment within human atherosclerotic aorta	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY												Protein lysine carbamylation is an irreversible post translational modification resulting in generation of homocitrulline (N-epsilon-carbamyllysine), which no longer possesses a charged epsilon-amino moiety. Two distinct pathways can promote protein carbamylation. One results from urea decomposition, forming an equilibrium mixture of cyanate (CNO-) and the reactive electrophile isocyanate. The second pathway involves myeloperoxidase (MPO)-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate (SCN-), yielding CNO- and isocyanate. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein constituent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), is a known target for MPO-catalyzed modifi- cation in vivo, converting the cardioprotective lipoprotein into a proatherogenic and proapoptotic one. We hypothesized that monitoring site-specific carbamylation patterns of apoA-I recovered from human atherosclerotic aorta could provide insights into the chemical environment within the artery wall. To test this, we first mapped carbamyllysine obtained from in vitro carbamylation of apoA-I by both the urea-driven (nonenzymatic) and inflammatory-driven (enzymatic) pathways in lipid-poor and lipidated apoA-I (reconstituted HDL). Our results suggest that lysine residues within proximity of the known MPO-binding sites on HDL are preferentially targeted by the enzymatic (MPO) carbamylation pathway, whereas the nonenzymatic pathway leads to nearly uniform distribution of carbamylated lysine residues along the apoA-I polypeptide chain. Quantitative proteomic analyses of apoA-I from human aortic atheroma identified 16 of the 21 lysine residues as carbamylated and suggested that the majority of apoA-I carbamylation in vivo occurs on "lipid-poor " apoA-I forms via the nonenzymatic CNO- pathway. Monitoring patterns of apoA-I carbamylation recovered from arterial tissues can provide insights into both apoA-I structure and the chemical environment within human atheroma.

Mice were chosen and randomly divided into RO group, D25 group, D100 group, D300 group and D600 group with 20 mice for each group. The mice of the control group, RO group were fed with the 15 ml/kg common fresh water reverse osmosis water by gavage; 15 ml/kg ocean water of four different kinds of hardness were given to the 4 experimental groups by gavage. The experiment lasted for 30 days. Mice loaded swimming time, hepatic glycogen reserve, serum urea nitrogen after swimming and changes in blood lactic acid content before and after swimming were observed. The ocean water obviously prolongs mice swimming time (P < 0.05); ocean water can lower post-exercise mice serum lactic acid level and the difference is significant (P < 0.05); ocean water mice hepatic glycogen reserve is higher than that of the RO group (P < 0.05). After swimming, the serum urea content mice of ocean water group is obviously lower than that of RO group (P < 0.05). It was concluded that the ocean water can postpone the occurrence of body sports fatigue and enhance the body exercise tolerance.																			0209-4541						2016	39	2					1361	1373																WOS:000381320400011

An efficient fertilizer management practice and selection of appropriate crop cultivars could play a crucial role in improving yield and promoting low-carbon agriculture across saline soils. A two-year multi-location field experiment was conducted during the Boro (dry) season (December-April) to investigate the effects of fertilizer management and rice cultivar selection on rice yield, economic viability, and global warming potential (GWP) in coastal saline soils of Bangladesh. The study included seven fertilizer treatments with varying nitrogen rates and sources, as well as two rice cultivars (BRRI dhan67 and BRRI dhan88). The results showed that integrated nutrient management-2 (INM-2) significantly (p < 0.05) increased rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency compared to other treatments for both BRRI dhan67 and BRRI dhan88. Similarly, INM-2 gave a higher return on fertilizer investment and marginal benefit-cost ratio than other treatments in both locations and under both cultivars.

Both the surfaces and the etching products were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods. Analysis of surfaces before and after NHC treatment by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the complete removal of copper(II) oxide. By using(13)C-labelling, we determined that the products of this transformation include a cyclic urea, a ring-opened formamide and a bis-carbene copper(I) complex. These results illustrate the potential of NHCs to functionalize a much broader class of metals, including those prone to oxidation, greatly facilitating the preparation of NHC-based films on metals other than gold.

The catalyst characterization results reveal that two factors accounted for this phenomenon. The first factor is that more negatively charged metallic Pt nanoparticles were obtained during the liquid phase NaBH4 reduction treatment preparation process and the second factor is that more Au+ species were formed using urea as the precipitant in the Au deposition-precipitation. The larger number of negatively charged metallic Pt nanoparticles and Au+ species resulted in abundant chemisorbed oxygen, which contributed to the co-oxidation of HCHO and CO. In addition, water exhibited a negative effect on the simultaneous removal of CO and HCHO. Based upon these results, a possible mechanism for the simultaneous removal of CO and HCHO at room temperature is also proposed.

Neuroprotective agents refer to substances that are capable of preserving brain function and structure. Currently, there are no neuroprotective agents available that can effectively relieve the progression of Parkinson's disease. In this work, five novel 4-aminopyridine derivatives, including three amides and two ureas, were designed, synthesized, and evaluated using the rat PC12 mice pheochromocytoma cell line as an in vitro model. As well as human Rho kinase inhibitory experiment was performed. Among them, compound 3, which exhibited high cell viability, low cytotoxicity and good efficacy of inhibition on alpha-synuclein, oxidation, inflammation and Rho kinase, was profound as potential agents for Parkinson's disease (PD).

This work reveals the synergetic effect of the structure and morphology in reducing capacity fade and improving rate capability in Li1.2Mn0.52Ni0.13Co0.13Al0.02O2 (LMNCA) cathode. The results show that the hybrid microwave irradiation-combustion synthesis results in smaller particles, increased lattice parameters, reduced transition metal oxidation states, and high Li-ion diffusion coefficients.

Urea/SCR, selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 generated through urea decomposition, is commonly regarded as the best way to reduce NOx in low temperature lean exhaust. However, the urea/SCR system has inherent drawbacks, i.e., periodic refill of the aqueous urea solution and a complicated hardware system. Here, we demonstrated a state-of-the-art catalyst that is extremely selective and efficient for reducing NOx, primarily with the most abundant reductant, CO, particularly in the presence of O-2 (>5%) at low temperature. Under temperatures lower than 250 degrees C, IrRu/Al2O3 catalysts achieved higher NOx conversion by CO only than a commercial Cu-based urea/SCR catalyst employing NH3 as a primary reductant. Furthermore, the IrRu catalyst revealed high thermal stability and SO2 tolerance, which are very important factors for real world applications.

The Rh-xantphos complex, dissolved in [EMIM][NTf2] and dispersed onto commercially available activated carbon yielded low activity. The incorporation of nitrogen functionalities into the surface was achieved via oxidation of the original carbon support followed by reduction with either urea or ammonia. SILP catalysts based on the so-obtained NDC materials provided higher activity in ethylene hydroformylation, while at the same time the formation of undesired aldol condensation products was low. Thus, the performance of the new SILP catalyst on NDC material represents a significant step ahead for a technically relevant, continuous catalytic operation with very high aldehyde selectivity.

Optical and electrochemical tuning of hydrothermally synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon dots	NANOSCALE ADVANCES												Carbon dots (CDs) are a rapidly progressing class of nanomaterial which show promise towards applications in solar energy conversion due to their low toxicity, favorable electrochemical properties, and tunability. In recent years there have been a number of reported CD syntheses, both top-down and bottom-up methods, producing a diverse range of CDs with intrinsic properties dependent on the starting materials and utilized dopants. This work presents a citrate buffer-facilitated synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCD) and explores the impact of urea concentration on observed electrochemical and optical properties. Optical absorbance and quantum yield of NCDs were found to increase with the dopant concentrations present in the hydrothermal reaction mixture. Electrochemical analysis demonstrates that increased nitrogen content results in the shifting of carbon dot oxidation potentials without the need of post-synthesis surface modifications. Over the range of molar ratios of dopant-to-citrate tested, the oxidation potentials of NCDs shifted up to 150 mV towards more negative potentials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the addition of pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen at different levels in different batches of NCDs, which are likely the source of the observed changes.

Oxidized sucrose (OS) was prepared by partial oxidation with sodium periodate. The OS was used as a hydrophilic cross-linking agent instead of conventional anti-crease agents. The chemical structure of the OS characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and aldehyde groups were found in the OS. The effects of OS mass concentration, catalyst mass concentration, pH, curing temperature and curing time on the crease recovery angle (CRA), whiteness index (WI) and strong retention rate (TS %) of fabrics were studied. The optimal finishing process was an OS mass concentration of 150 g/L, a catalyst mass concentration of 20 g/L, pH 3 and curing for 3 min at160 degrees C. The OS-treated cotton fabrics could obtain a maximum CRA of 245 degrees, WI of 82.8 and TS% of 65%. Compared with DMDHEU, glutaraldehyde, BTCA and CA finishing fabrics, the OS finishing fabric had a shorter wetting time of 5.01 s and a higher water retention.

However, the production of thermally stable CDs still remains a significant challenge as it requires a stable structure resistant to thermal oxidation and effective control of aggregation sites. Herein, we have developed a strategy for producing fluorescent nano-CDs with a stable structure and high thermal resistance properties using citrazinic acid and urea via solid-state carbonization. These nano-CDs exhibit excellent performance at high temperatures ranging from 10 to 90 C-degrees. The core structure of nano-CDs is functionalized with various C=O/C=N nitrogen and oxygen groups, which enhance the structural integrity of the fluorescent nano-CDs and protect them against thermal oxidation and the aggregation effect. The thermal stability of the nano-CDs was evaluated using state-of-the-art techniques such as photoluminescent spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and decay lifetime measurements. Besides thermal resistance, nano-CDs exhibit green light emission with a maximum excitation of 400 nm and a peak quantum yield of 7.8%.

Electrochemical Determination of Fentanyl Using Carbon Nanofiber-Modified Electrodes	ACS OMEGA												In this work, we report the direct electrochemical oxidation of fentanyl using commercial screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) modified with carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanofibers (fCNFs). CNFs have surface chemistry and reactivity similar to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), yet they are easier to produce and are of a lower cost than CNTs. By monitoring the current produced during the electrochemical oxidation of fentanyl, variables such as fCNF loading, fentanyl accumulation time, electrolyte pH, and differential pulse voltammetry parameters were optimized. Under an optimized set of conditions, the fCNF/SPCEs responded linearly to fentanyl in the concentration range of 0.125-10 mu M, with a limit of detection of 75 nM. The fCNF/SPCEs also demonstrated excellent selectivity against common cutting agents found in illicit drugs (e.g., glucose, sucrose, caffeine, acetaminophen, and theophylline) and interferents found in biological samples (e.g., ascorbic acid, NaCl, urea, creatinine, and uric acid). The performance of the sensor was also successfully tested using fentanyl spiked into an artificial urine sample. The straightforward electrode assembly process, low cost, ease of use, and rapid response make the fCNF/SPCEs prime candidates for the detection of fentanyl in both physiological samples and street drugs.

The mechanism of oxidation of chlorogenic acid was examined using cyclic voltammetry, indicating a reversible two-electron process. Compared with the bare carbon paste electrode (CPE), the oxidation signals of chlorogenic acid were greatly enhanced with the alumina micro fiber-modified CPE. Chronocoulometry experiments indicated that the accumulation of chlorogenic acid on the surface of the alumina microfibers was obviously improved relative to that on the bare electrode, which is attributed to the numerous micropores and regular fiber-like structures. Based on the signal amplification ability of the porous alumina microfibers, a novel electrochemical sensing platform was developed for chlorogenic acid. The linear range was 10-2000 mu g L-1, and the limit of detection was evaluated to be 5.0 mu g L-1. The practical application of this new method was demonstrated using honeysuckle and soft drink samples. The results were consistent with the values obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography.																			0026-265X	1095-9149				MAR	2019	145						801	805		10.1016/j.microc.2018.11.055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2018.11.055													WOS:000457513000103

The thermal stability, degradation performance and structure-activity relationship of these catalysts for eliminating C6H5CH3 and C6H5Cl mixed pollutants were evaluated. The results indicated that with the increase of ZrO2 content, the catalytic activity of CeNbxZrO increased first and then decreased. Among them, the CeNb3.3ZrO catalyst (Ce/Nb/Zr=2/1/3.3, molar ratio) exhibited the highest catalytic activity (C6H5CH3: T 90 % =310 degrees C, C6H5Cl: T 90 % =344 degrees C) and thermal stability. Compared with the traditional CeO2-MnO2 catalyst, the T 90 % of the CeNb3.3ZrO catalyst in the degradation of C6H5Cl was reduced by 100 degrees C. CeNb3.3ZrO exhibited high specific surface area and strong oxidation ability, which enhanced the redox cycles and promoted the interactions between metal ions. In addition, the formation of Ce2Zr3O10 solid solution made its structure stable even at high temperature. Overall, the optimized CeNb3.3ZrO has broad prospects in the catalytic treatment of volatile organic compounds and some other related fields in thermal catalysis.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				DEC 5	2024	480								136318	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136318		OCT 2024						39471611					WOS:001347194400001

Retrofitting SCR system to the diesel engines and, enhancing the catalyst activity along with injection controller of this system has become necessary because of stringent emission standards. In this work, dual catalyst is used to increase catalytic activity and, controlled urea injection is applied to decrease the slip of SCR system for stationary diesel engine. First, a pair of ceramic monolith substrate is selected and, coated with cerium oxide and Cu-zeolite for oxidation and SCR catalyst, respectively. XRD, BET and TGA-DSC are used to analyze the structural, and electrochemical behavior of the synthesized catalyst. The morphology and element composition of dual catalyst coated over the substrates are studied using FE-SEM and XEDS. Second, the thermocouple and rotary encoder are used to control the injector of SCR system, which injects the urea when the burned NOx leaves the engine exhaust manifold and enters the SCR. Finally, the diesel engine performance indicators and emission reduction due to the SCR system are evaluated under Non Road Steady Cycle (NRSC). From the experimental results, it is observed that the combined action of catalyst provides wide operating range between 153 and 425 degrees C and, controlled urea injection at 220 degrees of exhaust valve opening with rate of 24.44 ms per cycle achieved a high De-NOx conversion efficiency of 93.4 % for SCR system, with a marginal reduction in engine Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) at maximum Brake Power (BP) condition. Thus, diesel engine exhaust retrofitted with SCR system proposed in this work will meet the Euro-VI emission standards.

In this study, field experiments were conducted to explore As uptake in rice and As translation and distribution in As-contaminated iron-rich paddy soils after applying different forms of N fertilizers, including urea (CO(NH2)(2)), ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), nitrate of potash (KNO3), and ammonium bicarbonate + nitrate of potash (NH4HCO3 + KNO3). The results indicated that applying nitrate N fertilizer inhibited the reduction and dissolution of As-bearing iron minerals and promoted microbial-mediated As(III) oxidation in flooded soil, thus reducing the soil As bio-availability. The concentrations of total As and inorganic As ratio (iAs/TAs) in rice grain decreased by 32.4% and 15.4%, respectively. However, the application of ammonium nitrogen promoted the reductive dissolution of As-bearing iron minerals and stimulated microbial As(V) reduction in flooded soil, leading to the release of As from soil to porewater. The total As concentration and inorganic As uptake ratio in rice grain increased by 20.1 % and 6.2 %, respectively, when urea was applied, and by 29.6% and 10.5%, respectively, when ammonium bicarbonate was applied. However, the simultaneous application of NH4+ and NO3- had no significant effect on As concentration in rice grain and its transformation in paddy soils. Ammonium nitrogen enhanced the organic As concentration in rice grain because the increased As(III) promoted As methylation in soil. In contrast, nitrate decreased the organic As uptake by rice grain because the decreased As(III) diminished As methylation in soil. The results provide reasonable N fertilization strategies for regulating the As biogeochemical process and reducing the risk of As contamination in rice.

Under acidic conditions, the primary carbon-containing product is cyanamide, not urea as considered previously for many oxidation reactions of thiourea dioxide. Increase of the rate of the reaction by an increase of pH can be readily explained by the slow pH-dependent formation of a more reactive form of thiourea dioxide (TDO) that is produced steadily and unavoidably as the stock TDO solution ages. We have also found that the absorbance-time profiles of the chlorine dioxide-TDO reaction are sigmoidal with excess TDO. The addition of methionine as a hypochlorous acid scavenging agent inhibits the reaction significantly, whereas the addition of chlorite ions and trace amounts of hydrogen sulfite ions accelerates the decay of chlorine dioxide. On the basis of these experiments, a sixteen-step kinetic model involving hypochlorous acid, chlorite ions, and hydrogen sulfite ions as key intermediates that provide an autocatalytic cycle is proposed to account for the overall kinetic behavior observed, including the slow rearrangement of TDO.

However, developing solid amine adsorbents that concurrently exhibit high oxidative stability and superior CO2 adsorption capacity remains a significant challenge. Here, ED-PEI/PEG@FS-TBP, an innovative and highly stable CO2 adsorbent is introduced. This material involves the functionalization of polyethyleneimine (PEI) with 1,2-epoxydodecane (ED), effectively transforming primary amines into secondary amines, thereby mitigating urea formation. Furthermore, the chelator embedded within the fumed silica (FS) supports sequestering metallic impurities that would otherwise catalyze oxidation reactions. The integration of polyethylene glycol (PEG) forms hydrogen bonds with PEI, effectively barricading oxygen access and safeguarding against PEI oxidation. ED-PEI/PEG@FS-TBP achieves an outstanding CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.49 mmol g(-1) at 298 K and 0.0004 bar. Notably, after 20 days of oxidative aging in an environment with 75% relative humidity and 383 K, ED-PEI/PEG@FS-TBP exhibits remarkable oxidative stability, with a deactivation rate constant (k(deact)) 93% lower than that of PEI@FS. Its excellent oxidative stability, cycling stability, and high thermal stability, underscore its unparalleled potential for the capture of low-concentration CO2.

Optimization by multivariate analysis	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Arsenic (III) is a common by product of mining activity. This contaminant can have a high environmental impact because it might accumulate in the food chain and seriously affect human health. The purpose of this study is to develop a method to remove arsenic (III) using the photo catalyst TiO2-N activated by visible light. The catalyst TiO2 Degussa P-25 was doped with nitrogen in order to narrow the energy gap and to work with radiation in the visible range. A multi variable approach was used in order to optimize the removal of arsenic, varying the concentration of the catalyst and the pH, maintaining the initial concentration of As (III) in 3 mg L-1. Two optima were determined, in one of which As (III) was reduced by 96.7% at pH 2, and in the other As was reduced by 80% at pH 7. Furthermore, the toxicity of the As (III) solutions was determined using Daphnia magna before and after the photochemical treatment. Mortality in the initial concentration was 87%. After the treatment at pH 2.0, a significant reduction in toxicity was recorded, with a mortality of only 30%.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibition generates the reactive oxygen species and induces oxidative stress, which ultimately results in cellular damage like in the kidney. Examining blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, creatinine, and kidney histopathology is an appropriate indicator to assess the toxicity of chlorpyrifos to the degree of damage to cells and kidney tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research used to determine the effect of duration of exposure to chlorpyrifos and dose-response relationships is important for early detection of the effects of chlorpyrifos toxicity on health. The research study was a true experimental (completely randomized design) consisting of 30 subjects divided into 5 groups. Controlled Group (K1) given 1 mg/kg BW Tween 20 and NaCl 0, 9% until the 56(th) day. The chlorpyrifos exposed group (P1, P2, P3, and P4) was given chlorpyrifos 5 mg/kg BW for 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. After the treatment, BUN and creatinine levels were measured, and microscopic changes in the kidney were analyzed. The results of BUN, creatinine, and kidney histopathologic were analyzed using the analysis of variance statistical test. RESULTS: The data result showed that compared to the control group, there were significant increases of BUN and creatinine (P = 0.013 and P = 0.003). Histopathological examinations of kidney glomerulus diameter were also smaller compared to the control group (P = 0.00). All the data measurement indicates significant differences compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that sub-chronic oral exposure to chlorpyrifos at low doses can damage the kidneys and cause kidney failure.

However, little was known about IMD degradation via abiotic pathways, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-based oxidation processes. Here we systematically investigated the mechanism of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) production and the associated IMD degradation in the goethite (alpha-FeOOH)-based Fenton-like systems. Results showed that IMD can be efficiently degraded in the alpha-FeOOH/H2O2 systems, with degradation rate exceeded 80% within 48 h. Based on the examination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and chemical probes, (OH)-O-center dot was identified as the key ROS that responsible for IMD degradation. IMD can be decomposed via hydroxylation or removal of -N-NO2 to produce hydroxylated IMD, cyclic urea and 6-chloronicotinic acid, with the associated toxicities also evaluated. In addition, the increasing H2O2 concentration and decreasing solution pH both significantly increased IMD degradation. This study provides theoretical understanding for the implications of soil mineral-based Fenton-like reactions in the abiotic transformation of pesticide pollutants.

In the present work, we have fabricated a promising bifunctional thin film-based catalyst for hydrogen generation with concurrent wastewater treatment. The prepared catalyst film is a vertically oriented thin SnS (tin monosulfide) nanosheet array on a Ni-foam (SnS/NF) obtained via a solution process, demonstrating a promising electrocatalytic activity towards the generation of green H-2 fuel at the cathodic side and the decomposition of urea waste at the anodic side. Notably, while assembling two identical electrodes as cathode and anode together with a reference electrode (i.e., SnS/NF parallel to SnS/NF vs. RHE assembly) in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte containing 0.33 M urea, the electrolyzer electrolyzed urea at a lower cell potential of 1.37 and 1.43 V (vs. RHE) to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, for the decomposition of urea at the anodic SnS/NF electrode and green hydrogen fuel generation at the cathodic SnS/NF electrode. This activity on electrocatalytic urea decomposition lies within the best performance to those of the previously reported sulfide-based and other catalytic materials. The promising catalytic activities of the SnS catalyst film are attributed to its combined effect of self-standing nanosheet array morphology and high crystallinity, which provides abundant active sites and a facile charge transfer path between the nanosheet arrays and the electrolyte. Thus, the present work offers a green avenue to the waste-urea treatment in water and sustainable hydrogen energy production.

OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY												There is a dire need to discover new targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development. Decreased neuronal glucose metabolism that occurs in AD brain could play a central role in disease progression. Little is known about the compensatory neuronal changes that occur to attempt to maintain energy homeostasis. In this review using the PubMed literature database, we summarize evidence that amino acid oxidation can temporarily compensate for the decreased glucose metabolism, but eventually altered amino acid and amino acid catabolite levels likely lead to toxicities contributing to AD progression. Because amino acids are involved in so many cellular metabolic and signaling pathways, the effects of altered amino acid metabolism in AD brain are far-reaching. Possible pathological results from changes in the levels of several important amino acids are discussed. Urea cycle function may be induced in endothelial cells of AD patient brains, possibly to remove excess ammonia produced from increased amino acid catabolism. Studying AD from a metabolic perspective provides new insights into AD pathogenesis and may lead to the discovery of dietary metabolite supplements that can partially compensate for alterations of enzymatic function to delay AD or alleviate some of the suffering caused by the disease.

The evolution of the surface of the mineral schreibersite in prebiotic chemistry	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												We present a study of the reactions of the meteoritic mineral schreibersite (Fe, Ni)(3)P, focusing primarily on surface chemistry and prebiotic phosphorylation. In this work, a synthetic analogue of the mineral was synthesized by mixing stoichiometric proportions of elemental iron, nickel and phosphorus and heating in a tube furnace at 820 degrees C for approximately 235 hours under argon or under vacuum, a modification of the method of Skala and Drabek (2002). Once synthesized, the schreibersite was characterized to confirm the identity of the product as well as to elucidate the oxidation processes affecting the surface. In addition to characterization of the solid product, this schreibersite was reacted with water or with organic solutes in a choline chloride-urea deep eutectic mixture, to constrain potential prebiotic products. Major inorganic solutes produced by reaction of water include orthophosphate, phosphite, pyrophosphate and hypophosphate consistent with prior work on Fe3P corrosion. Additionally, schreibersite corrodes in water and dries down to form a deep eutectic solution, generating phosphorylated products, in this case phosphocholine, using this synthesized schreibersite.

J	Roselin, LS; Chiu, HW				Roselin, L. Selva; Chiu, Hsiao-Wen			Production of hydrogen by oxidative steam reforming of methanol over Cu/SiO2 catalysts	JOURNAL OF SAUDI CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Selective production of hydrogen by oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM) was studied over Cu/SiO2 catalyst using fixed bed flow reactor. Textural and structural properties of the catalyst were analyzed by various instrumental methods. TPR analysis illustrates that the reduction temperature peak was observed between 510 K and 532 K at various copper loadings and calcination temperatures and the peaks shifted to higher temperature with increasing copper loading and calcination temperature. The XRD and XPS analysis demonstrates that the copper existed in different oxidation states at different conditions: Cu2O, Cu-0, CuO and Cu(OH)(2) in uncalcined sample; CuO in calcined sample: Cu2O and metallic Cu after reduction at 600 K and Cu-0 and CuO after catalytic test. TEM analysis reveals that at various copper loadings, the copper particle size is in the range between 3.0 nm and 3.8 nm. The Cu particle size after catalytic test increased from 3.6 to 4.8 nm, which is due to the formation of oxides of copper as evidenced from XRD and XPS analysis. The catalytic performance at various Cu loadings shows that with increasing Cu loading from 4.7 to 17.3 wt%, the activity increases and thereafter it decreases. Effect of calcination shows that the sample calcined at 673 K exhibited high activity. The O-2/CH3 OH and H2O/CH3OH molar ratios play important role in reaction rate and product distribution. The optimum molar ratios of O-2/CH3OH and H2O/CH3OH are 0.25 and 0.1, respectively. When the reaction temperature varied from 473 to 548 K, the methanol conversion and H-2 production rate are in the range of 21.9-97.5% and 1.2-300.9 mmol kg(-1) s(-1), respectively. The CO selectivity is negligible at these temperatures. Under the optimum conditions (17.3 wt%, Cu/SiO2; calcination temperature 673 K; 0.25 O-2/CH3OH molar ratio, 0.5 H2O/CH3OH molar ratio and reaction temperature 548 K), the maximum hydrogen yield obtained was 2.45 mol of hydrogen per mole of methanol.

J	Wu, H; Huo, YX				Wu, Hao; Huo, Yaoxing			One step synthesis of efficient photocatalysts by TCAP doped g-C3N4 for enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												This paper describes a simple one-pot method for the synthesis of a new non-metal-doped graphite carbon nitride (CN/TCAP) by thermal condensation of 2-amino-1,1,3-tricyano-1-propene (TCAP) and urea. A small amount of TCAP is added into urea as a precursor during thermal polymerization. The material retains the original structure of g-C3N4, exhibits significantly enhanced visible light capture, and promotes the separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers. The CN/TCAP-100 catalyst degrades 10 mg L-1 Orange II (OR-II) in 60 min at a photocatalytic rate of 0.038 min(-1), which is almost 6.55 times the photocatalytic rate of pure g-C3N4. The CN/TCAP-X has a high visible light-driven oxidation activity due to its porous morphology and unique electrical structure. The porous structure of CN/TCAP-X provides more active sites for the adsorption and degradation of contaminants. In addition, the copolymerization of TCAP helps extend the range of light absorption to 561 nm, improve the separation of charge carriers, and change the position of the conduction and valence bands. The edge of the valence band moves from 1.94 eV to 1.78 eV due to the doping of TCAP. Trapping experiments showed that superoxide radicals play a major role in the photocatalytic degradation of OR-II on CN/TCAP-100.																			1144-0546	1369-9261				JAN 21	2020	44	3					1127	1137		10.1039/c9nj05270d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9nj05270d													WOS:000509327200052

Dependence of the textural properties and surface species of ZnO photocatalytic materials on the type of precipitating agent used in the hydrothermal synthesis	BULLETIN OF MATERIALS SCIENCE												Three different precipitating agents (NaOH, and ) have been applied for the hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO powder materials, aiming at obtaining various types of porosity and surface species on ZnO. The synthesis procedures were carried out in the presence and in the absence of tri-block copolymer Pluronic (P123, EO20PO70EO20). These materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), BET method and TG-differential thermal analysis (DTA) method, and their photocatalytic activities were tested in the removal azo dye Reactive Black 5 (RB5). The urea precipitant yields spongy-like surface forms and the greatest share of mesopores. It has the highest specific surface area, highest degree of crystallinity of wurtzite ZnO phase and largest content of surface OH groups in comparison with the other two precipitants. The zinc hydroxycarbonate intermediate phase is missing in the case of NaOH as precipitating agent; therefore, it manifests poorer textural characteristics. The morphology of P123-modified sample is different and consists of needle-shaped particles. The urea-precipitated samples display superior performance in the photocatalytic oxidation reaction, compared with the other precipitated samples. The other two precipitating agents are inferior in regard to their photocatalytic activity due to greater share of micropores (not well-illuminated inner surface) and different surface morphologies.

The spherical composite showed a particle size of approximately 4 mu m with NiFe-LDHs sheets that were closely arranged on the sphere surfaces. The formation mechanism of the composite was inferred. First, Ni-II and Fe-III ions were adsorbed on the CNT surface. Simultaneously, the CNT agglomerated into interwoven clusters to form a conductive network. Sequential hydrolysis and polycondensation of Fe-III in the presence of urea were kinetically beneficial to the precipitation of amorphous iron hydroxide. Then, an in situ phase transition from amorphous iron hydroxide to alpha-FeOOH/Fe(OH)(3) nanoflakes occurred. Surface-adsorbed Ni-II was doped into the alpha-FeOOH/Fe(OH)(3) flakes. Finally, the NiFe-LDHs nanoflakes continued to crystallize and formed a NiFe-LDHs/CNT spherical composite. Compared to the NiFe-LDHs powder sample, the NiFe-LDHs/CNT composite had enhanced electrocatalytic activity (approximately 5 times), showed a smaller electron transfer resistance of 15.7 Omega, and increased the long-term stability of ethanol oxidation, which could be deduced from the synergistic effect between NiFeLDHs and CNT.					xianggui, kong/MAI-5631-2025; Lei, Xiaodong/G-2661-2012														0169-1317	1872-9053				MAR 1	2021	202								105964	10.1016/j.clay.2020.105964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clay.2020.105964		JAN 2021											WOS:000624975100004

Despite the progress made by research groups in developing rechargeable Al//MxOy (M = Mn, V, etc.) cells using an aqueous Al trifluoromethanesulfonate-based electrolyte, the reactions occurring at the Al anode are still not fully understood. In this study, we explore the artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) on the Al anode by soaking it in AlCl3/urea ionic liquid. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that the ASEI actually promotes the corrosion of Al by providing chloride anions rather than facilitating the transport of Al3+ ions during charge/discharge cycles. Importantly, the ASEI significantly enhances the cycling stability and activity of Al cells. The primary reactions occurring at the Al anode during the charge/discharge cycle were determined to be irreversible oxidation and gas evolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate the successful realization of urea-treated Al (UTAl)//AlxMnO2 cells (discharge operating voltage of similar to 1.45 V and specific capacity of 280 mAh/g), providing a platform to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these cells further. Overall, our work highlights the importance of ASEI in controlling the corrosion of Al in aqueous electrolytes, emphasizing the need for the further development of electrolytic materials that facilitate the transport of Al3+ ions in rechargeable Al batteries.

During the past several years, significant advances have been made in the direct applications of pristine 2D MOF nanosheets as efficient electrocatalysts. This review first discusses the synthetic strategies of MOF nanosheets. Then recent progress on pristine MOF nanosheets for electrocatalytic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is summarized. In particular, engineering electronic structures of pristine MOF nanosheets to favor efficient electrocatalytic processes are discussed. Despite the encouraging accomplishments achieved, more engineered pristine MOF nanosheets with enhanced electrocatalytic performance are still needed. Therefore, bottlenecks faced by current pristine MOF nanosheets for electrocatalysis and potential solutions to these problems are finally proposed to promote further development in this research field.

Cardiac microRNA expression profile in response to estivation	BIOCHIMIE												Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) spends most of the year underground in a hypometabolic state known as estivation. During this time, they overcome significant dehydration and lack of food through many mechanisms including employing metabolic rate depression (MRD), increasing urea concentration, switching to lipid oxidation as the primary energy source, and decreasing their breathing and heart rate. MicroRNA (miRNA) are known to regulate translation by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) for degradation or temporary storage, with several studies having reported that miRNA is differentially expressed during MRD, including estivation. Thus, we hypothesized that miRNA would be involved in gene regulation during estivation in S. couchii heart. Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were used to assess changes in miRNA expression in response to two-month estivation and to predict the downstream effects of this expression. KEGG and GO analyses indicated that ribosome and cardiac muscle contraction are among the pathways predicted to be upregulated, whereas cell signaling and fatty acid metabolism were predicted to be downregulated. Together these results suggest that miRNAs contribute to the regulation of gene expression related to cardiac muscle physiology and energy metabolism during estivation.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

This study investigated the possible protective effect of dietary Arthrospira platensis supplementation against lead acetate-induced kidney injury in adult male rats. Rats were divided into 4 groups: normal rats (control rats), rats treated with spirulina, rats treated with lead (Pb) (0.344 g/kg body weight), and rats treated with Pb and spirulina. The exposure of rats to Pb for 30 days provoked renal damage with significant increases in hematological parameters, oxidative stress-related parameters (i.e., thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein carbonyl content, advanced oxidation protein products, and hydrogen peroxide), creatinine and urea levels in plasma, and uric acid level in urine. Conversely, antioxidant enzyme activities (i.e., catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) and levels of nonprotein thiols, plasma uric acid, and urinary creatinine and urea decreased. The administration of spirulina to Pb-treated rats significantly improved weight, peripheral blood parameters, oxidative stress-related parameters, renal biomarker levels, and antioxidant enzyme activities. Also, rats treated with Pb and spirulina had normal kidney histology. These healing effects are likely the result of the high phenol content and significant antioxidant capacity of A. platensis. Our data strongly suggest that spirulina supplementation improves kidney function and plays an important role in the prevention of complications of Pb intoxication.					elfeki, abdelfattah/LKL-6561-2024; magne, christian/AAD-6357-2021	GARGOURI, Manel/0000-0002-1803-3308; elfeki, abdelfattah/0009-0009-9949-1367													1715-5312	1715-5320				MAR	2019	44	3					271	281		10.1139/apnm-2018-0428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2018-0428								30138569					WOS:000459333600006

Effect of statin treatment on metabolites, lipids and prostanoids in patients with Statin Associated Muscle Symptoms (SAMS)	PLOS ONE												BackgroundBetween 5-10% of patients discontinue statin therapy due to statin-associated adverse reactions, primarily statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). The absence of a clear clinical phenotype or of biomarkers poses a challenge for diagnosis and management of SAMS. Similarly, our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of SAMS hinders the identification of treatments for SAMS. Metabolomics, the profiling of metabolites in biofluids, cells and tissues is an important tool for biomarker discovery and provides important insight into the origins of symptomatology. In order to better understand the pathophysiology of this common disorder and to identify biomarkers, we undertook comprehensive metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of plasma samples from patients with SAMS who were undergoing statin rechallenge as part of their clinical care.Methods and findingsWe report our findings in 67 patients, 28 with SAMS (cases) and 39 statin-tolerant controls. SAMS patients were studied during statin rechallenge and statin tolerant controls were studied while on statin. Plasma samples were analyzed using untargeted LC-MS metabolomics and lipidomics to detect differences between cases and controls. Differences in lipid species in plasma were observed between cases and controls. These included higher levels of linoleic acid containing phospholipids and lower ether lipids and sphingolipids. Reduced levels of acylcarnitines and altered amino acid profile (tryptophan, tyrosine, proline, arginine, and taurine) were observed in cases relative to controls. Pathway analysis identified significant increase of urea cycle metabolites and arginine and proline metabolites among cases along with downregulation of pathways mediating oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, carnitine synthesis, and transfer of acetyl groups into mitochondria.ConclusionsThe plasma metabolome of patients with SAMS exhibited reduced content of long chain fatty acids and increased levels of linoleic acid (18:2) in phospholipids, altered energy production pathways (beta-oxidation, citric acid cycle and urea cycles) as well as reduced levels of carnitine, an essential mediator of mitochondrial energy production. Our findings support the hypothesis that alterations in pro-inflammatory lipids (arachidonic acid pathway) and impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism underlie the muscle symptoms of patients with statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS).

After solvent exchange, porous cellulose macrospheres (CMs) with a high specific surface area of 325.3 m(2) g(-1) were obtained by lyophilization, and CuS nanoparticles (CuS NPs) were coated on CMs by in situ growth in the liquid phase to achieve CuS-supported CM macrospheres (CuS@CM). The results indicated that the CuS@CM biocatalyst was successfully prepared with an average diameter of approximately 1.2 mm. In addition, CuS@CM was further used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the catalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) model dyes during the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the presence of low doses of H2O2, the degradation rate of MB reached 94.8% within 10 min, showing high catalytic activity under neutral and alkaline conditions. After five cycles, 90.1% of the original catalytic activity was still retained, indicating that the prepared CuS@CM composite possessed excellent catalytic activity and reusability.

J	Holecek, M				Holecek, Milan			Branched-chain amino acids in health and disease: metabolism, alterations in blood plasma, and as supplements	NUTRITION & METABOLISM												Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) are essential amino acids with protein anabolic properties, which have been studied in a number of muscle wasting disorders for more than 50 years. However, until today, there is no consensus regarding their therapeutic effectiveness. In the article is demonstrated that the crucial roles in BCAA metabolism play: (i) skeletal muscle as the initial site of BCAA catabolism accompanied with the release of alanine and glutamine to the blood; (ii) activity of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD); and (iii) amination of branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) to BCAAs. Enhanced consumption of BCAA for ammonia detoxification to glutamine in muscles is the cause of decreased BCAA levels in liver cirrhosis and urea cycle disorders. Increased BCKD activity is responsible for enhanced oxidation of BCAA in chronic renal failure, trauma, burn, sepsis, cancer, phenylbutyrate-treated subjects, and during exercise. Decreased BCKD activity is the main cause of increased BCAA levels and BCKAs in maple syrup urine disease, and plays a role in increased BCAA levels in diabetes type 2 and obesity. Increased BCAA concentrations during brief starvation and type 1 diabetes are explained by amination of BCKAs in visceral tissues and decreased uptake of BCAA by muscles. The studies indicate beneficial effects of BCAAs and BCKAs in therapy of chronic renal failure. New therapeutic strategies should be developed to enhance effectiveness and avoid adverse effects of BCAA on ammonia production in subjects with liver cirrhosis and urea cycle disorders. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of BCAA supplementation in burn, trauma, sepsis, cancer and exercise. Whether increased BCAA levels only markers are or also contribute to insulin resistance should be known before the decision is taken regarding their suitability in obese subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. It is concluded that alterations in BCAA metabolism have been found common in a number of disease states and careful studies are needed to elucidate their therapeutic effectiveness in most indications.																			1743-7075					MAY 3	2018	15								33	10.1186/s12986-018-0271-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-018-0271-1								29755574					WOS:000431530300001

Lentinula edodes is a highly nutritious mushroom rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. Some studies have demonstrated the hypocholesterolemic effects from L. edodes in high doses, which does not represent the consumption in humans. We evaluated ingestion of a realistic dose of L. edodes associated with a high-fat diet (HFD) on hematologic, biochemical and oxidative stress parameters. Methods Eighteen male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (normal diet); HFD; and HFD + L. edodes (100 mg/kg/day). After 30 days, blood was collected. Biochemical and hematologic parameters were analyzed, as well as oxidative stress biomarkers. Results The HFD increased levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides. Lentinula edodes reduced these parameters significantly to concentrations found in the control group. The HFD increased levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase (markers of liver damage). Lentinula edodes returned the levels of these enzymes to normal levels and normalized serum levels of urea (which were also increased owing to consumption of the HFD). Lentinula edodes reduced levels of urea and glucose. Lipid peroxidation was increased in rats receiving the HFD, and L. edodes reduced malondialdehyde levels, thereby preventing oxidation of fatty acids. Conclusions Lentinula edodes was shown to have hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective and renoprotective features in doses that are suitable for humans.

Triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 were employed as the template agent, urea as the N precursor, NiCl2 as the Ni source and resorcinol-formaldehyde resin as the carbon precursor. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed that nickel particles dispersed in the carbon matrix in forms of metal nickel, in situ catalyzing the graphitization of amorphous carbon.

Redox Potential Correlates with Changes in Metabolite Concentrations Attributable to Pathways Active in Oxidative Stress Response in Swine Traumatic Shock	SHOCK												Introduction: Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, and the redox potential (RP) that must be maintained for proper cell function, lie at the heart of physiologic processes in critical illness. Imbalance in RP reflects systemic oxidative stress, and whole blood RP measures have been shown to correlate with oxygen debt level over time in swine traumatic shock. We hypothesize that RP measures reflect changing concentrations of metabolites involved in oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis, we compared blood and urine RP with concentrations of multiple metabolites in a swine traumatic shock model to identify meaningful RP-metabolite relationships. Methods: Seven swine were subjected to traumatic shock. Mixed venous (MV) RP, urine RP, and concurrent MV and urine metabolite concentrations were assessed at baseline, max O-2 Debt (80 mL/kg), end resuscitation, and 2 h post-resuscitation. RP was measured at collection via open circuit potential using nanoporous gold electrodes with Ag/AgCl reference and a ParstatMC potentiostat. Metabolite concentrations were measured by quantitative H-1-NMR spectroscopy. MV and urine RP were compared with time-matched metabolites across all swine. LASSO regression with leave-one-out cross validation was used to determine meaningful RP/metabolite relationships. Metabolites had to maintain magnitude and direction of coefficients across 6 or more swine to be considered as having a meaningful relationship. KEGG IDs of these metabolites were uploaded into Metscape for pathway identification and evaluation for physiologic function. Results: Meaningful metabolite relationships (and mean coefficients across cross-validation folds) with MV RP included: choline (-6.27), ATP (-4.39), glycine (5.93), ADP (1.84), glucose (15.96), formate (-13.09), pyruvate (6.18), and taurine (-7.18). Relationships with urine RP were: betaine (4.81), urea (4.14), glycine (-2.97), taurine (10.32), 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (-7.67), N-phenylacetylglycine, PAG (-14.52), hippurate (12.89), and formate (-5.89). These meaningful metabolites were found to scavenge extracellular peroxide (pyruvate), inhibit ROS and activate cellular antioxidant defense (taurine), act as indicators of antioxidant mobilization against oxidative stress (glycine + PAG), and reflect renal hydroxyl radical trapping (hippurate), among other activities. Conclusions: Real-time RP measures demonstrate significant relationships with metabolites attributable to metabolic pathways involved in systemic responses to oxidative stress, as well as those involved in these processes. These data support RP measures as a feasible, biologically relevant marker of oxidative stress. As a direct measure of redox state, RP may be a useful biomarker and clinical tool in guiding diagnosis and therapy in states of increased oxidative stress and may offer value as a marker for organ injury in these states as well.

Abnormal levels of glucose can cause diabetes mellitus and related complications. Here, we developed a disposable and portable non-enzymatic glucose sensor strip based on gold-nanoparticles (AuNPs)-modified laser-scribed graphene electrode (LSGE). Disposable LSGEs, with a highly porous structure, were fabricated by laser scribing on a commercially available polyimide plastic sheets, followed by electrodepositing of AuNPs, that are electrocatalytic for glucose oxidation. The laser scribing process was optimised in term of laser power, laser speed and pulse per inch (PPI). The effect of number of the electrochemical deposition cycles of AuNPs on LSGE was also investigated and optimised. The sensor provides a linear detection range for the glucose concentrations between 10 mu M to 10 mM with a limit of detection of 6.3 mu M and shows a good selectivity towards interfering agents, such as urea L-ascorbic acid, uric acid, dopamine, and Nat The LSGE/AuNP strips have a potential to be used as disposable glucose sensor strips for point-of-care glucose measurements, including self-monitoring and nutrition management.

J	Wang, BZ; Zhao, J; Guo, ZY; Ma, J; Xu, H; Jia, ZJ				Wang, Baozhan; Zhao, Jun; Guo, Zhiying; Ma, Jing; Xu, Hua; Jia, Zhongjun			Differential contributions of ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers to nitrification in four paddy soils	ISME JOURNAL												Rice paddy fields are characterized by regular flooding and nitrogen fertilization, but the functional importance of aerobic ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers under unique agricultural management is poorly understood. In this study, we report the differential contributions of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) to nitrification in four paddy soils from different geographic regions (Zi-Yang (ZY), Jiang-Du (JD), Lei-Zhou (LZ) and Jia-Xing (JX)) that are representative of the rice ecosystems in China. In urea-amended microcosms, nitrification activity varied greatly with 11.9, 9.46, 3.03 and 1.43 mu g NO3--Ng(-1) dry weight of soil per day in the ZY, JD, LZ and JX soils, respectively, over the course of a 56-day incubation period. Real-time quantitative PCR of amoA genes and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed significant increases in the AOA population to various extents, suggesting that their relative contributions to ammonia oxidation activity decreased from ZY to JD to LZ. The opposite trend was observed for AOB, and the JX soil stimulated only the AOB populations. DNA-based stable-isotope probing further demonstrated that active AOA numerically outcompeted their bacterial counterparts by 37.0-, 10.5- and 1.91-fold in C-13-DNA from ZY, JD and LZ soils, respectively, whereas AOB, but not AOA, were labeled in the JX soil during active nitrification. NOB were labeled to a much greater extent than AOA and AOB, and the addition of acetylene completely abolished the assimilation of (CO2)-C-13 by nitrifying populations. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that archaeal ammonia oxidation was predominantly catalyzed by soil fosmid 29i4-related AOA within the soil group 1.1b lineage. Nitrosospira cluster 3-like AOB performed most bacterial ammonia oxidation in the ZY, LZ and JX soils, whereas the majority of the C-13-AOB in the JD soil was affiliated with the Nitrosomona communis lineage. The C-13-NOB was overwhelmingly dominated by Nitrospira rather than Nitrobacter. A significant correlation was observed between the active AOA/AOB ratio and the soil oxidation capacity, implying a greater advantage of AOA over AOB under microaerophilic conditions. These results suggest the important roles of soil physiochemical properties in determining the activities of ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers.

Plants rich in CeO2 NPs in water were used as carbon precursors and pyrolyzed with urea to obtain Ce/N co -doped carbon catalysts, which were used in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by active peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The results showed that the Ce/N @BC/PMS system achieved to 94.5% degradation of SMX in 40 min at a rate constant of 0.0602 cm -1. The activation center of PMS is widely dispersed Ce oxide nanocrystals, and CeO2 NPs promote the formation of oxygen centered PFR with enhanced catalytic ability and longer half-life. In addition, N -doping facilitates the transfer of pi-electrons within the sp2 carbon of biochar, increasing active sites and thus improving PMS activation efficiency. The degradation process was contributed to by both radical and non -radical activation mechanisms including 1O2 and direct electron transfer, with O2 center dot- serving as 1O2's precursor. Through the DFT calculations, LC -MS and toxicological analyses, the degradation pathway of pollutants and the toxicity changes throughout the entire degradation process were further revealed, indicating that the degradation of SMX could effectively reduce ecological toxicity.

Its structure and photocatalytic oxidation properties were studied. The results show that the TiO2 particles have a 3D mesoporous structure, uniform distribution and spherical shape, the average diameter is about 0.67 mu m. These properties provide strong light adsorption, high specific surface area, which increases the active site of the photocatalyst, porosity can also enhance the ability of the material to adsorb pollutants, thus has better stability. It was applied to photocatalytic degradation of 10mg/L rhodamine B (RhB) solution. After 80min of irradiation under 420nm ultraviolet (UV) light, the degradation rate of RhB reached more than 90%. In addition, it also provided an excellent photocatalytic efficiency of removing Hg-0 in simulated flue gas. The removal efficiency could still reach over 86% after 40 h, which could be used in the treatment of heavy metal pollutants such as metallurgical flue gas.					xia, yi/KVY-4033-2024; Li, Ziyan/MBG-2345-2025; Koppala, Sivasankar/P-7095-2019	Koppala, Sivasankar/0000-0002-4086-030X													1793-2920	1793-7094				AUG	2021	16	09							2150107	10.1142/S1793292021501071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S1793292021501071													WOS:000702005700010

"Candidatus Subterrananammoxibiaceae," a New Anammox Bacterial Family in Globally Distributed Marine and Terrestrial Subsurfaces	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Microorganisms called anammox bacteria are efficient in removing bioavailable nitrogen from many natural and human-made environments. They exist in almost every anoxic habitat where both ammonium and nitrate/nitrite are present. Bacteria specialized in anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) are widespread in many anoxic habitats and form an important functional guild in the global nitrogen cycle by consuming bio-available nitrogen for energy rather than biomass production. Due to their slow growth rates, cultivation-independent approaches have been used to decipher their diversity across environments. However, their full diversity has not been well recognized. Here, we report a new family of putative anammox bacteria, "Candidatus Subterrananammoxibiaceae," existing in the globally distributed terrestrial and marine subsurface (groundwater and sediments of estuary, deep-sea, and hadal trenches). We recovered a high-quality metagenome-assembled genome of this family, tentatively named "Candidatus Subterrananammoxibius californiae," from a California groundwater site. The "Ca. Subterrananammoxibius californiae" genome not only contains genes for all essential components of anammox metabolism (e.g., hydrazine synthase, hydrazine oxidoreductase, nitrite reductase, and nitrite oxidoreductase) but also has the capacity for urea hydrolysis. In an Arctic ridge sediment core where redox zonation is well resolved, "Ca. Subterrananammoxibiaceae" is confined within the nitrate-ammonium transition zone where the anammox rate maximum occurs, providing environmental proof of the anammox activity of this new family. Phylogenetic analysis of nitrite oxidoreductase suggests that a horizontal transfer facilitated the spreading of the nitrite oxidation capacity between anammox bacteria (in the Planctomycetota phylum) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria from Nitrospirota and Nitrospinota. By recognizing this new anammox family, we propose that all lineages within the "Ca. Brocadiales" order have anammox capacity.IMPORTANCE Microorganisms called anammox bacteria are efficient in removing bioavailable nitrogen from many natural and human-made environments. They exist in almost every anoxic habitat where both ammonium and nitrate/nitrite are present. However, only a few anammox bacteria have been cultured in laboratory settings, and their full phylogenetic diversity has not been recognized. Here, we present a new bacterial family whose members are present across both the terrestrial and marine subsurface. By reconstructing a high-quality genome from the groundwater environment, we demonstrate that this family has all critical enzymes of anammox metabolism and, notably, also urea utilization. This bacterium family in marine sediments is also preferably present in the niche where the anammox process occurs. These findings suggest that this novel family, named "Candidatus Subterrananammoxibiaceae," is an overlooked group of anammox bacteria, which should have impacts on nitrogen cycling in a range of environments.

Oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxide and subsequently sulfone induces an increase in hydrophilicity, resulting in more hydrophilic micellar core. This phase-change caused the micelles to swell and enhance cargo release. Carboxylic acid groups have also been installed onto thioether-containing polycarbonate to promote loading of amine-containing anticancer doxorubicin through electrostatic interaction. Urea-functionalized thioether-containing PEG-block-polycarbonates were synthesized to mix with the acid-functionalized PEG-block-polycarbonate for stabilizing micelle structure through hydrogen-bonding interaction. The mixed micelles were 50 nm in diameter and had a 25 wt% loading capacity for doxorubicin. Enhanced drug release from the micelles was triggered by low pH and high content of ROS.

The effect of the mentioned compounds was investigated through structural (crystallite size, crystal phase composition, etc.), morphological (crystal shape), optical (band gap energy) parameters, surface properties (surface oxidation states), and the resulting photocatalytic activity. It was found that the ratio of the (102)/(110) crystallographic planes, the presence of oxidized Bi4+ and Bi5+ species were responsible for the obtained photocatalytic activity. Moreover, a strong dependency was revealed between the surface tension of the shape tailoring agents and the overall morpho-structural parameters, pointing out the fact that the properties of the semiconductor can be more easily tuned using the surface tension modification as a tool.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of fluoropyrazolesulfonylurea and thiourea derivatives as possible antidiabetic agents	JOURNAL OF ENZYME INHIBITION AND MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY												Fluorinated pyrazoles, benzenesulfonylurea and thiourea and their cyclic sulfonylthiourea derivatives were prepared as hypoglycemic agents. The chemistry involves the condensation of 4-hydrazino benzenesulfonamide hydrochloride with fluorochalcones to give pyrazoline derivatives which upon oxidation with bromine water afforded corresponding pyrazoles. Reaction of pyrazolines with isocyanates and isothiocyanates give the corresponding ureas and thioureas. Subsequent cyclization of these thiourea derivatives with ethyl bromoacetate and alpha-bromoacetophenone yielded the 4-oxothiazolidines and thiazolines, respectively. Preliminary biological screening of the prepared compounds revealed significant antidiabetic activity. Molecular and biological properties calculations revealed favorable drug-like profiles of six compounds.

Aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) plays a decisive role to convert aldoximes into corresponding nitriles. However, natural Oxds commonly exhibit extremely low catalytic capacity toward benzaldehyde oximes. Here, we engineered the OxdF1 from Pseudomonas putida F1 to enhance its catalytic efficiency toward benzaldehyde oximes by a semi-rational design strategy. The protein structure-based CAVER analysis indicates that M29, A147, F306, and L318 are located adjacent to the substrate tunnel entrance of OxdF1, which were responsible for the transportation of substrate into the active site. After two rounds of mutagenesis, the maximum activities of the mutants L318F and L318F/F306Y were 2.6 and 2.8 U/mg respectively, which were significantly higher than the wild OxdF1 of 0.7 U/mg. Meanwhile, the lipase type B from Candida antarctica was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli cells to selectively oxidize benzyl amines to aldoximes using urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct (UHP) as an oxidant in ethyl acetate. To merge the oxidation and dehydration reactions, a reductive extraction solution was added to remove the residue UHP, which is critical to eliminate its inhibition on the Oxd activity. Consequently, nine benzyl amines were efficiently converted into corresponding nitriles by the chemoenzymatic sequence.

The animals were randomly divided into a normal control group, exercise-induced fatigue group (EFG), SSO low-dose group, SSO medium-dose group, and SSO high-dose group. The mice in all the groups underwent swimming training for 10 days. Those in the treatment groups received different amounts of SSO (0.85, 1.68, and 3.35 g/kg BW [body weight]) before the exercise. All the animals were sacrificed on the last day after an exhaustive swimming test, and serum, liver, and brain specimens were collected. In the exhaustive swimming test, the swimming durations in the SSO-treated animals were longer than those in the EFG. Furthermore, SSO reduced serum lactic acid, blood urea nitrogen, and hepatic malondialdehyde levels and increased liver glycogen level, hepatic superoxide dismutase level, hypothalamic dopamine content, and glutathione peroxidase level. The SSO treatment decreased hypothalamic 5-hydroxytryptamine content, lipid hydroperoxide level, NLRP3 inflammasome, and interleukin-1 beta protein expression in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, it promoted the protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in the liver. SSO exhibited an excellent antifatigue effect, which may be related to its inhibition of oxidative and inflammatory injury and regulation of hypothalamic neurotransmitters. Practical ApplicationIn the present study, the effect of sea buckthorn seed oil on fatigue in mice and its potential mechanism were explored. Taken together, the findings provide insight into the potential role of sea buckthorn seed oil in the development of antifatigue drugs.

We report a O-1(2)-responsive micellar nanoplatform subject to considerable size-expansion upon light triggering to facilitate on-demand release of photosensitizers. Imidazole, a well-known O-1(2) scavenger, was incorporated in the hydrophobic core of amphiphilic copolymer micelles, and was used to coordinate with biocompatible Zn2+ and encapsulate the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6). The micelles are highly sensitive to light irradiation: O-1(2) triggering induced dramatic particle size expansion due to the conversion of imidazole to hydrophilic urea, resulting in instantaneous release of Ce6 and rapid intracellular distribution. This O-1(2)-responsive, size-expandable nanosystem delivered substantially more Ce6 to tumor sites as compared to free Ce6, and exhibited improved anti-tumor efficacy in vivo in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice.

The effects of urea/Fe3+ molar ratio, final solvothermal temperature, and residence time on the properties of FeC-S were investigated. Magnetic biochar synthesized through pyrolysis and the chemical co-precipitation method (FeC-P) was employed for comparison. As revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, vibrating sample magnetometer analysis, and Fenton-like oxidation of sulfamethoxazole, the impregnated iron in FeC-S presented as Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an average grain size of 8.9 nm, which makes the material magnetically separable. The FeC-S exhibited a higher Fenton-like catalytic activity than FeC-P, due to the highly dispersed and smaller crystalline size of loaded Fe3O4 particles, as well as the higher amount of oxygen-containing functional groups. The stability test showed that FeC-S can be easily recycled for five subsequent runs without significant activity loss.																			0888-5885					FEB 5	2020	59	5					1809	1821		10.1021/acs.iecr.9b04590	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b04590													WOS:000512223600009

Nitrous oxide production in the Chesapeake Bay	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Estuaries at the global scale are significant but highly uncertain sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), which is an intense greenhouse gas and ozone depletion agent. As the largest estuary in the United States, the Chesapeake Bay is suggested to be a spatially and temporally variable source and sink of N2O. However, limited observations of N2O cycling preclude us from estimating and predicting its net N2O flux. To improve our mechanistic understanding of the processes that control the N2O flux at the point of production, we applied multiple N-15 tracers (NH4+15$$ {}<^>{15}{\mathrm{NH}}_4<^>{+} $$, N-15-urea, NO2-15,$$ {}<^>{15}{\mathrm{NO}}_2<^>{-}, $$ and NO3-15$$ {}<^>{15}{\mathrm{NO}}_3<^>{-} $$) to separately track N2O production from nitrification and denitrification under in situ and manipulated O-2 concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay. Nitrification was the major N2O production pathway in oxic waters (up to 7.5 nmol N2O L-1 d(-1)). In contrast, denitrification dominated N2O production from hypoxic/anoxic waters (up to 20 nmol N2O L-1 d(-1)). N2O production from urea was observed for the first time in estuarine waters. The contribution from urea was small, but interestingly, showed a depth pattern distinct from other N2O precursors. Experimentally lowering the O-2 concentration substantially enhanced N2O production. Therefore, the expansion of hypoxic and anoxic zones in the Chesapeake Bay under climate change as suggested by some climate models may favor the production of N2O, potentially providing positive feedback on warming. Overall, our study provides mechanistic constraints on N2O dynamics that could benefit modeling studies to better estimate the N2O flux in the Chesapeake Bay and other coastal environments.

Efficient cephalexin degradation using active chlorine produced on ruthenium and iridium oxide anodes: Role of bath composition, analysis of degradation pathways and degradation extent	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The elimination of cephalexin (CPX) using electro-generated Cl-2-active on Ti/RuO2-IrO2 anode was assessed in different effluents: deionized water (DW), municipal wastewater (MWW) and urine. Single Ti/RuO2 and Ti/IrO2 catalysts were prepared to compare their morphologies and electrochemical behavior against the binary DSA. XRD and profile refinement suggest that Ti/RuO2-IrO2 forms a solid solution, where RuO2 and IrO(2 )growths are oriented by the TiO2 substrate through substitution of Ir by Ru atoms within its rutile-type structure. SCM reveals mud-cracked structures with flat areas for all catalysts, while EDS analysis indicates atomic ratios in the range of the oxide stoichiometries in the nominal concentrations used during synthesis. A considerably higher CPX degradation is achieved in the presence of NaCl than in Na2SO4 or Na3PO4 media due to the active chlorine generation. A faster CPX degradation is reached when the current density is increased or the pH value is lowered. This last behavior may be ascribed to an acid-catalyzed reaction between HClO and CPX. Degradation rates of 22.5, 3.96, and 0.576 mu mol L-1 min(-1) were observed for DW, MWW and urine, respectively. The lower efficiency measured in these last two effluents was related to the presence of organic matter and urea in the matrix. A degradation pathway is proposed based on HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analysis, indicating the fast formation (5 min) of CPX-(S)-sulfoxide and CPX-(R)-sull'oxide, generated due the Cl-2-active attack at the CPX thioether. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity elimination of the treated solution is reached once CPX, and the initial by-products are considerably eliminated. Finally, even if only 16% of initial TOC is removed, BOD5 tests prove the ability of electro-generated Cl-2-active to transform the antibiotic into biodegradable compounds. A similar strategy can be used for the abatement of other recalcitrant compounds contained in real water matrices such as urine and municipal wastewaters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Green route for carbonylation of amines by CO2 using Sn-Ni-O bifunctional catalyst and theoretical study for finding best suited active sites	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Reaction between n-alkylamine and CO2 has gained interest due to the demand for the dialkylurea for various applications. For the first time, the tool Mathematica was used to analyze the experimental data with an idea to derive an equation which determines the best suited active sites for any given input set of dependent parameters. The equation can further be used to predict the product yield with the known values of active sites for a reaction. Among several Sn containing mixed oxides, Sn-Ni oxide (Sn-Ni-O) was found to be the better performing catalyst. The studies indicate that the formation of new defect sites when NiO and SnO2 are in the mixed state and possibly a solid solution enhances the catalytic efficiency. There are two main reasons for improved catalytic performance; one, mixing of SnO(2 )into NiO which reduces the number of holes (h(+)) localized on lattice oxygen (O2-+ h(+)-> O center dot-) and two, smaller SnO2 particles are dispersed on the bigger particle NiO which alters the acidic and basic active sites in the catalyst. FT-IR adsorption study with amine and CO2 helped in deriving a plausible mechanism for this reaction. Under optimized reaction condition, Sn1.1-Ni-O-600 gave 77.3% of n-butylamine conversion and 75.7% of yield for 1,3-dibutylurea. The versatility of the catalyst was tested for carbonylation of different aliphatic and aromatic amines, diamine and hydroxy amine with CO2.

Lysine desuccinylase SIRT5 binds to cardiolipin and regulates the electron transport chain	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY												SIRT5 is a lysine desuccinylase known to regulate mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and the urea cycle. Here, SIRT5 was observed to bind to cardiolipin via an amphipathic helix on itsN terminus. In vitro, succinyl-CoA was used to succinylate liver mitochondrial membrane proteins. SIRT5 largely reversed the succinyl-CoA-driven lysine succinylation. Quantitative mass spectrometry of SIRT5-treated membrane proteins pointed to the electron transport chain, particularly Complex I, as being highly targeted for desuccinylation by SIRT5. Correspondingly, SIRT5(-/)-HEK293 cells showed defects in both Complex I-and Complex II-driven respiration. In mouse liver, SIRT5 expression was observed to localize strictly to the periportal hepatocytes. However, homogenates prepared from whole SIRT5(-/)-liver did show reduced Complex II-driven respiration. The enzymatic activities of Complex II and ATP synthase were also significantly reduced. Three-dimensional modeling of Complex II suggested that several SIRT5-targeted lysine residues lie at the protein-lipid interface of succinate dehydrogenase subunit B. We postulate that succinylation at these sites may disrupt Complex II subunit-subunit interactions and electron transfer. Lastly, SIRT5(-/)-mice, like humans with Complex II deficiency, were found to have mild lactic acidosis. Our findings suggest that SIRT5 is targeted to protein complexes on the inner mitochondrial membrane via affinity for cardiolipin to promote respiratory chain function.

We used a targeted metabolomics approach utilizing a panel of 180 metabolites to gain insights into mechanisms of action and response to citalopram/escitalopram. Plasma samples from 136 participants with MDD enrolled into the Mayo Pharmacogenomics Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS) were profiled at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. After treatment, we saw increased levels of short-chain acylcarnitines and decreased levels of medium-chain and long-chain acylcarnitines, suggesting an SSRI effect on beta-oxidation and mitochondrial function. Amines-including arginine, proline, and methionine sulfoxide-were upregulated while serotonin and sarcosine were downregulated, suggesting an SSRI effect on urea cycle, one-carbon metabolism, and serotonin uptake. Eighteen lipids within the phosphatidylcholine (PC aa and ae) classes were upregulated. Changes in several lipid and amine levels correlated with changes in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores (HRSD17). Differences in metabolic profiles at baseline and post-treatment were noted between participants who remitted (HRSD17 <= 7) and those who gained no meaningful benefits (<30% reduction in HRSD17). Remitters exhibited (a) higher baseline levels of C3, C5, alpha-aminoadipic acid, sarcosine, and serotonin; and (b) higher week-8 levels of PC aa C34:1, PC aa C34:2, PC aa C36:2, and PC aa C36:4. These findings suggest that mitochondrial energetics-including acylcarnitine metabolism, transport, and its link to beta-oxidation-and lipid membrane remodeling may play roles in SSRI treatment response.

The PCMS nanomaterial successfully synthesized by echo free pyrolysis of neighborhood collected coconut shell at 450 degrees C under air atmospheric condition in a muffle furnace. From the physical characterization, we found that the formed product is crystalline in nature (powdered XRD) and the FTIR analysis provided the surface functionality and bonding, while the UV-Vis spectroscopy for the optical properties. The low-resolution SEM studies indicated for a uniform spherical like structure (1 mu M size) and the high-resolution TEM image support for the formation of PCMS absolutely in cubic structure (20 nm size). Hence, it may be an accumulation of the cubic nanocrystal to a spherical microstructure which has played vital performance due to the high surface area spherical structure and porosity. On testing of PCMS's sensing efficiency, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques showed well-detached oxidation peaks both for UA and DA. The lowest detection limits were observed to be 10 nM and 1 nM for the UA and DA respectively, and based on such low values of detection, this signal to noise ratio of the sensor can be applicable for real-time detection of UA and DA efflux from human nerve cells.

They have large surface areas, low framework densities, accessible cages, and tunnels with modifiable pores. Objective: The MOF MIL-101(Cr) with a large pore volume was synthesized hydrothermally and used in the electrochemical reactions as an electrocatalyst for the determination of ascorbic acid (AA). The synthesized MOF was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. Methods: The electrocatalytic behavior of a carbon paste electrode modified with MIL-101(Cr) was studied through electro-oxidation of AA by cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry. The conventional three-electrode cell system, consisting of Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and modified carbon paste as the working electrode, was used in the experiment. Results: Under optimized experimental conditions, the electrode revealed a linear relationship between the oxidation peak current and concentration of AA over a wide range from 0.01 to 10 mM with the LOD of 0.006 mM (3 Sb/m). The results showed that 100-fold of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO42-, sorbitol, sucrose, fructose, citric acid, 40-fold of NO3-, glucose, sucrose, urea, and 10-fold of uric acid had no significant interference. The method was adapted for the determination of the concentration of AA present in two real samples (vitamin C tablet and vitamin C effervescent tablet) with recovery of 97.0 and 96.0%, respectively. Conclusions: A simple, sensitive and reliable modified electrode has been established and applied for the determination of AA. Highlights: The modified electrode represented a good performance in the analysis of the real sample.

So far isolation and microbiological characterisation have only been successful for the designated type strain "Ferrovum myxofaciens" P3G. Thus, knowledge about physiological characteristics and the phylogeny of the genus "Ferrovum" is extremely scarce. Objective In order to access the wider genetic pool of the genus "Ferrovum" we sequenced the genome of a "Ferrovum"-containing mixed culture and successfully assembled the almost complete genome sequence of the novel "Ferrovum" strain JA12. Phylogeny and Lifestyle The genome-based phylogenetic analysis indicates that strain JA12 and the type strain represent two distinct "Ferrovum" species. "Ferrovum" strain JA12 is characterised by an unusually small genome in comparison to the type strain and other iron oxidising bacteria. The prediction of nutrient assimilation pathways suggests that "Ferrovum" strain JA12 maintains a chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle utilising carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, ammonium and urea, sulfate, phosphate and ferrous iron as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous and energy sources, respectively. Unique Metabolic Features The potential utilisation of urea by "Ferrovum" strain JA12 is moreover remarkable since it may furthermore represent a strategy among extreme acidophiles to cope with the acidic environment. Unlike other acidophilic chemolithoautotrophs "Ferrovum" strain JA12 exhibits a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle, a metabolic feature shared with the closer related neutrophilic iron oxidisers among the Betaproteobacteria including Sideroxydans lithotrophicus and Thiobacillus denitrificans. Furthermore, the absence of characteristic redox proteins involved in iron oxidation in the well-studied acidophiles Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (rusticyanin) and Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans (iron oxidase) indicates the existence of a modified pathway in "Ferrovum" strain JA12. Therefore, the results of the present study extend our understanding of the genus "Ferrovum" and provide a comprehensive framework for future comparative genome and metagenome studies.

J	Dai, SD; Zhang, JL; Fu, Y; Li, W				Dai, Shengdong; Zhang, Jinli; Fu, Yan; Li, Wei			Histidine-assisted synthesis of CeO2 nanoparticles for improving the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in methanol electrooxidation	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												His-CeO2 nanoparticles were synthesized under urea hydrolysis conditions using histidine as the growthdirecting agent. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicated that the His-CeO2 nanoparticles, which had a particle size of 12.2 nm, possessed a higher content of Ce3+ species and oxygen vacancies than bare CeO2 nanoparticles. Pt/His-CeO2-C electrocatalysts were constructed by using His-CeO2 nanoparticles as co-catalysts and exhibited enhanced catalytic performance in the methanol oxidation reaction. Because His-CeO2 co-catalysts supply sufficient OH ads sites and show strong interactions with Pt species, Pt/His-CeO2-C had better antipoisoning properties than Pt/CeO2-C. In cyclic voltammetry tests, the mass activity for Pt/His-CeO2-C was up to 1116.9 A g(-1), which is approximately 2.9 and 2.2 times greater than that of Pt/C-Z and commercial Pt/C-JM, respectively. These results pave the way for manufacturing Pt-based electrocatalysts for methanol electrooxidation with biomolecule-mediated modulation of the synergistic effects between the Pt species and metal oxides.					li, mengjie/GRS-3931-2022	Zhang, Jinli/0000-0001-5805-3824													1144-0546	1369-9261				NOV 21	2018	42	22					18159	18165		10.1039/c8nj03972k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8nj03972k													WOS:000452672700035

We report the discovery of an effective nitrification inhibitor, syringic acid, in the root exudates of rice. Nitrification inhibition activity by syringic acid was verified in both weakly acidic and neutral pure cultures of Nitrosomonas europaea, and was superior to the widely used synthetic nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD). Moreover, syringic acid exhibited a dual inhibitory effect on ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), active in ammonium/ammonia oxidation, and on urease, active in urea hydrolysis. Nitrification inhibition by syringic acid was also demonstrated in a paddy soil system, and the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) was significantly inhibited under all syringic acid treatments.

A facile formation of silver dendrites on indium tin oxide surfaces using electrodeposition and amperometric sensing of hydrazine	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL												Silver dendritic structures have been prepared using constant potential deposition on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes from an aqueous solution of AgNO3 and KNO3 without any surfactants or structure directing agents. The applied potential is shown to be a crucial factor in the formation of dendrites. Depending upon the magnitude of the applied potentials, morphologies vary from polygons to dendrites. The shape evolution of the silver dendrites has been investigated by varying the deposition time and metal precursors. The mechanism of formation of dendrites is interpreted using the diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) model. The fractal dimensions of the dendrites calculated using the box counting algorithm are in agreement with those predicted by the DLA model. The Ag dendrites coated ITO electrodes exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward oxidation of hydrazine in alkaline medium. The sensing of hydrazineis carried out with amperometry, where from the limit of detection and linear calibration range is deduced as 5 mu M and 100-1700 mu M respectively. The effect of ascorbic acid, urea, ethanol, glucose, K+, Cl-, Br- and I- ions as possible interfering agents in the detection of hydrazine is analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In regard to this reaction, we analyze the prospects of alpha manganese dioxide with a cryptomelane structure synthesized via an aqueous chemical route. To provide various specific surface area, the hydrated alpha-MnO2 oxide is annealed in a wide temperature range from 60 to 700 degrees C. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the oxide annealing temperature on the amount of crystal water, chemical composition, morphology, electrochemical recharging behavior, electrocatalytic activity and stability in the glucose oxidation carried out in an isotonic NaCl-based phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.40). To solidly determine potentials of the irreversible cathodic dissolution of alpha-MnO2 as well as O-2/Cl-2 evolution on alpha-MnO2, a rotating ring-disk electrode is applied. For the most active alpha-MnO2 sample with the 100 mu g cm(geo)(-2) loading the glucose oxidation current of ca. 40 mu A cm(geo)(-2) after 1 h at +0.8 V (SCE) for 7 mM of glucose is achieved. The linear concentration dependence in a physiological glucose range (1-30 mM) with the sensitivity of ca. 17.8 mu A mM(-0.5) cm(geo)(-2) at 25 degrees C is observed. Finally, glucose selectivity of alpha-MnO2 in relation to fructose, galactose, xylose, ribose, urea, lactic acid, acetone, ascorbic acid and paracetamol is revealed.

In the present work, a novel ultrasonic wave-assisted Fenton reaction strategy is employed to synthesize the surface reconstructed NiFe-LDH nanosheets cultivated directly on Ni foam (NiFe-LDH/NF-W). Morphological and structural characterizations reveal that the low-spin states of Ni2+ (t(2g)(6)e(g)(2)) and Fe2+ (t(2g)(4)e(g)(2)) on the NiFe-LDH surface partially transform into high-spin states of Ni3+ (t(2g)(6)e(g)(1)) and Fe3+ (t(2g)(3)e(g)(2)) and formation of the highly active species of NiFeOOH. A lower surface reconstruction thermodynamic barrier advantages the electrochemical process and enables the NiFe-LDH/NF-W electrode to exhibit superior electrocatalytic water oxidation activity, which delivers 10 mA cm(-2) merely needing an overpotential of 235 mV. Besides, surface reconstruction endows NiFe-LDH/NF-W with outstanding electrooxidation activities for organic molecules of methanol, ethanol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, glucose, and urea. Ultrasonic-assisted Fenton reaction inducing surface reconstruction strategy will further advance the utilization of NiFe-LDH catalyst in water and organics electrooxidation.

Oxidized Albumin as a Mediator of Kidney Disease	ANTIOXIDANTS												Renal diseases are a global health concern, and nearly 24% of kidney disease patients are overweight or obese. Particularly, increased body mass index has been correlated with oxidative stress and urinary albumin excretion in kidney disease patients, also contributing to increased cardiovascular risk. Albumin is the main plasma protein and is able to partially cross the glomerular filtration barrier, being reabsorbed mainly by the proximal tubule through different mechanisms. However, it has been demonstrated that albumin suffers different posttranslational modifications, including oxidation, which appears to be tightly linked to kidney damage progression and is increased in obese patients. Plasma-oxidized albumin levels correlate with a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate and an increase in blood urea nitrogen in patients with chronic kidney disease. Moreover, oxidized albumin in kidney disease patients is independently correlated with higher plasma levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6. In addition, oxidized albumin exerts a direct effect on neutrophils by augmenting the levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, a well-accepted biomarker for renal damage in patients and in different experimental settings. Moreover, it has been suggested that albumin oxidation occurs at early stages of chronic kidney disease, accelerating the patient requirements for dialytic treatment during disease progression. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting the role of overweight- and obesity-induced oxidative stress as a critical factor for the progression of renal disease and cardiovascular morbimortality through albumin oxidation.

J	Bröer, S; Bröer, A				Broer, Stefan; Broer, Angelika			Amino acid homeostasis and signalling in mammalian cells and organisms	BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												Cells have a constant turnover of proteins that recycle most amino acids over time. Net loss is mainly due to amino acid oxidation. Homeostasis is achieved through exchange of essential amino acids with non-essential amino acids and the transfer of amino groups from oxidised amino acids to amino acid biosynthesis. This homeostatic condition is maintained through an active mTORC1 complex. Under amino acid depletion, mTORC1 is inactivated. This increases the breakdown of cellular proteins through autophagy and reduces protein biosynthesis. The general control non-derepressable 2/ATF4 pathway may be activated in addition, resulting in transcription of genes involved in amino acid transport and biosynthesis of non-essential amino acids. Metabolism is autoregulated to minimise oxidation of amino acids. Systemic amino acid levels are also tightly regulated. Food intake briefly increases plasma amino acid levels, which stimulates insulin release and mTOR-dependent protein synthesis in muscle. Excess amino acids are oxidised, resulting in increased urea production. Short-term fasting does not result in depletion of plasma amino acids due to reduced protein synthesis and the onset of autophagy. Owing to the fact that half of all amino acids are essential, reduction in protein synthesis and amino acid oxidation are the only two measures to reduce amino acid demand. Long-term malnutrition causes depletion of plasma amino acids. The CNS appears to generate a protein-specific response upon amino acid depletion, resulting in avoidance of an inadequate diet. High protein levels, in contrast, contribute together with other nutrients to a reduction in food intake.

Redox-configurable ambidextrous catalysis: structural and mechanistic insight	CHEMICAL SCIENCE												A ligand capable of adopting two pseudo-enantiomeric helically chiral states when bound to copper has been applied as an asymmetric catalyst in the Michael addition of malonate substrates to nitrostyrenes. The absolute configuration of the helically chiral ligand is inverted upon oxidation/reduction of the copper center. In this way, the handedness of the Michael addition product (R/S) can be selected based on the handedness of the catalyst (Lambda/Delta). Exciton coupled circular dichroism (ECCD) was used to identify which of the two pseudo-enantiomeric forms the catalyst adopted after reduction/oxidation, with additional support from X-ray crystallographic data. The synthesis of the ligand was achieved in five steps with an overall 61% yield. Enantiomeric excesses of the Michael addition products of up to 72% (S) and 70% (R) were obtained in acetonitrile. The ability to choose the handedness of the product based on the chiral state of the catalyst has been demonstrated with several different solvents, bases, nitrostyrene/malonate substrates, and prochiral malonate substrates. A combination of molecular modelling, crystal structure and kinetic data suggest that one urea moiety of the catalyst ligand likely binds the nitrostyrene substrate while blocking the Re face of the nitrostyrene in the transition state.

Thereby the number of the innovative synthetic methodologies has been reported for constructions of this scaffold, which includes metal catalyzed and metal free method, multicomponent, domino one pot protocol, oxidation, Friedel-Crafts type of cyclization. In the recent years many general protocols for the construction of this scaffold were reported in the literature and there is no focussed individual review for the 3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one since 2001. This review focuses on the reports describing the new method for the synthesis of 3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one, published since 2001 to till date. In this review, we approach method of the synthesis of 3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one according to the strategy used for its synthesis, which includes, the intramolecular cyclization of carbamate/ urea/ thiourea/ isocyanate/ azidoamide, carbonylation/ carbomylation/ carbonyl insertion, metal catalyzed protocols by C-H activation by directing group, metal free domino procedures and oxidations of isoquinoline derivatives that were included in recent publications.

In this study, nanoporous gold (NPG) was selected for glucose oxidase (GOx) immobilization and glucose biosensor fabrication because of its open, highly conductive, biocompatible, and interconnected porous structure, which also facilitates the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. The electrochemical reaction on the surface of the resulting GOx/NPG/GCE bioelectrode was attributed to the co-catalysis effect of GOx and NPG. A surface-confined reaction in a phosphate buffer solution was observed at the bioelectrode during cyclic voltammetry experiments. Linear responses were observed for large glucose concentrations ranging from 50 mu M to 10 mM, with a high sensitivity of 12.1 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and a low detection limit of 1.02 mu M. Furthermore, the GOx/NPG/GCE bioelectrode presented strong anti-interference capability against cholesterol, urea, tributyrin, ascorbic acid, and uric acid, along with a long shelf-life. For the detection of glucose in human serum, the data generated by the GOx/NPG/GCE bioelectrode were in good agreement with those produced by an automatic biochemical analyzer. These unique properties make the GOx/NPG/ GCE bioelectrode an excellent choice for the construction of a glucose biosensor. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the influence of fulvic acid (FA), as a microbial carbon source, on carbon and nitrogen cycles in paddy soils remains elusive. Therefore, to investigate it, an incubation experiment was conducted. Gas analyses indicated that the carbon dioxide and methane emissions were enhanced in FA treatment, which increased up to 94.08-fold and 5.06-fold, respectively. 15N-labeling experiments revealed that nitrogen fixation capability was promoted (1.2-fold) to reduce the carbon and nitrogen imbalance due to fulvic acid amendment. Metagenomic analysis further revealed that gene abundances of degradation of lignin-like compounds, gallate degradation, methanogenesis, nitrogen fixation, and urea hydrolysis increased, while the bacterial ammonia oxidation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation decreased, caused by FA application. Metabolic reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that Azospirillaceae, Methanosarcinaceae, and Bathyarchaeota, with higher abundance in FA treatment, were the key microorganisms to maintain the carbon and nitrogen balance. The metabolic pathways of fulvic acid degradation and coupled nitrogen fixation and retention were constructed. Collectively, our results provided novel insights into the theoretical basis of the use of humic substances for reducing nitrogen fertilization and climate change.

Methods In experimental animal studies, CKD was established by 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx). Serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were determined. Histopathologic tests were performed by HE and Masson trichrome stained. The level of ROS was investigated by fluorescence microplate with the probe 2 ', 7 '-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). The protein expressions of p47phox and gp91phox were measured in 5/6Nx rats. In HK-2 cells, the expression of SIRT3 and Foxo3 alpha was measured in SIRT3 knockdown conditions. The indicators of oxidation and fibrosisi were measured in SIRT3 knockdown conditions. Key findings The results showed that, in addition to reducing renal interstitial pathologic injury and collagen fibrils, rhein administration improved renal function. The protective mechanisms were attributed to active SIRT3/FOXO3 alpha signalling pathway and then play the anti-oxidative capacity of rhein, as well as to subsequent antifibrotic effect. Conclusion Taken together, rhein protected kidney through SIRT3/FOXO3a involvement. The anti-oxidative capacity of rhein contributed to the protective effects including the subsequent antifibrotic responses.

The electrochemical process used a mixture of low-costDES (choline chloride-urea) and water as the electrolyte, inwhich DES acts as a triple role of intercalation, interlayer expansion,and anti-oxidation. DES attached to the surface and interlayer oflayered Ti3C2 formed an antioxidative protectivecover, resulting in the layered Ti3C2 beinggrafted with hydroxyl functional groups instead of forming TiO2 in water during the entire exfoliation process. The preparedMXene-DES exhibits fewer layers, larger interlayer spacing,higher degree of hydroxylation, and stronger oxidation resistancethan the MXene prepared by traditional ultrasound in a nitrogen atmosphere(MXene-N-2). The symmetric flexible solid-state supercapacitorbased on an activated carbon electrode and the composite gel polymerelectrolyte composed of MXene-DES, DES, and polyvinyl alcoholexhibits good mechanical properties, a wide voltage window of 2.3V, and a high specific capacitance of 133.7 F center dot g(-1) (0.1 A center dot g(-1)).

NRSBC800 was then characterized using XPS, BET, TEM and other technologies, and its catalytic performance as an activator for permonosulfate (PMS) to degrade acid orange 7 (AO7) was studied. The results show that the introduction of N-doping significantly improved the catalytic performance of NRSBC800. The NRSBC800/PMS oxidation system could fully degrade AO7 within 30 min, with the reaction rate constant (2.1 x 10 (-1) min(-1)) being 38 times that of RSBC800 (5.5 x 10(-3) min(-1)). Moreover, NRSBC800 not only had better catalytic performance than traditional metal oxides (Co3O4 and Fe3O4) and carbon nanomaterial (CNT) but also received less impact from environmental water factors (such as anions and humic acids) during the catalytic degradation process. In addition, a quenching test and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) research both indicated that AO7 degradation relied mainly on non-free radical oxidation (primarily singlet oxygen (O-1(2))). A recycling experiment further demonstrated NRSBC800's high stability after recycling three times.					; Liu, Hui/U-7073-2019	sun, Ping/0000-0002-0698-7497; Liu, Hui/0000-0002-3121-3311														2079-4991				SEP	2021	11	9							2288	10.3390/nano11092288	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano11092288								34578604					WOS:000701409600001

This study develops a double-step potential method to prepare an unprecedentedly stellated Au nanocrystals (NCs) bounded by high-index {711} and {331} facets in deep eutectic solvent (DES) medium. The formation of Au NCs bounded by HIFs was systematically studied. It has demonstrated that the shapes of Au NCs are strongly dependent on the size of seeds and the growth potentials as well as the urea adsorbates in the DES. By adjusting the size of seeds and the growth potentials, the stellated Au NCs can be transformed into concave hexoctahedra (HOH) with high-index {421} facets and concave trisoctahedra (TOH) with high-index {991} facets. The electrocatalytic activities of the as-prepared Au NCs are evaluated by glucose oxidation. Thanks to HIFs having high density of atomic steps and kinks) the stellated, TOH, and HOH Au NCs exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity than that of the polycrystalline Au electrode, demonstrating that the steps and kinks serve as the active sites and play an important role in glucose electro-oxidation.					jinyu, ye/IXD-1758-2023; yang, qin/GVR-9226-2022; Lu, Bang-An/AAC-6164-2019; Sun, S.G./G-3408-2010; Sheng, Tian/G-1120-2017; Zhou, Zhi-You/G-4690-2010	Sheng, Tian/0000-0001-5711-3012; Zhou, Zhi-You/0000-0001-5181-0642; Lu, Bang-An/0000-0002-4532-598X													0743-7463					JUL 18	2017	33	28					6991	6998		10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b00964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b00964								28657756					WOS:000406086000005

We report in this research that a homogeneous process, thiourea dioxide (TDO) coupled with trace Cu(II) (several micromoles, ubiquitous in some wastewater), is effective for reductive deiodination and degradation of diatrizoate at neutral pH values. Specifically, the molar ratio of iodide released to TDO consumed reached 2 under ideal experimental conditions. TDO eventually decomposed into urea and sulfite/sulfate. Based on the results of diatrizoate degradation, TDO decomposition, and Cu(I) generation and consumption during the TDO-Cu(II) reaction, we confirmed that Cu(I) is responsible for diatrizoate degradation. However, free Cu(I) alone did not work. It was proposed that Cu(I) complexes are actual reactive species toward diatrizoate. Inorganic anions and effluent organic matter negatively influence diatrizoate degradation, but by increasing the TDO dosage, as well as extending the reaction time, its degradation efficiency can still be guaranteed for real hospital wastewater. This reduction reaction could be potentially useful for in situ deiodination and degradation of diatrizoate in hospital wastewater before discharge into municipal sewage networks.					wang, Lihong/MGA-7080-2025; Chen, Zhiqiang/AGX-7909-2022; Zhang, Tao/J-1586-2016	Zhang, Tao/0000-0003-3708-7755													0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 7	2021	55	17					12009	12018		10.1021/acs.est.1c03823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c03823		AUG 2021						34431661					WOS:000695530700055

Several electrochemical techniques were used to verify the sustainability of catalytic properties of the electrode material after exposure to different compounds, i.e. ascorbic acid (AA), glycine, urea, acetylsalicylic acid (AsA), and acetaminophen (AAp). Through analysis of impedance data, we concluded that AAp and AsA were trapped permanently in the Nafion membrane, which significantly affected results repeatability. These observations were also confirmed by FT-IR investigations of the membrane after its immersion in solutions containing different interfering species. Moreover, after exposure to AsA and, unexpectedly, large concentrations of urea, the catalytic properties were completely lost, which, in consequence, make sensor reuse impossible. Such behaviour was justified by the chain reorganisation and swelling. Mechanisms involving adsorption onto the interphase and absorption in the membrane were proposed as key factors responsible for deterioration of membrane functionality and were confronted with FT-IR investigations. Following that, application of Nafion for non-invasive glucose sensor protection is unsatisfactory and cannot be considered for multiple detection procedures, especially taking into account biological fluids full of different interfering species.

Herein, urea was mixed with tourmaline (TM) and calcined to obtain g-C3N4/TM composite photocatalyst. Under solar light, g-C3N4/TM activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade carbamazepine (CBZ) entirely within 25 min. g-C3N4/TM had a superior photocatalytic oxidation performance under solar light than g-C3N4. Photogenerated electron-hole pairs of g-C3N4 were efficaciously suppressed, originating from the more excellent electronic transfer to TM. Four active species, including SO4 center dot(-), center dot OH, O-1(2), and O-2 center dot(-), were identified for the degradation of CBZ. Ten intermediates of CBZ and six intermediates of sulfaquinoxaline sodium (SQXNa) were determined by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a high definition mass spectrometer (UPLC-HDMS), and a degradation pathway was proposed. As the reaction progressed, all aromatic nuclear intermediates were mineralized. The degradation of other organic pollutants by the g-C3N4/TM/PMS system validated the universal adaptability in practical applications. This research provided an effective way to improve the g-C3N4 photocatalytic activity in wastewater treatment.					wang, zhendong/ABG-6897-2021; Zhu, Zhexin/AAH-3933-2020; Lu, Wangyang/J-9067-2014	Lu, Wangyang/0000-0002-5650-0675													0022-4596	1095-726X				MAR	2023	319								123806	10.1016/j.jssc.2022.123806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssc.2022.123806		DEC 2022											WOS:000914201100001

In this study, we investigated the synergism effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Urtica dioica and pioglitazone (PIO) on the prevention of DN in streptozotocin induced-diabetic mice. Materials and Methods: Forty-two mice were divided into six groups as follows: non-diabetic control group, DMSO group (as solvent), diabetic group and four treatment groups which received U. dioica, pioglitazone, U. dioica plus pioglitazone and vitE. Diabetes was induced by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (200 mg/kg body wt, IP) diluted in citrate buffer (pH= 4.6). After 4 weeks treatment, all animals were anaesthetized and blood was collected for serum urea and creatinine levels assessment in plasma and kidney tissue were excised for evaluation of oxidative stress markers. Results: Treatment with U. dioica significantly inhibited increase in serum urea and creatinine in plasma that were observed in diabetic mice. Furthermore, the elevated level of oxidative stress markers (glutathione oxidation, lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl) in renal supernatant of diabetic mice was inhibited by U. dioica treatment. Interestingly, U. dioica promoted beneficial effects of PIO in reducing STZ-induced hyperglycemia, renal damage and oxidative stress markers. Conclusion: Our findings showed that PIO plus U. dioica have synergism protective effects against STZ-induced nephropathy that can be a candidate as a therapeutic approach in order to treatment of DN.

Herein, a unique heterostructural photocatalyst, nonstoichiometric bismuth oxyiodide Bi2O3-xI2x(x=0.243) covered with iodine intercalated Bi2O2CO3, were developed through a treatment of Bi7O9I3 in urea solution and subsequent calcinations. The interesting formation chemistry of this heterostructure were revealed and their dramatically enhanced photoresponse properties were studied. The lower amount of iodine in Bi2O3-xI2x contributes a higher oxidation potential of photogenerated holes, while the presence of outlayer of iodine intercalated Bi2O2CO3 retards the transformation of inner bismuth oxyiodide. We anticipate this strategy can be generalized to tune iodine contents and to fabricate delicate BOB photocatalytic heterostructures with desirable performance for environmental applications.

A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Nanoscience emerged in the late 1980s and is developed and applied in China since the middle of the 1990s. Although nanotechnologies have been less developed in agronomy than other disciplines, due to less investment, nanotechnologies have the potential to improve agricultural production. Here, we review more than 200 reports involving nanoscience in agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture. The major points are as follows: (1) nanotechnologies used for seeds and water improved plant germination, growth, yield, and quality. (2) Nanotechnologies could increase the storage period for vegetables and fruits. (3) For livestock and poultry breeding, nanotechnologies improved animals immunity, oxidation resistance, and production and decreased antibiotic use and manure odor. For instance, the average daily gain of pig increased by 9.9-15.3 %, the ratio of feedstuff to weight decreased by 7.5-10.3 %, and the diarrhea rate decreased by 55.6-66.7 %. (4) Nanotechnologies for water disinfection in fishpond increased water quality and increased yields and survivals of fish and prawn. (5) Nanotechnologies for pesticides increased pesticide performance threefold and reduced cost by 50 %. (6) Nano urea increased the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilization by 44.5 % and the grain yield by 10.2 %, versus normal urea. (7) Nanotechnologies are widely used for rapid detection and diagnosis, notably for clinical examination, food safety testing, and animal epidemic surveillance. (8) Nanotechnologies may also have adverse effects that are so far not well known.																			1774-0746	1773-0155				APR	2015	35	2					369	400		10.1007/s13593-014-0274-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-014-0274-x													WOS:000351871500001

The effect of the previously mentioned compounds was analyzed applying structural (primary crystallite size, crystal phase composition, etc.), morphological (particle geometry), optical (band gap energy) parameters, surface related properties (surface atoms' oxidation states), and the resulted photocatalytic activity. A strong dependency was found between the surface tension of the synthesis solutions and the overall morpho-structural parameters. The main finding was that the characteristics of the semiconductors can be tuned by modifying the surface tension of the synthesis mixture. It was observed after the photocatalytic degradation, that the white semiconductor turned to grey. Furthermore, we attempted to explain the gray color of BiOCl catalysts after the photocatalytic decompositions by Raman and XPS studies.

Chestnut shells consist of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and have a low calorific value. We propose a method to produce a biochar with a high calorific value from chestnut shells by catalytic pre-oxidation and pyrolysis with sulfuric acid and urea. The pyrolysis behavior and the changes in structure and properties were investigated. Results indicate that the catalysts slow the pyrolysis reaction, leading to a high-quality char. The carbon content and calorific value are related to the pyrolysis temperature. When the chestnut shells are pyrolyzed at 750 degrees C, the yield and calorific value of the char are 44.31 wt% and 35.48 MJ/Kg, respectively. The calorific value of the char is higher than that of first-level cleaned coal (30.00 MJ/Kg).

It has a normal spinel structure and, as with many other spinels, amazing functional properties thanks to its peculiar structural features. In the past, its spectroscopic, optical, magnetic and electronic properties were determined; then, for many years, this compound was left behind.

Short-term dynamics of nano- and picoplankton production in an embayment of the southern Benguela upwelling region	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												In the southern Benguela ecosystem, regenerated production and high levels of organic matter remineralisation are expected to dominate during periods of relaxation. To study microbial growth and productivity under these remineralising conditions, we measured size fractionated (micro-nanoplankton: 10-200 & mu;m and nano-picoplankton: 0.3-10 & mu;m) net primary production, uptake rates of nitrate, ammonium, and urea, as well as nano-and picoplankton community composition and biomass over five consecutive days in autumn (March 2018). Samples were collected from three depths (1 m, 25 m, and 50 m) at a single station in St Helena Bay and abundances of nanophytoplankton, picophytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria were determined using flow cytometry. There were differences in productivity among days but depth-differentiation was more apparent in the rates of net primary production and nitrogen uptake, with the highest rates (rate & PLUSMN; SD) (NPP: 3.36 & PLUSMN; 1.82 & mu;mol L-1 d-1; pNO3 -: 0.30 & PLUSMN; 0.18 & mu;mol L-1 d-1; pNH4+: 2.27 & PLUSMN; 0.75 & mu;mol L-1 d-1; pUrea: 1.38 & PLUSMN; 0.02 & mu;mol L-1 d-1) measured at the surface. Ammonium and urea uptake rates were two-to six-fold higher than those of nitrate, indicating that most of the biomass was produced through regenerated production with f-ratios of 0.02-0.21. Nano-picoplankton comprised 67% of the carbon biomass and were responsible for 90% of net primary pro-duction and 79-85% of total nitrogen (i.e., nitrate + ammonium + urea) uptake. Small cell size likely conferred advantages on nano-picoplankton in the nutrient-deplete euphotic zone and the low-oxygen (<89.3 & mu;mol L-1) conditions at 25 m and 50 m. Nitrite oxidation rates were fastest at deeper depths where heterotrophic bacteria were most abundant. Heterotrophic bacteria also contributed the most (95%) carbon biomass at all depths, suggesting a major role for these microorganisms in carbon and nitrogen cycling throughout the water column of St Helena Bay.

The electrocatalytic performances of the obtained NiO/NCS modified glass carbon electrodes showed superior activity for direct electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose than that of nitrogen free NiO/carbon sphere (NiO/CS), which might be due to the synergistic effect of the properties of NCS and NiO nanoparticles. The introduce of nitrogen can improve the conductivity of the NiO/NCS and accordingly accelerate the electron transport within the composites, which was very beneficial to improve the sensitivity to glucose detection for NiO/NCS modified electrodes. The NiO/NCS electrodes exhibited two corresponding linear regions of 1-800 mu M and 4-9 mM with the sensitivity of 398.57 mu A mM (1) cm (2) and 17.81 mu A mM (1) cm (2), and the detection limit of 0.25 mu M and 0.05 mM respectively. Moreover, the NiO/NCS composites have also exhibited good selectivity by adding certain amount of urea, NaCl, L-proline, L-valine, L-Leucine and ascorbic acid into the 0.1 M NaOH solution, respectively. The high sensitivity, wide glucose detection range and good selectivity of the electrodes may ensure its potential applications in the clinical diagnosis of diabetes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the hierarchical porous BCN catalyst was synthesized using a ternary deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of boric acid, urea and choline chloride as the precursor and template. The as-prepared BCN exhibited impressive catalytic performance in oxidative desulfurization of fuel. Under the optimized conditions, the BCN catalyst can reach 98.4% sulfur removal in 4 h and recycle 5 times with a little activity decrease. Experimental results revealed that the excellent catalytic activity was found to be originated from an improved electron delocalization. Combined with the density functional theory (DFT), the improved electron delocalization increased the electronic density of the BCN, promoting the activation of dioxygen. This strategy provides a novel approach for the design of high-performance catalyst in oxidative desulfurization.					huaming, li/S-1885-2016; Wu, Peiwen/GOK-0470-2022; li, hongping/JBR-8611-2023; Wang, Jigang/K-9584-2014	Zhu, Wen shuai/0000-0002-7782-5794; Wu, Peiwen/0000-0002-4086-4706													1387-1811	1873-3093				FEB	2020	293								109788	10.1016/j.micromeso.2019.109788	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micromeso.2019.109788													WOS:000504505500019

Physicochemical characterizations were carried out to evaluate its comprehensive performance in the adsorption/desorption process. The sorbent has exhibited optimum porous structure, high CO2/N-2 selectivity, acceptable CO2 uptake, and enhanced anti-oxidation and anti urea capacities. Notably, the energy penalty for sorbent regeneration is 2.31 MJ.kg(-1)(CO2), lower than the consumptions in the systems of alcohol amine absorption or poly(ethyleneimine)-silica adsorption.

Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has a low thermodynamic onset potential, which is an effective reaction to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in overall seawater splitting and avoid toxic hypochlorite generation. In this paper, we report sulfur-doped NiFe LDH with ultrathin nanoflower morphology on the surface of three-dimensional nickel foam (NF) loaded with Ti3C2Tx MXene by the two-step electrodeposition method (S-NiFe LDH/MXene@NF). The catalytic performance of electrolytic seawater is boosted by the synergistic effect of the abundant interface between Ti3C2Tx MXene and sulfur-doped NiFe LDH, which promotes electron transfer. S-NiFe LDH/MXene@NF exhibited electrocatalytic performance values of 1.578 and 1.437 V (vs RHE) for OER and UOR at 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, and an overpotential of 336 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 500 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline seawater electrolyte. As a bifunctional electrode, it can achieve a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at 2.027 V with great stability. The in situ Raman detection of surface recombination of the S-NiFe LDH/MXene@NF electrode in the UOR demonstrates that Ti3C2Tx MXene accelerates the formation of the active species NiOOH on the electrode surface and facilitates the lattice disturbance of NiOOH. This helps to increase the catalytic activity of urea-assisted overall seawater splitting.					汤, 儆/GZG-7946-2022														2168-0485					JUL 25	2024	12	31					11520	11530		10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c01271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c01271		JUL 2024											WOS:001277881700001

In this study, a fluorescent probe called NBR-AP for detecting tyrosinase (a biomarker of melanoma) has been created by incorporating a hydroxyphenylurea group (as a substrate for the enzyme) onto a fluorescent dye phenoxazine derivative (as an activatable signal reporter). This probe can be activated to generate fluorescence through a tyrosinase-mediated oxidation followed by hydrolysis of the urea linkage. The probe is able to detect the endogenous tyrosinase level in live cells and in zebrafish sensitively and selectively. Moreover, by imaging the tyrosinase activity, NBR-AP has been successfully applied to diagnose the melanoma and its metastasis in xenogeneic mouse models established via subcutaneous injection of B16F10 cells.

Endogenous mechanisms for reducing glutamate concentration in the brain parenchyma following TBI are poorly understood. Using multiple mass spectrometry approaches, we examined TBI-induced changes to glutamate metabolism. We present evidence that glutamate concentration can be reduced by glutamate oxidation via a "truncated" tricarboxylic acid cycle coupled to the urea cycle. This process reduces glutamate levels, generates carbon for energy metabolism, leads to citrulline accumulation, and produces nitric oxide. Several key metabolites are identified by metabolomics in support of this mechanism and the locations of these metabolites in the injured hemisphere are demonstrated by MALDI-MS imaging. The results of this study establish the advantages of multiple mass spectrometry approaches and provide insights into glutamate metabolism following TBI that could lead to improved treatment approaches.

Nevertheless, the impacts and processes of water and nitrogen on grain yield in WDR remain unclear.Methods In this study, Hanyou 73 (WDR) and Hyou 518 (rice) were used as materials. Three kinds of nitrogen fertilizer application rate (NFAR) were set in the pot experiment, including no NFAR (nitrogen as urea applied at 0 g/pot), medium NFAR (nitrogen as urea applied at 15.6 g/pot), and high NFAR (nitrogen as urea applied at 31.2 g/pot). Two irrigation regimes, continuous flooding cultivation and water stress, were set under each NFAR. The relationships between root and shoot morphophysiology and grain yield in WDR were explored.Results The results demonstrated the following: 1) under the same irrigation regime, the grain yield of two varieties increased with the increase of NFAR. Under the same NFAR, the reduction of irrigation amount significantly reduced the grain yield in Hyou 518 (7.1%-15.1%) but had no substantial influence on the grain yield in Hanyou 73. 2) Under the same irrigation regime, increasing the NFAR could improve the root morphophysiology (root dry weight, root oxidation activity, root bleeding rate, root total absorbing surface area, root active absorbing surface area, and zeatin + zeatin riboside contents in roots) and aboveground physiological indexes (leaf photosynthetic rate, non-structural carbohydrate accumulation in stems, and nitrate reductase activity in leaves) in two varieties. Under the same NFAR, increasing the irrigation amount could significantly increase the above indexes in Hyou 518 (except root dry weight) but has little effect on Hanyou 73. 3) Analysis of correlations revealed that the grain yield of Hyou 518 and Hanyou 73 was basically positively correlated with aboveground physiology and root morphophysiology, respectively.Conclusion The grain yield could be maintained by water stress under medium NFAR in WDR. The improvement of root morphophysiology is a major factor for high yield under the irrigation regime and NFAR treatments in WDR.

Effects of urea and H2O2 concentration on NO conversion were investigated. Pulse experiments were carried out to investigate the change of NO conversion with time under different concentrations of H2O2. The contribution of each route that NO converted and the selectivities of products were calculated. Results showed that the photo-reduction of NO accounted for 2%, and the photo-oxidation of NO accounted for 14%, and the rest was absorbed by the humidifier. Products include ammonia (NH+ 4-N), nitrogen (N-2), nitrite (NO- 2-N) and nitrate (NO- 3-N), of which N-2 accounted for 9%.

In addition, only a low cell voltage of 1.48 V is required to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for sufficient water splitting in the UOR || HER coupled system.

In this study, we describe a new process for recycling Nd permanent magnets (PMs). PM scrap powder was leached into a waste pickling solution, evaporated under reduced pressure, concentrated, and converted into an oxide via heat treatment. Nd was selectively leached from the prepared oxide using hydrochloric acid. Iron was removed from the leached solution, and the Nd composite was then recovered using a urea-mediated Nd-recovery method. The oxidation temperature was determined using a thermogravimetric analysis. High-purity Nd-oxide powders were obtained by calcination at 900 degrees C. This economical process enables the recovery of PM powder by relying on the pickling process and acid-regeneration plants, which are both essential in steel manufacturing.

Here, the characteristics of nitrogen oxide emissions from the combustion synthesis of CuO oxygen carriers were investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. In addition, the NO and NO2 emissions were tested by an ultraviolet flue gas analyzer. The effects of gas flow rate, combustion atmosphere, heating rate, and the amount of urea complexant on nitrogen oxide emissions, and the feasibility of NOx reduction by NH3 during combustion were discussed. The chemical phases, element distributions, phase structure of precursors, and the valence states of Cu in the solid products were analyzed. The results showed that the combustion synthesis of CuO produced heat and erupted gas-phase products. NOx and N2O species were mainly generated from nitrogen in the precursors. The urea complexant also greatly contributed to NOx emissions, and the NOx emissions from urea-based precursors reached 5500 mg/m3, which was almost ten times higher than that of the urea-free precursors. An air atmosphere favored NO, NO2, and N2O generation. An even and complete combustion produced less nitrogen oxide emissions. The grinding of precursors into particles reduced NOx emissions by 3-89%.

J	Peters, N; Thiele-Bruhn, S				Peters, Nils; Thiele-Bruhn, Soeren			Major metabolites of NBPT degradation pathways contribute to urease inhibition in soil	CHEMOSPHERE												Urea is the most commonly used nitrogen fertilizer worldwide. However, depending on soil and environmental conditions, high nitrogen losses can occur due to gaseous ammonia emissions. Urease inhibitors like N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) reduce these losses by blocking the urease enzyme, which catalyzes urea hydrolysis. With the increasing use of NBPT its environmental fate and features of urease inhibition become increasingly important. This study aimed to further elucidate major NBPT degradation pathways and related urease inhibition in soil. This was investigated in a 14-d incubation experiment using practice-relevant application rates of NBPT and four of its metabolites N-(n-butyl)phosphoric triamide (NBPTO), diamido phosphoric acid (DAP), diamido thiophosphoric acid (DATP) and rac-N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric diamide (NBPD), covering three postulated degradation pathways. Additionally, the urease inhibition by these compounds was determined and further investigated in 2-h tests. The latter provided dose-response curves, showing that all substances inhibited urease, with NBPTO being the most effective. Inhibition of urease in NBPT-spiked soil was also largely, but not completely, attributed to NBPTO formed within the test period. In 14-d incubation tests, all investigated compounds dissipated quickly by > 90% within 6 d (NBPTO), 3 d (NBPT) and <= 1 d (DAP, DATP and NBPD). Extensive oxidation of NBPT to NBPTO and subsequent minor formation of DAP was identified as the preferred degradation pathway. Abiotic degradation processes in sterile soil corresponded to 65-90% of total degradation in microbial active soil. Furthermore, pseudo-first order dissipation kinetics were retarded in sterile soil. Urease activity, calculated as a percentage of activity in the urea-fertilized control, was lowest after about 2 d when NBPTO was spiked to soil (17.9%), followed by NBPT (35.7%), DATP (51.3%), NBPD (54.0%), and DAP (54.4%). This shows that urease inhibition depends on the interplay of NBPT and its degradation products.

The influence of the seeding procedure on the morphology of the obtained WO3 nanostructure was systematically investigated. The synthesized WO3 NGs were revealed to have a single crystalline structure with a large aspect ratio and perpendicular alignment on FTO substrates. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting properties of the annealed WO3 NGs were performed in 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer solution (pH 7), exhibiting an onset potential of ca. -0.1 V vs. SCE and a maximum photocurrent density of 1.2 mA cm(-2) under 1.5 G illumination. Growth time-dependent PEC activity and specific surface area data confirm that the efficient PEC activity of WO3 NGs is attributed to their high specific surface area, which is beneficial in enlarging the WO3/solution interface for water oxidation. This two-step hydrothermal growth technique demonstrates a unique advantage in ensuring firm adhesion of the WO3 film to the FTO substrate and offers a novel route for improving the performance of PEC water splitting devices.

The results indicated that the Ti/SnO2-Sb/Gd-PbO2 anode demonstrated the best performance with the degradation rate constants being 0.095 min(-1) in fresh urine and 0.045 min-1 in hydrolyzed urine at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The electrochemical degradation was improved in the presence of phosphate and chloride, while the degradation was obviously inhibited by urea, bicarbonate and ammonia. Degradation mechanism mainly involved ether-bond cleavage, hydroxylation, cyclization, dehydrogenation and carboxylation. Quantitative structure-activity relationship model showed that ecological risks of cyclization products to fish, daphnid and green algae was higher than the parent compound, implying that the potential risks to aquatic organism should not be ignored before triclosan mineralized completely. Energy consumption for 90% triclosan degradation ranged from 4.5 to 47.8 Wh L-1, and the consumption increased along with the hydrolysis of urine. The results indicate that electrochemical oxidation is a feasible and energy-saving technique to effectively remove triclosan from human urine. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Enhanced dispersion and electronic performance of single-walled carbon nanotube thin films without surfactant: A comprehensive study of various treatment processes	CARBON												A method for enhancing electronic performance of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin films through enhanced dispersion of SWCNTs in aqueous solutions is presented. The best dispersion enhancement is obtained by covalent attachment of urea to the acid functionalized SWCNTs. Dispersion properties of urea treatment are compared to conventional chemical and physical treatment techniques, such as surfactants. The treatment type and time significantly influence SWCNT surface functionalization, which determines the dispersion effectiveness as described by the SWCNT aggregate size, morphology and stability. The findings suggest that urea-SWCNTs, as compared to surfactant dispersed-SWCNTs, resulted in the most effective dispersion method among chemical treatments, yielding the smallest monodispersed aggregates with the most rod-like morphology that were stable over the greatest range in pH. Thin films prepared with SWCNT samples were evaluated for their transparency and resistance, two metrics that are important for electronics device applications. The urea-SWCNT films exhibited superior optoelectrical properties compared to SWCNT films prepared with conventional chemicals as well as surfactants. This indicates a correlation between degree of dispersibility and optoelectrical properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Solid catalysts play governing roles. Herein, the surface-disordered WO3, D-WO3, engineered with surface and sub-surface defective sites from NaBH4 reduction was proven to be an effective catalyst for H2O2 activation. The defective degree and defects amount on WO3 were regulated by NaBH4. More than 95% of two typical azo dyes, RhB and MG, were selectively degraded in D-WO3/H2O2 system during 3.0 h, while no significant activity was observed for MO as well as bisphenol A, roxarsone, phenol, 4-chlorophenol, p-nitrophenol, o-aminophenol, urea, and 2,4-dichlorophenol in comparison under the identical conditions (mainly less than 20%). Both ESR and radical scavenging tests indicated the minor role of center dot OH from H2O2 activation on D-WO3. The superior activity of D-WO3 could be mainly attributed to the surface and sub-surface defects with finely tailored local atomic configurations and electronic structures of central metal sites. Surface and sub-surface defective sites could serve as the reactive sites of interfacial adsorption, dissociative activation, and catalytic decomposition for both oxidant and pollutants, with high adsorption energy, strong structural activation, and superior catalytic activity. Our findings provided a new chance for non-selective radical catalysis based on transition metal oxides and a promising catalyst with high performance, low cost, and no toxicity for pollutant degradation with weak matrix effects in wastewater and surface water.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2020	27	2					1898	1911		10.1007/s11356-019-06899-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06899-w		NOV 2019						31760621					WOS:000500836700002
J	Das, S; Dalei, G				Das, Subhraseema; Dalei, Ganeswar			In situ forming dialdehyde xanthan gum-gelatin Schiff-base hydrogels as potent controlled release fertilizers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Controlled release fertilizer (CRF) hydrogels have blossomed into promising materials in agriculture owing to the sus-tained release of the fertilizer and also as soil conditioner. Apart from the traditional CRF hydrogels; Schiff-base hydrogels have garnered significant thrust that release nitrogen slowly in addition to reducing the environmental pol-lution. Herein, we have fabricated Schiff-base CRF hydrogels composed of dialdehyde xanthan gum (DAXG) and gel-atin. The formation of the hydrogels was accomplished via the simplistic in situ crosslinking reaction between the aldehyde groups of DAXG and the amino groups of gelatin. The hydrogels acquired a compact network upon increasing the DAXG content in the matrix. The phytotoxic assay on different plants indicated the hydrogels to be nontoxic. The hydrogels demonstrated good water-retention behaviour in soil, along with reusability even after 5 cycles. A controlled release profile for urea was evident from the hydrogels wherein macromolecular relaxation played a crucial role in the release mechanism. Growth assays on Abelmoschus esculentus (Okra) plant presented an intuitive evaluation on the growth and water-holding capacity of the CRF hydrogel. The present work demonstrated a facile preparation of CRF hydrogels to enhance the utilization of urea and retain soil humidity as fertilizer carriers.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 1	2023	875								162660	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162660		MAR 2023						36894095					WOS:000972570500001

The Enhancement of Metal-Binding Properties in Hemoglobin: The Role of Mild Damaging Factors	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												X-ray studies revealed the considerable enhancement of metal-binding properties in human hemoglobin under exposure to mild damaging factors (in the presence of 0.09 M urea or upon heating for 30 min at 50 degrees C). Changes in the element composition of the hemoglobin monolayer, formed on the water subphase in the Langmuir trough, have been monitored in real time by the total external reflection X-ray fluorescence measurements. X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been applied to study the local environment of zinc ions bound on hemoglobin molecules. According to these data, each zinc ion is coordinated by four ligands, two of which are cysteine and histidine. The oxidative stress has been found to accelerate extensively the enhancement of metal-binding ability in protein. A two-stage mechanism has been proposed as a possible explanation of the observed phenomenon: First, in the presence of the mild damaging agents, protein molecules can undergo a transition from the native conformation to a more labile intermediate state that increases the accessibility of amino acid residues (in particular cysteine). At the second stage, oxidation of cysteine and the subsequent activation of cysteine SH groups can affect markedly the protein-metal interaction. The presented investigations provide a deeper insight into the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders that excessive concentrations of the endogenic toxicants might trigger in an organism.

According to the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images, spherical ZnO particles can be seen along the g-C3N4 nanosheets. Additionally, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals the successful synthesis of the g-C3N4/ZnO. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalyst was tested for the decolorization of crystal violet (CV) as an organic refractory contaminant. The impacts of ZnO molar ratio, catalyst amount, CV concentration, and H2O2 concentration on CV degradation efficiency were investigated. The obtained outcomes conveyed that the ZnO molar ratio in the g-C3N4 played a prominent role in the degradation efficiency, in which the degradation efficiency reached 95.9% in the presence of 0.05 mmol of ZnO and 0.10 g/L of the catalyst in 10 mg/L of CV through 120 min under UV irradiation. Bare g-C3N4 was also tested for dye decolorization, and a 76.4% dye removal efficiency was obtained. The g-C3N4/ZnO was also tested for adsorption, and a 32.3% adsorption efficiency was obtained. Photocatalysis, in comparison to adsorption, had a dominant role in the decolorization of CV. Lastly, the results depicted no significant decrement in the CV degradation efficiency in the presence of the g-C3N4/ZnO photocatalyst after five consecutive runs.

J	Wang, CH; Wei, YH				Wang, Chih-Hao; Wei, Yau-Huei			Roles of Mitochondrial Sirtuins in Mitochondrial Function, Redox Homeostasis, Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												Mitochondria are the metabolic hubs that process a number of reactions including tricarboxylic acid cycle, beta-oxidation of fatty acids and part of the urea cycle and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs redox homeostasis and metabolic adaptation, leading to aging and metabolic disorders like insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5 belong to the sirtuin family proteins and are located at mitochondria and also known as mitochondrial sirtuins. They catalyze NAD(+)-dependent deacylation (deacetylation, demalonylation and desuccinylation) and ADP-ribosylation and modulate the function of mitochondrial targets to regulate the metabolic status in mammalian cells. Emerging evidence has revealed that mitochondrial sirtuins coordinate the regulation of gene expression and activities of a wide spectrum of enzymes to orchestrate oxidative metabolism and stress responses. Mitochondrial sirtuins act in synergistic or antagonistic manners to promote respiratory function, antioxidant defense, insulin response and adipogenesis to protect individuals from aging and aging-related metabolic abnormalities. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms by which mitochondrial sirtuins regulate oxidative metabolism and antioxidant defense and discuss the roles of their deficiency in the impairment of mitochondrial function and pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

Zinc oxide (ZnO) is considered as a promising catalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2. Herein, a series of ZnO electrocatalysts were prepared by a facile solvothermal method, whose structures were tuned by changing alkaline additives and molar ratios of zinc source/urea. The electrocatalytic property for CO2 reduction was explored in detail. Among them, the ZnO nanosheets selfassembled by ultrasmall nanoparticles prepared using urea (ZnO-UR) and the molar ratio (1:2) of zinc source/urea deliver the superior property with 88 % CO faradic efficiency at -0.95 V vs RHE in KHCO3 electrolyte. The outstanding property can be attributed to the rough surface, rich mesoporous structure, more activity sites and faster electron transfer. Moreover, boosted FECO (98 %) can be obtained in the KCl electrolyte at the same applied potential. This work provides a straightforward way to control the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of CO2RR through adjusting alkaline additives and contents.

Nitriding treatment could be used to enhance the NO reducibility of char waste. In this paper, char with nitriding treatment (nitriding char) was prepared from Shenhua char and urea. The effect of nitriding treatment on char reducing NO at high temperatures (700 ?-900 ?) was studied using a fixed-bed experimental system and various urea masses and pretreatment times. Increasing the urea mass and decreasing the pretreatment time resulted in more urea residue being present in the char, which increased the nitrogen complex which existed in the form of C(N) and caused the surface enrichment of nitrogen element, but blocked the pore structure. In an inert atmosphere, the NO reduction rates of all the nitriding chars were higher than that of the raw char, but there was an optimal limit parameter for the urea mass and pretreatment time. The presence of 2 vol% O-2 was not conducive to the NO reduction by nitriding char because of the higher char-nitrogen (char-N) content resulting from the nitriding treatment, which generated more NO and offset the benefit of the nitriding treatment. This paper provides a useful NO control strategy in coal-fired industrial boilers, and the relevant process route has achieved a 20%-35% decrease in NO emissions in engineering applications.					du, qian/GYJ-7090-2022	Ren, Xiaohan/0000-0003-2973-2793													1743-9671	1746-0220				OCT	2022	104						112	123		10.1016/j.joei.2022.07.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joei.2022.07.015		AUG 2022											WOS:000848792800006

The procedure relies on the preparation of C-erythrosyl N-alkylated nitrones 10 through reaction of aldehyde 8 and primary amines 13 followed by oxidation of the imines formed in situ with the methyltrioxo-rhenium catalyst and urea hydrogen peroxide. The addition of octylMgBr to nitrone 10e provided access to both epimeric hydroxylamines 21 and 22 with opposite configuration at the newly created stereocenter in a stereodivergent and completely stereoselective way, depending on the absence or presence of BF3 center dot Et2O. Final reductive amination and acetonide deprotection provided compounds 14 and 15 from low-cost D-mannose in remarkable 43 and 32% overall yields, respectively, over eight steps. The C-2 R-configured bis-alkylated trihydroxypiperidine 15 was the best ligand for GCase (IC50 = 15 mu M), in agreement with MD simulations that allowed us to identify the chair conformation corresponding to the best binding affinity.

The Ni/NiO/NCSs were prepared with in situ growth of Ni/NiO on the nitrogen doped carbon spheres. The morphology and composition of the materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS, respectively. The Ni/NiO/NCSs modified GCD electrode exhibited higher current response than that of nitrogen free counterpart and NiO/nitrogen carbon spheres for non-enzymatic oxidation of glucose in alkaline media. The amperometric measurement revealed that the sensor had wide linear regions of 2 mu M-600 mu M and 800 mu M-2500 mu M with a sensitivity of 219.19 mu A mM(-1)cm(-2) and 87.88 mu AmM(-1)cm(-2) respectively. Moreover, the Ni/NiO/NCS composites also exhibited good selectivity by adding certain amount of urea, NaCl, L-proline, L-valine, L-Leucine and ascorbic acid into 0.1 M NaOH solution. The excellent electrocatalytic performance may be attributed to the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and Ni loading, which may result in the increase of electron density and the enhancement of surface conductivity of the composite electrode materials.

Nitrogen originating from urea, NH4NO3, indole and polyaniline was doped into carbonaceous materials, including hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT-OH), large-inner thin-walled carboxylated carbon nanotubes (CNT-COOH) and graphite oxide (GO), to examine the catalytic effect. The NH4NO3-CNT-OH catalyst, which showed the best catalytic performance in 2,4,4'-HBP removal, was characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, Raman, BET surface area, XRD and XPS, and pyrrolic nitrogen was found to play a highly important role in the activation of PS. Under the conditions of [2,4,4'-HBP](0): [PS](0) = 1: 500, T = 25 degrees C, pH(0) = 7.0, concentration of catalyst = 100 mg L-1, 43.48 mu M 2,4,4'-HBP was completely removed in 2 h. According to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and radical quenching experiments, hydroxyl and sulfate radicals on the surface of the catalyst contributed to the substrate oxidation. Cleavage of C-C bridge bond, hydroxylation and polymerization were mainly involved in the oxidation process, leading to the formation of 10 intermediates (e.g., dimers), as detected by the MS/MS spectra.

Compared with no signal for the pristine MXene counterpart, the 18 h-treated sensors (N-MXene-18) achieved a detection limit of 200 ppb with an inspiring response that was 7.3% better than the existing MXeneinvolved reports thus far. Also, decent repeatability, stability, and selectivity were demonstrated. It is noteworthy that the N-MXene-18 sensors delivered a stronger response, more sufficient recovery, and quicker response/recovery speeds under a humid environment than those under dry conditions, proving the significance of humidity. Furthermore, to suppress the effect of the fluctuation of humidity on NH3 sensing during the tests, a commercial waterproof polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane was anchored onto the sensing layer, eventually bringing about humidity-independent features. Both nitrogen doping and TiO2 homojunctions constituted by mixed anatase and rutile phases were primarily responsible for the performance improvement with respect to pristine MXene. This work showcases the enormous potential of N-MXene materials in trace NH3 detection and offers an alternative strategy to realize both heteroatom doping and partial oxidation of MXene that is applicable in future optoelectronic devices.

Environmental factors can affect the distribution and activity of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM), including ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammoniaoxidizing archaea (AOA), and complete ammonia oxidizer (comammox Nitrospira). At present, most studies have used amoA as a marker gene for the ammonia oxidation process to analyze the differences among AOM community composition and abundance in the environment. In this study, metagenomic sequencing was used to study the differences in community composition and functional gene distribution of nitrifying microorganisms in the sediments of Lake Taihu with different eutrophication levels. It was found that comammox Nitrospira and typical nitrite oxidizer NOB Nitrospira, which belong to Nitrospirota, had higher relative abundance at most sites compared to AOB and AOA. Furthermore, the network analysis of genes related to nitrogen cycle showed that the main survival mode of nitrogen metabolizing microorganisms was mutualism. Besides, the microbial genomes in the sediments of Lake Taihu were reconstructed by metagenomic binning, which showed that among the 167 bins obtained, 2 bins (bin 9 and bin 32) were annotated as comammox Nitrospira, and had high abundance in the macrophytes-dominated lakes (such as South Lake Taihu and West Coast). In addition, bin 9, which belongs to comammox Nitrospira, annotates amoA genes associated with ammonia oxidation, and other genes associated with urea decomposition and transport, suggesting functional diversity. Overall, these findings suggest that AOM have different distribution characteristics, among which comammox Nitrospira has high diversity and may be potentially dominant in macrophytes-dominated lakes.

Highly Conductive Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Preparation by Direct Alignment on Substrates from Water Dispersions	LANGMUIR												A safe, scalable method for producing highly conductive aligned films of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) from water suspensions is presented. While microfluidic assembly of SWNTs has received significant attention, achieving desirable SWNT dispersion and morphology in fluids without an insulating surfactant or toxic superacid is challenging. We present a method that uniquely produces a noncorrosive ink that can be directly applied to a device in situ, which is different from previous fabrication techniques. Functionalized SWNTs (f-SWNTs) are dispersed in an aqueous urea solution to leverage binding between the amine group of urea and the carboxylic acid group of f-SWNTs and obtain urea-SWNT. Compared with SWNTs dispersed using conventional methods (e.g., superacid and surfactants), the dispersed urea-SWNT aggregates have a higher aspect ratio with a rodlike morphology as measured by light scattering. The Mayer rod technique is used to prepare urea-SWNT, highly aligned films (two-dimensional nematic order parameter of 0.6, 5 mu m spot size, via polarized Raman) with resistance values as low as 15-1700 O/sq in a transmittance range of 2-80% at 550 nm. These values compete with the best literature values for conductivity of SWNT-enabled thin films. The findings offer promising opportunities for industrial applications relying on highly conductive thin SWNT films.

Herein, a green and straightforward method for synthesizing small-sized porous thin g-C3N4 nanosheets directly from urea solution has been developed. This new photocatalyst can effectively remove 99.3% of rhodamine B within 15 min, exhibiting a degradation rate 16.8 times greater than that of conventionally synthesized bulk g-C3N4, under visible light irradiation. Additionally, this photocatalytic efficiency is comparable or even superior to that of previously reported literature, while requiring significantly less catalyst usage. From the experimental results, we have confirmed that the outstanding structural property as well as the stronger oxidizability of the valence-band holes (h+) are responsible for its greater photocatalytic activity. Its increased specific surface area and abundant pore structure significantly improve contaminant adsorption and charge separation and transfer. Meanwhile, the positive shift of the valence band enhances the oxidation of photogenerated h+, resulting in higher photocatalytic activity. This work can provide newly insights for designing highly efficient and easily-constructed g-C3N4 photocatalysts for practical photo -catalytic water treatment applications.																			0927-7757	1873-4359				AUG 20	2023	671								131600	10.1016/j.colsurfa.2023.131600	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2023.131600		MAY 2023											WOS:001012766300001

In order to realize their practical applications, highly efficient and inexpensive non-noble metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts are urgently required. Herein, we report a novel iron-chelated urea-formaldehyde resin hydrogel for the synthesis of Fe-N-C electrocatalysts. This novel hydrogel is prepared using a new instantaneous (20 s) one-step scalable strategy, which theoretically ensures the atomic-level dispersion of Fe ions in the urea-formaldehyde resin, guaranteeing the microstructural homogeneity of the electrocatalyst. Consequently, the prepared electrocatalyst exhibits higher catalytic activity and durability in the oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) reactions than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the above catalyst also shows a much better performance in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, including higher power density and better cycling stability. The developed synthetic approach opens up new avenues toward the development of sustainable active electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy devices.

Use of graphitic carbon nitrides as solar-light-driven photocatalysts for the reduction of p-nitrobenzoic acid	CATALYSIS TODAY												The use of graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C 3 N 4 ) as photocatalysts for the reduction of p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNBA) under simulated sunlight has been investigated. The photocatalysts were synthesized through the thermal polymerization of melamine and urea. The effects of the g-C 3 N 4 precursor employed in the synthesis, the thermal exfoliation treatment, the addition of sacrificial agents, and the pH conditions were evaluated. It was found that the presence of carboxylic acids as sacrificial electron donors was required to attain the photocatalytic reduction of PNBA, while amines or alcohols did not lead to any activity for this purpose. Furthermore, it was observed that the precursor used in the synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride had a slight influence on the photocatalytic activity, whereas the thermal treatment of the bulk g-C 3 N 4 materials exhibited a favourable effect. The best results were obtained upon addition of oxalic acid at pH = 3 using the carbon nitride exfoliated materials, achieving in these conditions the complete removal of PNBA after ca. 60 min of irradiation. Time resolved profiles of paminobenzoic acid (PABA) agree with an initial reduction of PNBA to form this compound, followed by oxidation of PABA by reactive oxygen species formed in the reaction medium.

Fe2O3 hollow nanorods/CNT composites as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												Oxygen evolution reaction is a key half reaction in overall water splitting process and metal air batteries. However, this reaction is kinetically unfavorable and requires a large overpotential when conducted in the absence of a precious metal catalyst. Substituting these precious metal catalysts with more abundant transition metal oxide such as Fe2O3 is a key challenge for widespread applications of water splitting. The catalytic activity of the Fe2O3 for water oxidation is mostly limited by the poor electric conductivity and low electrolyte permeability on catalyst surface. To overcome these limitations in this work, we have synthesized a composite between Fe2O3 nanorods and oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes via a simple urea assisted co-precipitation method. The Fe2O3 nanorods with hollow interior and low crystallinity provided improved electrochemically active surface area and larger number of transportation channels for diffusion of electrolyte. While, introduction of the carbon nanotube caused significant drop in resistance associated with faradic process. Consequently, the Fe2O3/carbon nanotube composite displayed excellent catalytic activity which is superior to Fe2O3, carbon nanotubes and their physical mixture. It is noted that the present work provides a simple strategy for the development of high performance oxygen evolution catalyst based on Fe2O3. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jana, J; Sharma, TSK; Chung, JS; Choi, WM; Hur, SH				Jana, Jayasmita; Sharma, Tata Sanjay Kanna; Chung, Jin Suk; Choi, Won Mook; Hur, Seung Hyun			The role of surface carbide/oxide heterojunction in electrocatalytic behavior of 3D-nanonest supported FeiMoj composites	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												In this work, we synthesized iron-molybdenum composites with carbide and oxide functionalities and studied their catalytic activities towards the electrolysis of water and urea. A 3D carbon nano-nest (CnN) was synthesized as the carbide source as well as stabilizing agent for the bimetallic composite. In two different synthetic pathways, CnN was used as a co-precursor with metal salts and pre-synthesized bi-metallic composite, respectively. The first path led to surface oxidized FeMo carbides (FMC-n) while the second path produced carbide corroborated FeMo-oxides (FM@C-n). The microscopic analyses indicated the presence of different metal phases with multivalency despite similar layered morphology. When used as electrode materials for water splitting and alkaline urea electrolysis, the materials showed different be-havior; viz., FM@C- 1 showed the lowest overpotential for HER of 63 and 60 mV, while FMC-1 showed the lowest overpotential for anodic OER (270 mV) and UOR (1.445 V) for 10 mA cm-2, respectively. The reaction mechanism depended on the nature of the catalyst surface as well as the constituents. It was observed that the hydrogen evolution reaction at cathode depended on the nature of catalyst surface (carbide surface predominated over oxide), while the anode reactions were affected by the nature of metal center, indicating the direct interaction of intermediates with metal surfaces. The courses of reactions were studied through different microscopic analyses and the high activity and stability of the materials could be attributed to the surface defects, multivalency, and carbon support.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

J	Campistol, J				Campistol, Jaume			Epilepsy in Inborn Errors of Metabolism With Therapeutic Options	SEMINARS IN PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY												Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are rare conditions that represent more than 1000 diseases, with a global prevalence of approximately 1:2000 individuals. Approximately, 40%-60% of IEM may present with epilepsy as one of the main neurologic signs. Epilepsy in IEM may appear at any age (fetal, newborn, infant, adolescent, or even adult). Different pathophysiological mechanisms may be responsible for the clinical phenotype, such as disturbances in energy metabolism (mitochondria) and fatty oxidation disorders, GLUT-1, and cerebral creatine deficiency), accumulation of complex molecules (lysosomal storage disorders), toxic mechanisms (organic acidurias and urea cycle disorders), or impairment of neurotransmission. Early diagnosis and, in some cases, an effective treatment may result in an excellent evolution of the IEM, in particularly seizure control. This review attempts to delineate a summary of IEM that may present with seizures or epilepsy and emphasizes the management in treatable conditions.

The structural morphologies were found to vary with the reaction time, calcination temperature and dosage of urea and the urea was verified to play an important role in the determination of the CeO2-ZrO2 composite nanostructures. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and other techniques. On the basis of the characterizations, it was proven that there existed migrations or movements during the hydrothermal process especially with long hydrothermal time and a possible mechanism was proposed which would go through a series of procedures of nucleation, Ostwald ripening and Kirkendall effect to account for the structural dynamics and morphological evolutions. Subsequently, the hybrid Ce0.9Zr0.1O2-GO was reduced by a hydrothermal method, which showed good adsorption for RhB.

Effect of La Doping on NiCr2O4 Properties and Catalytic Applications toward Decolorization of 4-Nitrophenol	ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												We report the successful synthesis of urea as a fuel for low-temperature microwave combustion-based synthesis of NiCr2O4 and La-doped NiCr2O4. Synthesis parameters include the kind of precursor, fuel, and container, as well as how external heat is provided to achieve the combustion reaction. Crystal structures, morphology, surface area, solar cells, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, and catalytic activity were used to characterize the products. No impurities phase formed in the as-synthesized NiCr2O4 sample, confirmed by XRD. Surface area was measured with a Brunauer-Emmet-Teller adsorption isotherm. Schottky and Frenkel formation energies have been investigated. This demonstrates the time needed for full decolorization of 4-Nitrophenol (yellow color) by NiCr2O4 and La-doped NiCr2O4. The La-doped NiCr2O4 (0.03%) showed the greatest catalytic activity compared to pristine and other La-doped NiCr2O4. The decolorization occurs in 10 min. The chemical hardness and surface area of the chromites appear to be important in determining catalytic performance. For multi oxide systems, the counter-doped ions in the A and B sites may alter the metal ion-oxide bond, promoting this partial oxidation process at the interface. The results suggest multiple research subjects focusing on such materials for the future.

The underlying pathogenesis is unknown although several mechanisms have been suggested. Renal failure causes oxidative stress leading to cardiovascular complications. It has been suggested as the potential mediator of uremic encephalopathy as well, but it is largely unknown whether brain tissue itself undergoes oxidative damage in uremia. The aim of our experiment was to analyze oxidative stress markers in different brain regions in an animal model of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI was induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury in male Wistar rats. Urine was collected in metabolic cages after 24 h. Samples of plasma and several brain regions were collected after 48 h. Markers of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and total antioxidant capacity were assessed. Renal failure was confirmed by high plasma creatinine, urea and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio. Our data confirmed increased systemic oxidative stress in the AKI group with plasma concentrations of markers of oxidative damage being twice as high compared to the sham-operated control group. No effect was seen in the urine. In the hippocampus, lipid and protein oxidation was higher, while antioxidant capacity was lower in the rats with AKI. Lipid oxidation markers in the frontal cortex were higher by 33%. No differences to controls were found in the cerebellum and hypothalamus. In conclusion, our results indicate that AKI leads to oxidative stress in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and in the frontal cortex. This kidney-brain crosstalk mediated by increased oxidative stress might explain some of the symptoms of uremic encephalopathy. The causes and consequences of oxidative damage observed in the brain during AKI remain to be elucidated.

J	Kazlauskas, R				Kazlauskas, Romas			Engineering more stable proteins	CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS												Protein function requires the folded protein form, but this form is unstable mainly because it readily unfolds into a flexible, unstructured form. Protein folding is favored by burying of hydrophobic side chains and hydrogen bonding between the amino acids. Protein unfolding is favored by the increase in conformational freedom of the main chain of amino acids upon unfolding. Protein stability is usually measured by the reversible unfolding of the protein with either heat or chemical additives like urea. Engineering mores stable proteins involves making substitutions that shift the folding-unfolding balance toward the folded form. Stabilizing substitutions can either stabilize the folded conformation or destabilize the unfolded ensemble. This tutorial emphasizes web-based tools to identify substitutions that stabilize proteins. Besides unfolding, other sources of protein instability are chemical modifications like oxidations or cleavage by proteases and aggregation of partly unfolded proteins into insoluble particles.

Improved Activity of PdO Supported over Co3O4 in the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction in a Wide pH Range	ENERGY & FUELS												Palladium(II) oxide supported over Co3O4 was studied as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, neutral, and alkaline solutions. Co3O4 has limited stability to an alkaline solution, while PdO stability goes from alkaline to slightly acidic pH. The combination of both materials was envisioned to improve the OER activity and stability in a wide range of electrolyte pH. Co3O4 and PdO@Co3O4 were synthesized by a solvothermal method using urea. PdO was deposited as small spheres on the surface of Co3O4 (8.9 wt % of Pd) and caused changes in the Co3O4 spinel structure as compared to the pure oxide, such as structural defects, change in morphology, decrease of the crystallite size, and increase of the surface area and Co3+/Co2+ ratio, and allowed the oxidation of Co4+ from Co3+. Furthermore, PdO@Co3O4 showed higher electrical conductivity, which contributed to the lower overpotential achieved at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) in all pH solutions. In pH 14, eta(10) for PdO@Co3O4 was 389, 46 mV lower than Co3O4. The superior OER activity after PdO@Co3O4 can be due to the lower charge-transfer resistance provided by the noble metal and by the higher electron-transfer kinetics shown by the lower Tafel slopes.

Following amendment with bovine (Bos taurus) urine (Bu) or urea (Ur), we measured inorganic N, pH, N2O, and genes associated with nitrification in two soils ('L' and 'W') having similar texture, pH, C, and C/N ratio. Solution-phase ammonia (slNH(3)) was also calculated accounting for non-linear ammonium (NH4+) sorption capacities (ASC). Soil W displayed greater nitrification rates and nitrate (NO3-) levels than soil L, but was more resistant to nitrite (NO2-) accumulation and produced two to ten times less N2O than soil L. Genes associated with NO2- oxidation (nxrA) increased substantially in soil W but remained static in soil L. Soil NO2- was strongly correlated with N2O production, and cumulative (c-) slNH(3) explained 87% of the variance in c-NO2-. Differences between soils were explained by greater slNH(3) in soil L which inhibited NO2- oxidization leading to greater NO2- levels and N2O production. This is the first study to correlate the dynamics of soil slNH(3), NO2-, N2O and nitrifier genes, and the first to show how ASC can regulate NO2- levels and N2O production.

Herein, a 3D nitrogen-doped porous carbon (3D-NPC) aerogel has been prepared by direct ink writing of a hydrogel containing agarose, urea, sodium chloride and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and subsequent freeze-drying and pyrolysis. The obtained 3D-printed aerogel exhibits multiple desirable properties including self-supportability, hierarchical porous structure, and good structural stability, and thus can be used as a mono-lithic catalytic filter in flow-through experiments. The 3D-NPC catalysts have demonstrated excellent PMS-based performances toward degradation of organic dyes and disinfection of bacterial culture. The degradation effi-ciency of Rhodamine B by 3D-NPC is as high as 97.2% within 5 min and the high degradation efficiency can be sustained for 5 h. Moreover, 100% inactivation of bacteria by 3D-NPC can also be maintained for at least 5 h, which far exceeds those of traditional catalysts. The key reactive species of the 3D-NPC + PMS system is found to be singlet oxygen in both Rhodamine B degradation and antibacterial disinfection, where the non-radical pathway contributes to the majority of the catalytic activity. Our work has innovatively presented a 3D-printed monolithic catalyst for efficient flow-through degradation and disinfection.

Cultivation and characterization of Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus exaquare, an ammonia-oxidizing archaeon from a municipal wastewater treatment system	ISME JOURNAL												Thaumarchaeota have been detected in several industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), despite the fact that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are thought to be adapted to low ammonia environments. However, the activity, physiology and metabolism of WWTP-associated AOA remain poorly understood. We report the cultivation and complete genome sequence of Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus exaquare, a novel AOA representative from a municipal WWTP in Guelph, Ontario (Canada). In enrichment culture, Ca. N. exaquare oxidizes ammonia to nitrite stoichiometrically, is mesophilic, and tolerates at least 15 mM of ammonium chloride or sodium nitrite. Microautoradiography (MAR) for enrichment cultures demonstrates that Ca. N. exaquare assimilates bicarbonate in association with ammonia oxidation. However, despite using inorganic carbon, the ammonia-oxidizing activity of Ca. N. exaquare is greatly stimulated in enrichment culture by the addition of organic compounds, especially malate and succinate. Ca. N. exaquare cells are coccoid with a diameter of similar to 1-2 mu m. Phylogenetically, Ca. N. exaquare belongs to the Nitrososphaera sister cluster within the Group I.1b Thaumarchaeota, a lineage which includes most other reported AOA sequences from municipal and industrial WWTPs. The 2.99 Mbp genome of Ca. N. exaquare encodes pathways for ammonia oxidation, bicarbonate fixation, and urea transport and breakdown. In addition, this genome encodes several key genes for dealing with oxidative stress, including peroxidase and catalase. Incubations of WWTP biofilm demonstrate partial inhibition of ammonia-oxidizing activity by 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), suggesting that Ca. N. exaquare-like AOA may contribute to nitrification in situ. However, CARD-FISH-MAR showed no incorporation of bicarbonate by detected Thaumarchaeaota, suggesting that detected AOA may incorporate nonbicarbonate carbon sources or rely on an alternative and yet unknown metabolism.

The Effect of TLR4 Blockade on Some Indicators of Systemic Inflammatory Response to Proteus mirabilis LPS in Rats	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE												The effects of TLR4 blocker on blood cell morphology, concentrations proinflammatory cytokines, and functional state of the liver and kidneys were studied in outbred male rats (n=60) after intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg LPS isolated from opportunistic Proteus mirabilis strain ATCC 51393. TLR4 blocker TLR4-IN-C34 was injected intravenously in a dose of 1 mg/kg/day over 3 days. Systemic inflammatory reaction induced by LPS was characterized by elevation of serum TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. Increased activity of hepatocyte enzymes (ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase), retention of nitrogen metabolites (urea and creatinine), elevated content of protein oxidation products, and enhanced protein catabolism were also observed. Administration of TLR4 blocker reduced parameters of inflammatory reaction and prevented the development of hypercatabolic syndrome; endotoxicosis and kidney function indicators approached the normal levels.

Hybridization Effects of Nitrogen-Doped Graphene-Carbon Nanotubes and Nano-Onion Carbons on the Electrocatalytic Activity of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction	ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nitrogen-doped graphene-carbon nanotubes (NG-NCNTs) were prepared from multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and then hybridized with nitrogen-doped nano-onions (NNOs) to fabricate a highly effective carbon-based electrocatalytic material for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The graphene oxide attached on the oxidized MWCNTs (GO-OCNTs), which was formed from the MWCNTs by an oxidation reaction with a strong acid, underwent nitrogen doping with urea to produce the NG-NCNTs. The content of oxygen of the GO-OCNTs was controlled by varying the oxidation time to produce NG-NCNTs with an optimal ORR activity. The NG-NCNTs prepared from GO-OCNTs and oxidized for 6 h showed the best ORR activity. The NG-NCNTs were hybridized with NNOs to further improve their ORR activity. The NNO aggregates were well dispersed among the NG-NCNTs by mixing, and significantly increased the specific surface area of the NG-NCNT/NNO hybrid. As a result, the NG-NCNT/NNO hybrid exhibited a better ORR activity than the NNOs and NG-NCNTs. The current density of the NG-NCNT/NNO hybrid was comparable to that of the platinum-based catalyst (Pt/C). A carbon-based catalyst with a high ORR activity and long-term stability could be produced by hybridizing NG-NCNTs and NNOs. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Sudrajat, H				Sudrajat, Hanggara			A one-pot, solid-state route for realizing highly visible light active Na-doped gC3N4 photocatalysts	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY												The visible light photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride (gC(3)N(4)), a promising metal-free photo catalytic material, is rather low, and is not as good as expected. Herein, to realize improved photocatalytic activity, sodium-doped gC3N4 (Na-gC(3)N(4)) is prepared through a novel solid-state process based on the thermal polycondensation of urea in the presence of sodium chloride and ammonium chloride. The proposed solid-state process is simple, requires no solvent, and provides a general route for rapid and large-scale synthesis of metal doped gC(3)N(4). The Na species exist in + 1 oxidation state and bind N atoms in the nitride ring of gC3N4. The photocatalytic activity improvement of gC3N4 for the mineralization of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) under visible light is seen after the Na doping. The improved photocatalytic activity is due to increased absorption of light, increased separation of charge carriers, stronger oxidation ability of valance band holes, and increased specific surface area. The typical photocatalytic activity of 0.6 wt% Na-gC(3)N(4) for the EE2 mineralization with an initial EE2 concentration of 1 mg/L and a catalyst concentration of 1 g/L is 95.7% within 2 h of visible light irradiation. Under identical experimental conditions, the EE2 mineralization by pristine gC(3)N(4) is only 23.5%.

In phosphate buffer without a supporting electrolyte, both metals were oxidised within a single voltammetric peak. The oxidation peak height was inversely proportional to the creatinine concentration, indicating adsorption of the species onto the particles. The adsorption followed a Langmuir isotherm with a free energy of adsorption estimated at - 14.4 kJ mol(-1). The adsorption was found to be selective in the presence of interferents such as glucose, glycine, and urea. Using the decrease in peak height creatinine could be calibrated with an LOD of 0.8 mM (defined as 3.3 & sigma;/S where & sigma; is the standard deviation of the blank and S is the calibration gradient) and a sensitivity of 137.0 & mu;A mM(-1) (r(2) = 0.998).

Tear metabolite changes in keratoconus	EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH												While efforts have been made over the years, the exact cause of keratoconus (KC) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to identify alterations in endogenous metabolites in the tears of KC patients compared with age-matched healthy subjects. Three groups were tested: 1) Age-matched controls with no eye disease (N = 15), 2) KC - patients wearing Rigid Gas permeable lenses (N = 16), and 3) KC - No Correction (N = 14). All samples were processed for metabolomics analysis using LC-MS/MS. We identified a total of 296 different metabolites of which >40 were significantly regulated between groups. Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis had significant changes, such as 3-phosphoglycerate and 1,3 diphosphateglycerate. As a result the citric acid cycle (TCA) was also affected with notable changes in Isocitrate, aconitate, malate, and acetylphosphate, up regulated in Group 2 and/or 3. Urea cycle was also affected, especially in Group 3 where ornithine and aspartate were up-regulated by at least 3 fold. The oxidation state was also severely affected. Groups 2 and 3 were under severe oxidative stress causing multiple metabolites to be regulated when compared to Group 1. Group 2 and 3, both showed significant down regulation in GSH-to-GSSG ratio when compared to Group 1. Another indicator of oxidative stress, the ratio of lactate - pyruvate was also affected with Groups 2 and 3 showing at least a 2-fold up regulation. Overall, our data indicate that levels of metabolites related to urea cycle, TCA cycle and oxidative stress are highly altered in KC patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we propose a new method to efficiently remove urine, simultaneously eliminate ECs, and control the generation of toxic chlorate during urine treatment using a photoelectrocatalytic-chlorine (PEC-Cl) system. A type-II heterojunction of WO3/BiVO4 was used as a photoanode to generate chlorine radicals (Cl center dot) by decreasing the oxidation potential of WO3 valence band for the highly selective conversion of urine to N-2 and the simultaneous degradation of ECs in an efficient manner. The method presented surprising results. It was observed that the amount of toxic chlorate was significantly inhibited by circumventing the over-oxidation of Clby holes or hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). Moreover, the removal of urea nitrogen reached 97% within 90 min, while the degradation rate of trimethoprim in urine was above 98.6% within 60 min, which was eight times more than that in the PEC system (12.1%). Compared to the bare WO3 photoanode, the toxic chlorate and nitrate generated by the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode decreased by 61% and 44%, respectively. Thus, this study provides a safe, efficient, and environmentally-friendly approach for the disposal of urine. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To overcome these drawbacks, a self-modification strategy of one-step formaldehyde-assisted thermal polycondensation of molten urea to prepare carbon-deficient and oxygen-doped g-C3N4 (V-C-OCN) is developed, and the carbon vacancy concentration is well-controlled by changing formaldehyde dosage. The V-C-OCN catalysts exhibit interesting carbon vacancy concentration-dependent photocatalytic removal efficiency to p-nitrophenol (PNP) and atrazine (ATN), in which V-C-OCN15 with appropriate carbon vacancy concentration displays significantly higher pollutant removal efficiency than bulk g-C3N4. The apparent first-order rate constant of V-C-OCN15 for PNP and ATN removal is 4.4 and 5.2 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. A combination of the experimental results and theoretic calculations confirm that the synergetic effect of carbon vacancies and oxygen doping sites can not only delay the recombination of charge carriers but also facilitate adsorption of oxygen molecules on the carbon vacancies, which leads to the generation of plentiful active oxygen species including not only superoxide anion radicals but also indirectly formed hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen. These active oxygen species play a dominant role in the removal of target pollutants.					zhang, xueyan/GQI-1800-2022; meng, jiaqi/LDG-6957-2024	Liu, Yunqing/0000-0002-2613-7967; Zhang, Xueyan/0009-0005-1995-399X													1616-301X	1616-3028				MAY	2021	31	20							2010763	10.1002/adfm.202010763	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202010763		MAR 2021											WOS:000627917000001

The rates of the one-pot catalyst-free transformations of steroidal beta-ketoaldehydes, ammonium acetate and substituted benzaldehydes in EtOH were found to be affected slightly by the steric and electronic feature of the substituents on the aromatic ring of the arylaldehyde component and the different reactivities of rings D and A of the sterane core. At the same time, the acid-catalyzed Biginelli-type reaction of dihydrotestosterone acetate, urea and arylaldehydes, and subsequent Jones oxidation of the primarily formed dihydropyrimidinones led to the corresponding ring A-fused 1H-pyrimidin-2-ones in moderate yields independently of the substituents on the aromatic moiety. The synthesized compounds were tested in vitro on human cancer cell lines as well as on non-cancerous fibroblast cells by the MIT assay in order to investigate their biological effects. As a result of the pharmacological screen, a remarkable structure-function relationship has been observed as the acetylated Biginelli products exhibited higher toxicity compared to the deacetylated version of each compound.

The rate-limiting enzyme tyrosinase is crucial for controlling melanin production, and is a well-known biomarker closely associated with the level of malignancy. However, effective probes for detecting tyrosinase in living cells are currently lacking. This paper describes the design, synthesis and characterization of F2, a high sensitive type of "turn-on" fluorescent probe for imaging living melanoma cells. F2 could be activated by tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation followed by hydrolysis of a urea linkage. The results demonstrate that F2 displays cyan fluorescence when activated by tyrosinase, and has sufficient sensitivity and selectivity to detect tyrosinase in aqueous solution and in living cells. F2 has potential for the noninvasive real-time diagnosis and tracking of melanoma. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The detailed characterization results evidence the formation of a unique atomic-level heterojunction contact interface via Ti-N coordination bonds in TiO2/VC-CN, in which N atoms around the C vacancies of g-C3N4 donate electrons to unoccupied Ti 3d orbitals of TiO2. At the optimal TiO2 doping level, the TiO2/VC-CN het-erojunctions exhibit remarkably high visible-light photocatalytic oxidation performance in the degradation of recalcitrant phenolic pollutants, methylparaben and acetaminophen, which outperforms commercially available P25 TiO2, as-prepared anatase TiO2 and bulk g-C3N4. The experimental results combined with theoretic calcu-lations reveal that the outstanding interfacial Ti-N coordination bonding remarkably boosts the direct Z-scheme charge carrier transfer in the TiO2/VC-CN heterojunctions, which results in the generation of plentiful reactive oxidation species including O-center dot(2)-, (OH)-O-center dot and O-1(2) for efficient removal of the target pollutants.					meng, jiaqi/LDG-6957-2024; Yang, Juan/P-4525-2014; zhang, xueyan/GQI-1800-2022	Liu, Yunqing/0000-0002-2613-7967; Zhang, Xueyan/0009-0005-1995-399X													0169-4332	1873-5584				MAR 30	2023	614								156118	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.156118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.156118		DEC 2022											WOS:000910683600001

It can induce nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity via oxidative stress. Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is known for its antioxidant properties. In this study, we used captopril for ameliorating of Dz-induced kidney and brain toxicity in rats. Animals were divided into five groups as follows: negative control (olive oil), Dz (150 mg kg(-1)), captopril (60 and 100 mg kg(-1)) and positive control (N-acetylcysteine 200 mg kg(-1)) were injected intraperitoneally 30 min before Dz. After 24 h, animals were anesthetized and the brain and kidney tissues were separated. Then oxidative stress factors were evaluated. Also, blood was collected for assessment of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) and nitric oxide (NO) levels. Dz significantly increased oxidative stress markers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonyl as well as glutathione (GSH) oxidation in both tissues. Increased levels of the BUN, Cr and NO were observed after Dz injection. Interestingly, captopril administration significantly decreased ROS production in both tissues. Captopril significantly protected kidney and brain against lipid peroxidation and GSH oxidation. Administration of captopril could markedly inhibit protein carbonyl production in kidney and brain after Dz injection. Furthermore, captopril ameliorated the increased level of BUN, Cr and NO. These results suggested that captopril can prevent Dz-induced oxidative stress, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity because of its antioxidant activity.

Here, a heteropolyacid-functionalized hybrid nanomaterial (NiFe2O4@SiO2-DETA@POM) was prepared and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction patterns (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and the electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The synthesized hybrid nanostructure was used as a solid nanocatalyst in oxidative desulfurization (ODS) of real fuel and simulated gasoline samples. The ODS process of benzothiophene (BT) and dibenzothiophene (DBT) as model compounds in the presence of NiFe2O4@SiO2-DETA@POM and by using urea-hydrogen peroxide/acetic acid as a safer oxidizing agent was investigated. A good result was obtained by removing 97% of benzothiophene and 98% of dibenzothiophene. Also, 96% of the sulfur compounds were eliminated when the ODS process was tested on a real crude oil sample (600 ppm) under an optimized dosage of nanocatalyst, urea-hydrogen peroxide/acetic acid (0.1 g, 1 g/4 ml) at 50 oC for 60 min. NiFe2O4@SiO2-DETA@POM could be recycled for five consecutive oxidation runs without significant deterioration in its catalytic activity. The UHP's safety and efficiency as an oxidant, high removal efficacy, short transformation times, easy workup procedure, catalyst reusability, simple separation of nanocatalyst, green conditions, and environmental compatibility and sustainability. The obtained results prove that NiFe2O4@SiO2-DETA@POM is a suitable and efficient hybrid catalyst for the oxidative desulfurization of simulated and real fuels.

J	Rodgers, RL				Rodgers, Robert L.			A reappraisal of the role of cyclic AMP in the physiological action of glucagon	PEPTIDES												Effects of the metabolic hormone glucagon can be physiological or supraphysiological, based on agonist concentration and the mediating cellular signal. The threshold concentration (TC) for activating the AC/cAMP signal pathway in liver is >= 100 pM. By contrast, mean plasma concentrations are around 20-45 pM, depending on the vascular bed. Accordingly, effects produced at TCs below 100 pM are physiological and mediated by cellular signal pathways other than AC/cAMP. Effects generated at concentrations above 100 pM are supraphysiological, often mediated by simultaneous activation of cAMP-independent and -dependent pathways. Physiological responses, and their established or implicated signal pathways, include stimulation of: glucose mobilization, fatty acid oxidation, and urea synthesis in liver (PLC/IP3/Ca2+/CaM); lipolysis in white and brown adipose tissue and oxygen consumption in brown adipose of the rat but not in humans (PLC/IP3/Ca2+/CaM); renal potassium and phosphate excretion in rodents and GFR in humans (signal undetermined); and glucose utilization in rat heart (PI3K/akt). Supraphysiological responses involve the AC/cAMP pathway and include: enhanced stimulation of glucose mobilization and stimulation of urea synthesis in liver; further stimulation of white and brown adipose lipolysis and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue; stimulation of renal Cl-transport; and increased rat heart contractility. The AC/cAMP pathway is likely recruited when plasma glucagon rises above 100 pM during periods of elevated metabolic stress and systemic glucose demand, such as in the early neonate or strenuously exercising adult. The current cAMP-centered model should therefore be reconsidered and replaced with one that places more emphasis on cAMP-independent pathways.																			0196-9781	1873-5169				JAN	2023	159								170296	10.1016/j.peptides.2022.170906	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2022.170906		DEC 2022						36396082					WOS:000934013300001

In the SCR process, NOx react with ammonia (NH3) to form nitrogen and water vapor. The reaction is influenced by several variables, including stored ammonia on the catalyst, exhaust gas composition, and catalyst temperature. Currently, measurements from NOx and/or NH3 sensors upstream and downstream of the SCR are used with predictive models to estimate ammonia storage levels on the catalyst and control urea dosing. This study investigated a radio frequency (RF)-based method to directly monitor the ammonia storage state of the SCR. This approach utilizes the catalyst as a cavity resonator, in which an RF antenna excites electromagnetic waves within the cavity to monitor changes in the catalyst state. Ammonia storage causes changes in the dielectric properties of the catalyst, which directly impacts the RF signal. Changes in the RF signal relative to stored ammonia (NH3) were evaluated over a wide range of frequencies, temperatures, and exhaust conditions. The RF response to NH3 storage, desorption, and oxidation on the SCR was well correlated with changes in the catalyst state. Calibrated RF measurements demonstrate the ability to monitor the adsorption state of the SCR to within 10% of the sensor full scale. The results indicate direct measurement of SCR ammonia storage levels, and resulting catalyst feedback control, via RF sensing to have significant potential for optimizing the SCR system to improve NOx conversion and decrease urea consumption.

They derive energy for carbon fixation and growth from nitrification-the aerobic oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and further to nitrate-and are proposed to play essential roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycling of sponge holobionts. In this study, we characterize two novel nitrifying symbiont lineages, Candidatus Nitrosokoinonia and Candidatus Nitrosymbion in the marine sponge Coscinoderma matthewsi using a combination of molecular tools, in situ visualization, and physiological rate measurements. Both represent anew genus in the ammonia- oxidizing archaeal class Nitrososphaeria and the nitrite-oxidizing bacterial order Nitrospirales, respectively. Furthermore, we show that larvae of this viviparous sponge are densely colonized by representatives of Ca . Nitrosokoinonia and Ca . Nitrosymbion indicating vertical transmission. In adults, the representatives of both symbiont genera are located extracellularly in the mesohyl. Comparative metagenome analyses and physiological data suggest that ammonia-oxidizing archaeal symbionts of the genus Ca . Nitrosokoinonia strongly rely on endogenously produced nitrogenous compounds (i.e. ammonium, urea, nitriles/cyanides, and creatinine) rather than on exogenous ammonium sources taken up by the sponge. Additionally, the nitrite-oxidizing bacterial symbionts of the genus Ca . Nitrosymbion may reciprocally support the ammonia-oxidizers with ammonia via the utilization of sponge-derived urea and cyanate. Comparative analyses of published environmental 16S rRNA gene amplicon data revealed that Ca . Nitrosokoinonia and Ca . Nitrosymbion are widely distributed and predominantly associated with marine sponges and corals, suggesting a broad relevance of our findings. [Graphics]					Engelberts, J.

Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapeutic drug whose nephrotoxic effect is a major complication and a dose-limiting factor for antitumoral therapy. There is much evidence that inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. We found that cilastatin, a renal dehydropeptidase-I inhibitor, has protective effects in vitro and in vivo against cisplatin-induced renal damage by inhibiting apoptosis and oxidation. Here, we investigated the potential use of cilastatin to protect against cisplatin-induced kidney injury and inflammation in rats. Methods. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, cilastatin-control, cisplatin and cilastatin-cisplatin. Nephrotoxicity was assessed 5 days after administration of cisplatin based on blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 and renal morphology. Inflammation was measured using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, immunohistochemical studies and evaluation of inflammatory mediators. Results. Compared with the control rats, cisplatin-administered rats were affected by significant proximal tubule damage, decreased GFR, increased production of inflammatory mediators and elevations in urea, creatinine and tissue KIM-1 levels. Cilastatin prevented these changes in renal function and ameliorated histological damage in cisplatin-administered animals. Cilastatin also reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and CD68-positive cell concentrations. Conclusions. Cilastatin reduces cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, which is associated with decreased inflammation in vivo. Although the exact role of decreased inflammation in nephroprotection has not been fully elucidated, treatment with cilastatin could be a novel strategy for the prevention of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.

Green synthesis of a novel flower-like cerium vanadate microstructure for electrochemical detection of tryptophan in food and biological samples	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												In this present investigation, we introduced a novel electrochemical sensor for the detection of tryptophan (TRP) based on green pompoms flower-like cerium vanadate (CeVO4). The flower-like CeVO4 microstructure was prepared by the simple hydrothermal treatment with the assistance of urea for the first time. The as-prepared flower-like CeVO4 microstructure was characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies. The electrochemical properties are evaluated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). As an electrochemical sensor, the green pompoms flower-like CeVO4 modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) displayed an excellent electrocatalytic activity for the detection of TRP. The obtained electrochemical results revealed that the oxidation of TRP, exhibited a lower potential and higher anodic peak current when compared to unmodified GCE. These results were suggested that the flower-like CeVO4/GCE have a good electrocatalytic activity towards the TRP oxidation. The flower-like CeVO4 sensor exhibited the wide linear concentration range and low detection limit of 0.1-94 mu M and 0.024 mu M respectively. Finally, the proposed sensor was successfully applied to the determination of TRP in real sample analysis such as food and biological samples with satisfied recoveries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Cyanate, known as uremic toxin, is an electrophile produced spontaneously from urea or by myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate. Herein, we explored metabolic effects of cyanate in normal chow diet (NCD)- and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Mice were treated with cyanate (1 mg/mL in drinking water) and fed NCD or HFD. Peritoneal glucose tolerance test (PGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations were determined. Kidney and liver tissues were analyzed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid accumulations. Human albumin was carbamylated and evaluated for ROS scavenging activities. Contrary to our expectations, we found that cyanate treatment improved increased insulin sensitivity and alleviated hepatic steatosis in NCD- and HFD-fed mice. PGTT and ITT revealed faster and immediate glucose clearance in cyanate-treated NCD- and HFD-fed mice. Histological analysis of kidney and serum levels of BUN and creatinine showed no significant differences between cyanate-treated and control mice groups. Cyanate treatment reduced appetite and body weight in both NCD- and HFD-fed mice groups. Cyanate also decreased lipid peroxidation levels in the sera and the kidney, attenuated ROS levels in the kidney, which lead us to the findings that cAlb significantly reduced ROS levels compared to Alb in Caki-1 kidney and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The results in this study may indicate that cyanate improves insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis possibly via exerting anorexic and antioxidative effects.

Female rats were randomly divided into four groups: group I (control) was given a normal diet, group II (positive control, S) received a diet enriched with spirulina, group III received only lead through drinking water (Pb), and group IV received both a diet enriched with spirulina and lead contaminated water (S Pb). The treatment of pregnant rats with lead administrated in drinking water, from the 5(th) day of pregnancy until day 14 after delivery, induced an increased level of renal lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl, hydrogen peroxide and advanced oxidation protein product, a decreased renal content of glutathione and antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in newborns. A statistically significant increase of renal DNA, mRNA, hematological parameters as well as in plasma urea and creatinine serum levels and lactate dehydrogenase was seen in pups, while those of uric acid declined. Interestingly, these biochemical modifications were accompanied by a significant decrease of lactate dehydrogenase in kidney, plasma alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl-transpeptidase levels, urinary levels of creatinine and urea. Conversely, supplementation of lead-treated mother's with spirulina alleviated hematotoxicity induced by lead as evidenced, by restoring the biochemical markers cited above to near normal levels. Nevertheless, the distorted histoarchitecture in rat kidney attenuated following spirulina supplementation. It can be then concluded that spirulina is an important protective source against kidney impairments.					elfeki, abdelfattah/LKL-6561-2024; magne, christian/AAD-6357-2021	elfeki, abdelfattah/0009-0009-9949-1367; GARGOURI, Manel/0000-0002-1803-3308													1611-2156						2018	17						215	232		10.17179/excli2017-1016	http://dx.doi.org/10.17179/excli2017-1016								29743860					WOS:000427086900002

Leveraging electrochemistry to uncover the role of nitrogen in the biological reactivity of nitrogen-doped graphene	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO												While nitrogen doping greatly broadens graphene applications, relatively little is known about the influence of this heteroatom on the biological activity of graphene. A set of systematically modified nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) materials was synthesized using the hydrothermal method in which the degree of N-doping and N-bonding type is manipulated using two nitrogen precursors (urea and uric acid) and different thermal annealing temperatures. The bioactivity of the NG samples was evaluated using the oxidation of the intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and bacterial viability (of Escherichia coli K12), and oxidative stress was identified as the predominant antibacterial mechanism. Two key energy-relevant electrochemical reactions, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), were used to characterize the influence of different N-types on the electronic properties of the NG materials. Electron-donating graphitic-N and electron-withdrawing pyridinic-N were identified as effective promoters for ORR and OER, respectively. The similar mechanisms between the GSH oxidation (indicative of oxidative stress) and ORR mechanisms reveal the role of graphitic-N as the active site in oxidative stress related bioactivity, independent of other consequential properties (e.g., defect density, surface area). This work advances a growing rational design paradigm for graphene family materials using chemical composition and further provides valuable insight into the performance-hazard tradeoffs of NG applications in related fields.					; Wang, Yan/E-5609-2017; Tan, Susheng/HZL-0015-2023	Aquino de Carvalho, Nathalia/0000-0002-9568-5350; Wang, Yan/0000-0002-9147-1136; Tan, Susheng/0000-0002-6162-7443; Gilbertson, Leanne M/0000-0003-3396-4204													2051-8153	2051-8161				DEC 1	2019	6	12					3525	3538		10.1039/c9en00802k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9en00802k													WOS:000501324000017

Controlled synthesis and electrochemical characterization of Co3V2O8 hexagonal sheets for energy storage applications	COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS												This work explores the hydrothermal synthesis of Co3V2O8 hexagonal sheets and their effects on the structure and electrochemical properties of the electrode material, with a focus on various urea concentrations. The prepared materials were extensively characterized through a variety of imaging and electrical techniques, such as asymmetric supercapacitor studies, cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Morphological analyses revealed that distinct hexagonal sheets formed based on the urea content. XPS analysis has provided information about the oxidation states and chemical composition of the produced materials. The high capacitance of 293 F/g with an energy density of 14.68 Wh/kg at an applied current density of 1 mA/cm2 over CVO0.6MU sample demonstrates the electrochemical capabilities of hexagonal sheets of Co3V2O8 as electrode materials for supercapacitor, as demonstrated by electrochemistry research such as GCD, CV, and EIS. Furthermore, we were able to attain a high capacitive retention of approximately 99 % columbic efficiency up to 20,000 cycles, as well as a high power density exceeding CVO-0.6MU, or 142 W/kg. These findings showed how highly feasible our as-synthesized CVO-0.6MU electrode material is as an energy storage device. The research carried out on asymmetric supercapacitor provides more evidence of the stable and promising capacitive performance of the synthetic materials, Additionally effect of the temperature on ASC were studied. This extensive work offers crucial details regarding the electrochemical characteristics and regulated manufacture of Co3V2O8 hexagonal sheets, which may find application in future cutting-edge energy storage technologies.

The effects of the Ru-III(edta) concentration, reaction temperature, initial solution pH, oxygen concentration, inlet NO concentration, and liquid-to-gas ratio on denitration performance were examined. The results indicated that Ru-III(edta) showed excellent denitration performance at low concentrations and that an increase in the concentration of Ru-III(edta) resulted in an increase in NO removal efficiency. In addition, NO removal efficiency increased to its optimum value at first and then declined as both the reaction temperature and initial solution pH rose. The optimal reaction temperature and ideal initial solution pH were determined to be 45 degrees C and 5.0 respectively. The suitable liquid-to-gas ratio was found to be 51.5 L/m(3). NO removal efficiency was less affected by the oxygen concentration in the range of 0-12% due to a superior anti-oxidation performance at pH = 5.0. Furthermore, the NO removal efficiency decreased significantly as the inlet NO concentration increased. The addition of 5 wt% urea to an aqueous solution of Ru-III(edta) enhanced denitration performance, and an Ru-III(edta) and urea mixed solution were able to exceed 65.07% NO removal efficiency within 30 min under optimal experimental conditions. This work proposed an alternative absorbent for NO removal and provided fundamental data for industrial denitration with Ru-III(edta) absorbents.

The present study investigates the toxic effects after combined exposure to these toxicants on: (i) oxidative stress during combined chronic exposure to aluminum and acrylamide on kidney function (ii) correlation of oxidative stress with metallothionein (MT) and inflammatory cytokines expression, DNA damage, and histopathological changes. Rats were exposed to aluminum (50 mg/kg body weight) in drinking water and acrylamide (20 mg/kg body weight) by gavage either individually or in combination for 3 weeks. Exposure rats to aluminum chloride or acrylamide alone and in combination induced nephrotoxicity, as evidenced by a decrease in the 24-h urine volume and uric acid levels in plasma and an increase of plasma creatinine, urea, and blood urea nitrogen levels. Nephrotoxicity was objectified by a significant increase in malondialdehyde level, advanced oxidation protein, and protein carbonyl contents, whereas reduced glutathione, nonprotein thiol, vitamin C levels, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities showed a significant decline. Superoxide dismutase activity and its gene expression were increased. Aluminum and acrylamide co-exposure exhibited synergism in various biochemical variables and also in DNA damage. Kidney total MT levels and genes expression of MT1, MT2, and proinflammatory cytokines were increased. All these changes were supported by histopathological observations. Co-exposure to aluminum and acrylamide exhibited synergism and more pronounced toxic effects compared with their individual effects based on various biochemical variables, genotoxic, and histopathological changes.

However, the applications of pristine g-C3N4 are subject to the high recombination of electron-hole pairs and low solar utilization. This study aimed to develop a unique and effective method to synthesize oxygen-doped g-C3N4 with enhanced photocatalytic activity for pollutant treatment.RESULTSOxygen-doped g-C3N4 photocatalysts (CN(M), CN(E), CN(I), and CN(P)) were successfully synthesized via the thermal polycondensation of a novel supramolecular precursor based on urea and monobasic alcohol, in which the urea and alcohol solvent can fully interact through a cross-linking network fabricated by H-bonding. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited enhanced catalytic activity compared with g-C3N4 on the photocatalytic oxidation of sulfanilamide antibiotics (SMR). The structure of alcohol has an influence on the amount of oxygen doping and on the catalytic activity of oxygen-doped g-C3N4; the optimized photocatalytic performance was achieved on CN(I). By combining characterization results, the improved catalytic activity was mainly ascribed to a certain amount of highly electronegative O atoms being doped into the tri-s-triazine units of g-C3N4, which can optimize the basic chemical structure, thus improving light-harvesting and increasing the separation rate of electron-hole pairs. In addition, trapping experiments indicated that & BULL;O-2(-) is the main active species in the photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethazine.CONCLUSIONThis work provides a facile and efficient approach for the fabrication of an O doped g-C3N4 catalyst with promising photocatalytic performance on SMR degradation.

We herein report the results of comparative metagenome analyses on methylobacterial communities of soybean plants grown in an experimental field in Tohoku University (Kashimadai, Miyagi, Japan). Methylobacterium was identified as the most dominant genus (33%) among bacteria inhabiting soybean stems. We classified plant-derived Methylobacterium species into Groups I, II, and III based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, and found that Group I members (phylogenetically close to M. extorquens) were dominant in soybean-associated Methylobacterium. By comparing 29 genomes, we found that all Group I members possessed a complete set of genes for the N-methylglutamate pathway for methylamine utilization, and genes for urea degradation (urea carboxylase, urea amidolyase, and conventional urease). Only Group I members and soybean methylobacterial isolates grew in a culture supplemented with methylamine as the sole carbon source. They utilized urea or allantoin (a urea-related compound in legumes) as the sole nitrogen source; however, group III also utilized these compounds. The utilization of allantoin may be crucial in soybean-bacterial interactions because allantoin is a transported form of fixed nitrogen in legume plants. Soybean-derived Group I strain AMS5 colonized the model legume Lotus japonicus well. A comparison among the 29 genomes of plant-derived and other strains suggested that several candidate genes are involved in plant colonization such as csgG (curli fimbriae). Genes for the N-methylglutamate pathway and curli fimbriae were more abundant in soybean microbiomes than in rice microbiomes in the field. Based on these results, we discuss the lifestyle of Methylobacterium in the legume phyllosphere.

Shock waves exposed α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles for electrochemical sensing of riboflavin, uric acid and folic acid	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL												Multi-analyte detection has become an increasingly important need for on-line and in-situ monitoring in food process, biomedical and environmental monitoring industries due to its advantages like minimum sample and time requirement for analysis, improved functionality, and portability of the devices. Here, we report a novel electrochemical sensor based on shock wave treated Iron (III) oxide (alpha-Fe2O3) nanoparticles for simultaneous detection of Riboflavin (RF), Uric acid (UA), and Folic acid (FA). The alpha-Fe2O3 NPs were synthesized by the sol-gel method and modified by exposing shock waves (50,100,150 pulses) with a time interval of 3 s. Both the pristine and modified nanoparticles were characterized by powder XRD, HRTEM, XPS, Raman, and Photoluminescence spectroscopy. Glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) have been modified with the alpha-Fe(2)O(3)NPs and their electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of RF, UA, and FA has been investigated in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. Among various electrodes, the alpha-Fe2O3 NPs exposed to 150 shock waves exhibited sharp oxidation peaks at -0.45 V, 0.4 V, and 0.8 V corresponding to oxidation of RF, UA, and FA respectively. The fabricated sensor responded selectively over wider dynamic ranges of 0.11 to 624 mu M for RF, 0.11 to 722 mu M for UA, and 0.11 to 691 mu M for FA with the corresponding detection limits of 26, 18, and 25 nM respectively. For simultaneous determination, the SWV oxidation peak currents increased proportionally with the increase in the concentration over the range of 0.111 to 397 mu M, with the relatively better LODs of 11, 14, and 16 nM for RF, UA, and FA. The influence of 100-fold excess of ascorbic acid, sucrose, thiamine (Vit.B1), urea, glucose, NaCl, KCl, histamine, ammonia, acetylcholine, ascorbic acid, and L-tyrosine were tested on the SWV response in the presence of riboflavin, uric acid, and folic acid. Applicability of the fabricated electrode has been tested using vitamin tablets and human urine as real samples.

Determination of Nicotine in Human Saliva Using Electrochemical Sensor Modified with Green Synthesized Silver Nanoparticles Using Phyllanthus reticulatus Fruit Extract	CRYSTALS												In this study, for the first time, Phyllanthus Reticulatus fruit extract was utilized as a reducing agent in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). For sample analysis, a number of approaches were employed. The synthesized Ag-NPs have a spherical shape and a homogeneous in size. The well-known crystal structure and optical energy absorption spectrum of Ag-NPs were respectively revealed by the XRD and UV-VIS analysis. This new method is simple and eco-friendly for producing silver and other noble metals in large quantities. The Ag-NPs modified glassy carbon electrode was prepared for nicotine oxidation which indicated that Ag NPs had the ability to enhance the electron transfer rate of the oxidation process. In 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH of 7.4), a significant increase in the oxidation peak current of nicotine was observed at the modified electrode. Cyclic voltammetry, amperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterizations showed that Ag-NPs had better electrocatalytic performance toward nicotine (NIC) oxidation with good stability, and selectivity. This sensor showed a linear response with the concentration of NIC in the range of 2.5 to 105 mu M. The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 0.135 mu M. The interference analysis was carried out on the Ag-NPs/GCE with various molecules like acetic acid, ascorbic acid, calcium chloride, glucose, magnesium chloride, urea, and uric acid. Hence, these molecules did not interfere with NIC detection, indicating a perfect selectivity of Ag-NPs/GCE. Moreover, the Ag-NPs/GCE sensor was effectively applied to detect NIC in a real-world sample (saliva) of a tobacco chewer. Furthermore, the Ag-NPs/GCE sensor exhibited very good stability and repeatability in human saliva samples. Finally, Ag-NPs/GCE was also successfully applied to detect spiked nicotine in saliva samples with high recovery value, indicating its high accuracy and effectiveness in NIC analysis.

J	Aali, H; Mollazadeh, S; Khaki, JV				Aali, H.; Mollazadeh, S.; Khaki, J. Vahdati			Quantitative evaluation of ambient O2 interference during solution combustion synthesis process:considering iron nitrate - fuel system	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL												The interference of ambient oxygen in the solution combustion synthesis of metastable/nonstable compounds is a considerable factor which has been a challenge for synthesizing of such compounds in a single-phase state. Accordingly, evaluation of the amount of oxygen interference in the synthesis process would provide a better insight through the production of metastable compounds using the SCS method. In the current research, iron nitrate-fuel(s) system was selected as the model to estimate the amount of the interference of ambient oxygen in the synthesis process. For this purpose, synthesis of three different compositions of iron oxides i.e. 100 mol % Fe3O4, 80 mol % Fe3O4-20 mol % FeO, and 50 mol % Fe3O4-50 mol % FeO were considered and reaction between iron nitrate and fuel (glycine, urea, and citric acid) was balanced without considering the presence of ambient oxygen in the reactions. Experiments were carried out and obtained powders were characterized by XRD, FTIR, VSM, and SEM analysis. FTIR and XRD results demonstrated that all synthesized powders were multi-phase including Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 phases which indicated the oxidation of product due to the interference of atmospheric oxygen. Based on the quantitative analysis applied to XRD patterns, the amount of ambient oxygen interfered in the synthesis process was calculated. Obtained results demonstrated that the amount of the interference of ambient oxygen is highly influenced by the fuel type. For synthesizing 1 mol product using glycine, urea, and citric acid, the amount of interfered ambient oxygen was 0.25 mol, 0.17 mol, and 0.1 mol, respectively.					khaki, Jalil/AAD-1570-2020; Mollazadeh, S/AAA-5872-2020	Mollazadeh, S/0000-0002-8216-5866													0272-8842	1873-3956				OCT 1	2019	45	14					17775	17783		10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.348													WOS:000482244200130

The study of STXs toxicity has been carried out but little is known about the response of antioxidant enzymes activities to STXs in mice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate biochemical responses and oxidative stress induced by STXs extracted from Acanthocardia tuberculatum. To this end, daily, mice were treated orally for 7 days with sublethal concentrations (10 & mu;g/100 g mouse). The animal's liver was assessed using biomarkers such as activities of catalase (CAT), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). In the blood, plasmatic markers were analysed as glutamic oxalic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea and creatinine. Globally, test toxicity test showed a significant decrease in the weight at 10 & mu;g /100 g mouse, and the results showed an increase of GPT, GOT, CPK, LDH, CAT and TBARS activities and the inhibitory effect of GAPDH activities but creatinine, urea and SDH activities showed no significative difference from the control. We concluded that STXs induce oxidative stress breaking in mice the balance of the defence system and causing oxidations reactions. Moreover, STXs affect energy metabolism in mice, however, renal function in mice is not affected by exposure to STXs.

European farmers and consumers spend an estimated Euro15.5 billion per year on inorganic fertilizers and the production of N-fertilizers results in a high carbon footprint. We investigated if fertilizer type and medium constituents determine microbial nitrogen conversions in organic growing media and can be used as a next step towards a more sustainable horticulture. We demonstrated that growing media constituents showed differences in urea hydrolysis, ammonia and nitrite oxidation and in carbon dioxide respiration rate. Interestingly, mixing of the growing media constituents resulted in a stimulation of the function of the microorganisms. The use of organic fertilizer resulted in an increase in amoA gene copy number by factor 100 compared to inorganic fertilizers. Our results support our hypothesis that the activity of the functional microbial community with respect to nitrogen turnover in an organic growing medium can be improved by selecting and mixing the appropriate growing media components with each other. These findings contribute to the understanding of the functional microbial community in growing media and its potential role towards a more responsible horticulture.

A better understanding of structural changes of lignin is necessary to optimize pretreatment conditions and efficient utilization of the resultant lignin. The current study reported the structural features of lignin recovered from alkaline ChCl/imidazole and ChCl/urea DES pretreatment, and the mechanism of lignin modification was revealed. The profiling demonstrated that lignin samples possessed a high purity (>94.4%), low molecular weight ranging from 1544 to 2562 g/mol and an excellent uniformity (PDI < 1.6). Noteworthy, the content of beta-O-4' linkages in lignin was over 75% (i.e. 72.2%-77.4% retention); S/G ratio was increased whereas the content of-OCH3 groups were decreased. It was revealed that slight cleavage of beta-O-4' linkages, preferential breakdown of G units, and demethylation reaction were occurred during alkaline ChClbased DES pretreatment. Specifically, cleavage of ester linkages between PB and lignin macromolecule was taking place during ChCl/imidazole pretreatment at a high temperature; whereas oxidation only appeared in ChCl/urea system. Despite the modification, well beta-O-4' preserved and less condensed lignin samples were recovered after low-temperature pretreatment. Consequently, high contents of phenol derivatives (26.3-30.6%) were achieved in lignin oil. The present study provides critical information on alkaline ChCl-based DES pretreatment, which will contribute to the valorization of lignin by-products and will be beneficial to the development of biorefineries.

Soil was sampled from a long-term agronomic experiment with conventional tilled beds and crop residue retention (CT treatment), permanent beds with crop residue burned (PBB treatment) or retained (PBC) left unfertilized or fertilized with 300 kg urea-N ha(-1) and cultivated with wheat (Triticum durum L.)/maize (Zea mays L.) rotation. Soil samples, fertilized or unfertilized, were amended or not (control) with a solution of (NH4)(2)SO4 (300 kg N ha(-1)) and were incubated aerobically at 25 +/- 2 degrees C for 56 days, while CO2 emission, mineral N and the bacterial community were monitored. Application of NH4+ significantly increased the C mineralization independent of tillage-residue management or N fertilizer. Oxidation of NH4+ and NO2- was faster in the fertilized soil than in the unfertilized soil. The relative abundance of Nitrosovibrio, the sole ammonium oxidizer detected, was higher in the fertilized than in the unfertilized soil; and similarly, that of Nitrospira, the sole nitrite oxidizer. Application of NH4+ enriched Pseudomonas, Flavisolibacter, Enterobacter and Pseudoxanthomonas in the first week and Rheinheimera, Acinetobacter and Achromobacter between day 7 and 28. The application of ammonium to a soil cultivated with wheat and maize enriched a sequence of bacterial genera characterized as rhizospheric and/or endophytic independent of the application of urea, retention or burning of the crop residue, or tillage.

J	Sirviö, JA; Åmmälä, A				Sirvio, Juho Antti; Ammala, Ari			High-yield hydrogen peroxide treatment of refined softwood in recyclable deep eutectic solvent to produce moisture-tolerant wood nanofiber films	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS												In this study, a novel hydrogen peroxide treatment of refined softwood (thermomechanical pulp) in urea-LiClbased deep eutectic solvent with negligible material loss (<2 %) was studied as a pre-treatment in the production of wood nanofibers (WNF). A short treatment time (2 min) was shown to slightly alter the structure of wood by increasing the oxygen content at the surface of the fibers and increasing the fine fiber fraction content due to the mild oxidation of surface of fibers potentially via hydrogen peroxide mediated formation of lithium hypochlorite. The mild alteration of the fiber structure resulted in the formation of a WNF film with 33 % higher tensile index compared to films obtained from WNF produced without hydrogen peroxide treatment. Furthermore, deep eutectic solvent recyclability was successfully demonstrated for five consequent treatments. In addition, hot pressing of the WNF films was investigated to improve the water tolerance (wet tensile strength) of the films. By studying various pressing conditions (time, temperature, and pressure), the wet tensile strength of films was increased from 1.0 kNm/kg to almost 20 kNm/kg with only ten minutes pressing time. The increase in wet tensile strength was effectively correlated to a decrease in the water uptake of the films during submersion in water. Simultaneously to the increased water tolerance, the dry tensile properties of the films decreased, but always remained above 40 kNm/kg.																			0926-6690	1872-633X				DEC 15	2024	222		2						119703	10.1016/j.indcrop.2024.119703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2024.119703		SEP 2024											WOS:001321920400001

The present work describes the establishment of a simple, new and sensitive sensor based on elelctropolymerized polyurea modified glassy carbon electrode (EPPU/GCE) for OTC determination, which is one of the most frequently used antibiotics to treat certain diseases. Though urea is a simple, inexpensive and nontoxic, its use in the development of modified electrodes for electrochemical determination of pharmaceuticals has not been studied. The fabricated sensor (EPPU/GCE) was characterized via cyclic voltammetry and elec-trochemical impedance spectroscopy using Fe(CN)63-/4-solution as a probe. The electrochemical activity of poly (EPPU)/GCE for oxytetracycline oxidation was examined with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) of pH 7.5. A well -resolved and more enhanced two oxidative peaks for OTC solution in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) of pH 7.5 were observed at EPPU/GCE. The SWV measurement demonstrated a good linear range (1-200 mu M) and detection limit (Ipa1 =1.01 x10-1 mu M and Ipa2 = 9.83 x10-2 mu M) for OTC. Electrochemical response of OTC at EPPU/GCE was not influenced by the presence of paracetamol, uric acid and glucose, showing good selectivity. The fabricated sensor has been effectively applied for detecting OTC in milk and four brands of veterinary in-jection samples, and the detected percentage recovery of OTC in each injection sample was above 99.25% of the labeled value and above 96% for milk sample. Thus, the developed sensor could potentially be used for elec-trochemical determination of OTC in other pharmaceuticals, biological, environmental and food samples.

CNFs with different carboxyl contents were prepared by a TEMPO (2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical)-medium oxidation system. The cellulose-based macrogels were prepared by dissolving CFs and CNFs in a NaOH/urea aqueous solution and a followed extrusion process. The carboxyl groups within the macrogels were then activated by an N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC center dot HCl)/Nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) system, which provides these macrogels with efficient binding sites for enzyme immobilization. The three-dimensional network structures of the macrogels facilitate the enzymes to infiltrate into the core of the macrogels and be fixed on the abundant pore walls. The immobilized enzymes maintain activity at a higher pH than free enzymes. Moreover, the immobilized enzymes have higher temperature tolerance, and their optimal reaction temperature is about 10 degrees C higher than that of free enzymes. The immobilized enzymes retain 24% of the initial activity after repeated use for 7 times. The microporous regenerated cellulose-based macrogels show potential in the fields of enzyme immobilization and biocatalysis.

Preparation and Evaluation of Nickel Oxide-Carbon Nanotube Supported Palladium as Anode Electrocatalyst for Formic Acid Fuel Cells	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE												In this study, promotional effects of NiO on Pd/NiO-CNT catalysts (CNT: carbon nanotubes) for formic acid oxidation is investigated. Firstly, NiO is loaded on CNT in various amounts by precipitation-deposition method using urea as precipitating agent, and then palladium is deposited on the NiO-CNT support material by the borohydride reduction method. The synthesized catalysts are characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, TEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption and XPS for their morphology, composition and electronic structure. Cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and carbon monoxide stripping voltammetry reveal that the addition of NiO enhances the electrocatalytic activity and stability of Pd/NiO-CNT catalysts remarkably. Highest current density (80.83 mA/cm(2)) is achieved for the catalyst with 15 wt. % NiO content which is three times higher than the current density shown by Pd/CNT (23.23 mA/cm(2)). The maximum power density in passive direct formic acid fuel cell is found to be 13.6 and 6.2 mW/cm(2) for Pd/15% NiO-CNT and Pd/CNT, respectively, which clearly demonstrate the beneficial effect of addition of NiO on Pd/NiO-CNT. The improvement in the electrocatalytic activity and stability is ascribed to the formation of small and highly dispersed Pd particles and the modification of electronic structure of Pd in presence of NiO.

Meanwhile, cogeneration of H2 and O2 may result in the formation of an explosive H2/O2 gas mixture due to gas crossover. Considering these factors, a favorable anodic oxidation reaction is employed to replace OER, which not only reduces the voltage for H2 production at the cathode and avoids H2/O2 gas mixture but also generates value-added products at the anode. In recent years, this innovative strategy that combines anodic oxidation for H2 production has received intensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis. In this review, the latest research progress of a coupled hydrogen production system with pollutant degradation/upgrading is systematically introduced. Firstly, wastewater purification via anodic reaction, which produces free radicals instead of OER for pollutant degradation, is systematically presented. Then, the coupled system that allows for pollutant refining into high-value-added products combined with hydrogen production is displayed. Thirdly, the photoelectrical system for pollutant degradation and upgrade are briefly introduced. Finally, this review also discusses the challenges and future perspectives of this coupled system.

J	Yepsen, DV; Levipan, HA; Molina, V				Yepsen, Daniela, V; Levipan, Hector A.; Molina, Veronica			Nitrospina bacteria in a rocky intertidal habitat (Quintay Bay, central Chile)	MICROBIOLOGYOPEN												Nitrospina bacteria are among the most important nitrite oxidizers in coastal and open-ocean environments, but the relevance of the genus contrasts with the scarceness of information on their ecophysiology and habitat range. Thus far, Nitrospina bacteria have been the only nitrite oxidizers detected at high abundance in Chilean coastal waters. These levels are often higher than at other latitudes. In this study, the abundance of 16S-rRNA gene transcripts of Nitrospina (hereafter just transcripts) was measured by reverse transcription quantitative PCR in a rocky intertidal gradient and compared with the nearshore counterpart off central Chile (similar to 33 degrees S). Rocky pond transcripts were also compared with the taxonomic composition of the macrobiota and bacterioplankton (by 16S-rRNA gene-based T-RFLP) in the intertidal gradient. Transcripts increased from warmer, saltier, and low-nitrite ponds in the upper intertidal zone (19.5 +/- 1.6 degrees C, 39.0 +/- 1.0 psu, 0.98 +/- 0.17 mu mol/L) toward cooler, less salty, and high-nitrite ponds (17.8 +/- 2.6 degrees C, 37.7 +/- 0.82 psu, 1,23 +/- 0.21 mu mol/L) from middle and low zones. These varied from -1,000 up to 62,800 transcripts. This increasing trend in the number of transcripts toward the lower zone was positively associated with the Shannon's diversity index for the macrobiota (r = .81, p < .01). Moreover, an important increase in the average number of transcripts was observed in ponds with a greater number of fish in the upper (7,846 transcripts during 2013) and lower zones (62,800 transcripts during 2015). Altogether, intertidal and nearshore transcripts were significantly correlated with nitrite concentrations (r = .804, p < .01); rocky pond transcripts outnumbered nearshore ones by almost two orders of magnitude. In summary, rocky ponds favored both the presence and activity of Nitrospina bacteria that are tolerant to environmental stress. This in turn was positively influenced by the presence of ammonia- or urea-producing macrobiota.

Thirty-two Songliao black fattening pigs with an initial body weight of 85.48 +/- 2.31 kg were completely randomized into eight treatment groups, with four replicates in each treatment group and one pig in each replicate. The pigs were placed in a respiratory metabolic chamber for a 6-day trial. There was one pig per respiratory metabolic chamber in a single cage. The results showed that the average daily weight gain in the normal-temperature, high-energy, and high-fat groups was higher than that of the low-temperature, normal-energy, and low-fat groups (p < 0.05). The fat deposition rate, protein oxidation, and fat oxidation of the high-fat group were higher than those of the low-fat group (p < 0.05). The energy digestibility, protein digestibility, and fat digestibility in the high-fat group were higher than those in the normal-energy group (p < 0.05). The fat digestibility and energy deposition rate in the high-fat group were higher than those in the low-fat group (p < 0.05). The respiratory quotient in the high-energy group was lower than that in the normal-energy group (p < 0.05), and the respiratory quotient in the high-fat group was lower than that in the low-fat group (p < 0.05). There was an interaction between temperature and energy sources in terms of the respiratory quotient, fat oxidation, blood urea nitrogen content, and glucose content (p < 0.05). Appropriately increasing the energy level of the diet and improving the energy structure of the feed (increasing the level of fats and oils) will benefit Songliao black fattening pigs by increasing their energy use efficiency and at the same time reducing greenhouse gas CO2 emissions, and these changes are more pronounced in cold environments.

Serum Branched-Chain Amino Acid Metabolites Increase in Males When Aerobic Exercise Is Initiated with Low Muscle Glycogen	METABOLITES												This study used global metabolomics to identify metabolic factors that might contribute to muscle anabolic resistance, which develops when aerobic exercise is initiated with low muscle glycogen using global metabolomics. Eleven men completed this randomized, crossover study, completing two cycle ergometry glycogen depletion trials, followed by 24 h of isocaloric refeeding to elicit low (LOW; 1.5 g/kg carbohydrate, 3.0 g/kg fat) or adequate (AD; 6.0 g/kg carbohydrate 1.0 g/kg fat) glycogen. Participants then performed 80 min of cycling (64 +/- 3% VO2 peak) while ingesting 146 g carbohydrate. Serum was collected before glycogen depletion under resting and fasted conditions (BASELINE), and before (PRE) and after (POST) exercise. Changes in metabolite profiles were calculated by subtracting BASELINE from PRE and POST within LOW and AD. There were greater increases (p < 0.05, Q < 0.10) in 64% of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) metabolites and 69% of acyl-carnitine metabolites in LOW compared to AD. Urea and 3-methylhistidine had greater increases (p < 0.05, Q < 0.10) in LOW compared to AD. Changes in metabolomics profiles indicate a greater reliance on BCAA catabolism for substrate oxidation when exercise is initiated with low glycogen stores. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for anabolic resistance associated with low muscle glycogen, and suggest that exogenous BCAA requirements to optimize muscle recovery are likely greater than current recommendations.

In this work, we report the preparation of porous Fe-doped g-C3N4 catalysts by one-step thermal polymerization using urea and transition metal salts as precursors and investigate the effect of atmosphere conditions (air and nitrogen) on the catalytic performance. Systematic characterizations show that Fe-doped g-C3N4 prepared in air (FeNx-CNO) has a larger specific surface area (136.2 m(2) g(-1)) and more oxygen vacancies than that prepared in N-2 (FeNx-CNN, 74.2 m(2) g(-1)), giving it more active sites to participate in the reaction. Meanwhile, FeNx-CNO inhibits the recombination of photogenerated carriers and improves the light utilization. The redox cycling of Fe(III) and Fe(II) species in the photocatalytic system ensures the continuous generation of SO5 center dot(-) and SO4 center dot(-). Therefore, FeNx-CNO can remove CBZ up to 96% within 20 min, which is 3.4 times higher than that of CNO and 3.1 times higher than that of FeNx-CNN, and the degradation efficiency can still retain 93% after 10 cycles of reaction. This study provides an economical and efficient method for photocatalysis in the degradation of medicines in contaminated water.					小玉, 彭/AAJ-8122-2020															2073-4344				AUG	2024	14	8							520	10.3390/catal14080520	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/catal14080520													WOS:001307355200001

Various characterization analyses, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), showed that the doped composite LFCN catalysts exhibited a hemispherical network structure with a larger specific surface area than that of the pure phase LaFeO3 material. In addition, the LaFeO3 material adjusted the electronic structure of the original LaFeO3 chalcogenide material to a certain extent after in situ doping with organic C and N elements, which enhanced its lattice oxygen oxidation ability. In the study of the catalytic degradation of sodium humate solution under natural light conditions, the catalytic performance was significantly improved compared to that of the pure phase LaFeO3, and 10 mg of the catalyst degraded 30 mg/L of sodium humate solution in 50 min, with a degradation rate increasing from 40 to 98%. The degradation rate increased from 40 to 98% after 4 applications, indicating that the LFCN catalyst has good stability and significant catalytic degradation performance.

The present study was designed to explore the potential protective effect of ginsenoside Rg5, a rare ginsenoside generated during steaming ginseng, on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in a mouse experimental model. The possible mechanisms underlying this nephroprotective effect were also investigated for the first time. Rg5 was given at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg for 10 consecutive days. On Day 7, a single nephrotoxic dose of cisplatin (25 mg/kg) was injected to mice. Cisplatin administration resulted in renal dysfunction as evidenced by increase in serum creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. In addition, cisplatin increased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), the makers of lipid peroxidation, and depleted glutathione (GSH) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in renal tissues. These effects were associated with the significantly increased levels of cytochrome P450 E1 (CYP2E1), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-1, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) p65, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in renal tissues. However, pretreatment with ginsenoside Rg5 significantly attenuated the renal dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation response induced by cisplatin. Furthermore, ginsenoside Rg5 supplementation inhibited activation of apoptotic pathways through increasing Bcl-2 and decreasing Bax expression levels. Histopathological examination further confirmed the nephroprotective effect of Rg5. Collectively, these results clearly suggest that Rg5-mediated alleviation of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity may be related to its anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects.

J	Nishimura, A; Otsuka, S				Nishimura, Ayato; Otsuka, Sonoka			Sulfated cellulose pulp with high water retention and a swollen fiber structure for the preparation of completely dispersed cellulose nanofibers	CELLULOSE												In this study, sulfated cellulose pulps (SCPs), synthesized via environmentally friendly methods by supporting sulfamic acid and urea on wood-derived cellulose pulps (CPs), were used to prepare completely dispersed cellulose nanofibers (CNs). CP is a sustainable natural polymer that is biodegradable, nontoxic, and relatively inexpensive. Additionally, cellulose nanofibers prepared from CPs have attracted attention as promising natural nanofibers with various useful properties. Therefore, sulfation of CP with sulfamic acid and urea was investigated as a method for preparing completely dispersed CNs. The SCPs were synthesized in high yields through the sulfamic acid >= urea (molar ratio) reaction system at 393 K for 30 min. The SCPs contained sulfate groups with 0.79-1.33 mmol g-1 at hydroxy groups of C6, and C2 and/or C3 positions of cellulose, maintained long fibers and exhibited a 429-880 degree of polymerization (DP), retaining 60% more DP than the original CP. Some SCPs attained a maximum water retention value of approximately 3000%, suggesting a swollen fiber structure. Completely dispersed sulfated CNs with a fiber diameter of approximately 3-4 nm could be prepared by defibrating these SCPs.

Compared to pure TiO2, the Co3O4/TiO2 nano composite with the optimum Co/Ti molar ratio of 0.30 demonstrates significantly enhanced catalytic activity as well as excellent catalytic durability for abatement of refractory poisonous benzene (a typical air pollutant) with ultraviolet-visible-infrared (UV-vis-IR) irradiation. It also exhibits effective catalytic activity for benzene abatement even with lambda > 830 nm IR irradiation. Its very high catalytic activity derives from light-driven thermocatalytic benzene oxidation on nano Co3O4 in the Co3O4/TiO2 nanocomposite. A novel synergetic effect among light-driven thermocatalysis on Co3O4 and UV photocatalysis on TiO2 in the Co3O4/TiO2 nanocomposite is discovered to remarkably promote catalytic activity and improve catalytic durability by inhibiting the formation of refractory carbonaceous intermediates on TiO2 by photocatalysis: energetic species produced by UV photocatalysis on TiO2 move from TiO2 to Co3O4 through the interface between nano Co3O4 and TiO2, thus accelerating the light-driven thermocatalytic benzene oxidation on nano Co3O4. A novel photoactivation, completely different from photocatalysis on TiO2, is discovered to further considerably accelerate light-driven thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4: Irradiation not only promotes the activity of lattice oxygen of nano Co3O4 but also accelerates the reoxidation of the reduced cobalt oxide (Co3O4-x), resulting in a considerable enhancement in the light-driven thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4. The light-driven themocatalysis together with the novel photocatalysis-thermocatalysis synergetic effect and photoactivation in the Co3O4/TiO2 nanocomposite cause a tremendous enhancement of 489 times in benzene mineralization rate (initial production rate of CO2) as compared to the photocatalytic benzene abatement under UV-vis-IR irradiation with the same light intensity at near room temperature.

Forty male Hampshire x Suffolk lambs (23.79 +/- 2.24 kg) were used in a completely randomized experimental design. Treatments consisted of dietary inclusion of a polyherbal additive based on Emblica officinalis and Ocimum sanctum at 0, 5, 10, and 15 g/kg dry matter for 60 d. There were no effects on daily gain, dry matter intake, feed conversion, back fat thickness, and Longissimus dorsi area; however, hot carcass dressing improved linearly as the level of herbal additive supplementation was increased. The antioxidants of the polyherbal additive linearly inhibited lipid oxidation of the meat (24 h; day 10) and improved its water-holding capacity (24 h). Meat lightness after 1 d was reduced linearly, but no changes were detected in other color parameters. Metabolites (glucose, urea, cholesterol) related to energy or protein metabolism were not affected by the herbal additive. Lymphocytes and basophiles were reduced linearly whereas monocytes and segmented neutrophils increased linearly for polyherbal additive. The inclusion of the polyherbal additive does not improve daily gain or feed efficiency in finishing lambs but improves the carcass dressing and antioxidant capacity of the meat.

A combined experimental and density functional theory study of metformin oxy-cracking for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment	RSC ADVANCES												Pharmaceutical compounds are emerging contaminants that have been detected in surface water across the world. Because conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to treat such pollutants, new technologies are needed to degrade and oxidize such contaminants. The newly developed oxy-cracking process was utilized to treat the antidiabetic drug, metformin. The process, which involved partial oxidation of metformin in alkaline aqueous medium, proved to decompose the drug into small organic molecules, with minimum emission of CO2, therefore, increasing its biodegradability and removal from industrial treatment plants. The reaction gaseous products were probed by online gas chromatography. The liquid phase before and after oxy-cracking was analyzed for total carbon content by TOC and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The products formed from the nitrogen-rich drug included ammonia, amines, amidines, and urea derivatives. A reaction mechanism for the oxy-cracking process is proposed. Because the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) is believed to play a central role in the oxy-cracking process, the mechanism is initiated by (OH)-O-center dot attacks on metformin, followed by single decomposition or isomerization steps into stable products. The reactions were investigated using density functional theory calculations and validated using high quality 2nd order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory energy calculations.

To date, In promotion has been limited to noble metals because of its tendency to "bury" other metals thus compromising the catalytic activity. Here, we prepared a silica-supported Cu-In catalyst via a urea-assisted co-precipitation method that showed a higher H-2 productivity compared to the monometallic catalyst and a remarkable H-2/CO2 molar ratio of almost 3 at 220 degrees C. Through XPS, XRPD and HRTEM-EDX along with H-2 - and CO-TPR, H2O-TPD, and N2O titrations, supported by computational modeling, we attributed such superior performances to an easier H2O activation due to improved electronic properties of the Cu phase, that is, its lower oxidation state via electron density transfer from the InOx buffer phase as a 1D "necklace" structures crucially mediating the interaction of small Cu nanoparticles (2.6 nm) and silica.

However, the adsorbed contaminants should be treated further. This study is intended to degrade or mineralize adsorbed contaminants using biochar. Among biowaste, nitrogen rich materials can produce graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with photocatalytic activity through pyrolysis. In this study, urea, glycine, L(+)-arginine, and puree were used to prepare photocatalytic biochars. XRD analysis and screening tests were performed to evaluate the production of g-C3N4. As model compounds, Orange G (OG) and Cr(VI) were oxidized and simultaneously reduced in a reactor by biochar. Additionally, biochar effectively activated persulfate to sulfate radicals. The oxidation rate of OG was enhanced by the addition of persulfate, where synergistic effects were observed. Therefore, photocatalytic biochar could be an alternative for treating environmental pollutants. (C) 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A study of chemical composition and physical-mechanical properties of rigid polyurethane-polyisocyanurate foams changes under conditions of extreme heating	CELLULAR POLYMERS												Polyurethane-polyisocyanurate rigid (PIR) foams are used as thermal insulation materials in a wide range of applications such as construction and pipe insulation. Some of the utilizations require the maximum operating temperature of these materials to reach extremely high temperatures. This work is devoted to the study of changes in the chemical composition and the main physical-mechanical and thermophysical characteristics of PIR foams subjected to prolonged extreme heating in the presence of the material direct contact with air and in its absence. Based on the results obtained, prolonged extreme heating of such materials leads to a significant change in their chemical composition, mainly due to the thermal decomposition of allophanate, urethane and urea linkages, as well as the gradual formation of uretidione, linear carbodiimide polymer and the oxidation of ethers to esters. The relative compressive strength of these materials changes only to a small extent, while the thermal conductivity of these materials increases significantly during heating.

Herein, a novel hypervalent iodine-induced twofold oxidative coupling of amines with amides and thioamides has been established. The protocol accomplishes divergent C(O)-N and C(S)-N disconnection by the previously unknown Ar-O and Ar-S oxidative coupling and highly chemoselectively assembles the versatile yet synthetically challenging oxazoles and thiazoles. Employing amides instead of thioamides affords an alternative bond cleavage pattern, which is a result of the higher n(N)-pi*(C=S) conjugation in thioamides. Mechanistic investigations indicate ureas and thioureas generated in the first oxidation as pivotal intermediates to realize the oxidative coupling. These findings open up new avenues for exploring oxidative amide and thioamide bond chemistry in various synthetic contexts.					ma, yang/KXR-3046-2024	Szostak, Michal/0000-0002-9650-9690													2041-6520	2041-6539				MAR 22	2023	14	12					3338	3345		10.1039/d3sc00301a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d3sc00301a		FEB 2023						36970078					WOS:000944115800001

The solid-phase synthetic route began on a solid supported N'-cyano-N-substituted carbamimidothioate, which was prepared from cyanamide, isothiocyanate, and Merrifield resin. After N-alkylation of carbamimidothioate resin with ethyl 2-bromoacetate, an imidazole ring is introduced by Thorpe-Ziegler-type cyclization. The resulting imidazole resin is converted to 1,3,7-trisubstituted xanthine resin using sequential reactions, such as Lewis acid-catalyzed urea formation, pyrimidine ring cyclization, and N-alkylation. After oxidation of sulfides to sulfones, traceless cleavage with amine or thiol nucleophiles afforded the desired 1,3,7,8-tetrasubstituted xanthines in good purities and overall yields (eight-steps; 36 examples). This efficient solid-phase synthesis enables the incorporation of four diversity points into the preparation of the 1,3,7,8-tetrasubstituted xanthines.

However, the exact interaction between various doped nitrogen species and palladium (Pd) have rarely been reported for formic acid electrooxidation (FAO). In this study, the effect of the doped pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N on the electronic structure and the electrochemical activity of Pd toward FAO are investigated. The oxidation state of Pd is reduced and more metallic Pd is formed when Pd nanoparticles supported on pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N doped carbon materials. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations simulate that the adsorption energy of HCOO* and *COOH on Pd/pyrrolic-N are lower than those on Pd/pyridinic-N. Both DFT and electrochemical measurements suggest that the FAO activity of Pd is more correlated with the pyrrolic-N than pyridinic-N. The catalyst contains more pyrrolic-N species exhibits higher electrochemical activity and faster kinetics for FAO reaction. Moreover, Pd2+-N complexes are formed in all the nitrogen doped catalysts and display good activity for FAO. In this study, Pd supported on urea treated carbon (Pd/UR) owns the highest content of pyrrolic-N and exhibits the best activity for FAO. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The two-dimensional nanocomposite was used to modify a carbon paste electrode and its electrochemical performance of electrode was carefully evaluated. The electrochemical oxidation of glucose at modified electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.2 M KOH. It revealed a remarkable electrocatalytic behavior and noticeably synergistic effect as a result of decent exfoliation of graphitic carbon nitride in the presence of Co(OH)(2). The amperometric response achieved by the modified electrode showed two calibration ranges with an excellent selectivity. A single-frequency impedance method was applied for glucose determination as an alternative to conventional EIS methods. The developed sensor represents a high sensitivity, wide concentration range (25 mu M - 420.0 mM by impedimetry and 6.6-9800 mu M by amperometry), and high reproducibility. The modified electrode showed a good selectivity for glucose over potentially interfering materials such as dopamine, ascorbic acid, urea, and uric acid.

Herein, we have created a computational approach, based on the density functional theory (DFT) and electrical double-layer interface models with explicit hydrogen bonding, to accurately predict potential-dependent reaction pathways, catalytic activity, and product selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction. The onset potentials and the potential to achieve maximum faradaic efficiency of CO2 reduction were calculated, which agree well with the experimental results for single-atom catalysts.

This work gives a deeper understanding of the different properties of PCN and the observed intermediates when melamine or urea are chosen as precursors and heated to temperatures in the range of 350-575 degrees C. Melem or a melem-tetramer are the main intermediates when melamine is used as starting material, while urea-based PCN is formed via a supramolecular assembly of melamine and cyanuric acid. This leads to crucial differences in properties such as surface area, amount of NH2-groups and photocatalytic activity. PCN from urea, loaded with Pt nanoparticles, shows higher activities for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to more NH2-groups. The melem-tetramer shows nanosheetlike structure combined with a high amount of NH2-groups and has the highest activity of all prepared catalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). Thus, this research demonstrates the formation mechanism and the design of PCN based catalysts with a large amount of NH2-groups and a high photocatalytic reduction ability.					von Seggern, Aaron/KYQ-2175-2024; Taffa, Dereje/E-4855-2017	von Seggern, Aaron R./0009-0003-0767-151X; Taffa, Dereje H/0000-0002-1778-8223														2574-0970				DEC 27	2023	7	1					1402	1415		10.1021/acsanm.3c05516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.3c05516													WOS:001143441200001

In this study, we investigated the nitrifying population and community dynamics in response to fertilization in paddy soil under long-term treatment with different urea concentrations (0, 100, 200, and 300 kg N ha(-1); designated N0, N100, N200, and N300, respectively). The community structure of nitrifiers, including comammox, was changed by long-term N fertilizers input, which also enhanced AOB abundance and comammox clade A/B abundance ratio, whereas it did not affect AOA abundance. Nevertheless, the microbial population sizes and community compositions remained largely similar following short-term fertilization throughout one rice-growing season. Furthermore, by employing a (NO3)-N-15 pool dilution technique in combination with chlorate and 1-octyne inhibition, we conducted a soil microcosm incubation without substrate supplementation to distinguish the relative contribution of comammox to gross ammonia oxidation from those of AOA and AOB. Comammox exhibited higher nitrification activity in soils treated with more N fertilizers, with the contribution increasing from 34 % (N0) to 75 % (N300), although its abundance was not dominant. This could be attributed to the repeated N-based fertilization, which reduced the soil pH, thereby decreasing the soil-free ammonia concentration. In contrast, the contribution of AOA declined from 57 % (N0) to 19 % (N300), while that of AOB only accounted for a minor fraction (<25 %) despite being in high abundance.

The main contributors to these metabolic adaptations are inflammation, malnutrition and immobilisation. Controlled experimental models incorporating these central elements of hospitalisation are lacking. The aim of this study was to validate such a human experimental model. Methods In a randomized crossover design, six healthy young men underwent; (i) overnight fast (CTR), or (ii) exposure to systemic lipopolysaccharide (1 ng/kg) combined with 36-hour fast and bed rest (CAT). The difference in insulin sensitivity between CAT and CTR was the main outcome, determined by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp. Palmitate, glucose, urea, phenylalanine and tyrosine tracers were infused to estimate metabolic shifts during interventions. Indirect calorimetry was used to estimate energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Results Insulin sensitivity was 41% lower in CAT than in CTR (M-value, mg/kg/min): 4.3 +/- 0.2 vs 7.3 +/- 1.3, p<0.05. The median (min max) palmitate flux (mu mol/min) was higher during CAT than in CTR (257.0 (161.7 365.4) vs 131.6 (92.3 189.4), p = 0.004), and protein kinetics did not differ between interventions. C-reactive peptide (mg/L) was elevated in CAT compared with CTR (30.57 +/- 4.08 vs 1.03 +/- 0.19, p<0.001). Energy expenditure increased by 6% during CAT compared with CTR (1869 +/- 94 vs 1756 +/- 58, p = 0.04), CAT having higher lipid oxidation rates (p = 0.01) and lower glucose oxidation rates (p = 0.03). Lipopolysaccharide caused varying abdominal discomfort 2 hours post-injection, which had disappeared the following day. Conclusion We found that combined systemic inflammation, fasting and bed rest induced marked insulin resistance and increased energy expenditure and lipolysis, rendering this controlled experimental model suitable for anti-catabolic intervention studies, mimicking clinical conditions.

In the synthesis of the preceramic precursors, the addition of urea facilitates the deposition of Cerium atoms on the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles since it prevents the SiO2 from agglomeration. Both Ce and urea affects the structural and textural parameters of the obtained ceramics. Less crosslinked structures are formed when the urea concentration increases and it also provokes a reduction of the carbon crystallite size. Cerium, on the other hand, induces an increase of the carbon size as well as the number of SiOC units. Pore anisotropy and smoothness of the surface are also dependent on the composition of the material. As expected, the better thermocatalytic behavior against CO2 decomposition is found at the largest Ce amounts but also, smooth surfaces and low pore anisotropies favor the accessibility of the gases to the thermocatalytic centers.

Iodine speciation in deep eutectic solvents	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Iodine has been shown to act as a good electrocatalyst for metal digestion in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) but little is known about its speciation or reactivity in these high chloride containing media. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy measurements were made at the iodine K-edge in a range of DESs with different glycolic or acidic hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), along with examining the effect of iodine concentration between 0.01 and 0.5 mol dm(-3). Three groups of speciation were detected: mixed I2Cl-/I-3(-) (glycol and lactic acid systems), mixed I-3(-)/I-2 (oxalic acid and urea systems), and singular I-3(-) (levulinic acid system). UV-vis spectroscopy was used to confirm the speciation. Electrochemistry showed that iodine redox behaviour was unaffected by the changing speciation. Leaching data showed that metal oxidation was related not only to changing iodine speciation, but also the reactivity and coordination ability of the HBD.

Here we report a novel concept that layered double hydroxides (LDHs) can be used as a precursor to form bimetals and their oxides simultaneously. Co3O4-doped Co/CoFe nanoparticles integrated with graphitic shells are derived from the thermal decomposition of a CoFe LDH bonded with urea as the carbon precursor. The composite material shows a surprisingly high bifunctional (ORR/OER) catalytic activity. The realized core-shell structure synergistically promotes the ORR performance while cobalt oxide doped on the metal surface boosts the OER performance. In addition, the carbon shell ensures high electrical conductivity and effectively impedes the aggregation and the further oxidation of Co/CoFe nanoparticles. When integrating the catalyst into a rechargeable Zn-air battery, the battery performance shows a higher discharge potential and cycling stability (over 65 h of cycling) and a lower charge plateau compared with a Zn-air battery based on a Pt/C and RuO2 catalyst mixture. This work demonstrates a new efficient air cathode material which could be practically applied to rechargeable metal-air batteries or other fuel cells.

EPDOs with anti-fatigue activity were screened out by forced swimming test, and blood lactic acid (BLA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), superoxide dismutase (SOD), liver glycogen, muscle glycogen, and intestinal microflora were investigated. Results showed that purified EPDO-60, 277.3 kDa, with a backbone consisted of 4-Manp and 4-Glcp. EPDO-60 had the best anti-fatigue activity, because it could significantly prolong the forced swimming time, as well as down-regulating the levels of BLA and BUN, increasing SOD. Proportions of Bacter-oidetes and Firmicutes and abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in gut microflora increased after treated with EPDO-60. Accordingly, EPDO-60 could affect the community structure of gut microflora, leading to promote the balance of oxidation and antioxidation, and accelerated the fatigue metabolism in vivo.					cai, ming/HPF-1404-2023; Wu, JY/F-4406-2014; WANG, Jian/HII-3697-2022; Sun, Peilong/G-3151-2011	WANG, Jian/0000-0001-6413-4209													0141-8130	1879-0003				APR 15	2023	234								123572	10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.123572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.123572		FEB 2023						36754265					WOS:000939573100001

This crosslinking reaction involved the Schiff base formation between the aldehyde groups of DAC and the amino groups of chitosan and subsequent reduction. DAC was prepared through periodate oxidation of cellulose and solubilization in hot water at 100 A degrees C for 1 h. Four grades of DAC-crosslinked cellulose-chitosan were prepared by controlling the amount of cellulose and chitosan. The DAC-crosslinked cellulose-chitosan showed higher stability in the pH range of 2-9 over a long-term 21-day test. Additionally, the DAC-crosslinked chitosan showed a higher bovine serum albumin adsorption capacity as a result of the increased amino group content due to the crosslinking between DAC and chitosan, which occurred at multiple points in spite of a lower degree in crosslinking.					kim, seonwoo/IWE-3812-2023														0969-0239	1572-882X				DEC	2017	24	12					5517	5528		10.1007/s10570-017-1528-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-017-1528-y													WOS:000415283400021

Herein, novel iron tungsten sulfideheterojunction nanosheets (FexSy/WS2Ns) with a petal-like structure wereprepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The prepared petal-like FexSy/WS2Nsowned a large diameter size of similar to 1 mu m and a thickness of 8 nm for eachflake.

This advanced HER activity is owed to the unique thin structure and moreexposed active sites provided by defects between the crystal interface of FexSyandWS2.

The GLU sensor was produced by the drop-casting of Fe(III)-cluster ethanolic mixture on the surface of a 3D printed electrode fabricated by a carbon black loaded polylactic acid filament. The oxidation of GLU was electrocatalyzed by Fe(III), which was electrochemically generated in-situ by the Fe(III)-cluster precursor. The GLU determination was carried out by differential pulse voltammetry without the interference from common electroactive metabolites presented in sweat (such as urea, uric acid, and lactic acid), offering a limit of detection of 4.3 mu mol L-1. The exceptional electrochemical performance of [Fe3O(PhCO2)(6)(H2O)(3)]center dot PhCO2 combined with 3D printing technology forms an innovative and low-cost enzyme-free sensor suitable for noninvasive applications, opening the way for integrated 3D printed wearable biodevices.

In addition, the results indicated that the Cd treatment caused a significant decrease in HEK293 cells viability which wasattenuated by PAPS pre-treatment. Furthermore, our findings revealed that Cd injection increased the levels of urea and creatinine in the serum. The increased levels of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation along with decreased activities of SOD, CAT and GPx were significantly (p < 0.01) ameliorated by PAPS pre-treatment. Finally, histopathological studies also supported the prevention action of PAPS.

There are known different biochemical types of these biotechnologies. The most popular construction biotechnology is based on precipitation of calcium carbonate initiated by enzymatic hydrolysis of urea which follows with release of ammonia and ammonium to environment. This review focuses on the hazards and remedies for construction biotechnologies and on the novel environmentally friendly biotechnologies based on precipitation of hydroxyapatite, decay of calcium bicarbonate, and aerobic oxidation of calcium salts of organic acids. The use of enzymes or not living bacteria are the best options to ensure biosafety of construction biotechnologies. Only environmentally safe construction biotechnologies should be used for such environmental and geotechnical engineering works as control of the seepage in dams, channels, landfills or tunnels, sealing of the channels and the ponds, prevention of soil erosion and soil dust emission, mitigation of soil liquefaction, and immobilization of soil pollutants.

NMR-based serum and urine metabolomic profile reveals suppression of mitochondrial pathways in experimental sepsis-associated acute kidney injury	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-RENAL PHYSIOLOGY												Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a significant problem in the critically ill that causes increased death. Emerging understanding of this disease implicates metabolic dysfunction in its pathophysiology. This study sought to identify specific metabolic pathways amenable to potential therapeutic intervention. Using a murine model of sepsis, blood and tissue samples were collected for assessment of systemic inflammation, kidney function, and renal injury. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics quantified dozens of metabolites in serum and urine that were subsequently submitted to pathway analysis. Kidney tissue gene expression analysis confirmed the implicated pathways. Septic mice had elevated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines and increased levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, indicating both systemic inflammation and poor kidney function. Renal tissue showed only mild histological evidence of injury in sepsis. NMR metabolomic analysis identified the involvement of mitochondria! pathways associated with branched-chain amino acid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and de novo NAD(+) biosynthesis in SA-AKI. Renal cortical gene expression of enzymes associated with those pathways was predominantly suppressed. Renal cortical fatty acid oxidation rates were lower in septic mice with high inflammation, and this correlated with higher serum creatinine levels. Similar to humans, septic mice demonstrated renal dysfunction without significant tissue disruption, pointing to metabolic derangement as an important contributor to SA-AKI pathophysiology. Metabolism of branchedchain amino acid and fatty acids and NAD(+) synthesis, which all center on mitochondrial function, appeared to be suppressed. Developing interventions to activate these pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities for SA-AKI. NEW & NOTEWORTHY NMR-based metabolomics revealed disruptions in branched-chain amino acid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and NAD(+) synthesis in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. These pathways represent essential processes for energy provision in renal tubular epithelial cells and may represent targetable mechanisms for therapeutic intervention.

Renal local oxidative stress and inflammation are import contributors for progression of lupus nephritis (LN). Aim of the study: In the present study, the renal protective effect of esculetin against LN was evaluated using MRL/lpr mice. Materials and methods: MRL/lpr mice were orally administrated with esculetin (20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg) from 10 to 20 weeks and then renal function and kidney pathology were analyzed. Results: Esculetin significantly attenuated renal impairment in MRL/lpr mice by reducing blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr) and albuminuria, and ameliorated the glomerular hypertrophy, tubular interstitial fibrosis and mononuclear cell infiltration into interstitium. mRNA microarray suggested that esculetin could significantly down-regulate complement cascade, inflammation and fibrosis pathway, and up-regulate Nrf2-related anti-oxidation genes. Most surprising finding in the current study was that esculetin could inhibit the complement activation both in classical and alternative pathway using in vitro hemolysis assay, further enzyme assay suggested that esculetin blocked the C3 convertase (C4b2a) to exert this inhibitory capability. Molecular docking predicted that esculetin had four conventional hydrogen bonds interacting with C4b2a, and CDOCKER energy is relatively lower. Luciferase reporter gene demonstrated that esculetin could activate Nrf2 signaling pathway, and further flow cytometry confirmed that anti-oxidation bioactivity of esculetin was dependent on Nrf2 activation. On the other hand, esculetin could inhibit NF kappa B nuclear translocation and TGF beta-smad3 pro-fibrosis pathway. Conclusion: Esculetin shows beneficial effect on LN progression, and it may be a good natural leading compound for design of chemical compounds to treat LN.					张, 森/JPM-1863-2023	Zhang, Sen/0000-0003-1409-5795													0378-8741	1872-7573				APR 24	2022	288								115004	10.1016/j.jep.2022.115004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2022.115004		JAN 2022						35051603					WOS:000789510200003

Many researchers have studied the effect of reclaimed water on soil environment, crop yield, etc. However, carbon sequestration in reclaimed water irrigated agricultural systems is less studied. This study investigates methane uptake and photosynthesis in reclaimed water irrigation systems contributing to carbon sequestration estimation and analyzes the important factors impacting them. The results show that CH4 uptake is related to soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) with a quadratic and it has the highest uptake when WFPS is between 40 and 50%. Long-term reclaimed water irrigation could significantly decrease (p < 0.05) CH4 uptake and macroaggregate stability in the topsoil. However, reclaimed water had no significant impact on photosynthesis in comparison. The type of fertilizer is an important factor which impacts CH4 emission from soil; urea had a lower CH4 uptake and a higher CO2 emission than slow-released fertilizer. Overall, reclaimed water irrigation could effectively decrease soil carbon sequestration. A soil wetted proportion level of 40-50% was recommended in this study for favorable methane oxidation. Slow-released fertilizer in reclaimed water irrigated agriculture could better control soil carbon emission and soil carbon absorption.

Nevertheless, HEOs struggle from instability during the ODS due to the existence of acidic constituents in fuel oils. Herein, a high entropy metal nitride (HEN) was designed by a soft-urea-assisted strategy, and its structure was carefully characterized. The HEN showed excellent ODS activity with O-2 as the oxidant and a deep desulfurization was achieved under mild conditions, outperforming many noble metal-based catalysts. Detailed experiments verified that high entropy structure induces variable valences of metals in HEN, benefiting the promotion of ODS performance. The ODS byproduct, sulfone, a high-value-added product, was further separated. Moreover, the HEN remained stable after 12 h immersion in concentrated hydrochloric acid. This work would provide a type of catalyst with high catalytic activity as well as excellent stability.

The growth mechanism is also complex and changing with electrodeposition conditions. In this paper, we present new insights into the growth of metal nanostructures in AAO via electrodeposition. Two different growth modes for metal electrodeposition in porous AAO, namely center growth mode and lateral growth mode, are revealed, opening a new approach to preparing metal nanotube arrays with tailored structures. This strategy is broadly applicable to varieties of metals, such as Ni, Cu, and Ag. The resultant metal nanotube arrays give rise to improved electro-catalytic activity to small molecule oxidation (such as ethanol and urea) due to the larger surface areas. These findings help to deeply understand the metal electrodeposition in AAO, extend the application of template-assisted electrodeposition and provide innovative ideas to prepare novel metal nanomaterials.

Even though monopersulfate (MPS) is increasingly used for producing SO4 center dot- and cobalt (Co) is the most useful element for activating MPS, almost no study has ever been implemented to evaluate cobaltic catalysts for activating MPS to degrade CFR. Thus, the goal of this study is to develop Co-based catalysts for activating MPS to degrade CFR. In particular, a hierarchic composite which is fabricated based on macroscale Cu foam (CF) with the decoration of nanoscale Co-based oxide is fabricated to combine the macroscale practicability, and nanoscale functionality of Co-based oxide. The modification of CF with Co would grow CuCo2O4 directly on CF, leading to the formation of CuCo2O4@CF (CCO@CF). Moreover, different cobalt salts and dosages of urea might alter the formation of CuCo2O4, leading to various morphologies and nanostructures, such as CCO@CF with filament (CCF), CCOF@CF with thorn (CCT), and CCOF@CF with sheet (CCS). Interestingly, CCS exhibited the faster interfacial reaction rate, lower charge transfer resistance, and more abundant Co2+ sites, and oxygen vacancy, enabling CCS to show the highest catalytic activity for MPS activation to degrade CFR among these three CCO@CFs. CCS also exhibits a much lower Ea of CFR degradation than CCF, CCT, and CuOF, revealing its advantage over other catalysts. Moreover, the degradation mechanism of CFR by CCO@CF-activated MPS has been also elucidated using the tests of radical probes, and electron paramagnetic resonance for identifying contributions of OH, SO4 center dot-, and O-1(2) to CFR degradation. These results validate that CCO@CFs are useful heterogeneous catalysts for MPS activation, and especially, CCS appears as the most favorable CCO@CF to eliminate the toxic CFR.

The UV254nm/O-3 and TiO2/UV methods proved to be effective from the aspects of both the transformation and the mineralization. The transformation rates changed in the order: O-3 << TiO2/UV < UV254nm < UV254nm/O-3. Comparing the electric energy per order (EcEO) values calculated for the transformation, the most efficient method was UV254nm/O-3. However, the lowest ETOCEO value calculated for the mineralization was obtained using TiO2/UV. Identification of the aromatic intermediates revealed that the first step in the decomposition involves transformation of the aliphatic chain, in parallel with dechlorination and hydroxylation of the aromatic ring. The amount and quality of the intermediates formed depends strongly on the method applied. Matrices such as natural waters (from the River Tisza and thermal water from Kistelek) and inorganic salts exert significant effect on the transformation rates only in the case of TiO2/UV. Humic acids behave as light filter and consequently decrease the rate of photoinitiated transformation using UV254nm and UV254nm/O-3 methods, whereas they slightly enhance the effect of ozonation, most likely because humic acids and/or their intermediates promote the decomposition of ozone and increase the radical concentration. Regarding this parameter, the most sensitive method was heterogeneous photocatalysis, most likely because the well adsorbed humic acid strongly inhibits the formation of hydroxyl radical.

PCs were composed of cellulose sheets of low crystallinity, as evidenced by SEM, XRD, TGA and FTIR, oriented into unidirectional structures when the cellulose concentration was low (1 %). When the cellulose concentration was high (4 %) the structure was twisted and randomly oriented. PCs had low apparent densities of 44-88 mg/cm(3) and oil adsorption capacities ranging from 9.70 to 22.40 g/g (oil/PC) due to the ultralight porous structures. Oxidation of sodium periodate introduced dialdehyde groups into the porous structure. After the same reaction time, the aldehyde content of PC was much higher than the untreated cellulose counterpart. The resultant dialdehyde modified-PC had better urea adsorption than modified-viscose fiber. The high reactivity of PCs was related to the low crystallinity and porous structure.

Unlike the conventional redox active mediators, GCE/CB@CA-Fer-Redox modified electrode has failed to show any mediated oxidation/reduction response to various electro-active biochemicals and chemicals, viz., ascorbic acid, glucose, cysteine, caffeic acid, hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide, uric acid, dopamine, creatinine, urea, nitrite, sulfide and sulfate ions, depicting a clear advantage of using it as a voltammetric pH sensor for real-time applications. The modified electrode showed a linear voltammetric potential signal against pH in a window, 3-11, with a slope value of (partial derivative Ep/partial derivative pH) = -59 +/- 3 mV pH(-1).

A series of 10 wt% Ni- Co phyllosilicate supported over SiO2 with different Ni/Co ratio is successfully prepared by hydrothermal method where urea is used to release ammonia gradually providing a basic environment. TPR results show that adding of Co enhances the metal-support interaction. After H-2 reduction at high temperature, small and uniform Ni- Co alloy particles are well supported over silica. These catalysts are tested for dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 750 degrees C. The catalytic performance is highly affected by Ni/Co ratio: 10Ni and 7Ni3Co show high and stable activity for 100 h, whereas 5Ni5Co, 3Ni7Co and 10Co exhibit severe deactivation due to oxidation of metal sites. A harsher test has shown that adding of Co with a proper amount indeed can help to suppress metal sintering and carbon formation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The currentcontrol approaches only reduce the amount of PAT in raw materialsand food, which is difficult to remove once ingested in the body.In this study, lignin-based cross-linked particles loaded with chlorogenicacid were prepared, which intervened the liver and colon damage causedby PAT in mice. In the simulated digestion process in vitro, the accumulatedadsorption capacity of the LB/CA-SH for PAT was 0.934 mg/g. LB/CA-SHintervention reversed the shortening of the colon length, alleviatedthe changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and reducedthe levels of oxidation markers protein carbonyl and malondialdehydein the colon tissue of the model group. The absorption of sorbentalleviated the decrease of organ index and the abnormality of serumbiochemical indexes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase,urea nitrogen, and uric acid) caused by PAT.

Objective: This study investigates the protective effects of pomegranate peel against barium-mediated renal damage. Materials and methods: Rats were exposed during 21 days either to barium (67 ppm), barium + pomegranate peel (5% of diet) or to only pomegranate peel (5% of diet). Results: Exposure rats to barium provoked a significant increase in kidney malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels. Creatinine, urea and uric acid levels in plasma and urine were also modified. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, non protein thiol (NPSH) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased. Metallothionein (MT) production was increased and their genes expressions were up-regulated. All these changes were improved by dietary pomegranate peel. Moreover, the distorted histoarchitecture in kidney of barium group was alleviated by pomegranate peel. Conclusion: Our data showed, for the first time, the protective effects of pomegranate peel against barium-induced renal oxidative damage.

The products with different molecular weights were obtained by changing reaction conditions. They all were completely oxidized at C-6 and N-acetylated at C-2 according to FT-IR and NMR results. 6-Carboxyl chitins could stimulate significantly the proliferation of human skin fibroblasts (HSF) and human keratinocytes (HaCaT), and the bioactivities were concentration and Mws dependent. Within the scope of the study, 10-40 kDa of Mws and 10-100 mu g/mL of concentrations were most suitable for the HSF proliferation, but the proliferation of HaCaT increased with decreasing the concentration and Mw. In addition, 6-carboxyl chitins could also induce macrophages and fibroblasts to secrete growth factors. Therefore, 6-carboxyl chitins could be expected to be an active ingredient for wound healing.

The scanning electron microscopy observations revealed that the hybrid was composed of both core/shell and flower-like nanostructure. Composites of poly(ethylenes-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) with CNTs-NiCoAl LDH were prepared by melt blending. Their flammability performance and smoke toxicity were evaluated. CNTs-NiCoAl LDH was found to be an efficient additive to improve the flame retardancy of EVA and reduce the smoke toxicity by suppressing the emission of carbon monoxide (CO). The physical properties of the char were believed to be critical in improving the flame retardancy. The remarkable reduction in smoke toxicity of EVA upon CNTs-NiCoAl LDH was probably attributed to the combined effects of adsorption and catalysis on the oxidation of CO. POLYM.

Results demonstrated that all three glucans effectively reduced blood lead levels, alleviated inflammation, and mitigated liver damage in Pb-exposed mice, with highly oxidized yeast glucan (OYG2) exhibiting the greatest efficacy. Furthermore, the glucans attenuated Pb-induced oxidative stress and pathological changes in the kidney by elevating glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels, thereby restoring renal excretory function (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine). This restoration contributed to maintaining electrolyte homeostasis (Na+, Cl-, K+) and significantly enhanced lead excretion efficiency via urine. Additionally, the glucans modulated intestinal microbiota balance, promoted short-chain fatty acid production, and repaired Pb-induced intestinal barrier damage by upregulating tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-1). In conclusion, yeast glucans, particularly OYG2, effectively inhibited Pb absorption and facilitated its excretion through feces, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic strategy for lead toxicity.

These mostly uncultured microorganisms gain energy through nitrite oxidation, fix CO2, and thus play vital roles in nitrogen and carbon cycling. Over the last decade, our understanding of their physiology has advanced through several new discoveries, such as alternative energy metabolisms and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox Nitrospira). These findings mainly resulted from studies of terrestrial species, whereas less attention has been given to marine Nitrospirales. In this study, we cultured three new marine Nitrospirales enrichments and one isolate. Three of these four NOB represent new Nitrospira species while the fourth represents a novel genus. This fourth organism, tentatively named "Ca. Nitronereus thalassa", represents the first cultured member of a Nitrospirales lineage that encompasses both free-living and sponge-associated nitrite oxidizers, is highly abundant in the environment, and shows distinct habitat distribution patterns compared to the marine Nitrospira species. Partially explaining this, "Ca. Nitronereus thalassa" harbors a unique combination of genes involved in carbon fixation and respiration, suggesting differential adaptations to fluctuating oxygen concentrations. Furthermore, "Ca. Nitronereus thalassa" appears to have a more narrow substrate range compared to many other marine nitrite oxidizers, as it lacks the genomic potential to utilize formate, cyanate, and urea. Lastly, we show that the presumed marine Nitrospirales lineages are not restricted to oceanic and saline environments, as previously assumed.

Physicochemical properties and cytochromes P-450 kinetics of 5,5-bis (4-fluorophenyl)imidazolidine-2,4-dione, the bis(para-fluorophenyl) para-fluorophenyl) derivative of phenytoin	TETRAHEDRON												Phenytoin (PHT, brand name: Dilantin) is an anticonvulsant drug that is used in the treatment of epilepsy. PHT is metabolically inactivated by cytochromes P-450 (CYP) catalyzed aromatic hydroxylation at the para position. Therefore, Nelson et al. hypothesized that this metabolic pathway would be slowed or blocked for a PHT derivative with fluorines at the para positions of the aromatic rings (pF-PHT) p F-PHT) resulting in a molecule with increased antiseizure activity and longer duration of action relative to PHT. Interestingly, p F-PHT is less active than PHT, but has a much longer duration of action. Nelson et al. hypothesized that differences in physicochemical properties must contribute to the poor activity of p F-PHT. Thus, p F-PHT was synthesized to compare its physicochemical properties with those of PHT. In addition, the kinetics of CYP catalyzed oxidation were compared using Sprague Dawley (SD) rat liver microsomes because PHT is metabolically inactivated by CYP in the liver. The previously reported synthesis of p F-PHT employs a highly toxic reagent and produces a highly poisonous gas. Therefore, a safer synthetic route forpF-PHT p F-PHT was developed. This synthetic approach utilizes three steps: 1) a thiamine catalyzed benzoin condensation of para-fluorobenzaldehyde, 2) a nitric acid oxidation of the benzoin product to the corresponding benzil derivative, and 3) a microwave-assisted phenytoin synthesis of this benzil derivative with urea. There are no significant differences in conjugation, acidity, and lipophilicity between PHT and p F-PHT. Therefore, our results do not support the hypothesis that the low activity of p F-PHT relative to PHT results from variations in physicochemical properties. While PHT and p F-PHT have the same apparent binding affinity for the CYP proteome of the SD rat liver microsome, p F-PHT undergoes CYP catalyzed oxidation at half the rate in comparison to PHT.

J	Younesi-Kordkheili, H; Pizzi, A				Younesi-Kordkheili, Hamed; Pizzi, Antonio			Oxidized polyethylene as a new alternative coupling agent for the fiberboards made from UF resin	JOURNAL OF ADHESION												The aim of this research was to improve the bonding of bagasse fiber panels with urea formaldehyde (UF) resins by incorporating oxidized polyethylene (OPE) as a new coupling agent. To reduce the panels formaldehyde emission and to improve their water resistance was an additional aim of this work. Thus, different proportions of OPE (5, 10 and 15%) were added during the UF resin preparation instead to the second urea. The resins were then used in the production of UF-bonded bagasse fiber panels. The physicochemical, structural and thermal properties of the resins as well as water absorption, flexural properties, internal bond strength (IB) and formaldehyde emission of the panels bonded with them were measured according to standard methods. According to the FTIR spectra, the absorbance related to C = C and C = O bonds increased due to the addition of OPE to the UF resin. DSC analysis indicated that in comparison to UF resin, the curing process of UF resin containing OPE occurred at a lower temperature. The gel time shortened and the viscosity increased by the addition of OPE to the UF resin. The panels containing OPE yielded higher IB, flexural modulus and strength compared to those made from pure UF resins. The panels bonded with modified UF resins also showed lower formaldehyde emission and water absorption. Based on finding of this work, the panels containing 15% OPE emitted less formaldehyde, had higher mechanical strength and better dimensional stability than other percentages OPE-modified UF adhesives.

The as-prepared oxides were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The morphology and composition of the prepared materials could be regulated by controlling the urea concentration. Interestingly, these properties influenced the nature and amount of the hydrodebromination products generated during the degradation of BDE-47. The degradation of BDE-47 over the composite oxide prepared at a urea dosage of 3 mmol generated BDE-17 as the major isomer product, followed by BDE-28/33, -30, and -32, among the tri-bromodiphenyl ethers (tri-BDEs). Regarding the dibromodiphenyl ethers (di-BDEs) produced, the amount of the isomers decreased in the order of BDE-8/11 > BDE-7 > BDE-15 > BDE-10. And the BDE-1 among monobromodiphenyl was determined. In contrast, over the composite oxides prepared at urea dosages greater than 3 mmol, BDE-28/33 gradually become the major isomer product instead of BDE-17 among tri-BDEs. The amount of the other di-BDEs isomer such as BDE-15 and -10 approach to be comparable to that BDE-8/11. However, regardless of the urea dosage, BDE-47 converted into BDE-75 via an isomerization reaction. Based on these intermediate products identification, a possible hydrodebromination mechanism of BDE-47 over Fe-Al composite oxide was comprehensively traced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Peroxidase-Like Behavior of Ni Thin Films Deposited by Glancing Angle Deposition for Enzyme-Free Uric Acid Sensing	ACS OMEGA												We present a nanozyme-based biosensor fabricated from nanostructured Ni films deposited onto a silicon wafer by glancing angle deposition (GLAD) for enzyme-free colorimetric monitoring of uric acid (UA), a biomarker for gout, high blood pressure, heart disease, and kidney disease. The helically structured Ni GLAD nanozymes exhibit excellent peroxidase-like activity to accelerate the oxidation reaction of colorless 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue product, oxidized TMB (oxTMB), mediated by H2O2. In the presence of UA, oxTMB is reduced, decreasing the optical absorbance by an amount determined by the concentration of UA in the solution. The nanozyme not only mimics peroxidase but also possesses the notable qualities of reusability, simple operation, and reliability, making it environment-friendly and suitable for on-demand analysis. We optimized essential working parameters (pH, TMB concentration, and H2O2 concentration) to maximize the initial color change of the TMB solution. The catalytic activity of this nanozyme was compared with conventional nanofilms using the Michaelis-Menten theory. Based on this, enzyme-free biosensors were developed for colorimetric detection of UA, providing a wide detection range and a limit of detection (3.3 mu M) suitable for measurements of UA concentration in sweat. Furthermore, interference from glucose and urea was studied so as to explore the potential of the biosensor for use in the clinical diagnosis of UA biomarkers.

With exogenous urea doping, FexN contained biochar (PZBC800U) was successfully derived from endogenous Fe(OH)3 contained pharmaceutical sludge. PZBC800U effectively activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to remove 80 mg center dot L-1 levofloxacin (LEV) within 90 min. The main mechanism of PMS activation by PZBC800U for LEV degradation was revealed as non-radical pathways dominated by O-1(2) generation and direct electron transfer. The formation of FexN combined with the increase of pyridinic-N in the biochar changed the electronic structure, improved the electron transfer ability, and thus achieved the excellent PMS activation ca-pacity of the biochar. The vital function of endogenous Fe(OH)(3) was verified by comparing PZBC800U to Fe leached and extra Fe added controls. A total of 18 intermediates in the degradation of LEV were identified, and degradation pathways were proposed. Combined with the average local ionization energy calculation, the pri-ority of piperazine breakage during LEV degradation was experimentally proved and mechanistically elucidated. This study provides a new insight into FexN biochar preparation from pharmaceutical sludge and the mechanisms of its excellent PMS activation performance for LEV degradation.

In this study, five treatments, namely, CK (no urea and BB), N (0.72 g<middle dot>kg(-1) urea), 5BB+N (0.72 g<middle dot>kg(-1) urea plus 5 g<middle dot>kg(-1) BB), 10BB+N (0.72 g<middle dot>kg(-1) urea plus 10 g<middle dot>kg(-1) BB), and 20BB+N (0.72 g<middle dot>kg(-1) urea plus 20 g<middle dot>kg(-1) BB) were applied to the acidic soil of a pomelo orchard. The nitrification (AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA) and denitrification (nirS, nirK, nosZ) gene copy numbers were analyzed by qPCR, and their community diversities were determined by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The results showed that N treatment significantly promoted soil N2O emissions compared with CK, while all BB+N treatments significantly inhibited soil N2O emissions compared with N treatment. BB fertilizer promoted soil nitrification, alleviated the adverse effects from N fertilizer inputs on the AOA-amoA gene copy numbers and community diversity, and restored the AOA-amoA diversity to the initial level. BB had a strong effect on Crenarchaeota (AOA-amoA) and Nitrosospira (AOB-amoA). BB significantly promoted the denitrification gene copy numbers; increased nirS and nirK community diversity; particularly affected the relative abundance of denitrifiers such as Nonomuraea (nirS), Proteobacteria (nirK), and Rhodanobacter (nosZ); and, finally, reduced N2O emissions.

J	Maier, J; Nöth, A				Maier, Jonathan; Noeth, Andreas			Wet-chemical coating of silicon carbide fibers with hexagonal boron nitride layers	JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN CERAMIC SOCIETY												Hexagonal BN fiber coatings and BN powders were prepared by pyrolysis of the raw materials boric acid and urea in an atmosphere consisting of hydrogen and nitrogen. The powders were used to determine the appropriate mixing ratio of the raw materials to produce BN with the desired composition and crystal structure. The pyrolysis of boric acid and urea in a molar mixing ratio of 1:2 resulted in a BN that was hexagonal and had a nearstoichiometric composition. To prepare a solution for the coating of fibers, boric acid and urea were dissolved in an ethanol-water mixture. The coating was then applied to SiC filaments using a continuous roll-to-roll dip-coating process. It could be shown by SEM/EDS that BN layers were applied to the fibers. No significant bridging in the fiber bundle was found. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction that the layers were crystalline.

High-efficiency electro-oxidation of benzylamine replacing the OER to promote hydrogen production is crucial but challenging. Herein, we demonstrate NiV-layered double hydroxides for the selective oxidation of benzylamine via the introduction of high valence vanadium into alpha-Ni(OH)(2) (a typical OER catalyst). Benefiting from the vanadium doping, the NiV-LDH electrode exhibits superior activity and selectivity for the benzylamine oxidation reaction (BOR). In particular, NiV-LDH requires an ultra-low potential of 1.33 V vs. RHE to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits similar to 99% selectivity for benzonitrile production over a wide potential range. Reaction mechanism studies indicate that the introduction of vanadium changes the electronic state of NiV-LDH/NF and the Lewis acidic sites on the surface, promoting the conversion of benzylamine. Furthermore, a NiV-LDH based two-electrode electrolyzer that coupled the BOR with the HER can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.55 V, which can reduce the cell voltage by 240 mV relative to that of conventional overall water splitting.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the preventive action of the extracts of A. satureioides obtained by maceration and ultrasound-assisted extraction, quercetin and N-acetylcysteine against contrast-induced nephropathy in mice. The antioxidant activity, cytotoxicity and inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production in macrophages were evaluated. Also, chemical analyses of phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, and quercetin by LC-MS/MS present in various extracts of A. satureioides were performed. Thirty six mice were divided into six groups: control group (C), Contrast-Induced Nephropathy group (ON), Group N-acetylcysteine 200 mg/kg (NAC); Group quercetin 10 mg/kg (Q), Group Macela 10 mg/kg (M10), and Group Macela 50 mg/kg (M50). The serum levels of urea and creatinine, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and renal ultrastructure were evaluated by electron microscopy scanning. Ultrasound-assisted extraction improved the quality of extract (with 100% ethanol), since did not show toxicity to fibroblasts, and showed potent antioxidant activity and a high content of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and quercetin, in addition to being able to reduce the production of NO in dose-dependent effect in macrophages. Results showed that animals treated with Macela extracts maintained normal levels of urea, creatinine, and AOPP, while preserving ultrastructure of the renal cells. The obtained results were more promising than NAC and Q-groups in protecting against renal failure caused by CIN, showing that the plant can be a promising drug for preventing this disease.

However, it remains to be established whether these beneficial myocardial effects are associated with metformin-induced alterations in whole-body insulin sensitivity and substrate metabolism. Methods Eighteen HF patients with reduced ejection fraction and without diabetes (median age, 65 (interquartile range 55-68); ejection fraction 39 +/- 6%; HbA1c 5.5 to 6.4%) were randomized to receive metformin (n = 10) or placebo (n = 8) for 3 months. We studied the effects of metformin on whole-body insulin sensitivity using a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp incorporating isotope-labeled tracers of glucose, palmitate, and urea. Substrate metabolism and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity were determined by indirect calorimetry and high-resolution respirometry, and body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis. The primary outcome measure was change in insulin sensitivity. Results Compared with placebo, metformin treatment lowered mean glycated hemoglobin levels (absolute mean difference, - 0.2%; 95% CI - 0.3 to 0.0;p = 0.03), reduced body weight (- 2.8 kg; 95% CI - 5.0 to - 0.6;p = 0.02), and increased fasting glucagon levels (3.2 pmol L-1; 95% CI 0.4 to 6.0;p = 0.03). No changes were observed in whole-body insulin sensitivity, endogenous glucose production, and peripheral glucose disposal or oxidation with metformin. Equally, resting energy expenditure, lipid and urea turnover, and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity remained unaltered. Conclusion Increased myocardial efficiency during metformin treatment is not mediated through improvements in insulin action in HF patients without diabetes.

Herein, we have successfully designed and synthesized various cobalt nitrides (Co4N) by using different weak bases (i.e. hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), urea, and ammonium hydroxide (AH)) through nitridation treatment in ammonia (NH3) atmosphere. Physical characterization results demonstrate that Co4N-NSs (nanosheets) with vast meso/macropores and large BET surface are successfully constructed once adding carbon paper and HMT into precursors. As the synergistic effect of metallic character of Co4N phase, excellent electroconductibility of pyrolytic carbon, and large surface area, Co4N-NSs surfaces can form more Co4+ active sites in electrochemical reaction processes. Meanwhile, the abundant meso/macroporous structures constructed in Co4N-NSs further promoted its mass transfer ability. Benefitting from the above mentioned advantages, Co4N-NSs therefore exhibit more excellent glucose oxidation ability than another three control samples (i.e. Co4N-HMT, Co4N-Urea and Co4N-AH). When used for glucose detection, the optimal Co4N-NSs display excellent detection parameters as well, such as: a wide linear range of 0.6-10.0 mM, a large sensitivity of 1137.2 uA cm(-2) mM(-1) glucose, a low detection limit of 0.1 mu M, a small response time of 1.7 s, good reproducibility and stability, and the excellent anti-interference to other electroactive molecules and Cl-. Upon utilized for measuring glucose concentrations in human blood serum samples, the detection results on Co4N-NSs are accurate and satisfying as well. This work opens a new possibility for boosting electrochemical catalysis abilities of Co4N samples by the structure design.					guo, lp/S-5557-2019; Liu, Tingting/C-3529-2017														0039-9140	1873-3573				MAY 1	2018	181						154	164		10.1016/j.talanta.2017.12.082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.12.082								29426495					WOS:000426410500023

D-005, a lipid extract obtained from Acrocomia crispa fruit, has previously shown antioxidant effects. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of D-005 on renal IR-induced AKI in rats. Methods: Rats were randomized into seven groups including a negative control group (vehicle) without AKI and six groups with renal IR- induced AKI as follows: a positive control (vehicle); D-005 treatment at 25, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg; and dexamethasone at 3 mg/kg. All treatments were orally administered as single doses 1 hour before AKI induction. Biomarkers (serum creatinine, urea, and uric acid concentrations), oxidative variables, and histopathological AKI changes were evaluated in blood and kidney tissues. Results: All D-005 doses protected against IR-induced AKI in rats by significantly decreasing biomarkers and histopathological AKI changes as assessed by reduced serum concentrations of creatinine, urea, and uric acid. In addition, all D-005 doses decreased tubular damage, as shown by fewer detached cells and casts in the tubular lumen. D-005 reversed oxidation disturbance markers by decreasing malondialdehyde and sulfhydryl group concentrations in plasma and in kidney homogenates and by increasing kidney catalase activity. Dexamethasone, the reference substance, protected against IR-induced AKI in rats by reducing biochemical and histological variables of renal damage in a similar manner. Conclusion: Administration of single oral doses of D-005 markedly and significantly protected against renal IRinduced AKI, possibly due to its known antioxidant effects.

We pre-fed Wistar rats with natural astaxanthin, beta-carotene, or placebo and induced acute kidney injury using gentamicin, before examining renal tissues and measuring physiological indices. Qualitative evidence from histopathological and subcellular images, along with quantitative evidence showing treatment effects on blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine (p < 0.01), indicated that esterified Haematococcus astaxanthin surpassed beta-carotene at effectively counteracting chemical damage and protecting the kidneys from injury. Proliferation of enlarged lysosomes and mediation analysis results revealing enhanced lysosomal acid phosphatase activity were consistent with the hypothesized autophagy-lysosomal pathway being up-regulated by astaxanthin intake (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the protective effect of astaxanthin against acute kidney injury exerted through the autophagy-lysosomal detoxification pathway, which totally different from the anti-oxidation and/or conventional SOD-dependent free radical scavenging system, was demonstrated with strong evidence. In light of the pandemic outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia associated with a virus preferentially targeting the renal tubular cells, dietary astaxanthin may help bring down incidence rate of coronavirus disease, cases of acute kidney injury secondary to the disease, and mortality rate from acute kidney injury, especially when a standard of care treatment for the infectious disease is pending.					李, 倩倩/HOH-0139-2023	Liu, Yang/0000-0001-7350-0434													2211-9264					MAY	2023	72								103107	10.1016/j.algal.2023.103107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2023.103107		APR 2023											WOS:000988564100001
J	Farid, NF; Abdelwahab, NS				Farid, Nehal Fayek; Abdelwahab, Nada Sayed			Development and Validation of Different Chromatographic Methods for Analysis of Cabergoline in the Presence of Its Degradation Products: Studying Degradation Profile	CHROMATOGRAPHIA												Cabergoline is widely used as a prolactin secretion inhibitor and as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. Studying the structure of cabergoline, it contains a urea moiety and an amide group which are sensitive to degradation by hydrolysis as well as an alkene bond that is susceptible to oxidation. Degradation was performed regarding ICH recommendations including hydrolysis (pH from 1.3 to 12.7 using HCl or NaOH with different molarities), oxidation, photo, and thermal degradations. The drug was highly sensitive to all studied conditions except thermal degradation with the production of three major degradation products which were isolated and identified using IR and MS analyses. Two stability indicating chromatographic methods were developed for quantification of the drug in the presence of its degradation products. The first method was HPTLC which depended on using a developing system of butanol:methanol:triethyl amine (95:5:10, by volume) and UV scanning at 280 nm. The second method was HPLC at which the drug and degradation products were separated within 5 min using acetonitrile: 0.05% aqueous triethylamine (TEA) (pH adjusted to 6.5 using 1% aqueous H3PO4) [70:30, v/v] and UV scanning was performed at 225 nm. Validation parameters were calculated according to ICH recommendations and all parameters were within the acceptable limits. Comparison was made between the developed methods and the previously published ones; the developed methods were found to be superior regarding analysis time, studying different degradation pathways, and identifying the degradation products.						abdelwahab, nada/0000-0002-0700-7542; Farid, Nehal/0000-0001-7145-565X													0009-5893	1612-1112				OCT	2019	82	10					1555	1569		10.1007/s10337-019-03763-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-019-03763-4													WOS:000485313700012

In particular, our knowledge of biological materials and their atmospheric ice nucleation properties remains scarce. Here, we present the results from systematic investigations of the ice nucleation activity of plant materials using cryo-microscopy. We examined berry juices, frozen berries, as well as extracts of leaves and dried berries of plants native to boreal regions. All of our samples possess reasonable ice nucleation activity. Their ice nucleating particle concentrations per unit of water volume vary between 9.7 x 10(5) and 9.2 x 10(9) cm(-3) when examined within temperatures of -12 to -34 degrees C. Mean freezing temperatures ranged from -18.5 to -45.6 degrees C. We show that all samples contained ice nuclei in a size range below 0.2 mu m and remain active if separated from coarse plant tissue. The results of examining ice nucleation properties of leaves and dry berry extracts suggests that their ice-nucleating components can be easily suspended in water. Sea buckthorn and black currant were analyzed using subtilisin (a protease) and urea. Results suggest proteinaceous compounds to play an important role in their ice nucleation activity. These results show that separation between ice nucleation particles stemming from microorganisms and those stemming from plants cannot be differentiated solely on proteinaceous features. Further oxidation experiments with ozone showed that black currant is highly stable towards ozone oxidation, indicating a long atmospheric life time.

In this study, 428 serum samples were collected from 107 pregnant women suffering from GDM and 107 matched healthy controls. The nontargeted metabolomics data of maternal serum samples from the first (Ti, n = 214) and second trimesters (T2, n = 214) were acquired by using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 93 differential metabolites were identified on the basis of the accurate mass and MS/MS fragmentation. After false discovery rate correction, the levels of 31 metabolites in GDM group were significantly altered in the first trimester. The differential metabolites were mainly attributed to purine metabolism, fatty acid beta-oxidation, urea cycle, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways. The fold changes across pregnancy (T2/T1) of six amino acids (serine, proline, leucine/isoleucine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, and ornithine), a lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(20:4)), and uric acid in GDM group were significantly different from those in the control groups, suggesting that these 8 metabolites might have contributed to the occurrence and progression of GDM. The findings revealed that the amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and other pathways might be disturbed prior to GDM onset and during the period from the first to the second trimester of pregnancy.

The structural features of the so obtained materials were fully characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which provided information on the oxidation state of the two metals and on the metal-metal and metalTiO(2) interactions, and by EPR analysis, which evidenced electron transfer phenomena involving copper under irradiation. The photocatalysts showed a volcano-shaped photoactivity trend in hydrogen production with increasing nominal Cu content, the maximum rate of H2 evolution (27.2 mmol h-1 gcat-1) being attained with the photocatalyst containing 0.1 wt.% of copper. In this sample CuO nanoclusters appear to be intimately coordinated with surface Ti atoms in a surface structure that partially stabilizes pre grafted copper in metallic form, possibly acting as an electron-transfer bridge at the interface between CuO nanoclusters and TiO2.

J.			Childhood severe acute malnutrition is associated with metabolic changes in adulthood	JCI INSIGHT												BACKGROUND. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a major contributor to global mortality in children under 5 years. Mortality has decreased; however, the long-term cardiometabolic consequences of SAM and its subtypes, severe wasting (SW) and edematous malnutrition (EM), are not well understood. We evaluated the metabolic profiles of adult SAM survivors using targeted metabolomic analyses. METHODS. This cohort study of 122 adult SAM survivors (SW = 69, EM = 53) and 90 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched community participants (CPs) quantified serum metabolites using direct flow injection mass spectrometry combined with reverse-phase liquid chromatography. Univariate and sparse partial least square discriminant analyses (sPLS-DAs) assessed differences in metabolic profiles and identified the most discriminative metabolites. RESULTS. Seventy-seven metabolite variables were significant in distinguishing between SAM survivors (28.4 +/- 8.8 years, 24.0 +/- 6.1 kg/m(2)) and CPs (28.4 +/- 8.9 years, 233 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2)) (mean +/- SDs) in univariate and sPLS-DA models. Compared with CPs, SAM survivors had less liver fat; higher branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), urea cycle metabolites, and kynurenine/tryptophan (KT) ratio (P < 0.001); and lower p-hydroxybutyric acid and acylcarnitine/free carnitine ratio (P < 0.001), which were both associated with hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001). SW and EM survivors had similar metabolic profiles as did stunted and nonstunted SAM survivors. CONCLUSION. Adult SAM survivors have distinct metabolic profiles that suggest reduced beta-oxidation and greater risk of type 2 diabetes (BCAAs, KT ratio, urea cycle metabolites) compared with CPs. This indicates that early childhood SAM exposure has long-term metabolic consequences that may worsen with age and require targeted clinical management.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the dissipation and degradation mechanism of IM residues in grape rhizosphere soil and to investigate its residual effect on soil enzyme activity at different IM spiking levels. The half-life of IM residue in soil was 27, 36, and 43.5 days at a spiking level of 1, 10, and 50 mg kg-1, respectively following a bi-phasic first + first-order dissipation kinetics. UHPLC-Orbitrap (TM)-MS analysis by targeted metabolomics approach revealed that IM metabolites such as IM-amine analogue, guanidine (reduction), 5-hydroxy IM (hydroxylation), IM-Urea (oxidation), reduced NO analogue of IM (oxidation), and olefin of guanidine IM (dehydrogenation) were identified and proposed the degradation mechanism in grape rhizosphere soil. Toxicity of IM residues on five extracellular enzymes, viz., dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, and urease revealed that activity of dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase remained unaffected at 60th day of sampling. The beta-glucosidase and urease were negatively affected throughout the incubation period indicating the influence of IM residues on carbon and nitrogen mineralization in soil. Thus, long-term exposure of IM to grape rhizosphere through soil drenching could affect soil enzyme activity which has a negative effect on the soil nutrient cycle and soil microbiome.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2024	31	3					3763	3774		10.1007/s11356-023-31285-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-31285-y		DEC 2023						38091217					WOS:001144264100016

Here, firstly we have synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO(2)NPs) from ammonium cerium nitrate and urea by simple refluxing, and then CDs were synthesized by using taurine (an essential amino acid) via thermal decomposition method. After that CDs/CeO2 nanocomposites have been synthesized with different wt% of CDs (0.5-5 wt%) via a facile hydrothermal method. The synthesized nano-composites exhibited higher efficiency towards the electrochemical detection of DOX as compared to bare CeO2NPs and CDs by promoting electron transfer reaction at SPCE surface with increasing amount of CDs. The 5 wt% nanocomposite (CDs-5.0/CeO2) showed the highest oxidation response towards DOX (20 mu M) at an optimized pH of 5. The cyclic voltammograms revealed that CDs-5.0/CeO2/SPCE sensing system exhibited a linear response (correlation coefficient, R-2 = 0.98) between oxidation peak current and DOX concentration in the range of 0.2-20 mu M, with a low detection limit of 0.09 mu M. Moreover, the modified CDs-5.0/CeO2/SPCE sensor exhibited superior selectivity towards DOX in the presence of common interferents. This work demonstrated that the novel CDs/CeO2/SPCE sensor can be effectively applied to detect DOX in pharmaceutical samples or in biological fluids.

The used classical biomarkers were urea and creatinine; while the new biomarkers were Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and Clusterin. Forty-five male albino rats were assigned into five groups and subjected to different treatments for nine consecutive days (vehicles; gentamicin, 100 mg/kg, subcutaneously; ascorbic acid, 200 mg/kg, orally; CPLE, 150 and 300 mg/kg b wt., orally). Three rats/group were killed on days 3, 6, and 9 for blood and tissue samples for renal and oxidation markers. Gentamicin resulted in significant increase in urea and creatinine only by the end of the experimental course; while the novel biomarkers were evident as early as 3 days upon gentamicin injection. When concurrently administered with gentamicin, CPLE significantly protected kidney tissues against gentamicin nephrotoxic effects indicated by decrement of both the novel and the classical standard biomarkers, in a dose-dependent manner. CPLE-mediated protection was attributed to its antioxidant potential indicated by significant inhibition of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in both serum and kidney homogenates. The results were further supported by histopathological examination that revealed considerable amelioration of the pathological microscopic alterations induced by repeated gentamicin injection. Phytochemical analysis of CPLE indicated presence of tannins and flavonoids. These data may suggest CPLE, based on improvement of both classical and novel renal markers, as a highly potent nephroprotective and antioxidant from natural source that could be a good remedy in conditions associated with renal disorders.

In this work, an N-TiO2 photothermal catalyst prepared by a simple sol-gel method using urea as a nitrogen and carbon source could catalyse a variety of biomass sugars to quantitatively produce lactic acid (up to 98.9% yield) in water under visible light and at a low temperature of 60 degrees C in a time as short as 30 min. N-TiO2 provides a suitable valence band position (2.51 eV) for the photo-oxidation reaction, with more active species being formed on the catalyst surface (e.g., h(+), e(-), OH and O-2) and a light-induced heating effect caused by the carbon photothermal layer, which can effectively activate carbohydrates to undergo a cascade reaction process. Theoretical calculations show that the charge of N-TiO2 is highly separated, in which the N element acts as an electron trap and is enriched with plenty of electrons, leading to effective isolation of holes and electrons. In addition, the N-TiO2 catalyst exhibits good reusability and can be recycled with little loss of activity. The developed N and C-enhanced photothermal synergistic protocol opens up an avenue for producing organic acids from renewable biomass resources under mild conditions.

Elemental analysis revealed that Field returned vanadium SCR catalysts had higher phosphorous and zinc concentrations than those from a fresh catalyst. Phosphorous concentration dropped significantly from catalyst inlet to outlet, while zinc concentration remained almost constant. Broadened infrared intensity from V5+=O and W6+=O bonds were observed from contaminated vanadium SCR samples. Anatase phases and crystallite size remained unchanged in the presence of chemical contaminants. Chemical contamination monotonically reduced NH3 storage capability but non-linearly modified acid site distribution and oxidation activity, causing differences in NOx reduction behaviors. Low chemical contamination on vanadium SCR catalyst reduced NOx conversion below 450 degrees C due to the decrease in NH3 storage capacity and oxidation activity. NOx conversion over a sample with high phosphorus concentration was lowered by the weakened NH3 storage capacity below 350 degrees C and the enhanced parasitic NH3 oxidation above 400 degrees C. High levels of phosphorus increased low-temperature NOx conversion compared to low levels of phosphorus due to increase in oxidation capability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sensor performance was satisfactory and bidirectional at ambient room temperature (30 degrees C) and pressure (1 atm) conditions but the relative humidity (50%) at 30 degrees C had a detrimental impact on the sensing responses, therefore intermittent heating at 80 degrees C for several minutes between the sensing responses was provided to the sensing chip or one should use gas filter membranes to block humidity, thereby maintaining its constant performance with great ease and accuracy. The cyclic voltammetry revealed well-defined oxidation and reduction peaks, with excellent stability and reversibility. In a nutshell, heteroatom-doped N-CDs' nanocomposite material can revolutionize in a better environmental pollution monitoring by sensing gases in an extensively lesser response and recovery times.						sheikh, mohd abdullah/0000-0002-2050-608X													1976-4251	2233-4998				NOV	2024	34	9					2245	2257		10.1007/s42823-024-00751-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42823-024-00751-z		JUN 2024											WOS:001242721800001

Heterometallic Molecular and Ionic Isomers	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY												Numerous descriptions of structural isomerism in metal complexes do not list any molecular vs ionic isomers. At the same time, one of the most striking examples of structural isomerism in organic chemistry is molecular urea, which has the same atomic composition as the chemically distinct ionic ammonium cyanate. This iconic organic couple now meets its inorganic heterometallic counterpart. We introduce a new class of structural isomers, molecular vs ionic, that can be consummated in complex and coordinatively unsaturated polynuclear/heterometallic compounds. We report inorganic molecular and ionic isomers of the composition [NaCrFe (acac)(3)(hfac)(3)] (acac = acetylacetonate; hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate). Heterometallic molecular [Cr-III(acac)(3)-Na-Fe-II(hfac)(3)] (1m) and ionic {[Cr-III(acac)(3)-Na-Cr-III(acac)(3)](+)[Fe-II(hfac)(3)-Na-Fe-II(hfac)(3)](-)} (1i) isomers have been isolated in pure form and characterized. While both ions are heterobimetallic trinuclear entities, the neutral counterpart is a heterotrimetallic trinuclear molecule. The two isomers exhibit distinctly different characteristics in terms of solubility, volatility, mass spectrometry ionization, and thermal behavior. Unambiguous assignment of the positions and oxidation/spin states of the Periodic Table neighbors, Fe and Cr, in both isomers have been made by a combination of characterization techniques that include synchrotron X-ray resonant diffraction, synchrotron X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and DART mass spectrometry. The transformation between the two isomers that does take place in solutions of noncoordinating solvents has also been tested.

(Leguminosae), is a traditional Chinese medicine. It has long been used as the treatment of diabetic hyperlipidemia and diabetic constipation in Traditional Chinese Medicine formulae. Aim of the study: The present study was designed to investigate the anti-diabetic and renoprotective effects of Cassiae Semen extract (CSE) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Materials and methods: Quality control of CSE was performed using HPLC. CSE were orally administered at 27, 54 and 81 mg/kg dose to high-sucrose-high-fat (HSHF) diet and STZ-induced diabetic rats for 60 days. Body weight, glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism profiles were measured to assess the anti-diabetic effect of CSE. Oxidative stress markers and inflammatory factors were determined using commercial kits. Renal function related parameters were also measured. Histopathological examination of kidney was conducted for the validation of pathological changes in the diabetic rats. Immunohistochemical examination of kidney was measured to investigate the expression of RAGE in renal tissues. Results: Five compounds, including two anthraquinones and three naphtopyrones were simultaneously determined in CSE. Compared with diabetic control, groups treated with CSE exhibited an anti-diabetic effect, including a significant amelioration in body weight, glycemic control, oral glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism (P < 0.01). Moreover, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses decreased after oral administration of CSE (P < 0.01). CSE also showed protective effects on renal functions, decreasing the ratio of kidney/body weight, 24 h urine volume, 24 h urine protein, serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (P < 0.01). Additionally, renal protective effect was also observed in histopathological examination. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CSE downregulated the expression of RAGE. Conclusions: It turned out that CSE had both anti-diabetic and renoprotective effects in diabetic rats. CSE can be a potential agent in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications.

In this work, we present an overview of the most recent developments in MOFs related materials for photo/electrochemical decontamination. The strategies employed for the fabrication of MOFs related materials are summarized with discussion on the application performance as well as revealing the in-depth mechanisms. The state-of-art modification strategies including heterostructure, defect engineering (e.g., oxygen vacancy and ligand defect), regulation of physicochemical properties of MOFs related materials (e.g., hydrophobicity, hydrophilcity, lewis acidity, exposed crystal face, crystallinity degree, and conjugated degree), and construction of macroscopic architecture were summarized. Also, the representative works on eletro-Fenton, electro-assisted activation, photo-electro-Fenton, photo-electrocatalysis, microbial fuel cell (MFC), capacitive deionization (CDI), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), NO3- reduction reaction (NO3RR), photocatalysis, and photo-activation are highlighted. Moreover, the effects of structural modification on the performance optimization were systematically discussed. Besides, the bibliometrics method was used to explore the hot topics and potential future development. Finally, the unsolved issues and development opportunities of MOFs related materials in the field of photo/electrochemical decontamination are proposed. It is demonstrated that the obstacles and corresponding strategies proposed in this review could accelerate further development in this promising field.					mo, fan/KHT-4787-2024	Zhou, Qixing/0000-0003-4864-1715; Hou, Zelin/0000-0001-6306-9118; Mo, Fan/0000-0001-6272-781X													1385-8947	1873-3212				DEC 15	2022	450		4						138326	10.1016/j.cej.2022.138326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2022.138326		AUG 2022											WOS:000862700500001

However, the most efficient nitrification inhibitor for mitigating crop Cd accumulation remains to be elucidated, and whether and how changes in soil microbial structure are involved in this process also remains unclear. To address these questions, this study applied three commercial nitrification inhibitors, namely, dicyandiamide (DCD), 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), and nitrapyrin (NP), to pakchoi. The results showed that both DCD and DMPP (but not NP) could efficiently decrease Cd concentrations in pakchoi in urea- and ammonium-fertilized soils. In addition, among the three tested nitrification inhibitors, DMPP was the most efficient in decreasing the Cd concentration in pakchoi. The nitrification inhibitors decreased pakchoi Cd concentrations by suppressing acidification-induced Cd availability and reshaping the soil microbial structure; the most effective nitrification inhibitor was DMPP. Ammonia oxidation generates the most protons during nitrification and is inhibited by nitrification inhibitors. Changes in environmental factors and predatory bacterial abundance caused by the nitrification inhibitors changed the soil microbial structure and increased the potential participants in plant Cd accumulation. In summary, our study identified DMPP as the most efficient nitrification inhibitor for mitigating crop Cd contamination and observed that the soil microbial structural changes caused by the nitrification inhibitors contributed to decreasing Cd concentration in pakchoi.

The DPNR was prepared by incubation of the NR latex with urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature for an hour followed by centrifugation. FT-IR, H-1 NMR and( 13)C NMR measurements revealed significant differences between DPNR and NR after degradation at 150 degrees C; that is, cis-1,4-isoprene units of the DPNR isomerized to trans-1,4-isoprene units and vinyl groups, whereas those of NR reacted with oxygen radical and hydroxyl radical generated functional groups. The difference was attributed to an existence of proteins present in the nanomatrix structure, which adsorbed oxygen and water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Possibilities of X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy in the Total External Reflection Geometry for Studying Protein Films on Liquids	CRYSTALLOGRAPHY REPORTS												XANES spectra of protein films (hemoglobin and alkaline phosphatase) formed on the surface of a liquid subphase in a Langmuir trough have been obtained experimentally. The potential of X-ray absorption spectroscopy in the total external reflection geometry is demonstrated by the example of a protein film based on hemoglobin subjected to the action of urea. It is established that the presence of 0.09 M urea solution in the subphase enhances significantly the ability of hemoglobin to bind zinc and iron ions. Information about the local atomic environment of zinc ions bound with a hemoglobin molecule is obtained. It is shown that each zinc ion is coordinated by four ligands, two of which are amino acid residues of cysteine and histidine. The general concepts of the molecular mechanisms of accumulation of metal ions under the action of disturbing factors are formulated.

Among the technologies to treat NO pollution, photocatalytic oxidation under visible light is considered an effective means. This study describes photocatalytic oxi-dation to degrade NO under visible light with the support of a photocatalyst. MgO@g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts were synthesized by one-step pyrolysis of MgO and urea at 550 degrees C for two hours. The photocatalytic NO removal efficiency of the MgO@g-C3N4 heterojunctions was significantly improved and reached a maximum value of 75.4% under visible light irradiation. Differential reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was used to determine the optical properties and bandgap energies of the material. The bandgap of the material decreases with increasing amounts of MgO. The photoluminescence spectra indicate that the recombina-tion of electron-hole pairs is hindered by doping MgO onto g-C3N4. Also, NO conversion, DeNOx index, apparent quantum effi-ciency, trapping tests, and electron spin resonance measurements were carried out to understand the photocatalytic mechanism of the materials. The high reusability of the MgO@g-C3N4 heterojunction was shown by a five-cycle recycling test. This study provides a simple way to synthesize photocatalytic heterojunction materials with high reusability and the potential of heterojunc-tion photocatalysts in the field of environmental remediation.

These gas emissions are influenced by the amount and type of N-fertilizers applied and local climate. Recent studies showed potential of biochar and N-stabilizer compounds in minimizing CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions by regulating N-release from N fertilizers. The present study was aimed at determining and comparing the effects of biochar and N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide + dicyandiamide (N-stabilizer) on CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions from a pasture fertilized with cattle manure or urea. The study was conducted during 2015 and 2016 in an established bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L. Pers.). Treatments consisted of combination of N-sources (manure, and urea) and two mitigation technologies [pine hardwood biochar (BC) and N-stabilizer] along with control. Emissions of GHGs were measured from each plot using static chamber systems. Both BC and N-stabilizer applications with manure applied to the hay field significantly decreased N2O emissions by 42% and 45%, respectively, in the year-2, and emission factors compared to manure only treatment. Addition of N-stabilizer to urea had significantly decreased N2O emissions compared to urea alone, while BC had statistically insignificant effect although numerically lowered N2O emissions in both the years. Application of manure to the soil resulted in significantly higher CO2 emissions in both years and CH4 emissions in 2016 compared to unfertilized soil. Urea application had significant effect on CO2 emissions in 2016, while no effect on CH4 emissions compared to control. Application of either biochar or N-stabilizer did not significantly affect CO2 and CH4 emissions.

Urea was used as the precursor of C3N4, while titanium tetra-isopropoxide served as the source of titanium. Yellow nanocomposites were produced as compared to the formed white TiO2 and C3N4 nanomaterials. Transmission electron microscopic images and N-2 adsorption/desorption analysis revealed that the fabricated nanocomposites possessed a mesoporous structure and much larger surface areas as compared to the individual constituents. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements and thermogravimetric analysis were utilized to determine the composition and thermal stability of the C3N4-TiO2 nanocomposites. Tauc plots derived from the UV-vis absorption spectra revealed that the formation of the C3N4-TiO2 nanocomposites significantly narrowed the band gap energy, leading to a high visible light response in contrast to the individual TiO2 (similar to 3.2 eV) and C3N4 (similar to 2.8 eV) samples. The optimal composition of the C3N4-TiO2 nanocomposites was determined, and the new nanocomposite developed in this study exhibited high visible light activity in the photochemical oxidation of Rhodamine B, as compared to the mechanically mixed C3N4 and TiO2 sample. This significant improvement in photocatalytic activity may be attributed to the synergistic effects of the red shift in absorption and the large surface area.

Selective photocatalytic conversion of guaiacol using g-C3N4 metal free nanosheets photocatalyst to add-value products	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY												Valorization of lignin into high valuable chemical is a critical challenge. Its availability is a key factor for the development of viable lignocellulosic processes to replace fossil derived compounds. In this work, new insights on the high photocatalytic conversion of guaiacol (82%) as a lignin model compound was achieved, also, high selectivity to p-benzoquinone (59%), catechol (27%), and pyrogallol (6%) was obtained using metal-free pyrolyzed g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. To highlight the new insights, experimental parameters were modified to control the reaction mechanism to increase selectivity and photo-conversion. g-C3N4 photocatalyst was synthesized through urea calcination at 550 degrees C and the photocatalytic performance was assessed in terms of pyrolysis time, where higher time resulted in better photocatalytic activity. This effect was attributed to smaller structures and therefore better quantum confinement of the charges. The oxidation was promoted by OH radicals, which were detected through EPR operando mode and the addition of radical scavengers. A reaction pathway was proposed, in which the OH attacks guaiacol through a methoxy group. The photocatalytic reaction can be tuned using external oxidant agents such as O-2 and/or H2O2 to promote certain radical formation, enhancing conversion rates and promoting selectivity for a specific product, where yield shifting from p-benzoquinone to pyrogallol was experimentally observed.

HKL has diverse pharmacological activities and has protective effects in various disease models. However, the role and mechanism of HKL in treating chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain unclear. This study was designed to investigate whether HKL can alleviate CKD and the potential mechanism by which it acts. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed 0.75% w/w adenine feed for 3 weeks to induce CKD. HKL was administered by gavage at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Using a special kit, serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured. To assess renal pathology, periodic acid-Schiff and Masson's trichrome staining were conducted. Renal lipid profiles were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS). The results showed that the administration of HKL reduced Scr and BUN and alleviated renal tubular atrophy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in an adenine-induced CKD rat model. By using lipidomics, we identified 113 lipids (47 lipids in negative ion mode, 66 lipids in positive ion mode) that could be significantly reversed by HKL treatment in CKD rat kidneys. Most of these lipids belonged to the phosphatidylcholine (PC), ceramide (Cer), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and triacylglycerol (TAG) classes. Moreover, HKL improved fatty acid oxidation in the kidneys of CKD rats. In conclusion, this study found that HKL can protect against adenine-induced CKD, possibly through the regulation of lipid metabolism.

The results showed that when the mass ratio of urea to sodium tungstate is 0.1:1, the sample WO30.1 exhibited the highest response (740.3) to 100 ppm ethylene glycol at 200 degrees C. In addition, sample WO3-0.1 had excellent selectivity, repeatability, stability and moisture resistance. Due to the hierarchically self-assembled 3D structure, sample WO3-0.1 possessed the maximum number of mesopores, the vacant oxygen concentration of sample WO3-0.1 was twice as much as the sample WO3-0 without urea. Moreover, the growth mechanism of hierarchically self-assembled 3D WO3 was explored by discussing the synergistic effect of ammonium chloride and oxalic acid. Based on outstanding properties for ethylene glycol, the 3D WO3 prepared in this work will have practical significance and potential applications for environmental monitoring.																			0272-8842	1873-3956				JUL 1	2022	48	13					19206	19216		10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.213		MAY 2022											WOS:000807216500002

INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF FORMALDEHYDE INHALATION ON TXNIP AND NF-KB LEVELS IN RAT KIDNEY	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												Exposure to excessive formaldehyde (FA) has harmful effects on mammalian tissues. The aim was to investigate levels of oxidative stress in rat kidney due to chronic mild FA exposure. Sixteen female adult albino Wistar rats divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental animals were exposed to FA by inhalation to 10 ppm FA for 12 weeks, subchronic exposure. Kidney tissue Thioredoxin Interacting Protein and Nuclear factor-kappa B p105 levels were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The glutathione, malondialdehyde and advanced oxidation protein products levels were measured with the spectrophotometric methods. Serum albumin, creatinine, and urea concentrations were measured with enzymatic colorimetric assay. Compared to the control group, kidney GSH concentrations were significantly decreased in the FA group (P=0.015), while serum MDA concentration showed a significant increase (P=0.002). There was also a statistically insignificant decrease in tissue TXNIP and MDA and insignificant increase in tissue NF-kappa B p105 and AOPPs concentrations. Moreover, there was a strong positive correlation between tissue MDA and NF-kappa B p105 (r=0.841, P=0.001). Formaldehyde appears to cause cellular toxicity through oxidative damage because of disruption to oxidant/antioxidant system homeostasis. Subchronic administration of mild dose FA via inhalation to rats does not affect particular parameters on the apoptotic pathway.

The bamboo pulp cellulose is dissolved in NaOH-urea solution and oxidized as dialdehyde cellulose by NaIO4, which is continuously reacted with the residual urea and NaOH in the original reaction system to synthesize dicarboxyl cellulose. This one-step method greatly reduces the complexity and heterogeneity of the traditional two-step synthesis procedure, and avoids greatly the environmental pollution caused by the cellulose solvent.

Urine stabilization, which meanly means preventing enzymatic urea hydrolysis, receives increasing attention. Accordingly, this study developed a technique to stabilize fresh urine by heat-activated peroxydisulfate (PDS). The effect of three crucial parameters, including temperature (55, 62.5, and 70 degrees C), heat-activated time (1, 2, and 3 h), and PDS concentration (10, 30, and 50 mM) that affect the activation of PDS in urine stabilization were investigated. Nitrogen in fresh urine treated with 50 mM PDS at 62.5 degrees C for 3 h existed mainly in the form of urea for more than 22 days at 25 degrees C. Moreover, the stabilized urine could remain stable and resist second contamination by continuous and slow pH decrease due to PDS decomposition during storage. Less than 8% of nitrogen loss in stabilized wine was detected during the experiment. The investigation of nitrogen transformation pathway demonstrated that urea was decomposed into NH4+ by heat-activated PDS and further oxidized to NO2- and NO3-. The nitrogen loss during treatment occurred via heat-driven ammonia volatilization and N-2 emission produced by synproportionation of NO2- and NH4+ under acid and thermal conditions. Overall, this study investigated an efficient approach of urine stabilization to improve urine utilization in terms of nutrient recovery. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY												Background In this study we aimed to evaluate the effects of dilutional anemia resulting from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and its correction with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion on tissue oxygenation and renal function in diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Method 70 diabetic patients who underwent elective CABG and whose hematocrit values had been between 24-28% at any time during CBP were prospectively randomized and equally allocated to two groups: patients who received RBC during CPB (group I, n = 35) vs. did not receive RBC during CPB (group II, n = 35). Besides routine hemodynamic and biochemical parameters, biomarkers of ischemia and renal injury such as ischemia modified albumin (IMA), protein oxidation parameters [advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP), total thiol (T-SH)], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were measured in both groups. Results In group I, T-SH, NGAL and urea levels were found to be significantly increased postoperatively compared to preoperative measurements (p < 0.05). Also, postoperatively, NGAL, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and AOPP levels were higher in group I than group II (p < 0.05). Conclusion The correction of anemia with RBC transfusion in diabetic patients undergoing CABG could increase the risk of renal injury. Further studies verifying the effects of blood transfusions at the microcirculatory level are needed to optimize the efficacy of transfusions.

Three-week-old male BALB/c mice, fed with/without 0.005% quercetin for 6 weeks, were randomly divided into two experimental sets (loaded swimming and non-loading swimming tests). Our data indicated that dietary quercetin supplementation prolonged the exhaustive swimming time. In addition, lactic acid (LD) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) activities in serum were significantly decreased, while the levels of non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) in serum and the content of liver glycogen and muscle glycogen were significantly enhanced in dietary quercetin supplementation group. Furthermore, dietary quercetin supplementation significantly enhanced the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activities in serum, liver and gastrocnemius muscle and enhanced the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity in gastrocnemius muscle, but decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Meanwhile, dietary quercetin supplementation affected the mRNA expression of regulators factors involved in muscle damage and inflammation, glucose metabolism and gluconeogenesis, muscle mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and antioxidant related genes. Together, our data confirm that dietary quercetin supplementation can promote anti-fatigue capacity by promoting the antioxidant capacity and glycogen storage, as well as enhancing muscle function. Practical applications Quercetin is a natural polyphenolic flavonoid substance. Here we confirm that quercetin has anti-fatigue activity. Our study indicates that quercetin may be used as natural anti-fatigue functional food or drugs.

Tyrosinases have prospects for industrial use to remove phenols, also in biosensors, in bioorganic synthesis, and for a production of biocompatible adhesives (medical glues). Despite growing fields of potential applications, a selection of commercially available tyrosinases are currently limited to a single enzyme which is isolated from fruiting bodies of mushrooms. This article describes a preparation of recombinant tyrosinase from a bacterium Verrucomicrobium spinosum using a heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Recombinant V. spinosum tyrosinase has high specific activity (13,200 U/mg). A resistance of the enzyme was investigated to chemical agents used to denature proteins and keep poorly solvable proteins in a solution. The enzyme preserves activity in the presence of urea and retains at least a fraction of its enzymatic activity at concentrations of urea up to 4.5 M. An addition of sodium lauroyl sarcosinate to 1 or 2% activates the tyrosinase. Novel means of quantitatively expressing tyrosinase activity is described in this article. The method uses a set of parameters obtained from non-linear estimation of the progress curves and is suitable for enzymatic reactions which do not comply with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Tyrosinase may be used to introduce into proteins a post-translational modification which is a conversion of tyrosine residues (Tyr) into residues of 3,4-dioxyphenylalanine (DOPA). The presence of DOPA provides the polypeptides with a capability of strong molecular adhesion. Co-expression of tyrosinase and a recombinant protein mimicking marine mussel-encoded adhesive proteins resulted in obtaining of the protein in which at least a part of Tyr residues had been converted to DOPA. The DOPA-containing protein had high adhesion strength (2.5 MPa).					; Ramankulov, Yerlan/AAG-7450-2019; Shustov, Alexandr/K-1148-2013	Ramanculov, Erlan/0000-0001-6791-4497; Ramankulov, Yerlan/0000-0001-6786-3028; Shustov, Alexandr/0000-0001-9880-9382													0273-2289	1559-0291				JUL	2018	185	3					736	754		10.1007/s12010-017-2686-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-017-2686-y								29306981					WOS:000438285900013
J	Fujii, J; Osaki, T				Fujii, Junichi; Osaki, Tsukasa			Involvement of Nitric Oxide in Protecting against Radical Species and Autoregulation of M1-Polarized Macrophages through Metabolic Remodeling	MOLECULES												When the expression of NOS2 in M1-polarized macrophages is induced, huge amounts of nitric oxide (center dot NO) are produced from arginine and molecular oxygen as the substrates. While anti-microbial action is the primary function of M1 macrophages, excessive activation may result in inflammation being aggravated. The reaction of center dot NO with superoxide produces peroxynitrite, which is highly toxic to cells. Alternatively, however, this reaction eliminates radial electrons and may occasionally alleviate subsequent radical-mediated damage. Reactions of center dot NO with lipid radicals terminates the radical chain reaction in lipid peroxidation, which leads to the suppression of ferroptosis. center dot NO is involved in the metabolic remodeling of M1 macrophages. Enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, notably aconitase 2, as well as respiratory chain enzymes, are preferential targets of center dot NO derivatives. Ornithine, an alternate compound produced from arginine instead of citrulline and center dot NO, is recruited to synthesize polyamines. Itaconate, which is produced from the remodeled TCA cycle, and polyamines function as defense systems against overresponses of M1 macrophages in a feedback manner. Herein, we overview the protective aspects of center dot NO against radical species and the autoregulatory systems that are enabled by metabolic remodeling in M9-polarized macrophages.

Some antioxidant substances can improve stability of oils. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on the concentration of sulfhydryl groups, lipid peroxides, malondialdehyde, creatinine and urea in serum of rats fed high fat diet for 3 months. Material and Methods: Thirty six Wistar rats were equally divided into 6 groups: the control group on standard breeding diet (SB), oxidized oil (OU) group on SB with 10% oxidized oil, ALA10 group on SB with ALA 10 mg/kg of body weight (b.w.), OU+ALA10 group on SB with oxidized oil and ALA (10 mg/kg b.w.), ALA50 group on SB with ALA in a dose of 50 mg/kg b.w., OU+ALA50 group on SB with oxidized oil and ALA (50 mg/kg b.w.). Oil was oxidized in 180 degrees C for 6 h. Results: We observed decrease in concentration of protein sulfhydryl (PSH) groups in all study groups except for ALA10 vs. control group (C) and increase in OU+ALA10 and OU+ALA50 vs. OU; increase in the lipid hydroperoxide (LHP) concentration in OU, OU+ALA10 and OU+ALA50 vs. C and decrease in all study groups vs. OU; increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) in OU vs. all other groups. And also increase in creatinine and urea concentration in OU group. Conclusions: High fat diet rich in oxidized oil intensifies the lipid peroxidation process and oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. It can also impair kidney function. Administration of lipoic acid in a dose of 10 mg/kg b.w. inhibits the lipid peroxidation and protects sulfhydryl groups.																			0465-5893	2353-1339					2017	68	3					391	399		10.13075/mp.5893.00533	http://dx.doi.org/10.13075/mp.5893.00533								28512366					WOS:000401636100007
J	Hale, L; Hendratna, A; Scott, N; Gao, SD				Hale, Lauren; Hendratna, Aileen; Scott, Natalie; Gao, Suduan			Biochar enhancement of nitrification processes varies with soil conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Application of inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizers in agriculture can increase emissions of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, leaching of nitrate (NO3-), a groundwater contaminant hazardous to human health, and soil acidification. Soil amendment with biochar potentially mitigates these losses and undesirable outcomes. However, there have been considerable inconsistencies in reported impacts, likely owing to variable physiochemical characteristics of the biochar materials and/or the soil environment. This study methodically evaluated the impact of biochar soil incorporation on N transformation and underlying microbial processes using soils with varying biochar types, soil texture, soil moisture, and manure compost co- amendments. Laboratory incubations were conducted to monitor the fate of urea fertilizer N spiked in biochar amended and unamended soils by assaying soil ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-), and NO3- concentrations, pH, and abundances of soil nitrifiers; ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea (AOB and AOA) and Nitrospira with the capacity to perform complete ammonia oxidation (comammox). Soil moisture was a critical factor affecting N transformation processes, more so than biochar, but biochar did result in significantly different concentrations of N species in response to urea application. Biochar enhanced nitrification, more significantly in drier conditions and in sandy soil. Biochar offered some buffering potential in the neutral-alkaline, unsaturated soils, preventing >1 unit drop in pH compared to unamended soils. Co-application of biochar with manure composts enhanced nitrification slightly, which was evidenced by higher abundances of some soil nitrifiers at 4 weeks, although increases in nitrification rates were not statistically significant. Soil nitrifier populations tended to increase in response to a pinewood biochar, but trends differed for saturated soil, in soils of differing textures, or when different biochar materials were evaluated. Thus, when evaluating implications of biochar on the fate of mineral N fertilizer, soil moisture and other environment conditions should be considered.

Here, the dahlia flower-like nickel-based composites have been synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction, and was used as an efficient oxygen reduction reaction catalyst in a single chamber microbial fuel cell. The physical characterization of surface structure suggests the composites have successfully prepared. The MFC with Ni-melamine cathode can achieve obviously higher power density of 378.08 mW m(-2) than those of Ni-urea cathode (244.02 mW m(-2)) and Ni-dicyandiamide cathode (201.67 mW m(-2)). A series of electrochemical characterization suggests that Ni-melamine electrode possesses larger electrochemical active surface area, lower charge transfer resistance, and higher oxygen reduction performance than those of Ni-urea electrode and Ni-dicyandiamide electrode. The electrochemical measurements have also demonstrated that nickel-melamine composites can be involved in oxygen reduction reaction via a four-electron route due to the high-efficient electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the maximum power density of nickel-based composites is obviously increased with an increase of catalysts coating amounts. When the loading amounts are 4 mg cm(-2), the power density for nickel-based composites is improved to 1421.4 mW m(-2), which is 1.68 times higher than that of Pt/C due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies and nitrogen element. Thus, nickel-based composite is an effective and promising catalyst material for microbial fuel cell to substitute Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction application. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It was over-expressed in an insoluble fraction of E. coli cells, and recovered in the presence of 8 M urea via one-step IMAC purification. Monomeric and denatured PMMA-tag-fused VHH (VHH-PM) was successfully prepared via the reduction and oxidation of VHH-PM at a concentration less than 1 mg/mL in the presence of 8 M of urea. Furthermore, the VHH-PM was refolded with a recovery of more than 95% by dialysis against 50 mM TAPS at pH 8.5, because the genetic fusion of PMMA-tag resulted in a decrease in the apparent isoelectric point (pI) of the fusion protein, and its solubility at weak alkaline pH was considerably increased. The antigen-binding activities of VHH-PM in the adsorptive state were 10-fold higher than that of VHH without a PMMA-tag. The density of VHH-PM on a PMMA plate was twice that of VHH, indicating that the site-directed attachment of a PMMA-tag resulted in positive effects to the adsorption amount as well as to the orientation of VHH-PM in its adsorptive state. The preparation and immobilization methods for VHH-PM against hCG developed in the present study were further applied to VHH-PMs against four different antigens, and consequently, those antigens with the concentrations lower than 1 ng/mL were detected by the sandwich ELISA. Thus, the VHH-PMs developed in the present study are useful for preparation of high-performance and economical immunosorbent for detection of biomarkers.

Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity of Direct Z-Scheme K4Nb6O17/Carbon-Rich Melon Heterostructures	ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS												Melon (also known as graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4) holds promise for photocatalysis, but challenges such as severe charge recombination, low oxidation potential, and sluggish exciton dissociation hinder its performance. Herein, a series of carbon-rich, melon-based photocatalysts are synthesized via one-pot, temperature-induced condensation of urea with the addition of a trace amount of citric acid. The addition of citric acid enhances crystallinity, extends melon chains, increases the C/N ratio, and improves pi-pi layer stacking of heptazine units, thereby enhancing charge transport properties and visible-light harvesting capacity. These carbon nitride samples are then coupled with molten salt synthesized K4Nb6O17 crystals by a straightforward self-assembly method to construct 2D/2D heterostructure photocatalysts. Z-scheme electron transfer from K4Nb6O17 to the melon samples is established based on their work functions and band edge positions. This efficient charge transfer in the Z-scheme heterostructure facilitates the spatial separation of charge carriers, resulting in a nearly fivefold enhancement in photocatalytic performance compared to the individual constituents.

How to solve the problems of coagulation and intimal hyperplasia caused by the above factors is formidable in vascular replacement.

In an effort to find bioactive molecules, 25 novel thiazole-fused diosgenin molecules have been synthesized by an efficient reaction protocol. The chemistry involves the Oppenauer oxidation followed by double bond isomerization in a one-pot reaction, epoxidation, and the reaction of urea derivatives with the epoxyketone to synthesize the target compounds. These novel chimeric compounds were tested for their potential antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties. Antimicrobial studies against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative led to the discovery of some of these molecules as narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents against Bacillus subtilis bacteria. In preliminary cytotoxicity studies, 2-fluorophenyl derivative (10) inhibited the growth of several cell lines of the NCI-60 cell line panels including >93 % inhibition of UO-31 cell line. Furthermore, the hit antibacterial compounds are non-toxic to human cancer cell lines, and the cytotoxic compound is not active against the bacterial strains, showing the selective therapeutic potential of the chimeric compounds.

Biochar containing Fe-N structure (Fe3N-BC) was successfully prepared by using K2FeO4 as the iron source and urea as the nitrogen source. It can effectively activate PS and remove 98% of oxytetracycline (OTC) within 20 min. The main mechanism of PS activation by Fe3N-BC for OTC degradation is a non-radical pathway dominated by 1O2 generation and direct electron transfer. The formation of Fe-N structure in biochar changed the electron distribution on the catalyst surface and improved the electron transfer efficiency while inhibiting the leaching of iron ions, verifying the unique role of heteroatoms in ironbased catalysts. The study also identified the degradation intermediates of OTC and suggested possible degradation pathways. Showing that demethylation, deamidation and dehydroxylation are the prior steps for degradation. This study provides a new idea for the preparation of Fe-N structured biochar for OTC degradation.

The resultant systems were probed with electrochemistry and UV-Vis spectrophotometry to get an insight about the uranium species. In all the four systems prepared by in-situ mode, stabilization of uranium in U(VI) oxidation state in the form of oxo species was indicated. This halide anion free eutectic system was amenable to be used in SC CO2 extraction set-up.

The absorption peaks of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in Au NRs are highly sensitive to their surrounding medium and to its refractive index (RI) changes. However, no applications of NRs for detecting phase transitions have been reported. Here, we show that Au NRs effectively detect phase transitions of compressed compounds, liquid and solid, by measuring their RI. Owing to the direct interaction of the NRs with their surrounding medium, its subtle RI changes can be observed by the use of high-pressure absorption vis-NIR spectroscopy. We have applied a Au NR-based sensor in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) for monitoring the phase transitions of compressed water, its freezing to ice VI and at the subsequent solid-solid phase transition to ice VII, and the monotonic compression and solid-solid phase transitions in urea and thiourea.

There have been many in vivo studies on ginsenoside for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN), the most common diabetic micro -vascular complication and the main cause of diabetic morbidity and mortality.Aim of the study: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ginsenosides on DN by preclinical evi-dence and meta-analysis. Meanwhile, the main possible action mechanisms of ginsenosides against DN were also summarized.Materials and methods: We systematically searched PubMed, WOS, Embase, Cochrane, WanFang, Cqvip, CNKI and CBM databases from January 1, 2000, to November 15, 2021, to evaluate the animal experiments of ginsenosides for the treatment of DN. Finally, 30 animal experiments were included. Twelve outcome measures, including renal function indicators (24-h urine protein, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, creatinine clearance, uric acid, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio), oxidative stress biomarkers (GPX, MDA, SOD), inflammatory factors (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) were obtained by using RevMan 5.4 software for meta-analysis.Results: The results showed that except for no significant difference in CCr, other indicators such as 24h UP, SCr, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid and UACR were significantly decreased. It showed that ginsenoside could improve renal function in diabetes. Meanwhile ginsenoside significantly up-regulated antioxidant enzymes SOD and GPX, down-regulated MDA and inflammatory factors IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, indicating that ginsenoside may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.Conclusion: Ginsenoside can protect against the renal failure in diabetes through anti-inflammation, anti -oxidation, anti-renal fibrosis, anti-apoptosis/pyroptosis, regulation of blood glucose/lipid metabolism, etc. Which provides preclinical evidence for the application of ginsenoside in the treatment of DN.																			0378-8741	1872-7573				FEB 10	2023	302		A						115860	10.1016/j.jep.2022.115860	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2022.115860		NOV 2022						36341813					WOS:000886522000003

Scanning electron microscopy images showed many aggregated COFs crystals anchored on the irregular g-C3N4 surface to form 3D structures. The precursors (urea, melamine, and dicyandiamide) of g-C3N4 determined the porous structures and properties of the g-C3N4@COF materials. The hybrids possessed superior reactivity in Orange II removal (100%) compared to pristine g-C3N4 (10%) and COF (5%), benefiting from high-temperature pyrolysis to generate crystal carbon and modulate nitrogen doping. Besides, removal efficiency of target pollutants depended on the oxidant dosages (0.33-1.30 mM), initial concentrations of organics (10-40 mg/L), temperatures (5-45 degrees C), pHs (1.72-10.3), and anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, HCO3-, CO32-, and HCOO-). Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrated that non-radical singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was the dominant species for the oxidation of organic pollutants via electron transfer in the g-C3N4@COF/PMS system. It was inferred that the good balance between graphitization degree and nitrogen content benefited to enhancing the catalytic performance for the refractory pollutant degradation. The present investigation provides a new avenue for the design and construction of metal-free hybrid composites for environmental remediation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Genomic and phenotypic characterization of 26 novel marine bacterial strains with relevant biogeochemical roles and widespread presence across the global ocean	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Prokaryotes dominate global oceans and shape biogeochemical cycles, yet most taxa remain uncultured and uncharacterized as of today. Here we present the characterization of 26 novel marine bacterial strains from a large isolate collection obtained from Blanes Bay (NW Mediterranean) microcosm experiments made in the four seasons. Morphological, cultural, biochemical, physiological, nutritional, genomic, and phylogenomic analyses were used to characterize and phylogenetically place the novel isolates. The strains represent 23 novel bacterial species and six novel genera: three novel species pertaining to class Alphaproteobacteria (families Rhodobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae), six novel species and three new genera from class Gammaproteobacteria (families Algiphilaceae, Salinispheraceae, and Alteromonadaceae), 13 novel species and three novel genera from class Bacteroidia (family Flavobacteriaceae), and one new species from class Rhodothermia (family Rubricoccaceae). The bacteria described here have potentially relevant roles in the cycles of carbon (e.g., carbon fixation or energy production via proteorhodopsin), nitrogen (e.g., denitrification or use of urea), sulfur (oxidation of sulfur compounds), phosphorus (acquisition and use of different forms of phosphorus and remodeling of membrane phospholipids), and hydrogen (oxidation of hydrogen to obtain energy). We mapped the genomes of the presented strains to the Tara Oceans metagenomes to reveal that these strains were globally distributed, with those of the family Flavobacteriaceae being the most widespread and abundant, while Rhodothermia being the rarest and most localized. While molecular-only approaches are also important, our study stresses the importance of culturing as a powerful tool to further understand the functioning of marine bacterial communities.

Uric acid detection by hydrogen peroxide independent biosensors: Novel insights and applications	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL												Uric acid (UA) is one of the most electroactive low molecular weight compounds that can be electrochemically oxidized on the surfaces of numerous noble and non-noble electrocatalysts under applied polarization. Consequently, enzymatic determination of UA in model and real samples is complicated by possible interference between electrochemical and biochemical routes. Herein, a novel strategy for amperometric enzymatic hydrogen peroxide independent UA sensing at low concentrations ( e.g., below 50 mu M) is proposed. The UA-sensitive strategy relies on the use of screen printed electrodes modified by an electrodeposited hybrid functional sensing film comprising a non-noble electrocatalyst, a bioorganic layer containing enzyme uricase (UOx), and data acquisition enabling the biochemical transformation of UA to be distinguished from the electrochemical oxidation route. Performed selectivity test utilizing adenine, xanthine, urea, ascorbic acid, ethanol and glycerol did not reveal interferences during detection of UA. This proposed approach was tested for UA detection in model and fermentation samples. The quantitative results obtained in fermentation samples were validated through optical oxygen mini sensor studies and fluorescence-based bioassays.

Herein, we report a nonmetallic BN embedded graphitic carbon catalyst which was synthesized by a one-step co-pyrolysis method using boric acid, urea and ammonium iron citrate as the reactants. The obtained catalyst exhibits a high styrene selectivity of 94%. The existence of abundant carbonyl groups and BO species could correspondingly contribute more reaction sites and extra oxygen adsorption sites. A higher styrene formation rate of 5.8 mmol g(cat)(-1) h(-1) is thus achieved for our BN embedded graphitic carbon catalyst, whereas this value is 3.4 mmol g(cat)(-1) h(-1) for sole carbon nanotubes and 0.2 mmol g(cat)(-1) h(-1) for BN. Such promoted reactivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene is derived from the synergetic and collaborative effect of the nonmetallic BN and graphitic carbon catalyst.

Photoregenerable, Bifunctional Granules of Carbon-Doped g-C3N4 as Adsorptive Photocatalyst for the Efficient Removal of Tetracycline Antibiotic	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING												Environmental remediation employing semiconducting materials offer a greener solution for pollution control. Herein, we report the development of high surface area porous architecture of C3N4 nanosheets by a simple aqueous spray drying process. g-C3N4 nanosheets obtained by the thermal decomposition of urea-thiourea mixture are spray granulated to microspheres using 2 wt% poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) as binder. The post granulation thermal oxidation treatment resulted in in situ doping of carbon leading to improved photophysical properties compared to pristine g-C3N4. The C3N4 granules with surface area values of 150 m(2)/g rendered repetitive adsorption of tetracycline antibiotic (similar to 75% in 60 min) and the extended absorption in the visible region facilitated complete photocatalytic degradation upon sunlight irradiation (>95% in 90 min). The delocalized pi bonds generated after carbon doping and the macro-meso porous architecture created by the granulation process aided high adsorption capacity (70 mg/g). The photoregenerable, bifunctional materials herein obtained can thus be employed for the adsorption and subsequent degradation of harmful organic pollutants without any secondary remediation processes.

Herein, a porous ultra-thin carbon nitride with C-defect O-doping and advanced n - z* transition was customized by one-pot thermalinduced polymerization of molten urea assisted with paraformaldehyde. Via visible-light coupling peroxymonosulfate activation, the DCN-100 can completely photodegrade 2,4dichlorophenol, and rate constant is 136.6 and 37.9 times that of CN and DCN-100 without peroxymonosulfate. The light-absorption of DCN-100 surpasses 550 nm, specific surface area rises from 45.03 to 98.58 m2 /g, and charge behaviors are significantly improved. The effects of paraformaldehyde amount, PMS dosage, pH, 2,4-dichlorophenol concentration, different water-body, wavelength and recycling times on photodegradation performance were explored in detail. Via capture experiments, ESR, LC-MS, Fukui-function, TEXT toxicity assessment and DFT theoretical calculation, the main active substances, degradation pathway, intermediate toxicity and enhanced activity mechanism of DCN-100 were clarified. The research provides a cost-effective, high-efficiency and environmental-friendly photocatalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate for water remediating.																			1001-0742	1878-7320				JUN	2025	152						353	367		10.1016/j.jes.2024.05.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2024.05.012		MAY 2024						39617558					WOS:001248141700001

The as-synthesized Fe3O4 nanospheres with a uniform size from 16 to 18 nm, which can increase the reaction contact area and the active sites in the process of glucose detection. Benefiting from the particular nanoscale structure, the Fe3O4 nanospheres obviously enhanced the activity of electrocatalytic oxidation towards glucose. When the Fe3O4 nanospheres material was used for non-enzymatic glucose sensor, several electrochemical properties including the high sensitivity 6560 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) (0.1-1.1 mM), limit of detection 33 mu M (S/N=3) and good long-term stability were well demonstrated. Furthermore, Fe3O4 nanospheres electrode confirmed the excellent performance of selectivity in glucose detection with the interfering substances existed such as urea, citric acid, ascorbic acid, and NaCl. Due to the excellent electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solution, the Fe3O4 nanospheres material can be considered as a promising candidate in blood glucose monitoring.					sun, yuting/KVB-1917-2024														2045-2322					SEP 29	2020	10	1							16026	10.1038/s41598-020-73090-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73090-4													WOS:000577131600014

Oleic acid was used as the reaction medium. The morphology and chemical composition of the obtained Fe-CNNPs were characterized by multiple methods including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). It is interesting to find that the Fe-CNNPs showed higher catalytic activity than horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) can be catalytically oxidized in the presence of H2O2 to produce a color change in aqueous solution. As H2O2 can be generated in the oxidation process of glucose catalyzed by glucose oxidase (GOD), a novel sensitive method for the detection of glucose with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.29 mu M has been developed combined with the catalytic properties of GOD and Fe-CNNPs. The Fe-CNNPs with peroxidase mimetics activity may have potential applications in biotechnology field. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Survival in frozen states is a fascinating strategy made possible by evolving adaptations to produce cryoprotectant solutes. The hylid frog Boana pulchella thrives in South American regions with cold climates, remaining active while enduring sporadic subzero temperatures during winter. The species' metabolic changes during subzero exposure remain unclear. Therefore, we exposed B. pulchella to cooling and recovery, assessing plasma and tissue metabolite changes. Cooling significantly reduced urea concentrations in plasma (P = 0.033), muscle (P = 0.001), heart (P = 0.009), and brain (P = 0.041) compared to acclimation. Liver glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis were lower in cooling and recovery than in acclimation (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0117, respectively). Muscle glycogen synthesis was lower in recovery than acclimation (P = 0.0249). These results demonstrate B. pulchella's physiological strategies during subzero exposure, likely reflecting species-specific evolutionary adaptations for brief subzero exposures that enable winter survival in its natural habitat.					de Amaral, Marjoriane/GLU-9311-2022; Kucharski, Luiz/AAC-2036-2020; Vogt, Éverton/IUQ-8287-2023; Airton Ressel Simoes, Leonardo/HHN-7758-2022	Airton Ressel Simoes, Leonardo/0000-0002-3471-6758; Lopes Vogt, Everton/0000-0002-1545-0632; de Amaral, Marjoriane/0000-0003-4017-4243													0306-4565	1879-0992				OCT	2023	117								103705	10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103705								37714110					WOS:001124096300001

Eupatilin (EUP) is a natural flavone with multiple biological activities and has beneficial effects against various inflammatory disorders. However, whether EUP has a favorable effect on septic AKI remains unknown. Here, we examined the effect of EUP on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked AKI in mice. LPS-evoked renal dysfunction was attenuated by EUP, as reflected by reductions in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. LPS injection also induced structural damage such as tubular cell detachment, tubular dilatation, brush border loss of proximal tubules, and upregulation of tubular injury markers. However, EUP significantly ameliorated this structural damage. EUP decreased serum and renal cytokine levels, prevented macrophage infiltration, and inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-& kappa;B signaling cascades. Lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidation were increased after LPS treatment. However, EUP mitigated LPS-evoked oxidative stress through downregulation of NPDPH oxidase 4 and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. EUP also inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis in LPS-treated mice. Therefore, these results suggest that EUP ameliorates LPS-evoked AKI through inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.

The polymeric 4.40-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and palm-oil-based polyol were used for the PU modification. A 4:1 M ratio of NCO/OH was found to be successful in forming urea bonds in the CR-modified binder. The performance of CR and CR + PU-modified bitumen was compared with the most widely used SBS modification. The binders were subjected to conventional and rheological tests. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was utilized to evaluate the effect of aging. The use of 8 %CR and 4% PU together provided a considerable performance improvement over the use of CR alone and that this combined binder provided better plastic deformation resistance, and low-temperature behavior than the 4 %SBS modifi-cation. The chemical reaction between PU and CR prevented the decomposition and had a significant effect on increasing the storage stability. The use of PU with CR was found to reduce chain scission, condensation and oxidation caused by aging.

The antioxidant activity of keratin hydrolysates in polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrix has been studied using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under non-isothermal conditions. The experimental results have been evaluated and kinetic description of the oxidation induction periods have been carried out using the Bethelot-Hood temperature function. The length of induction periods has been assessed for all temperatures using the kinetic results. In order to compare the stabilizing effect of keratin hydrolysates, protection factors and antioxidant effectiveness have been calculated. The results have shown that the antioxidant activity of keratins strongly depends on the hydrolysis process. The protection factors decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing concentration of keratin. Based on our previous experience, we propose that the qualitative trend presented in this work can also be applied for other matrices than PEG. Keratin hydrolysates and their modifications with antioxidant properties significantly reduced formaldehyde emissions from urea-formaldehyde adhesives.

However, the potential impacts of these inhibitors on soil environments still needs to be evaluated using long-term experiments. Through a 6-year field observation, the effects of combined application of a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide, DCD) and a urease inhibitor (hydroquinone, HQ) on N2O emission, as well as soil ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in a maize (Zea mays L.) field in Northeast China were investigated. The results showed that annual soil N2O emissions were 0.466, 1.021 and 0.874 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for N0 fertilizer treatment (CK), Urea treatment (U) and Urea + DCD + HQ treatment (UDH), respectively. A significant linear correlation was found between the N2O accumulation in the first month after fertilizer application and the short-term precipitation (i.e., a period from 10 days before to 20 days after fertilizer application). The N2O emissions in the freeze-thaw period accounted for up to 42.5% of the year-round N2O emissions. The remarkable fluctuations of annual N2O emissions were observed (their coefficients of variation were 68.3%, 77.7% and 71.2% for CK, U and UDH treatments, respectively); these fluctuations were mainly attributed to the precipitation. The averaged N2O emission factors (EF) (0.308% and 0.227% for U and UDH treatments, respectively) were far less than the default mean EF of 1% proposed by (IPCC, 2006). An averaged N2O mitigation of 26.4% was fulfilled by UDH application. The results of quantitative PCR for soil nitrification and denitrification gene copy numbers measurement showed that UDH treatment significantly decreased the ammonia oxidation bacteria (AOB) amoA gene copy numbers by 74% on the 10th day after UDH application. No significant effects of combined application of DCD and HQ on microbial denitrification functional gene abundance were observed.					dong, Dong/JFJ-3808-2023														0167-1987	1879-3444				AUG	2018	180						82	90		10.1016/j.still.2018.02.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.02.010													WOS:000433653300009

The increased visible light absorption arising from the surface plasmon resonance of Ag and improved separation and transfer of photoinduced carriers over Ag/g-C3N4 composites were demonstrated by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and photoluminescence spectra, respectively. It was therefore proposed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Ag/g-C3N4 composites could be attributed to the extended light response range and enhanced charge separation due to the introduction of Ag nanoparticles.

The electrochemical performance of GO/AuNR/GCE for UA detection was investigated employing the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique. Central composite design (CCD) was applied to obtain the optimum composition of the GO and AuNR composite, which provide the highest possible UA oxidation peak current. The optimum composition was obtained at a GO concentration of 5 mg mL(-1) and AuNR volume of 10 mL. Under the optimum conditions, GO/AuNR/GCE showed acceptable analytical performance for UA detection with good linearity (concentration range of 10-90 mu M) and both a low detection limit (0.4 mu M) and quantitation limit (1.0 mu M). Furthermore, the proposed sensor exhibits superior stability, reproducibility, and selectivity using ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), urea, glucose, and magnesium as interferents. Finally, practical use of GO/AuNR/GCE was demonstrated by successfully determining the content of UA in human urine samples with the standard addition approach.

UV excitations and colour tuning of SrAlxOy:Eu<SUP>2+</SUP>,Dy<SUP>3+</SUP> nanophosphors prepared by solution-combustion	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS												Europium ion doped strontium aluminate (SrAlxOy:Eu2+,Dy3+) blue-green phosphors were obtained at low temperatures (500 A degrees C) by the solution-combustion of corresponding metal nitrate-urea solution mixtures, within 5-10 min. In this study the effect of a variation in the Sr:Al molar ratios on the product properties were investigated. The product's particle size as determined with the PHI 700 Nanoprobe varied between 50 nm (nanorods) and 0.2 A mu m (hexagonal platelets). X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that the hexagonal phase formed for the lower Sr:Al ratios and the monoclinic phase for the higher relative ratios. EDS (electron diffraction spectroscopy) confirm the change in relative Sr:Al ratios and also confirm the presence of the Eu and Dy dopands. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra revealed that europium ions were present in divalent and trivalent oxidation states. It was observed that the Sr:Al molar ratio significantly affects the crystalline structure of the material, the type of luminescence centers present, the ratio of Eu2+:Eu3+ ions and the maximum luminescent intensity of the broad emission bands.

Herein, we developed a robust synthesis technique consisting of electrochemical exfoliation under alternating currents and subsequent liquid-phase exfoliation to prepare highly uniform few-layer NbS2 nanosheets. The obtained few-layer NbS2 material has a 2D nanosheet structure with an ultrathin thickness of similar to 3nm and a lateral size of similar to 2 mu m. Benefiting from their unique 2D structure and highly exposed active sites, the few-layer NbS2 nanosheets drop-carted on carbon paper exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid with an overpotential of 90 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 83 mV dec(-1), which are superior to those reported for other NbS2-based HER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, few-layer NbS2 nanosheets are effective as bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen production by overall water splitting, where the urea and hydrazine oxidation reactions replace the oxygen evolution reaction.

The present study describes a two-step synthesis for the cobalt complex of tetra-2,3-(5,6-di-tert-butyl-pyrazino) porphyrazine (tBu-TPyzPzCo) starting from pivalil, 2,3-diaminomaleonitrile, metal salts, and urea. The product was ultrasonically impregnated onto carbon black (CB), wherein particle electrodes (tBu-TpyzPzCo/CB) were employed for the degradation of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) in a three-dimensional electrocatalytic system under xenon lamp. HPAM exhibited more efficient degradation in the presence of a supporting catalyst using the photoelectrocatalytic process than by photocatalytic or electrocatalytic oxidation or even the sum of the two in saline water. The effects of HPAM degradation on various parameters in the photoelectrocatalytic reactor, such as the catalyst dosage, following the application of a cell voltage and an electrolyte were investigated in detail. Hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals were determined as the main active species in the reaction. The reaction mechanism was also discussed.

The TEMPO-oxidized cellulose hydrogels (TCH) were prepared using microwave-assisted accelerated TEMPO-oxidation system. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) was grafted onto TCH with glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent and the products named as TCP. The hydrogels were characterized by SEM, FTIR, XPS, and elemental analyzer. The maximum adsorption capacities of Cu2+ and Pb2+ by TCP were 109.89 mg/g and 279.32 mg/g, respectively. TCP was a single molecule adsorption process with better fitting of the Langmuir model. Adsorption kinetics showed that the Pb2+ adsorption rate of TCP was higher than that for Cu2+. The Cu2+ affinity of TCP was higher than the Pb2+. The adsorption capacity of TCP for Cu2+ and Pb2+ was 58.26 mg/g and 91.96 mg/g, respectively, after five cycles.

Morphology and crystal structure of CuO modified printed electrode was analyzed through high resolution scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction technique. Linear sweep voltammetry and amperometry were used to study the electro-catalytic activity of sensor electrode.

Our results showed a significant increase in hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein product and protein carbonyl levels in the kidney of KBrO3 treated mice, compared with the control group. Nephrotoxicity was evidenced by a decrease in plasma uric acid and kidney glutathione levels, Na+-K+-ATPase, lactate dehydrogenase and catalase activities. Additionally, creatinine and urea levels significantly increased in the plasma and declined in the urine. Also, Kidney glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, metallothionein (MT1 and MT2) mRNA expression remarkably increased. These modifications in biochemical and molecular values were substantiated by histopathological data. Co-treatment with vanillin restored these parameters to near control values. Interestingly, vanillin proved to possess, in vitro, a stronger scavenging radical activity than vitamin C and Trolox. Thus, vanillin inhibited KBrO3-induced damage via its antioxidant and antiradical activities as well as its capacity to protect genes expression and histopathological changes.

Similarly, the overpotential of the anodic-coupled urea oxidation reaction (UOR) was only 1.3 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and 1.35 V at 100 mA cm(-2). Besides, the small impact resulting from the rapid bubble extraction within the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF nanoarrays ensured excellent HER cycling stability over 100 h at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2).

In this study, we investigate the effects of naringin, chlorogenic acid, and quercetin mixtures (NCQ) on renal fibrosis in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic aged rats and its underlying mechanisms for ten consecutive weeks. The oxidative defense system in the kidneys of treated rats was found to be improved. Several biomarkers were investigated including the blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid. Moreover, antioxidant parameters were evaluated and we found that superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, Na+-K+-ATPase activities, the nitric oxide production, the protein carbonyl, the advanced oxidation protein products, lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione levels were all significantly balanced and close to control values. In addition, NCQ restored renal injuries and fibrosis as assessed by histological method and molecular biology investigation of the matrix metalloproteinase, the transforming growth factor-beta TGF-beta, the tumor necrosis factor TNF alpha, and p53 expression.

However, very limited information is available for their toxic effects at environmentally relevant doses, limiting the evaluation of their health risks. In this study, cell viability assay and targeted metabolomic approach was used to evaluate the environmental dose (<100 mu g/L) effect of SCCPs on HepG2 cells. Cell viability was found to be decreased with increases in exposure dose of SCCPs. Exposure for 48 h to C-10-CPs resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability compared with 24 h, even at 1 mu g/L. SCCPs exposure altered the intracellular redox status and caused significant metabolic disruptions. As a kind of peroxisome proliferator, SCCPs specifically stimulated the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and long-chain fatty acids. Meanwhile, SCCPs exposure disturbed glycolysis and amino acid metabolism, and led to the up-regulation of glutamate metabolism and urea cycle. The toxic effects of SCCPs might mainly involve the perturbation of energy production, protein biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and ammonia recycling.

The effect of these dopants on the type of nitrogen species, nitrogen contents, and surface structure of graphene catalysts was investigated on their catalytic properties for oxidative removal of sulfur compounds in fuel oil. All of doped graphenes show the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen species, while the graphene doped with hexamethylenetetramine shows the highest amount of nitrogen with some content of amine group as well as pyridinc-N and pyrrolic-N. This N-doped graphene indicates the highest catalytic activity due to the type of nitrogen species, higher nitrogen content, and higher surface area. The resulting immobilized catalysts with MoO3 also show the similar trend in catalytic activities. Nitrogen doping increase the electron density of peroxo groups by donating electrons to Mo-centers which enhance the catalytic activity by decreasing the oxidation barrier.					afsharpour, maryam/AAB-3576-2019														1383-5866	1873-3794				NOV 1	2021	274								119014	10.1016/j.seppur.2021.119014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2021.119014		MAY 2021											WOS:000668938300003

The hydrogels were obtained by an oxidation process using the redox system KMnO4/NaHSO3 which leads to the formation of carbonyl and carboxyl groups with minimum polymer hydrolysis. The resulting oxidized samples as well as the native starches were extensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and wide angle X-ray scattering, among others. High gel fraction values and low degree of crystallinity were obtained in all the cases, which values vary slightly depending on the botanical source. High swelling capacity was observed for all the samples, which behave as hydrogels. The influence of the ionic strength and pH in the swelling capacity of the oxidized starches was also studied. The samples exhibit an anti-polyelectrolyte behavior and the water uptake increases at basic pH as the carboxylic groups become ionized. The hydrogels were also loaded with urea, potassium nitrate and ammonium sulfate as model fertilizers and their potential for controlled release was investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wu, B; Yeasmin, S; Liu, Y; Cheng, LJ				Wu, Bo; Yeasmin, Sanjida; Liu, Ye; Cheng, Li-Jing			Sensitive and selective electrochemical sensor for serotonin detection based on ferrocene-gold nanoparticles decorated multiwall carbon nanotubes	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL												Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in neural activities. 5-HT deficiency is clinically related to several psychiatric disorders. Therefore, sensitive 5-HT detection is critical in the diagnosis of diseases associated with neurological disorders. Here we developed a sensitive electrochemical sensor utilizing ferrocene covalently linked gold nanoparticles on multiwall carbon nanotubes (FeC-AuNPs-MWCNT), electrocatalytic nanocomposites, to enhance 5-HT detection. FeC-AuNPs-MWCNT modified screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) provide catalytic activity towards 5-HT oxidation from both FeC and AuNPs along with the high conductance from the carbon nanotube network. The FeC-AuNPs-MWCNT was synthesized by chemically reducing AuNPs on MWCNT surfaces and covalently attaching FeC to the AuNPs. Square wave voltammetry analyses confirmed that the electrocatalytic nanocomposite modified electrodes improved the electrocatalytic activity towards 5-HT oxidation, 61 times higher than the unmodified SPCE. The sensor exhibited a sensitive response to 5-HT over a wide dynamic range from 0.05 mu M to 20 mu M, a limit of detection of 17 nM (S/N = 3), excellent reproducibility, and high selectivity towards 5-HT against several interferers, including ascorbic acid, urea, uric acid, dopamine, and glucose. The sensor was successfully demonstrated to detect sub-mu M 5-HT in urine samples with satisfactory recoveries (98.3-104.9%) and a low relative standard deviation of less than 3%. This sensitive, selective, and cost-effective electrochemical sensor shows great promise in direct 5-HT analysis for clinical applications.

Reline also affects the speciation of the goldprecursor forming gold chloro-complexes, stabilizing Au+ species, leading to an easier reduction and avoiding the otherwisefast disproportionation reaction. Such a capability is however lostin the presence of large amounts of water, where water replaces thechloride ligands in the precursor speciation. In addition, relineacts as a weak stabilizing agent, leading to small particles (<3nm) and narrow distributions although agglomerates quickly form. Suchproperties are maintained in the presence of water, indicating thatit is linked to the urea stabilization rather than the hydrogen-bondingnetwork. This work has important implications in the field of greensynthesis of nanoparticles with small sizes, especially for biomedicaland health care applications, due to the nontoxic nature of the componentsof deep eutectic solvents in contrast to the conventional routes. Nontoxic, eco-friendly, and biodegradableeutectic mixturescan replace external reducing and stabilization agents in the synthesisof metal nanoparticles.

Well-known applications of chemical looping include combustion and methane reforming, where phase interactions in oxygen carriers play important roles in determining the process performance. In this study, we systematically investigate the interactions between various phases in Ni-Cu-Al2O3 mixed oxides oxygen carriers, which were prepared from layered double hydroxides precursors, synthesized hydrothermally using urea and metal nitrates. It appears that the addition of 32-45 wt% Al2O3 was sufficient to prevent sintering effects over 100 redox cycles at 800 degrees C, 1 atm, using methane as the fuel. The oxide phases and their compositions were determined using a set of complementary analytical techniques, allowing us to establish relationships between (i) the compositions of the mixed oxides, (ii) the chemical activity of the various types of lattice oxygen present and (iii) the distributions of gaseous products of chemical looping methane oxidation. We found that the mutual doping between NiO and CuO leads to enhanced lattice oxygen activities, whilst the solid solution of NiAl2O4 and CuAl2O4 leads to reduced lattice oxygen activity in the spinel phase, which also turns out to be particularly resistant to carbon deposition. The generality of the composition - activity - performance relationship is demonstrated by the successful prediction of the product distributions of methane oxidation based on solely the elemental compositions of the oxygen carriers. These findings enable the rational formulation of NiCu-Al2O3 oxygen carriers for methane conversion with precise control of product selectivity.

J	Queiros, J; Malça, J; Freire, F				Queiros, Joao; Malca, Joao; Freire, Fausto			Environmental life-cycle assessment of rapeseed produced in Central Europe: addressing alternative fertilization and management practices	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												This article presents a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of rapeseed produced in Central Europe (France, Germany and Poland), addressing different fertilization and management practices. Two alternative fertilization scenarios were compared (on the basis of the most common fertilizer types used in Europe, namely nitrogen, phosphate P2O5, and potash K2O fertilizers) and two different scenarios of soil management practices were assessed (taking into account climate and soil type prevalent in each region). Six environmental impact categories were investigated: abiotic depletion; global warming; acidification; eutrophication; ozone layer depletion; and photochemical oxidation. Results showed that the choice of fertilizer type had significant implications in the environmental impacts. Calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) manufacturing had considerably higher greenhouse gas emissions than urea production, due to the use of nitric acid in the former. In terms of field emissions, ammonia and nitrate released following the application of nitrogen fertilizers dominated the acidification and eutrophication impacts. Nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) compounds showed particularly high impacts in terms of photochemical oxidation, as a result of sulfur dioxide emissions from manufacturing. The remaining fertilizers (P2O5 and K2O) hardly contributed to the impacts. Soil carbon change associated with different agricultural management practices significantly contributed to the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of rapeseed production, but important soil carbon stock variations were calculated: between 938 (release) and 271 kg CO(2)eq/1000 kg dry seeds (sequestration) due to different standard soil organic carbon contents in the three rapeseed production systems and alternative tillage methods in the reference scenarios of land management.

Here, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the effect of quercetin on diabetic nephropathy and summarize its possible mechanisms. We searched in four databases PubMed, Web of Sciences (WOS), Cochrane and Embase from inception to May 2021 and ultimately included 20 animal studies in this review. A total of 12 outcome measurements including renal function indexes, oxidative stress biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines were extracted for meta-analysis using RevMan 5.4 software. Apart from creatinine clearance and uric acid with no significant difference, quercetin significantly decreased the levels of renal index, serum/plasma creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine protein, urine albumin, malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity. In short, quercetin improves renal function and attenuates the renal oxidative stress level and inflammatory response in DN animal models. Its possible action mechanisms include anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-fibrosis, and regulation of renal lipid accumulation.

In this study, a 3D nanostructured Ni3N-Co3N catalyst was prepared by using a versatile urea glass method, and was tested as an anode catalyst for a glucose fuel cell. The synthesized Ni3N-Co3N exhibits uniform particle dispersion in structure, morphology, and composition, and has a interpenetrating three-dimensional network structure. Notably, the Ni3N-Co3N significantly improved the catalytic activity of glucose oxidation compared to Ni3N, Co3N, and conventional activated carbon electrodes. The superior electrochemical performance could be attributed to its porous structure and unique properties, which provided a fast transport network for charge and mass transfer as well as good synergetic effect. The glucose fuel cell equipped with a Ni3N-Co3N anode achieved 30.89 W m(-2) power and 97.66 A m(-2) current densities at room temperature. This investigation provides potential directions for the design of cost-effective bimetallic catalysts for a wide range of glucose fuel cell applications.

The current study explored the protective effects of dietary zinc against diabetic renal injury and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In experiments, ZnSO4 at 15mg/kg was intragastrically administrated into type 2 diabetes mellitus-like Wistar rat models daily for continuously 53days. Biochemical assay was performed to detect serum fasting blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and insulin. The H&E staining, immunohistochemical assay, and Western blotting were performed to detect the changes in kidney tissues. In results, dietary zinc reduced the lipid peroxidation malondialdehyde levels and enhanced the total anti-oxidation capacity levels. The pathological changes in diabetic kidney were improved. The percentage of autophagy-associated LC3-II positive cells was lowered. Western blot levels of LC3-II proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated GRP78 proteins were lowered. In conclusion, dietary zinc can relieve ER stress and autophagy in diabetic kidney to improve kidney conditions of type 2 diabetes mellitus-like rat models. These findings may be useful to treat patients with diabetic renal injury.																			0973-3930	1998-3832				APR	2019	39	2					340	345		10.1007/s13410-018-0681-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13410-018-0681-7													WOS:000469514100016

Investigations on anticorrosive, thermal, and mechanical properties of conducting polyurethanes with tetraaniline pendent groups	POLYMERS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES												This article describes the synthesis of conducting hybrid polyurethanes from novel tetraaniline-diol as Gly-TAni (glycidol with TAni). A new diol Gly-TAni has been synthesized in a simple process using tetraaniline (TAni) and glycidol via SN2 reaction in a single-step process. The asymmetric diol (Gly-TAni) and polyols (PTMEG and TMP) were reacted with isophorone diisocyanate at OH:NCO ratio of 1:1.2 to obtain ?NCO terminated hybrid conducting polyurethanes. These were subjected for curing under atmospheric moisture to obtain conducting polyurethane-urea coatings. The conducting coatings showed considerable enhancement in thermal and mechanical stabilities. All these conducting coatings films showed excellent corrosion resistance (on mild steel electrode) with an increase in the percentage of Gly-TANi (5 to 15wt%). The films of these hybrid polyurethanes containing pendent tetraanilines showed good surface conductivity in the range of 3.69x10(-4) to 2.21x10(-3)S/cm. The electrochemical investigation showed 2 single electron oxidation and 2 single reductions reversibly, centred around tetraaniline segments present in the polymer.

Tantalum-containing compounds, such as tantalum oxynitrides, can catalyze ORR in acid, with the degree of oxidation proposed to play a central role in controlling the ORR activity. Herein, we report the incorporation of aliovalent ions in tantalum oxynitrides (Ta-ON) and their effect on the ORR activity in acid. We synthesize Ta-ON by utilizing urea as the nitrogen source and use aliovalent (Ti4+) and isovalent (Nb5+) substitutions to evaluate the influence of the aliovalent substitution on the ORR activity. We found that an aliovalent Ti4+ substitution increases the ORR activity by 3x, which we attribute to improved electrical conductivity and increased ORR active sites. In comparison, isovalent Nb5+ substitution or carbon inclusion as oxycarbonitride did not positively affect the ORR activity. Our finding points to the important role of defects and conductivity in the Ta-based ORR electrocatalysts. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.

However, several of the existing models depend on using high concentrations of hepatocyte differentiation-promoting compounds, namely glucose, insulin, and dexamethasone, which is among the reasons that have hampered their use for modeling metabolism-related diseases. This work focused on modulating glucose homeostasis and glucocorticoid concentration to improve the suitability of a mesenchymal stem-cell (MSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cell (HLC) human model for studying hepatic insulin action and disease modeling. MethodsWe have investigated the role of insulin, glucose and dexamethasone on mitochondrial function, insulin signaling and carbohydrate metabolism, namely AKT phosphorylation, glycogen storage ability, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, as well as fatty acid oxidation and bile acid metabolism gene expression in HLCs. In addition, we evaluated cell morphological features, albumin and urea production, the presence of hepatic-specific markers, biotransformation ability and mitochondrial function. ResultsUsing glucose, insulin and dexamethasone levels close to physiological concentrations improved insulin responsiveness in HLCs, as demonstrated by AKT phosphorylation, upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of Irs2 and gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation pathways. Ammonia detoxification, EROD and UGT activities and sensitivity to paracetamol cytotoxicity were also enhanced under more physiologically relevant conditions. ConclusionHLCs kept under reduced concentrations of glucose, insulin and dexamethasone presented an improved hepatic phenotype and insulin sensitivity demonstrating superior potential as an in vitro platform for modeling energy metabolism-related disorders, namely for the investigation of the insulin signaling pathway.

Herein, bimetallic oxide CoMn2O4 hierarchical porous nanosheets (CoMn2O4 HPNSs) were constructed using glucose/urea deep eutectic solvent (DES) as sustainable solvent and self-formed sacrificial carbon templates. The prepared CoMn2O4 HPNS exhibited outstanding peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation performance, achieving the rapid degradation of refractory organic compounds in wastewater, including 5-sulfosalicylic acid (100%), acetaminophen (100%), oxtetracycline (100%), and sulfamethoxazole (91%) within 20 min. This excellent performance was attributed not only to the synergistic catalytic effect of Co-Mn bimetals, but also to the hierarchical porous structure which exposes more active sites and accelerates the migration of PMS and organic pollutants. In addition, CoMn2O4 HPNS also showed excellent reusability and high stability in multiple cycles of degradation. The active species quenching results and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements revealed that SO4.- greatly contributed to organic degradation, while O-1(2) and .OH also involved. Moreover, a series of other transition metal oxides (Co3O4, Fe2O3, Mn3O4, NiO, and CoFe2O4) with hierarchical porous nanosheet structures were successfully fabricated with this method. This study provides a simple, general, and low-cost strategy for fabricating hierarchical porous transition metal oxides, which are promising for the environmental remediation or many other applications in the future.

This study highlights the superior performance of PANI-MIP/ITO over PANI-MIP/GCE for sensing Phe, with clear and distinct redox responses. Molecular computation helps to understand the interaction mechanism between PANI and Phe, where molecular crowding, aggregated clusters, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi stacking facilitate stable interactions. We tested the specificity of Phe sensing by PANI-MIP with different amino acids such as cysteine, tryptophan, and tyrosine as well as organic molecules such as ascorbic acid, allantoin, sucrose, and urea, confirming its remarkable electrochemical efficiency. The oxidation response curve yielded a limit of detection of 4.88 mu M and a limit of quantification of 16.3 mu M, comparable to or better than earlier reported sensors. This work demonstrates the promise of MIP-based electrochemical sensing. It also lays the groundwork for future investigations into optimizing PANI-MIPs with nanocomposites to develop more selective and stable sensors.

In this regard, oilseed meals are valuable alternatives, as it is anticipated that the sticky potential of these meals is linked to their protein content. This work focuses on the protein parameters (primary and/or secondary structures) that could impact the adhesiveness of sunflower meals. The proteins contained in these meals were first separated from the other components and identified using electrophoresis. Oilseed meals contain several families of proteins: globulins, albumins, prolamins, and oleosins. Sunflower meal is mainly composed of globulin (53%) and albumin (45%). The protein structures have then been either oxidized with H2O2 (in the presence or not of NaOH) or physically treated by microwave (MW). The oxidation treatment cleaves the protein backbone and creates smaller peptides, while the MW process converts alpha-helices into random coils. The adhesive potential of these treated proteins was evaluated by using shear tests onto wood panels. The results demonstrate that the primary and secondary structures of globulins are key parameters toward the sunflower protein meal adhesivity.

The spinel phase was analyzed using XRD, and the spinel Co-O-Al bond were identified at the band region of 779 cm-1 in the FT-IR spectrum. SEM revealed a marigold flower like pattern in the morphology, while TEM showed a cubic morphology, and elemental composition are confirmed by EDAX. Additionally, optical characteristics of the pristine and Cu doped samples were thoroughly analyzed by UV- DRS spectroscopy. EPR measurement confirmed the presence of free electrons which are crucial for electrical conductivity. XPS analysis further verified the oxidation states of each element. To investigate the thermoelectric properties of CoAl2O4 and CuxCo1-xAl2O4 (x=0.02-0.10), hall measurements were conducted, revealing the highest carrier concentration was found as 8.728x1016 cm-3 for Pristine CoAl2O4. Notably, the highest electrical conductivity was found as 2.48x10- 2 Scm- 1, while the lowest thermal conductivity measured was 0.0522 W/mK for Cu0.10Co0.90Al2O4. The Seebeck co-efficient for the pristine sample was 730 mu V/K, which decreased to 427 mu V/K for Cu0.10Co0.90Al2O4. The highest power factor observed was 5.1 nWcm-1K-2 for Cu0.10Co0.90Al2O4. This study presents the obtained results and the fabrication of a wearable device using p-type (CoAl2O4) and n-type (Cu0.10Co0.90Al2O4) materials, achieving an output of 3.6 mV with a temperature difference of 1.5 K".					veluswamy, pandiyarasan/F-7056-2016														0925-8388	1873-4669				JAN 5	2025	1010								177513	10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.177513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.177513		NOV 2024											WOS:001360615500001
J	Mitran, G; Nguyen, TL; Seo, DK				Mitran, Gheorghita; Nguyen, Tam Le Phuong; Seo, Dong-Kyun			The influence of complexing agents on the cobalt-based catalysts properties and activities	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY												In this study, CoAl2O4 samples were synthesized using sol-gel method in the presence of citric acid (CoAlCA), malic acid (CoAlMA), oxalic acid (CoAlOA) and urea (CoAlU) as complexing agents. The presence of cubic spinel structure for both CoAl2O4 and Co3O4 phases was confirmed by XRD. FTIR analysis emphasized that the composition of Co3+ ions decreased in order: CoAlOA (50.3 %) > CoAlU (41.8 %) > C oAlMA (40.7 %) > CoAlCA (24.3 %), which denotes that the presence of oxalic acid as complexation agent favors cobalt oxidation from Co2+ to Co3+ and, consequently, the expansion of Co3O4 phase. In the presence of citric acid, as a complexing agent, tetrahedral Co2+ ions prevailed and CoAl2O4 is the dominant phase. The catalytic performances of CoAl2O4 spinel oxides have been evaluated in lactonization of 1,4-butanediol, coupled with acetophenone hydrogenation and in the Claisen-Schmidt condensation reaction of benzaldehyde with acetophenone and the results provided a good relationship between Co3+/Co2+ ratio, the reactants conversion and the products yield.

An electrochemically reduced nitrogen-doped graphene oxide-modified glassy carbon electrode (ERNGO/GCE) was developed for the determination of carbendazim (CBZ) in food samples. The surface morphology of the modified electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed to demonstrate the large electrode surface and fast electron transfer of the ERNGO/GCE. Electrochemical behaviors of CBZ at different electrodes were studied by voltammetry. Experimental results showed that the ERNGO/GCE achieved better performance for the electrochemical oxidation of CBZ than either the bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) or the nitrogen-doped graphene oxide-modified GCE (NGO/GCE). Under optimized conditions, the ERNGO/GCE exhibited a wide linearity of 5.0 +/- 850 mu g/L with a detection limit of 1.0 mu g/L (signal-to-noise ratio = 3). Application of our proposed method in food products was shown to be practical and reliable.																			1936-9751	1936-976X				MAY	2017	10	5					1479	1487		10.1007/s12161-016-0708-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-016-0708-y													WOS:000399014600035

After pyrolysis and template removal, the resulting material is a mesoporous carbon that can be additionally doped with N, B and K during prepyrolysis impregnation. In addition, the influence of doping on the morphology, crystallinity and stability of the synthesized carbons was studied using X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, thermogravimetry, Raman and IR spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. While the nanocasting process is effective for the formation of mesopores, KOH and urea do not modify the textural properties of carbon. The use of H3PO4 as a dopant, however, led to the formation of an AlPO4 compound and resulted in a solid with a lower specific surface area and higher microporosity. All doped solids present higher thermal stability as a positive effect of the introduction of heteroatoms to the carbon skeleton. The phosphorus-doped sample has better oxidation resistance, with a combustion temperature 120-150 degrees C higher than those observed for the other materials.

Oxidative damage has been proposed as a possible mechanism involved in Pb toxicity. The current study was carried out to evaluate the antioxidant activities of zinc (Zn) supplement against lead acetate-induced kidney injury in rats. In this study, adults male rats were treated for 15 days with Pb (0.344 g/kg body weight (bw)) associated or not with Zn (10 mg/kg bw). Our study showed that supplementation with Zn prevented renal dysfunction as indicated by plasma biomarkers (urea, uric acid, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase levels) and oxidative stress-related parameters (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein carbonyl, advanced oxidation protein product, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and vitamins (A, E)) in kidney tissue. The corrective effect of Zn on Pb-induced kidney nephrotoxicity recovered normal kidney histology. Overall, this study indicates that Zn alleviated the toxic effects of this heavy metal on renal tissue, suggesting its role as a potential antioxidant and nephroprotective agent.					elfeki, abdelfattah/LKL-6561-2024	GARGOURI, Manel/0000-0002-1803-3308; elfeki, abdelfattah/0009-0009-9949-1367													0748-2337	1477-0393				JUL	2018	34	7					469	480		10.1177/0748233718770293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0748233718770293								29702030					WOS:000433617800004

Several IMDs have serious consequences for the affected neonates. Newborn screening for IMDs is conducted by measuring specific metabolites between 3 and 7 days of life. Herein, we analyzed the incidence, spectrum, and genetic characteristics of IMDs in newborns in the Zhuzhou area.Methods: Tandem mass spectrometry was conducted on 90,829 newborns who were admitted to the Women and Children Healthcare Hospital of Zhuzhou and requested for screening for IMDs. These newborns were subsequently subjected to next-generation sequencing and further validated using Sanger sequencing.Results: 30 IMDs cases were found in 90,829 cases of newborns screened for IMDs, and the overall incidence was 1/3,027. The incidence of amino acid, organic acid, fatty acid oxidation and urea cycle disorders were 1/8,257, 1/18,165, 1/7,569, and 1/45,414, respectively. Additionally, 9 cases of maternal IMDs were found in our study, and unreported gene mutations of 3 cases IMDs were identified.Conclusion: Our data indicated that IMDs are never uncommon in zhuzhou, meanwhile, we also found that primary carnitine deficiency was the only disorder of fatty acid oxidation in Zhuzhou, and the incidence (1/7,569) was higher than the national level, organic acid metabolic diseases are mostly inherited. Therefore, our study has clarified the disease spectrum and genetic backgrounds, contributing to the treatment and prenatal genetic counseling of these disorders in this region.

Over the past few decades, global interest in achieving greater output through intensive fertilization has been a growing trend. The fertilizer based on urea or ammonium mainly yields ammonium, which is then transformed to nitrate through the oxidation process that is biologically mediated. Nitrate tends to accumulate differently in distinct crop plants and distinct components of agricultural commodities based on species, crop variety, genetic history, environmental circumstances, harvest phase, post-harvest storage conditions, agronomic variables, nature, and fertilizer application rate. The current article highlights various factors that could directly or indirectly contribute to the accumulation of nitrates in different parts of crop plants and discusses strategies to minimize the accumulation of nitrates in farm produce, thus ensuring healthy food supply and protecting the environment from the accumulation of nitrates.

The objective of this study was to determine whether small molecule metabolites contribute to the pathogenesis of CSF. Birefly, serum metabolomics of CSFV Shimen strain-infected piglets were analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-Q-TOF/MS) in combination with multivariate statistical analysis. In CSFV-infected piglets at days 3 and 7 post-infection changes were found in metabolites associated with several key metabolic pathways, including tryptophan catabolism and the kynurenine pathway, phenylalanine metabolism, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid and urea cycles, branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. Several pathways involved in energy metabolism including fatty acid biosynthesis and beta-oxidation, branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were significantly inhibited. Changes were also observed in several metabolites exclusively associated with gut microbiota. The metabolomic profiles indicate that CSFV-host gut microbiome interactions play a role in the development of CSF.

The loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), is a recurrent epigenetic biomarker across various types of cancers. Therefore, accurately quantifying 5hmC holds great potential for various clinical applications. However, distinguishing 5hmC from 5mC using conventional methods is challenging. In this study, we developed a rapid and highly selective electrochemical sensor for label-free detection of 5hmC-enriched DNAs using a graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-modified gold transducer. Two-dimensional g-C3N4 sheets were synthesized via direct pyrolysis of urea under ambient or nitrogen atmospheres and drop-cast onto the gold electrode. Subsequently, 5hmC-containing DNAs were immobilized onto g-C3N4 via hydrogen bonding between the -OH of 5hmC and the-NH2 of g-C3N4. The developed sensor demonstrated high sensitivity, selectivity, remarkable reproducibility, and stability, with a low oxidation potential (0.23 V) and an extremely low limit of detection (0.316 pM) for 5hmC. The sensor was also tested for its applicability to real samples using primary liver samples from mouse models, in which 5hmC levels were diminished due to either Tet gene knockout or hepatocellular carcinogenesis. The sensor effectively detected reduced genomic 5hmCs in TET-deficient livers and hepatocellular carcinomas compared to controls. Thus, this novel sensing strategy has the potential to develop clinically applicable sensors for early cancer diagnosis and prognosis evaluation by rapidly quantifying genomic 5hmC.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

In this view, we synthesized a new perovskite-type sphere-like strontium stannate (SrSnO3) material by a simple co-precipitation method with the assistance of urea, and it was utilized as an electrocatalyst for the electrochemical sensing of anti-inflammatory drug mesalamine (MES). Furthermore, the synthesized SrSnO3 was systematically characterized by FE-SEM, EDX mapping, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS. The electrochemical properties of the synthesized SrSnO3 were examined by using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry techniques; these techniques indicated that SrSnO3 exhibited better electrochemical oxidation of MES when compared with previously reported catalysts. The SrSnO3-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) showed a higher peak current response with a lower detection potential towards sensing MES when compared to unmodified GCE with a broader linear response range (0.01-212 mu M), lower detection limit (0.002 mu M), and higher sensitivity. Moreover, the modified electrode demonstrated better repeatability, reproducibility, stability, and selectivity even in the presence of potentially interfering compounds such as common inorganic and biological species, which did not disturb the oxidation signal of MES. Furthermore, real sample analysis was performed to investigate the practical feasibility of the synthesized SrSnO3 in human urine, lake water and commercial MES drug samples with satisfactory recovery results. The reported sensor system provides an operative measure for sensing a very low MES content with high selectivity in real sample analysis.

In present study, prebiotics supplementation was given to rats following HFHS diet feeding. The results showed that prebiotics significantly lowered the HFHS-diet associated elevated levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipids, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea, creatinine, uric acid and total proteins. Prebiotics significantly restored the HFHS-diet induced decrease in total anti-oxidant capacity. The levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, total oxidation status, malondialdehyde, paraoxonase and arylesterase were not significantly different in HFHS-Prebiotics group as compared to control group. Histological analyses of liver, intestine and kidney tissues in HFHS-group showed cytoplasmic vacuolation, mucosal damage, hepatic triad abnormalities, eccentric nuclei, focal necrosis, tubular congestion and neutrophil infiltration which were significantly improved in HFHS+Prebiotics group suggesting ameliorative potential of prebiotics. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that prebiotics possess therapeutic potential in ameliorating HFHS-diet associated alterations in metabolic profile, oxidative stress markers and histological architecture in intestine, liver and kidney tissues.

Methods: The concentrate of PUFAs was obtained by the complex formation method with urea. Liposomes were obtained by the extrusion method adding alpha-tocopherol. Hyperlipidaemia among the rats was induced by an atherogenic diet. Results: With the development of oxidative stress caused by the atherogenic diet, redox imbalance was observed within the animals, accompanied by a high intensity of lipid peroxidation processes and depletion of antioxidant protection. The level indicators of the oxidation products, the activity of the glutathione antioxidant system and the total content of antioxidants in the blood were restored to the level of intact rats by introducing liposomal suspension with the seal fat and concentrate of PUFAs to the experimental animals.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Contact angle, Zeta potential and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed; the obtained results showed that NCF has potential slow-release nitrogen properties. Additionally, the FTIR and XPS measurements revealed that NCF has various oxygen-containing active functional groups along with nitrogen-containing groups. A soil leaching test and the release kinetic model fitting of total nitrogen showed that NCF released nitrogen more slowly and over a longer time than urea, with nitrogen still being released after 70 days. Further, a mechanism study was performed, which revealed that NCF has a dual release performance that is similar to that of biochar and "dissolved black nitrogen." Moreover, the total nitrogen release behavior of NCF was dominated by the multi-effects of the coal carbon carrier, including electrostatic attraction, the unconventional formation of hydrogen bonds, and decomposition of the nitrogen-containing groups. Furthermore, the application of NCF in both soil types (Lou and Loessal soil) stimulated the germination rate of spinach seeds and improved the chloroplast pigment content as well as the nutritional quality of spinach leaves. These results suggest that abandoned weathered coal may be fully utilized in the mining area and that NCF may have promising potential in improving plant quality and sustainable agriculture applications.

The characterization of the polyphenolic compounds in the extracts was conducted using UV-Vis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry techniques. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was evaluated in vitro by DPPH, FRAP, H2O2, and NO scavenging tests and in vivo by measuring the total oxidative status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), oxidative stress index (OSI), 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-Oxo-dG), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT), and total thiols (SH). Inflammation was evaluated by measuring nuclear factor-kB-p65 (NfkB-p65) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation with IL-1 beta, IL-18, and gasdermin D. Liver and renal toxicity was determined following transaminases (ALT and AST), creatinine, and urea. The experimental results indicated that A. dracunculus and A. abrotanum ethanol extracts have moderate in vitro antioxidant activity and had in vivo antioxidant activity and an anti-inflammatory effect by NfkB-p65, IL-1b, IL-18, and gasdermin D serum level reduction.

A phenyl-ethyl side chain with low surface energy was grafted into NH2-MIL-101(Fe) through a post-synthetic modification (PSM) method. As a result, a novel MIL-101(Fe)-1-(4-(ethyl)phenyl)urea (named MIL-101(Fe)-EPU) was synthesized. Basic morphology, crystal structure, and chemical bond features of MIL-101(Fe)-EPU were retained after PSM. Nitrogen X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed the successful introduction of the phenyl-ethyl side chain, and this transformation increased its hydrophobicity and water stability. Contact angles of MIL-101(Fe)-EPU to water raised from 59.6 to 140.4 degrees. And its structure maintained intact after 72 h water exposure, indicating higher stability than parent NH2-MIL-101(Fe). In the photocatalysis reaction with visible light and oxidant donor (H2O2), MIL-101(Fe)-EPU demonstrated a degradation efficiency of tetrabromobisphenol A with a reaction rate at 0.0313 min(-1). The predominant reaction mechanism was OH center dot oxidation. The acid condition was beneficial for this photocatalysis reaction and high stability was observed. Besides, photocatalysis efficiency, crystal structure, and chemical structures were all retained in different actual water mediums, suggesting high adaptability of MIL-101(Fe)-EPU. In general, hydrophobic group grafting using a PSM method endows MIL-101(Fe)-EPU the potentiality as photocatalyst for organic contaminant elimination from water.					liang, YU/IYT-4334-2023	liang, YU/0009-0007-3922-3454													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2021	28	48					68560	68571		10.1007/s11356-021-14834-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14834-1		JUL 2021						34275082					WOS:000673708500019

In this study, graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were prepared from two different precursors (urea and melamine) and used as the support to anchor ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticle (Ru/g-C3N4) for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of LA to GVL. The resulting catalyst prepared from urea precursor (Ru/UCN) showed 100% LA conversion and nearly theoretic GVL yield of 99.8% under mild condition. Detailed characterizations of the Ru/g-C3N4 suggested that Ru showed different interactions with the g-C3N4 supports from two different precursors. Ru nanoparticles exhibited smaller size and better dispersion on the g-C3N4 support from urea (UCN) than that from melamine (MCN). The XPS result indicated that more electron rich Ru degrees species on the Ru/UCN catalyst also contributed to the higher catalytic activity of the Ru/UCN. Furthermore, the Ru/UCN catalyst was demonstrated high stability in acidic reaction medium and remained highly reactive after recycled for 5 times. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Beyond glucose: alternative sources of energy in glioblastoma	THERANOSTICS												Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults. With a designation of WHO Grade IV, it is also the most lethal primary brain tumor with a median survival of just 15 months. This is often despite aggressive treatment that includes surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Based on the poor outcomes and prevalence of the tumor, the demand for innovative therapies continues to represent a pressing issue for clinicians and researchers. In terms of therapies targeting metabolism, the prevalence of the Warburg effect has led to a focus on targeting glucose metabolism to halt tumor progression. While glucose is the dominant source of growth substrate in GBM, a number of unique metabolic pathways are exploited in GBM to meet the increased demand for replication and progression. In this review we aim to explore how metabolites from fatty acid oxidation, the urea cycle, the glutamate-glutamine cycle, and one-carbon metabolism are shunted toward energy producing pathways to meet the high energy demand in GBM. We will also explore how the process of autophagy provides a reservoir of nutrients to support viable tumor cells. By so doing, we aim to establish a foundation of implicated metabolic mechanisms supporting growth and tumorigenesis of GBM within the literature. With the sparse number of therapeutic interventions specifically targeting metabolic pathways in GBM, we hope that this review expands further insight into the development of novel treatment modalities.

In CKD, increased levels of oxidative stress and uraemic retention solutes, including urea and advanced glycation end products, enhance non-enzymatic post-translational modification events, such as protein oxidation, glycation, carbamylation and guanidinylation. Alterations in enzymatic post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and methylation are also detected in CKD. Post-translational modifications can alter the structure and function of proteins and lipoprotein particles, thereby affecting cellular processes. In CKD, evidence suggests that post-translationally modified proteins can contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis, and induce vascular damage or prothrombotic effects, which might contribute to CKD progression and/or increase cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD. Consequently, post-translational protein modifications prevalent in CKD might be useful as diagnostic biomarkers and indicators of disease activity that could be used to guide and evaluate therapeutic interventions, in addition to providing potential novel therapeutic targets. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with several alterations in protein post-translational modifications. Here, the authors examine the evidence of these alterations, their links with CKD progression and cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD, and their potential clinical applications. Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications, including oxidation, carbamylation, guanidinylation and glycation, can be enhanced in chronic kidney disease (CKD) owing to increases in oxidative stress, inflammation and retention of uraemic solutes.These alterations in post-translational protein modifications might contribute to the pathophysiology of CKD.Mechanistically, protein modifications in CKD can contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, vascular damage and/or prothrombotic effects, thereby accelerating CKD progression and increasing cardiovascular risk.Specific alterations in enzymatic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and methylation, might also contribute to the pathophysiology of CKD and cardiovascular disease.Post-translational modifications are highly valuable diagnostic and prognostic disease biomarkers and represent interesting potential therapeutic targets, although additional research focus and investment will be required to translate this potential.

Electrochemical energy conversion presents a promising bridge to mitigate energy shortage issues and minimize the ecological implications by synergy with the ever-increasing sustainable energies (e.g., wind and solar). It thus calls for exploring high-activity, low-cost, and long-durability electrocatalysts to facilitate the electrochemical reactions involved in electrochemical energy conversion systems. This review focuses on summarizing the recent progress in the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts for several important electrochemical redox reactions which are critical to implement conversion between electrical energy and chemical energy, especially for bifunctional electrocatalysts applied in a single electrochemical conversion system, including water electrolyzers with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), zinc-air batteries with the OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and fuel cells with small molecule (e.g., glucose, urea, and hydrazine hydrate) oxidation reactions (MOR) and the ORR. Special emphasis has been placed on investigating the progress of electrocatalyst synthesis and strategies for improving the electrocatalytic performance and the associated devices' performance in terms of activity, stability, power density etc. We also put forward the major challenges and prospects in the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts for potential applications in a variety of energy devices.					wen, zhenhai/D-7165-2011; Ding, Yichun/G-8182-2016	Ding, Yichun/0000-0002-7441-800X													2050-7488	2050-7496				APR 14	2019	7	14					8006	8029		10.1039/c9ta00833k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta00833k													WOS:000464414200002
J	Yang, ZR; Guo, ZW; Yuan, CQ				Yang, Zongrong; Guo, Zhiwei; Yuan, Chengqing			Effects of MoS2 microencapsulation on the tribological properties of a composite material in a water-lubricated condition	WEAR												The severe abrasion wear of water-lubricated stern bearings usually occurs in the low-speed, heavy-duty working conditions. Consequently, it is vitally important to improve the anti-friction and tribological properties of composite stern bearings. The compound molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is a priority additive for enhancing the tribological properties of composites. However, the water capillary effect in the defects in the MoS2 crystal can easily lead to oxidation and failure of the lubrication properties of MoS2. In order to eliminate the chemical oxidation of MoS2 in a humid environment, MoS2 was microcapsulated to improve the chemical stability of MoS2 in a humid environment. In this reported work, urea formaldehyde (UF) microcapsules loaded with MoS2 as the core material were synthesized using in-situ emulsion polymerization. The synthesized microcapsules were added to a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) matrix to prepare composites. The ZCuSn(10)Zn(2) bronze which widely utilized in as the water-lubricated bearing bushing in watercraft was chosen as counterparts material. The tribological properties of the composites modified with microcapsules were investigated using a CBZ-1 tribometer under different running conditions, and the surface morphology of the tested composites was analyzed by using a scanning electron microscope. The test results revealed that the tribological property of the composites filled with the MoS2-containing microcapsules was better than the composite that lacked the MoS2 microcapsules. The composites containing the MoS2 microcapsules exhibited lower sliding friction and a smoother surface morphology, which was the result of the protection provided by the microcapsule walls. The UF walls of microcapsules isolated the steam produced by water and fiction, which delayed the oxidation of the MoS2 crystals. Upon fracturing of the walls of the microcapsules, the encapsulated molybdenum disulfide was released between the friction pairs, which reduced the friction coefficient and adhesion wear. This reported study also provided an experimental basis for structural design and performance enhancement of water-lubricated bearings.

Here we present the first enrichment of a thermophilic representative with a sequenced genome, which facilitates the search for adaptive strategies and for traits that shape the evolution of Thaumarchaeota. Candidatus Nitrosocaldus cavascurensis has been enriched from a hot spring in Ischia, Italy. It grows optimally at 68 degrees C under chemolithoautotrophic conditions on ammonia or urea converting ammonia stoichiometrically into nitrite with a generation time of approximately 23 h. Phylogenetic analyses based on ribosomal proteins place the organism as a sister group to all known mesophilic AOA. The 1.58 Mb genome of Ca. N. cavascurensis harbors an amoAXCB gene cluster encoding ammonia monooxygenase and genes for a 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway for autotrophic carbon fixation, but also genes that indicate potential alternative energy metabolisms. Although a bona fide gene for nitrite reductase is missing, the organism is sensitive to NO-scavenging, underlining the potential importance of this compound for AOA metabolism. Ca. N. cavascurensis is distinct from all other AOA in its gene repertoire for replication, cell division and repair. Its genome has an impressive array of mobile genetic elements and other recently acquired gene sets, including conjugative systems, a provirus, transposons and cell appendages. Some of these elements indicate recent exchange with the environment, whereas others seem to have been domesticated and might convey crucial metabolic traits.

However, the conventional method for the synthesis of oxynitrides using ammonia as a nitrogen source is dangerous. In this work, we successfully synthesized two layered tantalum oxynitrides, K1.35LaTa2O6.65N0.35 and K1.4Ca2Ta3O9.6N0.4, via a topochemical nitridation process using urea as a solid nitrogen source. Employing different characterization methods, we determined the structure and composition of layered oxynitrides. Furthermore, using Pt as a co-catalyst, these two layered oxynitrides showed excellent photocatalytic performances under visible light irradiation. In contrast to ammonia, urea process provides easy access for the synthesis of layered oxynitrides and sheds new light on the design of effective visible light-driven photocatalysts.					chen, wenqian/GRS-6775-2022; wang, jiajun/JRW-6032-2023	chen, wenqian/0000-0001-7946-8957													1477-9226	1477-9234				MAR 7	2023	52	10					3127	3136		10.1039/d2dt03470k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2dt03470k		FEB 2023						36789731					WOS:000933232700001

However, the performance of MoS2-derived tribofilms falls short when compared to other commercially available antiwear additives. The primary objective of this study is to improve the tribological performance of MoS2 as an additive for lithium-based greases. This was achieved by functionalizing the particle with hydrophilic molecules, such as urea. Experimental results indicate that the urea-functionalized MoS2 (U-MoS2) leads to a notable decrease in the coefficient of friction of 22% and a substantial reduction in the wear rate of 85% compared to its unmodified state. These results are correlated with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation of U-MoS2 to theorize two mechanisms that explain the improved performance. Urea has the capability to reside both on the surface of MoS2 and within its interlayer spacing. Weakened van der Waals forces due to interlayer expansion and the hydrophilicity of the functionalized U-MoS2 surface are catalysts for both friction reduction and the longevity of tribofilms on hydrophilic steel surfaces. These findings offer valuable insights into the development of a novel class of lubricant additives using functionalized hydrophilic molecules.					Arole, Kailash/GOP-0906-2022; Kabir, M.

The effect of dietary non-protein nitrogen content on the meat quality of finishing lambs	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												The effect of increasing the non-protein nitrogen content of low-fibre finishing diets on the meat quality of South African Mutton Merino wether lambs was investigated. Four similar dietary treatments were formulated with different non-protein nitrogen contents (16.6 g/kg, 28.3 g/kg, 40 g/kg, and 51.7 g/kg) on a dry matter basis. The study was conducted over 71 days. Muscle lipid content was higher on the 40 g/kg compared to 16.6 g/kg and 28.3 g/kg non-protein nitrogen diets. Myristic acid and total saturated fatty acid content of lamb muscle tissue was higher, whereas the total unsaturated fatty acid content of the same tissue was lower following a high dietary non-protein nitrogen content. A high nonprotein nitrogen diet (51.7 g/kg) reduced conjugated linoleic acid content of adipose tissue, compared to 28.3 and 40 g/kg non-protein nitrogen treatments. Malonaldehyde content of fresh lamb meat was higher on the 28.3 g/kg compared to the 16.6 g/kg non-protein nitrogen diet. The malonaldehyde content of the treatment containing 40 g/kg non-protein nitrogen was higher than the 51.7 g/kg when stored for 90 days. Therefore, the non-protein nitrogen content of low-fibre lamb finishing diets does not affect mutton fatty acid composition and quality parameters. Protein quality and its effect on ruminant meat quality requires more attention.

The razor clam Sinonovacula constricta, a bivalve living in intertidal mudflat with a deep-burrowing lifestyle, often faces a high concentration of ambient ammonia. However, there is less available information concerning the toxic effects of ammonia on razor clam and its molecular mechanisms of adaptation to ammonia stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ammonia exposure on the gill and hepatopancreas of razor clam by transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that the median lethal concentration of ammonia was 244.55 mg/L for 96 h. A total of 1,415 and 306 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the gill and hepatopancreas, respectively. The functional annotation showed that DEGs of the gill were mainly involved in the regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process, nitrogen compound transport, and amide transport. The DEGs of the hepatopancreas were mostly enriched in oxidation-reduction process, response to stress, and amine metabolic process. The expression levels of NH3/NH4+ transporting channels and H+ excreting-related genes, including Rhesus glycoproteins (Rh), Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), Na+/H+ exchanger, V-ATPase (VHA), and carbonic anhydrase (CA), were upregulated significantly in the gill (p < 0.05). In addition, the expression levels of glutamine and urea synthesis-related genes that played vital roles in ammonia detoxification, such as glutamine synthetase (GS), arginase (ARG), and argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), were also increased obviously in the hepatopancreas (p < 0.05). Taken together, our results indicate that the synergistic action of ammonia excretion in the gill and ammonia metabolism in the hepatopancreas might be the mechanism through which the clams tolerate to environmental ammonia. This study provides a molecular basis for the better evaluation of the responding mechanism of ammonia tolerance.

Magnetosomes reportedly possess intrinsic enzyme mimetic activity similar to that found in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and can scavenge reactive oxygen species depending on peroxidase activity. Our previous study has demonstrated the phototaxis characteristics of Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 cells, but the mechanism is not well understood. Therefore, we studied the relationship between visible-light irradiation and peroxidase-like activity of magnetosomes extracted from M. magneticum strain AMB-1. We then compared this characteristic with that of HRP, iron ions, and naked magnetosomes using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as a peroxidase substrate in the presence of H2O2. Results showed that HRP and iron ions had different activities from those of magnetosomes and naked magnetosomes when exposed to visible-light irradiation. Magnetosomes and naked magnetosomes had enhanced peroxidase-like activities under visible-light irradiation, but magnetosomes showed less affinity toward substrates than naked magnetosomes under visible-light irradiation. These results suggested that the peroxidase-like activity of magnetosomes may follow an ordered ternary mechanism rather than a ping-pong mechanism. This finding may provide new insight into the function of magnetosomes in the phototaxis in magnetotactic bacteria. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The urea:wood residue w/w ratio was varied from 0:1 to 100:1, and the intrinsic (surface chemistry) and extrinsic (morphology, specific surface area, etc.) properties of the N-doped biochar were systematically investigated. Notably, the urea:wood residue w/w ratio played a significant role in tuning the N species composition in the N-doped biochar. A higher urea:wood residue w/w ratio resulted in greater at.% of graphitic N and higher specific surface area. The results show that the catalyst prepared with urea:wood residue w/w ratio of 100:1 (NC800-20) manifested the greatest catalytic activity as PMS activator for organics removal due to its highly favorable combination of intrinsic (highest at.% graphitic N) and extrinsic (excellent specific surface area) properties. The catalyst loading, PMS dosage and pH were found to be operationally crucial for PMS activation. Under the best condition, the NC800-20 can be used to degrade various organic pollutants. The recyclability of NC800-20 was studied and while the catalytic activity gradually deteriorated over successive cycles, it can be completely restored by simple calcination at 500 degrees C. The used catalyst was extensively characterized, revealing insights into the mechanism of PMS activation. The prevailing mechanism for PMS activation was the nonradical pathway. Overall, this research provides insights into preparing N-doped biochar with favorable extrinsic and intrinsic properties from biowaste for sustainable pollutant removal via PMS activation.

J	Wang, XF; Zhang, L; Zou, JW; Liu, SW				Wang, Xiaofei; Zhang, Ling; Zou, Jianwen; Liu, Shuwei			Optimizing net greenhouse gas balance of a bioenergy cropping system in southeast China with urease and nitrification inhibitors	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Efforts to advance our knowledge on the potential of bioenergy instead of fossil fuels in terms of mitigating climatic impact are in urgent need. No data is currently available on the use of urease and nitrification inhibitors in costal saline bioenergy cropping systems. An overall accounting of net greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) affected by combined effects of urease inhibitor hydroquinone (HQ) and nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) amendment was examined in a coastal saline Jerusalem artichoke bioenergy cropping system. The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was determined by the difference between soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) and net primary production (NPP) using static chamber method. Urease and nitrification inhibitors amendment increased the NPP but exerted a suppression effect on soil RH over the Jerusalem artichoke cropping system. A trade-off relationship was observed by decreasing soil N2O but stimulating soil CH4 emissions following HQ+DCD amendment. The plots combined urea with HQ+DCD application increased soil CH4 by 167% while decreased N2O by 16% as compared to with urea only in the bioenergy cropping system. On average, the fertilizer N-induced emission factor of N2O was estimated to be 0.25% across the fertilized plots. Compared with urea, the plots with urea and HQ+DCD resulted in a further decrease by 37% and 15% in estimated NGHGB and GHGI over the Jerusalem artichoke cropping system, respectively. Overall, Jerusalem artichoke production would achieve higher biomass as source of biofuels but lower climatic impacts, particularly when together with urease and nitrification inhibitors amendment in coastal saline soils.

The starting materials are easily accessible and instructions on how to make the explosives are described on the Internet. Safety considerations raise the need to detect these substances quickly and in low concentrations using simple methods. Conventional methods for the detection of these substances require sophisticated, electrically operated, analytical equipment. The simpler chemical detection methods are multistep and require several chemicals. We have developed a simple, one-step method that works similarly to a pH test strip in terms of handling. The analytical reaction is based on an acid-catalyzed oxidation of an electron-rich porphyrin to an unusually stable radical cation and dication. The detection limit for the peroxide-based explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), which is very frequently used by terrorists, is 40 ng and thus low enough to detect the substance without direct contact via the gas phase. It is sufficient to bring the stick close to the substance to observe a color change from red to green. Nitrates and chlorates, such as ammonium nitrate, urea nitrate, or potassium chlorate, are detected by direct contact with a sensitivity of 85-350 ng. A color change from red to dark brown is observed. The test thus detects all homemade explosives and distinguishes between the extremely impact-, shock-, and friction-sensitive peroxides and the less sensitive nitrates and chlorates by color change of a simple test strip.

Exercise plasma metabolomics and xenometabolomics in obese, sedentary, insulin-resistant women: impact of a fitness and weight loss intervention	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM												Insulin resistance has wide-ranging effects on metabolism, but there are knowledge gaps regarding the tissue origins of systemic metabolite patterns and how patterns are altered by fitness and metabolic health. To address these questions, plasma metabolite patterns were determined every 5 min during exercise (30 min, similar to 45% of (V) over dotO(2peak), similar to 63 W) and recovery in overnight-fasted sedentary, obese, insulin-resistant women under controlled conditions of diet and physical activity. We hypothesized that improved fitness and insulin sensitivity following a similar to 14-wk training and weight loss intervention would lead to fixed workload plasma metabolomics signatures reflective of metabolic health and muscle metabolism. Pattern analysis over the first 15 min of exercise, regardless of pre- versus postintervention status, highlighted anticipated increases in fatty acid tissue uptake and oxidation (e.g., reduced long-chain fatty acids), diminution of nonoxidative fates of glucose [e.g., lowered sorbitol-pathway metabolites and glycerol-beta-galactoside (possible glycerolipid synthesis metabolite)], and enhanced tissue amino acid use (e.g., drops in amino acids; modest increase in urea). A novel observation was that exercise significantly increased several xenometabolites ("non-self" molecules, from microbes or foods), including benzoic acid-salicylic acid-salicylaldehyde, hexadecanol-octadecanol-dodecanol, and chlorogenic acid. In addition, many nonannotated metabolites changed with exercise. Although exercise itself strongly impacted the global metabolome, there were surprisingly few intervention-associated differences despite marked improvements in insulin sensitivity, fitness, and adiposity. These results and previously reported plasma acylcarnitine profiles support the principle that most metabolic changes during submaximal aerobic exercise are closely tethered to absolute ATP turnover rate (workload), regardless of fitness or metabolic health status.

In the glucose-urea-metallic salt method, glucose as the carbon template plays a significant role in the formation of diffusion-beneficial structural properties of Ru/SiO2-GUS, and also induceds the modification of the electronic state of Ru. Ru/SiO2-GUS exhibited higher catalytic activity compared with the catalyst prepared with the impregnation method. The catalytic performance of Ru/SiO2-GUS was further enhanced with the addition of either K or Csddthe addition order and amount strongly affecting the catalytic performance. When the ratio of K/Cs to Ru is 2, the alkali metal (KOH/CsOH) solution is added in the homogeneous solution of glucose, urea, RuCl3 and the colloidal silica, the promotion effect of K/Cs is the strongest, particularly under lower reaction temperatures. However, the promotion effects of K and Cs are different as reveled by the combined results of H-2-TPR, XPS and NH3-TPSR. More NH3 can be absorbed on KeRu/SiO2-GUS and the electron density of Ru decreased. By contrast, more metallic Ru formed on Cs-Ru/SiO2-GUS, facilitating N-2 recombination.

Moringa oleifera-based feed supplement protects against renal ischaemia/reperfusion injury via downregulation of Bax/caspase 3 signaling	FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION												Introduction Ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) may lead to acute kidney injury via the induction of oxidative stress. On the other hand, Moringa oleifera has been reported to exert antioxidant activities. This study was designed to assess whether or not Moringa oleifera-based feed supplement could prevent I/R-induced renal injury. Materials and methods Renal I/R was induced by occluding the right renal artery for 30 min followed by a 2-h reperfusion. Results Renal I/R led to increased absolute renal weight and renal organo-somatic weight index. Renal I/R also caused distortion of renal histoarchitecture and impaired renal function evidenced by elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. In addition, renal I/R significantly elevated renal levels of hydrogen peroxide, MDA, and advanced oxidation protein products, but suppressed the levels of reduced glutathione, protein thiol, and non-protein thiol, and the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In addition, renal I/R up-regulated myeloperoxidase activity and the renal levels of NO, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. Renal I/R also up-regulated Bax and caspase 3 expression in the kidney. Furthermore, I/R-driven structural and biochemical alterations were markedly inhibited by Moringa oleifera-based feed supplement. Discussion These results suggest that Moringa oleifera-based feed supplement may preserve the gross and histoarchitectural integrity of the kidney as well as renal function via downregulation of Bax/caspase 3 signaling by targeting oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in the kidney of I/R rat.

The synthesis, structural, and compositional characterization of 3D PtxNi1-x/MWCNTs are reported. Cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, kinetic analysis, electrochemical impedance plots, and amperometric responses exhibit that the 3D PtxNi1-x/MWCNTs nanocomposites have more remarkable catalytic performance on the direct oxidation of glucose comparing with the 3D Pt/MWCNTs catalysts and the uniform dispersive morphology PtxNi1-x/MWCNTs catalysts. We further investigate how the Pt/Ni atomic ratios of these alloys play a key role in controlling the electrocatalytic activity and thus improve the glucose detection. The optimal Pt/Ni atomic ratio acquired in present experiment condition is 3/7, which proves linearity up to 15 mM of glucose with a sensitivity of 0.94 mA/mMcm(2) and a detection limit of 0.3 mu M (S/N = 3) at 0.30V. Meanwhile, the interference from dopamine, uric acid, p-acetamidophenol, ascorbic acid, urea, galactose, lactose and fructose is effectively avoided at this negative potential. The as-synthesized sensor is applicable to the glucose sensing in the real human serum with the concentrations agreeing well with that measured by a hospital. Furthermore, 90% of the surface active sites and the initial sensitivity are retained in continuous tests (31 days), proving favorable long-term stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Their structural and electronic properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy utilizing synchrotron radiation. N-doped TiO2 powders were synthesized for the estimation of visible light photocatalytic activities. N-doped TiO2 thin films revealed polycrystalline anatase phases. N was chiefly doped into substitutional sites. The densities of N and defects (oxygen vacancies and reduced Ti species) increased with elevating calcination temperature. Localized states associated with doped N were successfully found from shoulder structures of valence band spectra, which were located at 0.24 eV to 0.34 eV above the valence band maximum in the band gap. Incorporated N enhanced the photocatalytic activity, whereas defects reduced it. The highest photocatalytic activity was obtained by synthesizing N-doped TiO2 powders from a precursor solution with urea and subsequent calcination at 550 degrees C due to high-density N and low-density defects. Consequently, the optimum N/O atomic ratio was shown to be approximately 0.06. It became possible to achieve heavier N doping and better photocatalytic activity under vis light irradiation using urea than any other study only using NH3 gas for nitridation.																			2046-2069						2017	7	4					1887	1898		10.1039/c6ra25238a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra25238a													WOS:000393748000014

Review of Lysine Metabolism with a Focus on Humans	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION					10th Workshop on the Assessment of Adequate and Safe Intake of Dietary Amino Acids (AAAW)	NOV 19-20, 2019	Tokyo, JAPAN	Int Council Amino Acid Sci				Lysine cannot be synthesized by most higher organisms and, therefore, is an indispensable amino acid (IAA) that must be consumed in adequate amounts to maintain protein synthesis. Although lysine is an abundant amino acid in body proteins, lysine is limited in abundance in many important food sources (e.g. grains). Older observations assigned importance to lysine because animals fed a lysine-deficient diet did not lose weight as fast as animals placed upon other IAA-deficient diets, leading to the theory that there may be a special pool of lysine or metabolites that could be converted to lysine. The first step in the lysine catabolic pathway is the formation of saccharopine and then 2-aminoadipic acid, processes that are mitochondrial. The catabolism of 2-aminoadipic acid proceeds via decarboxylation to a series of CoA esters ending in acetyl-CoA. In mammals, the liver appears to be the primary site of lysine catabolism. In humans, the metabolic and oxidative response of lysine to diets either restricted in protein or in lysine is consistent with what has been measured for other IAAs with isotopically labeled tracers. Intestinal microflora are known to metabolize urea to ammonia and scavenge nitrogen (N) for the synthesis of amino acids. Studies feeding N-15-ammonium chloride or N-15-urea to animals and to humans, demonstrate the appearance of N-15-lysine in gut microbial lysine and in host lysine. However, the amount of N-15-lysine transferred to the host is difficult to assess directly using current methods. It is important to understand the role of the gut microflora in human lysine metabolism, especially in conditions where dietary lysine intake may be limited, but better methods need to be devised.

The catalysts required a thermal treatment at temperature higher than 300 degrees C to achieve actual nitrogen doping; this treatment also allowed obtaining crystalline and hydrophobic samples. Moreover, nitrogen doping modified the surface of samples by increasing the anatase to rutile phase ratio and hydrophilicity. The catalysts were characterized by BET specific surface area, XRD, ESEM, TGA, FT-IR, DRS and XPS measurements, with particular attention to the assessment of the N-doping effect. It was found that XPS analysis should be used together with DRS and FT-IR to discriminate whether N had been incorporated in TiO2 lattice or N species had just adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. Moreover, XPS analysis could be also used for determining the crystallinity of TiO2. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was tested for the partial oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol to p-anisaldehyde in water under near-UV, visible, UV-visible and simulated solar light, respectively. Commercial (Degussa P25) and undoped home-prepared TiO2 anatase-rutile catalysts were also used for comparison. The results show that N-doping improves absorption of visible light by the catalysts, but the reaction rate does not increase accordingly. Selectivity was higher in the presence of poorly crystallized catalysts, whereas doping seemed to have a slightly improving effect.					yurdakal, sedat/AAD-3502-2019; Ozcan, Levent/HJP-8912-2023	Ozcan, Levent/0000-0003-4504-4237; Palmisano, Giovanni/0000-0001-9838-6252													1947-2935	1947-2943				NOV	2015	7	11					2306	2319		10.1166/sam.2015.2280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/sam.2015.2280													WOS:000366295900006

We hypothesized that it is caused by different proportions of nitrogen (N) applied as manure and various soil properties. Here, we conducted a microcosm experiment, and measured the N2O emissions from control (no N) and five manure substitution treatments (supplied 100 mg N kg(-1) using the combination of urea with manure) with a range of proportions of N applied as manure (0, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in three different soil types (fluvo-aquic soil, black soil, and latosol) under aerobic condition. The stimulated effect on N2O emissions was more pronounced after manure application in an alkaline soil with high nitrification rate, due to relatively rapid soil DOC depletion and N mineralization of manure. N2O emissions from partial substitution of urea with manure were significantly higher than manure-only addition under high soil pH due to abundant labile C from manure. However, there was no difference between manure substitution treatments under acid soils. Nitrification inhibitor substantially decreased N2O emissions with increasing soil pH, but it was less effective in mitigating N2O emissions with larger proportion of manure. This is likely due to the slow nitrification under low soil pH, and denitrification derived N2O increased with increasing manure application rate. Collectively, our study shows that the application of manure substitution to alkaline soils requires careful consideration, which might have rapid nitrification potential and hence trigger significant N2O emissions. The knowledge gained in this work will help the decision-makers in optimizing a sound N fertilization regime interacted with soil properties for sustainable crop production and N2O mitigation.

These materials were modified with amorphous cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs) on the surface of biochar doped with different nitrogen sources (melamine (Me), 1,10-phenanthroline (Ph), and urea (Ur)). The nanocomposite (Co-N-C(Ur)) with urea as the nitrogen source promoted the generation of mesopores on the surface of carbon materials due to its evaporation during the preparation process thus enhancing the attachment sites of cobalt nanoparticles. The Co-N-C(Ur) had a more significant degradation effect on the primary carcinogen sulfamethazine (SMT) by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The degradation rate of SMT pollutants was 96.6 % within 30 mM. The optimal reaction conditions were as follows: catalyst dosage of 0.4 g L-1, PMS dosage of 0.812 mM, SMT concentration of 10 mg L-1, and pH of 5.67. Additionally, the Co-N-C(Ur) catalysts possess excellent specific surface area due to the evaporation effect of the calcination process of urea itself compared to other nitrogen source doping. Electrochemical tests revealed that the composites prepared with urea as the nitrogen source had higher PMS-induced current density and lowered material impedance values, which effectively promoted the catalytic performance of SMT degradation. Concurrently, the Co-N-C (Ur) + PMS reaction system exhibited excellent catalytic performance against other antibiotic organic pollutants. Subsequently, through the capture experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance technical analyses, it was determined that the singlet O-1(2) played a leading role in the reaction system. Finally, a thorough liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis suggested the possible SMT degradation pathways, thereby providing a new strategy for the subsequent heterogeneous catalysts to degrade persistent organic pollutants.

Two main Ru NPs deposition routes were chosen, i.e. (i) the deposition of surfactant-stabilized preformed metal NPs and (ii) a modified version of the well-known deposition-precipitation technique, employing urea as precipitating agent. Other Ru/TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared (iii) by simply grafting Ru(III) metal ions on TiO2, which were tested either as prepared or (iv) after their thermal reduction under H-2 atmosphere, in order to obtain Ru NPs in full metallic state. The role played also by the relative nominal metal amount on the so obtained photocatalyst powders was investigated in terms of both ammonia conversion and selectivity towards mildly oxidized N-2 or highly oxidized nitrite and nitrate ions. The Ru NPs deposition technique was found to affect the reaction paths especially in terms of products selectivity, with fully reduced Ru NPs on TiO2 being able to promote the environmentally friendly, highly desirable photocatalytic conversion of ammonia into innocuous N-2.

Herein, we present aporous organic polymers containing hydrophilic urea groups (UPOPs) for effective immobilization of palladium nanoparticles (NPs) through a facile urea-forming condensation reaction. The urea groups not only serve as an intriguing linkage of organic framework, but also endows Pd@UPOPs outstanding dispersibility in H2O. The morphology of UPOPs have exerted important influence upon the size and dispersion of palladium NPs as well as their catalytic performances. The palladium NPs are well dispersed on the surface of UPOP-1 with an average size of 2.1 +/- 0.3 nm. In contrast, palladium NPs on UPOP-2 exhibit a dual size distribution with an average diameter of 2.0 +/- 0.4 and 4.2 +/- 0.4 nm. The dehalogenation reactions of chlorobenzene have demonstrated that Pd@UPOP-1 with flower-shaped morphology show higher catalytic activity, recyclability and stability than that of Pd@UPOP-2 with cudgel-shaped morphology. This work offers/supplies a new insight for the development of efficient catalytic systems based on porous organic polymers supported metal NPs in aqueous medium.

Under visible light or natural sunlight, g-C3N4 exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of phenanthrene in contaminated soil at circumneutral pH. Compared with g-C3N4 synthesized by dicyandiamide and melamine, g-C3N4 synthesized by urea has the highest surface areas and degradation activity of phenanthrene in soil. After phenanthrene contaminated soils were treated by g-C3N4, the ecotoxicity of soils was preliminarily evaluated by cultivating plant (lettuce) and raising earthworms (Eisenia fetida). Phenanthrene contaminated soil (200 mg/kg) exhibits obvious toxicity which the growth of lettuce has been inhibited significantly and earthworms can not even survive. Under visible light or natural sunlight, g-C3N4 synthesized by three different precursors can remarkably reduce the toxicity of phenanthrene contaminated soil, which was demonstrated by the lettuce growth indexes, involving leaf length, stem length, root length, and fresh weight, and earthworms' mortality and weight loss. However, compared with the other two g-C3N4 synthesized by dicyandiamide or melamine, g-C3N4 synthesized by urea presents dear relative toxicity on lettuces and earthworms.					wang, mingjun/C-8042-2013; wu, xiangyang/E-4437-2017														1010-6030					FEB 15	2020	389								112241	10.1016/j.jphotochem.2019.112241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotochem.2019.112241													WOS:000508750600044

Herein, the synthesis of FCNO nanoparticles embedded within graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by hydrothermal route assisted with pyrolysis of urea was presented. The g-C3N4 was obtained from an abundantly available precursor urea and the synthesis process played double role. Urea reacted with metal salts to convert them into metallic oxides and yielded g-C3N4. The experimental results revealed the in-situ fabrication of FCNO nanoparticles and formation of g-C3N4. The band gap narrowing made it possible that the samples were able to show a wide range of visible light absorption which made them suitable for photocatalytic activity studies. Thus, the materials were utilized for the visible light-based photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye. Photocatalytic degradation efficiency with -93 % was achieved by the composite FCNO/g-C3N4 (50:50). The present approach for the synthesis of materials was proved to be cost-effective and time saving which enabled their use as recyclable photocatalyst.

Surface modification using crosslinking of diamine and a bis(diarylcarbene): synthesis, characterization, and antibacterial activity via binding hydrogen peroxide	RSC ADVANCES												A bis(diaryldiazomethane)substituted with amino groups was synthesized and used for the surface modification of diverse materials, such as polystyrene, polyethylene, titanium dioxide, and aluminum plate, giving amino-functionalized materials. These were subsequently reacted with phenyl isocyanate to give urea-functionalized materials, so that hydrogen peroxide could be reversibly bound, giving in turn antibacterial materials with high activity. These functionalized materials were characterized using a combination of XPS, IR, and NMR spectroscopy, and clear evidence for the crosslinking on the surface of materials was achieved. The crosslinking reaction in the deposited layer contributed to higher loadings of hydrogen peroxide, and hence the antibacterial activity of urea-functionalized materials significantly increased. This approach gives a new protocol to prepare high loading antiseptic/antibacterial materials and surfaces.

However, when they are used in combination, the Fenton reaction occurs, leading to the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Given that kidney is vulnerable to many toxicants including free radicals, we speculated that the in vivo administration of AA plus Cu2+ may cause oxidative kidney injury. The purpose of this study was to address this possibility. Mice were administered with AA and Cu2+, alone or in combination, via oral gavage once a day for various periods. Changes in the systemic oxidative status, as well renal structure and functions, were examined. The administration of AA plus Cu2+ elevated protein oxidation in serum, intestine, bladder, and kidney, as evidenced by the increased sulfenic acid formation and decreased level of free sulfhydryl groups (-SH). The systemic oxidative stress induced by AA plus Cu2+ was associated with a significant loss of renal function and structure, as indicated by the increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and urinary proteins, as well as glomerular and tubular cell injury. These effects of AA and Cu2+ were only observed when used in combination, and could be entirely prevented by thiol antioxidant NAC. Further analysis using cultured renal tubular epithelial cells revealed that AA plus Cu2+ caused cellular protein oxidation and cell death, which could be abolished by NAC and catalase. Moreover, coincubation of AA and Cu2+ led to H2O2 production. Collectively, our study revealed that a combined administration of AA and Cu2+ resulted in systemic oxidative stress and renal cell injury. As health-promoting supplements, AA and Cu2+ should not be used together.

Application of a FIGAERO ToF CIMS for on-line characterization of real-world fresh and aged particle emissions from buses	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												On-line chemical characterization of real-world particle emissions from 13 transit buses was performed using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) equipped with a filter inlet for gases and aerosols (FIGAERO). In addition to the fresh emissions the emissions were artificially aged using a potential aerosol mass reactor (Go:PAM). The buses studied were running on different fuel types (diesel, compressed natural gas, and rapeseed methyl ester) and exhaust after-treatment systems (selective catalytic reduction (SCR), exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and a three-way catalyst). When evaluating emissions from passing exhaust plumes using the FIGAERO ToF-CIMS, two technical features were highlighted from this work, the use of high mass calibrants and the factor enhancement method to be able to filter important compounds from mass spectra including hundreds of species. Here, acetate was used as the reagent ion to enable detection of highly oxygenated species in the exhaust particle emissions with potential high toxicity and/or secondary organic aerosol formation (SOA) potential. The acetate ionization scheme accounted for 4% to 46% of the total emitted particulate mass through identification of 61 species in the spectra. For aged emission the various fuel types provided overlapping species that could explain up to 19% of the aged emissions. This is hypothesized to come from the oxidation of engine lubrication oil, thus a common source for various fuels which was further supported by laboratory measurements. Specific markers from the SCR technology, such as urea oxidation products and further byproducts from hydrolysis were identified and attributed to reactions of isocyanic acid.

The surface elemental composition of the catalyst was analyzed through XPS, which showed a high content of a total N species (7.12 at.%), indicative of the effective N-doping, present in the form of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N groups. Moreover, Au nanoparticles deposited on ZnO nanocrystals surface, forming Au/ZnO hybrid nanocatalysts, undergo a super-hydrophobic to super-hydrophilic conversion. Herein, we present Au/ZnO hybrid nanocatalysts impregnated in N-doped graphene sheets through sonication technique of the Au/ZnO/N-doped graphene hybrid nanostructures. The as-prepared Au/ZnO/N-doped graphene hybrid nanostructure modified glassy carbon electrode (Au/ZnO/N-doped graphene/GCE) was first employed for the simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and acetaminophen (AC). The oxidation over-potentials of AA, DA and AC decreased dramatically, and their oxidation peak currents increased significantly at Au/ZnO/N-doped graphene/GCE compared to those obtained at the N-doped graphene/GCE and bare CCE. The peak separations between AA and DA, DA and AC, and AC and AA are large up to 195, 198 and 393 my, respectively. The calibration curves for AA, DA and AC were obtained in the range of 30.00-13.00 x 10(3), 2.00-0.18 x 10(3) and 5.00-3.10 x 10(3) mu M, respectively. The detection limits (S/N = 3) were 5.00, 0.40 and 0.80 mu M for AA, DA and AC, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The g-C3N4 samples were systematically characterized and their photocatalytic performances were evaluated by photocatalytic degrading rhodamine B (RhB). g-C3N4 prepared from two precursors exhibited better degrading performance than g-C3N4 synthesized from single precursor, and the degradation rate constant of g-C3N4 prepared from urea and thiourea with mole ratio of 3:1(CN-UT-3) was the largest one, which was about 21.6 times that of g-C3N4 prepared from melamine alone. The enhanced specific surface area as well as the accelerated separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers were the main reasons for the improvement of photocatalytic performance. In addition, UV-vis and Mott-Schottky plots showed that an energy band structure like type II heterojunction were constructed in as-synthesized g-C3N4 samples from dual precursors, whose internal electric field provided the power for the migration of photo-generated carriers. The scavenger experiments revealed that h(+) and center dot O-2(-) were the active groups taking part in the photocatalytic reaction. Moreover, CN-UT-3 exhibited excellent recyclability and stability during the cycle experiments. This work provides a facile way to synthesize g-C3N4 with high photocatalytic performance, and reveals the effects of the precursor types and their mole ratios on the structure and photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized g-C3N4 photocatalyst.

We performed in vivo and in vitro experiments to examine the effects of PB on glutamine (GLN), branched-chain amino acid (BCAA; valine, leucine and isoleucine) and protein metabolism in rats. In the first study, animals were sacrificed one hour after three injections of PB (300mg/kg b.w.) or saline. In the second study, soleus (SOL, slow twitch) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL, fast twitch) muscles were incubated in a medium with or without PB (5 mM). L-[1-C-14] leucine was used to estimate protein synthesis and leucine oxidation, and 3-methylhistidine release was used to evaluate myofibrillar protein breakdown. PB treatment decreased GLN, BCAA and branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) in blood plasma, decreased BCAA and increased GLN concentrations in muscles, and increased GLN synthetase activities in muscles. Addition of PB to incubation medium increased leucine oxidation (55% in EDL, 29% in SOL), decreased BCKA and increased GLN in medium of both muscles, increased GLN in muscles, decreased protein synthesis in SOL and increased proteolysis in EDL. It is concluded that PB decreases BCAA, BCKA and GLN in blood plasma, activates BCAA catabolism and GLN synthesis in muscle and exerts adverse effects on protein metabolism. The results indicate that BCAA and GLN supplementation is needed when PB is used therapeutically and that PB may be a useful prospective agent which could be effective in management of maple syrup urine disease.																			0959-9673	1365-2613				JUN	2017	98	3					127	133		10.1111/iep.12231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/iep.12231								28621016					WOS:000408620000050

PPARα via HNF4α regulates the expression of genes encoding hepatic amino acid catabolizing enzymes to maintain metabolic homeostasis	GENES AND NUTRITION												The liver is the main organ involved in the metabolism of amino acids (AA), which are oxidized by amino acid catabolizing enzymes (AACE). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha) stimulates fatty acid beta-oxidation, and there is evidence that it can modulate hepatic AA oxidation during the transition of energy fuels. To understand the role and mechanism of PPAR alpha's regulation of AA catabolism, the metabolic and molecular adaptations of Ppara-null mice were studied. The role of PPAR alpha on AA metabolism was examined by in vitro and in vivo studies. In wild-type and Ppara-null mice, fed increasing concentrations of the dietary protein/carbohydrate ratio, we measured metabolic parameters, and livers were analyzed by microarray analysis, histology and Western blot. Functional enrichment analysis, EMSA and gene reporter assays were performed. Ppara-null mice presented increased expression of AACE in liver affecting AA, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Ppara-null mice had increased glucagon/ insulin ratio (7.2-fold), higher serum urea (73.1 %), lower body protein content (19.7 %) and decreased several serum AA in response to a high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet. A functional network of differentially expressed genes, suggested that changes in the expression of AACE were regulated by an interrelationship between PPAR alpha and HNF4 alpha. Our data indicated that the expression of AACE is down-regulated through PPAR alpha by attenuating HNF4 alpha transcriptional activity as observed in the serine dehydratase gene promoter. PPAR alpha via HNF4 alpha maintains body protein metabolic homeostasis by down-regulating genes involved in amino acid catabolism for preserving body nitrogen.

Emissions and Secondary Formation of Air Pollutants from Modern Heavy-Duty Trucks in Real-World Traffic-Chemical Characteristics Using On-Line Mass Spectrometry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Complying with stricter emissions standards, a new generation of heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) has gradually increased its market share and now accounts for a large percentage of on-road mileage. The potential to improve air quality depends on an actual reduction in both emissions and subsequent formation of secondary pollutants. In this study, the emissions in real-world traffic from Euro VI-compliant HDTs were compared to those from older classes, represented by Euro V, using high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Gas-phase primary emissions of several hundred species were observed for 70 HDTs. Furthermore, the particle phase and secondary pollutant formation (gas and particle phase) were evaluated for a number of HDTs. The reduction in primary emission factors (EFs) was evident (similar to 90%) and in line with a reduction of 28-97% for the typical regulated pollutants. Secondary production of most gas- and particle-phase compounds, for example, nitric acid, organic acids, and carbonyls, after photochemical aging in an oxidation flow reactor exceeded the primary emissions (EFAged/EFFresh ratio >= 2). Byproducts from urea-selective catalytic reduction systems had both primary and secondary sources.

Nitrous oxide production by ammonia oxidizers: Physiological diversity, niche differentiation and potential mitigation strategies	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Oxidation of ammonia to nitrite by bacteria and archaea is responsible for global emissions of nitrous oxide directly and indirectly through provision of nitrite and, after further oxidation, nitrate to denitrifiers. Their contributions to increasing N2O emissions are greatest in terrestrial environments, due to the dramatic and continuing increases in use of ammonia-based fertilizers, which have been driven by requirement for increased food production, but which also provide a source of energy for ammonia oxidizers (AO), leading to an imbalance in the terrestrial nitrogen cycle. Direct N2O production by AO results from several metabolic processes, sometimes combined with abiotic reactions. Physiological characteristics, including mechanisms for N2O production, vary within and between ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) and comammox bacteria and N2O yield of AOB is higher than in the other two groups. There is also strong evidence for niche differentiation between AOA and AOB with respect to environmental conditions in natural and engineered environments. In particular, AOA are favored by low soil pH and AOA and AOB are, respectively, favored by low rates of ammonium supply, equivalent to application of slow-release fertilizer, or high rates of supply, equivalent to addition of high concentrations of inorganic ammonium or urea. These differences between AOA and AOB provide the potential for better fertilization strategies that could both increase fertilizer use efficiency and reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils. This article reviews research on the biochemistry, physiology and ecology of AO and discusses the consequences for AO communities subjected to different agricultural practices and the ways in which this knowledge, coupled with improved methods for characterizing communities, might lead to improved fertilizer use efficiency and mitigation of N2O emissions.

Thiosulfate (STS) is a common residual product found in wastewater and removal of STS remains a matter of great environmental concern. In this work, however, STS is activated by g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation, resulting in a fast degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and other pollutants. The performance of g-C3N4 prepared from urea was much higher than that from melamine, due to the higher surface area and more negative conduction band potential of the former catalyst. In addition, comparison with other oxidants and reductants such as peroxymonosulfate, peroxydisulfate, hydrogen peroxide and sulfite, the use of STS in g-C3N4/Vis system showed the highest efficiency for RhB degradation. During ten successive cycles, the excellent reusability of the catalyst was also obtained. The effect of different concentrations of STS and g-C3N4, and initial solution pH on the performance of the system were also studied. The mechanism study suggests that STS is first oxidized to S2O3 center dot- radicals by photohole, which will be transformed to other oxysulfur radicals such as SO3 center dot- and finally to SO42- ions. At the same time, the rate of O-2 reduction by photoelectrons to O2(center dot)(-) radicals as well as RhB degradation increases. The finding of this study provides a promising advanced oxidation process for organic pollutants degradation via STS activation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and trimetazidine (TMZ) can prevent the occurrence of CIN after elective cardiac catheterization in patients with coronary artery disease complicated with renal dysfunction. Methods: Consecutive coronary artery disease patients with renal insufficiency scheduled for coronary angiography were enrolled in randomized, paralleled, double-blind, controlled trial. The development of CIN was occurrence at the 48 or 72 h after the procedure. The changes of serum creatinine (SCr), eGFR, and Cys-C within 72 h after the procedure were measured and compared. In vivo contrast medium (CM)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) animal model was established, and CoQ10 plus TMZ was orally administrated to evaluate its renal protective effect. Results: 150 patients with renal insufficiency were enrolled finally. CIN occurred in 21 (14.00%) of the 150 patients. 72 h after the procedure, the incidence of CIN was significantly lower in CoQ10 plus TMZ group compared with control group (6.67 vs. 21.3%, p = 0.01). No cardiac death occurred in this study. No side effects were observed after administration of CoQ10 and TMZ. In vivo test demonstrated that CoQ10 and TMZ could significantly reduce the concentration of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and SCR induced by CM i.v. injection, as well as tubular pathological injuries. Meanwhile, CoQ10 and TMZ could significantly reduce the oxidation stress in kidneys from CM-AKI animals. Conclusion: CoQ10 plus TMZ could decrease the incidence of CIN in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing elective cardiac catheterization, and their effect may be due to its strong anti-oxidation effect.

ZnONFs have been synthesized by a hydrothermal process and characterized with several techniques such as ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies, X-ray diffraction (XRD) study, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and electrochemical analyzer to confirm the formation of nanoflowers and fabrication of electrode and bio-electrodes for uric acid detection. Zinc Oxide nanoflowers have been deposited onto indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrate through electrophoretic deposition technique, and the biosensor has been fabricated by immobilizing urate oxidase (UOx) enzyme onto ZnONFs/ITO electrode surfaces. Further, electrochemical studies have been performed with immobilized UOx/ZnONFs/ITO bio-electrode as a function of uric acid concentrations. It has been found that the fabricated uric acid biosensor shows a high sensitivity (10.38 mu A/mM/cm(2)) and a limit of detection of 0.13 mM in the range of 0.005 to 1.0 mM. This study demonstrates the potential use of ZnONFs for the construction of sensitive biosensors for uric acid detection.

J	Dinesh, GK; Chakma, S				Dinesh, G. Kumaravel; Chakma, Sankar			Mechanistic investigation in degradation mechanism of 5-Fluorouracil using graphitic carbon nitride	ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY												The present study reports the synthesis of metal-free polymeric catalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), through sonochemical method followed by thermal treatment. The synthesized g-C3N4 was characterized using XRD, DRS, FESEM, TGA, EDX, etc. and the characterization results revealed that it possesses medium band-gap energy, high thermal and chemical stability. The photo-activity of the catalyst was also evaluated using degradation of 5-Fluorouracil under different experimental conditions. The results revealed that the addition of H2O2 during sonolysis process did not show any significant synergy. This is attributed to the low vapor pressure of H2O2 that does not allow it to diffuse into the cavitation bubble to produce (OH)-O-center dot radicals through sonolysis process. Using sono-hybrid process, more than 90% degradation was seen within 5 min of treatment with a rate constant of 3.95 x 10(-2) s(-1). In alkaline medium, 5-Fluorouracil degradation occurred through defluorination and subsequently substitution of -OH group to the aromatic ring leading to formation of intermediates such as 2-fluoro-3-oxopropanoic acid and urea. While sono-hybrid advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) helped towards complete mineralization through formation of smaller molecular compounds such as maleic acids, lactic acids, propanol, etc. On the other hand, the maximum synergy effect of similar to 2.4 was seen for sonocatalysis process followed by hybrid-AOPs of (US + g-C3N4 + H2O2 + UVC) with a synergy factor of similar to 2.2. Also, the synthesized catalyst exhibited the same catalytic activity even after 5 runs of sono-photocatalysis process for degradation of 5-Fluorouracil.					dinesh, kumaravel/N-7271-2018; Chakma, Sankar/C-7559-2015	dinesh, kumaravel/0000-0002-8808-7360; Chakma, Sankar/0000-0002-8227-0455													1350-4177	1873-2828				JAN	2019	50						311	321		10.1016/j.ultsonch.2018.09.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2018.09.032								30270007					WOS:000449241100032

Effect of the Graphitic Carbon Nitride Synthesis Atmosphere on its Activity in the Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY												Materials based on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are intensely studied as promising photocatalysts of different reactions, hydrogen peroxide formation including. Effect of synthesis parameters of g-C3N4 obtained by thermolysis of melamine, urea, and thiourea on its composition and photocatalytic activity has been studied. The photocatalytic activity of obtained materials has been studied in the reaction of oxidative decomposition of organic dye and in oxygen reduction to form hydrogen peroxide. It has been shown that, in spite of incomplete polycondensation after thermolysis, the obtained samples display high values of photocatalytic activity. The work has shown that the photocatalytic activity of samples obtained at 550 degrees C is by factor 2-4 higher than that for samples obtained at 500 and 600 degrees C. It has been shown that the preparation of g-C3N4 from thiourea in air leads to photocatalyst with maximal activity, whereas melamine and urea produce the best catalyst under nitrogen atmosphere.

Electrolytic and electro-irradiated technologies for the removal of chloramphenicol in synthetic urine with diamond anodes	WATER RESEARCH												Hospital effluents are a major source for the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, in the environment. In this work, the treatment of synthetic urine polluted with chloramphenicol is studied by using three different conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation technologies: electrolysis (single electrolysis), photo electrolysis and high-frequency ultrasound sonoelectrolysis. These technologies were evaluated at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2). Results shows that not only chloramphenicol but also other organics contained in urine are completely mineralized by electrolysis. Ammonium is the main inorganic nitrogen species formed and it can react with the electrogenerated hypochlorite, favouring the formation of chloramines. These species prevent the potential formation of perchlorate from chlorides contained in urine at low current densities (10 mA cm(-2)) and delay its occurrence at high current densities (100 mA cm(-2)). On the other hand, irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light or high-frequency ultrasound (US) produce changes in the performance of the electrolytic treatment, but these changes are not as important as in other cases of study shown in the literature. Nonetheless, the effect of electroirradiated technologies seems to be higher and depends on the type of pollutant when working at low current densities (10 mA cm(-2)). It is positive in the case of the degradation of the antibiotic and the uric acid and negative in the case of urea where there is a clear antagonistic effect. Production of oxidants increases with the current density although in lower ratio than expected. These results are of great importance because clearly point out that electrolytic technologies can be applied to minimize the diffuse pollution associated to pharmaceuticals before discharge into municipal sewers.

Solution Combustion Synthesised Cu-CeO2 Catalysts For CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol- the Effect of the Fuel	CHEMISTRYSELECT												The tunability of structural properties such as oxygen vacancies, Cu surface composition, reducibility of CuO, and basicity by solution combustion synthesised (SCS) Cu-CeO2 catalysts was investigated. Five different fuels, viz. urea (U), tartaric acid (TA), citric acid (CA), ethylene glycol (EG) and oxalyl dihydrazide (ODH), were employed in the synthesis of the catalysts. Raman spectroscopy, O-2-TPD and XPS revealed that the urea synthesised catalyst had the highest concentration of oxygen vacancies, the amount of which was controlled by the fuel used. The oxygen vacancies were the catalytic sites for CO2 adsorption and promoted electron donation to Cu at the Cu-CeO2 junction, thus improving H-2 adsorption and spillover, which was beneficial for methanol synthesis. The better catalytic performance of the urea synthesised Cu-CeO2 catalyst with a methanol STY of 163 g(CH3OH) kg(cat)(-1) h(-1) compared to the other solution combustion synthesis fuels, was attributable to higher oxygen vacancies, more facile Cu reduction, larger Cu surface area and higher Cu surface composition. Based on the absence of the Cu+ species capable of directing the methanol synthesis reaction through the CO intermediate based on XPS data, we surmised that the formate route was the preferred pathway for the studied Cu-CeO2 catalysts.

Remarkably improved dispersion of Pd nanoparticles was observed when nitrogen was introduced into the graphene structure.

We found that the g-C3N4 attained by urea pyrolysis exhibited prominent Hg-0 capture ability with Hg-0 removal efficiency of similar to 84% which is much higher than that of the g-C3N4 derived from dicyandiamide and melamine pyrolysis, probably attributed to its bigger BET surface area and pore volume.

Are nitrification inhibitors effective in reducing N2O from farm-scale emission hotspots?	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS												Livestock congregation areas are nitrous oxide (N2O) hot-spots and could be key areas to focus mitigation action. We tested whether combined cattle urine and fertiliser N2O-N emission factors (EFs) would be higher from a farm gateway area compared to a standard pasture under sub-tropical conditions, and whether the nitrification inhibitor, dimethyl pyrazole phosphate (DMPP), would lower N2O EFs from the gateway area. Treatments (n = 3) included: (i) fertiliser applied to a standard pasture (50 kg urea-N ha(-1)), (ii) fertiliser (50 kg urea-N ha(-1)) + urine (350 kg N ha(-1)) applied to a standard pasture, (iii) fertiliser (50 kg urea-N ha(-1)) + urine (350 kg N ha(-1)) applied to the gateway area, and (iv) fertiliser (50 kg urea-N ha(-1)) + urine (350 kg N ha(-1)) + DMPP (1.5 kg ha(-1)) applied to the gateway area. Emissions were monitored via an automated static chamber-based system and N-15-labelled urine treatments (n = 4) used to assess N2O + N-2 emissions, N2O:N-2 and N-15 recovery from the pasture. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed for EFs between the fertiliser + urine treatment for the standard pasture (1.10 +/- 0.17%) or the gateway area (1.46 +/- 0.40%). DMPP did not lower the N2O-N EF from the gateway area (1.50 +/- 0.22%), where wet and warm conditions may have accelerated DMPP degradation. In the N-15-labelled urine treatments, significantly (p < 0.05) greater N2O + N-2 emissions occurred in the gateway compared to the standard pasture, but disaggregating EFs between the contrasting areas was not warranted.

Introducing urea into zeolite synthesis is a simple and convenient method to modify these properties of titanosilicate zeolite. Uncalcined pore-blocked titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1, i.e., TS-1-B) with the lower urea dosage possesses more defective structure and unsaturated coordinated Ti sites verified by Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, which results in a high initial activity and hydrogen efficiency; while the high surface acidity generated by these Ti species leads to a continuous decrease in the activity and the propylene oxide (PO) selectivity during the reaction. As the amount of urea gradually increases, the TS-1-B samples present the reduced surface defects and defective and unsaturated Ti species. Specially, TS-1-B-0.30U presents the weaker PO adsorption on PO-diffusion reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS), and thus results in the high stable PO formation rate and selectivity over its Au catalyst. Furthermore, a flat-plate-like shape with a shorter thickness of 100 nm along the b-axis direction is observed on the urea-modified TS-1. Compared with the conventional ellipsoidal TS-1 with crystal sizes of 200 and 500 nm, the flat-plate-like TS-1-0.30U displays the less surface defects, unsaturated Ti species, and the weaker Lewis acid, which is favorable for the desorption and intracrystalline diffusion of PO, thus reduces the occurrence of side reactions for the improved selectivity and stability. This work may provide a reference for developing titanium-containing materials with high activity and stability over HOPO reaction.

J	Liao, G; Yao, W				Liao, Gang; Yao, Wu			Facile synthesis of porous isotype heterojunction g-C3N4 for enhanced photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light	DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS												To improve the comprehensive photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4, a facile co-polycondensation method was applied to synthesize porous isotype heterojunction g-C3N4 using urea and melamine as precursors. The microstructure of as-prepared samples was revealed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption desorption test, Fourier-transform infrared spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry. The product yield and thermal stability of the isotype g-C3N4 was improved. Photocatalytic performance of all samples was evaluated by photodegradation of Rhodamine B under visible light. The results show that U3M1 sample (with urea-to-melamine ratio of 3:1) exhibits the highest photocatalytic efficiency, and the corresponding apparent rate constant is around 1.4 and 6.7 folds than that of U1M0 (with pure urea) and U0M1 (with pure melamine), respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the hierarchically porous isotype heterojunction structure, which not only improves the charge separation efficiency, but also reduces the electron-hole recombination. In addition, the porous isotype heterojunction g-C3N4 displays excellent reusability after suffering 4 cyclic tests. This work provides a feasible method for preparing g-C3N4 with high photocatalytic efficiency, and promotes the application of g-C3N4 in the purification of dye wastewater.																			0925-9635	1879-0062				OCT	2022	128								109227	10.1016/j.diamond.2022.109227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diamond.2022.109227		JUL 2022											WOS:000830912200006

The volatile fatty acid (VFA) was obtained from food industry wastewater using a high-yield WA extraction system. The experimentation was conducted in two stages: continuous production of VFA and batch production of PHB. During the VFA production, the optimal VFA yield was determined at different hydraulic retention times (HRT) and high chemical oxidation demand (COD). To find the highest PHB production yield, the level of glycerin, ammonia nitrogen, and substrate inoculation in the batch PHB production stage was recorded. At 35 degrees C and 150 rpm, the wastewater substrate was mixed with urea to achieve an ammonia nitrogen concentration of 2 g/L. The mixed microorganisms were employed to produce PHB. Results revealed that the volatile solids had a PHB yield of 40% (g PHB/g VSS), while the volatile solids (VSS) had 6,900 mg/L. The effluent from the acidification tank can effectively generate PHB to produce VFAs from waste sewage and food industry wastewater. Using various kinds of wastewaters to generate value-added products is an excellent approach to bioenergy generation.

Excellent biocompatibility of g-C3N4 makes its suitable for the sufficient immobilization of glucose oxidase with improved catalytic behavior. The electrochemical oxidation behavior of glucose was chosen as the model to study the sensing performance of GOx/g-C3N4 nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode in neutral condition. Several impact factors, such as the mixing ratio of g-C3N4 and GOx, the modified amount of GOx/g-C3N4 suspension, the applied potential, and the pH values, were investigated. Under the optimal condition, glucose can be linearly detected in the range of 50 mu M to 2 mM with the sensitivity of 21.7 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). The detection limit was evaluated as 5 mu M with the signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The modified electrode exhibited good reproducibility and long-term stability, which is applicable for the detection of glucose in real samples.					w, s/IUO-2655-2023														0927-7757	1873-4359				NOV 20	2019	581								123808	10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.123808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.123808													WOS:000487764400025

The characterization showed that the as prepared hierarchical dandelion-like NiCo2O4 microspheres are composed of closely connected outstretched nanowires with the average diameter about 50 nm and length about 1-1.5 mu m with the substructured nanowires made up of nanoparticles with the diameters less than 10 nm. The dandelion-like NiCo2O4 hierarchical microspheres exhibited superior electrochemical activity towards oxidation of glucose, which is much higher than that of pure NiO microspheres. The amperometric responses are linear with glucose in the concentration range of 10-10480 mu M a sensitivity of 430.86 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1). Moreover, the interference from the commonly interfering species such as L-valine, urea, L-proline, NaCl and L-lysine can be effectively avoided. The good electrochemical performance of materials may be due to its complex chemical compositions, hierarchical structure and the synergetic effect of both individual components. The high sensitivity, wide glucose detection range and good selectivity indicated that the newly developed sensor based on the dandelion-like NiCo2O4 hierarchical microspheres is a promising sensor for practical application.

Photodegradation of cytostatic drugs by g-C3N4: Synthesis, properties and performance fitted by selecting the appropriate precursor	CATALYSIS TODAY												Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthetized by a one-step thermal method from different N-rich precursors, namely melamine, dicyandiamide, urea, thiourea and cyanamide. The structure, optical and physicochemical properties of g-C3N4 materials were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy, among others. Both melamine and dicyandiamide provided a less porous structure composed by large flake sheets, whereas urea and thiourea favoured g-C(3)N(4 )composed by small flat sheets and wrinkles with a larger porosity. The establishment of more condensed g-C3N4 networks with a reduced band gap was also evidenced for melamine and dicyandiamide precursors, while urea favoured less condensed melem or melon structures. The photoactivity of the different g-C3N4 was assessed for the removal of an aqueous solution containing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cyclophosphamide (CP) or a mixture of both cytostatic drugs, under near UV-Vis and solar-LED irradiations. The best performing photocatalysts under near UV-Vis irradiation, were those prepared from melamine (k(app) = 14.6 x 10(-2) min(-1) for 5-FU) and thiourea (k(app) = 2.5 x 10(-2) min(-1) for CP), while urea was the most active under solar-LED irradiation (k(app) = 0.183 x 10(-2) min(-1) for 5-FU). In addition, CP was more resistant to be degraded than 5-FU, and a competitive effect for the generated hydroxyl radicals was evidenced when both pollutant molecules were in the same solution. The photoactivity of g-C3N4 materials was justified by the combination of various effects: (i) surface area, (ii) well-connected and condensed g-C3N4 structures and (iii) high surface C/N ratios with nitrogen vacancies.

Aniline-nonamer segmented polyurea: A facile electrocatalyst for detection of ascorbic acid	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE												An unprecedented A-B-A type block copolymer electroactive polyurea (EPU) is designed and synthesized with tetraaniline dimer and 1,4-phenylenediamine via an oxidative coupling, where aniline-nonamer and hexamethylene di-urea constitute two segments. The EPU was characterized by spectral techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and UV-vis spectra. The structural characterization of the prepared EPU was obtained by powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. EPU reorganizes into core-shell microcapsules in presence of aqueous acetic acid/n-octane interface. These microcapsules exhibited a wide range of pH responses in their absorption spectrum (UV-vis). The EPU is modified as carbon paste electrode which exhibits a remarkable electrocatalytic oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA, Vitamin C) in 0.2 M and pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution. The carbon paste electrode is useful in sensing as low as 50 mu M of ascorbic acid. This can open up new opportunities for fast, simple detection of AA providing a promising platform for sensor/biosensor designs for AA detection. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Prebiotic Chemistry of Phosphite: Mild Thermal Routes to Form Condensed-P Energy Currency Molecules Leading Up to the Formation of Organophosphorus Compounds	LIFE-BASEL												The in-fall of meteorites and interstellar dust particles during the Hadean-Archean heavy bombardment may have provided the early Earth with various reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds and minerals, including phosphite (HPO32-)([Pi(III)]). The ion phosphite ([Pi(III)])has been postulated to be ubiquitous on the early Earth and consequently could have played a role in the emergence of organophosphorus compounds and other prebiotically relevant P species such as condensed P compounds, e.g., pyrophosphite ([PPi(III)]) and isohypophosphate ([PPi(III-V)]). In the present study, we show that phosphite ([Pi(III)]) oxidizes under mild heating conditions (e.g., wet-dry cycles and a prebiotic scenario mimicking a mildly hot-evaporating/drying pool on the early Earth at 78-83 degrees C) in the presence of urea and other additives, resulting in changes to orthophosphate ([Pi(V)]) alongside the formation of reactive condensed P compounds (e.g., pyrophosphite ([PPi(III)]) and isohypophosphate ([PPi(III-V)])) through a one-pot mechanism. Additionally, we also show that phosphite ([Pi(III)]) and the condensed P compounds readily react with organics (nucleosides and organic alcohol) to form organophosphorus compounds.

CNCs can't produce electrical or optical signals directly. Different from published sensing methods, a novel and simple electrochemical sensor for sensitive and selective detection of ascorbic acid (AA) was constructed based on three-dimensional nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbons (NHPC) by carbonizing CNCs and urea. Compared with bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the presence of porous carbons effectively increases the electron transport between analytes and the electrode, and significantly reduces the overpotential of AA oxidation. Under the optimum conditions, the electrode comprised of NHPC exhibits an extremely wide linear range from 8 & times; 10-5 to 1 & times; 10-2 M (R2 = 0.9996) and 1 & times; 10-6 to 5 & times; 10-5 M (R2 = 0.9867) to recognize the AA molecules, with a low detection limit of 2.45 & times; 10-7 M (S/N = 3) at a sensitivity of 0.1138 mu A mu M- 1 cm-2. In particular, the sensing system for AA detection was further verified by the successful monitoring of AA in some spiked real samples.

It enables the definition of the mechanism of sensing, which is essential for the application of the suited design strategy of the device. In the present work, we studied the ways in which post-synthesis thermal treatments influence the optical and electrochemical properties of Nitrogen-doped CDs (N-CDs). Blue-emitting, N-CDs for application in biosensors were synthesized through the hydrothermal route, starting from citric acid and urea as bio-synthesizable and low-cost precursors. The CDs samples were thermally post-treated and then characterized through a combination of spectroscopic, structural, and electrochemical techniques. We observed that the post-synthesis thermal treatments show an oxidative effect on CDs graphitic N-atoms. They cause their partially oxidation with the formation of mixed valence state systems, [CDs](0+), which could be further oxidized into the graphitic N-oxide forms. We also observed that thermal treatments cause the decomposition of the CDs external ammonium ions into ammonia and protons, which protonate their pyridinic N-atoms. Photoluminescence (PL) emission is quenched.

The N-GQDs was one-step synthesized in an easy and green way using citric acid as the carbon source and urea as nitrogen source. The sensor was based on the different quenching effects of Fe(III) and Fe(II) on the fluorescence intensity of N-GQDs. The fluorescence of N-GQDs was quenched by Fe(III) via the strong selective coordination interaction between them. In the presence of AA, Fe(III) can be transformed to Fe(II) ascribed to the oxidation-reduction reaction, leading to the recovery of fluorescence. On the basis of this principle, a fluorescence sensor for AA detection was constructed. Under optimal conditions, the method showed a response to AA within a concentration range of 1.0-90 mu mol L-1 with a good linear relationship and the detection limit for AA was 18 nmol L-1.

A thermal pyrolysis of citric acid and urea is adopted to synthesize crystalline GNDs under IR irradiation. The as-prepared GNDs are uniformly coated over three types of substrates including Cu foil, cotton cloth and filter paper. The GND thin films emit tunable fluorescence upon thermal treatment of GNDs at 400 degrees C in helium atmosphere. The thermally treated GND-based thin film exhibits excellent thermal as well as electrical conductivity compared to bare GNDs and reduced graphene oxide sheets. The enhanced conductivity is due to the reduced oxidation level induced by the thermal treatment on GNDs samples which subsequently decreases the photon scattering. With increasing weight loading, GNDs can serve not only as connective point but also as stuff, offering a well-developed conductive path for the heat dissipation. Accordingly, the design of GND thin film is promising for enhanced thermal management for electronic and photonic applications since it enables engineering the fluorescence emission with substantially increased thermal and electrical conductivities.

The photocatalytic activity of N-WO3 is evaluated for the degradation of amaranth (AM) dye under visible and UVA light along with the role of reactive species, which has not yet been studied for N-WO3 photocatalysts. Doping of N into substitutional and interstitial sites of WO3 is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy. At a pH of 7, 1 g l(-1) of N-WO3 can completely degrade 10 mg l(-1) of AM within 1 h under visible and UVA light. For the degradation of AM by N-WO3 under visible and UVA light, h(+) is found to be the main reactive species, while (OH)-O-center dot contributes to a lesser extent. On the contrary, O-1(2), O-center dot(2)- and e(-) show negligible roles. The crucial role of h(+) indicates effective suppression of electron-hole recombination after N doping. Dye sensitization and oxidation by reactive species are found to be the major pathway for the degradation of AM under visible and UVA light, respectively.

Methodology: The study evaluated 35 patients transplanted at the time of hospital discharge and 3 months after regarding: body composition, REE (by indirect calorimetry), and injury factor (IF); serum urea, creatinine, glucose, albumin, total protein, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), vitamin C. Results: Three months after discharge, there was an improvement in renal function, nutritional status, and oxidative stress, with a standardization in the REE/kg. There was an increase in body weight, mainly in fat mass. The correlations showed that a greater cold ischemia time resulted in a deeper decline in vitamin C; a longer hospital length stay resulted in a greater reduction in AOPP; the higher preoperative body weight showed greater increases in body fat and glucose after transplantation. For decreases in REE and IF, there were increases in total protein. Finally, at hospital discharge there was a greater gain in weight, lower albumin, and total protein among individuals who had rejection episodes. Discussion: The KT improves many of metabolic abnormalities, with the improvement of nutritional status, oxidative stress, and normalization of REE.

The material also showed good selectivity towards hydrazine detection in the presence of various interferences, such as uric acid, ascorbic acid, urea, dopamine, Na+, SO42-, K+, and Cl-. The excellent sensing performance of the FeCo Oxide/CSs was assumed to the unique hierarchical urchin structure with the high density and uniformity of nano sized FeCo Oxide nanoneedles, which produced massive electroactive sites and enhanced charge transfer ability. The achieved results implied that the FeCo Oxide/CSs may be a great candidate for sensitive hydrazine detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pillai, A; Albersheim, S; Elango, R				Pillai, Anish; Albersheim, Susan; Elango, Rajavel			High-dose parenteral amino acid intake in very low birthweight infants: what is the current evidence?	CURRENT OPINION IN CLINICAL NUTRITION AND METABOLIC CARE												Purpose of review There is uncertainty regarding optimal dosing for parenteral amino acids in preterm infants and wide variability exists in clinical practice. There is new data from clinical trials trying to address these concerns. We review the recent evidence on parenteral high-dose amino acid intake in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates with a focus on relevant clinical outcomes. Recent findings Preterm infants often receive less protein than intended in the first week of life. Parenteral amino acid administration in doses that exceed requirements, however, leads to increased oxidation and higher blood urea concentrations. Amino acid doses greater than 3.5 g/kg/day have not shown to improve mortality, neonatal morbidities including sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic lung disease, growth parameters or neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age. Summary Parenteral amino acid administration in VLBW infants should be initiated soon after birth at a dose of at least 1.5 g/kg/day to maintain anabolism. The maximum dose for parenteral amino acid should be between 2.5 and 3.5 g/kg/day, with adequate nonprotein calories and micronutrients to ensure efficient protein utilization and growth.

J	Zielinkiewicz, K; Mijowska, E				Zielinkiewicz, Klaudia; Mijowska, Ewa			A sustainable and efficient strategy for stable three-layered borophene fabrication	SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES												Borophene, a promising two-dimensional material with unique properties, has garnered substantial interest in the realms of nanotechnology and materials science. Despite its potential applications, complex synthesis methods hinder extensive exploration. This study aims to establish a sustainable and scalable fabrication route by employing biocompatible intercalants (sodium cholate, sodium chloride, and urea) in a ball mill, coupled with ultrasound-assisted liquid phase exfoliation (UA-LPE) in water as a medium. Sodium cholate (SC) proved the most efficient, yielding 4-layer borophene at optimal ball-milling conditions (450 rpm for 6 h). What is more, the influence of the weight ratio of SC and bulk boron (B) on the efficiency of exfoliation has been examined. The combination of ball milling and UA-LPE in water achieved a tuned borophene thickness of 3 layers. The airstability of 3- and 4-layered borophene samples demonstrated resistance to long-term oxidation, affirming their chemical resilience. The proposed mechanism elucidates the process of mechanical exfoliation using SC boosted by UA-LPE. This two-step strategy offers a scalable, facile, efficient, and environmentally friendly approach to obtaining bulk-scale and stable 3-layered borophene samples, facilitating practical applications in line with theoretical studies.

Seasonality of biogeochemically relevant microbial genes in a coastal ocean microbiome	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Microbes drive the biogeochemical cycles of marine ecosystems through their vast metabolic diversity. While we have a fairly good understanding of the spatial distribution of these metabolic processes in various ecosystems, less is known about their seasonal dynamics. We investigated the annual patterns of 21 biogeochemical relevant functions in an oligotrophic coastal ocean site by analysing the presence of key genes, analysing high-rank gene taxonomy and the dynamics of nucleotide variants. Most genes presented seasonality: photoheterotrophic processes were enriched during spring, phosphorous-related genes were dominant during summer, coinciding with potential phosphate limitation, and assimilatory nitrate reductases appeared mostly during summer and autumn, correlating negatively with nitrate availability. Additionally, we identified the main taxa driving each function at each season and described the role of underrecognized taxa such as Litoricolaceae in carbon fixation (rbcL), urea degradation (ureC), and CO oxidation (coxL). Finally, the seasonality of single variants of some families presented a decoupling between the taxonomic abundance patterns and the functional gene patterns, implying functional specialization of the different genera. Our study unveils the seasonality of key biogeochemical functions and the main taxonomic groups that harbour these relevant functions in a coastal ocean ecosystem.

Previous clinical studies revealed that electrolyzed hydrogen water (EHW) is effective to reduce oxidative stress during hemodialysis in patients with chronic dialysis. In the present observational study, we investigated the antioxidant effects of a daily continuous intake of EHW in healthy adults. The concentrations of serum reactive oxygen metabolites-derived compounds (d-ROMs) and blood urea nitrogen in healthy volunteers (n = 64) who had a habit of intake over 500 mL/day of EHW at least 5 days a week for longer than 6 months were lower than those of age-and sex-matched controls (n = 470) without the habit of EHW intake. Oxidation stress index which the ratio between concentrations in d-ROMs and biological antioxidant potential was correlated with the serum concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the EHW group. These re-sults suggest that the continuous intake of EHW induces antioxidant effects and may contribute to alleviate the risk of various oxidative stress-related dysfunctions and diseases in healthy adults.

Possible modulating impact of glutathione disulfide mimetic on physiological changes in irradiated rats	HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												Glutathione disulfide mimetic (NOV-002) is a complex of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) formulated with cisplatin at approximately 1000: I molar ratio. Cisplatin serves to stabilize GSSG but does not assert any therapeutic effect. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of NOV-002 on hematological suppression, excessive free radical damage and DNA fragmentation in splenocytes, and metabolite disorders in whole-body gamma-irradiated rats. The obtained data revealed that rats treated with 25 mg kg(-1) NOV-002 injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 5 days after whole-body gamma-irradiation (IR) at 6.5 Gy attenuated the decrease of red blood cells, platelets, total white blood cells, absolute lymphocytes and neutrophils counts, hematocrit value, and hemoglobin content. NOV-002 treatment inhibits serum advanced oxidation protein products, malondialdehyde concentrations as well as cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, and creatinine levels, while enhances glutathione content and superoxide dismutase activity and improves DNA fragmentation in splenocytes. These findings provide a better understanding of the NOV-002 modulating impact in whole-body gamma-rays-induced hematological toxicities, oxidative stress, and biological disturbances in gamma-irradiated rats and could enhance the tolerance to high doses of ionizing IR utilized in radiotherapy.																			0960-3271	1477-0903				APR	2015	34	4					364	371		10.1177/0960327114529452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0960327114529452								25205737					WOS:000353073900004

Prolonging the dyeing time of coarse melanin can improve the dye uptake of veneers, and the brightness value increases, and the reflectivity declines with the increase of dyeing time. The stained surface of the vessel is gradually covered by coarse melanin dye, and more melanin particles can be clearly observed accumulating together on the stained surface with agar. Infrared measurements show that the absorption peak of -C=O in carboxylic acid disappears at 1740 cm(-1), which can be attributed to the fact that -C=O (1776 cm(-1)) in an anhydride or ketone group is formed by further oxidation and condensation of agar and NaOH. The veneer dyed for 6 h showed a well light and water resistance. Additionally, dyeing can improve the wettability of water, phenolic resin, and urea formaldehyde resin on the surface of veneer. These results support the use of pigment secreted by stain fungi for wood and provide data for evaluating their use as sustainable materials for other applications.

It can provide pathogenicity to some opportunistic fungi via modulating cellular metabolite composition. Arthrobotrys oligospora is a typical invasion fungus to nematodes. Its ETF characterization is still unknown. Here, we showed that the mutations of A. oligospora ETF (Aoetf alpha and Aoetf beta) and its dehydrogenase (Aoetfdh) led to severe defects in mitochondrial integrity and blocked fatty acid metabolism. The pathogenicity-associated trap structures were completely suppressed when exposed to nematode-derived ascarosides and nutrition signals, including ammonia and urea. Compared to the wild-type strain, the nematode predatory activity was significantly reduced and delayed. But surprisingly, the rich nutrition could restore the massive trap and robust predatory activity in the mutant Aoetf beta beyond all induction cues. Moreover, the deletion of Aoetf beta has led to the accumulation of butyrate-like smell, which has a strong attraction to Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. Ultimately, ETF and its dehydrogenase play a crucial role in nematode-trapping fungi, highlighting mitochondrial metabolite fluctuations that are connected to pathogenesis and further regulating the interactions between fungi and nematodes.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopic Study of Some Organic and Inorganic Modified Clay Minerals	MATERIALS												Layered clay systems intercalated with inorganic and organic compounds were analyzed to highlight how XPS can provide information on the different environments surrounding a particular atom as well as provide discernments on the size, coordination, and structural and oxidative transformations of the intercalating/pillaring compounds. XPS data on the intercalation of urea and K-acetate in low- and high-defect kaolinite revealed the interaction of the intercalating group NH2 with the siloxane functional groups in the interlayer surface. The intercalation of HDTMA in Mt demonstrated the use of XPS in monitoring the change in conformation assumed by alkylammonium intercalating compounds in Mt with increasing CEC. Studies on the pillaring of Mt by Al-13 and Ga-13 by XPS allowed determination of the coordination of the pillaring compound within the Mt layer. Lastly, the intercalation of hexacyanoferrate in hydrotalcite demonstrated the capability of XPS in following changes in the oxidation state of the iron compound. These were gleaned from interpretation of the shifts in binding energies and presence of multiplet splitting in the XPS of the component elements of the minerals or the intercalating compounds.

Aniline-nonamer segmented polyurea: A facile electrocatalyst for detection of ascorbic acid	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE												An unprecedented A-B-A type block copolymer electroactive polyurea (EPU) is designed and synthesized with tetraaniline dimer and 1,4-phenylenediamine via an oxidative coupling, where aniline-nonamer and hexamethylene di-urea constitute two segments. The EPU was characterized by spectral techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and UV-vis spectra. The structural characterization of the prepared EPU was obtained by powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. EPU reorganizes into core-shell microcapsules in presence of aqueous acetic acid/n-octane interface. These microcapsules exhibited a wide range of pH responses in their absorption spectrum (UV-vis). The EPU is modified as carbon paste electrode which exhibits a remarkable electrocatalytic oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA, Vitamin C) in 0.2 M and pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution. The carbon paste electrode is useful in sensing as low as 50 mu M of ascorbic acid. This can open up new opportunities for fast, simple detection of AA providing a promising platform for sensor/biosensor designs for AA detection. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

In this study, Cr2O3-MnOx composite material was synthesized via hydrothermal method and further applied as the cathode in aqueous zinc-ion batteries. By optimizing the chromium-to-manganese ratio and the amount of urea, and optimizing the hydrothermal and calcination conditions, the composite material with the best electrochemical performance was obtained. At the current density of 50 mA/g, the maximum capacity reached 384.7 mAh/g, and the cycling stability was also good. The physical characterization of the composite material with the most stable electrochemical performance reveals that its microstructure mainly consists of nanoparticles and nanocubes. The EDS elemental distribution tests show a relatively uniform distribution of manganese, chromium, and oxygen elements. The infrared and Raman spectroscopy indicate the stretching vibrations of Cr-O and Mn-O bonds. The XPS analysis reveals that the primary valence state of Cr is trivalent, while Mn exists in + 2, + 3, and + 4 oxidation states. The quantitative fitting analysis of XRD data shows that Cr2O3 is the predominant component.

Nevertheless, the large radius of potassium-ions results in sluggish potassiation kinetics and huge volume expansion, leading to unsatisfying performance. Herein, a fabrication facile, cost-effective and high carbon yield nitrogen/oxygen co-doped amorphous carbon (NOC) with pitch and urea as precursors is reported. Pre-oxidation process is employed, maintaining the amorphous structure of pitch derived carbon against its soft carbon nature. The NOC electrode delivers reversible capacities of 347 (300th cycle) and 167 mAh g(-1) (1000th cycle) at 100 and 2000 mA g(-1), respectively. Rearrangement of graphene layers in short range benefits the structure stability against volume change. Kinetics analyses prove that surface-induced capacitive process dominates in K-ion storage mechanism, which contributes to the remarkable electrochemical performance. Pouch full cells were assembled, delivering a capacity of 316 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). In view of the cost-effectiveness and electrochemical performance, this work offers a strategy for the fabrication of low-cost and high-performance PIB anode materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the urea/NH3-SCR process implemented in recent vehicles still suffers from a poor activity in the low temperature range (T < 250 degrees C). One main reason is its dependency against the NO2/NOx ratio, limiting the expected fast-SCR reaction in this temperature range. Recently, we shown that the addition of ethanol to ammonia led to a significant increase of the activity of a Ag/Al2O3 catalyst in this low temperature range. Moreover, in a dual-bed configuration (Ag/Al2O3 + WO3/Ce-x-ZryO2), a remarkable improvement was achieved at low temperature using only NO as NOx. The present work aims to highlight the DeNO(x) chemistry encountered over the WO3/Ce-x-ZryO2 catalyst in a bifunctional (EtOH + NH3) mixture. In addition to the fact that this process takes advantage of the low temperature NO2 formation over the upstream Ag/Al2O3 catalyst, this work also puts in evidenced unexpected interactions between NO2 and CH3CHO (resulting from ethanol oxidation over Ag/Al2O3) thus leading to NO emission.

J	Chen, JM; Zhang, RL; Peng, J; Xu, M; Hu, ZY; Wu, FS				Chen, Jiaming; Zhang, Ruilin; Peng, Jun; Xu, Man; Hu, Zhiyuan; Wu, Fengshou			Facile preparation of arginine-based carbon dots for highly selective detection of dopamine	DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS												Arginine-based carbon dots (Arg-CDs) were synthesized through a facile one-step hydrothermal method using arginine and urea as precursors. The as-prepared Arg-CDs displayed good aqueous solubility and typical excitation-dependent emission property, with the fluorescence quantum yield of 25.47 %. The fluorescence of Arg-CDs was gradually quenched by the addition of dopamine (DA) in the alkaline solution. However, under neutral and acidic condition, the fluorescence intensity of Arg-CDs remained unchanged upon the addition of DA. The sensing mechanism was probably due to the rapid oxidation of DA to dopaquinone in alkaline condition, which could quench the fluorescence of Arg-CDs through the Inner Filter Effect (IFE). Moreover, the fluorescence change of Arg-CDs was proportional to the concentration of DA under the optimized condition. Because of the linear relationship, the detection limit of dopamine was calculated to be 0.28 mu M with the detection range from 10 to 100 mu M. The interference experiment was carried out to further verify the specificity of this fluorometric method. Finally, the fluorometry based on Arg-CDs has been successfully used to the determination of DA in human serum with high accuracy and satisfactory recovery.					zhang, ruilin/J-5074-2013; Hu, Zhiyuan/JPX-7229-2023; Chen, JiaMing/JGM-6996-2023														0925-9635	1879-0062				JUN	2024	146								111271	10.1016/j.diamond.2024.111271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diamond.2024.111271		JUN 2024											WOS:001251435000001

The present study demonstrated the fabrication of magnesium ferrite and its Al-Cr co-doped derivatives; MgAlxCrxFe2-2xO4 (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) by urea assisted polymeric citrate route combustion method. The structure, topographical features and elemental composition of all the prepared samples were analyzed using Xray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to investigate the anticorrosion behavior of the thin coating of prepared nanomaterials for carbon steel in an acidic medium. Electrochemical impedance measurements revealed the monolayer formation of nanomaterials on the steel surface, which is effective in protecting the steel from oxidation. It enhanced the blockage of the pathway for water and oxygen to react with iron to form iron oxide. The MgAl0.5Cr0.5FeO4 exhibited the highest corrosion inhibition efficiency among the prepared samples with charge transfer resistance of 27 k Omega. The 0.025 g/L of nanomaterial dosage and 2 h of immersion time are appropriate for better corrosion resistance.

J	Li, ZH; Yang, Q; Chen, CC; Zhang, ZG; Fang, XM				Li, Zehao; Yang, Qian; Chen, Chengcheng; Zhang, Zhengguo; Fang, Xiaoming			Enhanced photocatalytic performance of polymeric C3N4 doped with theobromine composed of an imidazole ring and a pyrimidine ring	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS												Molecular doping has been proven to be an effective approach to adjusting the electronic structure of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) and thus improving its optical properties and photocatalytic activity. Herein, theobromine, a compound composed of an imidazole ring and a pyrimidine ring, was first copolymerized with urea to prepared doped PCN. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate that, a narrowing in band gap and a positive shift in valence band positon happened to the theobromine doped PCN, owing to the synergistic effect between the pyrimidine ring and the imidazole ring in the theobromine molecule. Moreover, it is shown that the doping with theobromine at a suitable mass fraction makes the obtained sample exhibit decreased photo luminescent emission, enhanced photocurrent density, and reduced charge-transport resistance. Consequently, an enhancement in the photocatalytic activity for water oxidation is found for the sample, which oxygen evolution rate is 4.43 times higher than that of the undoped PCN. This work sheds light on the choice of the molecular dopants for PCN to improve its photocatalytic performance. (C) 2019, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Constraining the composition and quantity of organic matter used by abundant marine Thaumarchaeota	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Marine Group I (MGI) Thaumarchaeota were originally described as chemoautotrophic nitrifiers, but molecular and isotopic evidence suggests heterotrophic and/or mixotrophic capabilities. Here, we investigated the quantity and composition of organic matter assimilated by individual, uncultured MGI cells from the Pacific Ocean to constrain their potential for mixotrophy and heterotrophy. We observed that most MGI cells did not assimilate carbon from any organic substrate provided (glucose, pyruvate, oxaloacetate, protein, urea, and amino acids). The minority of MGI cells that did assimilate it did so exclusively from nitrogenous substrates (urea, 15% of MGI and amino acids, 36% of MGI), and only as an auxiliary carbon source (< 20% of that subset's total cellular carbon was derived from those substrates). At the population level, MGI assimilation of organic carbon comprised just 0.5%-11% of total biomass carbon. We observed extensive assimilation of inorganic carbon and urea- and amino acid-derived nitrogen (equal to that from ammonium), consistent with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses performed here and previously showing a widespread potential for MGI to perform autotrophy and transport and degrade organic nitrogen. Our results constrain the quantity and composition of organic matter used by MGI and suggest they use it primarily to meet nitrogen demands for anabolism and nitrification.

However, their potential toxicity has not been thoroughly examined. The goal of the present study is to examine hepatic effects associated with the ingestion of TDNF. TDNF was fabricated via electrospinning method and characterized. Six to seven weeks old male Sprague Dawley rats ingested (oral gavage) a total of 0 ppm, 40, 60 ppm TDNF for two weeks. After sacrifice, the liver was assessed for cellular effects using proteomic approach. The fibers diameter ranged from 0.18 - 0.29 mu m, forming clusters and majority of the fibers were in the rutile phase. Proteomics assessment revealed more that more than 400 hundred proteins in the liver may be affected. These proteins are involved in such processes as catalysis of fatty acids by CoA, homocysteine metabolism, beta oxidation and the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate in the urea cycle among others. Further analysis of the protein associations showed that 325 biological processes, 140 molecular functions and 70 cellular components appear to be affected from the ingestion of TNDF.

Deep eutectic solvents as reusable catalysts and promoter for the greener syntheses of small molecules: Recent advances	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS												Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are significant environmentally benign media in the field of green chemistry. They are known not only for their inexpensive nature, biodegradability, non-toxicity, and bioavailability, but also for recyclability and their ease of preparation and purification. DESs are made up of hydrogen bond donor substituents (such as urea, carboxylic acid, glycerol, metals, etc.) and hydrogen bond acceptor substituents such as halide salts; they have a lower melting point than each substituent comprising the mixture. DESs find applications in biotransformation, gas separation, biomass valorization, electrochemistry, extraction, and dissolution process as well as in material chemistry and other assorted fields of chemistry. Interestingly, DESs fulfil a unique dual role as green solvents, promoters and catalysts in organic syntheses. Thus, it is noteworthy that chemical progresses and transformation with external catalysts in cross-coupling reactions, oxidations and reductions are not covered in this overview. This review mostly focuses on leading-edge applications of DES as a reusable catalyst in the expeditious synthesis of assorted small molecules central in the assembly of broad-spectrum pharmaceuticals, and total synthesis of common natural products.

Photoactivity of N-doped ZnO nanoparticles in oxidative and reductive reactions	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												N-doped ZnO is a prospective material for photocatalytic reactions. However, only oxidative paths are well investigated in the literature. This paper describes a comparative study about ZnO and ZnO:N potential for oxidative and reductive reactions, probed by rhodamine B dye photodegradation and CO2 photoreduction. The materials were prepared by the polymeric precursor method, using urea as a nitrogen source, and different heat treatments were used to observe their effects on surface decontamination, crystallinity, particle sizes and shapes, and photocatalytic performance. ZnO and ZnO:N presented a wurtzite crystalline structure and nanometric-scale particles. Samples submitted to higher temperatures showed lower specific surface areas, but higher crystallinity and lower contents of species adsorbed on their surfaces. On the other hand, the photocatalysts annealed in shorter times presented smaller crystallite sizes and lower crystallinity. These factors influenced the photoactivity in both conditions, i.e., oxidation and reduction reactions, under the ultraviolet and visible light, indicating that structural factors influenced the adequate charge separation and consequent photocatalytic activity since the as-synthesized samples were versatile photocatalysts in both redox reactions.

According to a series of electrochemical results, the growth of CuAl LDH on SPC decreases the charge-transfer resistance in the surface of modified carbon paste electrode (CPE). At an optimum potential of + 0.40 V, the CuAl LDH/SPC modified CPE depicted a wide linear range over a concentration of 0.1 to 1450 mu M with a detection limit of 0.03 mu M (S/N = 3). Significantly, the established assay demonstrated a strong resistance to interference from common substances such as fructose, valine, ascorbic acid, urea, L-cysteine, and uric acid. The suggested assay was successfully employed to detect glucose in sport drinks with satisfactory results. The modified electrode with CuAl LDH/SPC presents improved electro-catalytic properties, operating at a lower working potential. It demonstrates rapid response, high stability, and reproducibility in the oxidation of glucose. These features make it a promising candidate for the development of non-enzymatic glucose sensors in the future.																			2193-4126	2193-4134				2024 SEP 28	2024										10.1007/s11694-024-02892-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-024-02892-1		SEP 2024											WOS:001324515100002

Transition metal based catalysts with double metal composition exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER or UOR due to their synergetic effect and coupling of different active sites. However, the development of OER/UOR bifunctional electrocatalysts is unsatisfying and the role of each metallic active site in the OER and UOR is still unclear. Herein, we report a Fe-Mn based OER and UOR bifunctional catalyst through a simple one-step electrodeposition method. For the OER, the introduction of Mn improves the conductivity of the catalysts and fine-tunes the electron density of the Fe active sites. For the UOR, both Fe and Mn act as active sites and their coupling effect further improves the UOR activity. The catalyst with the optimal Mn/Fe ratio achieved an overpotential of 237 mV for the OER and a potential of 1.35 V for the UOR at 100 mA cm(-2). This study provides a simple synthesis protocol for constructing bifunctional catalysts for green hydrogen production.					li, zhihao/HLW-8433-2023; zhen, li/KGK-6604-2024; Li, Can/ABC-7294-2021; Li, Zhen/E-9341-2015	Li, Can/0000-0003-2771-6968; Li, Zhen/0000-0003-1177-2818													1477-9226	1477-9234				NOV 8	2022	51	43					16605	16611		10.1039/d2dt02780a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2dt02780a		OCT 2022						36268588					WOS:000870689700001

We directly synthesized LixAl2-LDH NC arrays by oxidation of aluminum foil substrate under a urea and lithium solution. Various lithium salts, including Cl-, CO32-, NO3-, and SO42-, were applied in aqueous solution to confirm the anion effect on the captured and released lithium quantity of the LixAl2-LDH NCs. In a 5% solution of sulfate ions mix with lithium chloride, the LixAl2-LDH NCs separated a larger quantity of lithium than in other anion conditions. To enhance regeneration stability and lithium selectivity, thin layers of SiO2 were coated onto the LixAl2-LDH nanostructure arrays for inhibition of nanostructure destruction after desorption of lithium cations in hot water. The LixAl2-LDH@SiO2 nanostructures showed enhanced properties for lithium adsorption, including increase of stable regeneration cycles from three to five cycles, and they showed high lithium selectivity in the Mg2+, Na+, and K+ cation mixed aqueous resource. Our nanostructured LDH lithium adsorbents would provide a facile and efficient application for cost-efficient and large-scale lithium production.

Conventional stabilisers for nitrocellulose-based propellants belong to a-aromatic amines (e.g., diphenylamine, 4-nitro-N-methylaniline...) or b-aromatic urea derivatives (e.g., Akardite, centralite...) and are/or produce highly toxic and/or potentially carcinogenic species at some point during a propellant's lifetime. There is an obvious need for alternative stabilisers presenting a low toxicity profile and providing efficiencies similar to, or better than conventional stabilisers. This paper presents novel, environmentally friendly, efficient and readily-available stabilisers for use in nitrocellulose-based compositions. With REACh legislation (1907/2006), industry in Europe has made progress in using less toxic compounds, that are often more environmentally-friendly. The aim of this work is to go beyond REACh and to anticipate the inclusion of other molecules that produce non- or less toxic daughter products and that can fulfil their role in the propellant's formulation.																			0721-3115	1521-4087				AUG	2018	43	8					831	837		10.1002/prep.201800026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prep.201800026													WOS:000441757900012

Facile electrodeposition of biphasic CuSx/CoSx nanostructures as bifunctional electrocatalysts for seawater splitting	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												Development of seawater splitting is essential for the sustainable hydrogen energy production via electro-catalysis. In this study, a facile electrodeposition technique is adopted to design a copper sulfide/cobalt sulfide biphasic composition on nickel foam as bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In saline water, bi-phasic CoSx/CuSx@NF catalyst provides the minimal overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and 390 mV at 100 mA cm-2 for OER. The electrode exhibits the Tafel slope of 133.4 mV dec- 1 . CoSx/CuSx@NF catalyst also provides the minimal overpotential of 113 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for HER. From FESEM analysis, it was deduced that the interconnected nanosheet and nanoflower structure in CoSx/CuSx@NF provides high surface area and lowered interfacial resistance for improving OER and HER activity. The catalyst shows excellent multifunctional activity in urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The electrodes showed good stability in alkaline, chloride solutions by retaining its activity up to 24 h for OER and 60 hrs for HER. This study demonstrates a highly stable, reproducible, cost-effective electrodeposited biphasic catalyst for OER, HER, and UOR.

In order to evaluate the performance of microfibrillated cellulose from different (ligno-) cellulosic raw materials for this purpose, softwood and hardwood powder were fibrillated and compared to sugar beet pulp as a representative non-wood cellulose resource, and conventional microfibrillated cellulose produced from bleached pulp. An alkali pre-treatment of woody and sugar beet raw materials enhanced the degree of fibrillation achieved, same as TEMPO-mediated oxidation of microfibrillated cellulose. Nanopapers produced from fibrillated material showed highly variable density and mechanical performance, demonstrating that properties may be tuned by the choice of raw material. While nanopaper strength was highest for TEMPO-oxidated microfibrillated cellulose, fibrillated untreated sugar beet pulp showed the best adhesive performance. Different microscopic methods (AFM, SEM, light microscopy) examined the interface between wood and fibrillated material, showing particular distinctions to commercial adhesives. It is proposed that fibrillated material suspensions, which achieve bond strength up to 60% of commercial urea-formaldehyde adhesive, may provide a viable solution to bio-based adhesives in certain applications where wet-strength is not an issue.

A series of NGAs samples with different GO:urea:EDA mass ratios were obtained and characterized by Raman, FT-IR, XPS, TEM and SEM. The prepared NGAs were employed as metal-free carbocatalysts in the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for 2-sec-butyl-4,6-dinitrphenol (DNBP) degradation in aqueous solution. The resultant NGA-4 catalyst with GO:urea:EDA mass ratio of 3:2:4 exhibited the best catalytic activity in PMS activation for oxidative degradation of DNBP among the prepared NGAs samples. The effects of temperature, initial pH value, catalyst concentration and PMS dosage on the degradation of DNBP in NGA-4/PMS system were investigated. The catalytic degradation of DNBP followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic and the activation energy of the degradation reaction was calculated to be 31.3 kJ mol(-1). The quenching experiments clearly demonstrated that SO4- radicals served as predominant active species in the PMS activation catalytic process. The good applicability made the application of the prepared NGAs materials in PMS activation for removing organic pollutants more practical and feasible.

This study developed Au/TiO2 catalysts through the urea deposition method, subsequently integrating them with iron phthalocyanine (FePc) via ball milling, resulting in FePc/Au-TiO2. These catalysts were calcined at various temperatures. The results indicated that Au nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on TiO2, and Fe in FePc/Au TiO2 calcined at 410 degrees C mainly exists in the form of ferrosoferric oxide (Fe3O4). FePc/Au-TiO2 with 30 % FePc which calcined at 410 degrees C demonstrated outstanding photocatalytic activity, achieving a 97 % yield of FDCA. The effects of various experimental parameters on the conversion of HMF to FDCA were investigated, such as the calcination temperatures, the FePc amount, base, and catalyst dosage. Electron paramagnetic resonance and active species capture tests revealed the catalyst can convert O2 into center dot O2- and 1O2 through excited electrons and photogenerated holes. This study highlights the role of interfacial coupling interactions in boosting catalytic performance, offering a novel approach for photocatalyst development in converting HMF to FDCA.

The physical properties of these samples were verified through X-Ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. The Cu/Cu2O and Cu/CuO/Cu2O electrodes were employed as non-enzyme sensors for the detection of glucose in the alkaline solution. The properties of electrodes were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry measurements with glucose solution. The results show that both types of electrodes can detect and quantify glucose concentrations. The Cu/Cu2O/CuO composite electrode demonstrated superior performance compared to the Cu/Cu2O electrode. The proposed sensor demonstrated a limit of detection of approximately 63.08 nM. Additionally, the proposed sensor was also investigated with various interfering substances, including ascorbic acid, urea, and table salt. The results revealed that the current intensity remained nearly unchanged for these substances, while it significantly increased from 0.3 to 2.5 mA/cm2 for glucose. With these achieved results, the developed system shows promise for application in glucose testing systems, benefiting diabetic patients in the future.

They are structural and functional elements of cell respiration with the electron transport system (ETS), whose role is to provide adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy. The Krebs cycle and fatty acid oxidation take place within mitochondria. Other metabolic pathways and cycles include some steps inside and outside the mitochondria (e.g., the urea cycle, steroid biosynthesis, heme biosynthesis, and cardiolipin synthesis). Dysfunction of mitochondria plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases including degenerative diseases, aging, and cancer, etc. Nowadays the interest of the mitochondrial respiratory function is still increasing due to their importance in the physiology and pathophysiology of an organism. Neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y is widely used as an in vitro model in neurodegenerative diseases, where mitochondrial dysfunction is considered as a key mechanism in pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. This paper gives first insight into the mitochondrial respiration and characterization of SH-SY5Y cells, with basic information of respiration in different coupling control states including ROUTINE, LEAK, and maximal electron transport (ET) capacity.

Compared to conventional biological treatment, photocatalytic processes show more efficiency in degrading MPs, but they require expensive materials and complicated synthesis processes. This study developed an economic photocatalytic process to degrade micropollutants. We synthesized urea-based graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by a facile one-step pyrolysis method and evaluated the photocatalytic efficiency of carbamazepine (CBZ). Under simulated solar irradiation, g-C3N4 could achieve 100% removal efficiency of 0.1 mg/L CBZ in spiked wastewater effluent within 15 min, and 86.5% removal efficiency in wastewater influent after 20 min of irradiation. The porous structure of g-C3N4 promoted effective charge separation and mass transport of CBZ near the catalyst surface, enabling a high kinetic rate (0.3662 min (-1)). Reactive oxygen species trapping experiments revealed that superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) and holes (h(+)) were the major active radicals. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) further confirmed the presence of O-2(center dot-), (OH)-O-center dot, O-1(2) and holes. The pH, light intensity and initial CBZ concentration were found to have significant impacts on the removal efficiency of CBZ. Possible reaction intermediates were identified and the degradation pathway was proposed. Multiple MPs were selected to further demonstrate photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4. The facile synthesis, superior efficiency, and versatility of g-C3N4 make it a promising catalyst for application in tertiary wastewater treatment processes. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In order to achieve an economically efficient performance at an industrial scale, a novel porous millimeter-sized sorbent with resonable CO2 capacity is designed. The sorbent is prepared simply via suspension copolymerization of water-in-oil emulsion. Functionalized tetraethylenepentamine is encapsulated into the sorbent, which greatly maximizes amine efficiency, as the functionalized tetraethylenepentamine promotes CO2 desorption at a relatively low temperature, and maintains amine stability against oxidation and urea formation. At mean time, acrylate copolymerization and surface crosslinking ensure strong hydrophobicity of framework and surface as well as sufficient toughness against abrasion during fluidization operation. The CO2 working capacity of sorbent is 1.9 mmol.g(-1). A rapid adsorption/desorption kinetics and long-persistent stability have been obtained under complicated atmospheric environments and fully fluidized state. The energy penalty for sorbent regeneration is 2.15 MJ.kg(-1)(CO2) in the presence of water, indicating a promising application prospect in CO2 capture from flue gas.					杨, 杨川箬/KYR-7440-2024	Yang, Chuanruo/0009-0009-7639-3027													0306-2619	1872-9118				FEB 15	2020	260								114265	10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114265													WOS:000515108700013

The structure and chemical information were checked by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The aggregate structure, thermal stability, phase behavior and morphology were examined via X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. It was found that the obtained SLIPs were disordered pore materials with amorphous structures and high stability, and the influence of varied isocyanate monomers on their properties was associated with hydrogen bonding derived from urea linkage. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties for the SLIPs absorbing dimethyl sulfoxide were determined by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the results showed that the electrolytes could endure an oxidation potential up to 4.2V (vs. Li+/Li) and exhibited a practicable conductivity (10(-4) Scm(-1)) at 30 degrees C. The cycling performance for an Li|Li cell was also tested preliminarily. The obtained results indicated that the developed SLIPs could be used as potential polyelectrolytes in lithium batteries.																			0922-6168	1568-5675				DEC	2018	44	12					7187	7204		10.1007/s11164-018-3550-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11164-018-3550-6													WOS:000450575500002

Objective: We aimed to evaluate retrospectively whether breastfeeding and/or breast milk feeding are feasible in infants with IMDs including organic acidemias, fatty acid oxidation disorders, urea cycle disorders, aminoacidopathies or disorders of galactose metabolism. Methods: Data on breastfeeding and breast milk feeding as well as monitoring and neurological outcome were collected retrospectively from our database of patients with the mentioned IMD, who were followed in our metabolic center within the last 10 years. Results: Twenty patients were included in the study, who were either breast fed on demand or received expressed breast milk. All the infants were evaluated clinically and biochemically at 2-4-week intervals, with weight gain as the leading parameter to determine metabolic control. Good metabolic control and adequate neurological development were achieved in all patients but one, who experienced the only metabolic crisis observed within the study period. Conclusion: Breast milk feeding with close clinical and biochemical monitoring is feasible in most IMD and should be considered as it offers nutritional and immunological benefits.

In this review, we proposed a new generation of artificial nitrogen cycle via electrochemical and photocatalytic reactions. In details, the N-2 from the air, NO3-/NO2- containing wastewater, nitrogen oxides from vehicle emission are all able to be utilized as a nitrogen source for the synthesis of NH3 under ambient conditions. The oxidation of NH3, N-2 and nitrogen oxides can all achieve the aim of obtaining NO3-. Hydrazine can also be synthesized electrochemical and photochemical reactions. Utilizing electrochemical and photocat-alytic processes enables to eliminate the hazardous of nitrogen-containing organic chemicals, and some inorganic nitrogen polluted wastewater. More importantly, coupling N-based reaction with other reaction like CO2 reduction enables to synthesize some high-value chemicals such as urea. Then we highlighted some recent achievements in these reactions and proposed some future potential developing directions. The results and funding of this work may help us develop highly efficient catalysts and strategies for the artificial nitrogen cycle, repairing the broken nitrogen cycle balance.					wei, wei/HHR-8613-2022; Kong, Qiang/L-9199-2019; Ni, Bing-Jie/ABB-5631-2021; HAO, Derek/K-2407-2019; Liu, Yang/JMR-0596-2023; Bai, Xiaojuan/A-3466-2019; Liu, Yang/N-8925-2018	Hao, Derek/0000-0001-9981-7499; Bai, Xiaojuan/0000-0002-1233-2112; Ni, Bing-Jie/0000-0002-1129-7837; Wei, Wei/0000-0001-5613-337X; Liu, Yang/0000-0001-6478-9985													1369-7021	1873-4103				JUN	2021	46						212	233		10.1016/j.mattod.2021.01.029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mattod.2021.01.029		JUN 2021											WOS:000661424700002

This study has investigated the preventive effect of the extract and fractions of Ribes khorasanicum on APAP-induced liver and kidney damage. In this experiment, after analysis of the extract using FTIR, toxicity was induced by APAP on the 7th day. Before that, the extract and their aqueous, ethyl acetate, and n-hexane fractions were administrated orally. 24 h after APAP administration, the animals were sacrificed. The liver and kidney were removed for the evaluation of oxidation and biochemical markers, including SGOT, SGPT, ALP, LDH, albumin, urea, creatinine, and bilirubin and also for histopathological evaluations. The safety of the extract was evaluated based on the MTT. Also, expression of the NF-kB is done. Administration of Ribes khorasanicum significantly decreased the biochemical parameters compared to the APAP.

However, the sluggish kinetics of the Al-S battery reactions produces very high overpotentials. Here, for the first time, it was demonstrated that the incorporation of redox mediators could dramatically improve the kinetics of Al-S batteries. On the example of iodide redox mediators, it was shown that the charging voltage of Al-S batteries could be decreased by about 0.23 V with as little as 2.3 wt% of redox mediator added as electrolyte additive. Control electrochemical measurements, without prior discharge of the battery, demonstrated that >97 % of the charge capacity was due to the desired oxidation of Al2S3 and polysulfides, and X-ray diffraction experiments confirmed the formation of sulfur as the final charge product. The beneficial role of redox mediators was demonstrated with cheap and environmentally friendly electrolytes made of urea and AlCl3. This work showed that dramatic performance improvements could be achieved with low concentration of electrolyte additives, and therefore, much further performance improvements could be sought by combining multiple additives.

However, the differentiation of hiPSCs into fully functional hepatocytes remains a major challenge. Despite the importance of the information carried by metabolomes, the exploitation of metabolomics for characterizing and understanding hiPSC differentiation remains largely unexplored. Here, to increase knowledge of hiPSC maturation into mature hepatocytes, we investigated their metabolomics profiles during sequential step-by-step differentiation: definitive endoderm (DE), specification into hepatocytes (HB-pro (hepatoblast progenitors)), progenitor hepatocytes (Pro-HEP) and mature hepatocytelike cells (HLCs). Metabolomics analysis illustrated a switch from glycolysis-based respiration in DE step to oxidative phosphorylation in HLCs step. DE was characterized by fatty acid beta oxidation, sorbitol metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway, and glutamine and glucose metabolisms as various potential energy sources. The complex lipid metabolism switch was monitored via the reduction of lipid production from DE to HLCs step, whereas high glycerol production occurred mainly in HLCs. The nitrogen cycle, via urea production, was also a typical mechanism revealed in HLCs step. Our analysis may contribute to better understanding of differentiation and suggest new targets for improving iPSC maturation into functional hepatocytes.

However, detailed knowledge of the genomic properties of methanotrophs adapted to acidic soils remains scarce. Using metagenomic approaches, we analyzed methane-utilizing communities enriched from acidic forest soils with pH 3 and 4, and recovered near-complete genomes of proteobacterial methanotrophs. Novel methanotroph genomes designated KS32 and KS41, belonging to two representative clades of methanotrophs (Methylocystis of Alphaproteobacteria and Methylobacter of Gammaproteobacteria), were dominant. Comparative genomic analysis revealed diverse systems of membrane transporters for ensuring pH homeostasis and defense against toxic chemicals. Various potassium transporter systems, sodium/proton antiporters, and two copies of proton-translocating F1F0-type ATP synthase genes were identified, which might participate in the key pH homeostasis mechanisms in KS32. In addition, the V-type ATP synthase and urea assimilation genes might be used for pH homeostasis in KS41. Genes involved in the modification of membranes by incorporation of cyclopropane fatty acids and hopanoid lipids might be used for reducing proton influx into cells. The two methanotroph genomes possess genes for elaborate heavy metal efflux pumping systems, possibly owing to increased heavy metal toxicity in acidic conditions. Phylogenies of key genes involved in acid adaptation, methane oxidation, and antiviral defense in KS41 were incongruent with that of 16S rRNA. Thus, the detailed analysis of the genome sequences provides new insights into the ecology of methanotrophs responding to soil acidification.

Electrochemical sensing of mercury ions in electrolyte solutions by nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot electrodes at ultralow concentrations	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS												Electrochemical detection of mercury ions in aqueous solution was investigated at indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass electrode modified by nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-doped GQDs). The N-doped GQDs with an average particle size of 4.5 nm were synthesized through an infrared-assisted pyrolysis of citric acid and urea at 250 degrees C. The GQD sample contains high oxidation and amidation level, i.e., O/C and N/C atomic ratios: 37.6% and 30.7%, respectively. The electrochemical sensing toward Hg2+ ions was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Based on the CV and EIS analyses, both the reductive and oxidative peak currents as well as the equivalent series resistance demonstrate a decreasing trend with increased Hg2+ concentration. The detection limit of N-doped GQD/ITO electrodes toward Hg2+ ions reached 10 ppb with the accumulation time of 32 s. The GQD/ITO electrodes also exhibit superior selectivity toward the target contaminant (i.e. Hg2+ ion). Accordingly, the functionalized GQDs pave the way for engineering the electrochemical sensors capable of detecting toxic Hg2+ ions with superb sensitivity and selectivity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, a series of nitrogen/oxygen codoped activated carbons with an inverse opal-like structure derived from cellulose diacetate are successfully synthesized through hydrothermal reaction and subsequent chemical activation during which the fluxing effect of KOH is discovered for the first time. The introduction of nitrogen and intrinsic oxygen (especially carbonyl and quinone groups) contributes to additional pseudocapacitance. The experimental results show that the obtained product delivers 400.3 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in a three-electrode system and achieves extraordinary capacity retention of 90% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 A g-1. The energy density reaches as high as 8.8 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 0.25 kW kg-1 as symmetric supercapacitors, indicating a promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitors. The simple and cost-effective method requires no extra oxidation and excessive urea and thus provides new approaches for the future design of electrode materials. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, the impact of repeated applications of these inhibitors on nitrogen cycling microorganisms is not well documented. This study aimed to investigate the changes in the abundance and community structure of the functional microorganisms involved in nitrification and denitrification in Australian pasture soils after repeated applications of DMPP and nBTPT. Soil was collected in autumn and spring, 2014 from two pasture sites where control, urea, urea ammonium nitrate, and urea-coated inhibitors had been repeatedly applied over 2 year. Soil samples were analyzed to determine the potential nitrification rates (PNRs), the abundances of amoA, narG, nirK and bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and the community structure of ammonia oxidizers. Two years of urea application resulted in a significantly lower soil pH at Terang and a significant decrease in total bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance at Glenormiston and led to significantly higher PNRs and abundances of ammonia oxidizers compared to the control. Amendment with either DMPP or nBTPT significantly decreased PNRs and the abundance of amoA and narG genes. However, there was no fertilizer- or inhibitor-induced change in the community structure of ammonia oxidizers. These results suggest that there were inhibitory effects of DMPP and nBTPT on the functional groups mediating nitrification and denitrification, while no significant impact on the community structure of ammonia oxidizers was observed. The application of nitrification or urease inhibitor appears to be an effective approach targeting specific microbial groups with minimal effects on soil pH and the total bacterial abundance.

Mn-Cu-Al-TH nanocomposites were prepared using a facile microwave-assisted technique, and its hollow structure was created by continuous treatment with urea. The electrochemical activity of the Mn-Cu-Al-TH/NF electrode was examined by cyclic voltammetric techniques. It was identified that the Mn-Cu-Al-TH/NF electrode exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards glucose oxidation in alkaline medium (pH = 13), as compared with Mn-Cu-DH/NF and Mn-H/NF electrodes. The electrocatalytic activity of the modified electrode under various pH values has been investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the electrochemical sensor exhibits a linear sensitivity towards glucose from 5 mu M to 4 mM with a sensitivity of 2,108 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). Moreover, the glucose sensor demonstrated good selectivity, stability, fast response (<2 s), and repeatability. Our results suggest that Mn-Cu-Al-TH hollow-shelled layered triple hydroxide (LTH) nanocomposite could be a promising candidate for the construction of a nonenzymatic sensor.

This study prepared a new 2D hybrid photocatalyst (CBN-x) consisting of CN and h-BN using low-cost precursors (urea and boric acid). The effects of CN loading on the structure, surface chemistry and photocatalytic activities were systematically investigated. The photocatalytic activities of CBN-x samples were tested for the production of H-2 and H2O2, which demonstrated markedly enhanced activities without the need of noble metal co-catalysts. However, CBN-x activities for the photocatalytic oxidation of organic compound were not better than that of h-BN. Loading CN on h-BN sheets, C 2p and N 2p orbitals from CN introduce new valence and conduction band edges, which gradually narrowed the bandgap and enhanced light absorption efficiency of the hybrid photocatalysts. In such metal-free systems, electrons generated in CN transfer to h-BN, while photo-generated holes on h-BN transfer to CN, which enhances the charge separation through the heterojunction interface (CN/BN). Therefore, increasing the CN loading enhances the overall efficiency of photocatalysis until excessive loading of CN covers the active sites on h-BN.

Recently, 2D transition-metal- (TM-) based MOFs have become a hot topic in this field because of their high aspect ratio derived from their large lateral size and small thickness, as well as the advantages of MOFs. Moreover, 2D TM-based MOFs can act as good precursors to construct heterostructures with high electrical conductivity and abundant active sites for a range of applications. This review comprehensively introduces the widely adopted synthesis strategies of 2D TM-based MOFs and their composites/derivatives. In addition, this paper summarizes and highlights the recent advances in energy conversion and storage, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, urea oxidation reaction, batteries, and supercapacitors.

Morin may be used to prevent nephrotoxic and other side effects. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of the protective effects of morin on IFO induced nephrotoxicity. We used 35 male rats divided into five groups of seven: control group, morin group, IFO group, 100 mg/kg morin + IFO group and 200 mg/kg morin + IFO group. We measured kidney tissue oxidant, antioxidant and inflammatory parameters using ELISA, and apoptosis was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and real time PCR. Serum urea, creatinine and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels were increased by IFO treatment; elevated levels were decreased significantly by treatment with both 100 and 200 mg/kg morin. Morin treatment also decreased oxidative stress and lipid oxidation in IFO treated rats. The ameliorative effect of morin on inflammatory response was due to reduced levels of NF-kappa B and TNF-alpha. Morin also reduced NF-kappa B/p53 levels by increasing Bcl-2 expression in IFO treated kidneys. Morin may prevent IFO induced nephrotoxicity via the NF-kappa B/p53 and Bcl-2 signaling pathways.

Influence of structural modification on lubricant properties of sal fat-based lubricant base stocks	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS												Effect of structural modification of sal fatty acid-based branched mono- and polyol esters on lubricant properties was explored. In an attempt to improve the pour point of the sal fatty acid- based lubricant base stocks, enrichment of unsaturation in sal fat was carried out using urea adduct complexation method. Oleic acid rich (73.2% by GC) sal fatty acids were reacted with 2-ethylhexanol and polyols, namely, neopentyl glycol (NPG) and trimethylolpropane (TMP) to obtain the corresponding branched mono- and polyol esters. These were further epoxidized to their epoxy esters. All the base stocks were evaluated for lubricant properties and compared with different lubricant specifications. The oleic acid rich branched mono- and polyol esters exhibited low pour points (-9 degrees C to -3 degrees C) and high viscosity indices (178-201). While, the epoxy esters exhibited higher viscosities, high flash points, and good thermal and oxidation stabilities compared to sal fatty acid-based lubricant base stocks and their oleic acid rich polyol esters. Overall, all the base stocks have potential to be developed into hydraulic and metalworking fluids, and other industrial applications with appropriate formulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The morphology and chemical composition of the nanopigments were studied using SEM and EDS, respectively. The composition of the crystalline phase was examined using XRD. The crystallite sizes were calculated using the modified Scherrer method, Williamson-Hall method and size-strain plot method. Particles of the CoAl2O4-PVA sample have smaller crystallite sizes, whereas particles of the CoAl2O4-Urea sample have larger crystallite sizes. Thermal gravimetric analysis showed that thermal decomposition of cobalt(II) and aluminum nitrates is accompanied by the release of gases. As a result of material loosening, finely dispersed powders with high porosity were formed. FTIR-spectra of all the nanopigments contain absorption bands related to stretching vibrations of the Me-O bonds (400-700 cm(-1)). Stretching and deformation vibrations of water molecules are present as well. Color characteristics of the obtained nanopigments depend on the fuel used for the combustion synthesis. The pigment CoAl2O4-PVA has saturated blue-green color. The obtained spinel-type nanomaterials possess high suspension stability and can be used as pigments in ceramic technology.

In this study, the polysaccharide from black soybean hull (BSPS-H) was obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis, the yield was 5.3%, and its chemical composition and structural composition were further studied. The results shown that BSPS-H was mainly composed of Mannose, Galactose, and Glucose (molar ratio = 48.1: 29.7: 15.8), and might be existed in the form of pyran ring in alpha/beta-linkage type. The anti-oxidant activity shown that BSPS-H had a certain capacity of anti-oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner. Among them, it has the best scavenging effect on DPPH free radicals. When the polysaccharide concentration was 10 mg/ml, the scavenging rate reached 94.37%. The results of anti-fatigue effect indicated that BSPS-H could prolong the duration of exhaustive swimming in mice, increased the contents of liver glycogen, reduced the content of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), enhanced the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reduced the accumulation of lactic acid (LA). This study provides a fundamental basis for the development and use of BSPS-H in medicine and functional foods.

Based on the two-cycle catalytic mechanism proposed by Topsoe, in combination with the exhaust characteristics of the marine diesel, expansion studies on detailed SCR reaction model were carried out in this paper. According to the temperature dependence of reaction pathway, SCR reaction model was divided into three parts: low temperature reaction pathway, standard SCR reaction pathway, and high temperature oxidation pathways, and an expanded NH3-NO/NO2-SCR reaction model for V2O5 catalyst was proposed in the paper. In order to verify the accuracy of the expanded SCR reaction model, simulating and testing studies of SCR reaction under marine diesel conditions were carried out with a commercial extruded V2O5/TiO2 catalyst. The simulation values are agreed well with experimental values at 150-500 celcius, and kinetics characteristics of SCR reaction process under V2O5/TiO2 catalyst can be predicted accurately with the expanded NH3-NO/NO2-SCR reaction model.

Agricultural soils can be both a source and sink for atmospheric CH4. However, it is unclear how climate change, will affect CH4 emissions and the underlying functional guilds. In this field study, we determined the impact of simulated climate change (a warmer and drier condition) and its legacy effect on CH4 emissions and the methanogenic and methanotrophic communities, as well as their relationships with ammonia oxidizers in an acidic soil with urea application. The climate change conditions were simulated in a greenhouse, and the legacy effect was simulated by removing the greenhouse after twelve months. Simulated climate change significantly decreased the in situ CH4 emissions in the urea-treated soils while the legacy effect significantly decreased the in situ CH4 emissions in the control plots, but had very little effect in the urea-treated soils. This indicates that the impact of simulated climate change and its legacy on CH4 emissions was significantly modified by nitrogen fertilization. Methanotrophs were more sensitive than methanogens in response to simulated climate change and its legacy effect, especially in the urea treated soil. Significant negative correlations were observed between the abundances of ammonia oxidizers and methanotrophs. Additionally, results of partial least path modeling (PLS-PM) indicated that the interactions of methanogens and methanotrophs with ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) had significant positive relationships with in situ CH4 emissions under the simulated climate change condition. Our work highlights the important role of AOA for CH4 emissions under climate change conditions. Further research is needed to better understand this effect in other ecosystems.

Furthermore, a two-electrode electrolyzer was assembled with Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/NF utilized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the cathode and anode, giving rise to a low voltage of 1.51 V to concurrently produce FDCA and H2 at 50 mA cm-2. This work enlightens the significance of regulating redox activities of transition metals via interfacial engineering and constructing heterostructured electrocatalysts toward more efficient energy utilization.

However, the studies considering combined effects of biochar and SRF are rare. This study examined the combined effects of biochar and SRF on the biogeochemistry, rice productivity, methane emission, and microbial abundances in rice paddy. The study sites included six different treatment combinations: urea (NU), SRF (NS), straw + urea (SU), straw + SRF (SS), biochar + urea (BU), and biochar + SRF (BS). Both the biochar and SRF reduced the methane emission, and the BS paddy soil had the lowest methane emission, while it had the highest rice yield. The biochar inhibited methanogenesis by increasing the soil aeration and oxygen availability. The SRF decreased the plant biomass, thus they may decrease plant-mediated methane transport and carbon substrate from plant debris and root exudates. Increasing in the abundance of methane-oxidizing bacteria was assumed to have critical impact on the reduction in methane emission by biochar. In conclusion, combined application of biochar and SRF highly recommended in rice cultivation, because they can minimize the methane emission but maximize rice yield.

The investigated catalysts, Al2O3 - TiO2/CeO2/Fe2O3 (ATCF) and Al2O3- Nb2O5/CeO2/Fe2O3 (ANCF), were produced with impregnation method and aged for 6 h at 600 degrees C. FE-SEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy), XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) and BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) Surface Area analyzes were carried out to determine the specifications of catalysts. The catalytic performances of the DOCs were tested for the oxidation of CO, HC, PM, NO while SCR catalysts were tested for SCR of NOx using NH3. An individual exhaust system was built up and mounted to the engine for tests of catalysts. An electronic control system and a software were developed to control the SCR system. After the completion of experimental setup, catalysts placed inside the exhaust system were subjected to the engine tests to determine their effects on the exhaust emissions. Tests were carried out under actual working conditions with a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine. In conclusion, the catalysts made significant decrease in pollutant emissions while brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased slightly. ANCF released better conversion efficiency in all pollutant emissions compared to the ATCF. Maximum decreases in CO, HC and NOx emissions, which are resulted from ANCF catalyst, were obtained at a rate of 83.51%, 80.83% and 80.29% respectively.

The damage caused by oxidation of guanine, commonly referred to as oxidative guanine damage, results in the formation of several products, including 2,5-diamino-4H-imidazol-4-one (Iz), 2,2,4-triamino-5(2H)-oxazolone (Oz), guanidinoformimine (Gf), guanidinohydantoin/iminoallantoin (Gh/Ia), spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp), 5-carboxamido-5-formamido-2-iminohydantoin (2Ih), urea (Ua), 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole (NI), spirodi(iminohydantoin) (5-Si and 8-Si), triazine, the M+7 product, other products by peroxynitrite, alkylated guanines, and 8,5 '-cyclo-2 '-deoxyguanosine (cG). Herein, we summarize the present knowledge about base pairs containing the products of oxidative guanine damage and guanine. Of these products, Iz is involved in G-C transversions. Oz, Gh/Ia, and Sp form preferably Oz:G, Gh/Ia:G, and Sp:G base pairs in some cases. An involvement of Gf, 2Ih, Ua, 5-Si, 8-Si, triazine, the M+7 product, and 4-hydroxy-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (HICA) in G-C transversions requires further experiments. In addition, we describe base pairs that target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RNA viruses and describe implications for the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): When products of oxidative guanine damage are adapted for the ribonucleoside analogs, mimics of oxidative guanine damages, which can form base pairs, may become antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2.						, Hiroshi/0000-0002-9680-4796														1422-0067				OCT	2020	21	20							7645	10.3390/ijms21207645	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms21207645								33076559					WOS:000585757700001

The photocatalysts were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, particle size analyzer and surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, respectively. The photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4 prepared by different precursors for decolorization of rhodamine B aqueous solution were evaluated. The results show that g-C3N4 prepared by heating urea exhibits the best photocatalytic activity under simulated solar irradiation, which can be assigned to the relative higher specific surface area, the smaller particle size, the higher separation efficiency of photo-generated charge pairs, the higher adsorption toward rhodamine B aqueous solution.

The obtained samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction(XRD) and scanning electron microscopy(SEM). The results suggest that the crystallinity and size could be influenced by precipitants dosage(molar ratio of urea to BiCl3) and solventhermal time. BiOCl microspheres with sizes of 1-5 mu m were synthesized by tuning reaction conditions. The as-prepared BiOCl exhibited high photocatalytic efficiency towards the degradation of carbamazepine(CBZ) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) under UV light irradiation. Especially, BiOCl samples obtained at precipitants dosages of 10: 1 and 15: 1 with hydrothermal time of 30 min exhibited superior photocatalytic activity to TiO2(P25). The results indicate that the hierarchical BiOCl microspheres are promising candidate for the removal of the recalcitrant pharmaceutical contaminants.

Oxidative damage is implicated in many alterations caused by phthalate especially the di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), which is the most useful phthalate. However, information regarding its mechanism of renal damage is lacking. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates gene expression implicated in free radical scavenging and cytoprotection including the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) pathway. The aim of this study was to assess whether DEHP affects the Nrf2 pathway and the GSH concentration. Mice were divided into four groups: a control group and three groups treated with DEHP at different concentrations (5, 50, and 200 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days. Our results showed that DEHP altered the normal levels of serum biochemical parameters creatinine (CREA), urea, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This phthalate caused oxidative damage through the induction of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation as marked by increase of protein carbonyl (PC) and loss of protein-bound sulfhydryls (PSH). Simultaneously, DEHP treatment decreased the protein level of Nrf-2, HO-1, and GCLC (responsible of GSH synthesis) and decreased the GSH level. Inhibition of the Nrf2 pathway is related to the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This apoptotic process is evidenced by an upregulation of p53 and Bax protein levels in addition to a downregulation of Bcl-2. Collectively, our data demonstrated that depletion of Nrf2 and GSH was associated with the elevation of oxidative stress and the activation of intrinsic apoptosis in mouse kidney treated with DEHP.

SBA-15 was adopted as the hard template. The effect of urea to sucrose molar ratio on NOMC was investigated. NOMC samples were characterized by techniques such as BET, TEM, XPS and TG. The catalytic performances of NOMC catalysts were evaluated for the pyrolysis of 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-142b, CH3CClF2) to vinylidene fluoride (VDF, CH2=CF2). The catalytic reactions were carried out at 400 degrees C and space velocity of 600 h(-1) (based on HCFC-142b). The results indicate that NOMC exhibits a stable activity at 400 degrees C with high HCFC-142b conversion and selectivity to VDF. The textural parameters of NOMC play a major role in VDF selectivity and N species over the carbon surface are responsible for NOMC catalytic performance. Compared with the temperatures of industrial manufacture of VDF at 650-700 degrees C, the NOMC catalysts provide a promising pathway to produce VDF at much lower temperatures (below 400 degrees C).

DES was prepared by heating sulfamic acid and urea together at 80 degrees C at a molar ratio of 1:4, 1:3, or 1:2. Sulfation of cellulose was performed by mixing dry cellulose fibers with DES at 80 degrees C, followed by heating at 150 degrees C for half an hour. Anionic charge as high as 3mmol/g (degree of substitution of 0.68) was obtained with this simple chemical modification of cellulose at an elevated temperature using DES both as reaction media and reagent without any external solvent. The decrease in the urea content of DES improved the sulfation efficiency. In addition, the presence of urea led to the carbamation of cellulose to some extent. Cellulose sulfate (charge of 2.40mmol/g) became a gel-like material in water, and after passing once through a microfluidizator, a highly transparent nanocellulose gel (transmittance of 0.1% solution at a visible light range was over 95%) was obtained. Sulfated cellulose nanofibers (SCNFs) exhibited a width of around 4nm with a minor presence of elemental fibril aggregates (containing five or less elemental fibrils). SCNFs with high aspect ratio can have a potential end-use as a rheology modifier because of their high viscosity even at low concentrations or act as reinforcing additives. [GRAPHICS] .

Both algae strains were cultivated with five different nitrogen nutrients via (NH4)(2)SO4 (ammonium sulphate: AS), NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate: AN), KNO3 (potassium nitrate: PN), (NH2)(2)CO (urea: UR) and NaNO3 (sodium nitrate: SN) of concentration ranging from 0.02 to 0.3 M in agricultural medium. The transesterification of micro algal lipids with absolute ethanol medium in the presence of Ni/H-2 catalyst and Ni(II)-Schiff base chelate promoter was carried out to yield more algal oil. The extracted biodiesel components were analyzed cost-effectively using UV-Vis,H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and GC-MS spectral characterization to explore their biodiesel potentiality. The results revealed that the extracted microalgae biodiesels are quite suitable for biodiesel production with higher oxidation stability and cetane number. In this study, S. dimorphus and S. obliquus in the presence of five different nitrogen nutrients of concentration ranging from 0.02 to 0.3 M agar in cultural medium were observed to stimulate them to produce lipid for biodiesel generation. The transesterification of micro algal lipids with absolute ethanol medium in the presence of Ni/H-2 catalyst and Ni(II)-Schiff base chelate promoter was carried out to yield more algal oil. The fatty acid composition of the extracted micro algal oils have been identified via UV-Vis, NMR and GC-MS spectral characterization techniques to investigate their biodiesel potentiality. It is noted that increased UR concentration (up to 0.3 M) can effectively enhances biomass production of S. dimorphus and S. obliquus as increased urea levels may enhances biomass production excluding cells may have a low lipid content, at times.					manokaran, vadivel/AAA-2962-2020; KK, SivagnanaPrabhu/P-8188-2019; Kumar, Gopalakrishnan/AAX-9130-2021; Nguyen, D./Q-6703-2017; Chang, Soon/CAE-9543-2022; Shobana, Sutha/AHC-2142-2022; Dharmaraja, Jeyaprakash/G-1593-2017; Kumar, Gopalakrishnan/H-4787-2013	chang, soon woong/0000-0002-6005-1796; Dharmaraja, Jeyaprakash/0000-0002-4057-7811; , vadivel/0000-0002-2173-6960; Kumar, Gopalakrishnan/0000-0002-7848-5138; Dharmaraja, Jeyaprakash/0000-0002-6778-8176; KK, SivagnanaPrabhu/0000-0001-6406-2620													1877-2641	1877-265X				MAY	2020	11	5					1671	1679		10.1007/s12649-018-00552-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-018-00552-2													WOS:000523383800003

However, the way in which soil microbes regulate forage yield during this process remains unclear and limits our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that determine the impact of agriculture on forage yield. Here, a 4-year field experiment was conducted using three levels of planting density (high at 20 kg & BULL;hm-2, medium at 15 kg & BULL;hm-2, and low at 10 kg & BULL;hm-2) and two levels of fertilization (high at 150 kg & BULL;hm-2 P2O5 with 150 kg & BULL;hm-2 of urea and low at 75 & BULL;kg & BULL;hm-2 P2O5 with 75 kg & BULL;hm-2 of urea) in nutrient-deficient flood lands. This study aimed to survey the forage yield, soil variables, community features (including diversity, community composition, network patterns, and potential functions) of soil bacteria and fungi, and the linkages. The findings indicated that planting density and fertilization had remarkable impacts on bacterial and fungal diversity, cooccurrence network patterns, and the nitrogen-cycle-related potential of bacteria (including nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, aerobic ammonia oxidation, and nitrite respiration). The combination of medium planting density with low fertilization resulted in higher levels of forage production, bacterial Shannon diversity, N-fixation potential, and network modularity than did the other treatments. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed among bacterial diversity, network modularity, available soil nutrients, and forage production. The soil that supported a large number of bacterial taxa with co-occurring network modularity had high soil nutrient levels and forage production. Structural equation modeling and linear regression models demonstrated that the contribution of soil bacteria to forage yield was higher than that of fungi and that planting density and fertilization indirectly associated microbial function by altering bacterial diversity and network modularization, which also positive associated forage production. Therefore, there is a need to emphasize bacterial alpha-diversity and potential interaction patterns to sustain forage yields, which leads to improvements in future planting and fertilization strategies in animal husbandry ecosystems.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				DEC	2023	192								105101	10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105101		AUG 2023											WOS:001067431900001

NBB-460 exhibited high specific surface area of 876.1 m(2)/g and outstanding catalytic performance for tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) degradation. The TCH degradation efficiency reached to 94.3 % with the optimized catalytic condition (i.e., 0.2 g/L NBB-460, 3 mM PMS, 50 mg/L TCH, 25 degrees C, without pH regulation). The density functional theory calculation showed that the graphitic nitrogen and pyridinic nitrogen of NBB-460 served as active sites for peroxymonosulfate activation and TCH degradation. The quenching test, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and electrochemical measurements indicated that tetracycline hydrochloride underwent degradation via radical (O-2(center dot-)), non-radical (O-1(2)) pathways, and surface electron transfer.

There are numerous guidelines for the diagnosis and management of IEMs in the pediatric population but not for adults. Given the increasing frequency of this group of conditions in adulthood, other clinicians in addition to pediatricians should be aware of them and learn to identify their characteristic manifestations. Early recognition and implementation of an appropriate therapeutic approach would improve the clinical outcome of many of these patients. This review presents when and how to investigate a metabolic disorder with the aim of encouraging physicians not to overlook a treatable disorder.

This study aims to evaluate the nephroprotective effect against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity (GM), and thus the antioxidant activity of an aqueous extract rich in flavonoids from the aerial part of T. microphylla (APTM). The antioxidant activity of APTM was assessed using the 2-2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging test and the beta-carotene bleaching assay. The nephroprotective effect of this extract was evaluated in two doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg in GM-exposed male rats. Acute toxicity of the APTM was tested out on Swiss albino mice using 2000 mg/kg as the dose limit. The findings showed that the aqueous extract of APTM is abundant in total polyphenols and flavonoids and has significant antioxidant properties against DPPH radicals and beta-carotene oxidation. According to the acute toxicity research findings, the administered doses of the APTM extract do not cause toxicity and death. A significant increase in the serum concentrations of creatinine, urea, uric acid, sodium, chloride, calcium, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), and alkaline phosphatase, as well as an increase in urinary volume, water consumption, and relative kidney weight, were all caused by the administration of GM to rats. In addition, a significant reduction in urinary concentrations of creatinine, uric acid, urea, and albumin, and thus the clearance of creatinine and weight gain were observed in rats injected with GM. Also, the administration of GM dramatically raised the malondialdehyde level in the kidneys. Likewise, rats that had been poisoned with GM had histological kidney abnormalities. However, the daily treatment of APTM aqueous extract to rats given GM injections dramatically improved the biochemical and histological parameters affected by GM administration in rats. Finally, APTM extract enhanced GM's biochemical and histological indicators of nephrotoxicity, supporting its use as an ethnomedicinal.

J	Tao, JY; Liu, XY				Tao, Jianyu; Liu, Xiaoyuan			The effect of soil salt content and ionic composition on nitrification in a Fluvisol of the Yellow River Delta	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Soil salinization is a common cause of land degradation and a major constraint on global food production. However, the effects that different salts have on soil biogeochemical processes such as nitrification are not fully understood. An incubation experiment was conducted with two different salt treatments applied at varying concentrations (sodium chloride addition, NaCl1: 2.06, NaCl2: 4.12, NaCl3: 5.00 g kg -1; sodium sulphate addition, NaS1: 5.00, NaS2: 6.07, NaS3:12.14 g kg -1). A Fluvisol soil was used as incubation medium and urea was supplied as the nitrogen source. Results showed that urease activities were reduced (28-76%) in salt treated soils on day 1, but recovered over time and finally surpassed that of the control on day 56. Moreover, the average urease activity of Na2SO4 treatments was 1.26 times higher than that of NaCl treatments on day 56. In addition, increasing soil salinity levels simultaneously reduced hydrolysis and nitrification rates, which led to the temporary accumulation of ammonium (NH4+-N) in soils for up to 14 days. The maximum contents of NH4+-N accumulation in NaCl3 and NaS3 were 1.64 and 1.48 times higher than those of NaCl1 and NaS1, respectively. Nitrification rates were inhibited more severely in soils dominated by Cl-. Low soil salt contents (less than 7.79 g kg -1) only delayed nitrification without reducing the total amount of nitrate (NO3--N) produced during the incubation. However, high salt contents (NaS3) significantly decreased the total NO3--N production. Our results indicate that nitrite oxidation process may also limit the speed of nitrification in salt-affected soils. Additionally, a new model is introduced to better simulate the dynamics of nitrification in salt-affected soils. In conclusion, soil salt content is the primary factor that inhibits nitrification. Anions affect the inhibitory strength of salinity on nitrification in soils with similar salinity levels, where Cl- is more suppressive than SO42-.

Its internal structure was verified by solid-state nuclear magnetism (NMR) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The surface electron density on HAPA-CN was enhanced by the inclusion of oxygen and phosphorus. The boosted photocatalytic activity was attributed to the high spectral utilization of sunlight and meliorated charge separation efficiency. The experimental results showed that the 0.05 HAPA-CN/persulfate (PS) system exhibited a higher efficiency in the photodegradation process of bisphenol A (BPA) and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT). Compared with ordinary g-C3N4, the integration of photocatalysis and persulfate oxidation led to an increase in the removal of BPA and MBT pollutants, which increased by 68.11 and 11.18 times, respectively. 0.05 HAPA-CN also exhibited a certain photodegradation of BPA under long -wavelength light irradiation such as blue, green, and red light. In the photocatalytic conversion of sodium lignosulfonate (SL), the 0.05 HAPA-CN/PS system achieved a maximum yield of 134.34 mg/gSL vanillic acid at 30 min, which was significantly better than that of g-C3N4. Synergistic gas production (H2, CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6) was also significantly enhanced. Combined with theoretical calculations, the mechanism was also analyzed. This work provides new insights for exploring high efficiency photocatalyst that combine porous structure, oxygen and phosphorus co -doping and PS activation technology for removal of organic pollutants and lignin valorization.					huaming, li/S-1885-2016; Zhao, Heng/JKJ-3982-2023	Hu, Jinguang/0000-0001-8033-7102; Zhao, Heng/0009-0006-6280-3097; Gates, Ian/0000-0001-9551-6752; Jing, Liquan/0009-0008-5897-0823													1385-8947	1873-3212				FEB 15	2024	482								149090	10.1016/j.cej.2024.149090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.149090		JAN 2024											WOS:001171659500001

VPA serious adverse effects are reported to have a significant and dose-dependent incidence, many associated with VPA-induced hyper-ammonemia. This effect has been linked with reduced levels of carnitine; an endogenous compound involved in fatty acid's mitochondrial beta-oxidation by facilitation of its entrance via the carnitine shuttle. High exposure to VPA can lead to carnitine depletion causing a misbalance between the intra-mitochondrial beta-oxidation and the microsomal co-oxidation, a pathway that produces toxic metabolites such as 4-en-VPA which inhibits ammonia elimination. Moreover, a reduction in carnitine levels might be also related to VPA-induced obesity and lipids disorder. In turn, L-carnitine supplementation (CS) has been recommended and empirically used to reduce VPA's hepatotoxicity. The aim of this work was to develop a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) model to characterize VPA-induced hyperammonemia and evaluate the benefits of CS in preventing hyperammonemia under both chronic treatment and after VPA overdosing. The QSP model included a VPA population pharma-cokinetics model that allowed the prediction of total and unbound concentrations after single and multiple oral doses considering its saturable binding to plasma proteins. Predictions of time courses for 2-en-VPA, 4-en-DPA, VPA-glucuronide, carnitine, ammonia and urea levels, and for the relative change in fatty acids, Acetyl-CoA, and glutamate reflected the VPA induced changes and the efficacy of the treatment with L-carnitine. The QSP model was implemented to give a rational basis for the L-carnitine dose selection to optimize CS depending on VPA dosage regime and to assess the currently recommended L-carnitine rescue therapy after VPA overdosing. Results show that a L-carnitine dose equal to the double of the VPA dose using the same interdose interval would maintain the ammonia levels at baseline. The QSP model may be expanded in the future to describe other adverse events linked to VPA-induced changes in endogenous compounds.

Effect of alumina percentage on size and superparamagnetic properties of Ni-Al2O3 nanocomposite synthesized by solution combustion	MATERIALS & DESIGN												This paper investigates a method to achieve a close to superparamagnetic behavior in Ni-Al2O3 nanocomposite synthesized by solution combustion. The starting materials used are nickel and aluminum nitrates, as oxidizers, and urea, as fuel. Samples with 3, 10, 15, 25, 35 and 45 wt.% alumina are produced on a hot plate at 330 degrees C in air. The results show that the change in the content of Al2O3 can change the size of nickel crystallites and particles. The nickel particle size decreased by increasing the alumina content (from about 644 nm to 38 nm) and resulted in linear hysteresis loops and a relatively high magnetic saturation. The smallest mean nickel particle size measured using TEM images was larger than the critical size that indicates a typical superparamagnetic behavior. The observed linear hysteresis loops and the close to superparamagnetic behavior observed in the nanocomposite are mainly attributed to the combination of two different magnetic behaviors of ferromagnetic nickel and diamagnetic alumina.

Materials and Methods This study was conducted on 70 patients aged between 30 and 65 who were scheduled for elective laparoscopic hysterectomy. The patients were divided into two groups to receive either pre-emptive 800mg of intravenous ibuprofen plus 1000 mg of intravenous paracetamol (Group IP) or only 1000 mg of intravenous paracetamol as a control group (Group P). The blood samples for thiol/disulfide homeostasis were collected as follows: before induction of anesthesia (T0), before pneumoperitoneum (T1), following postdeflation and discontinuation of anesthesia (T2), and postoperative 24th hour (T3). Simultaneous blood samples for C-reactive protein (CRP) were also collected. The pre- and postoperative urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were measured. Results A total of 69 patients were included in the study. The patient's characteristics and intraoperative variables were comparable between groups (P > .05). The number of patients requiring rescue analgesia, the total amount of analgesic used, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, and postoperative side effects were significantly lower in Group IP (P < .001). The decrease in native and total thiol levels at T1, T2, and T3 measurement points was significant in Group IP (P < .001). In both groups, the comparison to baseline values demonstrated no significant changes in terms of disulfide level (P > .05). The simultaneous CRP levels indicated a significant increase at the postoperative 24 hour in both groups (P < .001). The difference between groups was insignificant (P > .05). There was a significant increase in urea and creatinine levels in patients of Group IP (P < .05). Conclusion The pre-emptive administration of ibuprofen provided effective pain control after gynecologic laparoscopy. However, ibuprofen changed the thiol/disulfide homeostasis in favor of oxidation and had no beneficial effect in surgically induced oxidative stress.

Electrochemical treatment of penicillin, cephalosporin, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics via active chlorine: evaluation of antimicrobial activity, toxicity, matrix, and their correlation with the degradation pathways	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Antibiotics are pharmaceuticals widely consumed and frequently detected in environmental water, where they can induce toxic effects and development of resistant bacteria. Their structural variety makes the problem of antibiotics in natural water more complex. In this work, six highly used antibiotics (at 40 mu mol L-1) belonging to three different classes (penicillins, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones) were treated using an electrochemical system with a Ti/IrO2 anode and a Zr cathode in the presence of NaCl (0.05 mu mol L-1). The attack of electrogenerated active chlorine was found to be the main degradation route. After only 20 min of treatment, the process decreased more than 90% of the initial concentration of antibiotics, following the degradation order: fluoroquinolones > penicillins > cephalosporins. The primary interactions of the degrading agent with fluoroquinolones occurred at the cyclic amine (i.e., piperazyl ring) and the benzene ring. Meanwhile, the cephalosporins and penicillins were initially attacked on the beta-lactam and sulfide groups. However, the tested penicillins presented an additional reaction on the central amide. In all cases, the transformations of antibiotics led to the antimicrobial activity decreasing. On the contrary, the toxicity level showed diverse results: increasing, decreasing, and no change, depending on the antibiotic type. In fact, due to the conservation of quinolone nucleus in the fluoroquinolone by-products, the toxicity of the treated solutions remained unchanged. With penicillins, the production of chloro-phenyl-isoxazole fragments increased the toxicity level of the resultant solution. However, the opening of beta-lactam ring of cephalosporin antibiotics decreased the toxicity level of the treated solutions. Finally, the application of the treatment to synthetic hospital wastewater and seawater containing a representative antibiotic showed that the high amount of chloride ions in seawater accelerates the pollutant degradation. In contrast, the urea and ammonium presence in the hospital wastewater retarded the removal of this pharmaceutical.

In this work, copper pyrovanadate (Cu2V2O7) was obtained by combustion synthesis, and the influence of different fuels such as citric acid, glycine, and urea on the properties of this semiconductor was evaluated. Using X-ray diffraction analysis, it was observed that the beta-Cu(2)V(2)O(7)phase was formed in greater proportions for the three samples, especially with the use of urea. On the other hand, the formation of the alpha-Cu(2)V(2)O(7)phase was not verified when glycine was used, which can be associated with the occurrence of a higher flame temperature during the combustion step (1507 degrees C). Among the photoelectrodes obtained, the ITO/Cu2V2O7-Urea presented the best photoelectrocatalytic performance, with a greater discoloration rate constant of methylene blue dye (k(obs) = 28.61 x 10(-3) min(-1)) and less charge transfer resistance (42.75 omega), while in the other photoelectrodes, the proportion of the beta-Cu(2)V(2)O(7)phase was lower, as well as the discoloration rate constant. Thus, this work has contributed to demonstrate how the choice of fuel can influence the formation of the alpha- and beta-phases of Cu(2)V(2)O(7)and, therefore, may promote the development of materials with greater stability and photoelectrocatalytic efficiency.

For the system to comply with future exhaust regulations, a DPF was installed, and an electrical heated catalyst (EHC) device was installed to manage exhaust gas temperature. The emission characteristics of exhaust gas were examined according to the power and applied duration of EHC, and the effects of catalyst coating and the urea water solution (UWS) injection map on NOx reduction, NH3 slip, and N2O emissions in NRTC mode were investigated. The application of a 4 kW class EHC system enables the lowering of the injection starting temperature of the UWS, as reliable gas heating (heating duration control) is guaranteed. When the injection starting temperature (based on the SCR inlet temperature) was set to 150 & DEG;C, NSR map, (III) in conjunction with the operation of the EHC, effectively achieved significant NOx reduction in NRTC mode without deposit and wetting occurring in the mixer and exhaust pipe. Regarding changes in EHC power from 3 kW to 4 kW, it was observed that a NOx reduction of 0.05 g/kWh occurs in the cold NRTC mode, but in the hot NRTC mode, it was found that the relative decrease in the UWS is due to the increased NO2 conversion efficiency as a result of the oxidation catalyst, making 3 kW more advantageous. Furthermore, due to the increase in NO2 concentration caused by the oxidation catalyst and the increase in the low-temperature injected UWS, NH4NO3 was formed, which resulted in an increase in PM emissions and a significant increase in N2O emissions around an exhaust temperature of 250 & DEG;C. When the EHC power was set to 3 kW and the volume of oxidation catalyst and the amount of UWS injection were adjusted, applying EHC in the NRTC mode resulted in an additional NOx reduction of 58.6% and 88.4% in cold and hot modes, respectively, compared with not using EHC, with a fuel penalty of approximately 1.67%, while limiting the peak concentrations of N2O and NH3.

In particular, theoretical work predicts TMNs as promising electrocatalysts towards the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). However, recent experimental studies under realistic conditions, have shown the release of lattice nitride to ammonia in a noncatalytic process, suggesting inherent instability of these materials. TMNs stability can be increased by the incorporation of a second metal in the lattice, to form bimetallic systems. Herein, we present a robust approach to prepare nonprecious transition multi-metallic nitride nano-catalysts, followed by a comprehensive study on their stability. The stability of the as-prepared catalysts was tested in electrolytes relevant for electrocatalysis, showing a higher chemical resistance of the bimetallic catalysts over the monometallic ones. This study suggests a novel approach to matching electrolyte pH and catalyst to ensure chemical stability in the electrochemical environment.

Three new areas that address novel pathophysiological mechanisms and/or therapeutic approaches toward cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease patients include the use of an anti-inflammatory agent, the role of catalytic iron, and protein carbamylation. In preliminary studies, hydroxychloroquine, which has multiple anti-inflammatory properties, preserved vascular compliance for the aorta and major vessels, as well as reduced the extent of severity of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. The ability of iron to rapidly and reversibly cycle between 2 oxidation states makes iron potentially hazardous by enabling it to participate in the generation of powerful oxidant species. We have shown that high catalytic iron in the general population is associated with a 4-fold increase in prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), even after accounting for traditional risk factors. In addition, the highest levels of catalytic iron are present in dialysis patients and, more specifically, patients with prevalent CVD have several-fold higher catalytic iron levels compared with controls without CVD. These data suggest the utility of iron chelators for preventing and treating CVD in patients with chronic kidney disease and should be further investigated. Carbamylation of proteins results from nonenzymatic chemical modification by isocyanic acid derived from urea and an alternative route, the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate. We have shown carbamylated low-density lipoprotein to have all the major biological effects relevant to atherosclerosis including endothelial cell injury, increased expression of cell adhesion molecules, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. In 2 separate clinical studies, plasma levels of carbamylated protein independently predicted an increased risk of CVD and death.

Calcium fructoborate (CFB) is a boron-based nutritional supplement with antioxidant properties. Calcium fructoborate used in our study is marketed by Future Ceutical Corporation as FruiteX-B, which has a chemical structure similar to the natural form of boron found in edible plants. In this study, it was aimed to determine the antioxidant activity, DNA damage, and histopathological effects of CFB on the liver and kidney tissues of rats in the toxicity induced by CCL4. During 14 days of treatment, 42 wistar albino rats were divided into 7 in each group, control group, olive oil (0.25 ml twice a week), CFB (1 mg/day), CFB-CCL4 (1 mg/day, twice a week 0.5 ml), ZY-CFB (0.25 ml/twice a week, 1 mg/2 times day twice), and CCl4 (0.5 ml twice a week). AST, ALT, HDL, LDH, urea, creatinine, triglyceride, total protein and albumin levels were analyzed in the blood serum of rats. The antioxidant defense system enzymes CAT, GR, GPx, SOD activities and GSH, MDA and 8-OHdG levels in liver and kidney tissues were determined and evaluated. In addition, liver and kidney tissues were examined with only hispatological tests. As a result of the findings, it shows that CCl4 disrupts antioxidant defense mechanisms by disrupting some enzyme systems in the kidney and liver. CFB (Fruit-XB), a boronbased dietary supplement, regulates antioxidant metabolism by strengthening biochemical metabolic profiles against oxidation, and also has a protective effect against DNA damage caused by oxidation. Thus, it was concluded that CFB has antioxidant property against CCl4-induced liver and kidney toxicity.

Studies have mainly focused on the effects of inorganic N enrichment, whereas little is known about the effects of organic N input on soil gross N transformation and the underlying microbial mechanisms. Here we conducted a laboratory N-15 tracing study in a temperate needle-broadleaved mixed forest with a fertilization rate of 0, 20, 60, and 120 kg urea-N ha(-1) yr(-1) over three years. We investigated the key drivers of soil N transformation processes using a 15 N tracing model in the context of selected soil chemical properties and microbial characteristics. Urea addition did not change soil gross N mineralization rates, while stimulating mineralization of labile organic N (M-Nlab). Urea addition at a rate of 120 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) significantly increased autotrophic nitrification and gross nitrification rates by 88% and 96%, respectively. In contrast, all the three levels of urea addition significantly reduced gross microbial N immobilization by 28% to 52%, leading to an increase in the accumulation of soil NO3--N in the top 10 cm soil layer by 38% to 88%. The changes in autotrophic nitrification were primarily driven by acid-tolerant ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Fungi were responsible for the change in heterotrophic nitrification under organic N enrichment. Gross N transformation rates were predominately regulated by AOA and fungal abundances as well as soil NO3--N content under high level of organic N addition. The response of soil N transformation to exogenous organic N input depended on N addition level with the threshold rate being estimated to be 60-120 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) . All lines of evidence showed that the temperate needle-broadleaved mixed forest is moving towards an opener microbial N cycle under elevated organic N deposition. Our finding suggests that the effect of organic N input on soil gross N transformation is different from that of inorganic N input, which should be considered in ecosystem process models.					hua, fang/B-3590-2009; Müller, Christoph/F-9521-2010														0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 1	2021	385								114886	10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114886	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114886													WOS:000609999200035

As such, we carried out a nitrification inhibition experiment on acidic paddy soils at a pH of 5.0, 5.3, and 5.4 to investigate the effects of 1-octyne and PTIO on nitrate (NO3-) formation, ammonia (NH3)-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), comammox Nitrospira, and nitrite (NO2-)-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) under urea fertilized- and unfertilized-conditions. We observed that 1-Octyne stimulated the growth of comammox Nitrospira clades A and B, and Nitrobacter-like-like NOB and Nitrospira-like-like NOB without inhibiting AOB growth. This observation indicates that 1-Octyne has the potential to promote comammox process and NO2- oxidization, and its usage may lead to an underestimation of AOB activity. Unexpectedly, we found that PTIO was incapable of causing a rapid inhibition of AOA growth and NO3- formation. In the short term, PTIO was usually not detrimental to the growth of comammox Nitrospira clades A and B, AOB, and Nitrobacter-like-like NOB. Instead, increased growth of AOB and Nitrospira-like-like NOB were observed following its application. Likely due to increased bacterial nitrification and NO2- oxidation and the reaction of PTIO with nitric oxide (NO) produced by non-nitrification processes, increased NO3- formation with PTIO was observable in acidic soils with varying N statuses. These findings highlight the need to develop novel and more efficient inhibition strategies to actualize rate distinction among AOA, AOB, comammox Nitrospira in acidic soils.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				NOV	2024	203								105673	10.1016/j.apsoil.2024.105673	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2024.105673		OCT 2024											WOS:001331434500001

During the preparation of the Fe-NC catalyst, the complexation of N elements in urea could anchor Fe, and the formation of C3N4 during urea pyrolysis could also prevent migration and aggregation of Fe species, which jointly improve the dispersion and stability of Fe. The FeN4 sites and highly dispersed Fe nanoparticles synergistically trigger the dual-site peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for highly efficient m-cresol degradation, while the ordered mesoporous structure of the catalyst could improve the mass transfer rate of the catalytic process, which together promote catalytic degradation of m-cresol by PMS activation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) analytic experiments demonstrate that the system degrades m-cresol by free radical path-way mainly based on SO -4 center dot and center dot OH, and partially based on center dot OH as the active components, and a possible PMS activation mechanism by 5Fe-50 for m-cresol degradation was proposed. This study can provide theoretical guidance for the preparation of efficient and stable catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants by activated PMS.

First, the experiment in vitro was carried out to investigate the effects of culturing porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line with pyruvate on the oxidation. Then, barrows weighing 40 kg were used in the experiment investigating the changes of nitrogen balance in response to addition of pyruvate to low-protein diets. Last, barrows (40 kg), which were surgically fitted with permanent catheters in the mesenteric vein, portal vein, hepatic vein, and carotid artery, were used to investigate the effects of supplementing low-protein diets with calcium pyruvate on the net portal fluxes of amino acids (AAs) and the consumption of AAs in the liver. The results showed that culturing cells with sodium pyruvate significantly reduced the number of glutamate oxidation (P < 0.05). Addition of calcium pyruvate to low-protein diets significantly reduced urinary nitrogen excretion from 13.2 g/d (18.0% crude protein, CP) to 10.3 g/d (15.0% CP) or 7.80 g/d (13.5% CP) and total nitrogen excretion from 22.5 g/d (18.0% CP) to 17.8 g/d (15.0% CP) or 14.2 g/d (13.5% CP) (P < 0.05), without obviously negative effects on the nitrogen retention (P > 0.05). Addition of calcium pyruvate to low-protein diets significantly decreased essential AA consumption rate in the liver (P < 0.05). This diet modification reduced the net portal fluxes of NH3, glycine, and alanine, as well as urea production rate in the liver (P < 0.05). The results indicated that pyruvate is an effective substitute for glutamate as a supplement in low-protein diets, reducing porcine nitrogen excretion and nitrogen consumption.

J	Ma, L; Shan, J; Yan, XY				Ma, Lan; Shan, Jun; Yan, Xiaoyuan			Nitrite behavior accounts for the nitrous oxide peaks following fertilization in a fluvo-aquic soil	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												It has been widely demonstrated-both in the field and the laboratory-that N fertilization stimulates peaks in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in agricultural soils. However, the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain unclear. In this study, three aerobic incubation experiments were designed to: (1) evaluate the effects of urea and nitrification inhibitors (NIs) on inorganic N concentrations and N2O emissions; (2) establish the relationship between nitrite concentration and N2O emission by adding different amounts of nitrite to soil, and identify the contributions of abiotic processes to N2O production from nitrite by sterilization; and (3) explore the underlying reasons for nitrite accumulation by using N-15 tracer methods. Compared with NI treatments, substantial nitrite accumulated in the UREA treatment, mainly attributed to the inhibitory effects of high ammonium from urea hydrolysis on transformation of N-15-nitrite to N-15-nitrate. N2O emission from soil was related to soil nitrite concentration, according to the Michaelis-Menten relationship (R (2) = 0.998; P < 0.01). No significant N2O emission was observed in sterilized soil, indicating that N2O production was a microbial process with the probable dominance of nitrifier denitrification (ND). In conclusion, our results suggest that ammonium fertilizer stimulates nitrite accumulation by inhibiting nitrite transformation to nitrate, thus resulting in an increase in N2O emissions, while NIs reduce N2O emissions by suppressing nitrite formation.					yan, xiao yuan/M-9840-2016; Shan, Jun/G-2949-2011	yan, xiao yuan/0000-0001-8645-4836; Shan, Jun/0000-0002-0276-4456													0178-2762	1432-0789				JUL	2015	51	5					563	572		10.1007/s00374-015-1001-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-015-1001-8													WOS:000355865200005

Strong peroxidase (PRX) and oxidoreductase activities were observed in the barley root tips that were markedly inhibited by NaN3. Rapid and strong nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) reduction is associated mainly with the vital functions of root cells but not with superoxide formation. In turn, the inhibition of root surface redox activity by NaN3 strongly reduced the formation of formazan, but its slight accumulation, observed in the root elongation zone, was a result of NADPH oxidase-mediated apoplastic superoxide formation. A longer staining time period with NBT was required for the detection of antimycin A-mediated superoxide formation inside the cells. This antimycin A-induced superoxide was clearly detectable by hydroethidine (HE) after the inhibition of PRXs by NaN3, and it was restricted into the root transition zone. TEMPOL, a superoxide scavenger, strongly inhibited both NBT reduction and HE oxidation in the presence of NaN3. Similarly, the DCDHF-DA and DHR123 oxidation was markedly reduced after the inhibition of apoplastic PRXs by NaN3 and was detectable mainly in the root transition zone. This fluorescence signal was not influenced by the application of pyruvate but was strongly reduced by urea, a peroxynitrite scavenger. The presented results suggest that if the root PRXs and oxidoreductases are inhibited, both NBT and HE detect mainly superoxide, whereas both DCDHF-DA and DHR123 may be efficiently used for the detection of peroxynitrite in intact barley root tips. The inhibition of PRXs and oxidoreductases is crucial for avoiding false-positive reactions in the localization of reactive oxygen species in the intact barley root tip.

Modern high-yielding dairy cows experience severe metabolic stress during the transition period between late gestation and early lactation to meet the high energy and nutrient requirements of the fetus or the mammary gland, and additional thermal stress during this time has adverse implications on metabolism and welfare. The mechanisms enabling metabolic adaptation to heat apart from the decline in feed intake and milk yield are not fully elucidated yet. To distinguish between feed intake and heat stress related effects, German Holstein dairy cows were first kept at thermoneutral conditions at 15 degrees C followed by exposure to heat-stressed (HS) at 28 degrees C or pair-feeding (PF) at 15 degrees C for 6 days; in late-pregnancy and again in early lactation. Liver and muscle biopsies and plasma samples were taken to assess major metabolic pathway regulation using real-time PCR and Western Blot. The results indicate that during heat stress, late pregnant cows activate Cahill but reduce Cori cycling, prevent increase in skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, and utilize increased amounts of pyruvate for gluconeogenesis, without altering urea-genesis despite reduced plane of nutrition. These homeorhetic adaptations are employed to reduce endogenous heat production while diverting amino acids to the growing fetus. Metabolic adaptation to heat stress in early lactation involves increased long-chain fatty acid degradation in muscle peroxisomes, allowance for muscle glucose utilization but diminished hepatic use of amino acid-derived pyruvate for gluconeogenesis and reduced peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and ATP production in liver of HS compared to PF cows in early lactation. Consequently, metabolic adaptation to heat stress and reduced feed intake differ between late pregnancy and early lactation of dairy cows to maintain energy supply for fetus development or milk production simultaneously reducing endogenous heat production.

Methods: Celecoxib and ibuprofen (both at 25 mg/Kg) were orally administered for 12 days, beginning on the same day when the rats were inoculated with Walker-256 tumor cells. Results: Celecoxib and ibuprofen treatment reversed the reduced production of glucose, pyruvate, lactate and urea from alanine as well as the reduced production of glucose from pyruvate and lactate in perfused liver from tumor-bearing rats. Besides, celecoxib and ibuprofen treatment restored the decreased ATP content, increased triacylglycerol levels and reduced mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1), while ibuprofen treatment restored the reduced mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) in the liver of tumor-bearing rats. Both treatments tended to decrease TNF alpha, IL6 and IL10 in the liver of tumor-bearing rats. Finally, the treatment with celecoxib, but not with ibuprofen, reduced the growth of Walker-256 tumor. Conclusion: Celecoxib and ibuprofen restored the decreased gluconeogenesis in the liver of Walker-256 tumor-bearing rats. These effects did not involve changes in tumor growth and probably occurred by anti-inflammatory properties of these NSAIDs, which increased expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation (PPARa and CPT1) and consequently the ATP production, normalizing the energy status in the liver of tumor-bearing rats.

The current study was conducted to investigate how ambient ammonia exposure influences lipid metabolism in the pig model. Twelve pigs were randomly divided into two groups, either exposed to 0 or 35 mg/m(3) atmospheric ammonia for 25 days. Serum ammonia remained unchanged (p > 0.05), but increased serum urea concentration was found (p < 0.05) after ammonia exposure. Ammonia exposure also caused an increased C18:0, C18:2n6c, C18:3n6, C18:3n3, C20:0, C20:2, C20:3n6, C20:3n3, C22:0 concentrations and fat content in the longissimus dorsi muscle (p < 0.05), and also serum total triglyceride (p - 0.0294) and ApoB (p = 0.0061) contents. Analysis of serum free amino acids profile revealed that concentrations of omithine, tyrosine, asparagine, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamine and valine were significantly increased in the pigs exposed to 35 mg/m(3) ammonia (p < 0.05). RNA-Seq analysis showed that genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid synthesis (FASN, SCD and FADS1) and uptake (LDLR) were up-regulated, whereas genes related to lipolysis (PNPLA4, ANGPTL4 and CEL), transport (CPT1A, CPTIB and CPT2) and beta-oxidation (ACADL, ACADVL, UCP2 and UCP3) were down-regulated. Furthermore, exposure to 35 mg/m(3) atmospheric ammonia increased expression of mTOR (p = 0.0377) and its downstream P70S6K (p = 0.0139) and p-P70S6K (p = 0.0431), but decreased AMPK (p < 0.0001) and p-AMPK (p = 0.0071) in the longissimus dorsi muscle. In conclusion, high concentration of atmospheric ammonia exposure greatly interferes with amino add metabolism, resulting in increased BCAAs and aromatic amino adds. The increased BCAAs production can up-regulate lipid synthesis and down-regulate beta-oxidation by activating mTOR signaling and inhibiting AMPK signaling. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Kiran			Directly grown of 3D-nickel oxide nano flowers on TiO2 nanowire arrays by hydrothermal route for electrochemical determination of naringenin flavonoid in vegetable samples	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												A novel an electrochemical sensor is constructed based on three-dimensional Nickel oxide nano flowers (3D-NiO) and TiO2-nanowire arrays (TiO(2)NWA) by hydrothermal route. Initially TiO2-NWA were produced on titanium foil using hydrothermal method in the presence of 1.0 M NaOH solution at 180 degrees C for 20 h, then 3D-nickel oxide nano (NiO) flowers (up to 3 mu M) are directly grown on TiO2 NWA using hydrothermal reaction in the presence of glucose, urea and nickel acetate mixer solution at 150 degrees C for 5 h, followed by N-2 gas assisted annealing at 500 degrees C for 2 h. The resultant nanostructures are characterized by CV, XRD, FESEM-EDX and TEM. The as prepared electrodes are used as electrochemical sensors for investigating electrochemical behavior of naringenin (NRG) flavonoid. Further differential pulse voltammetry is used to determine the NRG in vegetable (tomato and ginger) samples at optimized conditions, such as accumulation potential, time, the applied sample volume, pH of the buffer and the step potential. The finest oxidation peaks are observed for NRG in acidic condition (phosphate buffer solution) at around 0.35 V. The obtained oxidation peaks were observed at low current values over the concentration of 1.50 x 10(-8) M to 2.35 x 10(-4) M with lower detection limit of 0.025 nM for NRG. Mainly the presence of carbon (glucose) enhanced the conductivity and surface area of the as prepared electrode (NiO/TiO(2)NWA). The nano composite modified electrode (NiO/TiO(2)NWA) displays good stability, high sensitivity and reproducibility. The recommended method is effectively applied an economical and simple sensor for the present investigation. (C) 2018 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

The effect of postheating at different temperatures on the structure, molecular, microstructure, and chromatic properties of powders and tiles colored by in-glaze powders was studied. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed that as-synthesized powders were obtained in crystalline FeCr2O4 phases moreover, postheating of the powders led to d-space shift and oxidation and formation of (Fe,Cr)(2)O-3 solid solution phase regardless of fuel type. Phase transformation of FeCr2O4 to (Fe,Cr)(2)O-3 solid solution was observed at 500/750 degrees C depending on the dominant phase of as-synthesized particles. Fourier transform infrared analysis illustrated that the band positions of octahedral M-O and tetrahedral M-O bonds were shifted due to Fe cations movement from their position and lattice shrinkage by increasing of post-heating temperature. Moreover, scanning electron micrographs showed that Fe0.7Cr1.3O3 semispherical fine particles were formed from porous spongy FeCr2O4 particles due to oxidation and phase transformation during the postheating. Furthermore, chromatic properties of the samples were represented. The color properties of the pigments showed that the formation of brown pigments is provided with the phase transformation from FeCr2O4 to (Fe,Cr)(2)O-3 at a temperature of up to 750 degrees C. Moreover, increasing the color purity to this temperature is related to the removal of residual carbonaceous matters. The chromatic properties of the glazed tiles colored using the pigments showed that postheating between 250 and 500 degrees C led to more brown appearance.

Facile Approach To Synthesize Nitrogen- and Oxygen-Rich Carbon Quantum Dots for pH Sensor, Fluorescent Indicator, and Invisible Ink Applications	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING												Although few works on highly luminescent carbon quantum dots (CQD) with high photostability for sensing applications have already been reported in the literature, the study of photoluminescence of CQD in the presence of oxidation-reduction reaction and its use as fluorescent indicator for redox titration still remains in an infant stage. Here, we have synthesized green, eco-friendly, highly luminescent multicolored emissive CQDs from aspartic acid and urea using simple heat treatment at 200 degrees C for 2 h without using a solvent. The as-synthesized CQDs show dual emission peaks at shorter excitation (300 nm) wavelength, one due to quantum dots and the other due to defect states; however, at longer excitation (400 nm) wavelength, it shows only one peak due to defect states. At shorter excitation wavelength, the green emission peak is red-shifted as well as quantum yield increases from 38.81 to 57.68% with the increasing nitrogen content. These CQDs are very pH sensitive and it changes from blue to green color with the increasing pH from 1 to 13. We have used these highly photostable CQDs as a fluorescence indicator to study oxidation-reduction titration reaction and detect Fe2+, Cr3+ by fluorescence on-off-on technique. Although Fe2+, Cr3+ ions have no direct PL quenching effect, it is possible to detect due to different redox reactions occurring in solutions. We have estimated accurately the amounts of Fe2+ and Cr3+ present in the solutions using fluorescence titration results. Because of high photostability and high quantum yield these carbon dots are also useful as a unique invisible ink in paper and polymer film substrate in which written article changes color at different excitations for security reasons.

Methods: Twenty-four Dorper lambs (18.68 +/- 0.6 kg, 4 to 5 months old) were randomly assigned to a concentrate mixture containing either, no supplement (control, T1), 1% Rosmarinus officinalis leaves (T2), 1% Nigella sativa seeds (T3), or 1% Rosmarinus officinalis leaves+1% Nigella sativa seeds (T4) on a dry matter basis. The lambs were fed the treatments with urea-treated rice straw for 90 days, slaughtered and the muscles were subjected to a 7 d postmortem chill storage. Results: The T2 lambs had greater (p<0.05) slaughter and cold carcass weights than the con-trol lambs. Dietary supplements did not affect (p>0.05) chill loss, dressing percentage, carcass composition, intramuscular fat and muscle pH in Dorper lambs. Meat from supplemented lambs had lower (p<0.05) cooking and drip losses, shear force, lightness, and lipid oxidation and greater (p<0.05) redness compared with the control meat. The impact of dietary supplements on muscle FA varied with muscle type. Diet had no effect (p>0.05) on the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase and lipoprotein lipase genes in LD and ST muscles in Dorper lambs. The T2 and T3 diets up regulated the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 2 gene in LD and ST muscles and up regulated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 in ST muscle in Dorper lambs. Conclusion: Dietary supplementation of Nigella sativa seeds and Rosmarinus officinalis leaves had beneficial effects on meat quality in Dorper lambs.

Critical assessment of selenourea as an efficient small molecule fluorescence quenching probe to monitor protein dynamics	CHEMICAL SCIENCE												Organoselenium compounds have recently been the experimentalists' delight due to their broad applications in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. Selenium atom replacement of the carbonyl oxygen of the urea moiety dramatically reduces the HOMO-LUMO gap and oxidation potential, which completely changes the physicochemical properties of selenocarbonyl compounds. To our surprise, the photophysics and utility of a simple molecule such as selenourea (SeU) have not been explored in detail, which persuaded us to investigate its role in excited state processes. The steady-state emission, temperature-dependent time-correlated single photon counting, and femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experimental results confirmed that SeU significantly enhances the fluorescence quenching through a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism with an similar to 10 ps ultrafast intrinsic PET lifetime component which is mostly absent in thiourea (TU). A wide range of fluorophores, based on their different redox abilities and fluorescence lifetimes covering a broad spectral window (lambda ex: 390-590 nm and lambda em: 490-690 nm), were chosen to validate the proof of the concept. It was extended to tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-5-maleimide labeled lysozyme protein, where we observed significant fluorescence quenching in the presence of SeU. The present work emphasizes that the high quenching efficiency with an ultrafast PET process, reduced orbital energy gap, and higher negative free energy change of the electron transfer reaction are the representative characteristics of selenourea or selenoamides to enable them as potential surrogates of thioamides or oxoamides quenching probes to monitor protein conformational changes and dynamics. This work unravels that reduced Delta E and higher -ve Delta G of the electron transfer reaction are crucial for an ultrafast intrinsic photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process that enables selenourea (SeU) as an efficient fluorescence quenching probe.

Designing a 3D nanoporous network via self-assembly of WO3 nanorods for improved electrocapacitive performance	CRYSTENGCOMM												This work presents the first report on effective utilization of protonated urea as a novel nanostructure directing agent, under controlled conditions of pH, calcination temperature and time, to design 3D WO3 nanoporous networks using self-assembly of WO3 nanorods. The synthesized nanostructures are characterized for their phase purity, shape, size and morphology using various surface characterization techniques. The effect of nanostructure design and dimensionality on improved electrocapacitive performance is investigated by measuring the H+ intercalation efficiency using cyclic voltammetry. The highest H+ diffusion coefficient of 1.3 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) and specific capacitance of 148 F g(-1) are measured for 3D WO3 nanoporous structures. The improved electrocapacitive performance is attributed to the 3D surface heterostructure and the presence of well aligned porous channels, which together provide facile diffusion of H+ ions and a greater electroactive surface area. The simplicity and flexibility of the synthesis method to produce multidimensional WO3 nanostructures of improved electrocapacitive performance demonstrate promising results for device scale applications.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) prepared by the conventional co-precipitation method, with a less active site density and a poor electrical transport, are often used as precursors for further preparation of PBA derivatives, such as metal oxides, metal alloys, metal phosphides, and so on, due to their poor OER activity. In this report, controllable synthesis of NiFe PBA with Fe2O3 byproducts on a Ni foam substrate was achieved through a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction by adjusting the amount of urea and potassium ferricyanide. After chemical etching and electrochemical activation, NiFe PBA was entirely transformed into amorphous superhydrophilic NiFe PBA (denoted a-NiHCF), which exhibited a remarkable OER performance at a large current density. To drive high current densities of 400 and 800 mA cm(-2), only ultralow overpotentials of 280 and 309 mV were required, respectively, which far exceed many recently reported OER catalysts. The superior performance can be attributed to the following: (1) in situ growth on a metal foam substrate can improve the structural stability and provide a faster charge transfer as well as oxygen bubble release; (2) chemical etching allows exposing more surface active sites; (3) an electrochemical activation-induced amorphous surface possesses a larger Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, more high-valent oxidation states, and higher intrinsic OER activity; and (4) the superhydrophilic surface structure is conducive to the adsorption of water molecules. These advantages make a-NiHCF a promising candidate for application in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting.

Fagonia indica ameliorates chromium-induced nephrotoxicity: Role of antioxidant activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines in in-vivo renoprotection	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL & OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH												Chromium (Cr) is an environmental pollutant, has high redox potential, and can exist in various oxidation states, possibly leading to nephrotoxicity. As a potential treatment option, Fagonia indica (F. indica) is an herb remedy traditionally used as a phytomedicine to cure ailments. However, efficient validation of its protective effect and molecular mechanisms has not yet been established. As such, this study aims to investigate the protective effect of F. indica against Cr-induced nephrotoxicity in Swiss mice. Mice were divided into five groups: group I (negative control), group II (F. indica), group III (potassium dichromate [PDC]-treated), group IV (PDC + saline), and group V (PDC + F. indica). Our results demonstrate that group III exhibited decreases in superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione s-transferases (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX) levels. Meanwhile, protein carbonyl (PCO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased in kidney homogenates, increasing the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). This was followed by elevated NF-kappa B, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine serum levels in group III compared with group I. Moreover, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated severe damage to the renal tubular epithelial cells, as well as marked congestion and expressions of caspase-3 and NF-kappa B. Further, group V showed an improvement in antioxidant activity parameters and reductions in the IL-6, caspase-3, and NF-kappa B expressions, followed by significant decreases in NF-kappa B, BUN, and creatinine serum levels. Furthermore, fewer histopathological disturbances were observed compared with untreated group III. Such alterations may be attributed to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of F. indica. Therefore, our exploration reveals that F. indica is effective in protecting against Cr-induced nephrotoxicity, and it could be applied in the future to human kidney diseases caused by environmental pollutants.

Application of urease inhibitors (UIs) or nitrification inhibitors (NIs) can mitigate these losses to some extent but not completely. A preliminary study showed that 2-Cyclopenten-1-one (CCO), an organic compound derived from chamomile (Chamomila recutita L.) can inhibit soil urease activity and also nitrification and therefore has the potential to act as a dual-function inhibitor for decreasing fertilizer-induced N losses and increasing N use efficiency. In this study, a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of CCO on N transformations and NH3, N2O and CH4 emissions from soil, and monitor changes in the ammonia oxidizer amoA gene abundance. Three replicates of five fertilized treatments were included: Urea (fertilizer only), thiophos-phoric triamide (NBPT) (a urease inhibitor), dicyandiamide (DCD) (a widely used synthetic nitrification inhib-itor), NBPT combined with DCD, and CCO, along with an unfertilized control.The results indicated that, the ability of CCO to reduce N losses and improve maize yield was potentially superior to DCD, NBPT, or the combination of DCD and NBPT. Compared with the urea treatment, the addition of CCO significantly reduced urease activity and nitrification, which subsequently increased the content of NH4+-N and decreased the content of NO3--N in the soil during the maize growth period. Moreover, the cumulative NH3 and N2O emissions, global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of the maize field were lowest from the CCO applied plots during the growth season, decreasing by 32.5 %, 21.94 %, 7.69 % and 20.92 %, respectively, compared to urea treatment. Notably, CCO application significantly reduced the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria in soil. These results suggest that CCO is effective for suppressing urease activity and the nitrification rate in soil and has the potential to be a novel naturally sourced dual-purpose inhibitor.

In this study, acetylene (0.01%v/v C2H2) and 1-octyne (0.01%v/v) were used to assess the relative contribution of AOB and AOA to N2O emission from paddy soils with different soil pH and N fertilizers application by incubation in microcosms. The results indicated that cumulative N2O emissions from the alkaline paddy soil were significantly higher than those from the acidic paddy soil, and urea-N application promoted more N2O emissions than ammonium-N application. The total relative contribution of AOA and AOB exceeded 60%, so autotrophic nitrification was the main N2O emission process in both soils at 80% water holding capacity (WHC); after N application, their total contribution increased. The relative contribution of 1-octyne-sensitive AOB (> 45%) to N2O emissions was significantly higher than that of AOA (< 15%) in both tested soils without N application, and its contribution decreased after ammonium-N application in both soils and urea-N application in alkaline soil. The promoting effects of urea-N on N2O yields of AOB were greater than those by ammonium-N; on the contrary, the N2O yields of AOA were more sensitive to ammonium-N application. The main species of nitrifers, Nitrosospira-AOB, Nitrosovibrio-AOB, and Nitrososphaera-AOA, were involved in N2O emissions in both soils.

SiOC ceramics synthesized at 1200 C-o exhibits good chemical durability in HF solution due to the formation of more SiO2C2 unit. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature not only increases the specific surface area and pore volume of SiOC derived materials, but also generates more pyridinic N and pyrrolic N functionalities. Furthermore, after HF etching, only incorporation of fluorine in SiOC ceramics (F - Si bond) and no C - F bond is found. The phase separation occurs during the pyrolysis process, and the generation of SiC is mainly caused by the carbothermal reduction reaction between SiO2 and free C (C-free). The thermogravimetric analysis shows the oxidation resistance of SiC is superior to that of SiOC and C, while SiOC has better thermal stability than C. Both the high specific surface area, micropore volume and N-doping contribute the good supercapacitor performance. SiOC derived carbon materials with a high specific surface area of 1109.0 m(2)g(- 1) and pore volume of 0.77 cm(3)g(- 1) exhibit the specific capacitance of 272.2 Fg(- 1) at the current density of 0.2 Ag- 1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte and good cycling stability of 89.7% retention after 10,000 cycles at 5 Ag- 1.

Recently, "-omics" approached have enlightened our knowledge of tumor biology. Such approaches have been extensively implemented in order to provide biomarkers for monitoring of the disease as well as to improve readouts of therapeutic impact. The application of metabolomics to the study of cancer is especially beneficial, since it reflects the biochemical consequences of many cancer type-specific pathophysiological processes. Here, we characterize metabolic profiles of colon and ovarian cancer cell lines to provide broader insight into differentiating metabolic processes for prospective drug development and clinical screening. Methods: We applied non-targeted metabolomics-based mass spectroscopy combined with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography for the metabolic phenotyping of four cancer cell lines: two from colon cancer (HCT15, HCT116) and two from ovarian cancer (OVCAR3, SKOV3). We used the MetaP server for statistical data analysis. Results: A total of 225 metabolites were detected in all four cell lines; 67 of these molecules significantly discriminated colon cancer from ovarian cancer cells. Metabolic signatures revealed in our study suggest elevated tricarboxylic acid cycle and lipid metabolism in ovarian cancer cell lines, as well as increased beta-oxidation and urea cycle metabolism in colon cancer cell lines. Conclusions: Our study provides a panel of distinct metabolic fingerprints between colon and ovarian cancer cell lines. These may serve as potential drug targets, and now can be evaluated further in primary cells, biofluids, and tissue samples for biomarker purposes.

J	Masaya, TW; Goulay, F				Masaya, Tadini Wenyika; Goulay, Fabien			A Molecular Dynamic Study of the Effects of Surface Partitioning on the OH Radical Interactions with Solutes in Multicomponent Aqueous Aerosols	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A												The surface-bulk partitioning of small saccharide and amide molecules in aqueous droplets was investigated using molecular dynamics. The air-particle interface was modeled using a 80 & ANGS; cubic water box containing a series of organic molecules and surrounded by gaseous OH radicals. The properties of the organic solutes within the interface and the water bulk were examined at a molecular level using density profiles and radial pair distribution functions. Molecules containing only polar functional groups such as urea and glucose are found predominantly in the water bulk, forming an exclusion layer near the water surface. Substitution of a single polar group by an alkyl group in sugars and amides leads to the migration of the molecule toward the interface. Within the first 2 nm from the water surface, surface-active solutes lose their rotational freedom and adopt a preferred orientation with the alkyl group pointing toward the surface. The different packing within the interface leads to different solvation shell structures and enhanced interaction between the organic molecules and absorbed OH radicals. The simulations provide quantitative information about the dimension, composition, and organization of the air-water interface as well as about the nonreactive interaction of the OH radicals with the organic solutes. It suggests that increased concentrations, preferred orientations, and decreased solvation near the air-water surface may lead to differences in reactivities between surface-active and surface-inactive molecules. The results are important to explain how heterogeneous oxidation mechanisms and kinetics within interfaces may differ from those of the bulk.																			1089-5639	1520-5215				JAN 26	2023	127	3					751	764		10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07419		JAN 2023						36639126					WOS:000918279800001

Nevertheless, the low energy conversion efficiency and output power density hinder the practical application of all-solid-state flexible ZABs due to the lacks of bifunctional oxygen catalysts with high catalytic activity and flexible solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity. Herein, we report an active and cost-effective oxygen catalyst of manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanowires supported on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (MnO2/NRGO.(Urea)) synthesized by a facile one-pot process. Along with superior stability, MnO2/NRGO-(Urea) shows the prominent activities for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), and lowest potential difference between ORR and OER among most of the manganese dioxides reported recently. Importantly, the polyacrylamide (PAM) based alkaline gel electrolyte (AGE) which shows much higher hydroxide-ion conductivity (215.6 mS cm(-2)) than the state-of-the-art polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based AGEs is employed in the all-solid-state flexible ZAB. Thanks to the MnO2/NRGO.(Urea) catalyst and PAM-based AGE, the maximum power density (P-max) of the as -fabricated all-solid-state flexible ZAB reaches 105.0 mW cm(-2) with extraordinary mechanical flexibility and robustness. Our work offers a cost-effective strategy for all-solid-state flexible ZABs with high power density and excellent energy conversion efficiency.					miao, he/GQP-0932-2022; Zhang, Chunfei/AAQ-2643-2020; sun, zixu/GYE-3224-2022; Li, Hong/AAG-2445-2020; bin, chen/HZI-0300-2023; 吴, 旭阳/IVU-7897-2023	chen, bin/0000-0002-3398-1314; Zhang, Chunfei/0000-0003-3657-3487; Li, Hong/0000-0002-6975-7787													0378-7753	1873-2755				FEB 29	2020	450								227653	10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227653	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227653													WOS:000517663800053
J	Cho, KH				Cho, Kyung-Hyun			Human Serum Amyloid a Impaired Structural Stability of High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL) and Apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I and Exacerbated Glycation Susceptibility of ApoA-I and HDL	MOLECULES												Human serum amyloid A (SAA) is an exchangeable apolipoprotein (apo) in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that influences HDL quality and functionality, particularly in the acute phase of inflammation. On the other hand, the structural and functional correlations of HDL containing SAA and apoA-I have not been reported. The current study was designed to compare the change in HDL quality with increasing SAA content in the lipid-free and lipid-bound states in reconstituted HDL (rHDL). The expressed recombinant human SAA1 (13 kDa) was purified to at least 98% and characterized in the lipid-free and lipid-bound states with apoA-I. The dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) binding ability of apoA-I was impaired severely by the addition of SAA, while SAA alone could not bind with DMPC. The recombinant human SAA1 was incorporated into the rHDL (molar ratio 95:5:1, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC): cholesterol: apoA-I) with various apoA-I:SAA molar ratios from 1:0 to 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2. With increasing SAA1 content, the rHDL particle size was reduced from 98 angstrom to 93 angstrom, and the alpha-helicity of apoA-I:SAA was decreased from 73% to 40% for (1:0) and (1:2), respectively. The wavelength maximum fluorescence (WMF) of tryptophan in rHDL was red-shifted from 339 nm to 345 nm for (1:0) and (1:2) of apoA-I:SAA, respectively, indicating that the addition of SAA to rHDL destabilized the secondary structure of apoA-I. Upon denaturation by urea treatment from 0 M to 8 M, SAA showed only a 3 nm red-shift in WMF, while apoA-I showed a 16 nm red-shift in WMF, indicating that SAA is resistant to denaturation and apoA-I had higher conformational flexibility than SAA. The glycation reaction of apoA-I in the presence of fructose was accelerated up to 1.8-fold by adding SAA in a dose-dependent manner than that of apoA-I alone. In conclusion, the incorporation of SAA in rHDL impaired the structural stability of apoA-I and exacerbated glycation of HDL and apoA-I.						cho, Kyung-Hyun/0000-0003-1198-4140														1420-3049				JUL	2022	27	13							4255	10.3390/molecules27134255	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules27134255								35807498					WOS:000823527400001

Dielectric study and electrochemical detection of ascorbic acid using modified electrode treated with europium-doped tricalcium aluminate nanoparticles	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER												The current study involved the dielectric, and sensor properties of trivalent europium (Eu3+) doped tricalcium aluminate (Ca3Al2O6) Nanoparticles. These samples were synthesized through the solution combustion method with urea (NH2CO & sdot;NH2) as the fuel. Structural analysis confirms that the samples exhibited a sustainable cubic phase with the Pm-3m space group. The irregular spherical morphology and agglomeration of synthesized particles were observed using a scanning electron microscope. The energy bandgap values were calculated using the Kubelka and Munk relation, which ranged from 5.14 to 5.27 eV. To examine the dielectric behavior at different frequencies, electrical impedance spectroscopy was performed which provided insights into the changes in electrical permittivity and revealed the contributions of both grains and grain boundaries in the samples. The synthesized material exhibited higher values of dielectric constant and loss at lower frequencies, which decreased significantly as the frequency increased. This suggests that the samples are suitable for applications in microwave devices. Also, the electrochemical studies demonstrate the sensor's rapid amperometric response to ascorbic acid oxidation. The current constructed sensor has a sensitivity of 0.0065 A for ascorbic acid and the electrode treated with Ca3-xAl2O6:xEu3+ (x = 0.05) is better able to detect the electrochemical behavior of substances like ascorbic acid.

However, its underlying mechanism is still a mystery. This study aimed to reveal the detailed roles of uric acid in inducing kidney injury and the possible mechanisms. Injection of rats with uric acid significantly increased tubular injury score, and levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urine kidney injury molecule-1. Uric acid increased the expression of collagen I, alpha-smooth muscle actin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis result showed the IL-17 signaling pathway as the most significantly enriched pathway involved in hyperuricemia-related kidney injury. Long-term injection of uric acid induced significant production of IL-17 and recruitment of Th17 cells. Treating rats with the anti-IL-17 mAb attenuated uric acid-induced kidney injury, accompanied by the inactivation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). In conclusion, uric acid was confirmed to be a risk factor for kidney injury via inducing IL-17 expression. Neutralization of IL-17 using the specific mAb relieved uric acid-induced kidney injury via inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling.

Members of the marine Roseobacter group are ubiquitous in global oceans, but their cold-adaptive strategies have barely been studied. Here, as represented by Loktanella salsilacus strains enriched in polar regions, we firstly characterized the metabolic features of a cold-adapted Roseobacter by multi-omics, enzyme activities, and carbon utilization procedures. Unlike in most cold-adapted microorganisms, the TCA cycle is enhanced by accumulating more enzyme molecules, whereas genes for thiosulfate oxidation, sulfate reduction, nitrate reduction, and urea metabolism are all expressed at lower abundance when L. salsilacus was growing at 5 degrees C in comparison with higher temperatures. Moreover, a carbon-source competition experiment has evidenced the preferential use of glucose rather than sucrose at low temperature. This selective utilization is likely to be controlled by the carbon source uptake and transformation steps, which also reflects an economic calculation balancing energy production and functional plasticity. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how a Roseobacter member and possibly others as well counteract polar constraints.

Therefore, we searched for a good antioxidant candidate that can be used as a therapeutic agent alone or in combination with other reported drugs. Earlier, we reported the A(2A) receptor antagonist properties of 7-Imino-3-substituted-2-thioxo-3,7-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)-urea derivatives (compounds 1-12) and the neuroprotective effect of compound 2. Therefore, in the present work, the antioxidant potential of compounds 1-12 was studied. Compounds 1-12 were screened using different (red/ox) tests, such as the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assay, to determine total antioxidant activity, redox status tests (with and without prooxidants) such as Advanced Oxidation Protein Products (AOPP) and Total Oxidative Status (TOS) which measures H2O2 and lipid hydroperoxides, Paraoxonase-1 Enzyme Activity (PON1), Total SH-groups content, and Total Antioxidative Status (TAS) for antioxidant determination. The Prooxidative Score, Antioxidative Score, and Oxy Score were also calculated. From the obtained results, compounds 6 (8720 FRAP value and 39.31 Oxy Score) and 12 (7866 FRAP value and 36.41 Oxy Score) were found to possess significant antioxidant activity with reasonable potential for therapeutic activity.

It exerts anticancer, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation properties. In the present study, the mechanism of protective action of apigenin on 3-chloro-1, 2-propanediol (3-MCPD)-induced renal injury was investigated in rat. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into five groups: control group (ultrapure water treated), CMC group (sodium carboxymethylcellulose treated), 3-MCPD treatment group (30 mg/kg body weight/day), 3-MCPD plus API co-treatment group (20, 40 mg/kg body weight/day). The results showed that API significantly reduced renal function markers, serum creatinine and urea nitrogen content. Besides, the renal tissue lesion in 3-MCPD treatment group was restored by API to some extent. We indicated that API exerted renoprotective effect by modulating oxidative phosphorylation especially up-regulated the expressions of ATP6 and ATP8, re-establishing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), relieving the increase of Bax/Bcl2 ratio, reducing cytochrome c release, thus inhibiting the activation of Caspase 9 and Caspase 3. In conclusion, apigenin possesses excellent protective effect against 3-MCPD-induced renal injury by modulating mitochondria dependent Caspase cascade pathway.

These have been considered dormant until recently when resting cells of Skeletonema marinoi were shown to assimilate nitrate and ammonium from the ambient environment in dark, anoxic conditions. Here, we show that resting cells of S. marinoi can also perform dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), in dark, anoxic conditions. Transmission electron microscope analyses showed that chloroplasts were compacted, and few large mitochondria had visible cristae within resting cells. Using secondary ion mass spectrometry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry combined with stable isotopic tracers, we measured assimilatory and dissimilatory processes carried out by resting cells of S. marinoi under dark, anoxic conditions. Nitrate was both respired by DNRA and assimilated into biomass by resting cells. Cells assimilated nitrogen from urea and carbon from acetate, both of which are sources of dissolved organic matter produced in sediments. Carbon and nitrogen assimilation rates corresponded to turnover rates of cellular carbon and nitrogen content ranging between 469 and 10,000 years. Hence, diatom resting cells can sustain their cells in dark, anoxic sediments by slowly assimilating and respiring substrates from the ambient environment.

Here we develop a direct deep eutectic solvent (DES) calcining method to prepare low-dimensional and highly active TMOs for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Glucose monohydrate and urea can form a glucose-urea DES, which was calcined under a N-2 atmosphere to produce 2D N,O-doped graphene. When metal precursors were introduced into the glucose-urea DES and calcined together, the TMOs were templated by graphene flakes and exhibited low-dimensional morphologies. With this method, 2D nanonet-shaped La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF), Co3O4, NiCo2O4, and RuO2 and 1D nanowire-shaped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF) were readily synthesized, and their thickness and porosity can be conveniently tuned by adjusting the concentrations of metal salts. Our nanostructured TMOs were further applied for the OER, and they showed quite competitive activities over their counterparts obtained from other methods. The 2D porous LSCF20-DES exhibited the largest specific surface area (28.9 m(2) g(-1)) and the highest OER electrocatalytic activities (0.304 V overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)). These results demonstrate that the DES calcining method is a comprehensive approach to synthesize hierarchical TMOs as highly active OER catalysts.

J	Holecek, M				Holecek, Milan			Muscle Amino Acid and Adenine Nucleotide Metabolism during Exercise and in Liver Cirrhosis: Speculations on How to Reduce the Harmful Effects of Ammonia	METABOLITES												Studies from the last decades indicate that increased levels of ammonia contribute to muscle wasting in critically ill patients. The aim of the article is to examine the effects of two different causes of hyperammonemia-increased ATP degradation in muscles during strenuous exercise and impaired ammonia detoxification to urea due to liver cirrhosis. During exercise, glycolysis, citric acid cycle (CAC) activity, and ATP synthesis in muscles increase. In cirrhosis, due to insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction, glycolysis, CAC activity, and ATP synthesis in muscles are impaired. Both during exercise and in liver cirrhosis, there is increased ammonia detoxification to glutamine (Glu + NH3 + ATP -> Gln + ADP + Pi), increased drain of ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) from CAC for glutamate synthesis by alpha-KG-linked aminotransferases, glutamate, aspartate, and alpha-KG deficiency, increased oxidation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA; valine, leucine, and isoleucine), and protein-energy wasting in muscles. It is concluded that ammonia can contribute to muscle wasting regardless of the cause of its increased levels and that similar strategies can be designed to increase muscle performance in athletes and reduce muscle loss in patients with hyperammonemia. The pros and cons of glutamate, alpha-KG, aspartate, BCAA, and branched-chain keto acid supplementation are discussed.					, Milan/A-1699-2017	, Milan/0000-0003-0385-8881														2218-1989				OCT	2022	12	10							971	10.3390/metabo12100971	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo12100971								36295872					WOS:000873013800001

The S/N co-doped GQDs are synthesized through an efficient infrared-assisted pyrolysis of glucose, urea, and ammonia sulfate at 280 degrees C. The S/N co-doped GQDs, having an average diameter of 6.2 nm, contain high oxidation, amidation, and sulfuration levels (45.8 (O/C), 22.7 (N/C), and 7.8 at.% (S/C), respectively). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is utilized to assess the overpotential distributions for VRFBs equipped with untreated GF and S/N co-doped GQDs/GF. With the aid of S/N co-doped GQDs, the catalytic activity, equivalent series resistance, durability, and voltage efficiency are substantially improved. The improved performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of GQDs containing O functionalities, lattice N atoms, and S dopants, facilitating surface catalytic activity and accelerating charge transfer across the anode/anolyte interface for the vanadium redox couples (V (II)/V(III)). Accordingly, hierarchical S/N co-doped GQD/GF electrode paves the pathway for engineering the electrodes' nano-structure with improved catalytic activity and enhanced durability for redox flow batteries.

This study aims to investigate in vitro XO inhibitory and in vivo anti-hyperuricemic properties of sodium kaempferol-3'-sulfonate (KS). The kinetic analysis indicates that KS is a reversible competitive inhibitor and has significant inhibitory effects on XO activity with an IC50 value of 0.338 mu M. Fluorescence spectra suggested that KS could cause fluorescence quenching and conformational changes of XO due to the formation of a KS-XO complex. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that KS interacted with several amino acid residues of XO by the 7C-7C stacking, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. The inhibitory mechanism of KS on XO activity might be the insertion of KS into the active site of XO to prevent the entrance of the substrate xanthine and induce conformational changes of XO. The results carried out in hyperuricemic mice showed that KS reduced serum XO activity, serum uric acid (UA), creatinine (CRE), and urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, as well as alleviating renal histopathological injury. These findings suggest that KS may be a new potent XO inhibitor against hyperuricemia-related diseases.

In this work, we have developed a facile template-free hydrothermal method to synthesize various 3D SnO2 hierarchical superstructures. It is found that the amount of urea, pH value and the pre-oxidation process play a crucial role in the micro/nanostructural evolutions of building blocks and final products. Oriented attachment and self-assembling dual-controlled mechanisms are then proposed to illustrate the formation of 3D hierarchical superstructures. The application in photocatalysis for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) demonstrates that the as-synthesized SnO2 hierarchical superstructures have highly efficient photocatalytic activity for the degradation of organic pollutants. Particularly, the SnO2 hierarchical superstructure constructed by ultrathin nanosheets can degrade 93% of MB within 150 min, which is much higher than that of commercial SnO2 powders. The enhanced photocatalytic performances can be attributed to the high surface-to-volume ratio, the abundant active sites and the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes induced by the unique 3D loose and microporous superstructures. These new insights obtained in this study will be beneficial for the practical applications of oxide semiconductor materials for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.

The amorphous Ni(OH)(2)/CQDs microspheres were prepared by a CQDs assistant crystallization inhibition process. The morphologies and composition of the microspheres were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, EDS, and TG/DSC. The results showed that the microspheres had uniform heterogeneous phases with amorphous Ni(OH)(2) and CQDs. The sensor based on amorphous Ni(OH)(2)/CQDs microspheres showed remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards glucose oxidation comparing to the conventional crystalline Ni(OH)(2), which included two linear range (20 mu M-350 mu M and 0.45mM-2.5 mM) with high selectivity of 2760.05 and 1853.64 mu A mM(-1)cm(-2). Moreover, the interference from the commonly interfering species such as urea, ascorbic acid, NaCl, L-proline and L-Valine, can be effectively avoided. The high sensitivity, wide glucose detection range and good selectivity of the electrode may be due to their synergistic effect of amorphous phase and CQDs incorporation. These findings may promote the application of amorphous Ni(OH)(2) as advanced electrochemical glucose sensing materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanism of the spontaneous detonation of ammonium nitrate in reactive grounds	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												The mechanism of the decomposition of ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and of ammonium nitrate (AN) emulsions has been investigated. The formation of NO gas bubbles at the end of an induction period was observed, which led to the evolution of brown NO2 gas on contact with air. Inhibition of the decomposition reaction could be achieved by reducing the NO concentration in the gas phase, with inhibitors not in physical contact with the reaction mixture. NO adsorbing clay minerals (hydrotalcite) were effective inhibitors, indicating multiple mechanisms of inhibition. A central role is assigned to nitrous acid (HNO2): sequestering NO prevents its formation, base inhibitors keep it in the non-reactive form of the nitrite ion (pKa of HNO2 similar to 3), and urea in acidic conditions decomposes it to harmless N-2. Our results have implications in industries where NOx emissions can cause significant environmental problems for both aquatic and marine life as well as for human health.

Nitrification inhibitors effectively target N2O-producing Nitrosospira spp. in tropical soil	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The nitrification inhibitors (NIs) 3,4-dimethylpyrazole (DMPP) and dicyandiamide (DCD) can effectively reduce N2O emissions; however, which species are targeted and the effect of these NIs on the microbial nitrifier community is still unclear. Here, we identified the ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) species linked to N2O emissions and evaluated the effects of urea and urea with DCD and DMPP on the nitrifying community in a 258 day field experiment under sugarcane. Using an amoA AOB amplicon sequencing approach and mining a previous dataset of 16S rRNA sequences, we characterized the most likely N2O-producing AOB as a Nitrosospira spp. and identified Nitrosospira (AOB), Nitrososphaera (archaeal ammonia oxidizer) and Nitrospira (nitrite-oxidizer) as the most abundant, present nitrifiers. The fertilizer treatments had no effect on the alpha and beta diversities of the AOB communities. Interestingly, we found three clusters of co-varying variables with nitrifier operational taxonomic units (OTUs): the N2O-producing AOB Nitrosospira with N2O, NO3-, NH4+, water-filled pore space (WFPS) and pH; AOA Nitrososphaera with NO3-, NH4+ and pH; and AOA Nitrososphaera and NOB Nitrospira with NH4+, which suggests different drivers. These results support the co-occurrence of non-N2O-producing Nitrososphaera and Nitrospira in the unfertilized soils and the promotion of N2O-producing Nitrosospira under urea fertilization. Further, we suggest that DMPP is a more effective NI than DCD in tropical soil under sugarcane.

We aimed to evaluate how, in overfed mini pigs, nutrients use and partition were regulated in the gut and liver. Net nutrients fluxes were assessed in the fed (PP) and post absorptive (PA) states at 1, 14 and 60 days of adaptation to overfeeding in five adult Yucatan female multicatheterized minipigs. Pigs PA glycaemia and PP-induced hyperglycemia remained unchanged over the experimental period, suggesting that the management of the excess of energy intake allowed the maintenance of glucose levels. This was associated with (1) an increased PA plasma insulin, (2) an increased gut lactate production (increased lactate net release +89%, 1 h PP, D1 vs. D60) probably from an increased glucose oxidation, (3) a shift in utilization of gluconeogenic precursor (lactate, propionate) in the liver, and (4) a reduced gut utilization of nitrogen moieties for energy purposes (glutamine), a nitrogen sparing effect at the whole body level (decreased plasma urea in PA (-24% D1 vs. D60) and PP states) and a specific increased level of AA involved in lipids handling and bile recycling in the gut lumen (taurine and glycine).

In this manuscript, we report that graphene oxide (GO) facilitates the transformation of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to Ni-MOF (metal organic framework) nanorods anchored on reduced graphene oxide (Ni-MOF@rGO) through NMP (N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone)-based coordination in ionic liquids. Morphological studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed mesoporous three-dimensional structures of micrometer-long Ni-MOF nanorods anchored on reduced graphene substrates (Ni-MOF@rGO ), whereas structural studies using XRD and Raman spectra demonstrated the crystallinity of Ni-MOF nanorods. Chemical analysis of Ni-MOF@rGO carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that nickel moieties exist in an electroactive OH-Ni-OH state, which was further confirmed by nanoscale elemental maps recorded using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The applicability of Ni-MOF@rGO as an electro-catalyst in a urea-enhanced water oxidation reaction (UOR) is reported. Furthermore, the ability of our newly developed NMP-based IL to grow MOF nanocubes on carbon nanotubes and MOF nano-islands on carbon fibers is also reported.

Structural and electronic investigation of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1 H )-ones (DHPMs): Correlations between spectroscopic and molecular docking features upon salmon sperm DNA	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE												A set of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1 H )-ones (DHPMs) was prepared via a "one-pot" three-component Biginelli reaction using different aldehydes, ethyl acetoacetate, urea, and catalyzed by iron chloride hexahydrate. Subsequently, these compounds were submitted to chemical oxidation with nitric acid in order to obtain their respective oxidized forms. Density functional theory (DFT) was applied to investigate the structural, electronic, and bonding characteristics of these compounds. This study results show that in the DHPMs ( 1 - 3 ), the six-membered ring adopts a pseudo-boat conformation, and the heights of the C4 and N1 atoms from the boat plane depend on the type of the substituent on the aryl ring. Experimental electronic spectra for all compounds were recorded and compared with simulations obtained by timedependent-DFT (TD-DFT). The interaction between those DHPMs and salmon sperm DNA was monitored spectrophotometrically in the UV region, binding constants ( K b ) were estimated, and docking studies were performed using the PatchDock (R) server. Considering the differences in overall planarity and spectral signature of the compounds studied, we concluded that the reduced DHPMs are prone to achieve partial intercalation of their structures between the DNA nitrogen base pairs while the oxidized ones prefer to stay deep inside of the minor groove of this biomolecule.

Herein, Te nanoneedles (NNs) that act both chemically and physically on bacteria are synthesized by a facile method using Na2TeO3, urea and glucose. It is found that the prepared Te NNs have a strong affinity to the cell membrane of bacteria and subsequently promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacteria, resulting in an excellent antibacterial effect toward Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative). What's more, this needle-like morphology also can physically damage the bacterial cell membranes. The Te NNs per se are inert in mammalian cells to produce ROS at a proper concentration, indicating considerable biocompatibility of this material. As a proof-of-concept, the antibacterial Te NNs were used as an anti-inflammatory reagent for promoting bacteria-infected wound healing in vivo, during which Te NNs caused no evident side effects to major organs in mice. Additionally, the antibacterial activity is maintained in the presence of surface oxidation of Te NNs after long-term dispersion in phosphate buffered saline solution. The needle-like Te NMs with long-term antibacterial stability and good biocompatibility have great potential for the treatment of associated infectious diseases.					ma, zhijun/A-8294-2015; Chen, Lingling/JCD-4631-2023; Li, Lihua/C-5147-2019	Li, Lihua/0000-0001-6651-2146; liu, meng/0000-0002-5685-6575													2590-0064					JUN	2022	15								100271	10.1016/j.mtbio.2022.100271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mtbio.2022.100271		MAY 2022						35572856					WOS:000806604900005

Effect of dietary protein on energy metabolism including protein synthesis in the spiny lobster Sagmariasus verreauxi	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												This is the first study in an aquatic ectotherm to combine a stoichiometric bioenergetic approach with an endpoint stochastic model to explore dietary macronutrient content. The combination of measuring respiratory gas (O-2 and CO2) exchange, nitrogenous (ammonia and urea) excretion, specific dynamic action (SDA), metabolic energy substrate use, and whole-body protein synthesis in spiny lobster, Sagmariasus verreauxi, was examined in relation to dietary protein. Three isoenergetic feeds were formulated with varying crude protein: 40%, 50% and 60%, corresponding to CP40, CP50 and CP60 treatments, respectively. Total CO2 and ammonia excretion, SDA magnitude and coefficient, and protein synthesis in the CP60 treatment were higher compared to the CP40 treatment. These differences demonstrate dietary protein influences post-prandial energy metabolism. Metabolic use of each major energy substrate varied at different post-prandial times, indicating suitable amounts of high-quality protein with major non-protein energy-yielding nutrients, lipid and carbohydrate, are critical for lobsters. The average contribution of protein oxidation was lowest in the CP50 treatment, suggesting mechanisms underlying the most efficient retention of dietary protein and suitable dietary inclusion. This study advances understanding of how deficient and surplus dietary protein affects energy metabolism and provides approaches for fine-scale feed evaluation to support sustainable aquaculture.					; WANG, Shuangyao/JNT-4380-2023; Smith, Gregory/C-9263-2013; Carter, Chris G./A-3438-2008	Fitzgibbon, Quinn/0000-0002-1104-3052; WANG, Shuangyao/0000-0003-1074-011X; codabaccus, mohamed/0000-0001-5108-373X; Smith, Gregory/0000-0002-8677-1230; Carter, Chris G./0000-0001-5210-1282													2045-2322					JUN 3	2021	11	1							11814	10.1038/s41598-021-91304-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91304-1								34083691					WOS:000662236000109

Risk associated with the pesticide is not clearly defined, so it is important to remove/degrade TDZ with an efficient and environment friendly technology. Here, we investigated the use of Ag/AgCl-activated carbon (Ag/AgCl-AC) composites in photocatalytic degradation of TDZ under LED light. By the synergic effect of Ag/AgCl and AC, the optimum Ag/carbon weight ratio of 2:1 exhibited superior visible-light photocatalytic activity, the highest removal efficiency was close to 91% in pH 7 matrix. Different types of Ag/AgCl-AC composites were tested, all showed much faster photodegradation kinetics than bare Ag/AgCl in 210 min. The degradation products as identified by HPLC-MS revealed that the hydroxylation by hydroxyl radicals and that of oxidation by superoxide radicals as well as holes were the two main pathways for TDZ degradation. Results revealed that the adsorption concentrated TDZ molecules and the photocatalytically generated radicals rapidly degradated TDZ, the two contributions functioned together for removal of the pollutant from water.

After headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), VOC profiles were determined by gas chromatography (GC). Chemical and VOC (log(10) transformations of the peak areas) data were submitted to a two-way ANOVA to assess the feeding system (FS) and season (S) effects; an interactive principal component analysis (iPCA) was also performed. The interaction FS x S was never significant. The FS showed the highest (p < 0.05) protein and casein content for hay-milk samples, while it did not affect any VOCs. Winter milk had higher (p < 0.05) proportions of protein, casein, fat and some carboxylic acids, while summer milk was higher (p < 0.05) in urea and 2-pentanol and methyl aldehydes. The iPCA confirmed a seasonal spatial separation. Carboxylic acids might generate from incomplete esterification in the mammary gland and/or milk lipolytic activity, while aldehydes seemed to be correlated with endogenous lipid or amino acid oxidation and/or feed transfer. The outcomes suggested that VOCs could be an operative support to trace raw milk for further mild processing.

These NPs possess a high surface area and band gap of 3.2 eV, can produce both OH degrees (hydroxide) and O2-degrees (superoxide) radicals for the generation of holes (h+) and electrons (e-), resulting in oxidation and reduction of the pollutants in their valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) resulting in degradation of dyes (95-100% degradation of MB, MO, and RhB dyes), reduction and removal of heavy metal ions (Cu2+, Pb2+, Cr6+, etc.), degradation of pharmaceutical compounds (paracetamol, urea, fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin)) using photocatalysis. Here, we review an overview of various plant extracts used for the green synthesis of ZnO NPs and their potential applications in environmental remediation including photocatalysis, adsorption, and heavy metal remediation. This review summarizes the most recent studies and further research perspectives to explore their applications in various fields.

The study was developed following the methodological guidelines of ISO 14040. Inventories data for a gate-to-gate assessment of MDF manufacturing were collected by on-site surveys. Ten impact categories including of: Abiotic depletion (AD), Acidification (AC), Eutrophication (EP), Global warming (GW), Ozone layer depletion (OLD), Fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity (FE), Marine aquatic ecotoxicity (ME), Human toxicity (HT), Terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE) and Photochemical oxidation (PO) in three subsystem of manufacturing process were assessed. The subsystem of fiber preparation was the major contributor to the environmental impacts. Urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin production was identified as the main hotspot, except in AD, AC, OLD and PO impacts that natural gas, electricity, transport and production process were the main hotspots, respectively. Moreover, Tube dryer, MDF saw and hogger were the most effective sectors in the emissions of production process. Results for substitution of natural gas showed that except in some impacts categories, use of alternative source of thermal energy such as wood residue could improve emissions from manufacturing.

Urease is a virulence factor in several human pathogens, while causing severe environmental and agronomic problems. Sporosarcina pasteurii urease has been used extensively in the structural characterization of the enzyme. Sodium sulfite has been widely used as a preservative in urease solutions to prevent oxygen-induced oxidation, but its role as an inhibitor has also been suggested. In the present study, isothermal titration microcalorimetry was used to establish sulfite as a competitive inhibitor for S. pasteurii urease, with an inhibition constant of 0.19 mM at pH 7. The structure of the urease-sulfite complex, determined at 1.65 angstrom resolution, shows the inhibitor bound to the dinuclear Ni(II) center of urease in a tridentate mode involving bonds between the two Ni(II) ions in the active site and all three oxygen atoms of the inhibitor, supporting the observed competitive inhibition kinetics. This coordination mode of sulfite has never been observed, either in proteins or in small molecule complexes, and could inspire synthetic coordination chemists as well as biochemists to develop urease inhibitors based on this chemical moiety.

Herein, facile and mass fabrication of low-cost tungsten single-atom photocatalysts is achieved by directly calcining urea and sodium tungstate under atmosphere (W-SA-PCN-m, urea amount m = 7.5, 15, 30, and 150 g). The single-atom photocatalysts can manage H2O2 in situ generation and decomposition into center dot OH, thus achieving highly efficient CH4 photooxidation in water vapor under mild conditions. Systematic investigations demonstrate that integration of multifunctions of methane activation, H2O2 generation, and decomposition into one photocatalyst can dramatically promote methane conversion to C1 oxygenates with a yield as high as 4956 mu mol g(cat)(-1), superior to that of the most reported non-precious photocatalysts. Liquid-solid phase transition can induce the products to facilely switch in from HCOOH to CH3OH by pulling the catalyst above water with CH3OH/HCOOH ratio from 10% (in H2O) to 80% (above H2O).

These nanomaterials were synthesized by the solution combustion method using glucose and urea as fuels. Structural investigations revealed that the synthesized materials are single-phase, highly crystalline, and porous, with spherical agglomerated nanoparticles of crystallite size ranging from 13 nm to 17 nm. Particle size distribution and pore area distribution were plotted using imageJ software. Energy dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the accurate elemental composition of all samples, consistent with the calculated stoichiometry. Optical absorption studies showed a blue shift in the peak as the doping concentration increased, indicating a quantum confinement effect. Dielectric constant and electrical resistivity measurements ensured that the materials are electrically conducting, which is necessary for humidity sensing applications. Humidity sensing measurements demonstrated that the capacitive humidity sensitivity coefficient (SC) and resistive humidity sensitivity coefficient (SR) were highest for the La (0.05) sample. The XPS survey spectra and high-resolution core-level spectra provide a thorough understanding of the elemental composition, oxidation states, and electronic environments in La-doped cobalt chromite nanoparticles. This detailed analysis is critical for tailoring the material's properties for specific applications in catalysis, electronics, and magnetic devices.

Patients with obesity (n = 31) or T2D (n = 26) and sex- and age-matched controls (n = 28) were recruited, and serum and tear samples were collected. The concentration of 23 amino acids and 10 biogenic amines in serum and tear samples was analyzed. Statistical analysis and Pearson correlation analysis along with network analysis were carried out. Compared to controls, changes in the level of 6 analytes in the obese group and of 10 analytes in the T2D group were statistically significant. For obesity, the energy generation, while for T2D, the involvement of NO synthesis and its relation to insulin signaling and inflammation, were characteristic. We found that BCAA and glutamine metabolism, urea cycle, and beta-oxidation make up crucial parts of the metabolic changes in T2D. According to our data, the retromer-mediated retrograde transport, the ethanolamine metabolism, and, consequently, the endocannabinoid signaling and phospholipid metabolism were characteristic of both conditions and can be relevant pathways to understanding and treating insulin resistance. By providing potential therapeutic targets and new starting points for mechanistic studies, our results emphasize the importance of complex data analysis procedures to better understand the pathomechanism of obesity and diabetes.

J	Papakonstantinou, S				Papakonstantinou, Stratos			Assessment of serum glutamate dehydrogenase activity and comparison to serum alanine aminotransferase activity in cats with increased blood total T4 concentration	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION												Glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), a key enzyme in amino acid oxidation and urea production, is mainly derived from the liver and its activity may increase with hepatocellular necrosis. Feline hyperthyroidism is associated with elevated serum activities of various enzymes, but the pattern of serum GLDH activity has not been reported, to our knowledge. Feline clinical biochemistry results from 2 commercial diagnostic laboratories were reviewed retrospectively to assess changes in serum GLDH activity in cats with significantly elevated serum total T4 concentrations, which is highly suggestive of hyperthyroidism. A total of 2,773 records were analyzed, of which 2,370 (85%) had normal total T4 (<= 50 nmol/L) and 403 (15%) had increased total T4 (>= 60 nmol/L) concentrations. Among cats with an increased total T4 concentration, 26.5% had increased serum GLDH activity. All cats with increased GLDH activity also had increased serum ALT activity. In 42.9% of cats, ALT activity was increased, but GLDH activity was normal. In 30.5% of cats, both serum GLDH and ALT activities were within RIs. The fold-increase of GLDH activity was almost half of the ALT fold-increase. Although serum GLDH activity increased in some cats with hyperthyroidism, serum ALT activity increased more frequently and to a greater extent.																			1040-6387	1943-4936				MAY	2023	35	3					300	303		10.1177/10406387231153931	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387231153931		FEB 2023						36744764					WOS:000924789200001

Here, we report a novel strategy to simultaneously overcome the agglomeration and poor conductivity of LDOs via calcining the mixture of polystyrene microsphere supported MgFeAl-LDH and urea, in which the introduction of hollow structure and nitrogen-doped carbon composition can not only significantly increase the specific surface area to expose more active sites, but also remarkably improve conductivity to accelerate electron transfer, giving rise to the outstanding performance of the final catalyst (HC@LDH-CN) in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Systematic characterizations and experiments further confirm that O-2(center dot-) radicals play the dominant role in HC@LDO-CN/PMS system, which can altogether remove the model pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) in 10 min with k(obs) to be 0.403 min(-1). Particularly, the HC@LDO-CN still maintains extraordinary catalytic activity for BPA degradation in an extremely high-salt wastewater (100 mM). Our strategy thereby provides an innovative notion to synthesize efficient PMS-based catalysts for organic pollutant degradation in high saline water.

In this study, ferrous iron and inorganic sulfur-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus strain IBUN Ppt12 most similar to Acidithiobacillus ferrianus and inorganic sulfur compound oxidizing Acidithiobacillus sp. IBUNS3 were grown in co-culture during biooxidation of refractory FeAsS. Total RNA was extracted and sequenced from the planktonic cells to reveal genes with different transcript counts involved in the response to FeAsS containing medium. The co-culture's response to arsenic release during biooxidation included the ars operon genes that were independently regulated according to the arsenopyrite concentration. Additionally, increased mRNA transcript counts were identified for transmembrane ion transport proteins, stress response mechanisms, accumulation of inorganic polyphosphates, urea catabolic processes, and tryptophan biosynthesis. Acidithiobacillus spp. RNA transcripts also included those encoding the Rus and PetI proteins involved in ferrous iron oxidation and gene clusters annotated as encoding inorganic sulfur compound metabolism enzymes. Finally, mRNA counts of genes related to DNA methylation, management of oxidative stress, chemotaxis, and motility during biooxidation were decreased compared to cells growing without mineral. The results provide insights into the adaptation of Acidithiobacillus spp. to growth during biooxidation of arsenic-bearing sulfides.

The as-prepared CN/Pt/TiO2 composites show a higher photocurrent density compared to CN/TiO2. The CN/Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts exhibit an enhanced H-2 evolution rate of 8.93 mu mol h(-1) under visible light irradiation, which is 1.25 times higher than that of CN/TiO2 (7.15 mu mol h(-1)), while Pt/TiO2 and TiO2 nanowires do not show any visible light responses. Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that CN/Pt/TiO2 with a unique core-shell nanowire structure of semiconductor-metal-semiconductor enables concurrent hydrogen evolution through photo-induced water splitting and RhB degradation by photo-oxidation in the visible range. This result is probably attributable to the formation of a heterojunction and the Pt nanoclusters in CN/Pt/TiO2, facilitating the electron transfer from the LUMO of g-C3N4 to that of TiO2 and generating different active sites upon photo-absorption in the CN layers. Our work provides a feasible way to obtain H-2 while treating sewage using photocatalysis.

A rat model of NAFLD was constructed according to the histopathological data and biochemical parameters, while the underlying mechanisms of high-fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD and the therapeutic effects of chicory polysaccharides (CP) were studied by the adoption of serum metabolomics. The serum metabolites were analyzed by GC/MS. Multivariate statistical approaches such as principal component analysis, revealed significant differences with HFD model and CP groups against the control. Results indicated that CP plays a regulatory role in the occurrence of NAFLD. Meantime, a total of 65 candidate biomarkers were screened and identified. Cluster analysis, enrichment analysis and metabolic pathway analysis of differential metabolites also indicated that amino acid metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis in NAFLD rats, the beta-oxidation and urea cycle of very long-chain fatty acids were mainly disturbed when compared against the control group. The corresponding metabolic pathways in the CP group were relieved compared against the NAFLD rats. These results showed that untargeted metabonomics helps to explain intervention effects of chicory polysaccharide with the rat model of NAFLD. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Based on plasma metabolites (N = 640), fat gain and distribution and residual feed intake (bulls) or energy-corrected milk yield (cows), the animals were divided into two divergent metabolic groups. Project-specific transcript annotations were created using RNA sequencing data from four tissues (liver, jejunum, skeletal muscle, and rumen) and the bovine reference genome (UCD3.1 or ARS-UCD.1.2). These annotations contained 7,646 and 6,161 transcripts classified as lncRNAs, respectively. Using correlation, network and pathway enrichment analyses, the gene regulatory potential and the possible biological function were determined for lncRNAs. The results underlined the involvement of lncRNAs in various metabolic processes, such as the citrate and urea cycles, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid-beta oxidation, the PPAR pathway, amino acid and lipid metabolism and protein biosynthesis. Co-expression with colocalised protein-coding genes suggested a joint regulation or transcriptional stabilisation function of the lncRNAs. Results from this dissertation contributed to the further annotation of the bovine genome.

Soil NOx emissions mainly come from soil microbial processes, but there is little evidence that the photocatalytic activities of inorganic minerals in the soil would affect the NOx transformation. This work studied the effect of soil types, red soil particle sizes, application of urea, and the organic matter content on the NO degradation efficiency and NO2 production, demonstrated that NOx exchange in soils by photochemical reactions and the degradation activity of NO varied widely amongst different soil types. The red soil has an obvious photocatalytic oxidation effect on 1 ppm NO in the air (removal efficiency reaches 24%), and the selectivity for ion species is close to 100%. Soil oxidizes extraneous NO under visible light, it can also oxidize the intrinsic nitrogen-containing compounds into NO2 to contribute emissions in the atmosphere. The ferric oxide could be important for the color of red soil, but its mixture with other minerals is more important for photocatalysis. This nitrogen conversion mechanism provides an alternative pathway for soil NO2 emissions and a new perspective for the nitrogen cycle.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Raman and Humidity Sensing Properties of Sm<SUP>3+</SUP> Doped CoCr2O4 for Humidity Sensor Applications	JOURNAL OF INORGANIC AND ORGANOMETALLIC POLYMERS AND MATERIALS												This research presents the structural, microstructural, Raman, XPS and humidity sensing behaviour of Sm3+ doped cobalt chromite (CoCr2O4). All samples are synthesized using solution combustion method with urea and glucose as fuels. The X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the single-phase formation with a spinel cubic structure. Field emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs revealed that the materials are porous and include soft agglomerations. Elemental analysis was performed using Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, confirming the presence of Samarium (3+) in the Sm3+ doped CoCr2O4 samples. The oxidation state of each element was determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for CoCr1.98Sm0.02O4 samples. The vibration bands identified by the Raman spectra confirm the formation of the spinel cubic structure. The electrical properties were measured by using an LCR meter, and it was observed that smaller crystallite size exhibits higher dielectric constant. All the electrical properties were found to increase with increasing samarium concentration. In humid conditions, this material's resistance to electricity and permittivity and permittivity changes with frequency, making it useful as a capacitive and resistive humidity sensor. The findings of this work pave the way for the use of metal-doped magnetic chromites in applications for humidity sensing.

Thus, a complex set of variables dictate the far-from-equilibrium nature of these biological assemblies. Mimicking such systems synthetically is a challenging task. We report multi-stimuli responsive transient coacervation of an aldehyde-appended polymer and a short peptide. The coacervates are formed by the disulphide linkages between the peptide molecules and the imine bond between the polymer and the peptide. Imines are susceptible to pH changes and the disulphide bonds can be tuned by oxidation/reduction processes. Thus, the coacervation is operational only under the combined effect of appropriate pH and oxidative conditions. Taking advantage of these facts, the coacervates are transiently formed under a pH cycle (urea-urease/gluconolactone) and a non-equilibrium redox cycle (TCEP/H2O2). Importantly, the system showed high adaptability toward environmental changes. The transient existence of the coacervates can be generated without any apparent change in size and shape within the same system through the sequential application of the above-mentioned nonequilibrium reaction cycles. Additionally, the coacervation allows for efficient encapsulation/stabilisation of proteins. Thus, the system has the potential to be used for protein/drug delivery purposes in the future.

The detection has been monitored by correlating the attenuation of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band intensity of Ag/NCNPs at similar to 416 nm in presence of Au3+ and S2- ions. Successive oxidation of Ag in the formulation, in presence of Au3+ ions in the system and subsequent in-situ formation of Au is assigned to the gradual diminution of the LSPR band. Likewise, depreciation of the LSPR band in the presence of S2- ions has been related to the depletion of Ag via the in-situ formation of Ag2S. The limit of detection (LOD) for Au3+ and S2- ions was found to be as low as 0.16 mu M and 0.18 mu M, respectively, and the presence of other common water-soluble ions making no significant contribution endorses the high sensitivity and selectivity of the probe.

Erythrosine, a commonly used coloring agent in tablet preparation was studied for its role when supplemented with sub necrotic dose of DENA (n-diethyl nitrosamine) to induced HCC in Wistar rats. Single dose of chemical carcinogen DENA with intraperitoneal injection (20 mg/kg) administered before Erythrosine at a dose 0.014 mg/kg by p.o, DENA treated rats and alone. Exposure of DENA and Erythrosine alters the levels of Serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGoT), Serum glutamate pyrophosphate transaminase (SGPT), Alkaline phosphate (ALP), Total Bilirubin (TBR), Blood uric acid, urea, lipid profile and Serum alpha-feto protein (AFP) in Wistar rats, with further alteration in intracellular antioxidant enzyme profile Lipid Per oxidation (LPo), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), Melanoaldehyde (MDA), Glutathione Reductase (GR), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione (GSH), Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), Superoxide Dismutase (SoD) along with Vit.

Here we develop a novel solvent-induced phase separation technique for fast and continuous preparation of hierarchically macro-/microporous carbon beads (MMCBs). The asprepared MMCBs show spherical shape with millimeter size, which give the carbons many value-added physical properties such as regular geometry, good mechanical properties, low dust, and good flowability. The MMCBs have a high BET surface area of 1099 m2 g-1, and percolating macroporous superstructure with axialoriented macrovoid channel and sponge-like bicontinuous network issued from solvent-induced macrophase separation and microphase separation, respectively. In addition, the MMCBs have a high nitrogen doing of 4-5 wt% originated from their nitrogen-rich polyacrylonitrile precursor. The MMCBs could directly sever as the metal-free carbon catalysts for room-temperature oxidation of NO to NO2 with over 80% conversion, and the urea-loaded MMCBs could use for selective catalytic reduction of NO to N2 with long-time NOx removal. This convenient synthesis to porous carbons with the engineered morphology and percolating macropores has great potential in practical applications where both rapid mass transport and high surface areas are required.

Fluorescent graphitic carbon nitride and graphene oxide quantum dots as efficient nanozymes: Colorimetric detection of fluoride ion in water by graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Development of strategies based on artificial nanozymes over natural enzymes for sensing of toxic ions in water has drawn tremendous interest among researchers. Herein, we have reported a facile synthesis of fluorescent graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g-CNQDs) and graphene oxide quantum dots (GQDs) using simple, costeffective and low-temperature methods from readily available precursors such as urea, trisodium citrate, and citric acid. The peroxidase mimic activity of prepared g-CNQDs and GQDs (nanozymes) were established without functionalizing or doping with other nanoparticles. These nanozymes acted as efficient catalysts, facilitating the simultaneous reduction of H2O2 and oxidation of colorless peroxidase substrate 3,3',5,5'- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to produce a blue color oxidized TMB in presence of H2O2. Thus, a simple colorimetric system is established based on the enzyme mimic activity of the synthesized g-CNQDs for detection of fluoride ions in aqueous solution. The g-CNQDs showed high sensitivity and selectivity towards the detection of fluoride ions in water with a detection limit 4.06 mu M in a wide detection range upto 120 mu M. This study provides the evidence that the reported colorimetric technique is green, economic, fast responsive, sensitive, and highly selective which can be further utilized for the detection of fluoride ion in naturally occurring water samples.

The function of the ULP gel is not only that it can be doped into the conductive ink to decrease the resistance of the conductive printing paper but also that it increases the stability of V2O5-based electrodes. Moreover, 3D network V2O5 WSSCs containing the ULP gel can support high operating voltages of 4.0 V with great specific capacitance (160 F/g) and offer a high energy density (355 W h/kg at 0.2 kW/kg). The 3D network V2O5 WSSCs exhibit a superior cycling stability/durability after 5000 cycles (capacitance retention of similar to 91%). Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments show the reversibility and pseudocapacitive properties of V2O5 from the ULP gel and offer the information of the oxidation states of vanadium during charge-discharge cycles. The 3D network V2O5 WSSCs with the ULP gel electrolyte show great potential prospective candidates for smarter 3D wearable energy-storage devices and Internet-of-Things applications.

In the current work, NiMo Al2O3 samples were prepared by combustion synthesis via one-pot process using urea and starch as fuel, and then treated in a flow of CH4/CO2 at 800 degrees C to in-situ synthesize the Ni-Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst, which was then tested in CH4/CO2 for DRM. The results indicate that the Ni-Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst was successfully formed, and there was a strong interaction of Ni-0-Mo2C via in-situ carburization; within DRM, CH4 can be converted by Ni-0 into intermediate species of C*, and was then further transformed into CO by the adjacent Mo2C species in a catalytic cycle. Meanwhile, there were improved specific surface area and resistance to oxidation and sintering, as suggested by BET, XRD and XPS. As a result, the conversion of CO2 and mole ratio of H-2/CO maintained stable near 94% and 0.99, respectively, and the conversion of CH4 remained stable near 89.4% in a 15-h DRM test.

The as-synthesized NH2-MIL-53(Al) nano-plates exhibited excellent water :solubility and stability. In the present work, it can be found that strong fluorescence of NH2-MIL-53(Al) nanoplates was significantly suppressed after the addition of free chlorine, and a simple sensing system for fast, highly selective direct detection of free chlorine in water was established. Compared with other, fluorescent sensors for free chlorine, the present methodology has a comparable detection limit of 0.04 mu M (S/N = 3) and a wide detection range of 0.05 to 15 mu M. On the other hand, the traditional redox-based fluorescent probes sharply suffered from the interference of MnO4-, Cr2O72-, and other oxidants with stronger oxidation capability than free chlorine while ours overcame this disadvantage. Further research suggests that it is more likely the energy transfer through. N-H center dot center dot center dot O-Cl hydrogen bonding interaction between amino group and ClO- ions plays the key role in our system, providing a new and promising platform for free chlorine determination in water quality monitoring.

J	Bhaduri, B; Verma, N				Bhaduri, Bhaskar; Verma, Nishith			Carbon bead-supported nitrogen-enriched and Cu-doped carbon nanofibers for the abatement of NO emissions by reduction	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were grown over highly porous (similar to 1750 m(2)/g-surface area) carbon beads (similar to 0.8 mm), using catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The carbon beads were produced by the pre-oxidation, carbonization and activation of the phenolic beads that were synthesized using the suspension polymerization. The beads were doped in situ with copper (Cu) during the polymerization reaction. The carbon beads decorated with the CNFs were treated with pyridine to increase the nitrogen (N) contents of the material. The N-enriched CNFs and Cu nanoparticles (NPs)-doped carbon beads (N-Cu-CNFICBs) were used for the removal of nitric oxide (NO) by reduction. In its dual role, Cu catalyzed the growth of the CNFs during CVD, and also, the reduction reaction. Approximately 86% of NO conversion was achieved for 400 ppm-NO concentration over 1 g of the prepared catalyst at 500 degrees C. The high catalytic activity was attributed to the combined roles of the Cu NPs, reactive CNFs and N-containing surface functional groups in the material. The prepared carbon bead-supported CNFs in this study are for the first time effectively used as the catalyst for the NO reduction without requiring ammonia or urea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we were intrigued to observe that a multipoint hydrogen bonding scheme provided by embarked urea groups could also shift the redox activation step of CO2 from the well-admitted Fe(0) to the Fe(I) state. Using EPR, resonance Raman, IR and UV-Visible spectroscopies, we underpinned a two-electron activation step of CO2 starting from the Fe(I) oxidation state to form, after protonation, an Fe(III)-COOH species. The addition of another electron and a proton to the latter species converged to the cleavage of a C-O bond with the loss of water molecule resulting in an Fe(II)-CO species. DFT analyses of these postulated intermediates are in good agreement with our collected spectroscopic data, allowing us to propose an alternative pathway in the catalytic CO2 reduction with iron porphyrin catalyst. Such a remarkable shift opens new lines of research in the design of molecular catalysts to reach low overpotentials in performing multi-electronic CO2 reduction catalysis.

The as-grown seed crystals from solution with dominant (100) and (001) facets are utilized to trigger the directional solidification. For successive growth, initial measurements of the furnace temperature distribution, heat flow structure, and solidification temperature of ABP in correlation with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis are made. The controlled diffusion is ensured by monitoring the interfacial layer between the melt and the growing crystal and is maintained by optimizing the melt temperature and pulling and rotation rates. Color change of the melt due to thermal-oxidation is prevented by appropriate control of the growth environment. A slow and steady growth rate affirms the good quality of the ABP single crystal. The anisotropic growth behavior of ABP from solution and melt is reported. Internal molecular structure, crystalline purity, molecular vibrational modes, optical transmission, and thermal behavior are studied using single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, FTIR, UV-vis-NIR and DSC analyses. The obtained higher SHG efficiency of the grown ABP in comparison with that of the organic and inorganic standards urea and KDP reveals its suitability for SHG applications.

The Impact of the hAPP695<SUP>SW</SUP> Transgene and Associated Amyloid-β Accumulation on Murine Hippocampal Biochemical Pathways	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE												Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide in the brain. Objective: To gain a better insight into alterations in major biochemical pathways underlying AD. Methods: We compared metabolomic profiles of hippocampal tissue of 20-month-old female Tg2576 mice expressing the familial AD-associated hAPP695(SW) transgene with their 20-month-old wild type female littermates. Results: The hAPP695(SW) transgene causes overproduction and accumulation of A beta in the brain. Out of 180 annotated metabolites, 54 metabolites differed (30 higher and 24 lower in Tg2576 versus wild-type hippocampal tissue) and were linked to the amino acid, nucleic acid, glycerophospholipid, ceramide, and fatty acid metabolism. Our results point to 1) heightened metabolic activity as indicated by higher levels of urea, enhanced fatty acid beta-oxidation, and lower fatty acid levels; 2) enhanced redox regulation; and 3) an imbalance of neuro-excitatory and neuro-inhibitory metabolites in hippocampal tissue of aged hAPP695(SW )transgenic mice. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that dysregulation of multiple metabolic pathways associated with a concomitant shift to an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance are contributing mechanisms of AD-related pathology in the Tg2576 mouse.																			1387-2877	1875-8908					2022	85	4					1601	1619		10.3233/JAD-215084	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-215084								34958022					WOS:000759157200018

Herein, we reported novel ultrathin tantalum disulfide nanosheets (TaS2 NSs) prepared by electrochemically exfoliating bulk TaS2 with an alternating voltage in an acidic electrolyte. The obtained TaS2 NS electrocatalyst possessed an ultrathin structure with a lateral size of 2 mu m and a thickness of similar to 3 nm. Owing to the unique 2D structure, the achieved TaS2 NSs displayed remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the HER by a small overpotential of 197 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 100 mV dec(-1) in acidic solution, much lower than those of TaS2 (>547 mV and 216 mV dec(-1), respectively) and other reported TaS2-based HER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, highly efficient full water splitting could be realized with two electrodes in which TaS2 NSs acted as the cathode while Ir/C served as the anode, with help of two AA size batteries or solar cells. By replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), bifunctional TaS2 NSs enabled an energy-effective HER process in the cathode and UOR process in the anode with decreased applied potential.

At the same sulfuric acid hydrolysis conditions (65% H2SO4, 60 degrees C and 30 min), MDF cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were produced at 27.5% yield, similar to 27.4% of CNC yield from eucalyptus with UF resin, but less than 31.2% yield from eucalyptus. MDF CNCs were slightly thicker in lateral dimension (16.8 +/- 8.6nm), less crystalline (59% CrI), and surface esterificated (0.045 mmol/g sulfate/CNC) than eucalyptus CNCs (11.6 +/- 3.9 nm, 75% CrI, 0.060 mmol/g) and CNCs from eucalyptus with UF resin (14.9 +/- 9.1 nm, 65% CrI, 0.046 mmol/g). All CNCs were free of UF resin and thermal stable. The residual resin in cellulose pulps hydrolyzed completely during the sulfuric acid treatment and contributed to the unique properties of CNCs. Therefore, CNCs derived from MDF are comparable to CNC from wood and promising for expanded applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased oxidative stress is a well described feature of patients in hemodialysis. Their need for multiple blood transfusions and supplemental iron causes a significant iron overload that has recently been associated with increased oxidation of polyunsaturated lipids and accelerated aging due to DNA damage caused by telomere shortening. Methods. A total of 70 patients were evaluated concomitantly, 35 volunteers with ferritin levels below 500 ng/mL (Group A) and 35 volunteers with ferritin levels higher than 500 ng/mL (Group B). A sample of venous blood was taken to extract DNA from leukocytes and to measure relative telomere length by real-time PCR. Results. Patients in Group B had significantly higher plasma TBARS (p = 0.008), carbonyls (p = 0.0004), and urea (p = 0.02) compared with those in Group A. Telomeres were significantly shorter in Group B, 0.66 (SD, 0.051), compared with 0.75 (SD, 0.155) in Group A (p = 0.0017). We observed a statistically significant association between relative telomere length and ferritin levels (r = -0.37,p = 0.001). Relative telomere length was inversely related to time on hemodialysis (r = -0.27,p = 0.02). Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that iron overload was associated with increased levels of oxidative stress and shorter relative telomere length.

Existing methods lack sensitivity, speed, or affordability for point-of-care diagnosis. This work addresses this by creating a novel sensor for rapid, sensitive uremic toxin detection. Methods: The sensor leverages the combined effects of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and electrochemistry (EC) for superior detection. The LIG substrate provides a stable platform for AuNPs, facilitating interaction with target molecules. Additionally, electrochemical deposition optimizes the sensor's sensitivity by amplifying the local electromagnetic field around AuNPs and offering specific binding sites for uremic toxins. Significant findings: The developed sensor demonstrates exceptional performance in detecting uremic toxins. It achieves remarkably low detection limits (10-3-3 M for creatinine/uric acid, 10-4-4 M for urea) and offers distinct, concentration-dependent responses for different toxins in cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Furthermore, characteristic oxidation peaks at specific potentials allow for direct identification and quantification of the toxins. These findings highlight the immense potential of this cost-effective and scalable sensor for point-of-care diagnostics and remote monitoring of kidney function. This advancement can significantly improve patient care by facilitating early detection of kidney problems and enabling timely intervention.

In this work, we propose a novel methodology to significantly extend the stability of CO2 adsorbents. By copolymerizing water-in-oil emulsion containing multiple acrylates with rich epoxide groups, we synthesize porous beads with a hydrophobic and robust framework to ensure long-term thermal and hydrothermal stabilities. We then graft tetraethylenepentamine on the framework via ring-opening reaction between the epoxide and amine groups to resist amine leaching and oxidation. Finally, we convert most of the remaining primary amines and some secondary amines of the grafted tetraethylenepentamine to secondary and tertiary ones through epoxide-functionalization to prevent urea formation and sulfur poisoning. With a nitrogen content of 10.0 mmol-g(-1), the adsorbent achieves 2.03 mmol-g(-1) CO2 uptake at 60 degrees C and, which remains constant when exposed to air at 90 degrees C for 12 h. After 1000 adsorption/desorption cycles, its adsorption capacity drops by 9.8% in a simulated flue gas containing O-2, SO2, and water steam, showing a long-term lifespan in a complex environment.

Sporidiobolus pararoseus is reported to exhibit enhanced anti-oxidation properties. However, its role in DN remains obscure. This study aimed to determine the antioxidative effects of a Sporidiobolus pararoseus wall-broken powder (SPP) supplement on DN and investigate the possible underlying mechanisms. A model of T2DM was successfully established, and C57BL/6J male mice were fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks and then injected with streptozotocin (100 mg per kg per day) for three consecutive days. After eight weeks of intervention, SPP strongly lowered fasting glucose levels, serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, urinary albumin and reduced glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial matrix expansion. In addition, SPP increased the activities of SOD, T-AOC, CAT, and GST and decreased the amount of MDA. Furthermore, it was revealed that SPP significantly abrogated oxidative stress not only by activating the Nrf2 gene but also by activating two Nrf2-targeted antioxidative genes (NQO-1 and HO-1) compared with metformin hydrochloride, which is widely accepted as a diabetes drug. Our study showed that SPP has antioxidant properties and delays the progression of DN; the underlying mechanism may be associated with activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway.

The structure, morphology and oxidation state of the catalysts are systematically studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, high resolution transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A nearly 4-electron assisted oxygen reduction is followed by ZnCo2O4 with onset potential at 0.81 V (vs. RHE). However, when the ZnCo2O4 flowers are embedded onto the RGO sheet, a nearly 4-electron pathway for oxygen reduction is achieved with onset potential at 0.95 V (vs. RHE). The formation of H2O2 is significantly reduced in RGO-ZnCo2O4 than bare ZnCo2O4 as detected at the tip in the scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) during electrochemical reduction. The oxygen evolution study revealed that the overpotential of 0.30 V (vs. RHE) is required in RGO-ZnCo2O4 for overcoming the benchmark current density (10 mA/cm(2)). The SECM study enables to detect local depletion of oxygen at the SECM tip during the redox transition facilitating the in-situ observation of the initial steps of OER.

To test their efficacy, two wastewater solutions were selected, i.e. inorganic: sulfide-laden wastewater, S2- concentration = 250 mg/L and organic: phenolic wastewater (phenol and o-cresol with total phenolic concentration = 1500 mg/L). The fresh catalyst samples were characterized for particle size distribution using sieves (25-125 A mu m), transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, BET surface area and ICP-AES. The recovered catalysts were also subjected to different analyses to understand the changes in the catalyst during reaction. Maximum oxidation of sulfide and phenolic compounds occurred with H2O2 in the presence of the catalyst prepared by SC method. This method also resulted in the most stable catalyst showing low amount of active metal leaching (Cu = 2% and Ce = 0.2%) as compared to COP (25.8, 7.0%), SG (38.3, 31.3%) and UG (39.6, 26.5%) methods, for which Cu and Ce leaching were similar to 26-40 and 7-31%, respectively.

Choline chloride (ChCI) was chosen as typical HBA, and polyethylene glycol (PEG), 1,3-butyleneglycol (BG), ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (GI), propionate (Pr), malonic acid (MA) and urea (U) were chosen as HBDs. The extraction and catalytic oxidative desulfurization (ECODS) system was evaluated with phosphotungstic acid (HPW) as catalyst and 30 wt% H2O2 as oxidant. Among all the neutral, acid and basic DESs, choline chloride/2-polyethylene glycol (ChCl/2PEG) showed the best performance and 99.1% of dibenzothiophene (DBT) could be eliminated from model oil at 50 degrees C within 3 h. Interestingly, the volume ratio of DES to model oil was just 1:10, which was much less than the amount of extractant in the literature. The gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC MS) analysis demonstrated that,DBT sulfoxide (DBTO) and sulfone (DBTO2) were the products of oxidation of DBT. The desulfurization efficiency of the five sulfides in ECODS system occured in the following order: DBT > 4-MDBT > 4,6-DMDBT >3-MBT >BT. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Quercetin was observed to repair kidney damage through the TLR4/TRIM32 pathway, and the detoxification effect of quercetin on heavy metal poisoning was observed. Methods: For the study, the researchers divided 40 male mice from the KM strain into five groups: control, HgCl2, QU30, HgCl2+QU15, and HgCl2+QU30. The biological effects of those mice in each group were detected by the biochemical experiment, histopathology experiment and protein expression experiment respectively. Results: HgCl2 had effects in increasing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes (P < 0.05). HgCl2 induced inflammation by increasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR-4) (P < 0.05). The expression of creatinine (CRE) and urea nitrogen (BUN) showed that HgCl2 promoted kidney injury. HgCl2 altered renal tissue integrity and TRIM32 expression which resulted in the increased autophagy associated protein levels of LC3. In contrast, quercetin reduced oxidative stress, autophagy, inflammation and histopathological changes (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Quercetin has the renal protection effects of anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-autophagy.

The effect of fuel type on structure and catalytic methanation performance over Ni-Al2O3 catalysts in a slurry-bed reactor was studied. The results show that Ni-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared by impregnation combustion method using urea, glycine or ethylene glycol as fuel, exhibited similar textural properties, metallic Ni dispersion and Ni crystallite size as those of the support, and the CO conversion was between 80. 1% and 83. 5% at 260 degrees C. However, the Ni-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared by co-combustion method, were significantly affected by the combustion process. The specific surface area of the catalysts prepared using glycine and ethylene glycol as fuel was small, and the metallic Ni dispersion was low and Ni crystallite size was large, which resulted in the low CO conversion. The Ni-Al2O3 catalyst using urea as fuel exhibited the large specific surface area and metallic Ni dispersion and small Ni crystallite size, and the CO conversion and CH4 selectivity reached 84. 7% and 91. 1%, respectively.

Aerosol sampling was conducted over an offshore island in the East China Sea in four seasons of 2019, aiming to reveal the seasonal sources and secondary formation processes of marine WSON. The annual mean WSON concentration reached 1.05 +/- 1.72 mu g/m3 with a mean WSON/WSTN fraction of 27 %. In spring, WSON was associated with combustion emissions. The liquid-phase reaction of NH3/NH4+ with VOCs was a po-tential secondary formation process of WSON. In summer, WSON was mainly formed through the gaseous phase oxidation of marine biogenic precursors. In autumn, WSON showed miscellaneous sources from agricultural activities, biomass burn-ing, and fossil fuel combustion. In addition to the contribution from primary urea, WSON could be also affected by the ox-idation of biological proteinaceous matters. This explained the highest WSON concentrations and WSON/WSOC ratios in autumn. In winter, WSON was probably emitted from sea spray aerosols via the bubble-bursting processes. This study in-dicated that the sources of WSON over the coastal waters in the East China Sea were quite diverse, highlighting the need of more detailed characterization of marine WSON at the molecular level.

However, the effects of the exfoliation method on the microstructure and photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 nanosheets remain largely unknown. Herein, several typical strategies, such as thermal, chemical, ultrasonic and one-step exfoliation, were applied to exfoliate g-C3N4 nanosheets for photocatalytic applications. A procedure capable of controlling the morphology, microstructure, light-absorption property, and visible light photoactivity of g-C(3)N(4 )nanosheets was attempted. We found that nanosheets prepared from one-step exfoliation present superior photocatalytic efficiency under visible light than those fabricated by thermal exfoliation and ultrasonic exfoliation. The kinetic constants for bisphenol A (BPA) photodegradation over these samples were determined to be 6.5, 4.5 and 2.3 times higher than bulk g-C3N4, respectively. For chemical exfoliation, excessive oxidation by H2SO4 can lead to the structural defects and deactivation of urea-derived g-C3N4 nanosheets. Carbon nitride nanosheets synthesized by one-step exfoliation exhibited high specific surface area, optimal band gap energy structure, and high charge separation efficiency, thereby increasing visible-light photoactivity. Enabling cost-effective production of ultrathin and robust g-C3N4 nanosheets, one-step exfoliation offers a potential strategy to exploit high-performance g-C3N4 for water purification applications.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				FEB 15	2022	424		B						127424	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127424		OCT 2021						34634708					WOS:000711844900002

A debate has been raised about the particular role of hypoxia-inducible factor (HF-1 alpha) in the renal injury pathogenesis and the renal cortex ultrastructural alterations. Also, we investigated the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effect of thymoquinone and its modulatory role on HIF-1 alpha in protection against renal IRI. Adult male Wister albino rats were assigned into 3 groups (n=16); 1) Sham-operated, 2) IRI model and 3) renal IRI pre-treated with thymoquinone 10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) (TQ-IRI) for 10 days and at the reperfusion onset. Following the operation, 8 rats from each group were euthanized after 3 hours and the remaining 8 rats at 24 hours. Renal injury was assessed by the increased blood urea nitrogen, creatinine level, and the EGTI histological injury scoreat both 3 and 24h. HIF-1 alpha was upregulated (p<0.01) and was correlated with renal tissue reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and total oxidant capacity (TAC) consumption. Elevated inflammatory markers (NFkB, MCP-1 and VCAM-1) were associated with renal IRI. Thymoquinone treatment inhibited the accumulation of HIF-1 alpha (p<0.01), reduced renal oxidation/inflammation process and markedly diminished renal injury.

Effect of nitric oxide on the formation of cobalt-aluminum oxide structure from layered double hydroxide and its further transformation during reductive activation	APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL												The presence of nitric oxide NO in the gas phase was shown to decrease the decomposition rate of the hydrotalcite-like Co-Al LDH phase in the catalysts prepared by co-precipitation or deposition on Al2O3 under the condition of urea hydrolysis. The decrease in LDH decomposition rate is related to the formation of a more crystallized phase of the spinel-like Co-Al oxide due to the ability of nitric oxide to transfer oxygen in consecutive reactions of the oxidation to NO2 and reduction to NO. The difference in the coherent scattering domain size of the catalyst samples precalcined in the presence of NO or in a pure inert gas is retained at all consecutive steps of the reductive heat treatment in hydrogen: after the formation of a cubic phase of the (Co, Al)O oxide and its reduction to metallic cobalt. The observed changes in the degree of crystallinity and dispersion of the active metal exert only a slight effect or even no effect on the activity of the catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Noteworthy are a lower selectivity for methane and a greater fraction of olefins in the products obtained on the catalysts precalcined in a flow of inert gas containing 3% NO. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the pathogenesis of gout is still unclear, and novel biomarkers are demanded for the early prediction and diagnosis of gout. Objective This study aimed at profiling the dysregulated metabolic pathways in asymptomatic hyperuricemia (AHU) and gout and elucidating the associations between AHU, gout and metabolomics, which may aid in performing gout screening. Methods A total of 300 participants, including 114 healthy controls, 92 patients with AHU, and 94 patients with gout, were analyzed by using a combination of dried blood spot (DBS) sampling and mass spectrometry (MS) technology. Multiple algorithms were applied to characterize altered metabolic profiles in AHU and gout. The mainly altered metabolites were identified by random forest analysis. Results There were significant differences in AHU and gout compared with control group. The altered metabolites were involved in oxidation of fatty acids, carnitine synthesis, urea cycle, and amino acid metabolism in AHU and gout. Random forest classification of 16 metabolites yielded 3 important features to distinguish gout from AHU. Conclusions Distinct metabolomic signatures were observed in AHU and gout. The selected metabolites may have the potential to improve the early detection of gout.

APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												The aim of this study was to isolate, characterize, and verify possible antibacterial and hemolytic activity for a lectin found in the seeds of Sterculia foetida L. Purification of the lectin from S. foetida (SFL) was realized with ion exchange chromatography DEAE-Sephacel coupled to HPLC. The purity and the molecular weight was determined by SDS-PAGE. The isolated SFL was characterized as to its glycoprotein nature, and sugar specificity, as well as resistance to pH, temperature, denaturing agents, reduction, oxidation, and chelation. A microdilution method was used to determine antibacterial activity, and hemolytic activity was observed in human erythrocytes. The SFL has a molecular weight of 17 kDa, and a carbohydrate content of 53 mu g/mL, specific for arabinose and xylose, and is resistant to treatment with urea, sensitive to treatment with sodium metaperiodate and beta-mercaptoethanol, and in the presence of EDTA lost its hemagglutinating activity (HA). However, in the presence of divalent cations (Ca2 + and Mn2 +) the HA was increased. The SFL remained active even after incubation at 80 A degrees C, and, within pH values of between 5 and 11. The SFL inhibited the bacterial growth of all the tested strains and caused little hemolysis in human erythrocytes when compared to the positive control Triton X-100.

The crystalline structure of GO was revealed by the XRD intense peak recorded at 2 theta = 11.4 degrees, indicating that the interlayer distance within the structure was large (d = 0.77 nm), and the number of layers (n) was 9. Further, the transformation of GO in NGr also led to the decrease in the interlayer distance and number of layers (d = 0.387 nm; n = 3). As indicated by elemental analysis, the concentration of nitrogen in the NGr sample was 6 wt%. Next, the comparison between the performance of bare GC and the graphene-modified electrode (NGr /GC) towards piroxicam (PIR) detection was studied. Significant differences were observed between the two electrodes. Hence, in the case of bare GC, the oxidation signal of PIR was very broad and appeared at a high potential (+0.7 V). In contrast, the signal recorded with the NGr /GC electrode was significantly higher (four times) and shifted towards lower potentials (+0.54 V), proving the electro-catalytic effect of nitrogen-doped graphene. The NGr /GC electrode was also tested for its ability to detect piroxicam in pharmaceutical drugs (Flamexin), giving excellent recoveries.

For this purpose, a polypyrrolepolyvinylsulfonate film was prepared by electropolymerization of pyrrole in a polyvinylsulfonate medium on a platinum plate. Creatinase and sarcosine oxidase enzymes were immobilized on polypyrrole-polyvinylsulfonate film by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The determination of creatinine was made based on the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide at 0.4 V formed as a result of the enzymatic reaction on the surface of the prepared biosensor. The linear working range of the biosensor obtained was found between 5.0 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-4) M. Using this linear graph, the Km (observed) and Imax (observed) values for the double enzyme electrode system were calculated as 5.0 x 10(-3) mM and 0.34 mu A/min, respectively. Optimum working pH and temperature were determined as 8.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The reusability and shelf life of the biosensor were determined. The effects of interferences in biological environments on biosensor response were investigated. For this purpose, uric acid, ascorbic acid, paracetamol, glycine, urea, and formaldehyde were used. The results have shown that the prepared biosensor has the potential to be used for creatinine determination in biological fluids.

The prepared catalysts were characterized by SEM, TEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis, XPS, XRD, and FTIR, which proved that the modification method successfully introduced the C bridge into the carbon nitride molecular system and increased the structural defects of the catalyst. The Carbon-bridge-modified MLD/CN/Fe3O4 also had good visible-light response and charge-separation and transport abilities in the photo-electrochemical test. Degradation results showed that the photo-Fenton degradation of TC reached 95.8%, and the mineralization rate was 55.7% within 80 min at 80 mM H2O2 dosage, 0.5 g/L catalyst dosage, and near-neutral pH by 0.8MLD/CN/Fe3O4. Moreover, the oxidation products and mineralization pathways of TC were explored by LC-MS. Toxicity analysis indicated low environmental threat of the intermediates in TC minerali-zation.

Basic polypeptide (poly-(L)-lysine)-templated precipitation of silica synthesized by sol-gel chemistry produced a composite material that allows high enzyme activity. This study investigates the structural properties of the composite material that allow retaining the glucose oxidase (GOx) activity. Scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopies reveal that the composite has plate- or sheet-type morphologies composed of hexagonal structures that are 0.2-2 mu m in diameter. After the encapsulation in a sol-gel silica matrix, encapsulated GOx retained high activity (over 85% of oxidation activity compared with that of free GOx). The relative activity of GOx-encapsulated in SiO2@pLys remained approximately at 50-60% after eight cycles; in addition, the catalytic stability of encapsulated GOx improved under high temperature (60 degrees C) and in several solvents (e.g., HCl, urea, and acetone). Moreover, (D)-glucose detection was performed in the linear range of 1-400 mu M using SiO2@pLys-GOx composites. The obtained results show that SiO2@pLys-GOx composites can be used for enzyme encapsulation with high activity and stability and as biosensor materials with high sensitivity. [GRAPHICS] .

This metabolite GWAS (mGWAS) aimed to identify the key metabolites and metabolic pathways regulated by these genes. Potential metabolic pathways associated with leanness and obesity were identified by detecting metabolites in association with GWAS. Waist circumference, lean body mass, and body fat mass were strongly associated with BMI rather than BMR. However, plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol were significantly higher in obese individuals with low BMR than in lean individuals with high BMR. Upon analyzing NRG3, BCL2L2-PABPN1, and SLC22A17, uric acid, succinic acid, arginine, uridine, and aspartic acid were the metabolites positively associated with obesity. Uric acid and arginine were both identified through general metabolomics targeting of obesity genes classified on the basis of BMI or BMR. Metabolites associated with disruption in beta-oxidation, lipid metabolism, branched-chain amino acid and aromatic amino acid catabolism, the urea cycle, and purine/pyrimidine metabolism play important roles in obesity classified on the basis of either BMI or BMR in middle-aged Korean women. These results further the current understanding of obesity and the predictability of obesity-related risks using mGWAS.

An abundant bacterial phylum with nitrite-oxidizing potential in oligotrophic marine sediments	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY												Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are important nitrifiers whose activity regulates the availability of nitrite and dictates the magnitude of nitrogen loss in ecosystems. In oxic marine sediments, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and NOB together catalyze the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate, but the abundance ratios of AOA to canonical NOB in some cores are significantly higher than the theoretical ratio range predicted from physiological traits of AOA and NOB characterized under realistic ocean conditions, indicating that some NOBs are yet to be discovered. Here we report a bacterial phylum Candidatus Nitrosediminicolota, members of which are more abundant than canonical NOBs and are widespread across global oligotrophic sediments. Ca. Nitrosediminicolota members have the functional potential to oxidize nitrite, in addition to other accessory functions such as urea hydrolysis and thiosulfate reduction. While one recovered species (Ca. Nitrosediminicola aerophilus) is generally confined within the oxic zone, another (Ca. Nitrosediminicola anaerotolerans) additionally appears in anoxic sediments. Counting Ca. Nitrosediminicolota as a nitrite-oxidizer helps to resolve the apparent abundance imbalance between AOA and NOB in oxic marine sediments, and thus its activity may exert controls on the nitrite budget. A novel phylum of bacteria widespread in oligotrophic marine sediments are capable of oxidizing nitrite to nitrate and could resolve the apparent abundance mismatch between ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizers.

Simple Melatonin Determination Using Disposable and Low-Cost Lab-Made Screen-Printed Carbon Electrode	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY												This work describes the preparation and application of a screen-printed electrode (SPE) for direct melatonin (MT) determination in samples of saliva and urine. The low-cost SPE was obtained using a simple and feasible 2D printing methodology and a lab-made conductive ink based on graphite powder and colorless nail polish. The proposed electrode showed similar electrochemical performance compared to a commercial SPE towards melatonin oxidation. Based on electrooxidation of melatonin recorded at +0.62 V an electroanalytical method was developed using the lab-made SPE under square wave voltammetric conditions. Repeatability and reproducibility studies showed that the relative peak current values did not show significant differences between them. Under optimized parameters inherent to the methodology and voltammetric technique, the proposed SPE presented a linear dynamic range (LDR) between 0.25 to 75.0 mu mol L-1 (R2 = 0.99), and calculated limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 25.8 and 83.3 nmol L-1, respectively, were obtained. The effect of other biologically relevant compounds such as glucose, urea, and estradiol was investigated, and non-significative signal interference was observed. The method proposed was successfully applied to MT determination in spiked samples providing good recovery values between 95.6 to 104%.

The rGO-Nf@ Au nanohybrid was synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The spherical AuNP have diameters in the range from 50 to 200 nm as proven by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with the nanohybrid displays excellent electrocatalytic activity towards NO oxidation compared to other kinds of modified electrodes. Best operated at a voltage of + 0.8 V (vs. SCE), the amperometric response was linear in the 1 mu M to 0.16 mM nitrite concentration range, with 0.5 mu M detection limit (at an S/N ratio of 3). The high surface area of the AuNP along with the synergistic effect of AuNP and rGO- Nf film on the signal current is believed to cause the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the nanohybrid. The sensor is not interfered by dopamine (DA), ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), glucose, urea, and NaCl even in 5-fold higher concentrations. In our perception, the rGO-Nf@ Au modified electrode is a promising tool for highly sensitive and selective amperometric sensing of NO.

Metal oxyhydroxides have emerged as viable alternative catalysts as compared to the precious metalbased commercial benchmarks. Yet, the activity may be compromised by the instability of the layered structures. Herein, a simple two-step method is developed for the synthesis of Co-FeOOH electrocatalysts by thermal treatment of cobalt-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-L) deposited on the skeleton of NF (nickel foam) in the presence of FeSO4 and urea. Co-FeOOH/NF, the thin nanosheet arrays exhibit a high specific surface area and high hydrophobicity. The addition of Co regulates the electronic environment around the Fe center, which optimizes the adsorption energy of intermediates and enhances the inherent OER activity of active sites. The Co-FeOOH nanoarrays show excellent OER performance and 99.7% Faradaic efficiency (FE). At current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm- 2, there is a low overpotential of 208 and 249 mV, respectively at 1 M KOH. This kind of synthesis method will provide a promising approach for the construction of catalysts featuring stable structures for alkaline water oxidation.

In this study, nitrogen and urea solutions are used as the gas-liquid phases of the atomization medium. ANSYS simulation software was used to simulate and analyze the interpolar pressure and flow field of the different electrodes. The effect of different electrode forms on the EDM surface modification layer was investigated by designing comparative trials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and other detection methods were used to characterize the process indicators, such as surface morphology, roughness, hardness, and wear resistance of the reinforced layer. It was found that a thick and uniform continuous layer can be obtained on the Ti-6Al-4V alloy substrate using multi-channel electrode machining, and the thickness is about 65 mu m. XRD analysis indicates that the reinforced layer mainly contains TiN, Ti2N, Ti2AlN, Ti2O, and CuO phases. The samples with reinforced layers were shown to have higher hardness (1578 HV) and better wear resistance than the titanium substrates. The main wear mechanism is spalling wear and light oxidation wear.

A previous study reported that MaR1 could suppress MSU crystal-induced peritonitis in mice. To date, the molecular mechanism by which MaR1 inhibits MSU crystal-induced inflammation remains poorly understood.MethodsMousebone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were pretreated with MaR1 and then stimulated with FAs (palmitic, C16:0 and stearic, C18:0) plus MSU crystals (FAs + MSUc). In vivo, the effects of MaR1 treatment or Prdx5 deficiency on MSUc induced peritonitis and arthritis mouse models were evaluated.ResultsThe current study indicated that MaR1 effectively suppressed MSUc induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo. MaR1 reversed the decrease in Prdx5 mRNA and protein levels induced by FAs + MSUc. Further assays demonstrated that MaR1 acceleratedPrdx5 expression by regulating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling axis. Activation of AMPK by Prdx5 improved homeostasis of the TXNIP and TRX proteins and alleviated mitochondrial fragmentation. In addition, Prdx5 overexpression inhibited the expression of CPT1A, a key enzyme for fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Prdx5 protected against defects in FA + MSUc induced FAO and the urea cycle.ConclusionMaR1 treatment effectively attenuated MSUc induced inflammation by upregulating Prdx5 expression. Our study provides a new strategy by which Prdx5 may help prevent acute gout attacks.					zhang, zhaoxiao/IZE-3932-2023														1076-1551	1528-3658				NOV 23	2023	29	1							158	10.1186/s10020-023-00756-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10020-023-00756-w								37996809					WOS:001107226600002

Energy-level engineering of carbon dots through a post-synthetic treatment with acids and amines	NANOSCALE												Chemically synthesized carbon dots (CDs) have attracted a lot of attention as an eco-friendly and cost-efficient light-emitting material, and functionalization of CD surfaces with additives of different natures is a useful way to control their properties. In this study, we show how a post-synthetic treatment of CDs with citric acid, benzoic acid, urea and o-phenylenediamine changes their chemical composition and optical properties. In particular, it results in the formation of carboxyl/imide/carbonyl groups at the CD surface, leading to the appearance of additional blue (or for CDs treated with phenylenediamine, blue and green) emissive optical centers on top of the remaining emission from the original CDs. Most importantly, the increased oxidation degree alongside a decreased relative amount of carbon and nitrogen in such treated CDs decreases their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level by up to 0.9 eV (the maximal value was observed for CDs treated with o-phenylenediamine). Moreover, the Fermi energy level shifted above the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level for some of the treated CD samples. Thus, the energy structure of CDs can be tuned and optimized for further applications through the functionalization of their surface with organic additives.

The effect of the pyrolysis temperature on morphology, crystal structure and glucose-sensing performance of the composite materials was investigated in detail. The kinetic analysis demonstrated high electrocatalytic activity (K-cat, 2.09 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)) for glucose oxidation on the obtained electrode materials. The constructed Ni-MOF400 sensors displayed ultra-high sensitivity (2918.2 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)) for non-enzymatic glucose sensing with a relatively wide detection linear range (5 mu M-4.1 mM) and low detection limit (0.92 mu M). The high glucose sensing performance may be due to the greatly reduced charge transfer resistance (0.412 k omega for Ni-MOF400 vs 19.27 k omega for Ni-MOF800) originating from the synergistic effect of highly dispersed NiO nanoparticles and porous carbons. Moreover, the sensors also presented good selectivity in the presence of various interferents (l-lysine, urea, l-leucine, ascorbic acid, l-valine, NaCl, l-glutamic, and l-proline). The reasonable analytical recovery ranging from 103 to 108.1% for the glucose detection in bovine serum was also obtained, suggesting the preferable feasibility of the Ni-MOF400 sensors for the real sample analysis.

Uncultivated lineages of these picocyanobacteria also thrive in the dimly illuminated upper part of oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs), where an important portion of ocean nitrogen (N) loss takes place via denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation. Recent metagenomic studies revealed that ODZ Prochlorococcus have the genetic potential for using different N forms, including nitrate and nitrite, uncommon N sources for Prochlorococcus, but common for Synechococcus. To determine which N sources ODZ picocyanobacteria are actually using in nature, the cellular N-15 natural abundance (delta N-15) and assimilation rates of different N compounds were determined using cell sorting by flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. The natural delta N-15 of the ODZ Prochlorococcus varied from -4.0 parts per thousand to 13.0 parts per thousand (n = 9), with 50% of the values in the range of -2.1-2.6 parts per thousand. While the highest values suggest nitrate use, most observations indicate the use of nitrite, ammonium, or a mixture of N sources. Meanwhile, incubation experiments revealed potential assimilation rates of ammonium and urea in the same order of magnitude as that expected for total N in several environments including ODZs, whereas rates of nitrite and nitrate assimilation were very low. Our results thus indicate that reduced forms of N and nitrite are the dominant sources for ODZ picocyanobacteria, although nitrate might be important on some occasions. ODZ picocyanobacteria might thus represent potential competitors with anammox bacteria for ammonium and nitrite, with ammonia-oxidizing archaea for ammonium, and with nitrite-oxidizing bacteria for nitrite.					von Dassow, Peter/JXW-7856-2024; Aldunate, Montserrat/HTS-7371-2023; Henríquez-Castillo, Carlos/AAD-5902-2022; Ulloa, Osvaldo/E-1821-2011; Mulholland, Margaret/E-8480-2011	Ulloa, Osvaldo/0000-0002-9501-5576; Lueders-Dumont, Jessica/0000-0002-1088-8766; Henriquez-Castillo, Carlos/0000-0001-7763-8350; Ward, Bess/0000-0001-7870-2684; Mulholland, Margaret/0000-0001-8819-189X; Aldunate, Montserrat/0000-0002-9927-3118; von Dassow, Peter/0000-0002-1858-1953; Ji, Qixing/0000-0003-2950-6569													0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2020	65	2					437	453		10.1002/lno.11315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11315		SEP 2019											WOS:000486668500001

(Maca) on preventing mitochondria-mediated muscle damage and oxidative stress in vivo and vitro	FOOD & FUNCTION												Maca (Lepidium meyenii Walp.) has emerged as a popular functional plant food due to its various pharmacological properties, including anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and anti-fatigue activity. In this study, we investigated the role of Maca aqueous extract (ME) on muscle during exercise-induced fatigue both in vivo and in vitro. As a result, ME significantly enhanced mouse leg grip-strength and increased exercise endurance in the rota-rod test. ME could clear the accumulation of metabolites - blood lactic acid (BLA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels after weight-loaded forced swimming. Focusing on muscle, we found that the administration of ME strengthened mouse muscle structures so that exercise-induced metabolic stress was alleviated by upregulating NAD(+)/NADH. Furthermore, ME inhibited the reduction of the viability and accumulation of ROS by treatment with H2O2 in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. ME-induced activation of energy metabolism in skeletal muscle might up-regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function, thereby protecting against oxidative stress-induced damage. We concluded that the effects of Maca played a crucial role in the regulation of exercise-induced fatigue in mouse muscle, which could be expected to serve as a functional food supplement for improving exercise performance and alleviating physical fatigue.

Comparison of chemotaxonomic and physiological properties further suggested that strain EMGL16-1 was taxonomically distinct from other species in the genus Methylomonas. The isolate was versatile in utilising nitrogen sources such as molecular nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, urea, and ammonium. The genes coding for subunit of the particulate form methane monooxygenase (pmoA), soluble methane monooxygenase (mmoX), and methanol dehydrogenase (mxaF) were detected in strain EMGL16-1. Phylogenetic analysis of mmoX indicated that mmoX of strain EMGL16-1 is distinct from those of other strains in the genus Methylomonas. This isolate probably represents a novel species in the genus.

Previous studies by Wang et al. showed that acetylene (C2H2) has a high activity at low temperatures and a satisfactory intracrystalline diffusion over zeolites. The present work investigates C2H2 as a reducing agent under NO, NO2 conditions and a mixture of NO and NO2. Ferrierite zeolites loaded with iron and cobalt ions were evaluated as catalysts by InfraRed (IR) operando and in-situ techniques. This latter technique allowed a clear identification of the vibration bands of the species formed on the surface in reaction conditions. Two different sites for the localization of cations in the Ferrierite were identified from the NO experiment, with only one common to both cations. Regarding C2H2, its interaction with both Lewis and Bronsted sites could be identified. Thanks to the IR operando methodology, it was possible to identify hydrocyanic acid as a relevant intermediate species for the SCR of NOx by C2H2 over Co-HFER. Moreover, the NO oxidation to NO2 was found to be a determining step for the SCR reaction when using the Co loaded catalyst. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Citrate-stabilizing gold nanoparticle colloids (GNPs) were electrostatically adsorbed onto NDG nanosheets using a cationic polyelectrolyte, polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA), as the linker, thereby creating a high-performance electrochemical interface. The morphology and chemical composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Analytical application was manifested by electrochemical sensing of uric acid (UA), a biomarker involved with a variety of clinical diseases. The prepared nanocomposite exhibited noticeable electroactivity to uric acid oxidation and can give effective peak separation with ascorbic acid and dopamine. Additionally, the nanocomposite practically averted from other potentially interferents including glucose, urea, and serotonin, thus allowing selective voltammetric detection of UA in the biological matrix. Under the optimal condition, peak currents measured by differential pulse voltammetry were proportional to UA concentrations in the range of 0.5~100 mu M (R-2 = 0.998), with the detection limit of 53 nM. The NDG/PDDA/GNP nanocomposite as presented herein holds potential for aiding the diagnosis of UA-associated diseases and should be a new opportunity for biochemical analysis and biosensing applications.

In this study, crude macamide extract (CME) and purified macamide extract (PME) were prepared by enzyme-assisted extraction and macroporous resin separation, and the anti-fatigue effects of CME and PME were evaluated in a forced swimming model. RESULTS The composition analysis results revealed that both CME and PME mainly contain eight kinds of macamide. Based on the results of a weight-loaded forced swimming test, compared with a control group, CME and and PME groups could prolong exhaustive swimming time, increase levels of liver glycogen (LG) and muscle glycogen (MG), accelerate fatty acid oxidation in serum to provide energy, eliminate the accumulation of blood lactic acid (BLA) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and decrease the serum biomarkers for muscle damage, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK). Histological analysis also indicated that CME and PME attenuated damage to skeletal muscle and the myocardium in mice during exercise. CONCLUSION Two macamide extracts have a beneficial effect on relieving physical fatigue by attenuating the damage of skeletal muscle and myocardium during exercise, and a better effect was observed in the PME group.

Clinical laboratories performing this test for clinically suspected children at different ages are faced with the challenge of using appropriate reference ranges for the diagnostic markers. Objectives: Retrospective evaluation of laboratory data was performed to establish the disease spectrum and clinically relevant reference ranges for the diagnostic markers. Methods: The results of clinically suspected 4800 patients were extracted from laboratory information system and correlated with clinical data. Relevant reference ranges for the analytes in dried blood spots was determined using nonparametric statistical methods. Results: Forty four patients were diagnosed with 12 different inborn errors of metabolism. There were 23 patients with organic acid disorder, 13 patients with amino acid or urea cycle disorder and 8 patients with fatty acid oxidation disorder. The reference ranges were significantly different between the children under and over 1 year of age for some acylcarnitines (C0, C2, C3, C5OH, C14, C16 and C18) and amino acids (citrulline, arginine, tyrosine, valine and leucine). Conclusions: The interpretation of the Tandem MS analysis results showed that the difference in the reference ranges for children under or over one year of age did not affect the diagnosis for most frequent inborn errors of metabolism.

Structural and electrochemical performance studies for nanocomposites of carbon with Fe3C or Mn-Substituted (Fe3C/Fe3O4) as anodes for Li-batteries	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												The nanocomposites of Fe3O4 or Fe3C or Fe3O4/Fe3C with carbon are exploited as anode materials for Li-ion batteries due to their higher theoretical capacities. The present work depicts the charging capacity of nanocomposites (similar to 5-25 nm) of carbon with Fe3C or MnrFe3-rC/MnsFe3-sO4 (where 0.2 <= r + s >= 0.7). These composites are synthesized using an inexpensive urea assisted sol-gel route which are then heat treated at 700 degrees C in an inert atmosphere. The x-ray and electron diffractions validate the presence of Fe3C, Fe3O4, and carbon phases in the samples. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depicts the oxidation states for the elements of nanocomposite M7FOC. Mossbauer spectroscopy further supports the findings of earlier studies. The electrode kinetics and the electrochemical performance for the materials are assessed by Voltammograms and Galvanostatic lithiation/delithiation plots. The specific charge capacities and Coulombic efficiencies with respect to cycle numbers at room temperature are also evaluated. The optimum specific capacity of similar to 1261 mAh g(-1) is observed for M7FOC sample whereas its reversible specific lithiation capacity is found to be around 841 mAh g(-1) after the initial cycle at the rate of C/20.

Thus, it is essential to develop new technologies for reducing NOx emissions in order to contribute to the cleaner production of pellets. In this paper, NOx reduction by advanced reburning ingrate-rotary kiln for oxidized pellet production was performed on a laboratory-scale gas kiln. Temperature and NH3/NOx molar ratio (NSR) were the key factors affecting the reduction of NOx. A better denitrification effect can be obtained on flus gas with higher initial NOx concentration, at temperature = 900 degrees C, NSR = 1.2, and reaction time exceeds one second. NOx reduction rate had reached 55-65% when the initial NOx concentration was above 400 ppm, and exceeds 70% when the initial NOx concentration was around 680 ppm. Urea solution has the best denitrification effect compared with NH3 center dot H2O and NH4HCO3 solution. As for additives, the denitrification effect of the vanadium-titanium catalyst was better than that of ethanol and NaCl, while NaCl plays a promotive role at low NSR. Finally, a series of denitrification measures that include advanced reburning technology for achieving NOx ultra-low emission in the oxidation pellet production was proposed.					hu, bing/GSD-6827-2022; Junyong, Wei/AAW-5773-2021															2227-9717				NOV	2020	8	11							1470	10.3390/pr8111470	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr8111470													WOS:000593695100001
J	Duan, PP; Fan, CH; Zhang, QQ; Xiong, ZQ				Duan, Pengpeng; Fan, Changhua; Zhang, Qianqian; Xiong, Zhengqin			Overdose fertilization induced ammonia-oxidizing archaea producing nitrous oxide in intensive vegetable fields	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Little is known about the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization rates on ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and their differential contribution to nitrous oxide (N2O) production, particularly in greenhouse based high N input vegetable soils. Six N treatments (N1, N2, N3, N4, N5 and N6 representing 0, 293, 587, 880, 1173 and 1760 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) were continuously managed for three years in a typically intensified vegetable field in China. The aerobic incubation experiment involving these field-treated soils was designed to evaluate the relative contributions of AOA and AOB to N2O production by using acetylene or 1-octyne as inhibitors. The results showed that the soil pH and net nitrification rate gradually declined with increasing the fertilizer N application rates. The AOA were responsible for 44-71% of the N2O production with negligible N2O from AOB in urea unamended control soils. With urea amendment, the AOA were responsible for 48-53% of the N2O production in the excessively fertilized soils, namely the N5-N6 soils, while the AOB were responsible for 42-55% in the conventionally fertilized soils, namely the N1-N4 soils. Results indicated that overdose fertilization induced higher AOA-dependent N2O production than AOB, whereas urea supply led to higher AOB-dependent N2O production than AOA in conventionally fertilized soils. Additionally, a positive relationship existed between N2O production and NO2- accumulation during the incubation. Further mechanisms for NO2--dependent N2O production in intensive vegetable soils therefore deserve urgent attention. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Little is known about optimal dietary protein intake in humans under different physiological conditions including disease states, prompting a review of current monitoring methods by Robert Wolfe at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, USA, and co-workers. Monitoring nitrogen balance provides estimates of dietary protein and essential amino acid (EAA) levels, but requires several days of strict diet control. Various techniques monitor the uptake or fate of a specific tracer molecule in the body, but some are very invasive. The less invasive single EAA infusion methods provide rapid results and are valuable for monitoring immediate response to a meal, or in studies comparing protein intakes to a person's baseline over time. Using two methods concurrently could improve accuracy of results. There is a general consensus that a dietary protein intake of 0.8 g protein/kg/day will prevent symptoms of protein deficiency in young, healthy individuals. However, individuals in many physiological circumstances may benefit from higher rates of dietary protein intake. Stable isotope tracer methodology enables a variety of approaches to assessing the optimal dietary protein intake in humans. In this paper, we present an overview of a variety of tracer methods, with a discussion of necessary assumptions, as well as the clinical circumstances in which different methods may be preferable. Although we discuss the nontracer method of nitrogen balance, which has historically been used to estimate dietary protein requirements, this paper primarily focuses on tracer methods for estimating dietary protein and essential amino acid requirements under different physiological conditions. We will explain the following approaches: isotopic measurement of urea production; the arterial-venous tracer balance method; measurement of the fractional synthetic and breakdown rates of muscle protein; the indicator and the direct amino acid oxidation methods; and different approaches to measuring whole-body protein synthesis and breakdown. The advantages and limitations of each method are discussed in the context of the optimal approaches for use under different circumstances.

In this work, Pt/Ce0.4Zr0.5La0.05Pr0.05O2 (Pt/CZ) TWCs were prepared by two different alkali-assisted deposition precipitation method, urea or ammonia. The effects of different alkali-assisted on the physicochemical properties, catalytic activity and durability were analyzed. It was found that the Pt/CZ catalyst prepared by urea-assisted deposition precipitation method (UDP) had poor aging resistance but the Pt/CZ catalyst prepared by ammonia-assisted (ADP) showed better anti-aging ability. Based on the results of XRD, CO adsorption, XPS and H-2-TPR, comparatively larger particle size of Pt species and stronger interaction for ADP make it more difficult to sinter together during the aging treatment, which is favorable for maintaining catalytic activity. Therefore, the ADP catalyst shows a bright future for industrialization.					yuan, hang/HZJ-8353-2023														1000-324X					JUN 20	2021	36	6					659	664		10.15541/jim20200357	http://dx.doi.org/10.15541/jim20200357													WOS:000654073400013
J	Li, BT; Lin, XR; Luo, Y; Yuan, XQ; Wang, XJ				Li, Baitao; Lin, Xiaorong; Luo, Yao; Yuan, Xiaoqing; Wang, Xiujun			Design of active and stable bimodal nickel catalysts for methane reforming with CO2	FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY												Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has been investigated in numerous studies as an attractive process to produce synthesis gas. Although nonprecious-metal catalysts are widely employed in this reaction, their large scale application has been hampered due to difficulties in controlling the metal sintering and coking. The main objective of this research was to improve DRM reaction through highly active and effective nickel catalysts with bimodal structure. In this work, the effect of pore structures (nonporous, monomodal and bimodal structures) on the catalytic performance, stability and coke formation were comparatively discussed. Two series of nickel catalysts were developed by one-step and impregnation methods. By using one-step strategy, three kinds of bases (NH3 center dot H2O, Urea and NaOH) were used to prepare monomodal (Ni-SiO2-NH3 center dot H2O), bimodal (Ni-SiO2-Urea) and non-porous (Ni-SiO2-NaOH) catalysts. By using impregnation method, monomodal (Ni/M-SiO2) and bimodal (Ni/B-SiO2) catalysts were prepared. The pore structure exerted crucial effect on the catalytic performance in DRM. In comparison to monomodal catalyst, in each series bimodal nickel catalyst exhibited higher activity and more stable performance in DRM. The non-porous Ni-SiO2-NaOH exhibited inferior activity to the monomodal or bimodal catalyst due to the significant decrease in surface area. The obtained catalysts prepared by one step method contained Ni nanoparticles with diameter of 3 nm, about 1/8 of the catalysts prepared by impregnation method. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) confirmed the well-dispersed Ni particles were incorporated into the silica framework. Temperature programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also verified the strengthened interaction between Ni species and silica support. Thus, these structural properties led to higher activity over Ni-SiO2-Urea than the corresponding catalyst with equivalent pore structure. Relative to the initial methane conversion of 74% over Ni/B-SiO2, Ni-SiO2-Urea catalyst showed both stable CH4 and CO2 conversions and a constant H-2/CO ratio close to 1, without significant decay of the activity during 24 h on stream.					yuan, xq/KTI-7992-2024; wang, xiujun/MDT-3016-2025														0378-3820	1873-7188				JUL	2018	176						153	166		10.1016/j.fuproc.2018.03.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2018.03.032													WOS:000435062600020

Application of the consortia of nitrifying archaea and bacteria for fish transportation may be beneficial for fish trading and aquaculture	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												The growing popularity of the aquarium trade is greatly increasing the demand for many ornamental fish. While shipping technology has made the worldwide transportation of ornamental fish possible, a significant portion of the fish caught for the aquarium trade perish in transport before being sold to hobbyists. One of the major causes of fish death in transport is ammonia building up to toxic levels in the shipping bags. In order to solve this problem, we investigated the effectiveness of using nitrifying consortia in reducing the ammonia build-up in marine fish bags during transport. A pre-activated nitrifying consortium was effective in safely maintaining low ammonia levels during a three-day experiment. We found that both ammonium chloride and urea can activate nitrifying consortia. Activation of nitrifiers by urea is not only novel but also beneficial due to being less harmful to fish in comparison with ammonia. We also discovered that unexpectedly one nitrifying consortium examined mainly contained ammonia-oxidizing archaea. The confirmation of the concept of the use of activated nitrifying consortia and the usefulness of nitrifying archaea for fish transportation may be beneficial for the fish trading and aquaculture.

LaCoO3 Nanostructures Modified Glassy Carbon Electrode for Simultaneous Electrochemical Detection of Dopamine, Ascorbic Acid and Uric Acid	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY												Diverse morphologies of LaCoO3 nanostructures have been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process by changing the surfactants. These nanostructures were used to modify the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the simultaneous electrochemical detection of dopamine (DA) in the presence of excess ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). The electrochemical behavior of modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The results confirm strong electrocatalytic activity for LaCoO3 nanostructure prepared with urea as surfactant is better than other surfactants such as citric acid and N-cetyl-N, N, N-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB). Hence, the LaCoO3 prepared with urea as surfactant has been used as an electroactive probe for the simultaneous electrochemical detection of DA, AA and UA. The final results clearly confirm the selective and sensitive detection of DA, AA and UA in real biological samples. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

However, it is a type of carbohydrate that burns very easily, which limits its applications, especially in areas where good thermal stability and low flammability are requested. In this study, phosphorylated cellulose fibers (P-CF) was prepared via ternary choline chloride/urea/ phosphorous acid reactive deep eutectic solvent (RDES) pretreatment. The influences of different conditions (reaction temperature, time, mass ratio of cellulose to RDES and molar ratio of choline chloride/urea/ phosphorous acid) on the charge density and yield of P-CF were studied. Phosphorylated cellulose nanofibrils (PCNF) with an average width of 5.1 +/- 0.2 nm were obtained after subsequential ultrasonication. The peak heat release rate of P-CNF was reduced by 89.1 % compared with unmodified softwood pulp, and the limiting oxygen index value increased to 44.8 %. Furthermore, the fabricated P-CNF based film demonstrated good selfextinguishing behavior in both horizontal and vertical combustion tests, high transparency (visible-light transmittance above 80 %) and robust mechanical properties. This developed RDES system provided a new and sustainable route to prepare intrinsically flame-retardant nanocellulose, which may have potential applications in many fields such as thermal insulation, and electronics.																			0144-8617	1879-1344				JAN 15	2025	348		B						122931	10.1016/j.carbpol.2024.122931	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2024.122931		OCT 2024						39567149					WOS:001349655200001

Herein, a facile one-pot KNO3-assisted thermal polymerization of thiourea and urea was reported for the modification of g-C3N4 with K dopants and N defects (denoted as M-CN-K-1). As a visible light photocatalyst with isopropanol as an electron donor, the obtained M-CN-K-1 sample exhibited an excellent H2O2 production activity of 2.92 mmol g(-1) g-C3N4 h(-1), which was 15.6, 5.8 and 2.2 times that of pristine g-C3N4 samples derived from urea, thiourea, and a mixture of thiourea and urea, respectively. The outstanding performance of the KNO3-modified g-C3N4 is attributed to the controllable introduction of cyano groups on the opened s-triazine heterocycle and K insertion into the g-C3N4 layers, which are conducive to regulating the morphology, electronic structure, and electron withdrawing and transfer capability. The KNO3-modified g-C3N4 possesses a lamellar structure with a high surface area, smaller energy gap for broadened visible light absorption, more negative conduction band position with stronger reduction ability, suppressed recombination of electron-hole pairs, and enhanced electron transfer, which exert a synergistic effect on the photocatalytic H2O2 production. The H2O2 formation in M-CN-K-1 undergoes the pathway of two-step one-electron indirect O-2 reduction (O-2 -> O-(2)-> H2O2). This study provides a facile and promising strategy for the modification of g-C3N4 to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 production activity.

Herein, we present a novel concept of a catalytic device, which adds a NOx storage functionality to a typical SCR catalyst. This enables capture and storage of NOx in lean exhaust streams already at room temperature, with significant efficiencies under dry conditions, as well as direct reduction of the stored NOx at higher temperatures. The proposed system (AdSCR = adsorption + selective catalytic reduction) is intrinsically different from the well-known existing NOx storage reduction (LNT) + SCR systems. In fact, it is free of PGM materials and does not require lean-rich cycling, being operated just like an SCR catalyst. It has therefore potential advantages both in terms of costs and flexibility of the aftertreatment configuration: in principle, it can be integrated into conventional SCR converters, leading to improved deNO(x) efficiencies without additional modifications of the aftertreatment architecture.

We herein report the controlled grafting of graphite surfaces using electrochemically generated aryl radicals templated by self-assembled molecular networks (SAMNs) of bisalkylurea derivatives. A bisalkylurea derivative having two butoxy units acts as a template for the covalent functionalization of aryl groups in between self-assembled rows of this molecule. In contrast, grafting occurs without a spatial order when an SAMN of bis(tetradecyl)urea was used as a template. This indicates that a degree of dynamics at the alkyl termini is required to favor controlled covalent attachment, a situation that is suppressed by strong intrarow intermolecular interactions resulting from the hydrogen bonding of the urea groups, but favored by terminal short alkoxy groups. The present information is useful for understanding the mechanism of the template-guided aryl radical grafting and the molecular design of new generations of template molecules.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY												OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at determining the relationship between fetal chromosomal disorders (CDs), including trisomy 21 (T21), and on first-and second-trimester maternal blood plasma, to identify the time-course metabolic adaptations to the conditions and the possible new plasma biomarkers. Furthermore, a definition of a joint circulatory (plasma) and excretory (urine) metabolic description of second-trimester CDs was sought. STUDY DESIGN: Plasma was obtained for 119 pregnant women: 74 controls and 45 CD cases, including 22 T21 cases. Plasma and lipid extracts (for T21 only) were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and data were handled by variable selection and multivariate analysis. Correlation analysis was used on a concatenated plasma/urine matrix descriptive of second-trimester CD, based on previously obtained urine data. RESULTS: CD cases were accompanied by enhanced lipid beta-oxidation (increased ketone bodies) and underutilization of glucose, pyruvate, and citrate. Lower circulating high-density lipoprotein levels were noted, along with changes in the proline and methanol in the first trimester, and also the urea, creatinine, acetate, and low-density lipoprotein plus very low-density lipoprotein in the second trimester and the different urea and creatinine levels, suggesting fetal renal dysfunction. In terms of plasma composition, T21 cases were indistinguishable from other CDs in the first trimester, whereas in the second trimester, increased methanol and albumin may be T21 specific. Furthermore, first-trimester lipid extracts of T21 showed decreased levels of 18: 2 fatty acids, whereas in the second trimester, lower levels of 20: 4 and 22: 6 fatty acids were noted, possibly indicative of inflammation mechanisms. In both trimesters, high classification rates for CDs (88-89%) and T21 (85-92%) generally relied on variable selection of nuclear magnetic resonance data. Plasma/urine correlations confirmed most metabolic deviations and unveiled possible new ones regarding low-density lipoprotein plus very low-density lipoprotein, sugar, and gut-microflora metabolisms. CONCLUSION: This work partially confirmed previously reported data on first-trimester T21 and provided additional information on time-course metabolic changes accompanying CD and T21, in particular regarding plasma lipid composition. These results demonstrate the potential of plasma metabolomics in monitoring and characterizing CD cases; however, validation in larger cohorts is desirable.

Regulation of Malate Dehydrogenases and Glutamate Dehydrogenase of Mammalian Brain by Thiamine in vitro and in vivo	BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW												To study the mechanisms of the non-coenzyme action of thiamine and its diphosphate (ThDP) on brain proteins, proteins of acetone extract of bovine brain synaptosomes or the homogenate of rat brain cortex were subjected to affinity chromatography on thiamine-modified Sepharose. In the step-wise eluates by thiamine (at pH 7.4 or 5.6), NaCl, and urea, the occurrence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and isoenzymes of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) along with the influence of thiamine and/or ThDP on the enzymatic activities were characterized using mass spectrometry and kinetic experiments. Maximal activation of the malate dehydrogenase reaction by thiamine is observed after the protein elution with the acidic thiamine solution, which does not elute the MDH1 isoenzyme. Effects of exogenous thiamine or ThDP on the GDH activity may depend on endogenous enzyme regulators. For example, thiamine and/or ThDP activate the brain GDH in eluates from thiamine-Sepharose but inhibit the enzyme in the crude preparations applied to the sorbent. Inhibition of GDH by ThDP is observed using the ADP-activated enzyme. Compared to the affinity chromatography employing the elu-tion by thiamine at pH 7.4, the procedure at pH 5.6 decreases the activation of GDH by thiamine (but not ThDP) in the eluates with NaCl and urea. Simultaneously, the MDH2 content and total GDH activity are higher after the affinity elution at pH 5.6 than at pH 7.4, suggesting the role of the known interaction of GDH with MDH2 in stabilizing the activity of GDH and in the regulation of GDH by thiamine. The biological potential of thiamine-dependent regulation of the brain GDH is confirmed in vivo by demonstration of changes in regulatory properties of GDH after administration of a high dose of thiamine to rats. Bioinformatics analysis of the thiamine-eluted brain proteins shows a specific enrichment of their annotation terms with "phosphoprotein", "acetylation", and "methylation". The relationship between thiamine and the post-translational modifications in brain may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of high doses of thiamine, including the regulation of oxidation of the major excitatory neurotransmitter in brain - glutamate.

Furthermore, carrying out a good quantification and detection of the type of plastic provides valuable information. However, the wastewater is loaded, in addition to a high concentration of organic matter, with a high concentration of cellulose at the treatment plant influent, which seriously hinders detection, quantification and classification of microplastics. The abundance of cellulose materials makes them possible to become false positives for microplastics. Numerous studies on the analysis of microplastics in different matrices show how to remove organic matter from samples, but there are very few studies on the removal of cellulose, which is also found in the samples and hinders their analysis. This study offers a method that combines, for the analysis of microplastics, the already known advanced oxidation treatments for the elimination of organic matter with the novel cellulose removal treatment of the samples with the aim of reducing the amount of cellulose in the influent samples of conventional wastewater treatment plants. To remove the cellulose, 40 mL of a solution of urea 8%, sodium hydroxide 8% and thiourea 6.5% (by weight) were added for every 100 mg of dry sample. The beakers were placed in the freezer at minus 20 C for 40 min and were then placed in agitation until they reached room temperature. After that, the samples were passed through a 53 mu m mesh sieve. They were washed 15 times with 30 mL of ultra-pure water. The method is called UTS because of the acronym of its reagents (Urea/Thiourea/ Sodium Hydroxide). By using the UTS method it is possible to reduce almost completely the cellulose residues from the influent sewage, and sludge samples by 97.6% in a second UTS treatment and 98.2% in a third UTS treatment. In all cases analyzed, the microplastics were identified as high density polyethylene (HDPE) with correlation indices higher than 0.97, which shows that the treatment is harmless for this type of plastic material. The UTS method in combination with the WPO is an efficient and effective method for the analysis of micro plastics in different matrices where cellulose and organic matter may cause possible interferences.

Winter Is Coming: Conserving Body Protein in Female Reindeer, Caribou, and Muskoxen	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Northern ungulates undergo pregnancy in winter when food supplies are low. Consequently, females employ a capital breeding strategy that relies upon maternal body stores of energy and protein for fetal growth. We studied captive female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus;n= 6; 118 kg), caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti;n= 6; 97 kg), and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus;n= 8; 205 kg) in late winter (February to April) to track body protein use in late pregnancy when feeding is often interrupted by snow storms and when wild animals begin movements to spring and summer ranges where they give birth. We used high and low protein rations (14-16 and 8% protein) as complete diets forRangiferand high protein ration as a supplement (500 g/day) to hay (7.3% protein; delta N-15 = 1.1 parts per thousand) forOvibos. Animals were fasted for 2 days to evaluate isotopic responses to an acute deficit of energy and protein on each diet in a sequence from delta N-15 1.6 parts per thousand, to 6.9 parts per thousand to 3.2 parts per thousand over 58 days. Dietary shifts in delta N-15 were reflected in plant fibers in the feces (fecal fiber) but not in blood cells (Rangifer6.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand;Ovibos5.2 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand). Serum proteins were higher in delta N-15 than blood cells whereas serum amino acids were lower in delta N-15 than blood cells and more responsive to changes in dietary delta N-15 indicated by fecal fiber. Fasting did not affect delta N-15 of serum proteins or serum amino acids. Values for delta N-15 in urea were strongly affected by both shifts in diet and by fasting, which indicated that excretory urea N was derived from cellular proteins and isotopically heavy proteins released from organs into the serum. Inter-organ exchanges of transport proteins may minimize oxidation of stored amino acids and conserve body protein stores for fetal growth and milk production inRangiferandOvibos. A capital breeding strategy in these long-lived, iteroparous herbivores relies upon routing of body proteins to simultaneously sustain maternal function and maternal investment through common metabolic pathways that conserve lean body mass for survival.

Different from previous reports that Au/SrTiO3 was generally regarded as only a photocatalyst in the IPA dehydrogenation reaction, in this work, it was found that Au/SrTiO3-urea could also catalyse the reaction at room temperature without light irradiation, with an acetone production rate of 8.2 mu mol h(-1) (IPA conversion of 41.0%) which was more than 10 times higher than that of Pt/TiO2 evaluated under the same conditions. Characterization results revealed that the lattice oxygen in SrTiO3 was involved in the reaction through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, while Au facilitated the cleavage of C-H bonds of the adsorbed reactant with the assistance of a base. Its catalytic activity was further increased to 16.5 mu mol h(-1) (IPA conversion of 82.5%) after the introduction of visible light. It is regarded that the photon induced photocatalytic performance was significantly enhanced with the existence of instantaneously generated oxygen vacancies. Additionally, the conversion of IPA (82.5%) and the rate of acetone production over Au/SrTiO3-urea (16.5 mu mol h(-1)) after visible light irradiation for 1 h were 12.3 times and 2.5 times as high as those over Au/P25 (IPA conversion of 6.7% and acetone production rate of 6.7 mu mol h(-1)), a catalyst which was also reported to be active in IPA dehydrogenation without light irradiation. This study provides a method for designing efficient catalysts for the dehydrogenation of secondary alcohols at room temperature.

Herein, using ferrocene and urea as the precursors of FeOx and graphitic carbon nitride, respectively, a new kind of FeOx modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts has been prepared by a facile one-step calcination procedure. We here, for the first time, report the much-enhanced efficacy of FeOx modified g-C3N4 in the visible light-driven photocatalytic H-2 production. The peak H-2 production rate of 108 mmol h(-1) has been obtained at optimized loading amount of FeOx in the composites, which is about 4.2 times of that on the pure g-C3N4 obtained from urea. This remarkable improvement can be attributed to the enhanced visible light absorbance, improved surface area and charge carrier separation and transfer ability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Maternofetal inflammation induced for 2 wk in late gestation reduced birth weight and impaired neonatal growth and skeletal muscle glucose metabolism in lambs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Intrauterine stress impairs growth and metabolism in the fetus and offspring. We recently found that sustained maternofetal inflammation resulted in intrauterine growth-restricted (MI-IUGR) fetuses with asymmetric body composition, impaired muscle glucose metabolism, and beta-cell dysfunction near term. These fetuses also exhibited heightened inflammatory tone, which we postulated was a fetal programming mechanism for the IUGR phenotype. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether poor growth and metabolism persisted in MI-IUGR lambs after birth. Polypay ewes received serial lipopolysaccharide or saline injections in the first 2 wk of the third trimester of pregnancy to produce MI-IUGR (n = 13) and control (n = 12) lambs, respectively. Lambs were catheterized at 25 d of age. beta-Cell function was assessed at 29 d, hindlimb glucose metabolism at 30 d, and daily blood parameters from day 26 to 31. Glucose metabolism was also assessed in flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle isolated at necropsy on day 31. Asymmetric body composition persisted in MI-IUGR neonates, as these lambs were lighter (P < 0.05) than controls at birth and 31 d, but body and cannon bone lengths did not differ at either age. FDS muscles from MI-IUGR lambs were smaller (P < 0.05) and exhibited reduced (P < 0.05) glucose oxidation and Akt phosphorylation but similar glucose uptake compared with controls when incubated in basal or insulin-spiked media. Similarly, hindlimb glucose oxidation was reduced (P < 0.05) in MI-IUGR lambs under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions, but hindlimb glucose utilization did not differ from controls. Circulating urea nitrogen and cholesterol were reduced (P < 0.05), and triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose-to-insulin ratios were increased (P < 0.05) in MI-IUGR lambs. Glucose and insulin concentrations did not differ between groups during basal or hyperglycemic conditions. Although circulating monocyte and granulocyte concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) in MI-IUGR lambs, plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was reduced (P < 0.05). FDS muscle contained greater (P < 0.05) TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and I kappa B alpha protein content. These findings indicate that maternofetal inflammation in late pregnancy results in fetal programming that impairs growth capacity, muscle glucose oxidation, and lipid homeostasis in offspring. Inflammatory indicators measured in this study appear to reflect heightened cytokine sensitivity in muscle and compensatory systemic responses to it.

Numerous environments are reported for the N atoms, but the P-doping chemistry is less explored and focuses on surface POx groups. A one-step synthesis of P/N-doped carbonaceous materials is presented here, using affordable and industrially available urea and tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride (THPC) as the N and P sources, respectively. In contrast to most of the synthetic pathways toward P-doped carbonaceous materials, the THPC precursor only displays P-C bonds along the carbon backbone. This resulted in unusual phosphorus environments for the materials obtained from direct thermal treatment of THPC-urea, presumably of type C-P-N according to 31P NMR and XPS. Alternatively, the in situ polymerization and calcination of the precursors were run in calcium chloride hydrate, used as a combined reaction medium and porogen agent. Following this salt-templating strategy led to particularly high phosphorus contents (up to 18 wt%), associated with porosities up to 600 m2 g-1. The so-formed P/N-doped porous materials were employed as metal-free catalysts for the mild oxidative dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles to N-heteroarenes at room temperature and in air. Calcination of THPC-urea in metal chloride hydrate salt affords porous P/N-doped carbonaceous materials (up to 18 wt% [P]), used as oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.

EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES												A wearable and, ultimately, an implantable artificial kidney is a long-held aim in the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease, provided that it would combine continuous blood purification, preventing the fluctuations in the internal environment associated with hemodialysis, while maintaining a high efficiency for removal of uremic toxins. Sorbent and enzyme technology, allowing for the regeneration of dialysis fluid, have played a vital role in the development of present prototypes, although the development of a low-weight regeneration module as well as safety and control issues still need to be solved. Whereas the first human trials with a wearable device have been successfully conducted, there are still many hurdles to overcome before wearable dialysis can be routinely implemented in dialysis practice. Important in this respect are the absence of a safe continuous blood access system and the risk balance between anticoagulation and clotting and regulatory aspects.

Current weight-loss plans tend to have disappointing outcomes and are not without risk. During periods of severe energy restriction, obesity predisposes cats to developing fatty liver. Choline has been linked to fat metabolism in other animals but has not been studied in cats. Twelve obese cats were split into two groups and were fed a control diet (n = 6; 4587 mg choline/kg dry matter) or a high choline diet (n = 6; 18,957 mg choline/kg DM) for 5 weeks. Cats were fed to maintain body weight. Choline increased serum cholesterol, triacylglycerides, lipoproteins, and plasma methionine. It also decreased serum blood urea nitrogen and alkaline phosphatase as well as the ratio of plasma acylcarnitine to free carnitine. The results suggest that choline supplementation may increase fat transport out of the liver and help maintain liver health in obese cats. Choline supplementation may prove useful for safe weight loss in obese cats by minimizing the risks of fatty liver. Obesity is a health concern for domestic cats. Obesity and severe energy restriction predispose cats to feline hepatic lipidosis. As choline is linked to lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that dietary choline supplementation would assist in reducing hepatic fat through increased lipoprotein transport and fatty acid oxidation. Twelve obese cats (body condition score [BCS] >= 8/9) were split into two groups. Cats were fed a control (n = 6; 4587 mg choline/kg dry matter [DM]) or a high choline diet (n = 6; 18,957 mg choline/kg DM) for 5 weeks, for adult maintenance. On days 0 and 35, fasted blood was collected, and the body composition was assessed. Serum lipoprotein and biochemistry profiles, plasma amino acids and plasma acylcarnitines were analyzed. The body weight, BCS and body composition were unaffected (p > 0.05). Choline increased the serum cholesterol, triacylglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma methionine (p < 0.05) and decreased the serum blood urea nitrogen and alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.05). Choline also reduced the plasma acylcarnitine to free carnitine ratio (p = 0.006). Choline may assist in eliminating hepatic fat through increased fat mobilization and enhanced methionine recycling.

Substituted and unsubstituted phthalocyanines of Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd, In, and Pt with various raw materials such as phthalonitriles, phthalimides, phthalic anhydrides and phthalic acids are successfully prepared in the DES based on choline chloride and urea in a very short reaction time with appropriate yields. It has been shown that DES as a green and rapidly degraded reaction medium in the environment plays a triple role as a solvent, organocatalyst, and reactant in this process. Moreover, the DES system could be separated and reused in four consecutive reaction runs with no considerable loss in catalytic activity.

Herein, we reported that oxygen-doped CN (OCN) was successfully prepared by molten urea as the only raw precursor, in which thermal copolymerization of urea and in situ formed biuret can effectively incorporate oxygen in the CN network. The introduction of oxygen into CN network greatly improved the visible-light absorption capability, increased the charge carrier mobility and inhibited the electron-hole pairs recombination. In addition, the incorporation of the elemental oxygen with strong electronegativity into CN matrix afforded OCN with more structural base sites, which benefited for the adsorption of CH3SH. As expected, OCN exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic performance toward CH3SH degradation and mineralization under visible-light irradiation. This study demonstrates that a simple precursor pretreatment strategy can achieve the incorporation of beneficial foreign atoms into the CN framework, which provides some guidance for the design and synthesis of high-efficiency CN photocatalyst with peculiar feature.

Herein, we propose an environmentally benign protocol for the selective mono-halogenation of benzo[d]oxazol-2(3H)-ones. Several chloro- and bromo-substituted BOA derivatives were prepared within less than an hour with high to excellent yields (75%-93%) via this novel, green, and energy sufficient method. This rapid and highly reproducible synthetic approach employs inexpensive commercially available urea-hydrogen peroxide complex and hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. Simple operations and precise control over the oxidative halogenation, with water being the major by-product of the reaction outcome, are among the strong point of current facile method from the perspective of green chemistry.

This transformation involves a sequential cyclization and desulfurization/intramolecular rearrangement to produce 2-imino-1,3,4-oxadiazolines. The less-stable N-(het)aroyldiazenes can be conveniently generated in situ by I-2-mediated oxidation of hydrazides, which allows a one-pot synthesis of the products directly from readily accessible hydrazide and isothiocyanate substrates. This operationally simple synthetic process requires no use of malodorous isocyanides and can be conveniently conducted on a gram scale.

The effects of two NH4+-N fertilizers, urea and NH4HCO3, on the transformation of As in a paddy soil with low organic matter content and transfer in rice plants were investigated. Treatments with urea and NH4HCO3 significantly increased arsenite (As(III)) concentration in porewater, bioavailable As in rhizosphere soil, and the relative abundance of the As(V) respiratory reductase gene (arrA) and As(III) methyltransferase gene (arsM). Furthermore, the relative expression of As transporter genes in rice roots, such as OsLsi1, OsLsi2, and OsLsi3, was upregulated, and the translocation efficiency of As(III) from rice roots to brown rice was promoted. Subsequently, As(III) accumulation in brown rice significantly increased. Therefore, attention should be paid to As-contaminated paddy fields with NH4+- N fertilization.

The as synthesized g-C 3 N 4 was well characterized by SEM and EDAX analysis, XRD, ATR-IR, FTIR, Fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and UV -Visible spectroscopy which provide structural, morphological assemblage relating to the structure of g-C 3 N 4 . The g-C 3 N 4 showed that an outstanding photochemical stability, morphology, conductive carbon framework and superior photocatalytic activity. The band gap value of g-C 3 N 4 is 2.34 eV determined using Tauc plot. Due to low band gap (2.33 eV) and unique morphology which provides high separation and migration ability of the photogenerated charges, the g-C 3 N 4 shows enhanced photocatalytic activity for the removal of many organic dyes such as Rhodamine B (RhB), Crystal Violet (CV), Methylene Blue (MB), Methyl Orange (MO), Naphthol Orange (NO) and a phenol derivative, p -Nitrophenol (p -NP). Among them, RhB dye was degraded almost 81 % at 90 min under sunlight irradiation in presence g-C 3 N 4 while other dyes and p -NP was degraded at lower rate. From the experimental data, it was found that MO and p -NP degradation rate was least. The rate constant for degradation of Rh B is 1.1 x 10 -2 min -1 . Therefore, g-C 3 N 4 can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for waste water treatment by the removal of such organic pollutants.

However, the linkage between soil N2O emissions and N-related functional genes under different fertilization strategies from wheat in a wheat-rice double cropping system is rarely examined. Here, we carried out a two-year field study to examine the response of soil N2O emissions driven by N cycling functional genes [archaeal and bacterial amoA (AOA + AOB), nirS, nirK and nosZ] to different fertilization strategies in a wheat cropland of subtropical China. Three fertilizer treatments were established consisting of chemical phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer application (PK), chemical N (urea) and PK fertilizer application (NPK), and chemical NPK fertilizer application with chemical N partially replaced with manure (composted pig manure) (NPKM). Over the two wheat seasons, seasonal total N2O emissions averaged 0.66, 3.60 and 3.11 kg N ha(-1) for PK, NPK and NPKM plots, respectively. Relative to the NPK treatment, the NPKM treatment significantly decreased N2O emissions by 14 % without compromising grain yield, with a lowered combined fertilizer-induced emission factor (EF) of 1.02 %. Compared with the PK treatment, N fertilization consistently and significantly increased the abundance of ammonium-oxidation bacteria (AOB), nirS, nirK and nosZ genes. The nosZ gene, which drives N2O reduction during denitrification, showed a greater extent under NPKM with manure N combination. The AOB had a more sensitive response than ammonium-oxidation archaea (AOA) to chemical N fertilization. Seasonal N2O emissions showed significant positive correlations with AOB gene abundance and the ratio of (nirK+nirS)/nosZ, while had a negative correlation with nosZ gene abundance across N fertilized treatments. The N2O-related microbial composition of functional genes was significantly changed by N fertilizer application and also showed contrasting patterns between treatments of chemical N fertilizer with and without manure N substitution. Together, partially replacing chemical N fertilizer with manure reduced N2O emissions from wheat in a wheat-rice double cropping system, mainly through decreasing AOB associated-nitrifying potential, and particularly stimulating N2O reduction.

To explore novel sources of antifatigue medicine and food, we developed a novel formula composed of wolfberry, figs, white lentils, raspberries, and maca (WFWRM) according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we explored whether the administration of the WFWRM relieves fatigue. Thirty male Kunming mice were divided into three groups, which received either intragastric administration of saline, vitamin C (100 mg/kg), or WFWRM (1.00 g/kg) every day. After 30 days of treatment, all mice exhaustively performed weight-bearing swimming. Another ten mice that did not perform swimming were treated with saline for 30 days and used as sedentary control. The antifatigue effect and biochemical oxidation phenomena were assessed in the exercise-exhausted model and sedentary controls. The histopathological changes in the liver and kidney tissues of mice were observed by performing hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. After 30 days of oral administration, the liver and kidney tissues of mice were healthy and show no pathological changes. Compared to the fatigue model group, WFWRM significantly increased the rota-rod time of the mice. Also, the concentrations of lactic acid (LA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the WFWRM group significantly reduced. On the contrary, the levels of hepatic glycogen (LG), muscle glycogen (MG), and serum glucose (GLU) increased in the WFWRM group. Besides, WFWRM markedly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) but increased the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the concentrations of the sources of energy (LG, MG, and GLU) significantly correlated with those of metabolites (BLA, BUN, CK, and LDH) and antioxidant levels (SOD, GSH-PX, and MDA). Overall, our results suggested that the supplementation of WFWRM could improve exercise capacity and relieve fatigue probably by normalizing energy metabolism and attenuating oxidation.																			1741-427X	1741-4288				MAR 24	2022	2022								3784580	10.1155/2022/3784580	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/3784580								35368749					WOS:000793539000006

However, the achievement of high conversion and high selectivity of GLC from glycerol in heterogeneous catalytic processes remains a challenge due to the absence of high-performance solid catalysts. Herein, highly porous nanocage catalysts composed of well-mixed Co3O4 and ZnO nanocrystals were successfully fabricated via a facile heterometallic metal-organic framework (MOF)-templated synthetic route. Benefiting from a high porosity and the synergistic effect between Co3O4 and ZnO, the as-prepared composite catalysts exhibited a significantly enhanced production efficiency of GLC in the carbonylation reaction of glycerol with urea compared to the single-component counterparts. The yield of GLC over the Co50Zn50-350 catalyst reached 85.2%, with 93.3% conversion and near 91% GLC selectivity, and this catalytic performance was superior to that over most heterogeneous catalysts. More importantly, the proposed templated synthetic strategy of heterometallic MOFs facilitates the regulation of catalyst composition and surface structure and can therefore be potentially extended in the tailoring of other metal oxide composite catalysts.

Three diesel vehicles with different aftertreatment systems (an oxidation catalyst, vehicle-DOC; a particulate matter and NOx reduction system, vehicle-DPNR; and a urea-based selective catalytic reduction system, vehicle-SCR) and a gasoline car with a three-way catalyst were tested. Nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) and nitrophenols in the particles emitted were analyzed by thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The secondary production of nitro-organic compounds on the filters used to collect particles and the adsorption of gaseous nitro-organic compounds by the filters were evaluated. Emissions of 1-nitropyrene, 9-nitroanthracene, and 4-nitrophenol in the diesel exhaust particles were then quantified. The NOx reduction process in vehicle-DPNR appeared to remove nitro-hydrocarbons efficiently but not to remove nitro-oxygenated hydrocarbons efficiently. The nitro-PAH emission factors were lower for vehicle-DOC when it was not fitted with a catalyst than when it was fitted with a catalyst. The 4-nitrophenol emission factors were also lower for vehicle-DOC with a catalyst than vehicle-DOC without a catalyst, suggesting that the oxidation catalyst was a source of both nitro-PAHs and 4-nitrophenol. The time-resolved aerosol mass spectrometry data suggested that nitro-organic compounds are mainly produced when an engine is working under load. The presence of 4-nitrophenol in the particles was not confirmed statistically because of interference from gaseous 4-nitrophenol. Systematic errors in the estimated amounts of gaseous 1-nitropyrene and 9-nitroanthracene adsorbed onto the filters and the estimated amounts of volatile nitro-organic compounds that evaporated during sampling and during post-sampling conditioning could not be excluded. An analytical method in which all gaseous compounds are absorbed before particles are collected, and in which the volatile compounds are derivatized, would improve the precision and the accuracy of the data.

Here, we use a gentle hydrolysis of 1D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to prepare 3D CoCO3, with full and convenient recovery of costly organic ligands. For the first time, 1D nanowires of Co-MOF-74 were transformed into CoCO3 with different 3D morphologies by introducing different modulators of urea or hexamethylenediamine (HMT). The formation mechanism (using urea as a modulator) has been elucidated and has revealed a conversion process from 1D nanowires of Co-MOF-74, subsequently to 1D rod-like stacked 3D Co-MOF-74 nanospheres through aggregate assembly, and then to 3D hydrangea like CoCO3-H. After calcination, it was found that the obtained 3D Co3O4 catalyst derived from 3D CoCO3 exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic performance for VOC degradation compared to 1D Co3O4 directly calcined from Co-MOF-74. In addition, the morphology and the catalytic performance of the catalysts prepared with the recycled ligands were consistent with those of catalysts made from fresh ligands.

Effects of Cu contents on the catalytic performance of the Co1Cux@CN/SiO2 catalysts were investigated for selective hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene to p-chloroaniline. The Co1C0.30@CN/SiO2 with Cu/Co molar ratio of 0.30:1 presented much higher activity and stability than the monometallic Co@CN/SiO2 catalyst. The addition of Cu into Co1Cux@CN/SiO2 catalysts had favorable effects on the formation of highly active Co-N sites and N-doped carbon layer. The role of the N-doped carbon layer was to protect the Co from oxidation by air, and the Co1C0.30@CN/SiO2 could be reused for at least 12 cycles without decrease in catalytic efficiency. Mechanistic and in situ infrared studies revealed that the interaction effect between the Co and Cu atoms made the surface of Co highly electron rich, which decreased adsorption of halogen groups and resulting in the enhanced selectivity during chemoselective hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes for a wide scope of substrates.

Microbial life under ice: Metagenome diversity and in situ activity of Verrucomicrobia in seasonally ice-covered Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Northern lakes are ice-covered for a large part of the year, yet our understanding of microbial diversity and activity during winter lags behind that of the ice-free period. In this study, we investigated under-ice diversity and metabolism of Verrucomicrobia in seasonally ice-covered lakes in temperate and boreal regions of Quebec, Canada using 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Verrucomicrobia, particularly the V1, V3 and V4 subdivisions, were abundant during ice-covered periods. A diversity of Verrucomicrobia genomes were reconstructed from Quebec lake metagenomes. Several genomes were associated with the ice-covered period and were represented in winter metatranscriptomes, supporting the notion that Verrucomicrobia are metabolically active under ice. Verrucomicrobia transcriptome analysis revealed a range of metabolisms potentially occurring under ice, including carbohydrate degradation, glycolate utilization, scavenging of chlorophyll degradation products, and urea use. Genes for aerobic sulfur and hydrogen oxidation were expressed, suggesting chemolithotrophy may be an adaptation to conditions where labile carbon may be limited. The expression of genes for flagella biosynthesis and chemotaxis was detected, suggesting Verrucomicrobia may be actively sensing and responding to winter nutrient pulses, such as phytoplankton blooms. These results increase our understanding on the diversity and metabolic processes occurring under ice in northern lakes ecosystems.(C) 2018 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd					Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020; Tran, Patricia/AAH-3679-2019; Huot, Yannick/B-4497-2008	Walsh, David/0000-0002-9951-5447; Tran, Patricia/0000-0003-3948-3938; Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Huot, Yannick/0000-0003-1793-761X													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUL	2018	20	7					2568	2584		10.1111/1462-2920.14283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14283								29921005					WOS:000443114300020

It has been shown that more free hydroxyl groups on cellulose molecules can be exposed via fibrillation of the fiber walls during a PFI beating process. The changes in fiber characteristics, such as the fibrillation degree, water retention value (WRV), and crystallinity, were analyzed. The results showed that the fiber fibrillation increased from 0.781% to 1.072%, and the WRV increased from 112.8% to 213.6% during the beating process, indicating that a fibrillation effect was present in the bamboo fiber walls that corresponded to an incremental change in the degree of mechanical pretreatment. The saturated solubility value of the treated fibers in an alkali/urea solvent system at low temperature increased from 0.22 wt.% to 2.69 wt.% with an incremental change in the degree of mechanical pretreatment. After high-revolution PFI beating, the cellulose crystallinity index of the samples decreased from 66.4% to 50.0%, but the intrinsic viscosity changed only slightly. The oxidation degree of the cellulose in the treated samples increased from 0.85 mol/AGU to 1.03 mol/AGU, which suggested that the reagent accessibility and chemical reaction performance of the bamboo fibers were both improved.					chen, jiayi/IAP-9353-2023	MAN, LI/0000-0002-2102-0268													1930-2126						2018	13	3					5139	5152																WOS:000440506300028

The energy conversion is achieved through a paper-based microfluidic fuel cell. Urine has recently gained attention as a source of novel biomarkers for early disease detection, making the use of diabetic urine as fuel particularly relevant to the development of autonomous portable medical devices. A key challenge in using diabetic urine as fuel lies in the fact that it contains various molecules and compounds that can block or poison the fuel cell's electrodes. This study introduces a selective catalyst of ZnO and nickel-based particles that oxidize the urea in human urine. Different concentrations of Ni (3%, 6%, and 9%) were evaluated to optimize catalyst activity. The best performance of the diabetic urine-microfluidic fuel cell was achieved with the ZnO-Ni at 3%, yielding a maximum voltage of 0.89 V, a maximum current density of 1.18 mA cm(-2), and a maximum power density of 1.26 mW cm(-2). These results demonstrate the potential for enhancing point-of-care devices through paper-based microfluidic fuel cell stacks.

The ubiquitous occurrence of polyphenols in the human diet demands comprehensive knowledge about physiological and toxicological effects of these compounds on human cells.Methods and resultsThe human hepatocarcinogenic cell line HepG2 is used to elucidate the effects of 13 polyphenols and three respective phenolic degradation products on the human metabolome using HPLC-MS/MS. To investigate structure-activity-relationships, structurally related examples of polyphenols from different compound classes are selected. The analysis of catechins points toward a relation between the degree of hydroxylation and the extent of metabolic effects particularly on the urea cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). A correlation between the modulation of the PPP and the stability of the compounds is demonstrated, which may be caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The incubation of flavones and alkenylbenzenes demonstrates reduced activity of methoxylated compounds and no impact of the B-ring position.ConclusionIn general, polyphenols induce a multitude of metabolic effects, for example, on energy metabolism, PPP, and urea cycle. These metabolic alterations may be related to the widely reported bioactivity of these compounds such as the anticarcinogenic effects. Polyphenols occur widely in the human diet and they are described to have various beneficial effects. The analysis of their effects on the human metabolome using mass spectrometric methods demonstrates structure-activity-relationships specifically related to their degree of hydroxylation and stability. A multitude of cellular effects for example on the energy metabolism, urea cycle, and pentose phosphate pathway are pointed out, which could be related to their described bioactivity.image					Humpf, Hans-Ulrich/AAV-4845-2020	, Andrea Gerdemann/0009-0005-3617-0700; Behrens, Matthias/0000-0001-5425-8144													1613-4125	1613-4133				NOV	2023	67	21								10.1002/mnfr.202300052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.202300052		SEP 2023						37672806					WOS:001059261300001

Artificial intelligence and the analysis of multiplatform metabolomics data for the detection of intrauterine growth restriction	PLOS ONE												Objective To interrogate the pathogenesis of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to multi-platform i.e. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) based metabolomic analysis for the prediction of IUGR. Materials and methods MS and NMR based metabolomic analysis were performed on cord blood serum from 40 IUGR (birth weight < 10th percentile) cases and 40 controls. Three variable selection algorithms namely: Correlation-based feature selection (CFS), Partial least squares regression (PLS) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) were tested for their diagnostic performance. For each selected set of metabolites and the panel consists of metabolites common in three selection algorithms so-called overlapping set (OL), support vector machine (SVM) models were developed for which parameter selection was performed busing 10-fold cross validations. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for IUGR diagnosis. Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) was performed to identify which metabolic pathways were perturbed as a direct result of IUGR in cord blood serum. Results All selected metabolites and their overlapping set achieved statistically significant accuracies in the range of 0.78-0.82 for their optimized SVM models. The model utilizing all metabolites in the dataset had an AUC = 0.91 with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity equal to 0.80. CFS and OL (Creatinine, C2, C4, lysoPC. a. C16.1, lysoPC. a. C20.3, lysoPC. a. C28.1, PC.aa.C24.0) showed the highest performance with sensitivity (0.87) and specificity (0.87), respectively. MSEA revealed significantly altered metabolic pathways in IUGR cases. Dysregulated pathways include: beta oxidation of very long fatty acids, oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, phospholipid biosynthesis, lysine degradation, urea cycle and fatty acid metabolism. Conclusion A systematically selected panel of metabolites was shown to accurately detect IUGR in newborn cord blood serum. Significant disturbance of hepatic function and energy generating pathways were found in IUGR cases.

Copper Supported on Mesoporous Structured Catalysts for NO Reduction	CATALYSTS												Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are one of the pollutants of greatest concern in terms of atmospheric contamination and, consequently, human health. The main objective of this work, is the synthesis of structured carbon catalysts, introducing on their surface metals and nitrogen groups, catalytically active in NO reduction. Structured catalysts represent an attractive alternative to powder catalysts because they have better thermal stability and lower pressure drop. The catalysts were synthesized by coating a melamine foam using precursor solutions of carbon xerogels with and without nitrogen (using melamine and urea as precursors), and impregnated with transition metals (Fe, Ni and Cu). The introduction of nitrogen and metals modified the textural properties of the materials. Samples synthesized with melamine presented the highest amount of nitrogen, while the highest content of copper, found to be the most active transition metal for NO reduction, was found in structured catalysts impregnated with urea. The presence of transition metals in catalysts is essential for the reduction of NO to N-2 and the introduction of nitrogenous precursors makes this evident. The synthesis and application of carbon-supported structured catalysts containing transition metals for NO reduction is demonstrated in this work for the first time, as well as the study of the factors influencing their performance.

Glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in the chickens with dexamethasone-induced oxidative stress	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION												The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of long-term treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) on the antioxidation and nutrition metabolism in broiler chickens. Broilers were placed on a high-nutrient diet for 41days, and half were given orally DEX-supplemented water at 20mg/L every other day from 19 to 41days of age. DEX treatment downregulated superoxide dismutase activity as well as the mRNA expression of CuZn-superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase with a decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio and an increase in malondialdehyde level in the liver of broilers. DEX treatment aggravated oxidative damage in the liver and, therefore, increased the sensitivity of broilers to ascites syndrome with higher mortality and reduced growth performance. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that DEX treatment significantly increased the levels of glucose, intermediates in protein metabolism (valine, proline, serine, threonine and urea) and lipid metabolism-related products (palmitic acid, stearic acid and cholesterol) while decreasing the levels of -hydroxy butyric acid, succinic acid and malic acid, demonstrating that DEX treatment inhibited the Krebs cycle and the oxidation of fatty acids, and promoted the de novo synthesis of fatty acids as well as protein decomposition in the liver of broilers. Additionally, detection of metabolism-related enzymesrevealedthat DEX treatment inhibited glycolysis and promoted glycogen decomposition. In summary, DEX treatment resulted in oxidative stress and glucose and lipidmetabolism disorders in the broilers.

Manipulation of Lipid Metabolism During Normothermic Machine Perfusion: Effect of Defatting Therapies on Donor Liver Functional Recovery	LIVER TRANSPLANTATION												Strategies to increase the use of steatotic donor livers are required to tackle the mortality on the transplant waiting list. We aimed to test the efficacy of pharmacological enhancement of the lipid metabolism of human livers during ex situ normothermic machine perfusion to promote defatting and improve the functional recovery of the organs. Because of steatosis, 10 livers were discarded and were allocated either to a defatting group that had the perfusate supplemented with a combination of drugs to enhance lipid metabolism or to a control group that received perfusion fluid with vehicle only. Steatosis was assessed using tissue homogenate and histological analyses. Markers for lipid oxidation and solubilization, oxidative injury, inflammation, and biliary function were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and in-gel protein detection. Treatment reduced tissue triglycerides by 38% and macrovesicular steatosis by 40% over 6 hours. This effect was driven by increased solubility of the triglycerides (P = 0.04), and mitochondrial oxidation as assessed by increased ketogenesis (P = 0.008) and adenosine triphosphate synthesis (P = 0.01) were associated with increased levels of the enzymes acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, and acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase. Concomitantly, defatted livers exhibited enhanced metabolic functional parameters such as urea production (P = 0.03), lower vascular resistance, lower release of alanine aminotransferase (P = 0.049), and higher bile production (P = 0.008) with a higher bile pH (P = 0.03). The treatment down-regulated the expression of markers for oxidative injury as well as activation of immune cells (CD14; CD11b) and reduced the release of inflammatory cytokines in the perfusate (tumor necrosis factor alpha; interleukin 1 beta). In conclusion, pharmacological enhancement of intracellular lipid metabolism during normothermic machine perfusion decreased the lipid content of human livers within 6 hours. It also improved the intracellular metabolic support to the organs, leading to successful functional recovery and decreased expression of markers of reperfusion injury.

Yet protein, and in particular the essential amino acids (EAAs), need to be present in adequate quantity to support growth. Objective: With the use of a piglet model restricted in dietary amino acids (AAs), we compared the efficacy and safety of a standard formula with a low-AA formula containing an adjusted AA composition. Methods: Female piglets (3-7 d old; Landrace x Yorkshire x Duroc) were fed 1 of 4 isoenergetic AA-based formulas for 14 d (700 kJ . kg body weight(-1).d(-1)). The formulas contained a set control amount (44 g/L) and AA compositions referred to as the experimental standard (ST-100, n = 22), or 20% or 50% lower total AAs (respectively, ST-80, n = 19 and ST-50, n = 13), or 20% lower total AAs with an optimally adjusted EAA composition (O-80, n = 17). A series of clinical and paraclinical endpoints were measured. Results: Growth rates were similar for ST-100, O-80 and ST-80 piglets (all similar to 15 g.kg(-1).d(-1)), whereas ST-50 had a markedly lower weight gain relative to all groups (all P < 0.05). Relative to ST-100, all groups with reduced AA intake showed similar to 16% reduction in plasma albumin and similar to 30% reduction in plasma urea (both P < 0.05). The absolute leucine oxidation rate was similar to 30% lower for O-80 than for ST-100 piglets (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These data show that a 20% reduction in total AA intake for both the control (ST-80) and the adjusted AA (O-80) formula did not have any short-term adverse effects on growth in artificially reared, AA-restricted piglets. The lower absolute leucine oxidation rate observed in O-80 supports the development of an infant formula with an improved AA composition and a moderate reduction in total protein to support adequate growth in healthy infants.					van Harskamp, Dewi/GZN-1383-2022; van Goudoever, Johannes/Y-4520-2018; Burrin, Douglas/AID-0081-2022	van Goudoever, Johannes (Hans)/0000-0003-3960-1703; Thymann, Thomas/0000-0001-7480-6064													0022-3166	1541-6100				JUL	2018	148	7					1109	1117		10.1093/jn/nxy072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy072								29901732					WOS:000438099300008

Is heteroatom doping of activated carbons always a good strategy for enhancing CO2 adsorption?	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												This study shows the substantial impact of textural properties, with greater weight than N-doping, on CO2 adsorption by carbon materials over a pressure range from 1 to 25 bar and a temperature range from 273 to 323 K. It also highlights the importance of providing volumetric CO2 adsorption capacities when presenting newly developed materials. These results were obtained by exploring the influence of O- and N-doping on CO2 uptake on 14 activated carbons (ACs) with distinct specific surface areas, from 1736 to 3200 m2/g, and micropore fractions from 37 to 96 %. Based on 3 commercial ACs, N content was maximized by hydrogen peroxide oxidation and urea treatment, reaching around 11 at.%. O-N-doping mainly impacted the largest pores, reducing material textural properties and thus CO2 adsorption, although it improved CO2/N2 selectivity, especially up to 5 bar and between 273 and 323 K. The contribution of heteroatoms to CO2 uptake was particularly significant at low pressures and high temperatures, with threshold pressures increasing at higher temperatures. Breakthrough simulations were also carried out and the results demonstrate that, despite a lower specific surface area, the Odoped material exhibited longer breakthrough times than its commercial counterpart. This can be attributed to a balance between CO2 adsorption capacity, governed by the textural properties, and tap density, i.e., adsorption capacity per unit volume.

Different types of adhesives are used to connect wood and metal elements, but the compatibility between adhesives used and load-bearing materials must be sufficient, which often is challenging. In adhesive bonding technology, surface treatments are a crucial step in the process. In this study, an atmospheric plasma discharge was employed to enhance the adhesion strength of joints between common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) wood, metals (steel and aluminum alloy), and four different types of adhesives. The optical properties of plasma discharges and its influence on treated substrates' surface morphology depended on the inherent properties of the treated materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the surface oxidation of all the materials after plasma treatment. Consequently, the surface free energy of all materials increased as well. The positive effect of the plasma treatment on the tensile shear strength of single-lap joints shows a high potential of atmospheric plasma treatment technology for enhancement of adhesives strength of joints combining wooden elements, wood and steel, or wood and aluminum alloys. In addition to that, expensive epoxy and polyurethane adhesives could be replaced by more affordable polyvinyl acetate and melamine-urea-formaldehyde adhesives, and still perform at equal levels if the plasma was applied prior to bonding.

J	Sridhar, M; Ferri, D; Van Bokhoven, JA; Kröcher, O				Sridhar, Manasa; Ferri, Davide; van Bokhoven, Jeroen Anton; Krocher, Oliver			Water-assisted oxygen activation during gold-catalyzed formic acid decomposition under SCR-relevant conditions	JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS												Owing to the problems associated with the use of urea as an ammonia precursor compound in the selective catalytic reduction process in automobiles, alternative compounds such as ammonium formate, methanamide, and guanidinium formate have been suggested as more efficient and cleaner candidates. For the application of such formate-based ammonia precursors, a fundamental understanding of catalytic formic acid decomposition in the presence of the diesel exhaust components water and oxygen is required. Oxygen activation is a reaction step common to many catalytic processes. We observed that oxygen activation over titania and base-modified titania-supported gold catalysts is greatly enhanced in the presence of water, resulting in a significant increase in carbon dioxide production from the decomposition of formic acid. Unlike the supports, gold catalyzed the selective production of carbon dioxide. Monodentate and bidentate formates are the kinetically relevant surface species for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide production, respectively. The support acts as a reservoir, storing bidentate formates that do not react in the steady state when formic acid and oxygen (and water) are co-fed. However, during transient experiments, when the feed is switched from formic acid to oxygen (and water), they are reactivated upon reverse spillover to the active site associated with gold, where they decompose to carbon dioxide. In the presence of oxygen and water, carbon monoxide oxidation and the water gas shift reaction do not produce carbon dioxide. Instead, a direct oxidative-dehydrogenation-type pathway proceeds, which strongly differs from stoichiometric formic acid decomposition. A kinetically consistent mechanism is proposed in which the hydroperoxy species facilitate the C-H bond cleavage of formates to release carbon dioxide and water in the rate-determining step.

Fast enhancement on bondability of wheat straw surface for bio-composites manufacture via dielectric barrier discharge plasma	RSC ADVANCES												Waxy layer in outer surface of wheat straw (WS) has greatly limited its application in bio-composites manufacture owing to the poor bondability. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma using glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was applied in outer surface of WS in order to enhance the bondability for biocomposites manufacture. The chemical properties, morphology, and wettability of WS surface after GMA plasma treatment were investigated by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Boehm titration, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical contact angle measurement (OCA). Moreover, the two most commonly used adhesives, namely urea-formaldehyde resin (UF) and phenol formaldehyde resin (PF), were applied to evaluate the surface bondability of WS-based composites. The obtained results showed that numerous polar functional groups (C-OH, C=O, and COOH) were incorporated into WS surface. Surface oxidation and etching effects by GMA plasma treatment result in the appearance of numerous spots and the increase in surface roughness. Moreover, the dramatic increase in surface free energy and attenuation coefficients (K) were observed, indicating the improved wettability. The increased roughness, improved wettability, and enhanced polarity favor the dispersion and permeation process of adhesives and the formation of nail-like adhesives. These facts synergistically improve the bondability of wheat straw surface, demonstrating the increased shearing strength from 0.068 MPa to 1.423 MPa when using PF as adhesive.

The mesoporous silicas used as carriers were prepared via a sol-gel method using a beta-cyclodextrin and urea mixture as a template. The amounts of water added during Si(OEt)(4) hydrolysis and chromium oxide loading were varied. The obtained catalysts were characterised via nitrogen low temperature adsorption-desorption, XRD, SAXS, SEM with EDX, TEM, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and the catalytic tests. The obtained mesoporous silicas have monomodal narrow pore size distributions with the maxima at 7, 9, 10 nm increasing when the amounts of water used during the synthesis increase, and large surface areas of 680, 460, 410 m(2)g(-1), respectively. All the samples do not contain micropores. Chromium oxidation states +6 and + 3 were found according to XPS and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy data. The catalytic tests revealed that there is a correlation between the catalytic activity and synthesis conditions. The catalytic activity in the reaction of oxidative propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 decreases in the series with a pore diameter of 9 > 10 > 7 nm.

PHC displayed protectivity against renal ischemia reperfusion (RIR) injury. Nevertheless, the precise protectivity of PHC on RIR-induced lung injury remains unknown. Methods: We examined the effects of PHC on RIR-induced lung injury and investigated the underlying mechanism. We induced RIR in mice and administrated PHC to RIR mice. Kidney function was monitored by measuring the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine level in serum. We evaluated the lung injury, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung, pro-inflammatory cytokine level, and oxidative markers in serum and lung tissues. We tested the expression level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in lung of RIR mice after PHC treatment. Finally, we evaluated the effects of PHC in RIR Nrf2-/- mice. Results: PHC greatly downregulated the serum levels of BUN, creatinine, IL-6, NO, malondialdehyde (MDA), and matrix metalloproteinase-2. PHC also ameliorated the lung injury, decreased the MPO activity, and suppressed production of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MDA, and O2-, while it promoted production of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in lung. PHC improved the production of Nrf2 and HO-1. Conclusion: The protectivity of PHC was absent in Nrf2(-/-) mice. PHC ameliorated RIR-induced lung injury through Nrf2 pathway.

The photoactive biocomposite was immobilized on the surface of a glass substrate modified with indium doped tin oxide (CdSe/ZnS-Cytc/ITO). The photoactive film was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the photocurrent measurements were obtained by chronoamperometry using a LED light lamp as source of irradiation. After the experimental parameters optimization, the biosensor presented a good response for EP oxidation in a wide linear concentration range between 1 mu mol L-1 and 12 mmol L-1 (with r = 0.999; n = 9). A detection limit of 2 nmol L-1 was obtained. The selectivity of the photosensor was evaluated against species such as uric acid, ascorbic acid, folic acid, barbital, glucose, and urea, and the results showed that the proposed biosensor has a good selectivity for the detection of ER. The CdSe/ZnS-Cytc/ITO photoelectrochemical biosensor was applied in injectable drug samples used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The recovery tests in the samples showed recovery values between 101 and 110% suggesting a good accuracy for the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, the molecular mechanism underlying ammonia toxicity in juvenile Eriocheir sinensis remains poorly understood. This study compared the effects of 24 h exposure to different total ammonia-N concentrations (0, 10.47, and 41.87 mg/L) on antioxidant enzyme activities and tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics in the hepatopancreas of juvenile Eriocheir sinensis. During the experiment, water temperature and pH were maintained at 20.4 +/- 1.4 degrees C and 7.69 +/- 0.46, respectively. Proteomic data demonstrated that Eriocheir sinensis used different metabolic regulatory mechanisms to adapt to varying ammonia conditions. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycogen degradation, and oxidative phosphorylation showed marginally upregulated trends under low ammonia exposure. High ammonia stress caused downregulation of the TCA cycle and provided energy by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid beta oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and glycogen degradation. The detoxification of ammonia into urea and glutamine was suppressed under high ammonia stress. Finally, ammonia exposure induced oxidative stress and caused protein damage. Antioxidant enzyme activity analysis further revealed that exposure to high concentrations of ammonia may induce more severe oxidative stress. This study provides a global perspective on the mechanisms underlying ammonia exposure-induced metabolic changes and stress damage in juvenile Eriocheir sinensis.

Here we report synthesis of nitrogen doped starbon/zinc oxide composite (NS/ZnO), which shows enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). NS/ZnO was synthesized by high temperature annealing of a mixture of alginic acid, zinc chloride and urea, where nitrogen doping in starbon and the formation of Zn-Nx functionalities play an important role in the electrochemical property studies. Remarkably, NS/ZnO composite exhibited onset potential (Eonset) around 1.11 V with substantial half wave potential (E1/2) of 1.02 V vs RHE for ORR. Thus, it showed a high shift to positive voltage compared to commercial Pt/C by 140 mV vs RHE with durability up to 15,000 potential cycles. NS/ZnO composite was also tested for methanol tolerance and was found to be highly selective towards ORR over methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) unlike the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Detailed structural analysis of the composite revealed that ZnO nanostructures and Zn-Nx sites at the interface formed due to interaction of ZnO with N-doped starbon are the key factors responsible for its catalytic performance towards ORR and the stability. Thus, NS/ZnO composite could find potential applications in energy conversion and storage devices.

The geometry of the graft are non -planar as indicated from the values of dihedral angles. The global properties of hardness, global softness and electronegativity were calculated. The calculated small energy gap between highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies shows that charge transfer occurs within the graft compound. The molecular electrostatic potential for the graft was investigated. The obtained total static dipole moment, mean polarizability, anisotropy of polarizability and mean first order hyperpolarizability () were compared with those of urea as a reference material.

J	Weismiller, DG				Weismiller, David Glenn			Expanded Newborn Screening: Information and Resources for the Family Physician	AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN												Each year, 4 to 5 million newborns receive state-mandated screening. Although the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children has identified 34 core conditions that should be incorporated into screening programs, each state manages, funds, and maintains its own program. State programs encompass screening, as well as the diagnosis and coordination of care for newborns with positive findings. Testing for core disorders is fairly standardized, but more extensive screening varies widely by state, and the rigorous evaluation of new screening panels is ongoing. The core panel includes testing for three main categories of disorders: metabolic disorders (e.g., amino acid and urea cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and organic acid disorders); hemoglobinopathies; and a group of assorted conditions, including congenital hearing loss. Family physicians must be familiar with the expanded newborn screening tests to effectively communicate results to parents and formulate interventions. They must also recognize signs of metabolic disorders that may not be detected by screening tests or that may not be a part of standard newborn screening in their state. For infants with positive screening results leading to diagnosis, long-term follow-up involves ongoing parental education, regular medical examinations, management at a metabolic treatment center, and developmental and neuropsychological testing to detect associated disorders in time for early intervention.

Herein, we report a novel strategy to fabricate a self-healing elastomer by introducing interlaced hydrogen bonds with superhigh binding energy. Distinguishing from the quadruple hydrogen bonds reported already, the interlaced hydrogen bond with a lower repulsive secondary interaction and higher binding energy is composed of two molecule units with different lengths and steric hindrance. Connected by the interlaced hydrogen bonds, a supramolecule interlocking network is formed to lock the polymer chains at room temperature, endowing the poly-(urethane-urea) elastomer with an unprecedented ultrahigh strength (117.5 MPa, even higher than some plastics), the superhigh fracture energy (522.46 kJ m(-2)), and an excellent puncture resistance (puncture force reached 181.9 N). Moreover, the elastomers also exhibited excellent self-healing properties (healing efficiency up to 95.8%), high transparency (the average transmittance up to 91.0%), and good durability (including thermal decomposition resistance, thermal oxidation aging resistance, water resistance, and solvent resistance), providing a theoretical basis and technical reference in the development and broadening the application prospects of self-healing elastomers.																			1944-8244	1944-8252				JAN 5	2024	16	2					2802	2813		10.1021/acsami.3c17284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.3c17284								38181409					WOS:001144616000001

This is achieved by capping the Ce3+/Tb3+-doped NaYF4 microrods using para-phenylenediamine (p-PDA). The microrods show strong green emission upon UV excitation due to strong energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb3+ ions. This strong energy transfer is selectively quenched upon addition of H2O2 leading to reduction in the green emission intensity. This selective quenching of the green emission is due to oxidation of p-PDA to Bandrowski's base which has strong absorption band close to 310 nm, which falls in 4f5d emission level of Ce3+ ions. The proposed mechanism is also supported by TD-CAM-DFT calculations performed on p-PDA and its oxidized product. The reduction in the emission intensity is found to be very selective which is verified by the addition of other analytes (glucose, glutamic acid, uric acid, urea, tryptophan, aspartic acid and some metal ions, Na+, K+, SO42+, and Mg2+) which normally co-exist with H2O2 in the body. More than 90% of the initial intensity of the Tb3+ was recovered upon the addition of a NaBH4 solution. The study clearly implies that the resonance energy transfer (RET) using Ln(3+)-doped microrods can serve as a tool to selectively detect H2O2 upto the nanomolar concentration.

The as-obtained Mn-NCA showed highly efficient catalytic activity for the transfer hydrogenation of a broad range of biomass-derived aldehydes, yielding 90-100% conversion and 64-100% selectivity to the corresponding alcohols under mild conditions in an oven without agitation. A combination of controlled experiments and detailed characterization studies indicated that the superior performance of Mn-NCA is attributed to the monolithic three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous architecture and the synergistic effects between homogeneously dispersed MnOx nanoparticles (NPs) and urea-derived basic sites.

Methods and results: IUGR piglets received either a low temperature heated formula (n = 8) or a high temperature heated formula (HHF: n = 8) or suckled naturally for 3 wk postnatally. Then they were fed with normal ad libitum regular diet. N(epsilon)-carboxymethyllysine (CML) was measured in plasma, feces, and formula by HPLC/MS-MS. CML was detected by immunofluorescence in kidney cells. Target renin-angiotensin-apoptotic, pro-inflammatory genes-p62 NF-kappa B, and soluble receptor of AGE (sRAGE) levels were quantified. Compared with that in controls, free CML and plasma urea increased significantly in the HHF-fed group at PND36 (p<0.05). CML was detected in the nuclei of renal tubular cells of formula-fed piglets but not in suckled ones. This presence of CML was associated with the activation of the soluble receptor of AGE. AT1, AT2, caspase 3, caspase 8, NF-kappa B, p62 NF-kappa B, and total protein oxidation in kidney were higher in HHF-fed group as compared to LHF-fed group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Food processes aimed at reducing the concentration of AGEs in infant formula are urgently needed and may be therapeutically relevant for premature and/or IUGR babies.

Conventional wastewater treatment methods consider the most common pollutants; however, they are very expensive and commonly produce toxic by-products. In the scientific community, advanced oxidation processes appear to be the most appealing, and a majority of the published work considers heterogeneous photocatalysis for the degradation of various toxic chemicals. For convenience, the reaction is performed directly in the water environment. In this work, a metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was prepared through a simple thermal method using urea as a precursor. Prepared g-C3N4 was deposited on the surface of the alumina ceramic ring by the dip-coating method using ethylene glycol as binder. The alumina ceramic ring, as substrate, was prepared by the slip casting method. Photocatalytic properties of immobilised graphitic carbon nitride were used for degradation of methylene blue as a model pollutant under simulated solar light irradiation. The photocatalyst was characterised by XRD, FTIR, UV-Vis DRS, TGA, BET and SEM/EDX analyses. The photocatalytic degradation of MB from an aqueous solution was found to increase with increasing irradiation time. It was found that the graphitic carbon nitride immobilised on alumina ceramic is convenient for largescale environmental applications because the whole setup is cheap, nontoxic, easy to operate and offers reusability with a high removal rate of MB after three consecutive cycles.

Breast cancer was associated with imbalance between oxidation and antioxidation. Local oxidative stress in tumors is closely related to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. However, the relationship between systematic oxidative stress and breast cancer remains unclear. This study is aimed at exploring the prognostic value of systematic oxidative stress in patients with operable breast cancer. Methods. A total of 1583 operable female breast cancer patients were randomly assigned into the training set and validation set. The relationship between systematic oxidative stress biomarkers and prognosis were analyzed in the training and validation sets. Results. The systematic oxidative stress score (SOS) was established based on five systematic oxidative stress biomarkers including serum creatinine (CRE), serum albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TBIL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). SOS was an independent prognostic factor for operable breast cancer patients. A nomogram based on SOS and clinical characteristics could accurately predict the prognosis of operable breast cancer patients, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the nomogram was 0.823 in the training set and 0.872 in the validation set, which was much higher than the traditional prognostic indicators. Conclusions. SOS is an independent prognostic indicator for operable breast cancer patients. A prediction model based on SOS could accurately predict the outcome of operable breast cancer patients.

To evaluate the distribution of acylcarnitines and amino acid levels in normal newborns, establish acylcarnitine and amino acid cutoff levels and further preliminary results of inherited metabolic disorders inferentially in the Turkish population. Methods: Newborn screening tests performed by tandem MS from 2016 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The study group included 17,066 newborns born in our hospitals located in various regions of Turkey. Blood samples were obtained from infants older than 24 h of age. Among the 17,066 newborns, the metabolic screening data of 9,994 full-term newborns (>37 weeks) were employed to obtain the percentile distribution of the normal population. The study group (17,066) was screened for 26 types of inborn error of metabolism. Results: Our established cut-offs, were compared with the cut-offs determined by Region for Stork Study and Centers for Disease Control. Among the 26 screened disorders, a total of 12 cases (8 amino acid metabolism disorders, 1 urea cycle defect, 2 organic acidaemias and 1 fatty acid oxidation disorder) were identified. Conclusions: Because of the high rate of consanguineous marriages in Turkey, the development of a nationwide screening panel is necessary for early detection and management of potentially treatable inherited metabolic disorders.

Spin states of metal centers in electrocatalysis	CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS												Understanding the electronic structure of active sites is crucial in efficient catalyst design. The spin state, spin configurations of d-electrons, has been frequently discussed recently. However, its systematic depiction in electrocatalysis is lacking. In this tutorial review, a comprehensive interpretation of the spin state of metal centers in electrocatalysts and its role in electrocatalysis is provided. This review starts with the basics of spin states, including molecular field theory, crystal field theory, and ligand field theory. It further introduces the differences in low spin, intermediate spin, and high spin, and intrinsic factors affecting the spin state. Popular characterization techniques and modeling approaches that can reveal the spin state, such as X-ray absorption microscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, M & ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are introduced as well with examples from the literature. The examples include the most recent progress in tuning the spin state of metal centers for various reactions, e.g., the oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, nitrate reduction reaction, and urea oxidation reaction. Challenges and potential implications for future research related to the spin state are discussed at the end. This tutorial review provides a comprehensive introduction to the spin state of metal centers and its role in electrocatalysis.

They are also critical in regulating many cellular functions including the fatty acid oxidation, the metabolism of glutamate and urea, the anti-oxidant defense, and the apoptosis pathway. Mitochondria are an important source of reactive oxygen species leaked from the electron transport chain while they are susceptible to oxidative damage, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue injury. In fact, impaired mitochondrial function is commonly observed in many types of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, alcoholic dementia, brain ischemia-reperfusion related injury, and others, although many of these neurological disorders have unique etiological factors. Mitochondrial dysfunction under many pathological conditions is likely to be promoted by increased nitroxidative stress, which can stimulate post-translational modifications (PTMs) of mitochondrial proteins and/or oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and lipids. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that various antioxidants, including naturally occurring flavonoids and polyphenols as well as synthetic compounds, can block the formation of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species, and thus ultimately prevent the PTMs of many proteins with improved disease conditions. Therefore, the present review is aimed to describe the recent research developments in the molecular mechanisms for mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue injury in neurodegenerative diseases and discuss translational research opportunities.

One-pot Synthesis of 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydropyrimidin-2(1H)-thione Derivatives and their Biological Activity	JOURNAL OF HETEROCYCLIC CHEMISTRY												2-Thioxo/oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylate derivatives 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d were prepared by the reaction of ethyl acetoacetate and thiourea or urea with aldehydes using NH4Cl as a catalyst. Compounds 2a and 2c reacted with mono and bihalogenated compounds such as ethyl iodide, chloroacetonitrile, epichlorohydrin, acetyl chloride, ethyl bromoacetate, chloroacetic acid, chloroacetylchloride, and/or oxalyl chloride to afford compounds 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 6a, 6b, 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively. Compounds 2a, 2c, and 7 were allowed to react with p-fluorobenzaldehyde to yield the corresponding products 11a, 11b, and 12, respectively. Oxidation of 2a and 2c gave 2b, 13a, 13b, 14, 15, 16 dependent on the oxidizing agent used. Vilsmeiere-Haack formylation of 2a and 2b with POCl3/DMF afforded 17a and 17b. Chlorination of 2b and 2d gave the chlorinated derivative 18a and 18b, which reacted with thiourea to give thioureidopyrimidine 19a and 19b. Reactions of 2a with hydrazine monohydrate, semicarbazide hydrochloride, and sodium hydroxide gave compounds 20, 21, 22, respectively. The cytotoxicity and in vitro anticancer evaluation of some prepared compounds have been assessed against two different human tumor cell lines including breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 and human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2.

In this paper, a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) tested the emissions of eight different types of construction machinery under actual operating conditions and was used for idling, walking, and working under the different emission reduction techniques. The results showed that the pollutant emission of construction machinery is affected by the pollutant contribution of working conditions. According to different emission reduction techniques, the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) can reduce carbon monoxide (CO) by 41.6-94.8% and hydrocarbon (HC) by 92.7-95.1%, catalytic diesel particulate filter (CDPF) can reduce particulate matter (PM) by 87.1-99.5%, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) using urea as a reducing agent can reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 60.3% to 80.5%. Copper-based SCR is better than vanadium-based SCR in NOx reduction. In addition, the study found that when the enhanced 3DOC + CDPF emission reduction technique is used on forklifts, DOC has a "low-temperature saturation effect", which will reduce the emission reduction effect of CO and THC. The use of Burner + DOC + CDPF emission reduction techniques and fuel injection heating process will increase CO's emission factors by 3.2-3.5 and 4.4-6.7 times compared with the actual operating conditions.					, 李俊杰/AAZ-3363-2020; wang, shuxiao/H-5990-2011; Wang, Junjie/HMV-7993-2023	Meng, Zhongwei/0000-0002-6403-1530; wang, shuxiao/0000-0001-9727-1963; Wang, Junjie/0000-0001-6910-1254														1660-4601				AUG	2022	19	15							9546	10.3390/ijerph19159546	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159546								35954897					WOS:000839001700001

Herein, RGO-g-C3N4-Co3O4 hybrid nanostructure could boost the electrocatalytic performance of nanoparticles by avoiding the clustering of nanoparticles. These spinel-based composites are stable and affordable materials. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed enhanced electron transfer at the modified electrode, as evidenced by the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) for the RGO-g-C3N4-Co3O4/Pt electrode. An increased electroactive surface area compared to bare and other modified Pt electrodes was obtained. Several experimental parameters were optimized to maximize sensitivity, including the choice of supporting electrolyte and pH. Cyclic voltammetry conducted at varying scan rates confirmed that the oxidation of dopamine followed a diffusion-controlled process. The modified electrode exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity, with a detection limit as low as 8.10 x 10(-7) M, demonstrating a wide linear range between 2.00 x 10(-6) M to 4 x 10(-4) M. Selectivity tests indicated that the sensor could reliably detect dopamine in the presence of common interfering substances such as NaCl, KCl, glucose and urea, ascorbic acid, uric acid and L-dopa. This enhanced sensitivity and selectivity were validated in both synthetic blood and urine samples, providing the electrode's potential for real-world applications in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

Efficacy of Quercetin and Quercetin Loaded Chitosan Nanoparticles Against Cisplatin-Induced Renal and Testicular Toxicity via Attenuation of Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Apoptosis	PHARMACEUTICALS												Background/Objectives: Flavonoids, including quercetin, have attracted much attention due to their potential health-promoting effects. Methods: The current experiment aims to see whether quercetin (QUE) in nanoparticle form could mitigate testicular and renal toxicity caused by cisplatin (CIS) more effectively than normally formulated QUE. Rats were randomly treated with CIS alone or in combination with QUE or QUE.NPs (Quercetin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles) for 4 weeks. QUE and QUE.NPs were given orally (10 mg/kg, three times a week), while CIS was given intraperitoneally (2 mg/kg, twice a week). Results: Compared to QUE- and CIS + QUE.NP-treated rats, CIS exposure induced anxiety and emotional stress as well as promoted oxidative stress in both testicular and renal tissues. Moreover, CIS reduced serum testosterone levels and diminished testicular IL-10, as well as CIS-induced renal failure, as indicated by hypokalemia, and increased levels of creatinine, urea, sodium, IL-18, and KIM-1. Further, severe histological changes were observed in the testis and kidney of CIS-intoxicated rats. Regarding immunohistochemical staining, CIS significantly upregulated Bax, downregulated Bcl-2, and moderately enhanced PCNA expression. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both QUE and QUE.NPs modulated emotional disturbance and improved testicular and renal functions via modulation of oxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis. However, QUE.NPs performed better than QUE-treated rats.

Hull cell tests were used to study the influence of the current density on composition of the coatings and their morphology. Surface morphology, chemical composition and oxidation state of the obtained coatings were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Furthermore, electrochemical characterization and corrosion tests were performed in order to evaluate the corrosion properties of the electrodeposited Zn-Ce coatings. The cathodic deposition of Zn-Ce was achieved for the first time using the deep eutectic solvent choline chloride-urea as an electrolyte. Cerium was incorporated in the coating as oxide or mixed oxide within the Zn metal matrix. The composition and morphology of the electrodeposited coating were dependent on the applied current density. Electrochemical corrosion tests showed similar corrosion rates for all the coatings. Nevertheless on scratched tests with a ratio area of 15:1, for Zn-Ce coatings cerium oxide somehow migrates from the coating to the high pH cathodic areas developed on the surface of the bare steel substrate. Further study is still necessary to improve the corrosion protection of the Zn-Ce coating for carbon steel.

However, the photoluminescence mechanism for CDs remains unclear, which limits their further practical application. Here, CDs were synthesized via a solvothermal route from citric acid and urea. Through the oxidation and reduction treatment of pristine CDs, the origin of the photoluminescence and the involved mechanism were revealed. We found that the blue/green/red emissions originated from three diverse emitting states, i.e. the intrinsic state, and C=O- and C=N-related surface states, respectively. Based on the as-prepared CDs, a pH sensor depending on the radiometric luminescence detection was developed. Furthermore, we constructed CD/PVP (PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone) composite films, which exhibited white light emission with photoluminescence QYs of 15.3%. The white light emission with different correlated color temperatures (CCTs), from 4807 K to 3319 K, was obtained by simply changing the amount of PVP solution. Benefiting from the white light-emitting solid-state films, single-component white light-emitting diodes were fabricated with an average color rendering index value (Ra) of 80.0, luminous efficiency of 10.2 lm W-1, and good working stability, thus indicating a promising potential for practical lighting applications.

Development of a kinetic spectrophotometric method for insecticide diflubenzuron determination in water and baby food samples	HEMIJSKA INDUSTRIJA												A kinetic spectrophotometric method for determining residues of insecticide diflubenzuron 1(4-chlorphenyl)-3-(2,6-diflubenzoyl)urea (DFB) has been developed and validated. Kinetic method was based on the inhibitory effect of DFB on the oxidation reaction of sulfa nilic acid (SA) by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of Co2+ ions in a phosphate buffer, which was monitored at 370 nm. DFB can be measured in the concentration interval 0.102 - 3.40 mu g mL(-1) and 3.40 - 23.80 mu g mL(-1). The detection and quantification limits of the method were calculated according to the 3 sigma criteria and found to be 0.077 mu g mL(-1) and 0.254 mu g Ml(-1), respectively. The relative standard deviations for five replicate determinations of 0.102, 1.70 and 3.40 mu g mL(-1) DFB were 2.08, 1.22 and 1.21 %, respectively, for the first concentration interval, and the recovery percentage values were from 94.12 to 97.35 %. HPLC method was used as a parallel method to verify results of the kinetic method. The kinetic method was successfully applied to determine diflubenzuron concentrations in spiked water and baby food samples after solid phase extraction of the samples. The F and t values at 95% confidence level are lower than the theoretical ones, confirming agreement of the developed and the HPLC method.

In this study, nitrogen-doped porous biochar derived from a waste litchi branch was prepared as a peroxydisulfate (PDS) activator for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation, in which the regulation behavior of biochar adsorption was evaluated on the basis of phase distribution and PDS activation mechanism. N-doped biochar obtained at 800 degrees C with urea and sodium bicarbonate added presented a high specific surface area (821 m(2)/g), abundant nanopores, and a graphitic structure, and showed the best adsorption capacity and catalytic activity toward BPA. At a dosage of 0.15 g/L NBC-800, 95% BPA can be completely degraded within 60 min with an apparent rate constant (k(obs)) of 0.0483 min(-1). The identified active sites and reactive oxygen species as well as electrochemical tests suggested that both free radicals O-2 center dot(-) and center dot OH and nonradical pathways including O-1(2) originated from C = O and surface electron-transfer mechanisms were involved in BPA decomposition. The experiments and activation mechanisms all confirmed that BPA adsorption on the NBC-800 surface was an extremely crucial step for BPA oxidative degradation.

In this study, an efficient flame retardant ammonium of aminopropyl silanol methylene phosphate (AASMP) was synthesized using 3-aminopropylethoxysilane, phosphorous acid, urea and formaldehyde under mild and solvent-free conditions to solve cotton inflammable problems. AASMP was grafted onto the surface of cotton fabric, and new P-O-C covalent bonds, were generated using pad-curing treatment to obtain flame-retardant cotton fabrics. The treated cotton was characterized by scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, and confirmed that AASMP was grafted well with slight damage to the cotton structure. Cotton treated with 30% AASMP achieved a 45.0% high limiting oxygen index (LOI). After 50 laundering cycles, a 31.0% LOI was retained, indicating that AASMP imparted remarkable flame retardancy and excellent washing durability to cotton. The results of cone calorimetry showed that the peak-heat release rate of the treated cotton was 6.57kW/m(2), which was significantly lower than that of the control cotton (186.55kW/m(2)). Thermogravimetric results demonstrated that treated cotton with 34.2wt% residue at 800 degrees C exhibited significant thermal stability and thermal oxidation stability. The mechanical property of the treated cotton slightly decreased but retained more than 70%. Treated cotton can be used in clothing and interior items.

However, current recycling approaches generally based on hydro-/pyrometallurgy fail to cater to Co-free cathodes (e.g., LiFePO4, or LFP) owing to high consumption and secondary contamination. Here, a sustainable process is proposed for the revival of defective LFP cathodes through the synergy of defect-targeted healing and surface modification. Li deficiency and Fe oxidation of cathodes are precisely repaired by solution-based relithiation; meanwhile, 3D-interconnected porous carbon networks (3dC) are in-situ constructed with the intervention of salt template during annealing, which enhances the rate performance and electronic/ionic conductivity, by providing more convenient migration channels for Li ions and controlling carbon hybridization. Nitrogen is also doped via induction of urea to fabricate advanced nanohybrid rLFP@3dC-N. New cells using rLFP@3dC-N as cathode exhibit a reversible capacity of up to 169.74 and 141.79 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 1C, respectively, with an excellent retention rate of over 95.7% at 1C after 200 cycles. Impressively, a high capacity of 107.18 mAh g(-1) is retained at 5C. This novel concepts for Li replenishment and the construction of ion-transfer channels as well as conductive networks facilitate the regeneration of spent LFP and the optimization of its high-rate performance.					jia, pingshan/GSD-8207-2022; wang, wenlong/L-2239-2013														0956-053X	1879-2456				MAR 1	2023	158						125	135		10.1016/j.wasman.2023.01.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2023.01.012		JAN 2023						36682334					WOS:000923873500001

The sheet-like graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) wa synthesized by pyrolysis of urea, which was further doped with metallic copper to obtain Cu@g-C3N4. The synthesized Cu@g-C3N4 was characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The Cu@g-C3N4 suspension was drop-cast onto PGE to constitute PGE/Cu@g-C3N4 working electrode. The developed electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and further employed for detection and quantification of CTL. The electrochemical investigation of the developed sensor showed enhanced activity toward electro-oxidation of CTL. Differential pulse voltammetry studies revealed superior sensor characteristics such as sensitivity (0.1487 mu A mu M-1 cm(-1)), selectivity, broad linear range (100-900 mu M), and limit of detection (LOD) (15.12 mu M). The study benchmarks the use of Cu@g-C3N4 as an excellent transducer material in electrochemical sensing of CTL in tea and standard samples, thus proving its potential application in the analysis of CTL in food and environmental samples.

Metagenomic analysis of nitrogen-cycling genes in upper Mississippi river sediment with mussel assemblages	MICROBIOLOGYOPEN												We investigated the impact of native freshwater mussel assemblages (order Unionoida) on the abundance and composition of nitrogen-cycling genes in sediment of an upper Mississippi river habitat. We hypothesized that the genomic potential for ammonia and nitrite oxidation would be greater in the sediment with mussel assemblages, presumably due to mussel biodeposition products, namely ammonia and organic carbon. Regardless of the presence of mussels, upper Mississippi river sediment microbial communities had the largest genomic potential for nitrogen fixation followed by urea catabolism, nitrate metabolism, and nitrate assimilation, as evidenced by analysis of nitrogen cycling pathway abundances. However, genes encoding nitrate and nitrite redox reactions, narGHI and nxrAB, were the most abundant functional genes of the nitrogen cycling gene families. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), we found nitrification genes were the most important biomarkers for nitrogen cycling genomic potential when mussels were present, and this presented an opposing effect on the abundance of genes encoding nitric oxide reduction. The genes involved in nitrification that increased the most were amoA associated with comammox Nitrospira and nxr homologs associated with Nitrospira. On the other hand, the most distinctive biomarkers of microbial communities without mussels were norB and nrfA, as part of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium pathways, respectively. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the impact of native mollusks on microbial nitrogen cycling in an aquatic agroecosystem.

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are green solvents to efficiently separate metals with less emission. In this study, a novel route for direct electroseparation of Zn from ZnS in eco-friendly choline chloride-urea DES with the addition of malonic acid (MA) is studied for the first time. The role of MA and the reduction behavior of Zn(II) are systematically analyzed by cyclic voltammetry. The reduction of Zn(II) is quasi-reversible and follows one-step two-electron transfer process. Pure Zn with nanostructure is obtained with the current efficiency of 86.5 % and energy consumption of 2621.8 kWh.t(-1) at the optimized parameters of 10 mA.cm(-2), 353 K and 100 mM.L-1 ZnS. Mechanisms analyses indicate that in the presence of 60 mM.L-1 MA, besides [ZnCl3-] and [ZnCl5-](3), some ZnS are dissolved to form stable [Zn(MA)(2)-Cl-2(-)](4-), [Zn(MA)Cl-2-(-)](3-) and other MA based ligands, which causes a higher Zn ion solubility of 0.13 mol.L-1 and may promote the subsequent electroseparation of ZnS. Results from this study are expected to propose a simplified route to directly separate Zn from ZnS without oxidation pretreatment to achieve hazardous waste minimization.

Net fluxes of glucose, lactate, urea, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and amino acids were recorded in control and overfed female mini-pigs supplemented or not with fibre-enriched bread. SCFA in fecal water and gene expressions, but not protein levels or metabolic fluxes, were measured in muscle, adipose tissue, and intestine. Fibre supplementation increased the potential for fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial activity in muscle (acox, ucp2, sdha and cpt1-m, p < 0.05) as well as main regulatory transcription factors of metabolic activity such as ppar alpha, pgc-1 alpha and nrf2. All these features were associated with a reduced muscle fibre cross sectional area, resembling to controls (i.e., lean phenotype). SCFA may be direct inducers of these cross-talk alterations, as their feces content (+52%, p = 0.05) was increased in fibre-supplemented mini-pigs. The SCFA effects could be mediated at the gut level by an increased production of incretins (increased gcg mRNA, p < 0.05) and an up-regulation of SCFA receptors (increased gpr41 mRNA, p < 0.01). Hence, consumption of supplemented bread with fermentable fibres can be an appropriate strategy to activate muscle energy catabolism and limit the establishment of an obese phenotype.

Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde may be formed through the ethanol and methanol oxidation. respectively Acrolein may arise as a thermal degradation product of glycerol, amino acids. carbohydrates and triglycerides or by metabolic activity of microorganisms. In addition, acrolein and furfural are formed during wood combustion: therefore, these aldehydes may be present in raw materials due to the environmental contamination. Furfural is also a product of the Maillard reaction formed from sugars and amino acids, while ethyl carbamate occurs through the reaction between urea and ethanol. These compounds may react with SO2 and phenolic compounds to form non-volatile adducts, which positively modulates color stability astringency and aroma in wine. However, when ingested through wine, electrophilic carbonyl compounds may firm adducts with nucleophilic targets, such as DNA. resulting in genotoxicity along the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, carbonyl compounds induce the increase of reactive oxygen species and can trigger apoptosis, in addition to hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma as a consequence of chronic hepatotoxicity. Neurodegenerative diseases may be related to the exposure to carbonyl compounds. Therefore, strategies to reduce the levels of these compounds should be studied in order to get the most out of the beneficial functional properties of wine consumption.

Copper-alumina nanocomposite coating on copper substrate through solution combustion	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL												The main objective of the present research is to investigate the production of Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposite coating on a copper substrate using solution combustion synthesis. Solution combustion synthesis is mainly used to produce nanocomposite powders; however, in this study it is applied to produce nanocomposite coat. For this purpose, both copper and aluminum nitrates (Cu (NO3)(2)center dot 3H(2)O and Al (NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O) are used as oxidizers. Also, urea and graphite are respectively used as fuel to synthesize the Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposite and as inhibitor to prevent the oxidation of the synthesized copper. The microstructure and morphology of the nanocomposite coating, which includes 25 wt% alumina as the reinforcing phase, was studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy at different fuel/oxidizer ratios ranging from 0.9 to 2. The temperature variation during the process was measured as a function of time using a precise thermocouple. Finally, micro-hardness and wear tests were conducted on the nanocomposite coating. The results verified the formation of Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposite coating. Time-temperature curve illustrated that the highest temperature was achieved at the fuel/oxidizer ratio of 1.25. The results of the microhardness and wear resistance test showed that these properties depend heavily on the fuel/oxidizer ratio, with the best condition attained at the ratio of 1.25.

This study used a growing pig model to mimic common-sense eating habits. Four feeding patterns were set up, including ad libitum feeding (ALF) for daily irregulated eating habits, time-restricted feeding (TRF) for three meals a day, early time-restricted feeding (eTRF) for skipping dinner and mid-day time-restricted feeding (mTRF) for skipping breakfast. The results showed that the three time-restricted feeding patterns (TRF, eTRF and mTRF) resulted in a reduction of hepatic fat accumulation and a decrease in hepatic function markers compared to the ALF pattern. However, this was independent of food consumption. Transcriptome analysis of the liver showed that the three time-restricted feeding patterns downregulated the expression of genes related to gluconeogenesis, beta-oxidation, lipid accumulation, and urea cycle, and upregulated the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and glycolysis compared to the ALF pattern. Microbiome and metabolome analyses showed that Lactobacillus enriched in the colon of pigs in three time-restricted groups were negatively correlated with serum triglyceride. Meanwhile, three time-restricted feeding patterns elevated the levels of the microbial metabolite indole-3-lactic acid, which was further confirmed to reduce excessive hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro. Overall, time-restricted feeding potentially improved metabolic health by modulating gut microbiota and metabolites.

To analyze the impact of calcium alternative on microbial community, calcium alternative was introduced in the MICP process of treating coal dust with microbial dust suppressants. Results showed that calcium alternative affected the MICP process of the enriched microorganisms. During the growth period of 48 h, calcium alternative improved the species richness of the genera. Urease activity of the microbial community after calcium nitrate treatment could reach 7.48 mM min(-1), and the bioavailability during mineralization cycle was 94.57%. The biochemical processes of MICP were more diversified, such as urea hydrolysis, organic oxidation and nitrate dissimilation reduction. In addition, the mechanisms of calcium tolerance were also diverse, such as osmotic adjustment, metabolism, signal transduction, and interspecific cooperation. Quorum sensing strategy was the dominant of defense mechanism. Next, dust suppression experiments showed that calcium nitrate microbial dust suppressant had strong dust suppression ability, with a rain erosion mass loss of 29.25%, and a wind erosion rate 0.92 g m(-2)center dot min(-1) under the wind speed of 10 m/s.

FeTiO3 nanohexagons based electrochemical sensor for the detection of dopamine in presence of uric acid	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A simple hydrothermal synthesis of FeTiO3 nanohexagons and its application in the detection of dopamine (DA) in presence of uric acid (UA) was reported. The FeTiO3 nanohexagons were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal route using urea as the stabilizing agent. The material was characterized with transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The FeTiO3 modified glassy carbon electrode was further employed for detection of DA and UA. The sensor showed an excellent performance in terms of detection limit, linear range and sensitivity. For DA, the detection limit was deduced as 1.3 nM with a sensitivity of 1.56 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2) and linearity was observed in the range from 1 mu M to 90 mu M and 110 mu M-350 mu M. And for UA, the detection limit and linear range was estimated as 30 nM and 1 mu M-150 mu M and 200 mu M-500 mu M. The catalytic rate constant for dopamine oxidation on FeTiO3 was estimated as 2.946 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1). Further, the simultaneous detection of DA and UA was demonstrated on FeTiO3/GCE. The practical applicability of the sensor was tested in serum and urine biological samples.						, T. K.

Degradability of poly(ether-urethanes) and poly(ether-urethane)/acrylic hybrids by bacterial consortia of soil	INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION												An enrichment culture strategy was used to obtain natural consortia from soil in order to study the biodegradability of poly(ether-urethanes) (PUE). PUE were synthesized with different aliphatic diisocyanate group, termed PUIPDI and PUHMDI. In addition, PUE/acrylic hybrids, termed PUH90:DEA10 and PUH70:DEA30 consisted of PUHMDI and increasing ratio of 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DEA) were tested. PUIPDI was biodeteriorated through urea-bond hydrolysis by a consortium dominated by Acinetobacter. A higher biodeterioration rate was demonstrated for PUHMDI, which exhibited large surface holes and a greater weight loss. The hydrolysis of ester-urethane bonds and the oxidation of soft-segment ether bonds were the key reactions identified, possibly by Acinetobacter, Mycobacterium, Sphingopyxis and Pseudomonas, which were present in this consortium. Diverse metabolic functions were also predicted. The addition of DEA favored the biodegradability of PUH:DEA hybrids demonstrated by the increased weight loss, swelling degree and the hydrolysis of DEA-ester bond. Urethane and ether bonds degradation were also detected. PUH:DEA hybrids selected even bacterial consortia, most likely by allowing better access to the nutrients. Pseudomonadaceae and Bradyrhizobiaceae families got relevance in these consortia and their outstanding features were cell mobility and quorum sensing. This work has provided a deeper insight into PUE biodegradation by proposing the chemical mechanisms, bacterial taxa and functions that could be implicated.					pardini, francisco/HGB-1862-2022														0964-8305	1879-0208				MAY	2021	160								105205	10.1016/j.ibiod.2021.105205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2021.105205		MAR 2021											WOS:000647675400005

NCMs with different doping amounts were prepared from corn straw and urea. Results showed that nitrogen doping can notably enhance the photodegradation of SMT rather than raw char. NCMs are of photochemical activity under visible light, which was confirmed by monochromatic light experiments. Quenching experiments, ESR, pH effect, and the influence of O-2 were carried out to explore the involved oxidation mechanism in this system. Results showed that O-1(2) was the main reactive oxygen species. O-1(2) was produced from O-2 by both energy transfer and electron transfer. DFT calculations showed that pyridinic N doping can decrease the energy of intersystem crossing and thus benefit the generation of O-1(2) by triplet-triplet energy transfer. Results underscore the explicit importance of nitrogen element in photochemical reactivity of chars under simulated light irradiation even when the nitrogen content is low. It is a meaningful reminder for us to pay more attention to the assessment of the fate and transport of contaminants in the soil where it is rich in NCMs as well as the potential use of NCMs for pollutants remediation, since visible light is very abundant near the earth's surface.

The main objective of this work was to know experimentally the role of total oxidants (produced by Reactive Oxygen species (ROS), clinical biochemical indices, their oxidized products and total antioxidant status (TAS) among such patients to find the association of homocysteine, total oxidation status (TOS) and oxidative DNA damage with other clinical parameters in sixty positive CVD patients compared with those of 60 normal subjects. As compared to healthy individuals, CVD patients had significantly higher concentrations of homocysteine (p<0.0001), total oxidants stress (TOS) (p<0.0001), serum total lipids (p<0.04), malondialdehyde (MDA) (p<0.001), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (p<0.0001), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p<0.01), than those of healthy individuals. Plasma Hcy content, TOS and amount of DNA were positively and significantly associated with cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, urea, and albumin (p values<0.01). TOS, Hcy and oxidative DNA damage were negatively correlated with HDL-c, TAS and proteins. It is suggested that these parameters have pivotal role in diagnostic process of determining severity in CAD patients. Oxidized products of macromolecules in blood of CVD patients impart major functions in causing CVD disease.

MiR-377 has been reported to regulate inflammation in cardiac and cerebral ischemia. However, it remains unclear whether it has a similar function in renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Using I/R model mice, miR-377 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in the renal tissues. Renal function was assessed by detection of the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr). Oxidative stress was evaluated by ELISA analysis of oxidation-related enzymes and molecules. Inflammatory factor concentration and other protein levels were analyzed by the ELISA assay and Western blot, respectively. Our study found that renal I/R stimulated miR-377 expression, while the inhibition of miR-377 attenuated renal I/R injury, and blocked renal I/R-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. Meantime, NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling were activated by renal I/R, which could also be reversed by miR-377 inhibitor. Furthermore, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) depletion by siRNA completely abrogated the impact of miR-377 on renal I/R-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and renal dysfunction. In conclusion, renal I/R induced miR-377 expression, which upregulated VEGF expression to attenuate renal I/R-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, and finally ameliorated renal dysfunction.					yang, qiang/GYJ-0971-2022	Liu, Zhaohui/0000-0002-7467-9795													0161-5890	1872-9142				FEB	2019	106						153	158		10.1016/j.molimm.2018.12.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2018.12.028								30612004					WOS:000457507200018

Herein, a binder-free electrode of MoS2/CNF (carbon nanofiber) is prepared by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. The growth of MoS2 nanoplates contained within or protruding out from the CNF can be controlled by adding urea or ammonium bicarbonate to the electrospinning precursors, due to the cross-linking effects of urea and the increased porosity caused by pyrolysis of ammonium bicarbonate allowing growth through pores in the CNF. By virtue of the abundant exposed edges in this microstructure and strong bonding between the catalyst and the conductive carbon network, the composite material exhibits ultrahigh electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity in acidic solutions, with current densities of 500 and 1000 mA/cm(2) at overpotentials of 380 and 450 mV, respectively, exceeding the performance of many reported MoS2-based catalysts and even commercial Pt/C catalysts. Thus, MoS2/CNF membranes show potential as efficient and flexible binder-free electrodes for electrocatalytic hydrogen production.

Photocatalysts with porous structures not only enhance the adsorption of pollutants by the catalyst, but also accelerate the electron transfer and enhance the photocatalytic performance due to the exposure of more active sites. In addition, the S-Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst not only reduces the rate of electron-hole pair compounding, but also maintains the redox properties of the photocatalyst and improves photocatalytic performance. In this paper, the mesoporous material TiO2/g-C3N4 S-Scheme heterojunction photocatalysts were prepared in one step by the sol-gel method using urea as a precursor. The particles of the prepared nanomaterials are between 20 and 50 nm in size and uniformly dispersed. The photodegradation efficiency of the photocatalyst for formaldehyde under visible light can reach over 85%.

Here, Ti-doped alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays prepared via the hydrothermal method with the addition of TiCl3 as the Ti source and urea as the morphological regulator were used as photoanodes in photoelectrochemical cells. In the process of a hydrothermal reaction, Ti elemental was incorporated into alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes using TiCl3 as precursor and urea was used as the morphological regulator to assist alpha-Fe2O3 to form nanorod arrays. The photoelectrochemical performance of the as-prepared Ti-doped alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod array (TF1) photoanodes exhibited a remarkable photocurrent of 0.22 mA cm(-2) (275 times higher than that of the undoped alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays) at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) and a 150-mV cathodic shift of photocurrent onset potential. The enhanced photoelectrochemical performance was ascribed to the synergistic effect of the one-dimensional nanoarray structure and the Ti elemental doping, which increased donor density and reduced photogenerated electron-hole recombination.

The present study demonstrates, for the first-time, plutonium leaching from different refractory matrices: oxide, mixed oxide as well as simulated cellulosic waste using the benign halide anion free choline citrate - urea (1 : 2 mole ratio) based eutectic solvent (referred to as CU). This mineral acid and hydrofluoric acid-free, non-aqueous route of plutonium recovery with controlled infra-red heating yielded.93% efficiency. CU was diluted with biodegradable, less viscous propylene glycol (referred to as PG), which was chosen as the non-aqueous polar phase for facile solid phase extraction (SPE), which is a green alternative to liquid-liquid extraction owing to process simplification and solvent inventory reduction. Exclusive stabilization of tetravalent plutonium in the novel media, confirmed by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and electrochemical methods, led to process simplification, eliminating any pre-extraction requirement for oxidation state adjustment. Extractant, di-2-ethyl hexyl phosphoric acid encapsulated polyether sulfone beads, prepared by phase inversion method, were employed for efficient SPE of plutonium (Distribution co-efficient, k(D)=950 +/- 6). Selectivity of non-aqueous SPE was found to be Pu(IV)>>UO22+> Am(III) vis-a-vis aqueous acid medium.

Despite their essential role in the nitrogen cycle in high-temperature ecosystems, they remain poorly understood because they have never been isolated in pure culture, and very few genomes are available. In the present study, a metagenomics approach was employed to obtain "Ca. Nitrosocaldaceae" metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs) from hot spring samples collected from India and China. Phylogenomic analysis placed these MAGs within "Ca. Nitrosocaldaceae." Average nucleotide identity and average amino acid identity analysis suggested the new MAGs represent two novel species of "Candidatus Nitrosocaldus" and a novel genus, herein proposed as "Candidatus Nitrosothermus." Key genes responsible for chemolithotrophic ammonia oxidation and a thaumarchaeal 3HP/4HB cycle were detected in all MAGs. Furthermore, genes coding for urea degradation were only present in "Ca. Nitrosocaldus," while biosynthesis of the vitamins, biotin, cobalamin, and riboflavin were detected in almost all MAGs. Comparison of "Ca. Nitrosocaldales/Nitrosocaldaceae" with other AOA revealed 526 specific orthogroups. This included genes related to thermal adaptation (cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase), indicating their importance for life at high temperature. In addition, these MAGs acquired genes from members from archaea (Crenarchaeota) and bacteria (Firmicutes), mainly involved in metabolism and stress responses, which might play a role to allow this group to adapt to thermal habitats.

The CeO2-PEDOT composite was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The MWCNTs/CeO2-PEDOT modified electrode was used for the sensitive analysis of dopamine (DA) in the presence of uric acid (UA) and ascorbic acid (AA) for the first time. Compared with a bare GCE, the MWCNTs/CeO2-PEDOT modified GCE exhibited a more effective electrocatalytic performance with regard to the oxidation of DA. Under optimum conditions, the prepared GCE/MWCNTs/CeO2-PEDOT sensor showed two wide linear ranges of 0.10-10 mu mol L-1 and 40-400 mu mol L-1 with a good detection limit of 0.03 mu mol L-1. Important effects of interferences such as Ca2+, K+, Na+, glucose, urea, sucrose, citric acid and cystine were not observed on the differential pulse response of dopamine for the prepared sensor. In addition, the sensor designed as a new platform was successfully utilized for the electrochemical analysis of DA in pharmaceutical samples.

The mice were divided into the NC, cisplatin and cisplatin + YSJZD groups. A concentration-dependent effect of YSJZD on cisplatin-induced AKI was observed and the optimal concentration for intervention was calculated. Changes in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels combined with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff staining and transmission electron microscopy observations indicated that YSJZD enhanced renal function, reduced pathological injury and protected renal tubular epithelial cells in cisplatin-induced AKI mice. The results of the transcriptomic and enrichment analyses showed that the mechanisms of YSJZD may be associated with inflammation, oxidation, apoptosis and the TNF signal pathway. Immunofluorescence, oxidative stress index, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and western blotting revealed that YSJZD downregulated apoptosis in the renal tissues of AKI mice and further decreased the expression levels of p-p65, p-p38 MAPK, TNF-alpha, cleaved-caspase-3 and malondialdehyde, while increasing the levels of NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-3, glutathione and superoxide dismutase. Overall, the results showed that YSJZD could effectively abrogate cisplatin-induced AKI in mice through mechanisms primarily related to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects by inhibited the TNF signal pathway. YSJZD warrants further investigation as a clinical empirical prescription.

J	Zou, L; Mai, CY; Li, MY; Lai, YF				Zou, Li; Mai, Chuoying; Li, Mengyan; Lai, Yufen			Smartphone-assisted colorimetric sensing of enzyme-substrate system using pH-responsive gold nanoparticle assembly	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA												Gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based colorimetric biosensors have been widely used for pH sensing and monitoring its changes. However, few AuNP-based pH sensors have been developed through the manipulation of the aggregation states of AuNPs via i-motif DNA. We herein report i-motif DNA-assisted pH-responsive gold nanoparticle assembly (termed RGA), which shows a reversible and highly sensitive response to pH variation between 6.20 and 7.40. The acidic pH triggers the disassembly of the RGA, thus converting the AuNPs from aggregation state to disperse state, which leads to a color transition from blue-purple to red. Therefore, the pH value can be estimated by naked-eye determination or UVevis spectroscopy analysis. More significantly, the visually detectable color change is monitored using the built-in camera of a smartphone. The RGB (red, green, blue) values of the RGA solution are measured by a smartphone application (APP). Following data processing, the RGB values can be converted into pH value, providing a new strategy for the on-site and real-time pH sensing. Furthermore, the pH-induced conformation change of i-motif DNA allows the RGA to detect a slight pH fluctuation in the catalytic oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase and the hydrolysis of urea by urease.

The hepatocyte proteome in organotypic rat liver models and the influence of the local microenvironment	PROTEOME SCIENCE												Background: Liver models that closely mimic the in vivo microenvironment are useful for understanding liver functions, capabilities, and intercellular communication processes. Three-dimensional (3D) liver models assembled using hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) separated by a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) provide a functional system while also permitting isolation of individual cell types for proteomic analyses. Methods: To better understand the mechanisms and processes that underlie liver model function, hepatocytes were maintained as monolayers and 3D PEM-based formats in the presence or absence of primary LSECs. The resulting hepatocyte proteomes, the proteins in the PEM, and extracellular levels of urea, albumin and glucose after three days of culture were compared. Results: All systems were ketogenic and found to release glucose. The presence of the PEM led to increases in proteins associated with both mitochondrial and peroxisomal-based beta-oxidation. The PEMs also limited production of structural and migratory proteins associated with dedifferentiation. The presence of LSECs increased levels of Phase I and Phase II biotransformation enzymes as well as several proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular matrix remodeling. The proteomic analysis of the PEMs indicated that there was no significant change after three days of culture. These results are discussed in relation to liver model function. Conclusions: Heterotypic cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions exert different effects on hepatocyte functions and phenotypes.

J	Crandell, DW; Zhu, HY; Yang, XF; Hochmuth, J; Baik, MH				Crandell, Douglas W.; Zhu, Haiyang; Yang, Xiaofan; Hochmuth, John; Baik, Mu-Hyun			Computational and spectroscopic characterization of key intermediates of the Selective Catalytic Reduction cycle of NO on zeolite-supported Cu catalyst	INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA												Chabazite supported Cu is a promising catalyst platform for implementing a NH3/urea-based Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to remove hazardous NOx gases from lean-burn engine exhaust. Whereas in-depth spectroscopic and other studies have attempted to identify key features of the catalytic cycle previously, a deep understanding of the SCR mechanism amenable to systematic improvement of catalyst performance remains elusive. For example, neither the precise Cu coordination geometry at the active site nor the substrate binding affinities to the catalytic center are known. To establish a more rational approach to catalyst optimization based on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the key steps of the underlying NOx-transformations we developed a quantum chemical model and benchmarked it to match vibrational data from Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy resulting in plausible assignments of each observable intermediate to specific oxidation states of Cu and NO-binding properties. Among these intermediates, we identified the structure of a lattice supported NO+ cation species, expected to be reactive towards NH3, corresponding to a high frequency IR-absorption at 2170 cm(-1). This approach enables a more precise assignment of the experimental vibrational data to key intermediates potentially involved in the catalytic cycle in order to develop a micromechanistic proposal for the catalysis that is chemically meaningful and is logically consistent.

A response surface methodology (RSM) combined with the central composite design (CCD) was applied to model and optimize the synthetic conditions. RESULTS As a result, the optimum NOx conversion of 95.6% and N-2 selectivity of 81.8% were obtained at Mn/Co 2.1, urea/(Mn + Co) mole ratio 11.5, glucose/(Mn + Co) mole ratio 8.9, preparation temperature 175.4 degrees C, and calcination temperature 376.3 degrees C. The SEM (Scanning electron microscope) image and EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy) analysis showed that metal oxides of Mn and Co were uniformly accumulated on the carbon microsphere surface. XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns showed that CoCo2O4 content in the catalyst increased with the increase of the glucose/(Mn + Co) mole ratio, which reduced the interaction between Mn and Co, and played a negative impact on catalytic performance. FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) spectra showed that the catalyst surface in the optimum preparation conditions had more oxygen-containing functional groups and that the excessive glucose carbon was unfavourable to catalytic performance. For urea/(Mn + Co), as urea/(Mn + Co) decreased, in addition to the decrease in Mn and Co content in the catalyst due to the decrease in precipitant, CoCo2O4 content in the catalyst also increased and oxygen-containing functional groups decreased, both of which resulted in the decrease of the catalytic performance. CONCLUSION The H-2-TPR and NH3-TPD results demonstrated that the catalyst prepared in the optimum conditions possessed a stronger reducing ability, more acid sites, and stronger acid strength than the other.

Oxidative stress as evident by increased malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, advanced oxidation protein product, protein carbonyl, with significant decrease in non protein thiol and glutathione contents, as well as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase activities. Paracetamol triggered inflammatory response by inducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), with the increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). Paracetamol also increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate deshydrogenase (LDH) activities, along with an increase in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total bilirubin levels. LAPHs were found to decrease leakage of LDH and ALP activity and attenuate the increase in biochemical parameters resulted in a subsequent recovery towards normalization. The biochemical parameters and histopathological observation were correlated by regulation of Cox-2, and TNF-alpha expression. PH-LA, which presented the highest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, was fractionated by G-25 chromatography into five fractions. F2 and F4 which exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, respectively, were further fractionated by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. Our findings claimed that PH-LA can be used in preventing and treating many health problems without any side effects and can be applied in the field of nutraceuticals.

Herein, the photocatalytic ozonation treatment using graphitic carbon nitride catalysts was effectively applied for the elimination of a mixture of targeted chemical contaminants, and both Escherichia coli bacteria and Human polyomavirus JC (JC virus) in real secondary wastewater. The exfoliation treatment was compared in catalysts prepared using urea and melamine as precursors. The physical treatment provided no significant enhancement in the urea-based catalyst, while the improvement in the structure of the melaminebased (36MCN) material and formation of melem heterojunction increased its catalytic properties. In both sets of contaminants, the photocatalytic ozonation systems were superior to photolytic ozonation, especially regarding ozone consumption. The best catalyst, 36MCN, resulted in a decrease of 57.5%, 33.0% and 29.0% in the ozone dose required to eliminate chemical, bacteria and virus contaminants, respectively. The hydroxyl radicals were also shown as a key responsible for the pollutant's elimination. The higher radical production and decomposition of ozone are possible indications of the better performance of graphitic carbon nitride photocatalytic ozonation, as an efficient tertiary wastewater alternative.

We have shown in previous work that an AdSCR system can capture and store NOx at room temperature from Diesel engine exhausts, and directly reduce them with ammonia at higher temperatures in the same unit. The present work aims at optimizing the system composition, in order to minimize the release of NOx in the low temperature window. Results from cold start mimicking experiments show that the full storage time, i.e. the zero-emission period where the fed NO is completely adsorbed by the catalyst, is affected only by the amount and the composition of the storage material, whereas the NOx storage efficiency is controlled by amount and nature of both components of the physical mixture.

Microwave assisted hydrothermal synthesis of N doped graphene for supercapacitor applications	DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS												Nitrogen doped graphene (N-G) has emerged as an important candidate for a plethora of sustainable future applications in recent years. Adatom doping of graphene results in significantly improved physical and chemical properties there by increasing its efficiency for multiple applications. In this work N-G has been synthesized in <6 min using 6-layered Graphene oxide (GO) and urea in a microwave digestion tank (DC). Under microwave irradiations, hydrothermal environment was created in DC while covered vessel (OP) sample was synthesized at atmospheric pressure. This leads to incorporation of significant amount of nitrogen (1.90 %) within graphene in DC sample as compared to the OP sample. The morphological, chemical and structural analysis of synthesized samples was done using Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray Diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The (I-D/I-G) ratio obtained from Raman analysis reveals the presence of defect structures in the synthesized samples. Further, the electrochemical supercapacitance performance was checked for the synthesized samples in 1 M H2SO4 acidic electrolyte. Amongst all the samples prepared, DC400 showed good specific capacitance of 97.05 Fg(-1) at scan rate of 2 mV/s. Detailed analysis shows that the samples have pseudocapacitive behavior and enhanced charge storage capacity indicating effective nitrogen infusion in GO. The bonding configuration of doped N atoms plays a key role in enhancing electrochemical properties of N-G. Hence, DC400 sample can be utilized efficiently as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.

This study investigated the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and N-4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (acetyl-SMX) in synthetic fresh and hydrolyzed human urines by low-pressure UV, and UV combined with H2O2 and peroxydisulfate (PDS). The objective was to compare the two advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and assess the impact of urine matrices. All three compounds reacted quickly in the AOPs, exhibiting rate constants of (6.09-8.53) x 10(9) M-1.s(-1) with hydroxyl radical, and (2.35-16.1) x 10(9) M-1.s(-1) with sulfate radical. In fresh urine matrix, the pharmaceuticals' indirect photolysis was significantly suppressed by the scavenging effect of urine citrate and urea. In hydrolyzed urine matrix, the indirect photolysis was strongly affected by inorganic urine constituents. Chloride had no apparent impact on UV/H2O2, but significantly raised the hydroxyl radical concentration in UV/PDS. Carbonate species reacted with hydroxyl or sulfate radical to generate carbonate radical, which degraded SMX and TMP, primarily due to the presence of aromatic amino group(s) (k = 2.68 x 10(8) and 3.45 x 10(7) M-1.s(-1)) but reacted slowly with acetyl-SMX. Ammonia reacted with hydroxyl or sulfate radical to generate reactive nitrogen species that could react appreciably only with SMX. Kinetic simulation of radical concentrations, along with products analysis, helped elucidate the major reactive species in the pharmaceuticals' degradation. Overall, the AOPs' performance was higher in the hydrolyzed urine than fresh urine matrix with UV/PDS better than UV/H2O2, and varied significantly depending on pharmaceutical's structure.

Strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in intensively managed vegetable cropping systems in subtropical Australia	SOIL RESEARCH												The greenhouse gas fluxes and effective mitigation strategies in subtropical vegetable cropping systems remain unclear. In this field experiment, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes from an irrigated lettuce cropping system in subtropical Queensland, Australia, were measured using manual sampling chambers. Four treatments were included: Control (no fertiliser), U100 (100kg N ha(-1) as urea), U200 (200kg N ha(-1) as urea) and N100 (100kg N ha(-1) as nitrate-based fertilisers). The N fertilisers were applied in three splits and irrigation was delivered sparingly and frequently to keep soil moisture around the field capacity. The cumulative N2O emissions from the control, U100, U200 and N100 treatments over the 68-day cropping season were 30, 151, 206 and 68g N2O-N ha(-1), respectively. Methane emission and uptake were negligible. Using N2O emission from the Control treatment as the background emission, direct emission factors for U100, U200 and N100 treatments were 0.12%, 0.09% and 0.04% of applied fertiliser N, respectively. Soil ammonium (NH4+) concentration, instead of nitrate (NO3-) concentration, exhibited a significant correlation with N2O emissions at the site where the soil moisture was controlled within 50%-64% water-filled pore space. Furthermore, soil temperature rather than water content was the main regulating factor of N2O fluxes in the fertilised treatments. Fertiliser type and application rates had no significant effects on yield parameters. Partial N balance analysis indicated that approximately 80% and 52% of fertiliser N was recovered in plants and soil in the treatments receiving 100kg N ha(-1) and 200kg N ha(-1), respectively. Therefore, in combination with frequent and low-intensity irrigation and split application of fertiliser N, substitution of NO3--based fertilisers for urea and reduction in fertiliser N application rates were considered promising mitigation strategies to maintain yield and minimise N2O emissions during the low rainfall season.

The catalytic performance of the samples was studied in the methanol steam reforming process for fuel cell grade hydrogen production. The physicochemical properties of the prepared nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET and FTIR analysis. XRD analysis shows that the homogeneous precipitation method and CeO2 addition improves the dispersion and decreases the relative crystallinity of CuO and ZnO species. FESEM images illustrate that the homogeneous precipitation method is more capable of the synthesis of smaller particles than the urea-nitrate combustion method. Addition of ceria to the fabricated catalysts decreases the particle size and enhances surface homogeneity. EDX analysis demonstrates that Cu and Zn elements are homogeneously dispersed on the catalyst surface, which is synthesized by a homogeneous precipitation method.

Water electrolysis, specifically the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), offers a cleaner option. Although HER is the favorable process, OER needs a larger overpotential, thereby hindering practical implementation. The use of expensive noble metal-based catalysts limits the application. The levelized cost of hydrogen can be lowered by replacing the anodic reaction with several innovative strategies. Alternative oxidation reactions have emerged as some of the most noteworthy new strategies. A critical analysis of electrochemical synthesis reactions (ESR) combining anodic chemical synthesis and cathodic hydrogen evolution is presented here for replacing the traditional OER with organic molecule oxidation. This review aims to explore nickel and nickel-based catalysts for different ESR reactions, such as alcohol, aldehydes, amines, and biomass-derived compounds, for energy-efficient and cost-effective electrocatalytic hydrogen production. In this critical review, we present a clear picture of the challenges and bottlenecks associated with electrochemical synthesis reactions as a method of industrial hydrogen production needs. Finally, a perspective and challenges for future development of the hybrid water electrolysis techniques are demonstrated.

At first, a 68.0% MA yield was achieved in a homogeneous reaction system catalyzed by KBr-KOH. Next, a series of K-doped g-C3N4 catalysts with various potassium salts (KBr, KCl, KNO3, and KOH) was synthesized and tested for the conversion of furfural to MA, 2-buten-1,4-olide (FRO), and succinic acid (SA). When comparing the various K-doped g-C3N4 catalysts, KBr/g-C3N4 enhanced MA selectivity, which resulted in complete furfural conversion and a 70.4% MA yield (at 100 degrees C for 180 min). Furthermore, a synergistic interaction was observed between KBr and the g-C3N4 support, which could explain why KBr/g-C3N4 had the highest MA selectivity.																			1930-2126					AUG	2019	14	3					5025	5044		10.15376/biores.14.3.5025-5044	http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.14.3.5025-5044													WOS:000473204700007

Selective 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation by gold nanoparticles deposited & precipitated onto nanocarbon materials	RSC ADVANCES												Graphene oxide and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were chemically modified by treatment with urea and subsequent annealing at different temperatures. These materials were used as supports for gold nanoparticles and the resulting samples have been applied as catalysts in the 1,3-butadiene partial hydrogenation reaction. The supports and catalysts were exhaustively characterized. It was shown that urea treatments modified the graphene surfaces and the morphology of CNTs, in both cases with incorporation of significant amounts of different nitrogen surface groups. The presence of these groups on few layered graphene or on CNT surfaces modifies the gold precipitation-deposition process during catalyst preparation, giving place to different amounts of incorporated gold on the various supports. The obtained catalytic results suggested that the partial hydrogenation requires limited availability of hydrogen, and for this the migration through adsorbed species between the metal and support to initiate the hydrogenation, probably by a spillover mechanism, seems to be a required step. In general intramolecular selectivity is structure-sensitive meanwhile catalytic activity is not structure-sensitive, as evidenced when the gold nanoparticle sizes are decreased.

Hypertrophic muscle growth and metabolic efficiency were impaired by chronic heat stress, improved by zilpaterol supplementation, and not affected by ractopamine supplementation in feedlot lambs	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Feedlot performance is reduced by heat stress and improved by beta adrenergic agonists (beta AA). However, the physiological mechanisms underlying these outcomes are not well characterized, and anecdotal reports suggest that beta AA may confound the effects of heat stress on wellbeing. Thus, we sought to determine how heat stress and beta AA affect growth, metabolic efficiency, and health indicators in lambs on a feedlot diet. Wethers (38.6 +/- 1.9 kg) were housed under thermoneutral (controls; n = 25) or heat stress (n = 24) conditions for 21 d. In a 2 x 3 factorial, their diets contained no supplement (unsupplemented), ractopamine (beta 1AA), or zilpaterol (beta 2AA). Blood was collected on days -3, 3, 9, and 21. On day 22, lambs were harvested and ex vivo skeletal muscle glucose oxidation was determined to gauge metabolic efficiency. Feet and organ tissue damage was assessed by veterinary pathologists. Heat stress reduced (P < 0.05) feed intake by 21%, final bodyweight (BW) by 2.6 kg, and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle mass by 5%. beta 2AA increased (P < 0.05) FDS mass/BW by 9% and average muscle fiber area by 13% compared with unsupplemented lambs. Blood lymphocytes and monocytes were greater (P < 0.05) in heat-stressed lambs, consistent with systemic inflammation. Plasma insulin was 22% greater (P < 0.05) and glucose/insulin was 16% less (P < 0.05) in heat-stressed lambs than controls. Blood plasma urea nitrogen was increased (P < 0.05) by heat stress on day 3 but reduced (P < 0.05) on days 9 and 21. Plasma lipase and lactate dehydrogenase were reduced (P < 0.05) by heat stress. Glucose oxidation was 17% less (P < 0.05) in muscle from heat-stressed lambs compared with controls and 15% greater (P < 0.05) for beta 2AA-supplemented compared with unsupplemented lambs. Environment and supplement interacted (P < 0.05) for rectal temperature, which was increased (P < 0.05) by heat stress on all days but more so (P < 0.05) in beta 2AA-supplemented lambs on days 4, 9, and 16. Heat stress increased (P < 0.05) the frequency of hoof wall overgrowth, but beta AA did not produce any pathologies. We conclude that reduced performance in heat-stressed lambs was mediated by reduced feed intake, muscle growth, and metabolic efficiency. beta 2AA increased muscle growth and improved metabolic efficiency by increasing muscle glucose oxidation, but no such effects were observed with ractopamine. Finally, beta AA supplementation was not detrimental to health indicators in this study, nor did it worsen the effects of heat stress.

In addition, the study of the effects of nitrification and urease inhibitors on N and microorganisms in greenhouse vegetable fields is essential to reducing N loss and greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of nitrification inhibitors [2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine (CP), dicyandiamide (DCD)], and urease inhibitor [N-(n-butyl) thiophos-phoric triamide (NBPT)] on soil inorganic N (NH4+-N, NO2-N and NO3-N) concentrations and the production rates of greenhouse gases (N2O, CH4, and CO2) in greenhouse vegetable fields were investigated via indoor incubation experiments. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and high-throughput sequencing technology (Illumina Miseq) were used to explore the community structure and abundance changes of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and denitrifying bacteria (nirK and nirS). The results showed that CP and DCD obviously inhibited NH4+-N conversion, and NO2-N, and NO3-N accumulation, NBPT slowed down urea hydrolysis and NH4+-N production, and the apparent nitrification rates of soil were in the following order: NBPT > DCD > DCD + NBPT > CP + NBPT > CP. Compared with urea treatment, the peak N2O production rate of inhibitor treatment decreased by 73.30-99.30%, and the production rate of CH4 and CO2 decreased by more than 66.16%. DCD and CP reduced the abundance of AOA and AOB, respectively. Further-more, NBPT hindered the growth of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria, and urea and nitrification inhibitors were detrimental to the growth of Ensifer and Sinorhizobium in the nirK com-munity. Nitrification and urease inhibitors can effectively slow down nitrification and greenhouse gas emissions, reduce N loss and improve soil quality by inhibiting the growth of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and denitrifying bacteria.

Moreover, the anode product, O-2, which is of rather low value, may lead to dangerous explosions and the generation of membrane-degrading reactive oxygen species. Herein, to address these issues of electrocatalytic H-2 production, we summarize the most recent advances in three stages based on the benefit increments and various electron donation routes, which are: 1) electron donation by traditional OER: developing efficient catalysts for water oxidation to promote H-2 production; 2) electron donation by the oxidation of sacrificial agents: using sacrificial agents to assist H-2 production; 3) electron donation by electrosynthesis reaction: achieving electrosynthesis in parallel with cathodic H-2 production. Present challenges and related prospects will also be discussed, hopefully to benefit the further progress of electrocatalytic H-2 generation.					chen, lisong/IAN-2223-2023; wei, xinfa/LTC-5519-2024; , jianlin Shi/HTM-8889-2023	Wei, Xinfa/0009-0002-1600-4789; , chen li song/0000-0001-9358-5842													1433-7851	1521-3773				SEP 1	2021	60	36					19550	19571		10.1002/anie.202009854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.202009854		MAR 2021						32914487					WOS:000630077000001

Peanut cake as a substitute for soybean meal in the diet of goats	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE					Joint Meeting of the American-Dairy-Science-Association, Amer-Society-of Animal-Science, and the Canadian-Society-of-Animal-Science	JUL 20-24, 2014	Kansas City, MO	Amer Dairy Sci Assoc, Amer Soc Animal Sci, Canadian Soc Animal Sci				This study aimed to test the hypothesis that peanut cake can substitute for soybean meal in the feed of ruminants on the basis of the intake, performance, digestion, and serum urea and glucose concentration in crossbred Boer x indigenous goat kids. Forty intact vaccinated and dewormed crossbred Boer x indigenous goat kids (average age = 5 mo, average BW = 15.6 +/- 2.7 kg) were used. The goats were fed Tifton-85 (Cynodon dactylon) hay and concentrate mixes of corn bran, soybean meal, premix mineral, and peanut cake substituted for soybean meal at rates of 0.0%, 33.33%, 66.67%, and 100%. The animals were confined for 62 d, and the digestibility trial was performed from d 27 to 31 of confinement. Samples of orts and feces were quantified and collected from each animal during this period. On the d 32 of confinement, a blood sample was taken from animals to measure urea N and glucose. Data were analyzed with a regression model. Substitution of soybean meal with peanut cake in the diet of the animals resulted in a reduction in intake of DM (P = 0.02), CP (P = 0.03), NDF (P = 0.03), nonfiber carbohydrate (NFC; P = 0.01), and TDN (P = 0.02) and an increase in intake of ether extract (P < 0.001). The total and daily average weight gains decreased (P = 0.02) with substitution, whereas G: F was not influenced (P = 0.11). With the exception of ether extract digestibility, which increased (P < 0.001) with substitution, digestibility of DM (P = 0.13), OM (P = 0.18), CP (P = 0.54), NDF (P = 0.20), and NFC (P = 0.73) was not influenced by diets. The concentration of serum urea N was influenced quadratically by the postprandial time for treatments with 33.33%, 66.67%, and 100.00% substitution. Peanut cake is not a complete, equal substitute for soybean meal in goat feed. However, peanut cake may represent an eventual replacer able to reduce goat producers' dependence on traditional ingredients in the feed of growing goat kids.

Improving nitrogen fertilization management practices through the use of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) can reduce GHGs emissions. We conducted a field experiment at the Colombian Agricultural Research Corporation with four fertilization treatments: urea (typical fertilizer used in this region), ammonium sulfate nitrate (ASN), ASN plus the NI 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (ASN+DMPP), and an unfertilized control. The highest grassland yields (1956 and 2057 kg DM ha(-1), respectively) and apparent fertilizer nitrogen recoveries (34% and 33%, respectively) were generated by the conventional urea fertilizer and ASN+DMPP. Furthermore, the use of ASN+DMPP reduced the N2O emissions that were related to N fertilization to the level of the unfertilized treatment (ca. 1.5 g N2O-N ha(-1)), with a significant reduction of N-yield-scaled N2O emissions (ca. 20 g N2O-N kg N uptake(-1)). These results support the application of DMPP as an alternative strategy to increase grassland yield while simultaneously reducing the environmental impact of N fertilization.

This study explored the interactions between CIGB-258 and apoA-I in the lipid-free state to assess their synergistic effects in the structural and functional enhancement of apoA-I and HDL. A co-treatment of lipid-free apoA-I and CIGB-258 inhibited the cupric ion-mediated oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a lowering of oxidized species in the dose-responsive manner of CIGB-258. The co-presence of CIGB-258 caused a blue shift in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence (WMF) of apoA-I with protection from proteolytic degradation. The addition of apoA-I:CIGB-258, with a molar ratio of 1:0.1, 1:0.5, and 1:1, to HDL2 and HDL3 remarkably enhanced the antioxidant ability against LDL oxidation up to two-fold higher than HDL alone. HDL-associated paraoxonase activities were elevated up to 28% by the co-addition of apoA-I and CIGB-258, which is linked to the suppression of Cu2+-mediated HDL oxidation with the slowest electromobility. Isothermal denaturation by a urea treatment showed that the co-presence of CIGB-258 attenuated the exposure of intrinsic tryptophan (Trp) and increased the mid-points of denaturation from 2.33 M for apoA-I alone to 2.57 M for an apoA-I:CIGB-258 mixture with a molar ratio of 1:0.5. The addition of CIGB-258 to apoA-I protected the carboxymethyllysine (CML)-facilitated glycation of apoA-I with the prevention of Trp exposure. A co-treatment of apoA-I and CIGB-258 synergistically safeguarded zebrafish embryos from acute death by CML-toxicity, suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis. In adult zebrafish, the co-treatment of apoA-I+CIGB-258 exerted the highest anti-inflammatory activity with a higher recovery of swimming ability and survivability than apoA-I alone or CIGB-258 alone. A co-injection of apoA-I and CIGB-258 led to the lowest infiltration of neutrophils and interleukin (IL)-6 generation in hepatic tissue, with the lowest serum triglyceride, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase levels in plasma. In conclusion, the co-presence of CIGB-258 ameliorated the beneficial functionalities of apoA-I, such as antioxidant and anti-glycation activities, by enhancing the structural stabilization and protection of apoA-I. The combination of apoA-I and CIGB-258 synergistically enforced the anti-inflammatory effect against CML toxicity in embryos and adult zebrafish.						cho, Kyung-Hyun/0000-0003-1198-4140													1661-6596	1422-0067				MAY	2024	25	10							5560	10.3390/ijms25105560	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms25105560								38791598					WOS:001233310600001

The samples of g-C3N4 prepared using urea, thiourea and thiourea-urea complexes as precursors were named CN-U, CN-T and CN-TU, respectively. In addition, CN-M was prepared by physically mixing CN-U and CN-T. The structure, morphology, optical and electronic properties of the prepared samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR spectra, SEM-EDS, BET, XPS and DRS. The photocatalytic activities of the synthesized samples were estimated by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB), Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and antibiotic tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) in the presence of visible light. Compared with other as-prepared samples, the ternary 1%CN-TU/BiOBr photocatalyst exhibited an excellent activity, which is attributed to the construction of the ternary Delta(Z + H)-scheme not only benefit to maintain outstanding redox capability of the electrons, but also facilitates the separation of photo-generated carrier. Furthermore, the stability of the sample is tested by cyclic experiments. This work will provided a new insight into optimizing the structure and designing similar Z-scheme photocatalytic system.

In this study, NCC-x were synthesized via a facile thermal polymerization method using urea and terephthalaldehyde as precursors. This method was derived from the polymerization method of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and the reaction between the precursors was based on Schiff base chemistry. Compared with the synthesis of gC(3)N(4) using urea as the precursor, formation of a melamine ring was inhibited and the cyano groups were produced in NCC-x during the polymerization process. The obtained NCC-x catalysts had high specific surface areas, many graphite-nitrogen active sites, and high degrees of graphitization, thus exhibiting excellent activities for the degradation of bisphenol A via PMS activation. This study introduces a convenient method to obtain a highly efficient nitrogen-containing carbon PMS activator and the results are useful for the development of bisphenol A treatment by PMS activation using carbon-containing materials.

Branched-Chain Amino Acid Catabolism and Cardiopulmonary Function Following Acute Maximal Exercise Testing in Adolescents	FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE												Background: To provide energy for cardiopulmonary function and maintenance of blood glucose, acute aerobic exercise induces lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), glycolysis, and glycogenolysis/gluconeogenesis. These adaptations are mediated by increases in cortisol, growth hormone (GH), and catecholamines and facilitated by a decline in insulin. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) also undergo catabolism during intense exercise. Here, we investigated the relationship between BCAA catabolism and metrics of cardiopulmonary function in healthy, well-developed, mature adolescent athletes undergoing an acute bout of maximal aerobic exercise. Hypothesis: We hypothesized: (a) acute maximal exercise in adolescents induces lipolysis, FAO, and BCAA catabolism associated with increases in GH and cortisol and a reduction in insulin; (b) increases in GH are associated with increases in ghrelin; and (c) metrics of cardiopulmonary function (aVO(2), rVO(2), aVO(2)/HRmax) following maximal exercise correlate with increases in GH secretion, FAO, and BCAA catabolism. Methods: Blood samples before and after maximal cardiopulmonary exercise in 11 adolescent athletes were analyzed by tandem-mass spectrometry. Paired, two-tailed student's t-tests identified significant changes following exercise. Linear regression determined if pre-exercise metabolite levels, or changes in metabolite levels, were associated with aVO(2), rVO(2), and aVO(2)/HRmax. Sex and school of origin were included as covariates in all regression analyses. Results: Following exercise there were increases in GH and cortisol, and decreases in ghrelin, but no changes in glucose or insulin concentrations. Suggesting increased lipolysis and FAO, the levels of glycerol, ketones, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetylcarnitine concentrations increased. Pyruvate, lactate, alanine, and glutamate concentrations also increased. Plasma concentrations of valine (a BCAA) declined (p = 0.002) while valine degradation byproducts increased in association with decreases in urea cycle amino acids arginine and ornithine. Metrics of cardiopulmonary function were associated with increases in propionylcarnitine (C3, p = 0.013) and Ci4-DC/C4-DC (p < 0.01), byproducts of BCAA catabolism. Conclusions: Induction of lipolysis, FAO, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis provides critical substrates for cardiopulmonary function during exercise. However, none of those pathways were significantly associated with metrics of cardiopulmonary function. The associations between rVO(2), and aVO(2)/HRmax and C3 and Ci4-DC/C4-DC suggest that the cardiopulmonary response to maximal exercise in adolescents is linked to BCAA utilization and catabolism.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Although one-time application of a single polymer-coated urea (PCU) can minimize the N loss in paddy field and improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in relative to rapid-release urea (RU), it shows a uncertainty in increasing rice yield. There is a proposal that one-time application of PCU mixed with RU can synergistically increase grain yield and NUE. However, few studies focus on the response of roots and rhizospheric bacteria to the nitrogen (N) management. We investigated the issue based on a two-year field experiment using an indica-japonica hybrid variety Yongyou 2640, with four N managements including N omission (0 N), split application of RU (Control), one-time application of 100 % PCU (T1) and one-time application of 70% PCU + 30 % RU (T2). Results showed that, compared with those in the control, grain yield and total number of spikelets were significantly increased in the T2 treatment while they were comparable in the T1 treatment. Both T1 and T2 remarkably increased N recovery efficiency (REN). N ). During booting, the highest alpha diversity in rhizospheric bacterial communities was observed in the T2 treatment, followed by T1 and control. Among the root morph-physiological traits, the redundancy analysis (RDA) highlighted the significant contribution of root oxidation activity (ROA) to bacterial communities. Additionally, the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) identified nine specific genera taxa in the T2 treatment. The abundances of these genera, particularly the Nitrospira, , highly correlated with ROA, root H+-ATPase +-ATPase activity, organic acid content, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (MBC and MBN) contents, MBC-to-MBN ratio, and the N accumulation during booting (NABT). These traits exhibited notable advantages in the T2 treatment, which contributed significantly to the grain yield, REN, N , and the total number of spikelets. Interestingly, the nitrate-N content was most significantly increased in T2, followed by T1 and control, rather than the ammonium-N content, which was also highly correlated with the abundance of Nitrospira. . In conclusion, a combination of PCU with RU could coordinate root activity and bacterial communities, especially the ROA and Nitrospira, and facilitate the consumption or cycling of nitrate-N while mitigating the risk of its mobility, leading to a remarkably increase in NABT, and consequently, synergistically increase grain yield and NUE.

CA-LDH was synthesized by a urea -hydrothermal process with ammonium citrate (CA) as the reducing agent. The PMS activation mechanism was investigated by combining batch experiments, characterization techniques, and DFT calculations. Over 98 % of CIP (20 mg/L) was degraded by the CA-LDH/PMS system within 60 min, which remained efficient in the presence of common interfering substances or over a wide pH range. DFT showed that CA was beneficial for introducing the electron transfer intermediate, namely, O-v, on CA-LDH, thereby allowing for the unique electron transfer performance of CA-LDH. Specifically, electron transfer from Co-O-v to PMS triggered the radical pathway, while electron transfer from PMS to Co-O-v triggered the nonradical pathway. Overall, this study provides a reference for the rational catalyst synthesis and the investigation of the triggering mechanism of PMS activation.

To natural cellulose based flocculants, utilization of hazardous cellulose solvent and simplification of synthetic procedure are the two urgent problems needing to be further improved. In this work, a series of natural dicarboxyl cellulose flocculants (DCCs) were one-step synthesized via Schiff-base route. The cellulose solvent (NaOH/Urea solution) was utilized during the synthesis process. The full-biodegradable flocculants avoid causing secondary pollution to environment. The chemical structure and solution property of the DCC products were characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, TGA, FESEM, charge density and zeta-potential. Kaolin suspension and effluent from paper mill were selected to evaluate the flocculation activity of the DCCs. Their flocculation performance was compared with that of commercial cationic polyacrylamide and poly aluminium chloride flocculants. The positive results showed that the NaOH/Urea solvent effectively promoted the dialdehyde cellulose (DAC) conversion to DCC in the one-step synthesis reaction. The DCCs with the carboxylate content more than 1 mmol/g exhibited steady flocculation performance to kaolin suspension in the broad pH range from 4 to 10. Its flocculation capacity to the effluent from paper mill also showed excellent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Soil multifunctionality primarily refers to the soil's ability to perform multiple functions simultaneously, particularly the functions related to the genes involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles, which are critical for ecosystem sustainability. Despite this, the effects of N and P fertilizers on the expression of genes involved in soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles, and their consequent influence on soil multifunctionality, remain unclear. To investigate this, we conducted a long-term nine-year experiment. The experimental site was fenced to prevent grazing and included four treatments: Control (no fertilizer), N (10 g N m(-2) y(-1), urea), P (5 g P m(-2) y(-1), Ca(H2PO4)(2)), and NP (10 g N and 5 g P m(-2) y(-1), urea and Ca(H2PO4)(2)). We examined the effects of these treatments on soil microbial functional gene abundance and multifunctionality. Our findings revealed that N addition altered the composition of soil microbial functional genes but did not affect functional diversity. Both N and P inputs, as well as their combination, negatively impacted soil carbon fixation and the genes encoding enzymes for the degradation of starch, hemicellulose, cellulose, and chitin. N input also disrupted soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling by inhibiting the expression of soil denitrification genes (nirS and nosZ), phytate hydrolase gene (cphy), and a phosphatase gene (phoD). Additionally, P input significantly inhibited functional genes involved in soil nitrification, denitrification, ammonification, nitrogen fixation, and ammonia oxidation processes. It also adversely affected phytate synthesis and degradation. The combined N and P inputs had a substantial negative impact on soil nitrification (hao), denitrification (narG, nirK, nirS, and norZ), ammonification (gdh), nitrogen fixation, annamox, and nitrogen reduction, and inhibited the expression of soil phosphorus cycle genes. Long-term phosphorus application was found to have a more detrimental effect on soil multifunctionality compared to nitrogen application. Furthermore, our study showed that vegetation diversity and abundance are crucial drivers of soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling functional genes and multifunctionality. We concluded that N and P inputs alter soil multifunctionality by influencing vegetation diversity; therefore, maintaining vegetation diversity is essential for sustaining soil multifunctionality.

This study aims to investigate the beneficial impact of Tempol on the progression of CKD in a rat model utilizing oxidized albumin as a biomarker.MethodsAfter four weeks of treatment, metabolic parameters, including body weight, left ventricle residual weight, kidney weight, urine volume, and water and food intake, were measured. Systolic blood pressure, urinary protein, oxidized albumin level, serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 8-OHdG, TGF-beta 1, and micro-albumin were also assessed. Renal fibrosis was evaluated through histological and biochemical assays. P65-NF-kappa B was quantified using an immunofluorescence test, while Smad3, P65-NF-kappa B, and Collagen I were measured using western blot. TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, TGF-beta 1, Smad3, and P65-NF-kappa B were analyzed by RT-qPCR.ResultsRats in the high-salt diet group exhibited impaired renal function, characterized by elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, 8-OHdG, urine albumin, and tubulointerstitial damage, along with reduced body weight. However, these effects were significantly ameliorated by Tempol administration. In the high-salt diet group, blood pressure, urinary protein, and oxidized albumin levels were notably higher compared to the normal diet group, but Tempol administration in the treatment group reversed these effects. Rats in the high-salt diet group also displayed increased levels of proinflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP1) and profibrotic factors (NF-kappa B activation, Collagen I), elevated expression of NADPH oxidation-related subunits (P65), and activation of the TGF-beta 1/Smad3 signaling pathway. Tempol treatment inhibited NF-kappa B-mediated inflammation and TGF-beta 1/Smad3-induced renal fibrosis signaling pathway activation.ConclusionThese findings suggest that Tempol may hold therapeutic potential for preventing and treating rats undergoing 5/6 nephrectomy. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Tempol's protective effects and its potential clinical applications. Besides, there is a discernible positive relationship between oxidized albumin and other biomarkers, such as 8-OHG, urinary protein levels, mALB, Scr, BUN, and TGF-beta 1 in a High-salt diet combined with 5/6 nephrectomy rat model. These findings suggest the potential utility of oxidized albumin as a sensitive indicator for oxidative stress assessment.

Urea is a cheap reductant and can react with NOx species, and their products are nontoxic and harmless N-2, CO2 and H2O. In this study, a Wet Direct Recycling Micro-nanobubble Flue Gas Multi-pollutants Removal System (WDRMRS) was developed for the simultaneous removal of NO, SO2 and Hg-0. In this system, a micro-nanobubble generator (MNBG) was used to produce a micro-nanobubble gas-liquid dispersion system (MNBGLS) through recycling the urea solution from the reactor and the simulated flue gas composed of N-2, NO, SO2 and Hg-0. The MNBGLS, which has a large gas-liquid dispersion interface, was recycled continuously from the MNBG to the reactor, thus achieving cyclic absorption of various pollutants. All of the investigated parameters, including the initial pH and temperature of the absorbent as well as the concentrations of urea, NO and SO2 had significant effects on the NO removal efficiency but did not significantly affect the SO2 removal efficiency, whereas only the initial solution pH and NO concentration affected the Hg-0 removal efficiency. The analysis results of the reaction mechanism showed that center dot OH played a critical role in the removal of various pollutants. After the treatment by this system, the main removal products were Hg-0 sediment, SO42- and NH4+ which could be easily recycled. The use of this system (MNBGLS) for the simultaneous removal of NO, SO2 and Hg-0 is a new technology application and research. Recycling process based on MNBGLS succeeded in simultaneously removing NO, SO2 and Hg-0. The system (MNBGLS) can provide a reference for commercial applications. The removal products are relatively simple and beneficial to recycling, which can reduce the cost of waste gas treatment.

This study investigated the lipotropic benefits of choline or L-carnitine supplementation in lean and obese cats maintaining body weight (BW). MethodsLean [n = 9; body condition score (BCS): 4-5/9] and obese (n = 9; BCS: 8-9/9) adult male neutered colony cats were used in a replicated 3 x 3 complete Latin square design. Treatments included choline (378 mg/kg BW0.67), L-carnitine (200 mg/kg BW) and control (no supplement). Treatments were supplemented to the food for 6 weeks each, with a 2-week washout between treatments. Cats were fed once daily to maintenance energy requirements, and BW and BCS were assessed weekly. Fasted blood collection, indirect calorimetry, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry occurred at the end of each treatment period. Serum was analyzed for cholesterol (CHOL), high-density lipoprotein CHOL (HDL-C), triglycerides (TAG), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose, creatinine (CREAT), urea, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Very low-density lipoprotein CHOL (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein CHOL (LDL-C) were calculated. Data were analyzed using proc GLIMMIX, with group and period as random effects, and treatment, body condition, and their interaction as fixed effects, followed by a Tukey's post-hoc test when significance occurred. ResultsCats supplemented choline had lower food intake (P = 0.025). Treatment did not change BW, BCS and body composition (P > 0.05). Obese cats had greater ALP, TAG, and VLDL, and lower HDL-C compared to lean cats (P < 0.05). Choline resulted in greater CHOL, HDL-C, LDL-C and ALT (P < 0.05). L-carnitine resulted in lower CREAT (P = 0.010). Following the post-hoc test, differences between treatment means were not present for ALP (P = 0.042). No differences were found for glucose, urea or NEFA (P > 0.05). Obese cats had a lower fed respiratory quotient (RQ), regardless of treatment (P = 0.045). Treatment did not affect fed or fasted RQ and energy expenditure (P > 0.05). DiscussionCholine appeared to increase circulating lipid and lipoprotein concentrations regardless of body condition, likely through enhanced lipid mobilization and hepatic elimination. Neither dietary choline or L-carnitine altered body composition or energy metabolism in the lean or obese cats, as compared to control.																				2297-1769				JUL 26	2023	10								1198175	10.3389/fvets.2023.1198175	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2023.1198175								37565085					WOS:001043390900001

To date, 8 Candidatus genera and more than 22 species of anammox bacteria have been discovered in various anthropogenic and natural habitats, including nitrogen-polluted aquifers. In this work, anammox bacteria were detected for the first time in the groundwater ecosystem with high anthropogenic nitrogen pollution (up to 1760 mg NO3--N/L and 280 mg NH4+-N/L) and low year-round temperature (7-8 degrees C) in the zone of a uranium sludge repository. Further metagenomic analysis resulted in retrieval of metagenome-assembled genomes of 4 distinct anammox bacteria: a new genus named Ca. Frigussubterria, new species in Ca. Kuenenia, and two strains of a new species in Ca. Scalindua. Analysis of the genomes revealed essential genes involved in anammox metabolism. Both strains of Ca. Scalindua chemeplantae had a high copy number of genes encoding the cold shock proteins CspA/B, which can also function as an antifreeze protein (CspB). Ca. Kuenenia glazoviensis and Ca. Frigussubterria udmurtiae were abundant in less N-polluted site, while Ca. Scalindua chemeplantae inhabited both sites. Genes for urea utilization, reduction of insoluble Fe2O3 or MnO2, assimilatory sulfate reduction, reactive oxygen detoxification, nitrate reduction to ammonium, and putatively arsenate respiration were found. These findings enrich knowledge of the functional and phylogenetic diversity of anammox bacteria and improve understanding of the nitrogen cycle in polluted aquifers.

Drugs/nutrients from herbal medicines that prevent fatigue remain a major research focus. In China, a prescription composed of Polygonati Rhizoma and Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma has been commonly used as a herb and food nutrient, providing protection against fatigue in the clinic. To date, the mechanisms through which this prescription prevented fatigue are unknown. Here, we identified the effects of this prescription on muscle fatigue based on energy and oxidation regulation. Fatigue mouse models were produced through weight-bearing exhaustive swimming. Mice were intragastrically administered prescription extracts (1 and 2 g/kg) for four weeks. Changes in exhaustive swimming times, antifatigue biochemical indicators, oxidative status, and energy metabolism were investigated. The prescription prolonged the exhaustive swimming time of the mice. The content of lactic acid and blood urea nitrogen in the serum was also markedly reduced by the prescription. The content of liver glycogen and lactate dehydrogenase in the serum increased. The prescription also significantly reduced malondialdehyde levels and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The levels of ATPase, complexes I and II in the mitochondria of hind-leg skeletal muscle, and serum creatine kinase also increased in response to the prescription. Our results indicated that the prescription could effectively alleviate muscle fatigue status by promoting energy metabolism and antioxidation ability. The prescription therefore represents a useful drug/nutrient strategy to alleviate muscle fatigue.

Nirmalesh; Selladurai, Subramanian			Novel low temperature synthesis and electrochemical characterization of mesoporous nickel cobaltite-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite for supercapacitor application	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												A simple low temperature method was formulated for the synthesis of mesoporous nickel cobaltite and graphene-nickel cobaltite composite nanoparticles. Self-combustion of urea-nitrate complexant yields high crystalline single phase NiCo2O4 nanoparticles. As expected, graphene prevents the agglomeration of the nanoparticles and restacking of graphene sheets were avoided mutually. FTIR analysis reveals the successful reduction of RGO and composite formation. Qualitative analysis of RGO was obtained from Raman spectrum, which further confirms the composite formation. Chemical purity of the compound was evaluated from XPS studies. Nickel and cobalt ions were found to be in the mixed oxidation state typical of NiCo2O4. Porous morphology of the prepared samples was observed from the FESEM images. BET analysis reveals the significant increase in the specific surface area and mesopores distribution in the composite. Gn-NiCo demonstrates excellent capacitive performance. High specific capacity of 662.3 Cg(-1) was determined for Gn-NiCo against 485.5 Cg(-1) exhibited by bare nickel cobaltite at 5 mV/s scan rate. Composite material also shows excellent rate characteristics and long cycling stability. This superior performance can be attributed to the porous morphology and high electrical conductivity of graphene sheets. Symmetrical capacitor fabricated using Gn-NiCo electrode material operates within 0-0.8 V potential window. Specific capacity of 169.6 Cg(-1) was obtained in the real capacitor mode. Gn-NiCo prepared by combustion technique is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Synthesis and Structure of ZnO-Decorated Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4) with Improved Photocatalytic Activity under Visible Light	INORGANICS												The volume of dye production in the chemical industry is growing rapidly every year. Given the global importance of clean water resources, new wastewater treatment solutions are required. Utilizing photocatalysis by harvesting solar energy represents a facile and promising solution for removing dangerous pollutants. This study reports the possibility of increasing the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 by creating nanocomposites with ZnO. Exfoliated g-C3N4/ZnO nanocomposites were synthesized by heat treatment of urea and subsequent ultrasonic exfoliation of the colloidal solution by introducing zinc acetate. The uniformity of the distribution of ZnO nanoparticles is confirmed by the method of elemental mapping. The obtained X-ray diffractograms of the obtained nanocomposites show typical X-ray reflections for g-C3N4 and ZnO. It was found that the introduction of oxide into g-C3N4 leads to an increase in the specific surface area values due to the developed ZnO surface. The maximum value of the specific surface area was obtained for a sample containing 7.5% ZnO and was 75.2 m(2)/g. The g-C3N4/7.5% ZnO sample also demonstrated increased photocatalytic activity during the decomposition of methylene blue under the influence of visible light, which led to a twofold increase in the reaction rate compared to initial g-C3N4.

Despite that, the weak intrinsic activity and ease of aggregation have hampered their catalytic kinetic properties and practical application. Herein, vanadium nitride (VN) particles of different sizes, micron to molecular level, have been fabricated using a facile, in-situ urea-nitridation method, and embedded in an N-doped graphitic carbon aerogel electrocatalyst (VN@CA), the doped material serving as an oxidation catalyst. Having a balance of atomic-level dispersed VN clusters and a high active site density, the obtained VN@CA catalytic material exhibits enhanced catalytic efficiency for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the values of onset and half-wave voltages were measured to be 0.97 V and 0.90 V, respectively, compared to Pt/C (which had voltages of 0.95 V and 0.87 V). Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air battery using VN@CA as catalyst exhibits a high-power density of 176 mW cm-2, a substantial specific discharge capacity of 851 mAh gZn- 1 at 20 mA cm-2, a narrow gap between charging and discharging voltages (0.73 V at 50 mA cm-2), and an excellent charge-discharge cycling stability, exceeding 270 cycles with a 66 % round-trip efficiency. This work confirms that the particle size and the density both are responsible for the enhanced electrochemical activity.					liu, yefeng/C-6837-2011; Yin, Yanjun/CAA-2200-2022; Wang, Nannan/HSG-7186-2023; Jinpei, Hei/P-9794-2018														0925-8388	1873-4669				OCT 15	2024	1002								175346	10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175346		JUN 2024											WOS:001261559800001

The peroxide shunt pathway can be efficiently used as an alternative for the NAD(P)H and reductase systems, particularly in high hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) resistance CYPs. We reported the structural and biochemical features of CYP105D18 peroxygenase for its high H2O2 tolerance capacity. Q348 was a crucial residue for the stability of CYP105D18 during the exposure to H2O2. In addition, the role of the hydrophilic amino acid T239 from the I helix for peroxygenation and regiospecificity toward testosterone was investigated. Interestingly, T239E differs in product formation from wild type, catalyzing testosterone to androstenedione in the presence of H2O2. The other variant, T239A, worked with the Pdx/Pdr system and was unable to catalyze testosterone conversion in the presence of H2O2, suggesting the transformation of peroxygenase into monooxygenase. CYP105D18 supported the alternative method of H2O2 used for the catalysis of testosterone. The use of the same concentration of urea hydrogen peroxide adducts in place of direct H2O2 was more efficient for 2 beta-hydroxytestosterone conversion. Furthermore, in situ H2O2 generation using GOx/glucose system enhanced the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-m) for wild type and F184A by 1.3- and 1.9-fold, respectively, compared to direct use of H2O2 The engineering of CYP105D18, its improved peroxygenase activity, and alteration in the product oxidation facilitate CYP105D18 as a potential candidate for biotechnological applications.

Currently, there is no specific treatment decreasing hyperthermia-induced inflammatory/hemostatic derangements. Emerging studies indicate that histones leaking from damaged cells into the extracellular space are toxic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic. We therefore hypothesize that serum histones (sHs) are elevated during heatstroke and are associated with the severity of the disease. Sixteen dogs with heatstroke and seven healthy controls were included in the study. Median serum histones (sHs) upon admission in dogs with heatstroke were significantly higher (P = 0.043) compared to that in seven controls (13.2 vs. 7.3 ng/mL, respectively). sHs level was significantly higher among non-survivors and among dogs with severe hemostatic derangement (P = 0.049, median 21.4 ng/mL vs. median 8.16 ng/mL and P = 0.038, 19.0 vs. 7.0 ng/mL, respectively). There were significant positive correlation between sHs and urea (r = 0.8, P = 0.02); total CO2 (r = 0.661, P = 0.05); CK (r = 0.678, P = 0.04); and prothrombin time (PT) 12 h post presentation (r = 0.888, P = 0.04). The significant positive correlation between sHs and other heatstroke severity biomarkers, and significant increase among severely affected dogs, implies its role in inflammation/oxidation/coagulation during heatstroke. sHs, unlike other prognostic and severity biomarkers in heatstroke, can be pharmacologically manipulated, offering a potential therapeutic target.

Simultaneous Determination of Uric Acid and Caffeine by Flow Injection Using Multiple-Pulse Amperometry	BIOSENSORS-BASEL												The present study reports the development and application of a flow injection analysis (FIA) system for the simultaneous determination of uric acid (UA) and caffeine (CAF) using cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond electrode (CPT-BDD) and multiple-pulse amperometry (MPA). The electrochemical profiles of UA and CAF were analyzed via cyclic voltammetry in the potential range of 0.20-1.7 V using 0.10 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution as supporting electrolyte. Under optimized conditions, two oxidation peaks at potentials of 0.80 V (UA) and 1.4 V (CAF) were observed; the application of these potentials using multiple-pulse amperometry yielded concentration linear ranges of 5.0 x 10(-8)-2.2 x 10(-5) mol L-1 (UA) and 5.0 x 10(-8)-1.9 x 10(-5) mol L-1 (CAF) and limits of detection of 1.1 x 10(-8) and 1.3 x 10(-8) mol L-1 for UA and CAF, respectively. The proposed method exhibited good repeatability and stability, and no interference was detected in the electrochemical signals of UA and CAF in the presence of glucose, NaCl, KH2PO4, CaCl2, urea, Pb, Ni, and Cd. The application of the FIA-MPA method for the analysis of environmental samples resulted in recovery rates ranging between 98 and 104%. The results obtained showed that the BDD sensor exhibited a good analytical performance when applied for CAF and UA determination, especially when compared to other sensors reported in the literature.

The choice of polyindole (PIN), a conducting polymer, with the carbonaceous network or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and silver nanoparticles (Ag) embedded in the matrix is shown to be an effective sensing material for the detection of ascorbic acid in a sample. The synthesized polymer nanocomposite (PIN/rGO/Ag) was characterized by structural, morphological and spectroscopic methods. The electro-oxidation of ascorbic acid to 3-dehydro ascorbic acid (DHA) was studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The conditions of scan rate, pH and modifier concentration were optimized prior to sensing experiments. Using these optimal conditions, the ternary nanocomposite (PIN/rGO/Ag) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ascorbic acid in the linear range of 0.2-1 mM, with a sensitivity 2.93 mu A/mMcm2. The limit of detection (LOD) for ascorbic acid was calculated to be 1.5 mu M, while an LOQ value of 5.2 mu M was obtained. The presence of common interferents such as urea, glucose and dopamine did not affect the current response of the sensor towards the analyte of choice. The designed electrochemical sensor was found to be highly selective towards ascorbic acid, stable and giving reproducible results over many potential cycles.

GO was treated with urea as a nitrogen supply dopant during a hydrothermal process to produce N-rGOs. The outcomes of FT-IR, XPS, and SEM tests provided proof that N-doping in rGO was successful. By offering a conductive and adsorptive surface that facilitates the electrochemical oxidation process of 19-NT at the electrode surface, N-rGO/GCE demonstrated the greatest sensitivity, stability, and selectivity for 19-NT detection, according to electrochemical studies using cycling voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements. The sensor's linear range was found to be between 0.5 and 130 mu M, with a sensitivity value of 0.2874 mu A/mu M and a limit of detection of 5 nM. These findings showed that N-rGO/GCE has a larger linear range than previously reported electrochemical sensors for 19-NT. Additionally, it was looked into whether N-rGO/GCE could estimate the concentration of 19-NT in prepared samples taken from milk and human serum. The analytical assays using the traditional addition technique demonstrated the excellent applicability, good recoveries between 92.00% and 98.57%, and accuracy of N-rGO/GCE in detecting the concentration of 19-NT in biological fluids and food samples (relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 4.82%).																			2193-4126	2193-4134				JAN	2024	18	1					744	755		10.1007/s11694-023-02222-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-023-02222-x		OCT 2023											WOS:001091909700001

Here, we developed an electrolyte composed of a mixture of deep eutectic solvent (DES, choline chloride-urea) and water for electrochemical methods to enhance the exfoliation and oxidation processes, enabling the one-step preparation of OH-BNNSs. It was found that the obtained OH-BNNSs were an average lateral size of 625 nm and thickness of six layers. Furthermore, the OH-BNNSs and DES were added to the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) substrate to prepare composite gel polymer electrolyte (PVA/DES/OH-BNNSs GPE) for solid-state flexible supercapacitor. The OH-BNNSs can effectively shorten the ionic transport distance and enhance ion conductivity. In addition, their excellent mechanical properties can significantly prevent the electrolyte structure from collapsing during reuse. In the meantime, DES was introduced to improve ionic conductivity and broaden the operating voltage window of supercapacitor. As a result, the symmetric solid-state flexible supercapacitor consisting of activated carbon electrodes and PVA/DES/OH-BNNSs GPE appeared a wide voltage window of 2.3 V, high specific capacitance of 151.22 F g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and remained 98% capacitance after 1500 charge-discharge cycles. This study not only opened a new pathway to efficient exfoliation of insulating layered materials but also found a novel gel polymer electrolyte for solid-state flexible supercapacitors.																			0743-7463					2022 JUN 23	2022										10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c01153		JUN 2022						35737723					WOS:000818711100001

L-FABP is a cytotoxic oxidation product secreted from the proximal tubules under ischemic and oxidative stress conditions. First, L-FABP gene expression in the kidney and liver was evaluated. Next, the urinary L-FABP concentrations in dogs with or without renal diseases were measured using a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Urinary L-FABP was normalized relative to urinary creatinine (uCre) concentrations (mu g/g uCre). Finally, the relationships between urinary L-FABP and renal biomarkers used in canine medicine or serum alanine transaminase (ALT) as an indicator of liver damage were examined. Serum and urine samples from 94 client-owned dogs including 23 dogs with renal diseases and 71 dogs without renal diseases were used for analysis. Relative L-FABP gene expression was confirmed both in the liver and kidney. Dogs with renal diseases had a significantly higher urinary L-FABP than those without, and its predictive cutoff value was 26 mu g/g uCre. Urinary L-FABP was significantly correlated with serum creatinine (r=0.4674, P<0.01), urea nitrogen (r=0.4907, P<0.01), urine specific gravity (r=-0.5100, P<0.01), and urine protein/creatinine ratio (r=0.7216, P<0.01), but not with serum ALT. Hence, dogs with a high urinary L-FABP value were more likely to have renal diseases.

Material and methods: Adult male SD rats were randomly divided into a control group, a ARF group, and a DHA treatment group with high (group H), moderate (group M), and low (group L) dosage. We detected the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) in blood. The levels of superoxide dismatase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), myeloperoxidase (MPO) interleukin (IL)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 and malondialdehyde (MDA) in kidney tissue were also determined. Meanwhile, Histopathological assay was studied. Western Blot was used to detect the protein expression of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, Histon and I kappa B alpha. Results: Renal function improved by DHA treatment which also caused marked improvement of histopathological damages. In addition, the oxidation-reduction potential and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were markedly reduced with DHA treatment, whereas endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities were significantly increased. DHA also decreased the myeloperoxidase levels and influence the release of inflammatory mediators in the renal tissues of rats with ARF. The regulatory effects of DHA was inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation. Conclusions: DHA can attenuate glycerol-induced ARF through reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of inflammation, which may be mediated by regulation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathways.

The introduced O atoms were preferable to synchronously substitute for two sp2-hybridized N atoms in the para-positions (i.e., N1' and N4' sites) of the melem unit by forming dual-O-doped g-C3N4. Together with porous structures, OPCN exhibited enlarged specific surface area, narrowed band gap and expanded visible light response. The photocatalytic activity of the optimal OPCN was approximately 9 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 for bisphenol A (BPA) removal under visible light irradiation, and efficient removal rates for various chlorophenols, phenols and dyes were also observed. Combined with experiments and DFT calculations, this dual-O-doped structure resulted in effective charge transfer and separation of OPCN under visible light irradiation by forming e(-) and h(+) -related conjugated delocalized systems on the surface, which contributed to its interfacial contact with organic pollutants and adsorbed O-2. As a result, the degradation of BPA was readily induced by photoinduced h(+) and then thoroughly mineralized by O-2(center dot-). On the other hand, more O2(center dot-) radicals were generated, which could also oxidize BPA directly due to their strong oxidation power. The superior stability and reusability of OPCN catalysts were also revealed during photoreaction. This work provides a novel viewpoint to fabricate high-performance nonmetal photocatalysts for wastewater treatment.

ZMO was synthesized using a coprecipitation technique, and NH2-BN was prepared by a urea-assisted ultrasonication/stirring method. The nanocomposite of ZMO NPs/NH2-BN was prepared using the sonication method. The crystallinity, oxidation states, and functionality of the catalysts were investigated using physiochemical characterization techniques: powder X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy. In addition, the surface morphology and topology of the ZMO NPs/NH2-BN composite were analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The ZMO NPs/NH2-BN/glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibited a well-resolved MTO reduction peak in cyclic voltammetry experiments due to the synergetic effect between the aggregated ZMO NPs and NH2-BN. In addition, ZMO NPs/NH2-BN/GCE exhibited a low limit of detection of 1.5 nM, high sensitivity (1.791 & mu;A & mu;M-1 cm-2), and broad linear ranges (0.01-12.51 & mu;M and 18.51-1777.51 & mu;M). A ZMO NPs/NH2-BN/ GCE sensor prototype was used to effectively detect MTO in environmental water samples with good recovery.					chen, shen-ming/F-1633-2014														0957-5820	1744-3598				AUG	2023	176						292	303		10.1016/j.psep.2023.06.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2023.06.008		JUN 2023											WOS:001025023500001

Phytochemicals with known pharmaceutical properties have gained interest in the field of alleviating secondary complications of diseases. Such a substance is crocin, a basic constituent of saffron (Crocus sativus). The present study aimed at examining the beneficial effects of per os crocin administration on the antioxidant status, blood biochemical profile, hepatic gene expression and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity (PAI-1) in the liver, kidney and plasma (an important marker of pre-diabetic status and major factor of thrombosis in diabetes) of healthy rats, as well as of rats with nicotinamide-streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Results Diabetes disrupted the oxidation-antioxidation balance, while crocin improved the antioxidant state in the liver by significantly affecting SOD1 gene expression and/or by restoring SOD and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels. In the kidney, crocin improved hydrogen peroxide decomposing activity and TAC. In blood, hepatic transaminases ALT and AST decreased significantly, while there was a trend of decrease regarding blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The expression of PAI-1 gene was affected in the liver by the dose of 50 mg kg(-1). Conclusions Crocin treatment contributed in restoring some parameters after diabetes induction, primarily by affecting significantly hepatic transaminases ALT and AST, SOD1 and PAI-1 gene expression and nephric H2O2 decomposing activity. In conclusion, crocin did contribute to the alleviation of some complications of diabetes.

Schottky heterojunction is considered as a potential material to realize efficient photoelectrocatalytic alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production, but its performance is limited by the built-in electric field (BIEF). Therefore, in this paper, we enhance the BIEF by doping trace amounts of Mn into Fe Urea/NF and optimize the energy band positions to reduce the forbidden bandwidths to obtain excellent photoelectrocatalytic performance. During oxygen evolution reaction (OER) only 270 mV overpotential was required to reach 100 mA cm-2 under light. Negligible overpotential changes were observed in the long-term stability test of close to 100 h under different conditions. The excellent performance of the catalysts was mainly attributed to the enhancement of BIEF, which implies that the incorporation of trace Mn accelerated the electron transport in the d-p-pi triple-orbital conjugated system and optimized the density of the electronic states in the active center, thus improving the oxidation state of the active iron. In addition, the incorporation of trace Mn effectively improves the positions of the valence and conduction bands, which in turn reduces the forbidden band width and improves the light absorption capacity. The choice of valence element Mn doping in this work provides a strong reference for designing strong BIEF heterojunction catalysts for efficient OER.

However, it remains a challenge to overcome voltage hysteresis and short cycle life in the sulfur/Al2S3 conversion reaction, which hinders the development of ASBs. Here, we studied a high-voltage ASB system based on sulfur oxidation in an AlCl3/urea electrolyte. Nitrogen-doped hollow nanocages (HNCs) synthesized from MOF precursors were rationally designed as sulfur/carbon composite electrodes (S@HNC), and the impact of the nitrogen species on the electrochemical performance of sulfur electrodes was systematically investigated. The S@HNC-900 achieved efficient conversion at 1.9 V, delivering a stable capacity of 197.3 mA h g-1 and a Coulombic efficiency of 93.28% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, the S@HNC-900 electrode exhibited exceptional rate capacity and 800th long-term cycling stability, retaining a capacity of 87.1 mA h g-1 at 500 mA g-1. Ex situ XPS and XRD characterizations elucidated the redox mechanism, revealing a four-electron transfer process (S/AlSCl7) at the S@HNC-900 electrode. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that pyridinic nitrogen-enriched HNC-900 significantly enhanced the sulfur conversion reaction and facilitated the adsorption of sulfur intermediates (SCl3 +) on the carbon interface. This work provides critical insights into the high-voltage sulfur redox mechanism and establishes a foundation for the rational design of carbon-based electrocatalysts for the enhancement of ASB performance.					lv, Guocheng/B-6813-2015	Liao, Libing/0000-0001-5312-8487; Wang, Longfei/0000-0002-3951-0783													1936-0851	1936-086X				OCT 30	2024	18	45					31559	31568		10.1021/acsnano.4c13092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c13092		OCT 2024						39475559					WOS:001346772400001

In this study, 37 different dominant chemical constituents of TLYS were identified. Rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) were used as animal models, and TLYS decoction was administered orally for 14 days. TLYS decoction reduced the levels of renal function indicators, serum creatinine levels and blood urea nitrogen levels and alleviated renal pathological changes. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses of RNA sequencing data showed that TLYS decoction had significant effects on biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions in UUO rats and that the phagosome (a membrane source in the early stages of autophagy), lysosome (an important component of autolysosome), and oxidation pathways (which contribute to mitochondrial function) might be related to the antifibrotic effects of TLYS decoction. Moreover, we found significant mitochondrial function impairment, including a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and an imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics, excessive oxidative stress, and activation of Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in UUO rats. Treatment with TLYS decoction significantly increased the MMP, normalized mitochondrial dynamics and ameliorated renal injury. Moreover, TLYS alleviated the mitophagy clearance deficiency. In conclusion, our study showed that TLYS decoction can ameliorate mitochondrial dynamics by reducing oxidative stress and regulating mitophagy, thereby relieving renal injury, protecting renal function, and reducing renal fibrosis. This study provides support for the application of and further research on TLYS decoction.

The present study was conducted to elucidate its potential protective role against maneb-induced nephrotoxicity. For this purpose, animals were randomly divided into four groups of six each. Mice of group I (negative controls) have received daily 0.5 ml of distilled water, a solvent of maneb. Mice of group II (MB) have received 30 mg/kg bw of maneb daily by intraperitoneal way. Mice of group III (MB + Zn) have received the same dose of maneb as group II, along with ZnSO4 (30 mg/kg bw) daily. Mice of group IV (Zn), considered as positive controls, have received the same dose of ZnSO4 as group III daily. Our results revealed that ZnSO4 co-administration to maneb-treated mice decreased kidney levels of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, protein carbonyls, and advanced oxidation protein products; the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants like vitamin C, glutathione, and metallothionein. It recovered the alteration of antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) and attenuated DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, this essential trace element was also able to alleviate kidney biomarkers' alterations by lowering plasma levels of creatinine, urea, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase. In addition, the histopathological changes induced by maneb were improved following zinc administration. Our results indicated that zinc might be beneficial against maneb-induced renal oxidative damage in mice.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2020	27	8					8091	8102		10.1007/s11356-019-07175-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07175-7		JAN 2020						31897980					WOS:000505352200003

Currently, natural products have built a well-recognized role in the management of many diseases induced by pollutants. As potent natural sources of bioactive compounds, marine algae have been demonstrated to be rich in novel secondary metabolites with a broad range of biological functions. In this study, adults male mice were orally treated for 15 days with KBrO3 (0.5 g/L) associated or not with extract of Alsidium corallinum, a red Mediterranean alga. In vitro study demonstrated that algal extract has antioxidant efficacy attributable to the presence of flavonoids and polyphenols. Among these, Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed A. corallinum is rich in kaempferol, apigenin, catechin, and quercetin flavonoids. In vivo study showed that supplementation with the alga significantly prevented KBrO3-induced nephrotoxicity as indicated by plasma biomarkers (urea, uric acid, and creatinin levels) and oxidative stress related parameters (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, protein oxidation products) in kidney tissue. The corrective effect of A. corallinum on KBrO3-induced kidney injury was also supported by molecular and histopathological observations. In conclusion, it was established that the red alga, thanks to its bioactive compounds, effectively counteracts toxic effects of KBrO3 and could be a useful coadjuvant agent for treatment of this pollutant poisonings.

Herein, an intimate g-C3N4 nanosheet/NiS cocatalyst heterojunction is fabricated by in situ one-step calcination of urea, thiourea and nickel acetate. Interestingly, thiourea could act as both the precursor of g-C3N4 and the sulfur source of NiS. The H-2-evolution activity of as-obtained photocatalysts was tested in a triethanolamine (TEOA) scavenger solution under visible light irradiation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping analysis clearly demonstrated that the NiS catalyst nanoparticles could be in situ fabricated and homogeneously distributed on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets without an obvious aggregation. The maximum H-2-production rate of 29.68 mu mol h(-1) could be achieved, which is nearly comparable to that of 0.5 wt% Pt loaded sample. It is believed that the intimate heterojunction interfaces between NiS nanoparticles and g-C3N4 nanosheets could be in situ constructed by high temperature calcination, which achieved the improved charge separation, the enhanced oxidation ability of TEOA and the accelerated the sluggish H-2-evolution kinetics, thus resulting in the remarkably enhanced hydrogen evolution. Therefore, our study provides insights into constructing high-quality robust g-C3N4-based heterojunction material for photocatalytic applications by using a simple one-step in-situ calcination technique.

Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) has a serious impact on the quality of patients' lives and limits the effect of radiotherapy on chest tumors. In clinical practice, effective drug intervention for RILI remains to be fully elucidated. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the biological characteristics is essential to reveal the mechanisms underlying the complex biological processes and discover novel therapeutic targets in RILI. In this study, Wistar rats received 0, 10, 20 or 35 Gy whole-thorax irradiation (WTI). Lung and plasma samples were collected within 5 days post-irradiation. Then, these samples were processed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A panel of potential plasma metabolic markers was selected by correlation analysis between the lung tissue and plasma metabolic features, followed by the evaluation of radiation injury levels within 5 days following whole-thorax irradiation (WTI). In addition, the multiple metabolic dysregulations primarily involved amino acids, bile acids and lipid and fatty acid beta-oxidation-related metabolites, implying disturbances in the urea cycle, intestinal flora metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. In particular, the accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines (ACs) was observed as early as 2 d post-WTI by dynamic plasma metabolic data analysis. Our findings indicate that plasma metabolic markers have the potential for RILI assessment. These results reveal metabolic characteristics following WTI and provide new insights into therapeutic interventions for RILI.																				2218-1989				SEP	2023	13	9							1020	10.3390/metabo13091020	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo13091020								37755300					WOS:001078745100001

Humans are usually exposed to PCP through air, contaminated water and food. PCP enters the body and adversely affects liver, gastrointestinal tract, kidney and lungs. PCP is a highly toxic class 2B or probable human carcinogen that produces large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells. This work aimed to determine PCP-induced oxidative damage in rat kidney. Adult rats were given PCP (25, 50, 100, 150 mg/kg body weight), in corn oil, once a day for 5 days while control rats were given similar amount of corn oil by oral gavage. PCP increased hydrogen peroxide level and oxidation of thiols, proteins and lipids. The antioxidant status of kidney cells was compromised in PCP treated rats while enzymes of brush border membrane (BBM) and carbohydrate metabolism were inhibited. Plasma level of creatinine and urea was also increased. Administration of PCP increased DNA fragmentation, cross-linking of DNA to proteins and DNA strand scission in kidney. Histological studies supported biochemical findings and showed significant damage in the kidneys of PCP-treated rats. These changes could be due to redox imbalance or direct chemical modification by PCP or its metabolites. These results signify that PCP-induced oxidative stress causes nephrotoxicity, dysfunction of BBM enzymes and DNA damage.

Preparation technology was optimized on a laboratory scale and the samples were characterized by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Antioxidation activity of cysteine and cystine was studied in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrix employing the non -isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the data treatment, the Berthelot-Hood equation was chosen as the temperature function. The kinetic parameters enabled the assessment of the induction period of oxidation for application temperatures. For the comparison of the stabilizing effect, the protection factors and antioxidant efficiency were calculated. The results show that the antioxidant activity of the samples depends on the preparation procedure, purity, etc. Protection factors decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing concentration. In the second part of the study, cysteine was tested in its reduced and oxidized form for the model polycondensation system of the urea -formaldehyde formulations. The quality parameters of these adhesive mixtures were verified on wood-based panels to determine formaldehyde emission and physical and mechanical properties. The results showed ca. 44% decrease of formaldehyde emission and increase of the shear strength of glued joint for all modifications in comparison with the reference sample.

J	Zhu, Y; Ling, YL; Wang, XA				Zhu, Yu; Ling, Yuanliang; Wang, Xiao'ai			Alantolactone mitigates renal injury induced by diabetes via inhibition of high glucose-mediated inflammatory response and macrophage infiltration	IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY AND IMMUNOTOXICOLOGY												Background: Inflammatory response plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Drugs that carry anti-inflammatory effects have the potential to treat diabetic nephropathy. It's reported that alantolactone (ALA), a natural product, has a variety of pharmacological effects against inflammation and oxidation. However, the specific effects of alantolactone on DN and the mechanisms underlying alantolactone remain elusive. Therefore, the present study aimed to probe whether ALA could mitigate inflammation as mediated by high glucose (HG) in NRK-52E cells and reduce renal injury caused by diabetic nephropathy. Materials and methods: The anti-inflammatory effect of ALA was evaluated in the present study using ELISA and RT-qPCR. Western blot and macrophage adhesion assay were then performed to confirm anti-macrophage adhesion and the protein expression of cell adhesion molecules. Finally, the effect of ALA and its underlying mechanism was evaluated in vivo. Results: Results showed that ALA curbed HG-stimulated expression of macrophage adhesion and pro-inflammatory cytokines in renal NRK-52E cells. In addition, both pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kappa B witnessed reduced expression or activity in oral administration with ALA in vivo, thus inhibiting the increase of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. This in consequence ameliorated fibrosis and stemmed pathological worsening of diabetic renal tissues. Conclusions: These findings suggest that ALA may hold promise in the treatment of DN, and importantly, the anti-inflammatory system may prove to be a new strategy to treat human DN.

Herein, we report the one-step solid-state synthesis of NbFeO4 nanoparticles, which were used to prepare an electrochemical transistor for the highly selective, nanomolar detection of folic acid (FA) in human blood serum samples. Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns revealed the combination of monoclinic and orthorhombic phase formations with NbO6 octahedral sites. The NbFeO4-based electrochemical transistor (ECT) exhibits an excellent sensitivity of 0.009 nM cm(-2) in the linear range of 1-100 nM as well as a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.66 nM at an applied potential of 0.6 V. In addition, this sensor shows high selectivity towards FA in the presence of interfering species such as glucose (GS), ascorbic acid (AA), urea and uric acid (UA). The outstanding performance of the sensor can be ascribed to the presence of NbO6 octahedral sites in the NbFeO4 structure which interact with folate (the oxidized form of FA) through Nb4+/Nb5+ niobium states, resulting in an increase in the oxidation peak current. This novel inorganic electrochemical transistor platform can be used to develop high performance, non-enzymatic electrochemical transistors for a wide range of bioanalytical applications.

There is a paucity of sensitive biomarkers to detect AKI, early CKD, and ameliorate extra-renal complications. Klotho protein, detected mainly in the kidneys, regulates renal health and functions as a co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) signaling. It is now coming to be known for its extreme pleiotropic actions. These include cytoprotection via anti-oxidation, anti-senescence, anti-apoptosis, renoprotective effects, promotion of angiogenesis and vascularisation, inhibition of fibrogenesis, and stem cell preservation. Emerging clinical studies suggest kidney damage to be a perpetual state of renal Klotho deficiency. In AKI, Klotho levels in plasma and/or urine possibly will serve as an initial biomarker for kidney parenchymal injury. In CKD, Klotho levels may also be an indicator of early disease as well as predict the rate of progression. Earlier studies using ELISA as a technique reveal a correlation between plasma Klotho, eGFR, serum creatine, and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) levels. Thereby preventing the decline of Klotho levels by various mechanisms can retard CKD advancement and improve renal function. Substantial data indicate Klotho can be therapeutically included as an individualized regimen for managing CKD patients. Considerable research is required in investigating the role of soluble Klotho as a biomarker in patients with different types and severity of kidney diseases, which will be highlighted in our review.

Seeds Extract on Chronic Ischemic Renal Injury in Renovascular Hypertensive Rats	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL FOOD												Previously, we have demonstrated that the seeds of Euterpe oleracia Mart. (acai) are rich in polyphenols with antihypertensive and antioxidant properties. This study evaluated the renal protective effects of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from the seeds of acai (ASE) fruits in two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) renovascular hypertension. Young male Wistar rats were used to obtain 2K1C and sham groups. Animals received ASE (200 mg/(kg.day) in drinking water) or vehicle for 40 days. We evaluated serum and urinary parameters, renal structural changes, and oxidative status. The increase in systolic blood pressure of the 2K1C group was accompanied by a decrease in left kidney volume and number of glomeruli, as well as an increase in glomerular volume and collagen deposition. ASE prevented the alterations of these parameters, except the reduced kidney volume. Serum levels of urea and creatinine and urinary protein excretion were increased in the 2K1C group and treatment with ASE improved all these functional parameters. The increased oxidative damage in the 2K1C group, assessed by lipid and protein oxidation, was prevented by ASE. The nitrite content and both expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase-1, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) were lower in the 2K1C group and restored by ASE. ASE substantially reduced renal injury and prevented renal dysfunction in 2K1C rats probably through its antihypertensive and antioxidant effects, providing a natural resource for treatment and prevention of renovascular hypertension-related abnormalities.

NHC-heterocycle carbene gold catalyst intercalated in Layered Double Hydroxides as reusable hybrid catalyst in acidic medium	APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE												NHC-heterocyclic carbene metal complexes are efficient catalysts used for the oxidation, amination, cycload-dition or hydration of alkynes. Immobilization of such complex is a strategy to avoid its decomposition/deac-tivation and allow its recycling. One limitation of the immobilization of carbene metal complexes is the acidic pH required to perform the catalysis of hydration of alkynes. The support used must be resistant in such conditions. Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH) is a widely used material as catalyst support due to their tunable chemical composition and flexible open structure. However, the LDH phases usually found as catalyst support in the literature are chemically instable under severe conditions. In particular, when operating in extreme acidic pH. This study describes the development of a pH-resistant support by screening of LDH with various composition and formulation in order to obtain a stable material at pH down to 3.0, conditions required for a model reaction, the hydration of propargyl alcohol. Then, the intercalation of a NHC-heterocyclic carbene gold anionic complex (NHC-Au) was optimized and fully characterized. The newly heterogeneous catalysts were evaluated for the targeted hydration catalysis reaction. The selected support, a LiAl2 phase obtained by urea method and dried at 80 degrees C, allowed to immobilized up to 75% of the gold complex. The intercalated catalyst was finally used for the hydration of several alkynes with yields between 84% and 100% and was recycled up to 12 cycles without any activity loss.

On the present, the main studies are building stable G-quadruplexes to form ionogels and improving the performance of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Here, the uncommon G-quadruplexes promoted by deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were established and used for chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) platform. The DES containing choline chloride and urea not only provided solvent environment for guanosine but also facilitated the formulation of the aggregates. The ion-dipole interaction among the cation of choline chloride and guanosine gave rise to the G-quartets and the hydrogen bond networks in DES or 7C-7C interaction maintained the stacking G-quartets being G-quadruplexes. Being bound to the hemin endowed G-quadruplexes peroxidase-like properties, which catalyzed the oxidation of luminol and generated expected chemiluminescence. Subsequently, attaching the luminol and fluorescent dyes to the peroxidase-like G-quadruplex/hemin complexes guaranteed the proximity requirements of CRET donor and acceptor. The CRET eutectogels could flash evident blue, chartreuse or cerise light once they were immersed into H2O2 solution, which endowed the eutectogels ability in grouping displaying objects. This work demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneously fixing the donor and acceptor of energy transfer on G-quadruplexes to develop the CRET platform, taking the luminol and dyes as example. And the instant luminescence property expanded the application of eutectogels in pattern visualization field.																			0927-7757	1873-4359				DEC 20	2022	655								130319	10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.130319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.130319		OCT 2022											WOS:000869806900005
J	Karahrudi, NZ; Taherpour, A				Karahrudi, Nargese Zolfaghar; Taherpour, Avat (Arman)			Theoretical Study of Electron Transfer Process Between Fullerenes and Membrane Cells of Helicobacter pylori	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE												The difference of the electrical potential across the membrane of Helicobacter pylori has applied to investigate the electron transfer between the membrane cells of Helicobacter pylori bacteria and the selected fullerenes C-n. The various empty carbon fullerenes as a family of carbon allotropes have been obtained and investigated. Topological descriptors were utilized to make an effective theoretical method to establish the relationship between the structural indices and the physicochemical, medicinal and biochemical properties of materials. The relationship between the Delta G(et) (free energies of electron transfer) and the "n" descriptor (as the number of carbon atoms in fullerenes) were assessed using the Rehm-Weller formula for the ET-process between the membrane cells of Helicobacter pylori and the selected fullerenes. The oxidation potential (E-Ox.) of the fullerenes C-n were applied here. The results have applied to determine the Delta G(et) (the free-energies of electron transfer) of the ET process of C-n molecules and the membrane cells of Helicobacter pylori. The free activation energies of electron transfer and the maximum wave length of the electron transfers (Delta G(et(n))(#) and lambda(et), respectively), have determined for the experimental conditions in accordance with the Marcus theory. The Hammett type relationship was investigated between "Delta Delta G(et)(#)" and "Delta Delta G(et)" of the first free energies of the ET between the H. pylori bacteria in presence of urea (different pH) and the selected fullerenes.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of melatonin on antioxidant, hepatic, and renal factors in intact and castrated dogs. Twenty male mixed-breed adult dogs were aligned in an experimental randomized and controlled trial. The dogs were randomly divided into four equal groups: melatonin, castrated, castrated and melatonin, and control. They were treated with melatonin (0.3 mg/Kg, once daily, orally) immediately after the castration for 1 month and their blood samples were collected weekly from 2 days after treatment with melatonin. Results Treating castrated dogs with melatonin increased the level of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase compared with that of the control and castrated groups. The malondialdehyde level increased significantly following castration. Melatonin treatment decreased malondialdehyde concentration in the castrated dogs. Castration increased the level of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase significantly in comparison with that of the control group. Treating the castrated dogs with melatonin decreased significantly liver enzymes compared with those of the castrated dogs. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels increased in the castrated dogs in comparison with that of the control group. Conclusions The administration of melatonin in castrated dogs increased antioxidant activity and decreased oxidation products, compared with those of the castrated and untreated dogs, without adverse effects on liver enzymes and kidney function.

A targeted metabolomics assay for cardiac metabolism and demonstration using a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy	METABOLOMICS												Metabolomics can be performed either as an 'open profiling' tool where the aimis to measure, usually in a semi-quantitative manner, as many metabolites as possible or perform 'closed' or 'targeted' analyses where instead a pre-defined set of metabolites are measured. Targeted methods can be designed to be more sensitive and quantitative and so are particularly appropriate to systems biology for quantitative models of systems or when metabolomics is performed in a hypothesis driven manner to test whether a particular pathway is perturbed. We describe a targeted metabolomics assay that quantifies a broad range of over 130 metabolites relevant to cardiac metabolism including the pathways of the citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, amino acid metabolism, the urea cycle, nucleotides and reactive oxygen species using tandem mass spectrometry to produce quantitative, sensitive and robust data. This assay is illustrated by profiling cardiac metabolism in a lamin A/C (Lmna) mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The model of DCM was characterised by increases in concentrations of proline and methyl-histidine suggestive of increased myofibrillar and collagen degradation, as well as decreases in a number of citric acid cycle intermediates and carnitine derivatives indicating reduced energy metabolism in the dilated heart. These assays could be used for any other cardiac or cardiovascular disease in that they cover central core metabolism and key pathways involved in cardiac metabolism, and may provide a general start for many mammalian systems.

The morphology and structure of the RGO/P-L-GSH modified GCE were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FT-IR spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As an electrochemical sensor, the RGO/P-L-GSH modified GCE composite exhibited strong catalytic activity toward the oxidation of 4-AP which was demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry. Furthermore, the electrochemical sensor exhibited an excellent current response for 4-AP over a wide linear range of 0.4 mu M to 200 mu M (R-2 = 0.9934) with a lower detection limit (LOD) of 0.03 mu M (S/N = 3), as well as a sensitivity of 27.2 (mu A mu M-1 cm(-2)) and excellent selectivity, reproducibility and stability. The electrochemical sensor provides good anti-interference ability in the presence of glucose, fructose, paracetamol, ethanol, L-isoleucine, L-histidine, L-cysteine, dopamine, L-serine, L-tyrosine, phenylalanine, urea, hydrogen peroxide, K+, Ca2+, Na+, F-, Cu2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, SO42-, SO32-, Cl-, folic acid and ascorbic acid.

We propose a novel approach by designing a hierarchical structure of cobalt phosphide (CoP) and nickel phosphide (Ni8P3) nanoparticles topotactically developed on nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) nanorods (CoNiP/NiS) via a sulfuration-phosphorization strategy using conductive 3D nickel foam. Hierarchical heterostructured nanorods were achieved without the need for template removal steps or the assistance of surfactants. This not only simplifies the process but also improves the exposure of active sites for catalytic purposes. Furthermore, the theoretical calculation results revealed that the high H* adsorption-free energy for CoP and Ni8P3 phases significantly decreases upon coupling with Ni3S2, which indicates that the interfacial electronic interaction synergistically modulates both CoP and Ni8P3 (CoNiP) at the coupled interfaces and facilitates the adsorption and desorption of H* intermediates during the HER process. The resulting electrode exhibits excellent performance in the HER catalytic process and shows great performance for further exploration in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Our work provides a stepping stone toward rational topotactic transformation of active materials on porous substrates, using electronic structure regulation and heterointerfaces to produce promising electrocatalysts for sustainable, large-scale hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Using conductive substrates (NF) as Ni sources, Ni3S2 nanorods are coated with CoP and Ni8P3 nanoparticles, offering abundant active sites, electronic modulation interfaces, and insights into catalytically active sites for H2 evolution reaction.

Therefore, development of rapid and accurate POCT (point -of -care testing) methods for cholesterol detection is crucial for assessing food quality and early diagnosis of diseases, in particular, in a resource -limited environment. In this study, a smartphone-assisted colorimetric biosensor is constructed based on platinum,phosphorus-codoped carbon nitride (PtCNP2) for the rapid detection of cholesterol. Phosphorusdoped carbon nitride is prepared by thermal annealing of urea and NH4PF6, into which platinum is atomically dispersed by thermal refluxing. The obtained PtCNP2 exhibits an excellent peroxidase-like activity under physiological pH, whereby colorless o-phenylenediamine (OPD) is oxidized to colored 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can be produced during the oxidation of cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase. A smartphone-assisted visual sensing system is then constructed based on the color recognition software, and rapid on -site detection of cholesterol is achieved by reading the RGB values. Meanwhile, the generated DAP shows an apparent fluorescence signal and can realize highly sensitive detection of cholesterol by the change of the fluorescence signal intensity. Such a cholesterol sensor exhibits a wide linear detection range of 0.5-600 mu g mL-1 and a low detection limit of 59 ng mL-1. The practicality of the sensor is successfully demonstrated in the rapid detection of cholesterol in serum and food.

The sensing of nitrite is done on Cobalt (II) tetra methyl-quinoline oxy bridged phthalocyanine modified glassy carbon electrode (CoTM-QOPc/GCE) in linear range of (CV 0.3-120, CA 0.2-170 mu molL(-1)), lower detection limit of (CV 0.1, CA 0.06 mu molL(-1)) and sensitivity of (CV 0.765, CA 1.204 mu A mu M(-1)cm(-2)). For better voltammetric study CoTM-QOPc was mixed with carbon nano particles (CNP) which increase the surface area of glassy carbon electrode, therefore sensing of nitrite has studied on CoTM-QOPc/CNP/GCE in linear range of (CV 0.2-200, DPV 0.2-225, CA 0.1-350 mu molL(-1)), lower detection limit of (CV 0.06, DPV 0.06, CA 0.033 mu molL(-1)) and sensitivity of (CV 2.298, DPV 1.031, CA 1.237 mu A mu M(-1)cm(-2)).

In the present work, the methanation of CO was performed in a slurry-bed reactor with a series of nanosized Ni-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by microwave assisted solution combustion with different fuels (urea, glycine, ethylene glycol and citric acid). As compared with other fuels, a majority of urea and nitrates simultaneously decompose and occur in extensive overlapped temperature ranges during heating, which is conducive to the formation of a moderate and sustained combustion reaction. In addition, the thermodynamic calculation and thermogravimetric analysis indicate that the amount of heat generated during combustion is the minimum when urea was used as fuel. By the formation of a stable combustion and a relative low combustion temperature, the NiAl-U catalyst exhibits the largest BET area and metal surface area, the smallest Ni particle size and more dispersive Ni species, as evidenced by XRD, TEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption, H-2-TPR and H-2 pulse chemisorption characterizations. In the slurry methanation of CO, the conversion of CO and selectivity for CH4 over NiAl-U catalyst reach up to 95.7% and 96.2% at 300 degrees C, 1.0 MPa and 3000 mL/g(cat) h, respectively, which are superior to those of other combustion-synthesized catalysts and commercial catalyst. In addition, The NiAl-U catalyst exhibits significant improvement in anti-sintering during 200 h lifetime test, mainly because of smaller Ni particle size, high dispersity of Ni active species on support and high stability of support. The findings presented here are expected to provide new approaches for rational design of nanosized Ni-Al2O3 catalysts for CO methanation reactions in slurry phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, we compared the effects of similarly structured lipids on postprandial lipid metabolism and obesity protection. The results revealed that the novel structured lipid synthesized using the enzymatic method not only exhibited better physical properties than traditional oils but also had high oxidation stability and crystallization degree. In terms of physiological function, the low-dose 1,3C-2D-TAG group exhibited higher cholesterol and triglyceride levels, lower kidney weight or body weight, and higher serum aspartate aminotransferase and blood urea nitrogen levels than control group, whereas the high-dose 1,3C-2D-TAG group exhibited higher triglyceride levels. Moreover, the medium-dose 1,3C-2D-TAG group had remarkably higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than the high-lipid, control, and 1,2,3C-TAG groups; however, the cholesterol and triglyceride levels and kidney and liver functions did not differ significantly among these groups. The study results suggest that 1,3C-2D-TAG can not only facilitate the effective utilization of the energy supplied by medium-chain fatty acids but also help overcome difficulties in the absorption of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.					wang, zhongming/N-6863-2019; Wang, Qiang/AAV-7131-2021	, Qiang Wang/0000-0001-6281-0699													2048-7177					AUG	2023	11	8					4516	4529		10.1002/fsn3.3410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.3410		MAY 2023						37576038					WOS:000986527500001

However, it has the drawbacks of low detection range and difficulty in manufacture. In this work, a hybrid heterogeneous nanocomposite of copper and nickel phosphide (Ni2P-Cu3P) has been designed and successfully prepared by a mild one-step solvothermal method. Inspired by the porous characteristic of sponges, the mesoporous structure with a much larger surface area has been constructed by adjusting the reaction conditions and the element composition of copper and nickel to have more active sites, thus broadening linear range. The precisely designed heterogeneous nanostructure and the unique mesoporous morphology of Ni2P-Cu3P were confirmed and characterized by the XRD and TEM analysis. Electrochemical oxidation of glucose on the composite modified glassy-carbon electrode (Ni2P-Cu3P/GCE) was measured by chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry. At the optimal test potential of + 0.64 V, the Ni2PCu3P/GCE hybrid electrode possessed an ultra-high sensitive response of 4700 mu A mM-1 cm-2 to glucose, in a broad linear range from 4 mu M to 5 mM, and a low detection limit of 0.1 mu M at an S/N ratio of 3. The electrode also exhibits excellent anti-interference properties towards other common co-existing electroactive distractions, such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, urea, dopamine, etc.						He, Li/0000-0001-7099-3923; Li, Jiawei/0009-0000-7335-1766													0169-4332	1873-5584				AUG 15	2022	593								153395	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153395		APR 2022											WOS:000796443900002

In particular, colorimetric biosensors can be combined with color recognition applications on smartphones for the detection of analytes, rendering the whole procedure more applicable in everyday life. Herein, chitosan (CS) films were prepared with the deep eutectic solvent (DES) choline chloride/urea/glycerol (ChCl:U:Gly). Glucose oxidase (GOx), a widely utilized enzyme in quality control, was immobilized within CS films through glutaraldehyde (GA), leading to the formation of CS/GOx films. The optimized GOx concentration and DES content were determined for the films. Moreover, the effect of the pH and temperature of the glucose oxidation reaction on the enzymatic activity of GOx was studied. The structure, stability, and specificity of the CS/GOx films as well as the Km values of free and immobilized GOx were also determined. Finally, the analytical performance of the films was studied by using both a spectrophotometer and a color recognition application on a smartphone. The results demonstrated that the films were highly accurate, specific to glucose, and stable when stored at 4 degrees C for 4 weeks and when reused 10 times, without evident activity loss. Furthermore, the films displayed a good linear response range (0.1-0.8 mM) and a good limit of detection (LOD, 33 mu M), thus being appropriate for the estimation of glucose concentration in real samples through a smartphone application.

Forty male albino rats were distributed into four groups. Control group is provided with distilled water. Lead acetate gimp was given lead acetate (100 mg/kg bwt) orally for 10 weeks. The third and fourth groups administered silymarin at doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg bwt, respectively, 1 h before administration of lead acetate for 10 weeks. Lead acetate altered liver structure and function that represented by significant elevation of the activities of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferases and serum levels of urea and creatinine. Hepatic and renal tissues' malondialdehyde concentrations were increased, while reduced glutathionc content and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were reduced in the lead acetate group. Also, lead acetate increased caspase-3 mRNA expression and inhibited alpha-fetoprotein mRNA expression in hepatic tissues, as well as it altered liver and kidney tissues' architectures. In contrast, silymarin ameliorated in a dose dependent mannar the toxic effects of lead acetate on the liver and kidneys through modulation of lead acetate which altered liver and kidney function and structures via reducing lipid oxidation and pathological changes of hepatic and renal tissue structure, improving antioxidant defense system of liver and kidneys, and decreasing pro-apoptotic gene expression in hepatic tissue. This study indicated that silymarin ameliorated lead acetate-induced hepatorenal toxicity via its antioxidant and cytoprotective potentials.

Gamma-Glutamyl Cysteine Attenuates Tissue Damage and Enhances Tissue Regeneration in a rat Model of Lead-Induced Nephrotoxicity	BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH												Lead is a biohazardous metal that is commonly involved in human illness including renal injury. Although it is a non-redox reactive metal, lead-induced renal injury is largely based on oxidative stress. The current work aimed at exploring the possible protective effect of gamma-glutamyl cysteine (gamma GC) against lead-induced renal injury. Rats were allocated to normal and gamma GC control groups, lead-treated group, and lead and gamma GC-treated group. gamma GC alleviated lead-induced renal injury as evidenced by attenuation of histopathological aberration, amelioration of oxidative injury as demonstrated by significant reduction in lipid and protein oxidation, elevation of total antioxidant capacity, and glutathione level. The activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was significantly elevated. gamma GC significantly decreased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 beta and the activity of the apoptotic marker caspase-3. In addition, gamma GC reduced kidney lead content, enhanced weight gain, and improved renal function as demonstrated by reduced serum levels of urea and creatinine. Importantly, gamma GC upregulated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, denoting enhanced renal regenerative capacity. Together, our findings highlight evidence for alleviating effects of gamma GC against lead-induced renal injury that is potentially mediated through diminution of oxidative tissue injury, reduction of inflammatory response, attenuation of apoptosis, and enhancement of renal regenerative capacity.

INORGANIC CHEMISTRY												Coppet chloride catalysis is a well-established field in organic and inorganic chemistry. However, in most cases a detailed mechanistic understanding of the individual reaction steps and identification of reactive intermediates are still missing. The present study reports the results of spectroscopic and spectrometric measurements that support formation of copper agglomerates during catalytic processes. The composition of CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O in several coordinating solvents and the influence of, asic coreagents such as (NaOBu)-Bu-t and K2CO3 on the structure in the solid state as well as in solution were investigated. Several experiments involving crystal structure determination, IR spectroscopy, and ultra-high-resolution cryospray-ionization mass spectrometry were performed. The crystal structures of [CuCl2(H2O)]center dot 0.5(CH3)(2)CO (1), [Cu-2(CH3CN)(2)Cl-4] (2), [Cu-3(CH3CN)(3)Cl-6] (3), [Cu3Cl6(THF)(4)] (4), [Cu(DMSO)(2)Cl-2] (5), (H2N(CH3)(2))(2)[CuCl3] (6), and [Cu4OCl6(THF)(urea)(3)]center dot 3THF center dot urea (8) are reported herein. It can be clearly demonstrated that it mu(4)-oxido copper clusters of the formula [Cu4OCl6(solvent)(4)] are the main product from the reactions of CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O and basic coreagents. As a final result of these experiments, it can be stated that mu(4)-oxido copper clusters most likely play an important role in the mechanism of copper chloride-catalyzed reactions.

Thermally Stable P-Chiral Supramolecular Phosphines, their Self-Assembly and Implication in Rh-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL												P-chiral supramolecular phosphine ligands are crucial for asymmetric transformations, but their synthesis is tedious. We report a one-step synthesis of thermally stable P-chiral supramolecular phosphines and their performance in the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. A rational designing and synthesis of (R, R)-QuinoxP* ligated palladium complex (Pd-2) in excellent yield is reported. This Pd-2 catalyzed a direct P-C coupling of 2,3-dihydro-1-H-phosphindole (A1)/1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophosphindoline (A2) with 1-(3-iodophenyl)urea (B1)/2-iodo /6-hydroxy pyridine (B2) and,produced corresponding ligands L1-L3. The P-C coupling between A1 and B2 produced 6-(2,3-dihydro-1H-phosphindol-1-yl)pyridine-2(1H)-one (L2) with an excellent enantiomeric excess of up to 99 %. L2 was found to be remarkably stable even at 150 degrees C and did not oxidize/hydrolyze for at least 24 hours in open air. Such thermal stability and an impediment to oxidation are unprecedented. L2 self-assembled and produced L2-C1 (Pt), L2-C2(Pd), and L2-C3(Rh) assemblies. The utility of the self-assembled P-chiral ligand was demonstrated in the Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of functionalized olefins. The L2-C3 catalyzed AH of functionalized alkenes and delivered chiral products with excellent enantioselectivity of >99 %. A small library of 16 substrates was subjected to AH using L2-C3 to produce chiral compounds with excellent conversion and ee.

Colorimetric Sensing of Hydrogen Peroxide Using Ionic-Liquid-Sensitized Zero-Valent Copper Nanoparticle (nZVCu)	CHEMISTRYSELECT												In this study, a stable ionic liquid (IL) mediated zero-valent copper nanoparticle (nZVCu), namely IL-nZVCu, has been evaluated for catalytic properties towards H2O2-mediated TMB (3, 3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) reaction under normal conditions of temperature and pH. The various analytical techniques like Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to confirm the structure and nano size of nZVCu. The simple protic IL 1-hydrogen-3-methylimidazolium acetate (HmimOAc) with its cation 1-methylimidazole and anion acetate was synthesized, characterized, and coated on nZVCu to prepared IL-nZVCu. As a novel mimic peroxidase, IL-nZVCu could quickly catalyze the oxidation reaction of specific chromogenic substrate TMB, when H2O2 acts as an oxidant, followed by a remarkable color change in the solution measured by UV/Vis Spectrophotometry. The enhanced catalytic activity and significant color change were greatly dependent on the catalyst dosage, the volume of IL taken, incubation time, H2O2 concentration, and TMB concentration. Also, IL-nZVCu showed no response toward ascorbic acid, cholesterol, dopamine, urea and uric acid. Based on these findings, IL-nZVCu could be effectively used for visual colorimetric sensing of H2O2 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 44 mu M over the dynamic linear range from 40 mu M to 1000 mu M concentration.

Aluminum Electrochemical Nucleation and Growth onto a Glassy Carbon Electrode from a Deep Eutectic Solvent	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY												This paper deals with the aluminum nanoparticles nucleation and growth kinetics and electrodeposition mechanism onto a glassy carbon electrode from Al(III) ions dissolved in a deep eutectic solvent based on choline chloride: urea. The cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry analyses indicate that the Al electrodeposition was attained directly from Al(III) ions that formed metallic Al, of which the nuclei provoked, in turn, residual water reduction on their growing surfaces. Consequently, hydroxide ions formed and reacted with Al(III) ions in the DES, originating thus insoluble Al(OH) 3 onto the Al nuclei surfaces. Therefore, oxidation currents were absent during the backward scan of the cyclic voltammetry due to passivation of the Al deposits with the Al(OH) 3 formed during the direct scan. Analyses of the experimental potentiostatic current density transients were carried out by means of a theoretical formalism, comprising the simultaneous presence of Al diffusion-controlled 3D nucleation and growth and residual water reaction over the Al nuclei growing surfaces. This model helps explaining clearly the contribution of the residual water during the aluminum electrodeposition and determining the charge percentages due to each individual contribution to the total process. Evidence of the aluminum, nanoparticles, deposits was obtained by means of SEM, EDX and XPS. (c) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

The current study elucidated the potential protective effect of JRVO against nephrotoxicity induced by lead. Male rats were randomly divided into three groups: group one (control) received ad libitum distilled water and 1 mL of saline solution (0.9 %) given by intra-peritoneal (i.p) injection, group two (Pb) was kept on tap distilled water and animals were i.p, injected daily with lead every two days from day five until day ten, namely the sacrifice day, and group three (Pb+J) was administered by intra-peritoneal injection of Pb with the same dose and same way with Group two, while JRVO extract was administered daily by gavage during ten days. The exposure of lead reduced the number of red and white blood cells. Besides, plasma biomarkers (urea, uric acid, creatinine, LDH and ALP) levels were reduced. Lipid and protein per-oxidations increased and objectified by high TBARS and PCOs levels, while glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities showed a significant decline after ten-day treatment. Conversely, the JRVO prevented kidney biomarker changes by improving hepatotoxicity induced by lead as evidenced by restoring the biochemical markers cited above to near normal levels. Kidney histoarchitecture confirmed the biochemical parameters and the beneficial role of JRVO. It can be concluded that the administration of JRVO alleviates Pb-induced toxicity, thus demonstrating its potent antioxidant efficacy.					elfeki, abdelfattah/LKL-6561-2024	elfeki, abdelfattah/0009-0009-9949-1367; GARGOURI, Manel/0000-0002-1803-3308													1611-2156						2018	17						492	504		10.17179/excli2018-1235	http://dx.doi.org/10.17179/excli2018-1235								30034312					WOS:000434453000004

The developed sensors show great durability for three months in storage, and high specificity performance for preclinical study using spiked UA in a synthetic urine sample. A simple route for this hybrid nanocomposite was proposed through an oxidation-reduction with reflux (ORR) process. A significant increase in the electroactive surface area of SPCE was achieved by modifying it with MWCNT/AgNP. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed this synthesis. The nanocomposite nanostructure electrodes achieved an outstanding UA detection with sensitivity of 0.1021 mu A mu M-1 and a wide dynamic range of 10-1000 mu M. In phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the measurements achieved a detection limit of 84.04 nM while in pure synthetic urine; it was 6.074 mu M.

Use of zinc oxide nanoparticles in the growing rabbit diets to mitigate hot environmental conditions for sustainable production and improved meat quality	BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH												Background This study evaluated the modulatory effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) supplementations on the productive performance, blood biochemistry, carcass criteria, and meat quality of White New Zealand rabbits reared under hot conditions. A total of 125 White New Zealand male rabbits (body weight, "650 +/- 11", 30 days old) were assigned to five treatment diets: basal diets supplemented with ZnO-NPs at 0, 20, 40, 60, or 80 mg/kg for 60 days. Each treatment was replicated 25 times with one rabbit each. Results The body weight (BW), BW gain, and feed intake linearly increased with zinc oxide nanoparticle supplements. Supplementation of ZnO-NPs at 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/kg significantly improved (linear, P < 0.05) the feed conversion ratio compared to the control group. Moreover, supplementation of ZnO-NPs at these inclusions 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/kg significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the serum cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and urea compared to control group. The lipid oxidation was lower, and the water holding capacity of rabbit meat was improved (P < 0.001) in rabbits fed on 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/kg ZnO-NPs supplemented diets compared to control. Conclusion The results suggested that dietary supplementation of ZnO-NPs (20-80 mg/kg) can mitigate the negative impacts of heat stress on rabbit performance and health. Its supplementation improved growth performance and meat physicochemical properties, and blood biochemistry parameters of White New Zealand rabbits.

Facile modifications of CBs were achieved using thermal, urea-based hydrothermal, and acid oxidation treatments. The material properties of the modified CBs, LNMO-based electrode surface, and electrolyte compositions were investigated and correlated. Based on the distribution of the decomposition deposits on the surface of the electrode, it is confirmed that CB, rather than the LNMO active material, dominates the electrolyte decomposition site at a high voltage, owing to its relatively high surface area for the reaction. Additionally, compared with the pristine CB, the hydrothermally treated N-doped CB (HCB) improves the electrochemical performance of the LNMO cathode, although the thermally treated sample exhibits the most adverse influence, followed by the oxidized one. The LNMO/HCB cathode attains optimum capacity retention (approximately 95%) for 100 cycles (1 C) and a high rate capability (70%, 5 C/0.2 C), corresponding to a lowered resistance at the cathode-electrolyte interface. Furthermore, HCB with a limited specific surface area and increased defects, as well as additional pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N groups, substantially reduces the decomposition deposits on the surface of the electrode and the decomposition products in the electrolyte. These phenomena account for the improved electrochemical performance of the LNMO/HCB cathode. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The application of deep eutectic solvent ionic liquids for environmentally-friendly dissolution and recovery of precious metals	MINERALS ENGINEERING												The processing of ore by hydrometallurgy or pyrometallurgy typically has a high energy demand, and associated release of carbon dioxide. Thus there is a need to develop more energy-efficient and environmentally-compatible processes. This article demonstrates that deep eutectic solvent (DES) ionic liquids provide one such method since they can be used to selectively dissolve and recover native gold and tellurium, sulphides and tellurides. Ionic liquids are anhydrous salts that are liquid at low temperature. They are powerful solvents and electrolytes with potential for high selectivity in both dissolution and recovery. Deep eutectic solvents are a form of ionic liquid that are mixtures of salts such as choline chloride with hydrogen-bond donors such as urea. DESs are environmentally benign, yet chemically stable and, furthermore, the components are already produced in large quantities at comparable costs to conventional reagents. Electrum, galena and chalcopyrite, as well as tellurobismuthite (Bi2Te3), were soluble in DES through an oxidative leach at 45-50 degrees C. Leaching rates determined by a novel technique employing an optical profiler were very favourable in comparison to the current industrial process of cyanidation. Pyrite was notably insoluble by an oxidative leach. However, pyrite, and indeed any other sulphide, could be selectively dissolved by electrolysis in a DES, thus suggesting a protocol whereby target inclusions could be liberated by electrolysis and then dissolved by subsequent oxidation. lonometallurgy could thus offer a new set of environmentally-benign process for metallurgy.

Since there was no published document about its Life Cycle Inventory in Iran, the aim of this study was to document the life cycle inventory data from the particleboard manufacturing in the second hand lines in Iran. The study covers the energy consumption and environmental impacts of raw materials and processes during particleboard production. In order to identify the main hotspots and characterize the production process, impact categories were considered using CML methodology and cumulative exergy dethand (CExD) indicator. The results revealed that the board shaping subsystem was the main contributor to the most of impact categories. The main hotspot for resin production was known as Urea-formaldehyde (UF). Electricity was the main hotspot in acidification (AC) and ozone layer depletion (OLD) impact categories, while transportation and production process were the main hotspots in marine aquatic ecotoxicity (ME) and photochemical oxidation (PO) impact categories, respectively. Moreover, rotary dryer, hot press, flaker and hammer mill, vacuum pump and diesel fuel were the most effective sectors in the emissions of the production process. Results for substitution of natural gas showed that, except some impact categories, the use of alternative source of thermal energy such as wood residues could improve emissions from the manufacturing process.

The physiology of nitrifiers has been intensively studied, and urea and ammonia are the only recognized energy sources that promote the aerobic growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea. Here we report the aerobic growth of a pure culture of the ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeote Nitrososphaera gargensis(1) using cyanate as the sole source of energy and reductant; to our knowledge, the first organism known to do so. Cyanate, a potentially important source of reduced nitrogen in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems(2), is converted to ammonium and carbon dioxide in Nitrososphaera gargensis by a cyanase enzyme that is induced upon addition of this compound. Within the cyanase gene family, this cyanase is a member of a distinct clade also containing cyanases of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrospira. We demonstrate by co-culture experiments that these nitrite oxidizers supply cyanase-lacking ammonia oxidizers with ammonium from cyanate, which is fully nitrified by this microbial consortium through reciprocal feeding. By screening a comprehensive set of more than 3,000 publically available metagenomes from environmental samples, we reveal that cyanase-encoding genes clustering with the cyanases of these nitrifiers are widespread in the environment. Our results demonstrate an unexpected metabolic versatility of nitri-fying microorganisms, and suggest a previously unrecognized importance of cyanate in cycling of nitrogen compounds in the environment.

Herein, we report a novel 1D carbon nanotube-modified 3D hollow carbon sphere with a hierarchical structure and strong interfacial interactions. Good surface dispersion of the bimetal seeds on the carbon sphere can achieve uniform growth of curly CNT arrays. The porous 3D carbon skeleton can provide support structures to stabilize NiFe seeds for uniform growth of the CNTs and the carbon layer; thus abundant FeNi3/(NiFe)9S8 heterostructures encapsulated inside the 1D/3D skeleton can act as spatially dispersed active sites to accelerate reaction kinetics. Moreover, the multilevel 1D/3D structure with high porosity and hydrophilicity can promote the infiltration of electrolyte into the internal structure, thus constructing an optimal gas-solid-liquid interface to enhance the electrocatalytic process. Therefore, N-HCS@NiFe can achieve an overpotential and potential of 228 mV and 1.348 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm-2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively, while the half wave potential and average electron transfer number of N-HCS@NiFe for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are 0.80 V vs. RHE and 4.0, as well as excellent long-term stability at high current density for various reactions. This work provides a new strategy for the rational 1D/3D structural design and active metal spatial dispersion of multifunctional electrocatalysts for green and sustainable energy conversion applications.

Phytosynthesis of Palladium Nanoclusters: An Efficient Nanozyme for Ultrasensitive and Selective Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species	MOLECULES												Hydrogen peroxide is a low-reactivity reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, it can easily penetrate cell membranes and produce highly reactive hydroxyl radical species through Fenton's reaction. Its presence in abnormal amounts can lead to serious diseases in humans. Although the development of a simple, ultrasensitive, and selective method for H2O2 detection is crucial, this remains a strategic challenge. The peroxidase mimetic activity of palladium nanoclusters (PdNCs) has not previously been evaluated. In this study, we developed an ultrasensitive and selective colorimetric detection method for H2O2 using PdNCs. An unprecedented eco-friendly, cost-effective, and facile biological method was developed for the synthesis of PdNCs. This is the first report of the biosynthesis of PdNCs. The synthesized nanoclusters had a significantly narrow size distribution profile and high stability. The nanoclusters were demonstrated to possess a peroxidase mimetic activity that could oxidize peroxidase substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). Various interfering substances in serum (100 mu M phenylalanine, cysteine, tryptophan, arginine, glucose, urea, Na+, Fe2+, PO43-, Mn+2, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, NH4+, and K+) were included to evaluate the selectivity of the assay, and oxidation of TMB occurred only in the presence of H2O2. Therefore, PdNCs show an efficient nanozyme for the peroxidase mimetic activity. The assay produced a sufficient signal at the ultralow concentration of 0.0625 mu M H2O2. This colorimetric assay provides a real-time, rapid, and easy-to-use platform for the detection of H2O2 for clinical purposes.

However, research on the effect of soil-derived Lysinibacillus on the intestinal microbiota spatial disparity of mice is lacking. To test the probiotic properties of Lysinibacillus and the spatial disparity on mice intestinal microorganisms, hemolysis test, molecular phylogenetic analysis, antibiotic sensitivity testing, serum biochemical assays and 16S rRNA profiling were applied. The results showed that Lysinibacillus (LZS1 and LZS2) was resistant to two common antibiotics, Tetracyclines and Rifampin, and sensitive to other antibiotics among the 12 antibiotics tested and negative for hemolysis. In addition, the body weight of group L (treatment of Lysinibacillus, 1.0 x 108 CFU/d for 21days) mice was significantly greater than that of the control group; serum biochemical tests showed that the TG and UREA were significantly lower in group L. The spatial disparity of intestinal microorganisms in mice was significant, treatment of Lysinibacillus (1.0 x 108 CFU/ d for 21days) reduced the intestinal microbial diversity and decreased the richness of Proteobacteria, Cyano-bacteria and Bacteroidetes in mice. Furthermore, Lysinibacillus treatment enhanced Lactobacillus and Lachnospir-aceae richness and significantly reduced 6 bacterial genera in jejunum community, reduced 8 bacterial genera, but increased bacteria at the 4 genera level in cecum microorganisms. In conclusion, this study demonstrated spatial disparity of intestinal microorganisms in mice and probiotic potential of Lysinibacillus isolated from soil.					chen, xinzhu/IWM-0581-2023	Zeng, Zhibo/0000-0002-2272-8823													0147-6513	1090-2414				JUN 15	2023	258								114952	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114952		MAY 2023						37141683					WOS:000999924400001

The dispersion of MWCNTs has been considered a big challenge. For this purpose, we first thermally treated MWCNTs at 1000 degrees C in air for 30 min. Then, thermally treated MWCNTs were chemically coupled with NiO nanostructures by a hydrothermal method. The material characterization in terms of structure, morphology, and composition is well studied by different analytical techniques. The NiO composite (sample 2) with highest weight of MWCNTs had a leaf-like morphology and it exhibits a cubic phase of NiO. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to study the electrochemical activity of prepared composite material towards the oxidation of uric acid in the phosphate buffer solution of pH 7.0. Sample 2 showed a well-behaved anodic peak with enhanced peak current and exhibited a linear range from 0.01 mM to 2.5 mM for uric acid with a low limit of detection 0.001mM. Sample 2 was found to be very selective under the environment of competing interferents such as urea, glucose, lactic acid and ethanol. This sample exhibits significant stability, thus it is a potential protocol for the monitoring of uric acid from real samples. This study provides a low-cost platform for the fabrication of efficient materials for various applications such as batteries, fuel cells and water splitting.

In-situ application of MICP in soils is performed either by augmenting the site with ureolytic bacteria or by stimulating indigenous ureolytic bacteria. Both of these approaches may lead to changes in the indigenous bacterial population composition and to the accumulation of large quantities of ammonium. In this batch study, effective ureolysis was stimulated in coastal sand from a semiarid environment, with low initial ureolytic bacteria abundance. Two different carbon sources were used: yeast-extract and molasses. No ureolysis was observed in their absence. Ureolysis was achieved using both carbon sources, with a higher rate in the yeast-extract enrichment resulting from increased bacterial growth. The changes to the indigenous bacterial population following biostimulation of ureolysis were significant: Bacilli class abundancy increased from 5% in the native sand up to 99% in the yeast-extract treatment. The sand was also enriched with ammonium-chloride, where ammonia-oxidation was observed after 27 days, but was not reflected in the bacterial population composition. These results suggest that biostimulation of ureolytic bacteria can be applied even in a semiarid and nutrient-poor environment using a simple carbon source, that is, molasses. The significant changes to bacterial population composition following ureolysis stimulation could result in a decrease in trophic activity and diversity in the treated site, thus they require further attention.

J	Zhang, T; Mohan, C				Zhang, Ting; Mohan, Chandra			Caution in studying and interpreting the lupus metabolome	ARTHRITIS RESEARCH & THERAPY												Several metabolomics studies have shed substantial light on the pathophysiological pathways underlying multiple diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This review takes stock of our current understanding of this field. We compare, collate, and investigate the metabolites in SLE patients and healthy volunteers, as gleaned from published metabolomics studies on SLE. In the surveyed primary reports, serum or plasma samples from SLE patients and healthy controls were assayed using mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and metabolites differentiating SLE from controls were identified. Collectively, the circulating metabolome in SLE is characterized by reduced energy substrates from glycolysis, Krebs cycle, fatty acid beta oxidation, and glucogenic and ketogenic amino acid metabolism; enhanced activity of the urea cycle; decreased long-chain fatty acids; increased medium-chain and free fatty acids; and augmented peroxidation and inflammation. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because several of the same metabolic pathways are also significantly influenced by the medications commonly used in SLE patients, common co-morbidities, and other factors including smoking and diet. In particular, whereas the metabolic alterations relating to inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione generation do not appear to be steroid-dependent, the other metabolic changes may in part be influenced by steroids.

In this study, a series of nano MnO/biochar-containing composite materials were prepared with Mn (NO3)(2), urea and pomelo peel as raw materials, via simple hydrothermal treatment and calcination, as anode materials for LIBs, where the biochar was used as inexpensive conductive medium and volume buffer. The electrochemical performance of the composite materials shows complicated correlation with the biochar contents, which associate with different carbonization temperatures. Elaborate characterizations with XRD, SEM, TEM, and Mn 2p, Mn 3s XPS spectra were conducted and jointly analyzed, which revealed that the surface of MnO nanocrystals undergoes different degrees of oxidation. The thickness of the surface amorphous Mn2O3 layer on the MnO nanocrystals influences the long-term electrochemical stability more significantly than the circumstances of biochar encapsulation, which was proved through cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. A composite material with moderate biochar content and thin layer of Mn2O3 coating on MnO nanocrystals will show more stable electrochemical performance. Based on this principle, one regulated composite material (MnOx/BC-650) gives an ultra-stable capacity of 446.9 mAh(.)g(-1) at 500 mA.g(-1) after 200 cycles. This study provides new insight for both revealing the true structure of manganese oxides and developing long-term stable MnO-containing anode materials for LIBs.

Nephrotoxicity due to oxidative stress and inflammation is the main adverse effect of cisplatin. In the present study, rats with cisplatininduced nephrotoxicity were treated with LTP to investigate its potential protective effect. The results showed that LTP treatment has multiple protective effects on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. It significantly improved clinical indicators such as survival rate, water intake, food intake, body weight, and mobility, as well as physiological indexes such as reduced renal index and levels of serum urea, creatinine, and total bilirubin; pathological indicators such as reduced tubular injury, inflammatory infiltration, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and apoptosis; cell survival indicators such as decreased protein levels of Caspase-3 and Bax and increased Bcl-2; antioxidation status such as reduced malondialdehyde content and increased activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase; and reduced inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha in kidney tissues. Specially, LTP treatment did not influence the anticancer effect of cisplatin as observed in the solid tumor mouse model established by subcutaneously inoculating H22 cells. Moreover, LTP did not influence the physiological and pathological indicators of normal rats, suggesting its biological safety. In conclusion, LTP can protect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity through its anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis effects, without influencing the anticancer effect of cisplatin.

However, these simple, single-step syntheses lack scalability due to the need of high temperatures and autogenous pressures to enable the dissolution of reagents and crystallization of the product. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time fast continuous synthesis of ceria nanoparticles at moderate conditions through the combination of the deep eutectic solvent reline (an eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea) as reaction medium and the high heat and mass transfer rate offered by microreactors. Almost 100% yields are obtained within 100 s of residence time at 160 degrees C, with some conversion achieved even at temperatures as low as 120 degrees C. Such rapid synthesis takes place thanks to the molecular structure of the solvent which facilitates the fast nucleation of cerium oxycarbonate as an intermediate product. As expected in a kinetically controlled system, pressure and initial cerium concentration have negligible effects on the yield obtained. The rapid reaction, the cheap, benign, and environmentally friendly solvent, and the lack of additional additives in this work opens the door to sustainable large-scale continuous synthesis of ceria nanoparticles as well as other nanostructured materials.

In this work, we demonstrated that the HER activity of inert Ni3N nanoparticles could be significantly improved through high dispersion of trace-loaded Pt on their surface. In detail, Ni3N/Ni@C with controllable Ni content was prepared via the urea-urea-glass-route by controlling the calcination temperature and time based on the thermal unstability of Ni3N. Followed by the galvanic replacement between Ni and a platinum precursor, Ni3N/Ni@C decorated with a trace amount (0.45 wt%) of Pt was simply prepared. The trace-loaded catalyst exhibited greatly enhanced HER activity and stability in entire pH range including in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH and 0.2 M PBS (pH = 7), which could be comparable to commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst. For example, they held low overpotential of 117 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), small Tafel slope of 47.3 mV/dec, and large electrochemical surface area of 60.24 mF/cm(2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. The present work provides an intriguing strategy for developing trace loadings of noble metal electro-catalysts on inert materials with high HER performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, g-C3N4 catalysts were effectively synthesized through a simple thermal polymerization method, using melamine, urea, and thiourea as precursors to elucidate the influence of these compounds on the final product's photocatalytic performance. The degradation of a mixture of three parabens was investigated under different types of radiation: two artificial, ultraviolet-A (UVA) and visible LED, and natural sunlight. The urea-based catalyst (UCN) presented better results under all radiation sources, followed by thiourea, and finally, melamine. Among the artificial light sources, the degradation of parabens under UVA was considerably higher than visible-up to 51% and 21%, respectively-using UCN; however, the broader spectrum of natural sunlight was able to achieve the highest removals, up to 92%, using UCN. Comparing artificial radiation sources, UVA lamps presented 45% lower energy consumption and associated costs. Photocatalytic ozonation was tested using UCN and MCN, with UCN once more possessing superior performance and a synergetic effect between photocatalysis and ozonation, with complete removal under 12 min. The use of g-C3N4 was then successfully tested in initial screening and found to be an efficient alternative in more low-cost and feasible solar photocatalysis water treatment.

J	Zhu, W; Chang, LM; Zhao, T; Wang, B; Jiang, JP				Zhu, Wei; Chang, Liming; Zhao, Tian; Wang, Bin; Jiang, Jianping			Remarkable metabolic reorganization and altered metabolic requirements in frog metamorphic climax	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY												Background Metamorphic climax is the crucial stage of amphibian metamorphosis responsible for the morphological and functional changes necessary for transition to a terrestrial habitat. This developmental period is sensitive to environmental changes and pollution. Understanding its metabolic basis and requirements is significant for ecological and toxicological research.Rana omeimontistadpoles are a useful model for investigating this stage as their liver is involved in both metabolic regulation and fat storage. Results We used a combined approach of transcriptomics and metabolomics to study the metabolic reorganization during natural and T3-driven metamorphic climax in the liver and tail ofRana omeimontistadpoles. The metabolic flux from the apoptotic tail replaced hepatic fat storage as metabolic fuel, resulting in increased hepatic amino acid and fat levels. In the liver, amino acid catabolism (transamination and urea cycle) was upregulated along with energy metabolism (TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation), while the carbohydrate and lipid catabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and beta-oxidation) decreased. The hepatic glycogen phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis were upregulated, and the carbohydrate flux was used for synthesis of glycan units (e.g., UDP-glucuronate). In the tail, glycolysis, beta-oxidation, and transamination were all downregulated, accompanied by synchronous downregulation of energy production and consumption. Glycogenolysis was maintained in the tail, and the carbohydrate flux likely flowed into both PPP and the synthesis of glycan units (e.g., UDP-glucuronate and UDP-glucosamine). Fatty acid elongation and desaturation, as well as the synthesis of bioactive lipid (e.g., prostaglandins) were encouraged in the tail during metamorphic climax. Protein synthesis was downregulated in both the liver and tail. The significance of these metabolic adjustments and their potential regulation mechanism are discussed. Conclusion The energic strategy and anabolic requirements during metamorphic climax were revealed at the molecular level. Amino acid made an increased contribution to energy metabolism during metamorphic climax. Carbohydrate anabolism was essential for the body construction of the froglets. The tail was critical in anabolism including synthesizing bioactive metabolites. These findings increase our understanding of amphibian metamorphosis and provide background information for ecological, evolutionary, conservation, and developmental studies of amphibians.					朱, 玮/HKN-1733-2023; Chang, Liming/JWO-1229-2024	ZHAO, Tian/0000-0003-2000-9187; Chang, Liming/0000-0002-2411-6978													1742-9994					OCT 8	2020	17	1							30	10.1186/s12983-020-00378-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-020-00378-6								33062031					WOS:000577524400001
J	Yin, XZ; Liu, ZJ; Wang, J				Yin, Xunzhe; Liu, Zuojia; Wang, Jin			Tetrahydropalmatine ameliorates hepatic steatosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by switching lipid metabolism via AMPK-SREBP-1c-Sirt1 signaling axis	PHYTOMEDICINE												Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a global epidemic without effective treatment currently available. NAFLD is characterized by an increase in hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and inadequate compensatory enhancement in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which disturbs lipid homeostasis. In NAFLD, lipid metabolism relies heavily on metabolic reprogramming. Moreover, lipid metabolism plays an essential role in switching between lipogenesis and FAO, which is beneficial for the anti-NAFLD therapy. Our recent study demonstrated that the phytochemical tetrahydropalmatine (THP) has positive efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it remains unclear whether the therapeutic benefits of THP are primarily due to delaying the progression of hepatic steatosis to HCC. Purpose: This work aimed to systemically evaluate the pharmacological functions and underlying mechanisms of THP in NAFLD using both in vitro and in vivo models. Methods: NAFLD models were established using high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice in vivo and palmitic acid- and oleic acid-challenged hepatocytes in vitro. Metabonomics analysis concomitant with biochemical indices and computational biology assays were performed comprehensively to reveal the key link between the treatment of NAFLD and the AMPK-SREBP-1c-Sirt1 signaling axis. Results: Hepatic metabolomics analysis revealed that THP altered lipid metabolism by enhancing FAO and inhibiting glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and urea cycle in HFD-fed mice. Analysis of gene expression showed that THP profoundly suppressed hepatic DNL and promoted FAO. THP supplementation not only significantly decreased body/liver weight gain and serum indices but also ameliorated hepatic steatosis. Simultaneously, impaired lipotoxicity was observed in vivo and in vitro after THP supplementation, protecting against steatosis-driven injury. Metabolic phenotype assays showed that THP promoted switching from glycolysis inhibition to FAO enhancement in steatotic cells, resulting in reprogramming lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, THP accelerated lipid oxidation by activating AMPK-SREBP-1c-Sirt1 axis signaling. Applying molecular docking combined with surface plasmon resonance and cellular thermal shift assay target engagement, as well as siRNA assays, AMPK alpha was confirmed as a direct molecular target of THP. Conclusion: In summary, THP ameliorates hepatic steatosis in NAFLD by switching lipid metabolism via the AMPK-SREBP-1c-Sirt1 pathway. This work provides an attractive phytochemical component for therapy against hepatic steatosis in NAFLD.

Metabolic signatures of pregnancy-induced cardiac growth	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY												The goal of this study was to develop an atlas of the metabolic, transcriptional, and proteomic changes that occur with pregnancy in the maternal heart. Timed pregnancy studies in FVB/NJ mice revealed a significant increase in heart size by day 8 of pregnancy (midpregnancy; MP), which was sustained throughout the rest of the term compared with nonpregnant control mice. Cardiac hypertrophy and myocyte cross-sectional area were highest 7 days after birth (postbirth; PB) and were associated with significant increases in end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes and higher cardiac output. Metabolomics analyses revealed that by day 16 of pregnancy (late pregnancy; LP) metabolites associated with nitric oxide production as well as acylcholines, sphingomyelins, and fatty acid species were elevated, which coincided with a lower activation state of phosphofructokinase and higher levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) and p-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (Bdh1). In the postpartum period, urea cycle metabolites, polyamines, and phospholipid levels were markedly elevated in the maternal heart. Cardiac transcriptomics in LP revealed significant increases in not only Pdk4 and Bdhl but also genes that regulate glutamate and ketone body oxidation, which were preceded in MP by higher expression of transcripts controlling cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Proteomics analysis of the maternal heart in LP and PB revealed significant reductions in several contractile filament and mitochondria) subunit complex proteins. Collectively, these findings describe the coordinated molecular changes that occur in the maternal heart during and after pregnancy. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Little is known of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to pregnancyinduced cardiac growth. Several lines of evidence suggest that changes in cardiac metabolism may contribute. Here, we provide a comprehensive metabolic atlas of the metabolomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic changes occurring in the maternal heart. We show that pregnancy-induced cardiac growth is associated with changes in glycerophospholipid, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism, with reductions in cardiac glucose catabolism. Collectively, these results suggest that substantial metabolic changes occur in the maternal heart during and after pregnancy.

Replacing the OER with thermodynamically more favorable reactions has the potential to significantly reduce electricity consumption and boost cathodic hydrogen generation. In this review, we first summarized the recent advancement of hydrogen production assisted by various alternative anodic reactions, with a special focus on the current status of coal and biomass, which are especially rich in resources. Other auxiliary chemicals such as sulfite, organic contaminants, urea, and carbon are also reviewed. Key indicators such as current densities and corresponding cell voltages are compared.

Polyurethane Microparticles for Stimuli Response and Reduced Oxidative Degradation in Highly Porous Shape Memory Polymers	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES												Shape memory polymers (SMPs) have been found to be promising biomaterials for a variety of medical applications; however, the clinical translation of such technology is dependent on tailorable properties such as gravimetric changes in degradation environments. For SMPs synthesized from amino-alcohols, oxidation resulting in rapid mass loss may be problematic in terms of loss of material functionality as well as toxicity and cytocompatibility concerns. Control of gravimetric changes was achieved through the incorporation of small molecule antioxidants, either directly into the polymer matrix or included in microparticles to form a SMP composite material. With direct incorporation of small molecule phenolic antioxidant 2,2'-methylenebis(6-tert-butyl)-methylphenol (Methyl), SMPs displayed reduce strain recovery by more than 50% (Methyl) and increase elastic modulus from approximately 1.4 to 2.3 MPa, at the expense of the strain to failure being reduced from 45% to 32%. Importantly, such changes could not ensure retention of the antioxidants and therefore did not increase oxidative stability beyond 15 days in accelerated oxidative conditions (equivalent to approximately 800 days in porcine aneurysms) in all cases except for the inclusion of a hindered amine that capped network growth, which also resulted in shape memory reduction (only 80% recoverable strain achieved). However, the inclusion of antioxidants in microparticles was found to produce materials with similar thermomechanical (T-g migration below 1.0 degrees C) and shape recovery of 100%, while increasing oxidative resistance compared to controls (oxidation onset was delayed by 3 days and material lifespan increased to. approximately 20-22 days in accelerated oxidative solution or beyond 1000 days in the porcine aneurysm). The microparticle composite SMPs also act as a platform for environmental sensing, such as pH-dependent fluorescence shifts and payload release, as demonstrated by fluorescent dye studies using phloxine B and nile blue chloride and the release of antioxidants over a 3 week period. The use of polyurethane-urea microparticles in porous SMPs is demonstrated to increase biostability of the materials, by approximately 25%, and ultimately extend their lifespan for use in aneurysm occlusion as determined through calculated in vivo degradation rates corresponding to a porcine aneurysm environment.

Results All nine volunteers completed the 2 days and are included in the analysis. Circulating concentrations of glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate increased during KET (mean +/- SEM 17.7 +/- 0.6 mmol/l and 1.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, respectively), then decreased after insulin treatment (6.6 +/- 0.7 mmol/l and 0.1 +/- 0.07 mmol/l, respectively). Prior to insulin infusion (KET vs CTR) isotopically determined endogenous glucose production rates were 17 +/- 1.7 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1) vs 8 +/- 1.3 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1) (p = 0.003), whole body phenylalanine fluxes were 2.9 +/- 0.5 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1) vs 3.1 +/- 0.4 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1) (p = 0.77) and urea excretion rates were 16.9 +/- 2.4 g/day vs 7.3 +/- 1.7 g/day (p = 0.01). Insulin failed to stimulate forearm glucose uptake and glucose oxidation in KET compared with CTR (p < 0.05). Glycogen synthase phosphorylation was impaired in skeletal muscle. Conclusions/interpretation In KET, hyperglycaemia is primarily driven by increased endogenous glucose production. Insulin stimulation during early phases of DKA is associated with reduced glucose disposal in skeletal muscle, impaired glycogen synthase function and lower glucose oxidation. This underscores the presence of muscle insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of DKA.

The objectives of the present study were to quantify amino acid (AA) fluxes and heat production across portal-drained viscera (PDV) and liver in multiparous sows during transition and lactation. Methods Eight second parity sows were fitted with indwelling catheters in the femoral artery and in the mesenteric, portal and hepatic veins. Eight hourly sets of blood samples were taken starting 0.5 h before feeding at - 10, - 3, + 3, and + 17 d in milk (DIM). Blood gases, plasma metabolites and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients were measured. Results Feed intake, the ATTD of DM, energy, nitrogen, fat and crude fiber changed with DIM (P < 0.001). Except for Glu, O-2, and urea, all net portal fluxes were positive, and all were affected by DIM (P < 0.05) and by sampling time (P < 0.01). Compared with pre partum levels, net portal uptake of AA was 3-63% lower at + 3 DIM but 40-100% higher at + 17 DIM. Net portal fluxes of AA peaked at 1.5 to 2.5 h after feeding except for Glu, and they were positively correlated with changes in sow feed intake across DIM. The net portal recovery was low for Met (49%), Thr (54%), and His (54%) and high for the remaining essential AA (63-69%) and none of them differed across DIM. Net hepatic uptake (i.e. hepatic oxidation) of Lys, Thr, Ile, Leu and Phe peaked at 0.5 to 2.5 h after feeding, whereas uptake of Trp, Val, and His was constant, while that of Met was close to zero. Conclusion The net portal recovery was substantially lower for Met, Thr, and His than the remaining essential AA. Hepatic AA oxidation peaks 0.5 to 2.5 h after feeding. The heat production in PDV and liver was approximately two-fold higher at peak lactation compared to other stages. The study suggests that lysine was the limiting AA in peak lactation but not in early lactation.

Hemorrhagic shock is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care units in patients under the age of 35. Several organs, including the lungs, are seriously affected by hemorrhagic shock and inadequate resuscitation. Excess free fatty acids have shown to trigger inflammation in various disease conditions. C75 is a small compound that inhibits fatty acid synthase, a key enzyme in the control of fatty acid metabolism that also stimulates fatty acid oxidation. We hypothesized that C75 treatment would be protective against hemorrhagic shock. Methods. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were cannulated with a femoral artery catheter and subjected to controlled bleeding. Blood was shed to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 30 mm Hg for 90 minutes, then resuscitated over 30 minutes with a crystalloid volume equal to twice the volume of shed blood. Fifteen minutes into the 30-minute resuscitation, the rats received either intravenous infusion of C75 (1 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (20% dimethyl sulfoxide). Blood and tissue samples were collected 6 hours after resuscitation (ie, 7.5 hours after hemorrhage) for analysis. Results. After hemorrhage and resuscitation, C75 treatment decreased the increase in serum free fatty acids by 48%, restored adenosine triphosphate levels, and stimulated carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 activity. Administration of C75 decreased serum levels of markers of injury (aspartate aminotransferase, lactate, and lactate dehydrogenase) by 38%, 32%, and 78 %, respectively. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were also decreased significantly by 38 % and 40%, respectively. These changes correlated with decreases in neutrophil infiltration in the lung, evidenced by decreases in Gr-1 stained cells and myeloperoxidase activity and improved lung histology). Finally, administration of C75 decreased pulmonary mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-6 by 8 7 % and 65%, respectively. Conclusion. Administration of C75 after hemorrhage and resuscitation decreased the increase in serum free fatty acids, decreased markers of tissue injury, downregulated the expression of inflammatory mediators, and decreased neutrophil infiltration and lung injury. Thus, the dual action of inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and stimulating fatty acid oxidation by C75 could be developed as a promising adjuvant therapy strategy to protect against hemorrhagic shock.

J	Essaïed, KA; Brown, LV; von Gunten, U				Essaied, Karim-Alexandre; Brown, Lucy Victoria; von Gunten, Urs			Reactions of amines with ozone and chlorine: Two novel oxidative methods to evaluate the N-DBP formation potential from dissolved organic nitrogen	WATER RESEARCH												The composition of oxidant-reactive dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is poorly characterized, although its ozonation is likely to form a great variety of disinfection by-products containing a nitrogen-oxygen bond (NDBPs). In this study, two chemical oxidation procedures were developed: continuous ozonation at pH 7.0 and free available chlorine (FAC) titrations at pH 9.2. The formation of two oxidation products (nitrate (NO3 ) and chloramines, respectively) was used to quantify and characterize oxidant-reactive nitrogenous moieties in DON. In addition, batch experiments were conducted to study the NO3 yields of 30 selected nitrogenous model compounds upon ozonation. The NO3 yields of 12 primary and secondary amines were highly variable (17-100%, specific ozone dose of 20 molO3/molN), 7 amino acids had high NO3 yields (>= 90%), and tertiary amines as well as pyrrole, acetamide and urea had low NO3 yields (<= 15%). The mechanisms of NO3 formation were further examined with benzylamine and N-methylbenzylamine as model compounds. Our results show that nitroalkanes are the last intermediate products before the formation of NO3 , both for primary and secondary amines. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group in the vicinity of the N-atom facilitates the formation of NO3 from nitroalkanes. Therefore, the formation of NO3 is attributed to amino acids and activated primary and secondary amines. In contrast, all primary and secondary amines were transformed to chloramines upon chlorination, which was determined by a novel oxidative titration with chlorine. To further support the selectivity of this assay, it was demonstrated by derivatization of amine moieties that chloramine formation could be inhibited. 13-45% of the DON of 4 dissolved organic matter isolates and 2 wastewater effluents formed NO3 and 0-39% formed chloramines, indicating that the potential for N-DBP formation is high (mu MN/mgC-level). From differences in the formation of NO3 and chloramines the nature of the precursors can be hypothesized (e.g., activated or nonactivated primary and secondary amines, partially oxidized nitrogenous compounds). This study highlights the capacity of two novel methods to characterize the oxidant-reactive DON fraction. Our results suggest that this fraction is significant and could form a variety of potentially toxic N-DBPs.					von Gunten, Urs/O-1637-2013														0043-1354	1879-2448				FEB 1	2022	209								117864	10.1016/j.watres.2021.117864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117864		NOV 2021						34847390					WOS:000724975900011

The mass ratio of urea-formaldehyde resin based carbon material and commercial activated carbon was adjusted to regulate the nitrogen content. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used as an oxidant to optimize the physical and chemical properties of the material by the hydrothermal method. Dynamic adsorption results indicated that the sample with the moderate specific surface area (236.4 m(2) g(-1)) and moderate nitrogen content (16.36 at.%) obtained a maximum amount of formaldehyde (HCHO) adsorption of 4.30 mg g(-1). A very high linear correlation between the amount of HCHO adsorbed per unit specific surface area and total surface nitrogen content (R-2 = 0.99682) was observed. Through theoretical calculations, the positively charged H attached to the pyrrolic-N group and the negatively charged O atoms in the HCHO molecule increased the adsorption energy. Accordingly, for the high HCHO adsorption capacity, specific surface area was the primary determinant, while surface functional group was the secondary determinant. It is expected that the results could provide a viable method for the design of the pore structure and nitrogen content of activated carbon materials.					li, long/HOF-6990-2023; ma, weiwu/ABB-7407-2020; Zeng, Zheng/W-4263-2017; Liu, keke/HKF-4509-2023; li, liqing/JSL-1191-2023	li, liqing/0000-0001-8297-309X													2468-0230					JUN	2021	24								101038	10.1016/j.surfin.2021.101038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfin.2021.101038		MAR 2021											WOS:000663427200002

A 517, 2017, 52-62]. In the present contribution, the influences of three key synthesis parameters, including the 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) content, reaction temperature, and urea amount, on the particle properties of the Au/SiO2 NCs were systematically investigated. The role of these synthesis parameters in the formation of SiO2 nanosupports and Au nanoparticles (NPs) was discovered. The RR-like SiO2 nanosupports could only be formed in the systems within the range of 20-80 mol% of APTES content, at reaction temperatures above 60 degrees C, and with more than 0.72 mg of urea. The AuCl4- ions could be immobilized onto the aminopropyl-functionalized SiO2 nanosupports through a coordination interaction. The immobilized ions were reduced by the aminopropyl groups at elevated temperatures. The APTES content and reaction temperature play an important role in controlling the particle size and its distribution of Au NPs. The catalytic activity of Au/SiO2 NCs depends significantly on the APTES content. The RR-like Au/SiO2 NCs with smaller immobilized Au NPs and higher specific surface area display higher catalytic activity towards hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol.

The Pd-C3N4@TNT catalyst has been characterized by BET surface area and pore size distribution, X-ray diffraction, solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The Pd-C3N4@TNT is a green catalyst for the Miziroki-Heck and Suzuki-Miyaura C-C coupling reactions in water medium with high efficiency (> 99% product yields) due to atomic level immobilization of Pd in C3N4 networked titanate nanotubes. Pd-C3N4@TNT is robust against leaching and agglomeration due to stable and furthermore it is recyclable and usable at least for five repeated cycles. The use of water as solvent, absence of leaching and agglomeration, recyclability and reusability ascertains the greenness of Pd-C3N4@TNT) catalyst and process.

The all-cellulose composite filaments (CF) containing only 3 wt % NFC exhibits a high orientation that Herman's parameter is 0.89. Importantly, the NFC can simultaneously reinforce and toughen the CF, with a tensile strength and elongation at break of 3.92 cN/dT and 14.6%, respectively, which make the obtained CF to become super strong. The strengthened mechanism of CF is considered as the nanofibril-induced crystallization and orientation, which makes up for the deficits and constructs a flawless structure in the regenerated cellulose filaments. Of note, the stability of spinning dope was also effectively improved by adding small amount of NFC, which is very important for fiber spinning on industry. This finding contributes to the preparation of high performance regenerated cellulose multifilaments by a simple, energy-efficient, and eco-friendly route.					wang, yiran/IAP-0414-2023; Chen, Feng/AFH-2421-2022	Zhang, Lina/0000-0003-3890-8690													1525-7797	1526-4602				NOV	2018	19	11					4386	4395		10.1021/acs.biomac.8b01262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.8b01262								30265795					WOS:000450374100022

First of all, a novel maleic anhydride-based polyamine (MAN) was designed and synthesized, characterized by its branched structure replete with numerous reactive sites. Subsequently, utilizing sucrose, MAN, and sucrase (I), a novel sucrose-based adhesive (S-I-MAN) was synthesized, capable of fostering a multifaceted chemical network through enzyme-catalyzed air oxidation cross-linking. And the enzyme-catalysed air oxidation reaction can provide a milder and more specific reaction pathway when catalysed by sucrase. Next, the laminated composites prepared from wood and biomass adhesive (S-I-MAN) exhibited excellent flame retardant properties by organic-inorganic surface modification using tannic acid (TA) and sodium perborate (NaBO3). Further research showed that potassium persulfate can effectively initiate the free radical polymerisation of the carbon-carbon double bond in S-I-MAN, increase the strength and stability of S-I-MAN, and make the laminated composites have more excellent mechanical properties. On the one hand this study developed a new organic-inorganic biomassbased composite adhesive. On the other hand, the surface modification of laminated composites with excellent flame retardant properties provided a new "organic-inorganic composite system with flame retardant" idea.

Due to the important role of urease produced by H. pylori in its initial colonization, survival, and infection, the activity inhibition of urease has been proven to be a promising therapeutic strategy for H. pylori infection. Therefore, the screening of effective urease inhibitors has become an important direction for the development of new therapeutic drugs. In this study, a novel biosensor for rapid screening of H. pylori urease inhibitors was constructed based on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified by heterologously expressed H. pylori 26695 urease b subunit (HPUb), Pt nanoparticles, and nanoporous gold (NPG). Five inhibitors were successfully screened for HPUb using the proposed biosensor (HPUb/Pt/NPG/GCE). The inhibition constants calculated according to the established mathematical model indicated that the inhibitory intensity order of these inhibitors was methylurea > acetamide > formamide > acetohydroxamic acid > hydroxyurea. Combining the inhibition constant of urease inhibitors with the molecular binding mechanism of the urease inhibitor and HPUb, it can be inferred that the non-polar longchain modification of one of the primary amino groups based on the molecular structure of urea is a promising direction for the development of high-efficiency urease inhibitors. The elucidation of this mechanism will provide a theoretical foundation and new ideas for the design of competitive urease inhibitors based on urea structure and the development of new anti H. pylori drugs.

Serum concentrations of urea (P<0.001), total protein and globulins were higher and ratio of albumin: globulin was lower (P<0.05) in T-2 and T-3 as compared T-1. However, serum total cholesterol was lower (P<0.05) in T-3, only. Thus, it is concluded that supplementation of fish oil in captive Indian leopards would improve protein digestion and reduce serum cholesterol without affecting diet palatability, nutrient utilization and haematology.

A review of the literature of selective catalytic reduction catalysts integrated into diesel particulate filters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH												Combining the functions of selective catalytic reduction with the diesel particulate filter provides the opportunity in light- to heavy-duty applications for design and packaging flexibility, improved thermal management and reduction of the aftertreatment system volume, mass and cost. This integration can be achieved by washcoating the selective catalytic reduction catalyst on and/or in the diesel particulate filter substrate wall. With packaging flexibility and closer placement of the selective catalytic reduction system to the engine, the aftertreatment system can achieve faster light-off and can operate at higher temperatures. Despite these advantages, there are many challenges associated with the integrated selective catalytic reduction-in-diesel particulate filter technology. This review provides a comparative analysis of the advantages and limitations of the selective catalytic reduction-in-diesel particulate filter technology based on the published literature to date. It summarizes the significant accomplishments for selective catalytic reduction-in-diesel particulate filter technology research and development, including optimization and performance characterization studies based on experimental and modeling effort and the needs for future research and development.

Here, we report a Cu single-atom dispersed Rh metallene arrays on Cu foam for cathodic nitrobenzene electroreduction reaction and anodic methanol oxidation reaction. In the coupled electrocatalytic system, the Cusingle-atom-Rh metallene arrays on Cu foam requires only the low voltages of 1.18 V to reach current densities of 100 mA cm(-2) for generating aniline and formate, with up to similar to 100% of nitrobenzene conversion/ aniline selectivity and over similar to 90% of formate Faraday efficiency, achieving synthesis of high-value chemicals. Density functional theory calculations reveal the electron effect between Cu single-atom and Rh host and catalytic reaction mechanism. The synergistic catalytic effect and H*-spillover effect can improve catalytic reaction process and reduce energy barrier for reaction process, thus enhancing electrocatalytic reaction activity and target product selectivity.

Multivariate effect of inorganic wastewater matrix on the removal of pesticides by solar photo-Fenton	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												An amount of works has reported the effect of wastewater matrix composition on pollutants removal by different AOPs. The biggest challenge is that each wastewater source has a challenging composition (organic and inorganic compounds, pollutants, etc.) and not only the concentration of all these species but also the interaction between them may affect the effectiveness of the studied process. This work has been carried out to evaluate the photo-degradation kinetics of six different pesticides (flutriafol, imidacloprid, myclobutanil, pirimicarb, thiamethoxam and triadimenol) by solar photo-Fenton (SPF) process at acidic pH. First, oxidant concentration (H2O2) was optimized with an actual WWTP effluent. Then, the process was validated with two different secondary and tertiary WWTP effluents, in which main intermediate transformation by-products were identified. Finally, the effect of the inorganic water matrix components (bicarbonate, chloride, sulphate, nitrate and phosphate) was evaluated by a multivariate analysis. Once H2O2 has been optimized at 30 mg L-1, the photodegradation efficiency of pesticides in real wastewater samples was compared. DOC content of both secondary and tertiary WWTP effluents was dropped by 67%. The identification of the main intermediate transformation by-products (such as 1H-1,2,4-triazole, desmethyl-formamido pirimicarb, thiamethoxam urea, chloronicotinic acid and imidacloprid urea) was reviewed. Following, the multivariate analysis on pesticides photo-degradation, generally, predicted four significant effects in common for the studied pesticides: a positive effect (interaction bicarbonate/nitrate) and three negative ones (chloride, phosphate and the interaction chloride/sulphate); among others. In addition, optimum values of inorganic ion concentrations, to obtain an optimum desirability on studied pesticides removal by SPF at acidic pH, were also evaluated.

These pollutants, which contain nitro compounds and organic dyes, are extremely dangerous due to their toxic and carcinogenic nature. An efficient, environmentally benign, and economical catalyst to degrade environmental pollutants or convert them into useful products has been of sustained interest in recent years. In this context, we report a simple and inexpensive combustion fabrication of NiCrFeO4 using different fuels such as glycine, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and urea, showing tremendous catalytic and photocatalytic functionalities. Rietveld refinement and X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the formation of single-phase ferrites, with crystallite sizes ranging from 3.9 to 43.31 nm. The values of optical band gap, obtained from the diffused reflectance spectroscopy technique, lie in the visible region range (1.50-1.60 eV), and hence, all the synthesized ferrites can act as good photocatalysts in the presence of visible light. All the NCF nanocatalysts were utilized for the reduction of nitroarenes and photocatalytic degradation of various cationic (RhB and MB) and anionic (MO) dyes and their mixture. NCFP displayed excellent activity for the reduction and oxidation reactions owing to its large surface area and low optical band gap. Furthermore, the photo-oxidative degradation by NCFP was also enhanced due to its low recombination of charge carriers as confirmed by the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. NCFP efficiently reduces nitrobenzene to aminobenzene with 95% yield using sodium borohydride as the reducing agent in methanol medium at RT in 10 min. The results of photocatalytic activity have shown that the degradation efficiency of NCFP follows the order RhB > MB > MO in their unitary solution. Furthermore, in the case of the mixture of dyes, NCFP showed enhanced photocatalytic degradation for cationic dyes (RhB and MB) compared to that of anionic dye (MO). From the performance point of view, this catalyst can be useful in industrial application because of its high stability, greater catalytic efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

A novel sensor based on electropolymerized substituted-phenols for pH detection in unbuffered systems	RSC ADVANCES												This work summarizes the electrochemical response of a range of substituted phenols, including salicylaldehyde and salicylic acid, for use as a voltammetric pH sensor for the determination of pH in both buffered and unbuffered media. Suitable candidates are identified and mechanistic insights into oxidation mechanism of the electro-polymerization by comparing with other substituted phenols are given. Square wave voltammetry measurements suggest the peak achieved through the electrochemical polymerization directly after the 1-electron 1-proton oxidation for both salicylaldehyde and salicylic acid shows a Nernstian response with good definition through a pH range from 2 to 10.

Terminal and 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, as well as dienes, participate in this three-component coupling reaction. The reaction mechanism likely involves the addition of an alkyl radical to the styrene, followed by metal-mediated oxidative coupling of the resulting benzylic radical with the amine derivative.

Shorter b-axis brings about shorter diffusion channel, which can leads to higher adsorption and diffusion rate. Therefore, with regard to the morphology modification of MFI zeolites, many studies touch on short b-axis zeolites have been reported. Unfortunately, most of the preparation processes require harsh synthesis conditions and complex organic templates, and they are not conducive to large-scale applications. In this work, cheap organic additive urea and seed crystals were added to synthesize sheet-like TS-1, which boasts short b-axis. At the same time a pre-crystallization was performed at the aging solution stage. In the b-axis direction, the zeolite TS-1 prepared in this way had a minimum thickness of about 50 nm. This is because urea can inhibit the growth of crystals in the b-axis direction, and the guiding effect of the seed liquid also plays the function of adjusting the b-axis thickness. In the epoxidation of 1-hexene with H2O2 when catalyzed by sheet-like TS-1, the selectivity of the target product 1,2-epoxyhexane was significantly improved.

J	Liao, CC; Lin, YL; Kuo, CF				Liao, Chen-Chung; Lin, Ya-Lin; Kuo, Chia-Feng			Effect of High-Fat Diet on Hepatic Proteomics of Hamsters	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												A high-fat diet contributes to the etiology of metabolic diseases. As the liver plays a crucial role in metabolism, an insight into the hepatic proteomics will help to illustrate the physiological effect of a high-fat diet. Fourteen nine-week old male Syrian hamsters were maintained on either control (C) or high-fat (HF) diets (0.2% cholesterol +22% fat) for 8 weeks. Hamsters were chosen because they show close similarity to human lipid metabolism. At the end of study, blood and livers were collected for analysis. Liver proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis, digested by trypsin, and then separated by label-free nano-LC/MS/MS. The TurboSequest algorithm was used to identify the peptide sequences against the hamster database in Universal Proteins Resource Knowledge-base (UniProt). The results indicate that 1191 hepatic proteins were identified and 135 of them were expressed differentially in the high-fat group (p < 0.05). Some of these 135 proteins that involve in metabolic diseases were further validated by Western blotting. The animals maintained on the high-fat diet had significantly (p < 0.05) higher serum triglyceride, cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and uric acid. Animals consuming a high-fat diet also had significantly (p < 0.05) more accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol in livers. Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), which plays an important role in uric acid synthesis, was up-regulated by the high-fat diet (p < 0.05). The a-subunit of hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase (HADHA), which catalyzes the second and third reactions of beta-oxidation, was down-regulated by the high-fat diet (p < 0.05). Aconitate hydratase 2 (ACO2), which catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in TCA cycle, was down-regulated in animals of the high-fat group (p < 0.05). Inflammatory markers annexin A3 (ANXA3) and annexin A5 (ANXA5) were up-regulated by the high-fat diet (p < 0.05). Moreover, enzymes involved in the urea cycle were suppressed by high-fat diet, including carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), and arginase 1 (ARG 1). Post-translational modifications (PTM) of ANXA3, ANXA5, and XDH were also analyzed. A set of differentially expressed proteins were identified as molecular markers for elucidating the pathological mechanism of high-fat diet.					chen, chen/GRY-7085-2022; Kuo, Chia-Feng/AAJ-1123-2020														0021-8561	1520-5118				FEB 18	2015	63	6					1869	1881		10.1021/jf506118j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf506118j								25634685					WOS:000349807400024

Morphology characterizations showed that as-prepared composite had sandwich structure interspersed on graphene oxide sheets. The LaCO3OH nano-sheets were self-organized into stratiform nano-structures, where spherical Co3O4 nano-particles with a diameter of 17-31 nm were homogeneously distributed between two adjacent LaCO3OH nano-sheets, forming sandwich structure. At the same time, the sandwich structure inlaid on the surface of two-dimensional GO, forming sandwich structure interspersed morphology. The results indicated that the amount of urea additive (m(N)) played a key role in the formation of the neoteric morphology. The LaCO3OH/Co3O4/graphene oxide composite showed optimized catalytic performance for methane combustion as 50% methane conversion at 315 degrees C and 90% at 420 degrees C when m((N))/m((LC))= 5, which can match the activity of noble metal catalysts. The enhanced catalytic performance was attributed to its unique loaded structure with high surface area and more exposed active sites, which showed enhanced application in methane combustion as a new type of Pt-group metals free catalyst. In addition, stability performance was systematically studied, indicating that the synthesized catalyst has great potential for industrial applications.

Food Xanthan Polysaccharide Sulfation Process with Sulfamic Acid	FOODS												Xanthan is an important polysaccharide with many beneficial properties. Sulfated xanthan derivatives have anticoagulant and antithrombotic activity. This work proposes a new method for the synthesis of xanthan sulfates using sulfamic acid. Various N-substituted ureas have been investigated as process activators. It was found that urea has the greatest activating ability. BBD of xanthan sulfation process with sulfamic acid in 1,4-dioxane has been carried out. It was shown that the optimal conditions for the sulfation of xanthan (13.1 wt% sulfur content) are: the amount of sulfating complex per 1 g of xanthan is 3.5 mmol, temperature 90 degrees C, duration 2.3 h. Sulfated xanthan with the maximum sulfur content was analyzed by physicochemical methods. Thus, in the FTIR spectrum of xanthan sulfate, in comparison with the initial xanthanum, absorption bands appear at 1247 cm(-1), which corresponds to the vibrations of the sulfate group. It was shown by GPC chromatography that the starting xanthan gum has a bimodal molecular weight distribution of particles, including a high molecular weight fraction with M-w > 1000 kDa and an LMW fraction with M-w < 600 kDa. It was found that the Mw of sulfated xanthan gum has a lower value (similar to 612 kDa) in comparison with the original xanthan gum, and a narrower molecular weight distribution and is characterized by lower PD values. It was shown by thermal analysis that the main decomposition of xanthan sulfate, in contrast to the initial xanthan, occurs in two stages. The DTG curve has two pronounced peaks, with maxima at 226 and 286 degrees C.

Nickel-based electrochemical sensor with a wide detection range for measuring hydroxyl ions and pH sensing	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The importance of hydroxyl ions concentration measurement in solution necessitates the development of suitable and simple sensing methods for online detection. To address this need, an electrochemical sensor was developed using nickel as the working electrode that enabled specificity towards hydroxyl ions and their successfully quantification. The electrochemical reaction between nickel and hydroxyl ions in solution generates a current which is proportional to the concentration of hydroxyl ions and consequently is also correlated to the pH of the solution. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques were used to prepare and activate the nickel electrode for detection. The analysis of chronoamperometric experiments in different solutions exhibited three calibration curves between the current and hydroxyl ion concentrations for three regions in the range of 0.3 mu M to 4.8 M with a short response time of 14 s. Up to now, no other hydroxyl ion sensor has been reported that can reach this detection limit. This sensor also holds promise to work perfectly in highly alkaline environments where only costly commercial electrodes are available to quantify pH. The results show three linear calibration curves between the current and pH of the solution over the pH range of 7.4 to 14.6. In addition to the wide detection range, the sensor exhibits a relative standard deviation percentage lower than 7% over 9 months of experiments, confirming repeatability of measurements and stability of the electrode. The potential of the proposed method to measure pH in real applications was demonstrated by testing the sensor in solutions containing urea, nitrates, phosphates, and sulfates.

This method gave a much higher product yield than the direct thermal decomposition of urea. The prepared g-C3N4 is active for the Knoevenagel condensation of an aldehyde or ketone with methylenic compounds, but the activity depends on the structure of basic nitrogen species. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that at least four types of nitrogen species are present in g-C3N4, including primary amines (-NH2), secondary amines (-NH-), tertiary nitrogen (N(-C)(3)), and pyridinic nitrogen (C=N-C). The amounts and types of these nitrogen species in g-C3N4 are closely related to the ureaidicyandiamide ratio in its precursor mixture. The catalytic activity of these nitrogen species in the inactivated Knoevenagel condensation system decreases in the order of -NH2 >-NH-> N(-C)(3) > C=N-C, while it is similar for the -NH2 and -NH species in the activated reaction system. This trend provides strong evidence for the abstraction of a proton from the methylenic compounds as the rate-determining step.

This study aims to investigate the effect of ferulic acid on nephrotoxicity induced by gentamicin (GM). In this study, rats were separated into 4 groups such that each containing 8 randomly selected rats: Control group, Ferulic Acid (FA) group, Gentamicin (GM) group and Gentamicin + Ferulic acid (GM + FA) group. Blood samples were collected after 24 hours following the 8-day trial period, and kidneys were taken out for histopathological evaluation. Serum urea, creatinine, uric acid and LDH analyses were performed in autoanalyzer while Malondialdehyde (MDA), Advanced Oxidized Protein Products (AOPP), Glutathione (GSH), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) analyses were performed in ELISA, and kidney tissues were also examined histopathologically. Urea (p < .001), creatinine (p < .001), MDA (p < .01), AOPP (p < .001), IL-6 (p < .01) and TNF-alpha (p < .001) levels were found to be statistically and significantly lowered in GM + FA group when compared to GM group. As a result, ferulic acid has reduced the inflammation in nephrotoxicity induced by GM, causing decreased oxidative stress. In this study, anti-inflammatory features of ferulic acid have come to the forefront rather than the antioxidant features. It can be said that ferulic acid reduces nephrotoxic damage and has protective properties for kidneys.

The use of solar illumination as a renewable energy associated to nanomaterials is an alternative solution for disinfection of wastewater. Therefore, there is a great challenge in green chemistry research to synthesize robust and efficient catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutant under visible light. In this study, we describe new ways to decorated mesoporous TiO(2)with cerium (Ce) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles. Indeed, mesoporous TiO(2)was co-doped with Ag and Ce using two different methods: co-impregnation (Co-IMP) and co-deposition precipitation with urea (Co-DPU). The prepared catalysts were characterized using different analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DR/UV-vis) and N(2)adsorption/desorption. The effect of the preparation method has been evaluated in the photodegradation of ibuprofen (IBP) under visible light irradiation. The obtained results underlined the improvement of photocatalytic activity of mesoporous TiO(2)by metals under visible light. A mineralization of IBP up to 98 % was achieved after 4 h irradiation for the catalyst prepared by co-deposition precipitation with urea. Therefore, this catalyst could be suitable for the treatment of pharmaceuticals in aqueous media using solar light as the energy source.

J	Cheuquepán, W; Orts, JM; Rodes, A				Cheuquepan, William; Orts, Jose Manuel; Rodes, Antonio			Hydroxyurea electrooxidation at gold electrodes. In situ infrared spectroelectrochemical and DFT characterization of adsorbed intermediates	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												The oxidation of hydroxyurea (H2NCONHOH, HU) at Au(100), Au(111) and Au(111)-25 nm thin film electrodes is studied spectroelectrochemically in perchloric acid solutions. HU, which in agreement with DFT results interacts weakly with the gold surfaces, oxidizes irreversibly at gold electrodes irrespective of the surface orientation. The in situ infrared external reflection spectra prove the formation of dissolved carbon dioxide and adsorbed cyanate as products of the HU electrooxidation reaction. A band at ca. 2230 cm(-1) can be related both to dissolved isocyanic acid coming from the protonation of adsorbed cyanate or to nitrous oxide coming from the oxidation of hydroxylamine, which is formed (together with adsorbed cyanate) upon the chemical decomposition of hydroxyurea. ATR-SEIRAS experiments allow the observation of other adsorbate bands that can be tentatively ascribed to reaction intermediates that conserve the NCN skeleton and are bonded to the metal by the nitrogen atoms at near on-top positions. Bonding to the surface can be either unidentate or bidentate, involving covalent-type bonds or dative bonding through the lone pairs of the N atoms. Some of the signals of the experimental spectra, in particular those appearing around 1800 cm(-1), can be assigned to the CO stretch of adsorbed intermediates having a nitrosyl group formed by oxidation of the NOH moiety (namely, adsorbed nitrosoformamide or its deprotonated form). The bands observed around 1650 cm(-1) can correspond either to the NO stretching mode of the former species or to the CO stretching modes of adspecies conserving the NOH group.

Biodegradable Zwitterionic Polymer Coatings for Magnesium Alloy Stents	LANGMUIR					3rd International Conference on Bioinspired and Zwitterionic Materials (ICBZM)	OCT 18-20, 2017	Tokyo, JAPAN					Degradable metallic stents, most commonly composed of Mg-based alloys, are of interest as an alternative to traditional metallic stents for application in cardiac and peripheral vasculature. Two major design challenges with such stents are control of the corrosion rate and acute presentation of a nonthrombogenic surface to passing blood. In this study, several types of sulfobetaine (SB)-bearing biodegradable polyurethanes were developed and assessed as physical, chemical, and combination-type coatings for a model degradable Mg alloy, AZ31. For physical coatings, poly(ester sulfobetaine)urethane ureas, PESBUUs were synthesized using variable monomers that allowed the incorporation of a varying extent of carboxyl groups. Introduction of the carboxyl groups was associated with faster polymer degradation time. Simple physical coating of PESBUUs reduced macro- and microscopic thrombogenic deposition together with good stability of the coating attachment compared to a control coating of polylactic-co-glycolic acid. For PESBUUs incorporating carboxyl groups (PESBUUs-COOH), these groups could be converted to siloxane groups (PESBUUs-Si), thus creating polymers that could be surface reacted with the oxidized or phytic acid treated AZ31 surface. Chemical (silanization) attachment of these polymers reduced underlying alloy corrosion rates, but following the salination reaction with physical coating most reduced corrosion rates and protected the surface better from the consequences of oxidation occurring under the coating, such as blistering. The application of a multilayered coating approach using a sulfobetaine-based biodegradable elastomer thus offers options for degradable metallic stent design where thromboresistance is desired in combination with a means to control both polymeric coating degradation rates and underlying alloy corrosion rates.

Acute hypoxia/reoxygenation affects muscle mitochondrial respiration and redox state as well as swimming endurance in zebrafish	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Rapid fluctuations of the oxygen content of both natural and anthropogenic origin are relatively common in freshwater environments. Fish adaptation to these conditions implies tolerance of both low levels of oxygen availability and reoxygenation. Hypoxia tolerance in fish has been widely studied, but the involvement of mitochondria in the response of fish to rapid hypoxia/reoxygenation stress is less known. Zebrafish, a floodplain species, is likely facing significant changes in dissolved oxygen in its natural environment and displays a moderate ability to tolerate hypoxia. In the present study, we report the effects of an acute hypoxia/reoxygenation stress (H/R) protocol on mitochondrial functionality (respiration, complex activities, rate of H2O2 release) and redox state (level of HPs and protein oxidation) of muscle tissue. In parallel, the animal metabolic performance (routine metabolism, nitrogen excretion and swimming performance) was measured. Additionally, the recovery from H/R was tested 20h after treatment. A significant stimulation by H/R of muscle mitochondrial respiration and H2O2 release was observed, which was only in part counteracted by stimulation of the antioxidant system, resulting in an increased level of lipid peroxides and protein carbonyls. In parallel, H/R increased the animal oxygen consumption and urea excretion rate and reduced routine activity. A significant strong reduction of endurance at 80% U-crit was also observed. Most of the altered parameter did not recover 20h after reoxygenation. These data indicate a significant alteration of zebrafish muscle mitochondrial state after acute H/R, associated with changes in tissue redox state and locomotor performance.

Asch. (Nitrariaceae) is a medicinal plant which produces edible fruits whose antioxidant activity has been demonstrated. Objective: The current study elucidates the potential protective effect of N. retusa fruit aqueous extract against nephrotoxicity induced by penconazole, a triazole fungicide, in the kidney of adult rats. Materials and methods: Adult Wistar rats were exposed either to penconazole (67 mg/kg body weight), or to N. retusa extract (300 mg/kg body weight) or to their combination. Penconazole was administered by intra-peritoneal injection every 2 days from day 7 until day 15, the sacrifice day, while N. retusa extract was administered daily by gavage during 15 days. Oxidative stress parameters, kidney biomarkers and histopathological examination were determined. Results: Nitraria retusa extract administration to penconazole treated rats decreased kidney levels of malondialdehyde (-10%), hydrogen peroxide (-12%), protein carbonyls (PCOs, -11%) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP, -16%); antioxidant enzyme activities: catalase (-13%), superoxide dismutase (-8%) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx, -14%), and the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants: non-protein thiols (-9%), glutathione (-7%) and metallothionein (-12%). Furthermore, this plant extract prevented kidney biomarker changes by reducing plasma levels of creatinine, urea, uric acid and LDH and increasing those of ALP and GGT. Histopathological alterations induced by penconazole (glomeruli fragmentation, Bowman's space enlargement, tubular epithelial cells necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory leucocytes) were attenuated following N. retusa administration. Discussion and conclusion: Our results indicated that N. retusa fruit extract had protective effects against penconazole-induced kidney injury, which could be attributed to its phenolic compounds.

Litchi (Litchi chinensis) fruit lose their attractive red color soon after harvest. The mechanism leading to quick degradation of anthocyanins in the pericarp is not well understood. An anthocyanin degradation enzyme (ADE) was purified to homogeneity by sequential column chromatography, using partially purified anthocyanins from litchi pericarp as a substrate. The purified ADE, of 116 kD by urea SDS-PAGE, was identified as a laccase (ADE/LAC). The full-length complementary DNA encoding ADE/LAC was obtained, and a polyclonal antibody raised against a deduced peptide of the gene recognized the ADE protein. The anthocyanin degradation function of the gene was confirmed by its transient expression in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves. The highest ADE/LAC transcript abundance was in the pericarp in comparison with other tissues, and was about 1,000-fold higher than the polyphenol oxidase gene in the pericarp. Epicatechin was found to be the favorable substrate for the ADE/LAC. The dependence of anthocyanin degradation by the enzyme on the presence of epicatechin suggests an ADE/LAC epicatechin-coupled oxidation model. This model was supported by a dramatic decrease in epicatechin content in the pericarp parallel to anthocyanin degradation. Immunogold labeling transmission electron microscopy suggested that ADE/LAC is located mainly in the vacuole, with essential phenolic substances. ADE/LAC vacuolar localization, high expression levels in the pericarp, and high epicatechin-dependent anthocyanin degradation support its central role in pigment breakdown during pericarp browning.

Herein, sulfur-doped molybdenum phosphide (S:MoP) is prepared using (thio)urea-phosphate-assisted strategy and investigated as anode material for Li- and Na-ion batteries. This approach provides the self-doping of sulfur in MoP lattice that stabilizes the least stable oxidation state of phosphorus (P-3) of MoP through Mo/P-S bonds, enhances the electronic conductivity, and maximizes the Li-/Na ions adsorption sites. The phase pure hexagonal S:MoP is obtained at 700 degrees C (S:MoP-7) and the complete reduction of phosphate is confirmed through X-ray diffraction as well as X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The presence of chemical bonding of Mo-P/S and P-S is detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. S:MoP-7 anode shows excellent rate capability where it delivers 112 mAh g(-1) capacity at 12.8 C rate and high stability with 436 mAh g(-1) capacity at 100th cycle at 0.1 C rate when tested in lithium-ion batteries. The S:MoP-7 as an anode exhibits high rate capability in sodium-ion batteries and delivers 133 mAh g(-1) capacity at 6.4 C rate and 307 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C rate at the 100th cycle. The high performance of the S:MoP-7 electrode is attributed to the interconnected porous network, increased active sites for Li- and Na-ions via S-doping, and reduced charge transfer resistance as observed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Herein, a new PI visible-light activation system was constructed to achieve efficient degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) employing single-atom Ag porous tubular carbon nitride with N-vacancies (SAAg/CN) as the catalyst, which was synthesized by one-step heat polymerization using silver tricyanomethanide with Ag-C bond as the silver source, urea, and melamine as precursors. Single-atom Ag promoted the photocatalytic performance effectively and optimized the utilization of metal atoms. The designed SAAg/CN/Vis-PI could achieve favorable synergy and realize complete degradation of SMX in 25 min with only 0.01 mg/L Ag leaching. PI showed excellent SMX degradation performance compared with other common oxidants with a benign pH tolerance (3.0-11.0), environmental stability, and reusability. No toxic iodine species were formed during the reaction because the main sort of reaction exhibited by PI was redox, rather than substitution. DFT calculation showed that N-vacancies broke the symmetry of g-C3N4, which facilitated charge transfer between g-C3N4 layers and the adsorption of PI. The combined action of single-atom Ag and N-vacancies effectively altered the band structure, enhancing the likelihood of electrons absorbing energy and undergoing transitions, hence improving the visible light utilization and photocatalytic activity. Further investigation demonstrated that 1 O 2 was the main active species. Moreover, the SMX degradation mechanism and pathway were proposed. In a word, this study proposes a gentle and efficient method to activate PI and an easy approach to prepare a single-atom Ag photocatalyst.					lai, bo/E-4893-2013														1385-8947	1873-3212				JAN 15	2025	504								158796	10.1016/j.cej.2024.158796	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.158796		DEC 2024											WOS:001401384100001

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing to provide valuable insights and identify potential bacterial species and metabolite roles involved in kidney stone formation. The overall gut bacterial community and its potential functions in healthy participants and patients were examined using PacBio sequencing targeting the full-length 16S rRNA gene, coupled with stone and statistical analyses. Most kidney stones comprised calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate (75%), pure calcium oxalate (20%), and calcium phosphate and magnesium phosphate (5%), with higher content of Ca (130,510.5 +/- 108,362.7 ppm) followed by P (18,746.4 +/- 23,341.2 ppm). The microbial community structure was found to be weaker in patients' kidney stone samples, followed by patients' stool samples, than in healthy participants' stool samples. The most abundant bacterial species in kidney stone samples was uncultured Morganella, whereas that in patient and healthy participant stool samples was Bacteroides vulgatus. Similarly, Akkermansia muciniphila was significantly enriched in patient stool samples at the species level, whereas Bacteroides plebeius was significantly enriched in kidney stone samples than that in healthy participant stool samples. Three microbial metabolic pathways, TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and urea cycle, were significantly enriched in kidney stone patients compared to healthy participants. Inferring bacteria at the species level revealed key players in kidney stone formation, enhancing the clinical relevance of gut microbiota.

Sixty newborn piglets with an average initial body weight (BW) of 1.51 +/- 0.05 kg were assigned to a control (CON) group and an LF group. At age 1 to 7 days, the piglets in the LF group were orally administered LF solution (0.5 g per kg BW daily), whereas the piglets in the CON group were orally administered the same dose of physiological saline. Plasma, jejunum and liver samples were collected on days 8 and 21. The LF piglets showed a decreased plasma urea nitrogen level on day 8 and an increased plasma albumin level on day 21. Pathway analysis of the metabolomic profiles showed that the LF treatment affected amino acid metabolism in the liver. In addition, the LF treatment upregulated the gene expression levels of proteolytic enzymes and amino acid transporters (APA, APN, EAAC1, Pept1, CAT1, B0AT1 and ASCT2) in the jejunum, and it enhanced the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and p70S6K in the liver. The LF treatment also upregulated the expression of a beta-oxidation-related gene (CPT1) and affected the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the liver on day 21. Furthermore, the LF piglets showed a decreased level of malondialdehyde and increased levels of GSH, GSH-Px and GCLC in the liver mitochondria. Overall, the early-life LF intervention affected the protein synthesis, energy production and antioxidative capacity in the liver of the neonatal piglets.

However, the suitability and metabolic consequences of using Scenedesmus as an animal feed ingredient have not been examined in detail. In this study, the influences of consuming Scenedesmus on the metabolic status of young mice were investigated through growth performance, blood chemistry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. Compared to the control diet, feeding a diet containing 5% Scenedesmus improved growth performance while the diet containing 20% Scenedesmus suppressed it. Among common macronutrients-derived blood biochemicals, serum triacylglycerols and cholesterol levels were dramatically decreased by feeding the 20% Scenedesmus diet. Metabolomic analysis of liver, serum, feces, and urine samples indicated that Scenedesmus feeding greatly affected the metabolites associated with amino acid, lipid, purine, microbial metabolism, and the endogenous antioxidant system. The growth promotion effect of feeding the 5% Scenedesmus diet was associated with elevated concentrations of antioxidants, an expanded purine nucleotide cycle, and modified microbial metabolism, while the growth suppression effect of feeding the 20% Scenedesmus diet was correlated to oxidative stress, disrupted urea cycle, upregulated fatty acid oxidation, and an imbalanced lipidome. These correlations among Scenedesmus dietary inclusion rate, individual metabolite markers, and growth performance suggest the need to define the dietary inclusion rate threshold for using Scenedesmus and other microalgae supplements as feed ingredients, and also warrant further mechanistic investigations on the biological processes connecting specific constituents of Scenedesmus with the metabolic effects observed in this study.
