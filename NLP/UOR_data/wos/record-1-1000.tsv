J	Xu, W; Wu, ZC; Tao, SW				Xu, Wei; Wu, Zucheng; Tao, Shanwen			Urea-Based Fuel Cells and Electrocatalysts for Urea Oxidation	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY												Urea is a new member of hydrogen-storage materials for low-temperature fuel cells. It avoids issues of toxicity and safety compared to NH3 and hydrazine. The main limitation of urea-based fuel cells is their relatively low power densities due to the sluggish anode reactions. Rapid advances in nanocatalysts used for urea electro-oxidation have been achieved in lowering overpotential and improving activity. Urine, as a natural resource of urea, is also an environmental pollutant. Most technologies of treating urine with self-generation electricity are based on microbial fuel cells. However, microbes are only able to utilize the organic substrates rather than urea in urine. Chemical fuel cells in contrast directly oxidize urea to nitrogen gas, removing it from urine. Thus, urea-based fuel cells have been used as an alternative method to treat urine. In this Minireview, the progress in urea-based fuel cells and electrocatalysts for urea oxidation is reviewed.

Urea sources are abundant from human urine, urea-containing wastewater, and industrial urea, thus becoming an attractive option as anodic fuel for the application in direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs). Besides, as a hydrogen-rich chemical fuel, urea can also be electrolyzed to produce hydrogen for energy storage in the near future. The exact mechanisms of urea decomposition are pretty different in alkaline or neutral mediums and are separately discussed in detail. More importantly, the development of anodic electro-catalysts is of great significance for improving the electrochemical performance of both DUFCs and urea electrolysis cells, which is systematically summarized in our review. Challenges and prospects on the future development of urea electro-oxidation are particularly proposed.

Herein, self-supported electrodes consisting of NiO nanosheets vertically grown on CuO nanowires are synthesized to realize the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Such electrodes show excellent UOR performance requiring 1.39 V vs. RHE to achieve 100 mA/cm2. Besides, DUFCs provide open circuit voltages and power densities up to 0.88 V and 11.35 mW/cm2. Electrochemical characterization and Raman spectroscopy prove the formation of NiOOH to enable the UOR. Mott-Schottky analysis and UV photoelectron spectroscopy show the NiO/CuO p-p heterostructure to facilitate the charge transfer from CuO nanowires to NiO nanosheets. Besides, at a local level, density functional theory calculations show that the presence of CuO modulates the electronic states of Ni at the very NiOOH/CuO interface, which results in stretched Ni-O bonds and a uniquely elongated N-H bond of urea that favors its oxidation.

Here we demonstrated that nickel-molybdenum oxide nanorods were efficient catalysts for urea electro-oxidation. Nickel-molybdenum oxide nanorods were prepared with various Ni/Mo molar ratios in the precursors and the crystal structure, morphology and surface elements compositions of the nickel-molybdenum oxide nanorods were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalytic performance of urea oxidation and kinetics analysis were measured by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; the process of urea catalyzed by nickel-molybdenum oxide was proposed to follow an electrochemical-chemical reaction mechanism in which urea oxidation happened accompanying the redox of NiOOH/Ni(OH)(2) at high potentials. The catalytic ability for urea oxidation was varied by changing the ratio of Ni/Mo in the precursors, and the rapid kinetics, small charge transfer resistance and low Tafel slope consistently supported NiMoO4-C (Ni/Mo = 2) materials as the best catalyst for urea electro-oxidation. The desirable electrocatalytic activity, stability and tolerance towards urea oxidation indicated its promising applications in sustainable energy techniques and alleviating water contamination.

Here, we report defective NiFe2O4 (NFO) nanoparticles with excellent performance for urea electro-oxidation. The results show that defects can be effectively implanted at the surface of NFO nanoparticles by a facile and versatile lithium reduction method without affecting its main crystal structure and grain size. The defective NFO-5Li nanoparticles displayed a significantly improved urea electro-oxidation performance compared with NFO-Pristine nanoparticles. Particularly, the NFO-Pristine and NFO-5Li show a potential of 1.398 and 1.361 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 37.3 and 31.4 mV dec(-1), respectively. In addition, the NFO-5Li nanoparticles also revealed outstanding electrocatalytic stability. The superior performance can be attributed to the designed tunable surface defect engineering.

If environmental governance and energy supply can be combined, it will be more consistent with the long-term concept of sustainable development. Urea electrooxidation may achieve the degradation of pollutants and the conversion of energy supply, urea oxidation occurs at the anode and hydrogen evolution occurs at the cathode. However, the electrochemical oxidation process of urea requires the transfer of six electrons, and the reaction rate is slow. The electrocatalyst is a key factor in improving the reaction kinetics. In this context, catalysts used in urea electrocatalytic oxidation in recent years are reviewed in this paper. The application of the electrocatalyst in electrolytic hydrogen production, urea wastewater treatment, urea fuel cells and urea sensors are described in detail.

F.			Light-driven urea oxidation for a wearable artificial kidney	CATALYSIS TODAY												For the development of a wearable artificial kidney (WAK) that uses a small dialysate volume that is continuously regenerated, it is essential that urea, one of the main uremic retention solutes, is removed. Despite advances in sorbent technology or electro-oxidation no safe, efficient and selective method for urea removal has been re-ported that allows miniaturization of the artificial kidney to wearable proportions. Here we have developed a flow cell for light-driven, photo-electrocatalytic (PEC) urea removal for use in a WAK. We use a photo-active material (hematite) coated with a catalyst (NiOOH) as working electrode for selective urea oxidation and a silver-chloride (AgCl) cathode. The use of the AgCl counter electrodes eliminates the need for an external bias voltage, and allows operation under light illumination only. Using LED illumination (460 nm) we show that urea is selectively oxidized over chloride. N-2 formation is confirmed by gas-phase analysis of the headspace of the sample vial, using mass spectrometry. Other nitrogen containing products include nitrite but importantly ammonia and nitrate are not detected. Using the PEC concept a urea removal rate of 2.5 mu mol/cm(2)h (or 0.15 mg/ cm(2)h) has been achieved. Extrapolating our results to an upscaled system, a surface area of 0.5 m(2) would enable efficient removal of the daily produced amount of urea (similar to 300 mmol) urea within 24 h, when driven by LED illumination only.

The mesostructure of NiPO-a is composed of less-ordered nanotubes of different lengths and NiPO-b, NiPO-c are arranged by a kind of flower-like nanosheet porous film. While, NiPO-d is composed of stacked nanocrystals. These nickel phosphates are examined by electrochemical tests to investigate the electrochemical activity of urea oxidation under alkaline conditions. Compared with commercial NiO, the four kinds of nickel phosphates have a more negative initial oxidation potential, which are more likely to react chemically with urea. As to NiPO-c, the highest oxidation current density for urea oxidation and superior stability are observed. During a 96-hour amperometric i-t test, the surface of NiPO-c modified fluorine-doped tin dioxide transparent conductive glass (FTO) electrode does not fall off, and the electrochemical activity just reduces 2.52% compared with the maximum value. NiPO-c has great potential for large-scale production in the field of urea-rich wastewater treatment and energy consumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Urea possesses 10.1 wt.% of hydrogen. Nevertheless, its electrochemical oxidation is generally sluggish and inefficient. Ni-based catalysts which showed efficient activity towards urea electrooxidation in the alkaline medium were studied for Direct Urea Fuel Cell (DUFC) anodes. In the present study, we investigated urea oxidation on a novel three-dimensional mixed oxide catalyst, NiCo2O4. Mn-doped NiCo2O4 catalyst exhibited urea oxidation activity of 45.88 mA cm(-2) (at 1.30 V vs SHE), fifteen times higher than NiO and Co3O4 and twice that of bare NiCo2O4 spinel. Chronoamperometry curves of the Mn-doped NiCo2O4 catalyst demonstrated stable urea oxidation for over 3 hours. The significantly higher mass activity of Mn-doped NiCo2O4 catalyst is attributed to the least nano-crystallite size, better dispersion of Ni nuclei onto the spinel crystal matrix, enhanced Ni electrochemical active surface area, and lower bandgap.

These technologies include electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical urea splitting for hydrogen production and direct urea fuel cells as power engines. They have demonstrated great potentials as alternatives to current water splitting and hydrogen fuel cell systems with more favorable operating conditions and cost effectiveness. At the moment, UOR performance is mainly limited by the 6-electron transfer process. In this case, various material design and synthesis strategies have recently been reported to produce highly efficient UOR catalysts. The performance of these advanced catalysts is optimized by the modification of their structural and chemical properties, including porosity development, heterostructure construction, defect engineering, surface functionalization, and electronic structure modulation. Considering the rich progress in this field, the recent advances in the design and synthesis of UOR catalysts for urea electrolysis, photoelectrochemical urea splitting, and direct urea fuel cells are reviewed here. Particular attention is paid to those design concepts, which specifically target the characteristics of urea molecules. Moreover, challenges and prospects for the future development of urea-based energy conversion technologies and corresponding catalysts are also discussed.					zou, Ruqiang/N-8803-2013; Liang, Zibin/AAI-3997-2021	Zhu, Bing Jun/0000-0001-5698-8247													1613-6810	1613-6829				FEB	2020	16	7							1906133	10.1002/smll.201906133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.201906133		JAN 2020						31913584					WOS:000506067200001

The composites are synthesized by impregnation of a graphite powder with an aqueous solution of nickel and rhodium salts, followed by drying and reduction under H-2/Ar at 500 degrees C. TEM observations reveal that the Rh fraction influences the average nanoparticle size which varies from 15 nm for pure Ni to 2 nm for pure Rh. XRD analysis indicates that solid solutions are obtained for all compositions. Ni100-xRhx with up to 30 at.% of rhodium have a higher electrocatalytic activity than pure Ni and their voltammograms exhibit two urea oxidation peaks rather than one, the additional peak being at a potential 50 mV less positive than that of pure nickel. When the rhodium content increases above 30 at.%, the current of urea oxidation decreases and becomes almost zero for pure rhodium. These variations in current as the fraction of rhodium increases are only related to the decrease in nanoparticle size and in nickel content (within a surface layer of similar to 1 nm). Hence, there is no synergistic effect between nickel and rhodium for the oxidation of urea in alkaline media. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Nyquist plots show semicircles with fitting parameters that are dependent on the applied conditions. Charge transfer resistance is found to be lower in presence of urea due to higher rates of urea electrooxidation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) helps to investigate the catalytic properties of urea oxidation on the GC/NiOx. The relation between the peak current of urea oxidation and the potential scan rate are measured and fitted with that calculated by Randles-Sevcik equation. The results indicate a diffusion-controlled irreversible process. Optimization of the loading extent of NiOx and interpretation of the effect of urea concentration is enabled from the CVs, EIS and equivalent circuit parameters.					; Saleh, Mahmoud/P-5869-2016	Tammam, Reham/0000-0003-4985-4616; Saleh, Mahmoud/0000-0001-8660-4638													1572-6657	1873-2569				JUN 1	2017	794						189	196		10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.04.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.04.023													WOS:000403128200026
J	Wu, TH; Lin, YC; Hou, BW; Liang, WY				Wu, Tzu-Ho; Lin, Yan-Cheng; Hou, Bo-Wei; Liang, Wei-Yuan			Nanostructured β-NiS Catalyst for Enhanced and Stable Electro-oxidation of Urea	CATALYSTS												Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has received a high level of recent interest since electrochemical oxidation of urea can remediate harmful nitrogen compounds in wastewater and accomplish hydrogen fuel production simultaneously. Thus, urea is considered to be potential hydrogen energy source that is inherently safe for fuel cell applications. However, the catalytic reaction suffers from slow kinetics due to six electron transfer in UOR. In this work, beta phase NiS is successfully prepared through facile hydrothermal reaction, in which diethanolamine (DEA) was added as chelating agent leading to 3D nanoflower morphology. The crystal structure, surface morphology, and chemical bonding of the beta-NiS were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The UOR performance of NiS was evaluated by means of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), chronoamperometry, and chronopotentiometry in 1 M KOH electrolyte containing 0.33 M urea. Compared to the Ni(OH)(2) counterpart, NiS exhibits lower onset potential, increased current responses, faster kinetics of urea oxidation, lower charge transfer resistance, and higher urea diffusion coefficient, leading to the enhanced catalytic performance toward UOR. Moreover, the developed NiS catalyst exhibits superior stability and tolerance towards urea electro-oxidation in 10,000 s test.

In this work, the electrochemical oxidation of urea on a Ni/Sn dendrites catalyst is investigated. Ni and Ni/Sn dendrites are synthesized through electrodeposition on porous Toray(C) carbon paper. The prepared catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. The Ni/Sn dendrites oxidized 0.33 M urea in alkaline solution at an onset potential of 0.34 V vs. Ag/AgCl with a current density of 44 mAcm(-2)@0.55 V, which is higher than that of electrodeposited Ni/TC (31 mAcm(-2)@0.55 V). In situ Raman spectroscopic measurements indicate that urea oxidation on Ni/Sn dendrites is initiated by Ni(III) OOH species. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy patterns of Ni/Sn dendrites in the presence of urea displayed a single depressed semicircle at potentials of 325 mV and two semicircles above 325 mV with a decreased total charge-transfer resistance. The Ni/Sn dendrites electrode shows lower resistance at the tested potentials, indicative of faster urea oxidation kinetics.

A direct urea-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell is a new kind of fuel cell employing urea as fuel and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant which possesses a larger cell voltage. Herein, this work tries to promote the kinetics process of urea oxi-dation by preparing low-cost and high-efficient NiCo2S4 nanowires modified carbon sponge electrode. The carbon sponge used in this work with a similar three-dimensional multi-channel structure to Ni foam, is prepared by carbonizing recycled polyurethane sponge which is also a process of recycling waste. The performance of the prepared catalyst in an alkaline solution is investigated in a three-electrode system. With the introduction of Co element to the catalyst, a reduced initial urea oxidation potential and a high performance are obtained. Furthermore, a direct urea-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell is assembled using the NiCo2S4 nanowires modified carbon sponge anode. Results indicate that the prepared catalyst provides a chance to solve the current problems that hinder the development of urea electrooxidation (high initial urea oxidation potential, low performance, and high electrode costs).

Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) plays a vital role in treating urea-rich wastewater and assisting hydrogen production with low energy consumption. To alleviate the sluggish intrinsic reaction kinetic barrier of six-electron transfer involved in UOR, we develop a NiFe ultra-thin two-dimensional nanosheet array supported on nickel foam as UOR electrocatalyst by one-step hydrothermal method. Benefiting from the in-situ synthesis strategy, abundant mesoporous structure, and the electronic structure change of Ni after the introduction of Fe, NiFe nanosheets (NiFe NSs) exhibit remarkable UOR catalytic activity and excellent long-term stability. Moreover, we assemble a two-electrode electrolytic cell with NiFe NSs/ NF as the anode. The results show that the cell voltage of urea assisted water electrolysis for hydrogen production decreased by 15.2% rather than the regular water splitting, as well as that the urea concentration in electrolyte is degraded 55.6% after electrolysis for 36 h at 1.70 V. This work indicates a feasibility verification for the electrocatalytic removal of urea in wastewater treatment, and an efficient and energy-saving method for ureaassisted electrolytic hydrogen production based on NiFe nanosheets.

Stable electrochemical urea oxidation on Ruddlesden-Popper oxide catalysts	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY												Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a crucial process for the efficiency of urea-based energy conversion technologies, including electrocatalytic water splitting and urea fuel cells. These technologies are considered alternatives to the traditional hydrogen production methods due to lower overpotentials and higher cost-effectiveness. However, sluggish UOR kinetics currently limit the practical applications of these technologies. In this study, we investigated the influence of electrolyte composition and temperature on the performance of Ruddlesden-Popper complex oxides in UOR. Our findings demonstrate that the formation of a carbonate layer at the electrode surface is a critical factor limiting UOR kinetics. This layer is mainly composed of carbonates of alkali metal from the solution and can be eliminated at elevated temperatures due to increased solubility. Specifically, we found that LaSrNi0.5Co0.5O4 +/-delta catalyst exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity (6 mA cm-2 at 1.45 V vs. RHE with loading 100 mu g cm-2) operating at 60 degrees C in 5 M KOH. Moreover, changing the solution to cesium hydroxide, we were able to avoid the creation of a non-conductive layer due to higher solubility of the cesium carbonate, thus stabilizing the catalytic reaction.

Uncovering the role of vanadium doped Ni2P for low concentration urea oxidation	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Nickel-based electrocatalysts are promising candidates for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). However, they also catalyze the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This competition makes electrocatalytic urea oxidation more energy-consuming, especially in electrolytes with low urea concentrations that resemble the urea levels in actual wastewater samples. Herein, V5+ is incorporated into the 3D structure of inter-connected nickel phosphide nanosheets grown on the surface of nickel foam (denoted as V-doped Ni2P/NF) to enhance the affinity of the nickel phosphide electrocatalyst for urea molecules. In situ Raman and DFT disclosed that vanadium serves as an adsorption site, bringing urea molecules close to the electrode surface. Moreover, upon the addition of vanadium, the rate-determining step (RDS) of the urea oxidation reaction changes from the N2 desorption step to the first deprotonation with a lower energy barrier (2.62 eV to 2.03 eV, respectively). The synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance with a low onset potential and long-term durability toward UOR. Additionally, in a low urea concentration electrolyte, the V-doped Ni2P/NF demonstrates excellent selectivity for UOR over OER at all applied potentials. Compared to Ni2P/NF, the V-doped Ni2P/NF shows a 40 % reduction in energy consumption for complete decomposition of urea in a low urea concentration environment.

However, it is limited by sluggish reaction kinetics, especially by CO2 desorption steps, masking its energetic advantage compared with water oxidation. Now, a lattice-oxygen-involved UOR mechanism on Ni4+ active sites is reported that has significantly faster reaction kinetics than the conventional UOR mechanisms. Combined DFT, O-18 isotope-labeling mass spectrometry, and in situ IR spectroscopy show that lattice oxygen is directly involved in transforming *CO to CO2 and accelerating the UOR rate. The resultant Ni4+ catalyst on a glassy carbon electrode exhibits a high current density (264 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V versus RHE), outperforming the state-of-the-art catalysts, and the turnover frequency of Ni4+ active sites towards UOR is 5 times higher than that of Ni3+ active sites.

Thus, achieving sustainable urea production under ambient conditions and the potential to recycle urea from wastewater represent significant eco-economic advancements. In this study, a novel Ni-confined In2O3 (Ni-In2O3) electrocatalyst demonstrating outstanding capabilities in both the urea evolution reaction (UER) from nitrate and carbon dioxide and the highly efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for waste urea utilization is introduced. Computational data and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis demonstrate that the unique Ni-oxygen vacancy (Ni-Vo) local structure effectively modulates the electronic configuration of neighboring In and Ni atoms. This structural refinement results in a significantly reduced energy barrier for the potential-determining steps (PDS) in both UER (*COOHNH2 -> *CONH2) and UOR (*CO(NH2)(2) -> *CONHNH2). Consequently, the optimized catalysts achieve a urea evolution faradic efficiency of 19.6%, accompanied by remarkable UOR performance, attaining a 100 mA cm(-2) anodic current density at a potential of 1.35 V. This work not only offers a sustainable route to urea production but also highlights the potential for efficient urea oxidation, contributing to a greener and more economically viable future for the nitrogen cycle.

In this study, a crystalline NiSe2/amorphous NiFe-LDH (NiSe2/NiFe-LDH) heterojunction catalyst is rationally constructed for selective electrocatalytic UOR. In situ Raman spectra and ex situ characterization results reveal that such a structure can tailor the self-oxidation of catalyst and impede the accumulation of NiOOH species during the UOR process. Density function theory simulations disclose that the self-driven charge transport from electron-deficient NiFe-LDH region to electron-rich NiSe2 region would induce the formation of local electrophilic/nucleophilic region to adsorb the electron-donating -NH2 and electron-withdrawing C = O groups, respectively. This optimizes the adsorption of urea molecules and hinders the overaccumulation of OH- ions on the surface of NiSe2/NiFe-LDH, which is beneficial for the priority occurrence of UOR over the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the realization of high UOR selectivity. Benefiting from the tailored surface self-oxidation and favorable urea adsorption, the NiSe2/NiFe-LDH could act as a high-selective UOR anode and achieve ultrahigh 800 mAcm-2 only at 1.447 V. Besides, UV-vis spectrophotometry also unveiled that the NiSe2/NiFe-LDH has the capability to electrochemically degrade urea, offering great promise for practical application potentials.

J	Tran, MH; Park, BJ; Kim, BH; Yoon, HH				Manh Hoang Tran; Park, Bang Ju; Kim, Bo Hyeon; Yoon, Hyon Hee			Mesoporous silica template-derived nickel-cobalt bimetallic catalyst for urea oxidation and its application in a direct urea/H2O2 fuel cell	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Ni-based catalysts are considered as an efficient anode material for urea fuel cells due to the low cost and high activity in alkaline media. Herein, we demonstrate that Ni-Co bimetallic hydroxide particles with highly porous nanostructures can be synthesized using mesoporous silica nanoparticles as templates. The replicated nanostructures of the Ni-Co hydroxide samples from the mesoporous silica templates are observed. The porous Ni0.8Co0.2(OH)(2) particles exhibited considerably enhanced electro-catalytic activity for urea oxidation reaction by providing a high surface area and fast mass transport for urea oxidation reaction. It is also found that the Co-doping at 20% significantly reduce the overpotential and increase the peak current of urea oxidation reaction. A direct urea/H2O2 fuel cell with the porous Ni0.8Co0.2(OH)(2) as anode material shows an excellent performance with maximum power densities of 11.2 and 25.6 mW cm(-2) at 20 degrees C and 70 degrees C with 0.5 M urea in 5 M KOH, respectively. Thus, this work suggests that the highly porous Ni0.8Co0.2(OH)(2)-derived from the mesoporous silica templates can be used for urea oxidation and as an efficient anode material for urea-based fuel cells.

In this work, nickel cobalt phosphate (NiCoPO) with different Ni/Co ratio are successfully fabricated by co-precipitation method. The electronic states and texture properties of the active Ni(III) species can be regulated by the introduced Co phosphate. The cobalt introduction effectively reduced the onset potential and increased the oxidation current. Compared with nickel phosphate (NiPO), the onset potential of NiCoPO (4:6) and NiCoPO (6:4) decreased by 135 and 132 mV in urea and methanol electro-oxidation process, respectively. The amperometric i-t curves show that the current densities of NiCoPO electrodes are significantly higher than that of NiPO and CoPO. The NiCoPO (4:6) and (5:5) exhibits the highest current of urea and methanol oxidation, respectively.

J	Wu, N; Du, XQ				Wu, Na; Du, Xiaoqiang			Controlled synthesis of N-CuCo2S4@Ni3S2 nanoarrays as promising urea oxidation electrocatalyst	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												One of the most attractive means for mitigation of environmental pollution is to produce hydrogen by electrocatalytic urea splitting. In the paper, the heterogeneous interfacial rich N-CuCo2S4@Ni3S2 material was in situ synthesized on nickel foam through a typical hydrothermal and sulfuration process. This N-CuCo2S4@Ni3S2 electrode displays excellent urea oxidation performance (potential of 1.38 V@50 mA cm-2), which is one of the best reactivity reported so far. Experimental results show that the superior catalytic activity is attributed to the rapid charge transfer, more reaction center exposed and superior electrical conductivity. Density functional theory shows that this Ni3S2 material accelerates the reaction rate in the catalytic process, the introduction of this N-CuCo2S4 material improves the conductivity of the material, and the synergistic catalysis of the N-CuCo2S4 and Ni3S2 makes this N-CuCo2S4@Ni3S2 material exhibit superior urea oxidation activity. Notably, long-term tests have shown a decrease in catalytic activity, which suggests that the surface of the sulfide is in situ generated to oxides or hydroxides, which are truly active species. This work provides a new idea for the development of efficient and stable urea oxidation catalysts for sulfides. & COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nanosheets of CuCo2O4 As a High-Performance Electrocatalyst in Urea Oxidation	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a possible solution to solve the world's energy crisis. Fuel cells have been used in the UOR to generate hydrogen with a lower potential compared to water splitting, decreasing the costs of energy production. Urea is abundantly present in agricultural waste and in industrial and human wastewater. Besides generating hydrogen, this reaction provides a pathway to eliminate urea, which is a hazard in the environment and to people's health. In this study, nanosheets of CuCo2O4 grown on nickel foam were synthesized as an electrocatalyst for urea oxidation to generate hydrogen as a green fuel. The synthesized electrocatalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electroactivity of CuCo2O4 towards the oxidation of urea in alkaline solution was evaluated using electrochemical measurements. Nanosheets of CuCo2O4 grown on nickel foam required the potential of 1.36 V in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The CuCo2O4 electrode was electrochemically stable for over 15 h of continuous measurements. The high catalytic activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction make the CuCo2O4 electrode a bifunctional catalyst and a promising electroactive material for hydrogen production. The two-electrode electrolyzer demanded a potential of 1.45 V, which was 260 mV less than that for the urea-free counterpart. Our study suggests that the CuCo2O4 electrode can be a promising material as an efficient UOR catalyst for fuel cells to generate hydrogen at a low cost.

However, the performance of UOR is limited by the dynamic complex of the six-electron transfer process. To this end, it is essential to develop efficient UOR catalysts. Nickel-based materials have been extensively investigated owing to their high activity, easy modification, stable properties, and cheap and abundant reserves. Various material designs and strategies have been investigated in producing highly efficient UOR catalysts including alloying, doping, heterostructure construction, defect engineering, micro functionalization, conductivity modulation, etc. It is essential to promptly review the progress in this field to significantly inspire subsequent studies. In this review, we summarized a comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms of oxidation or poisoning and UOR processes on nickel-based catalysts as well as different approaches to prepare highly active catalysts. Moreover, challenges and prospects for future developments associated with issues of UOR in urea-based energy conversion applications were also discussed.																				2073-4344				MAR	2022	12	3							337	10.3390/catal12030337	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/catal12030337													WOS:000775757200001

However, developing an efficient and stable electrocatalyst is necessary to overcome the indolent kinetics of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Accordingly, we have used the Schikorr reaction to deposit Fe3O4 particles on the nickel foam (Fe3O4/NF). Results from the various analysis indicated that under the operational conditions, Fe3O4 underwent surface reconstruction to produce a heterolayered structure wherein a catalytically active FeOOH layer encased a conducting Fe3O4. Fe3O4/NF outperformed RuO2 as a UOR catalyst and delivered a current density of 10 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) at low applied potentials of 1.38 1.42 and 1.46 V, respectively, with a Tafel slope of 28 mV dec(-1). At the applied potential of 1.4 V, Fe3O4/NF demonstrated a turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.8 x 10(3) s(-1), highlighting its superior intrinsic activity. In addition, a symmetrical urea electrolyzer constructed using Fe3O4/NF produced the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.54 V. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The structural and morphological properties of the LNF-C/MWCNT nanocomposite were studied by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The Ni-based pervoskite exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity than a single NiO compound, and CeO2 further improved the activity and stability. The reaction of urea electrooxidation on LNF-C occurred via 6-electrons, and was a half-order reaction with respect to urea concentrations in alkaline solution, as observed by cyclic voltammetry studies. The LNF-C/MWCNT modified electrodes exhibited a sensitivity of 195.6 mu AmM-1 cm(-2) in a linear range from 25 to 670 mu M of urea with a low detection limit (1 mu M), fast response time (5 s), and good stability. In addition, the urea sensor demonstrated feasibility for urea analysis in real urine samples. The results indicated that the LNF-C/MWCNT composite could be used as an effient catalyst for the electro-oxidation of urea and electrode material for non-enzymatic urea sensors.

However, conventional Ni-based catalysts could easily overoxidize urea into the secondary contaminant NOx-, and enhancing the innocuity of urea electrolysis remains a grand challenge to be achieved. Herein, we tailored the electrode-electrolyte interface of an unconventional cation effect on the anodic oxidation of urea to regulate its activity and selectivity. Smaller cations of Li+ were discovered to increase the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the innocuous N-2 product from the standard value of similar to 15 % to 45 %, while decreasing the FEs of the over-oxidized NOx- product from similar to 80 % to 46 %, pointing to a more sustainable process. The kinetic and computational analysis revealed the dominant residence of cations on the outer Helmholtz layer, which forms the interactions with the surface adsorbates. The Li+ hydration shells and rigid hydrogen bonding network interact strongly with the adsorbed urea to decrease its adsorption energy and subjection to C-N cleavage, thereby directing it toward the N-2 pathway. This work emphasizes the tuning of the interactions within the electrode-electrolyte interface for enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of electrocatalytic processes.					wang, yongjie/HJB-4285-2022; Wang, Hua-Ling/ABG-8672-2021; xu, shengshuo/GXG-4356-2022	Yizhou, Yang/0000-0001-5080-5024													1864-5631	1864-564X				DEC 19	2023	16	24							e202300766	10.1002/cssc.202300766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202300766		OCT 2023						37602526					WOS:001080987900001

The effects of polarization potential and KOH concentration on the impedance appearance are investigated. In the presence of urea, it is found that Nyquist plots exhibit two depressed semicircles, with one at higher frequencies stably locating in the first quadrant while the other's location at lower frequencies varying between the first and second quadrant as the polarization potential changes. Results show both indirect and direct pathways proceed in urea electro-oxidation reaction. A mathematical model indicates the reverse loop in the Nyquist plots is attributed to CO2 poisoning on the catalyst, which is also validated by the followed chronoamperometric method. Moreover, the rate determining steps of urea electro-oxidation reaction is dependent on KOH concentration. The EIS technique gives a new sight to interpret the poor stability of urea electro-oxidation on nickel catalyst, and thus helps to explore a CO2-insensitive catalyst. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The present work focuses on the synthesis of nickel cobaltite using mixed metal oxalates via the micellar route. Microscopic studies of NiCo2O4 confirm the formation of selfassembled ultrafine nanoparticles of size -6 nm which were hierarchically arranged to form the microflower structure. Similarly, sodium hydroxide is used as a precipitating agent, and NiCo2O4 with discrete nanoparticles of the size -15 nm is formed. The obtained NiCo2O4 microflowers and nanoparticles were used for electrochemical water and urea oxidation in alkaline media. The water oxidation of 3D microflowers shows an overpotential of 300 mV and -206 mV for O2 and H2 evolution whereas nanoparticles show 620 mV and -429 mV overpotential in 1 M KOH, respectively. Further, electrochemical urea oxidation for NiCo2O4 microflowers requires 1.27 V to achieve 10 mA/cm2 current density whereas nanoparticles are inactive towards urea oxidation in 3 M KOH. The overall study suggests that oxalate route synthesis results in hierarchically arranged nanoparticle growth to 3D microflower structure and NiCo2O4 microflower serves as a promising candidate for water and urea electrolysis in alkaline media compared to NiCo2O4 nanoparticle.

Synthesis and performance of PdAu/ITO electrocatalysts in urea oxidation reaction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE												PdAu electrocatalysts were prepared in different atomic compositions supported on ITO by sodium Borohydride process. XRD results show intense crystalline peaks related to ITO, which may mask the appearance of less crystalline Pd or Au phases. Transmission results indicate agglomeration of palladium and gold nanoparticles on the support, a phenomenon compatible with metal oxide supports. Cyclic voltammograms in the absence of urea display characteristics commonly observed for PdAu electrodes, with an increase in oxygenated species compared to pure Pd or Au. Voltammograms in the presence of urea showed oxidation processes and lower current values, indicating catalyst deactivation processes. PdAu 75:25 demonstrated higher power density values compared to other prepared electrocatalysts, suggesting a synergy between Pd and Au for urea oxidation reaction.																			1452-3981					OCT	2024	19	10							100810	10.1016/j.ijoes.2024.100810	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoes.2024.100810		OCT 2024											WOS:001368645400001
J	Gao, W; Wang, C; Ma, FY; Wen, D				Gao, Wei; Wang, Chen; Ma, Fangyuan; Wen, Dan			Highly active electrocatalysts of CeO2 modified NiMoO4 nanosheet arrays towards water and urea oxidation reactions	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												Efficient anodic electrocatalysts are of great importance for the water and urea electrolysis to lower the overall potential for hydrogen generation. NiMoO4 is recently considered as a promising electrocatalyst towards water and urea oxidation reactions while its catalytic properties are still not comparable to the state-of-the-art catalysts. Herein, decorating CeO2 nanoparticles on NiMoO4 nanosheets is proposed and realized by the facile post-annealing treatment of NiMoO4 with absorbed Ce3+ ions. Due to the strong interaction between CeO2 and NiMoO4, the surface chemical states are modulated with more defects as catalytic sites. By optimizing the ratio of CeO2 to NiMoO4, the obtained catalyst of CeO2 modified NiMoO4 exhibited significantly enhanced activity with lower overpotentials and remarkable durability as compared with NiMoO4 for water and urea oxidation. Therefore, this facile method of post decorating CeO2 nanoparticles promoted the activity of NiMoO4, contributing to the robust anodes for low-cost and stable hydrogen generation.

Electrochemical catalytic oxidation of urea has emerged as an efficient approach to solve this problem. Nevertheless, the current nickel-based catalysts (e.g., nickel hydroxide/sulfides) feature a high metal content. It not only lowers the utilization efficiency of nickel but also causes secondary pollution to the environment. Here, nickel-doped carbon dots (Ni-CDs) with an excellent and stable catalytic activity for the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are reported. Specifically, carbon dots (CDs) with abundant functional groups are synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal method and then Ni-CDs with a very low metal content (1.1 at%) are prepared. The Ni2+ sites by coordination with carboxylic groups on the CDs provide excellent electrocatalytic activity and excellent durability for the UOR, as demonstrated by an anodic current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.38 V (vs RHE) and similar experimental results in practical application. To the best of knowledge, this is the first report of CDs-based materials applied for the UOR, which opens an important new area of applicability for CDs as well as broadens the scope of the materials for electrochemical catalysis of urea.

The morphology of the NiO nanowalls are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the phase structure of NiO nanowalls is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The results indicate that the NiO nanowalls are uniformly distributed on the entire nickel foam framework. And ammonia fluoride has significant influence on the height and thickness of NiO nanowalls. With the presence of ammonia fluoride, NiO nanowalls with height of 4.6 (+/- 0.4) mu m and thickness around 50 nm were obtained, while the height and thickness decreased to 1.7 (+/- 0.2) mu m and around 20 nm without the presence of ammonia fluoride. The NiO nanowalls were used as electrodes for urea oxidation in alkaline condition. The electro-oxidation activity the catalyst is investigated by cyclic voltammetry and potential step chronoamperometry. The electrocatalytic performance of NiO electrodes depends strongly on the sample preparation condition. The 3D NiO nanowalls electrode exhibit excellent electro-oxidation activity towards urea oxidation. The morphology of the electrodes has significant influence on their activity. The current density of 3D NiO nanowalls electrode prepared with NH4F at 0.7 V reached 800 mA cm(-2), which was over 4 times than that of sample prepared without NH4F. Moreover, NiO nanowalls prepared with NH4F was more stable than the one prepared without NH4F, which did not show any appreciable morphology change after being used for urea electro-oxidation for 12 h. While the one prepared without NH4F collapsed after used.

Herein, we demonstrated an easy freeze-drying/annealing approach induced phase structure tuning of graphene supported Ni-NiO nanoparticles system for efficiently boosting urea oxidation performance. The annealing temperature was found significant to influence the Ni precursors decomposition, crystal structure formation and catalytic performance for urea oxidation. By increasing the temperature from 350 degrees C to 550 degrees C, more metallic Ni was formed in the Ni-NiO system, and because of the efficient Ni-NiO synergistic effect and conductivity improvement, the sample obtained at 450 degrees C exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability for urea oxidation. Specifically, the current density at 0.5 V was 38.24 mA cm(-2), about 5.6 and 30 times of the control sample of graphene supported NiO and Ni respectively. Efficient kinetics and rapid charge transfer-ability were also found for urea oxidation by a series of electro-kinetics analysis. The current work showed an easy way for Ni-based catalyst structure tuning with enhanced kinetics for urea oxidation, which is helpful for the sustainable utilization of urea molecular in electrochemical energy.

Hence, a carbon-encapsulated Co3V decorated Co2VO4 nanosheets catalyst (Co3V@C/Co2VO4) is synthesized to accelerate urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It displays low potentials of 1.31 V and - 51 mV to drive +/- 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M urea solution for UOR and HER, respectively. Impressively, for urea-assisted water splitting, only 1.37 V is needed to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), and it can maintain at 100 mA cm(-2) for 100 h without significant activity decay. The good performance is attributed to the heterojunction between alloy and metal oxide, as well as the carbon-encapsulating and distinctive nanosheets structure. This study provides a novel choice for developing low cost and high-performance bifunctional catalysts to deal with urea-contained wastewater and produce hydrogen. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The characterization techniques proved that Cu3.8Ni alloy NPs-anchored carbon NFs were successfully fabricated. Urea oxidation (UO) processes as a source of hydrogen and electrical energy were investigated using the fabricated composite NFs. The corresponding onset potential of UO and the oxidation current density (OCD) were measured via cyclic voltammetry as 380 mV versus Ag/AgCl electrode and 98 mA/cm(2), respectively. Kinetic study indicated that the electrochemical oxidation of urea followed the diffusion controlled process and the reaction order is 0.5 with respect to urea concentration.

Role of Ce in water oxidation reaction and urea oxidation reaction of N-Ni3S2	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												Hydrogen production by electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most promising ways to solve energy crisis and environmental pollution. In this work, we investigated the effect of Ce element on the catalytic activity of water oxidation and urea oxidation. Taking the N-Ni(3)S(2 )as an example, the N-Ce-Ni(3)S(2 )and N-Ni3S2 @Ce(OH)(3) were firstly synthesized by doping Ce element into N-Ni(3)S(2 )and constructing the interface of N-Ni(3)S(2 )and Ce(OH)(3). This N-Ni3S2 @Ce(OH)(3) exhibits enhanced catalytic activity through the con-struction of heterogeneous interfaces, whether water oxidation (overpotential of 360 mV @ 50 mA cm(-2)) or urea oxidation (1.37 V @ 100 mA cm-2). A series of experiments show that the construction of hetero-geneous interface greatly enhances the electron transfer rate of the N-Ni3S2 @Ce(OH)3 material, promotes the exposure of more active sites and improves the conductivity of the material. The density functional theory calculation also provides the water adsorption energy of the N-Ni3S2 , N-Ce-Ni(3)S(2 )and N-Ni3S2 @Ce (OH)3 materials, and it is found that the N-Ni3S2 @Ce(OH)(3 )materials give optimal water adsorption energy compared with the N-Ni(3)S(2 )intrinsic materials. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show that the main reasons for the increase in activity are exposure of more active sites and higher electron transfer rate rather than stronger water adsorption energy.

However, it is still a big challenge facing to the semiconductor-catalyst photoanode with high utilization of sunlight. Herein, we report a series of La-Ni-based Ruddlesden-Popper phases perovskite materials (Lan+1NinO3n+1, n = 1, 2 and 3) for photoelectrocatalytic oxidations of urea. Such La-Ni -based perovskite materials act simultaneously as a light-harvesting semiconductor and as the electrocatalyst for urea oxidation and all of Lan+1NinO3n+1 catalysts display a strong near-infrared (NIR) light absorption (>= 800 nm). The La4Ni3O10 catalyst exhibits the best activity towards urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with an applied potential of 1.54 V vs. RHE at 1 mA cm-2, compared to that of 1.64 V and 1.56 V vs. RHE for La2NiO4 and La3Ni2O7, respectively, and 44.7 mu mol cm-2h-1 of N2 generation rate under NIR light irradiation at the potential of 1.62 V vs. RHE, which is 2.5 times and 1.8 times of that for La2NiO4 and La3Ni2O7, respectively. The unique structure of La4Ni3O10 accelerates the separation and transport of electrons and holes, which is beneficial for the diffusion and adsorption of urea molecules in photoanode.

Herein, we unveil the phase-dependent reactivity of nickel molybdates (NiMoO4) for the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Various NiMoO4 phases, namely, alpha-NiMoO4, beta-NiMoO4, and the hydrate NiMoO4 center dot xH(2)O, were synthesized, and their structural characteristics and electrochemical properties were related to their electrocatalytic performance for the UOR. The NiMoO4 phase was found to determine its reactivity, and phase-dependent UOR activities were observed. In particular, beta-NiMoO4 exhibited a higher activity and faster kinetics than NiMoO4 center dot xH(2)O and alpha-NiMoO4, which was attributed to the large electrochemical surface area, low Tafel slope, and small charge-transfer resistance of beta-NiMoO4. Moreover, hydrogen generation via beta-NiMoO4-catalyzed urea electrolysis achieved a much lower cell voltage (1.498 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2)) than that required for water electrolysis (1.633 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2)). This work provides insights into design strategies for high-activity electrocatalysts for energy-efficient hydrogen production.

The structure and composition analysis have been performed by employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The highly ordered nanowire arrays show a strong adherence to an alloy transition layer. Herein, the alloy nanowire arrays show higher electrocatalytic activity in terms of lower onset potential and higher peak current density compared to the sample synthesized by conventional deposition route for urea electro-oxidation. Moreover, the electrocatalytic activity can be facilely optimized by selecting the length of nanowire arrays (or the deposition time). The best sample deposited with a time of 600 s possesses an onset oxidation potential of 0.372 V (vs. Hg/HgO) and a peak current density of 322.82 mAcm(-2) in 1 M KOH and 0.33 M urea solutions. The sample also shows good stability and activity even after sonication treatment. The excellent electrocatalytic properties of urea oxidation are considered due to the one-dimensional free-standing nanoscale alloy structure, which can largely boost the active sites, facilitate charge transfer, and improve the duration of urea electro-oxidation.

In this paper, different foreign ions M (M = Co, Cu and Fe) are introduced into this NiMoO4 material by hydrothermal and impregnation methods. Their electrocatalytic properties were investigated in different electrolytes, such as urea, pure water and seawater. What is noteworthy is that the Co-NiMoO4/NF electrode exhibited superior urea oxidation properties (1.32 V @ 10 mA cm-2). The different reaction mechanisms result in the superior water oxidation performance of this Fe3+-NiMoO4/NF material. What is noteworthy is that the durability of the material needs to be improved. The promoted performance is attributed to rapid electron transfer and improved electrical conductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) also shows that this Fe-NiMoO4/ NF electrode presents optimal water adsorption energy and improved electrical conductivity, thus improving the catalytic activity of the material because of introduction of Fe. The work provides novel views for the design of environmentally friendly and inexpensive multifunctional catalysts for urea, freshwater and seawater splitting reaction.																			0016-2361	1873-7153				SEP 1	2024	371		B						132050	10.1016/j.fuel.2024.132050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.132050		JUN 2024											WOS:001249508300001

Herein, a hierarchical self-standing CoNiMoOxHy/NF electrode is synthesized through a mild chemical etching and deposition process with ZIF-67 nanostructure grown on Ni foam as precursor. Electrocatalytic urea oxidation with CoNiMoOxHy/NF exhibits an outstanding activity with a quite low potential of 1.27 V (vs. RHE) at the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm -2. A low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec- 1 indicates its superior reaction kinetics. By comparing with CoNiOxHy/NF, the enhanced activity is mainly attributed to the faster generation kinetics for active NiOOH species and more accessible active sites numbers. This work may provide a meaningful reference for design of high performance UOR catalysts.

Among the various reaction con-ditions Fe-Ni3S2/NF-2 prepared at 160 degrees C for 8 h using 0.03 mM Fe(NO3)(3) shows the best results for the hydrazine and urea oxidation reactions. The potential values of 0.36, 1.39, and 1.59 V are required to achieve the current density of the 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M hydrazine (Hz), 0.33 M urea, and 1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. The onset potential in 1 M KOH, 0.33 M Urea +1 M KOH, and 1 M Hz + 1 M KOH values are 1.528, 1.306, and 0.176 respec-tively. The Fe-Ni3S2/NF-2 shows stable performance at 10 mA cm-2 until 50 h and at 60 mA cm(-2) over the 25 h. A cell of PtC//Fe-Ni3S2/NF-2 requires the potential of 0.49, 1.46, and 1.59 V for the hydrogen production in 1 M Hz + 1 M KOH, 0.33 M Urea +1 M KOH, and 1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and almost 90% stable for the hydrogen production over the 80 h in all electrolytes. The improvement of the chemical kinetics of urea and hydrazine oxidation is due to the synergistic effect of the adsorption and fast electron transfer reaction on Fe-Ni3S2/NF-2. The doped Fe ion facili-tates the fast electron transfer and the surface of Ni3S2 support to the urea and hydrazine molecule adsorption.(C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Photoelectrochemical systems have emerged as an alternative for the decentralized management of domestic wastewater with the potential of recovering energy while degrading pollutants such as urea. Tungsten oxide (WO3) has been traditionally used for water splitting, but the use of this material for the removal of waste from water coupled to hydrogen production is not deeply known until now. This contribution shows an exhaustive and systematic investigation on WO3 photoanodes for the photoelectrochemical oxidation of urea and the generation of hydrogen, with insights on the reaction mechanism, detailed nitrogen balance investigation of the process, and analysis of the performance compared to well-accepted materials. The WO3 platelets were successfully synthesized in situ on fluorine doped tin oxide glass by a hydrothermal method. The performance of WO3 was compared to titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a benchmark. The photocurrent was enhanced for both electrodes when urea was added to the electrolyte, with WO3 showing one order of magnitude higher photocurrent than TiO2. The WO3 electrode showed a peak incident photon-to-current efficiency of 43% at 360 nm and a much greater rate constant for urea oxidation (1.47 x 10-2 min-1), compared to the TiO2 photoanode (16% at 340 nm and 1.1 x 10(-3) min(-1)). The influence of different reactor configurations was also evaluated testing one- and twocompartment back-face irradiated photoelectrochemical cells. Hydrogen was generated with a Faradaic efficiency of 87.3% and a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 1.1%. These findings aim to contribute to the development of technologies based on the photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen coupled with the oxidation of pollutants in wastewater.

Looking for advanced clean energy technology to achieve sustainable development of the ecological environment has become a hot spot for researchers. Nitrogen-based substances represented by urea are environmental pollutants but ideal energy substances. The efficiency of urea-based energy conversion technology mainly depends on the choice of catalyst. The development of new catalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has important application value in the field of waste energy conversion and pollution remediation based on UOR. In this work, four metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) were synthesized using ultrasound (NiCo-UMOFs) and hydrothermal (NiCo-MOFs, Ni-MOFs and Co-MOFs) methods to testify the activity toward UOR. Materials prepared using the hydrothermal method mostly form large and unevenly stacked block structures, while material prepared using ultrasound forms a layer-by-layer two-dimensional and thinner structure. Electrochemical characterization shows NiCo-UMOFs has the best electrocatalytic performance with an onset potential of 0.32 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec-1, and a current density of 13 mA cm-2 at 0.5 V in a 1 M KOH electrolyte with 0.7 M urea.

Ni-Fe Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets Supported on Exfoliated Graphite for Efficient Urea Oxidation in Direct Urea Fuel Cells	CHEMSUSCHEM												Urea-rich wastewater can cause serious eutrophication problem to the water environment. On the other hand, urea is a potential fuel with high energy density, which can be effectively utilized by direct urea fuel cell. In this work, exfoliated graphite (EG) with high surface area and electrical conductivity was obtained by microwave irradiation, which was used to support the Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH), leading to a highly efficient and low-cost urea oxidation catalyst. Compared with commercial RuO2, the as-prepared Ni-Fe LDH/EG exhibited a lower onset potential of 1.25 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode as well as a lower Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1). The catalyst durability was also proved to be excellent. The optimized Ni/Fe molar ratio was confirmed to be 3 : 1, while the most suitable catalyst/EG ratio was 3 : 50. When applied in a dual-electrolyte direct urea fuel cell, the peak power density reached 12 mW cm(-2), and the long-term discharge was also stable with negligible voltage loss at 10 mA cm(-2) for 3 h. Such a low-cost and efficient urea oxidation catalyst can be widely utilized in future direct urea fuel cells, which achieve wastewater treatment and renewable electricity generation at the same time.

The leading electrocatalysts for the UOR are nickel hydroxide surfaces, operating by the Botte mechanism: Ni-II(OH)(2)is oxidized to (NiOOH)-O-III, and the latter drives the UOR. However, these materials have several polymorphs, with alpha- and beta-Ni(OH)(2), and gamma- and beta-NiOOH, as described by the Bode diagram. We now report a systematic study of a series of nickel hydroxides, varying gradually from alpha-rich to beta-rich materials. The crystallinity, order, hydration, intercalation, and morphology of these materials have been characterized by XRD, Raman, ATR-FTIR, XPS, and HRSEM and linked to their electrochemical activity. The disordered alpha phase was found to be superior to the beta phase as a UOR electrocatalyst, with an oxidation onset potential of 0.31 V vs. SCE, better reversibility, and higher anodic current densities. Moreover, the perfect match in onset potentials between UOR electrocatalysis and the Ni2+/Ni(3+)oxidation was observed for both phases, suggesting that the Botte mechanism is true for both the alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/gamma-NiOOH couple and the beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH couple. We further characterize the dynamic behavior of these materials (activation and aging), allowing us to propose a unified Botte-Bode diagram of UOR on Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH.

Defect engineering and heteroatoms doping are efficient routes to boost the catalytic activity. In this work, a facile thiourea corrosion strategy is employed to simultaneously generate vacancy defects and dope S in Ni-Mn hydroxides through one -pot ethanol solvothermal approach. Owing to the solubility difference between NiS and MnS in ethanol with thiourea, Mn species can be selectively etched from Ni-Mn hydroxides, and the corrosion degree of Ni-Mn hydroxides can be rationally regulated by variation of thiourea corrosion time. This corrosion strategy will change the morphology and structure of Ni-Mn hydroxides. Significantly, more vacancy defects can be created for Ni-Mn hydroxides after urea corrosion. These changes are beneficial for increasing the number of active sites, and the electronic states of Ni and Mn species can be also regulated. Hence, Ni-Mn hydroxides after thiourea corrosion delivers a much higher current density towards urea oxidation compared with Ni-Mn hydroxides without thiourea corrosion. The enhanced anti -poisoning capacity and accelerated charge transfer efficiency should be responsible for the boosted catalytic performance of Ni-Mn hydroxides with thiourea corrosion.

Herein, an amorphous nickel carbonate, a urea oxidation reaction (UOR) catalyst, was synthesized via a facile precipitation approach. The UOR catalysis on the as-synthesized amorphous nickel carbonate mainly follows the indirect chemical-oxidation path. When employed in UOR catalysis, the as-synthesized amorphous nickel carbonate decorated on glass carbon electrode delivers a current density of 117.69 mA.cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs. RHE with a small Tafel slope of 40.7 mV.dec(-1), which is comparable to the most active reported catalysts.

J	Baker, DR; Lundgren, CA				Baker, David R.; Lundgren, Cynthia A.			Expansion of the urea electrocatalytic oxidation window by adsorbed nickel ions	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY												The electrocatalytic oxidation of urea using Ni-based catalysts is able to oxidize urea at high rates, reaching hundreds of mA cm(-2) depending on electrode and solution properties. Most of the demonstrated systems, however, report a drop-off in current similar to 0.3 V positive of the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox transition resulting in a dramatic decrease of activity. The drop-off limits the electrochemical window available for urea decomposition. To overcome this narrow window, Ni2+ ions are herein adsorbed onto carbon black electrodes cohesively bound with Nafion. The resulting electrodes are electrochemically tested for urea electro-oxidation activity whereby their cyclic voltammograms display no drop-off in activity up to 1.5 V positive of the Ni2+/Ni3+ transition. The oxidation currents of the adsorbed Ni2+ electrodes demonstrate urea decomposition rates nearly identical to Ni-metal films, and impedance measurements show similar charge transfer limitations. Electrodes are monitored after electrochemical cycling with atomic force microscopy to reveal that adsorbed species coalesce into surface particles, which behave like bulk Ni(OH)(2), implying that the commonly observed drop-off in current may be due to structural characteristics of Ni(OH)(2) and NiOOH. The simplicity of the adsorption process and its ability to widen the electrochemical window for urea oxidation allows new substrates to be incorporated into urea degradation systems without sacrificing high urea oxidation rates.

However, the sluggish kinetics of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) requires valence-variable sites that are generally active at high anodic overpotentials. Herein, a robust ceramic coating is constructed with coupled tungsten nitride (WN)/nickel carbide (Ni3C) nanoparticles to achieve valence-stable catalytic sites with outstanding UOR performance. Various characterization results indicate strong interfacial electron transfer from WN to Ni3C in coupled nanoparticles, which enables reservation of Ni2+ sites without self-oxidation during UOR, quite distinct from the kinetically slow Ni3+ OOH-catalyzed UOR pathway. Theoretical calculations show that the coupled effect in WN/Ni3C leads to enhanced electron transfer from catalytic sites to adsorbed urea, and W sites are thermodynamically favorable for UOR. This efficiently lowers the barrier of rate-determining step (RDS: *CO-N-2.-> *CO center dot OH), thus enabling fast UOR kinetics and a low potential of 1.336 V at 100 mAcm(-2), which identifies this ceramic coating as one of the best UOR electrocatalysts. This work opens a new avenue for design of stable and active sites in ceramics coatings toward advanced electrocatalytic applications.

NiMn2O4, Ni1.5Mn1.5O4, and MnNi2O4 were synthesized by a simple template-free hydrothermal route followed by a thermal treatment in air at 800 degrees C. Rietveld analysis performed on nonstoichiometric nickel manganese oxide-Ni1.5Mn1.5O4 revealed the presence of three mixed phases: two spinel phases with different lattice parameters and NiO unlike the other two spinels NiMn2O4 and MnNi2O4. The electroactivity of nickel manganese oxide materials toward the oxidation of urea in alkaline solution is evaluated using cyclic voltammetric measurements. Ni1.5Mn1.5O4 exhibits excellent redox characteristics and lower charge transfer resistances in comparison with other compositions of nickel manganese oxides and nickel oxide prepared under similar conditions. The Ni1.5Mn1.5O4 modified electrode oxidizes urea at 0.29 V versus Ag/AgCl with a corresponding current density of 6.9 mA cm(-2). At a low catalyst loading of 50 mu g cm(-2), the urea oxidation current density of Ni1.5Mn1.5O4 in alkaline solution is 7 times higher than that of nickel oxide and 4 times higher than that of NiMn2O4 and MnNi2O4, respectively.

Phosphorus-doped nickel plating on carbon fibers (Ni-P/CF) is synthesized by simple electroless plating. SEM results exhibit that the Ni-P densely and uniformly grows onto the surface of carbon fibers (CF), forming carbon fibers-like nanoarchitectures. Benefiting from the carbon fibers-like nano architectures with abundant exposed active sites on the surface of CF, electron transfer can be synchronously facilitated, and Ni-P/CF displays superior urea electrooxidation (UOR) performance with potentials of 1.40 V to reach 100 mA cm-2. Impressively, it can maintain at 20 mA cm-2 for 48 h without evident activity attenuation, demonstrating robust durability. Cycle stability shows that the voltage has only increased by 10 mV at 300 mA cm-2 from the 10th to 20000th cycles. Most importantly, Ni-P/CF at a length of 100 cm with good reproducibility was successfully synthesized, denoting great potential for large-scale industrial production. Therefore, this work not only affords cost-effective tactics for urea-rich wastewater degradation but also can achieve practical medical applications.

Additionally, the decomposition of urea can help reduce environmental pollution. This paper improves the inherent activity of catalytic materials through morphology and electronic modulation by incorporating tungsten (W), which accelerates electron transfer, enhances the electronic structure of neighboring atoms to create a synergistic effect, and regulates the adsorption process of active sites and intermediates. NiCoW catalytic materials with an ultra-thin nanosheet structure were prepared using an ultrasonic-assisted NaBH4 reduction method. The results show that during the OER process, NiCoW catalytic materials have a potential of only 1.53 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, while the UOR process under the same conditions requires a lower potential of 1.31 V, demonstrating superior catalytic performance. In a mixed electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, overall water splitting also shows excellent performance. Therefore, the designed NiCoW electrocatalyst, with its high catalytic activity, provides valuable insights for enhancing the efficiency of water electrolysis for hydrogen production and holds practical research significance.

How to promote the performance of electrode and develop stable non -precious metal catalysts has caused extensive research. One of the effective strategies is combining two or more catalytic materials to build heterogeneous structures. In this paper, a series of Co0.3-Ni3S2/Ni3Sn2S2 heterostructured materials were synthesized to in -situ grow Ni3S2/Ni3Sn2S2 on Ni foam with a 3D porous structure by modulating the substance ratio of elemental cobalt and elemental sulfur through a one-step hydrothermal process. The materials have superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance. Under an alkaline electrolyte of 1 M KOH, for OER, Co0.3-Ni3S2/Ni3Sn2S2 only requires overpotential of 251 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm -2. In an alkaline solution of 1 M KOH +0.5 M urea, for UOR, only the potential of 1.326 V was demanded for the catalyst to reach a current density of 50 mA cm -2, but its stability over 15 h was average. Density Functional Theory (DFT) analyses suggest that Co-Ni3S2 has better metallic properties and promote the dynamics in catalysis. This study put forward a new thought for future research on nickel -tin binary metal sulfide hybrid electrocatalysts with excellent freshwater, seawater and urea oxidation properties.																			0360-3199	1879-3487				MAR 8	2024	58						117	127		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.186		JAN 2024											WOS:001167091500001

In this work, the ultrathin NiO nanosheets (NiO-NSs) decorated with ultrafine Rh nanocrystals (Rh-NCs) electrocatalyst (termed as Rh-NCs/NiO-NSs) is successfully synthesized by using mixed-cyanogels-NaBH4 method and succedent heat treatment. Physical characterizations confirm that as-prepared Rh-NCs/NiO-NSs have 1.6 nm thickness and a large specific surface area of 166.2 m(2)g(-1), and ultrafine Rh-NCs are uniformly dispersed on surface of NiO-NSs. Electrochemical measurements show that the incorporation of Rh-NCs can promote the generation of (NiOOH)-O-III species and accelerate the oxidation of CO, thus significantly improving the electrocatalytic performance of NiO-NSs for urea electro-oxidation reaction (UEOR). The UEOR current at Rh-NCs/NiO-NSs achieves the 616 mA mg(-1) at 1.55 V potential, which is 11.5 times bigger than that at NiO-NSs in 1 M KOH solution with 0.33 M urea.

Global concerns about cancer epidemiology mainly originate from anthropogenic activities, particularly fossil-based operations. A key solution to this problem is the use of fuel cells-devices-capable of the direct conversion of fuel chemical energies like urea into electricity. To make their commercialization reasonable, one of the problems that needs to be solved is the development of anodic materials. The majority of investigations on urea oxidation are based on nickel, but its inadequate activity limits the efficiency of these devices. In this work, we propose and synthesize a Ni-Cu-Fe ternary electrocatalyst for urea oxidation through a fast and facile electrodeposition method.

J	Protsenko, VS				Protsenko, Vyacheslav S.			Thermodynamic aspects of urea oxidation reaction in the context of hydrogen production by electrolysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												This work reports the revisited thermodynamic parameters of urea oxidation reaction CO(NH2) (2)+H2O -> N-2+3H(2)+CO2, which is used in the urea-assisted electrolytic cell for the electrochemical production of hydrogen. It has been repeatedly stated in the literature that the open-circuit voltage for this reaction is equal to 0.37 V, which is significantly less than in the case of hydrogen evolution with a coupled oxygen evolution reaction (1.23 V at 298 K). This feature is considered as a very important advantage of urea-assisted systems. Our calculations showed that the value of 0.37 V is erroneous, and the correct value of the open-circuit voltage is similar to 0.07 V. The specified thermodynamic parameters confirm the excellent prospects of electrochemical hydrogen production with the coupled reaction of urea oxidation and indicate wide potential opportunities for further reduction of energy consumption in the electrolysis process.

The surface properties of the CF are herein modified using a combination of nitric acid oxidation and urea to optimise the carrier to immobilise bacterial cells. The capacity of the CF carriers to immobilise bacterial cells and activated sludge is evaluated using bacterial cell adhesion and sludge immobilisation tests. The total interaction energy profiles between the CF supports and bacterial cells were calculated according to the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory to explain the mechanism by which these modifications enhance this immobilisation capacity. CF-U has a high capacity for immobilising bacterial cells and activated sludge (3.7 g-sludge/g-CF supports) owing to its low total interaction energy. Nitric acid oxidation reduced the diiodomethane contact angle of CF from 55.1 degrees to 38.5 degrees, which reduced the Lifshitz-van der Waals interaction energy, while urea modification further increased the zeta potential of CF from 12.8 mV to -0.7 mV, thereby reducing the electrostatic interaction energy. Experiments and DLVO theory both determined that a combination of nitric acid oxidation and urea modification significantly enhanced the ability of CF to immobilise microorganisms.

In this work, the nanostructured MoSe2/NiSe2 electrocatalyst with heterojunctions is constructed by a two-step hydrothermal method for HER coupling urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The presence of heterojunctions accelerates the charge transfer and enhances the conductivity of electrocatalysts; thus, the as-prepared nanostructured MoSe2/NiSe2 exhibits bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. Low overpotentials of 79 and 120 mV are required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for the HER and UOR, respectively. For the two-electrode urea electrolysis containing 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, a voltage of only 1.47 V is required to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show that the MoSe2/NiSe2 electrocatalyst can optimize the adsorption of H* and improve the HER activity because of the existence of the heterostructure. This work provides a promising potential for designing energy-saving hydrogen evolution catalysts with alternative electrode reactions.

Ni-based catalysts are widely used to catalyze this reaction via the intermediate formation of reactive NiOOH from nickel hydroxide. In this study, beta Ni(OH)(2) urea oxidation activity is compared to that of Ni/Ni(OH)(2). Electrochemical active surface area, exchange current density, rate constant, and capacitance are estimated for these catalysts to mechanistically probe the reaction. A quantitative electrochemical analysis of urea oxidation on these catalyst surfaces yields important reaction parameters. The reaction orders of beta Ni(OH)(2) with respect to KOH and (NH2)(2)CO are 1.22 and 0.26, respectively, at a kinetically-controlled potential of 1.43 V vs. RHE. The reaction order with respect to KOH decreases gradually with potential and it is almost constant with urea. The similar trends in reaction order are observed with Ni/Ni(OH)(2). Electrochemical impedance measurements displayed lower charge-transfer resistance of beta Ni(OH)(2) indicative of faster urea oxidation kinetics. It is observed that at the potential of 1.43 V, the charge transfer resistance of beta Ni(OH)(2) (87.3 Omega cm(ECSA)(2)) lowered by a factor of similar to 1.23 compared to Ni/Ni(OH)(2) (107.6 Omega cm(ECSA)(2)). The electrochemical surface area normalized heterogeneous rate constant of beta Ni(OH)(2) is similar to 2 times higher than that of Ni/Ni(OH)(2), in line their high intrinsic urea oxidation activity, capacitance and higher electrochemical phase stability. Moreover, the electrochemical chemical mechanism is observed on both catalysts in support with earlier report [1]. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, tungsten and sulfur species are successively doped into Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (S,W-Ni(OH)2) and synergistically promote the electrocatalytic activity towards urea electro-oxidation. Compared with Ni(OH)2 without doping or Ni(OH)2 doping with only one species, S,W-Ni(OH)2 exhibits faster reaction kinetic, larger ECSA, smaller charge transfer and urea adsorption resistance, which should guarantee the enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Potential dependent impedance measurements indicate that tungsten doping can prevent the electrocatalyst from being poisoned and sulfur doping will further enhance the charge transfer and urea adsorption ability. Therefore, simultaneously introducing sulfur and tungsten species into Ni(OH)2 should offer a promising way for designing efficient Ni-based electrocatalysts towards urea electro-oxidation.					liu, zirui/HNK-6782-2023; Liu, Yangyang/IST-5125-2023	Liu, Yangyang/0000-0001-5118-4901													0927-7757	1873-4359				MAY 20	2023	665								131226	10.1016/j.colsurfa.2023.131226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2023.131226		MAR 2023											WOS:001026750200001

The Co3O4 nanorods showed high purity phase and covered the surface of carbon cloth. As the electrode materials for hydrogen generation, it only required the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotential of 0.46 V to deliver the current density of 40 mA/cm(2) for HER and urea oxidation reaction potential (UOR vs RHE) of 1.62 V at 10 mA/cm(2). Remarkably, the assembled electrolyzer with Co3O4/CC and Pt foil as two electrodes demonstrated low potentials and a stable long cycle life. Therefore, the study displays a promising direction to explore the practical and effective ways for hydrogen production by overall urea electrolysis.

Because of the high voltage required for water electrolysis, using anodic urea oxidation process (UOR) to replace the oxygen evolution reaction can significantly cut energy usage. In this paper, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation process (UOR) electrocatalysts were synthesized by one-step carbonization using giant polyoxomolybdate cluster Mo132 and triethylamine at different temperatures. Ni/MoN@NC obtained at 800 degrees C shows good HER effect in the acidic electrolyte, an overpotential of 94 mV can provide the current density of 10 mA cm-2. Ni/NiO@NC obtained by calcination at 400 degrees C exhibits good UOR performance, in which the potential is 1.41 V when the current density is 10 mA cm-2. Efficient HER performance depends on the synergy of Ni and MoN. The highly efficient UOR is derived from the hierarchical structure of Ni and NiO. Furthermore, the porous structure also enhances the full contact between electrolyte and active sites, the catalytic performance of the catalyst was improved benefit to improve the catalytic activity. This work affords a general approach to simply synthesize efficient hydrogen producing materials for HER and small molecules oxidation fields.

Design of ultrafine nickel oxide nanostructured material for enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of urea: Physicochemical and electrochemical analyses	COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS												Ultrafine nanostructured-NiO is designed via a simple electrodeposition process on a glassy carbon surface. The morphological and structural characteristics of the nickel oxide/glassy-carbon (NiO/GC) are investigated through field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The electrocatalytic performance of the designed material towards urea oxidation in 1.0 M KOH is studied under different conditions of deposition time, scan rate and urea concentration. Electrochemical characterizations of urea oxidation are accomplished using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronoamperometry (CA). The electrodeposited ultrafine NiO displays a distinctive electrocatalytic urea oxidation performance. Numerically, the produced anodic current reached up to 1.089 mA for 0.25 M urea, with clear peaks for electrooxidation of urea in the forward and reverse sweep. EIS measurements showed that the diameter of semicircles is dependent on the experimental conditions, and the resistances of charge transfer values are found to be lower in the solutions containing urea, which is related to the excellent urea electrooxidation performance. Here, ultrafine nanostructured NiO is introduced to serve a critical function as a catalytic moderator to accelerate the charge transfer in the anodic part of the urea fuel-cell (UFC), which can affect both the efficiency and cost of UFCs.

Ionic liquid (IL) played an important role in synthesizing the catalysts. Physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalysts were analyzed for urea electrooxidation using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. The SNF-MWCNT electrocatalyst exhibited a very high current density of 3.12A cm(-2) mg(-1) at 20 mV s(-1) in 0.33 M urea and 5 M KOH solution aided by their Ni3+ rich surfaces, a porous and hollow structure and a favorable electronic effect of fluorine. The catalytic activity of SNF-MWCNT for urea oxidation was found superior than the commercially available Ni-C catalyst. The direct urea/air unit fuel cell showed a very promising performance by using SNF-MWCNT-5 mL IL as anode catalyst with a low amount of loading. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, the regulation of spin states for metal active sites by photoexcitation to facilitate the adsorption of urea and intermediates is demonstrated. Mo-doped nickel sulfide nanoribbon arrays (Mo-Ni3S2@NMF) with excellent light-trapping capacity are successfully prepared. Under AM 1.5G illumination, the activity of the Mo-Ni3S2@NMF exhibits a 50% improvement in the UOR current.

The electron spin resonance, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that illumination led to the formation of Ni3+ active sites in a high-spin state, which strengthens the d-p orbital hybridization of Ni-N, hence facilitating the adsorption of urea.

Perovskite fluorides have the advantages of intrinsic 3D diffusion pathways, robust architecture, and tunable chemical composition, thus receiving increasing attention in many applications. In this work, the UOR performances of a series of ABF3 samples (A = K; B = Ni/Mn, Ni/Co, Co/Mn) with various compositions are investigated in a systematic fashion for the first time. Among the binary samples, KNMF41 (Ni/Mn atomic ratio = 4:1) is the optimal sample with reduced overpotential (reaching 100 mA cm-2 at 1.43 V), low Tafel slope (40 mV dec- 1), enhanced reaction rate constant (6.3 x 105 cm3 mol- 1 s-1), and high turnover frequency (TOF, 0.19 s-1 at 1.60 V) toward urea oxidation. By comparing with Ni-Co and Co-Mn samples, the binary Ni-Mn design is confirmed to endow the perovskite fluoride with higher electrocatalytic activity, thanks to the directed adsorption of urea molecules on the adjacent Ni-Mn active sites. This work presents a targeted synthetic strategy for obtaining efficient electrocatalysts.

Electrochemical removal of urea from wastewater by anodic oxidation using a new cell design: An experimental and modeling study	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												Chlorine-mediated electrochemical urea oxidation was investigated using a new electrochemical cell design with horizontally oriented electrodes. By virtue of the novel electrode configuration, the new electrochemical cell is self-stirred by the H2 bubbles evolving at the cathode surface and contains a built-in cooler to remove excess heat generated during electrolysis. The effect of current density, pH, NaCl concentration and initial urea concentration on the urea removal and specific electrical energy consumption were investigated. The % urea removal ranged from 55% to 90% depending on the operating conditions. The rate of urea removal increased with increasing current density and NaCl concentration, while increasing the solution pH and initial urea concentration were found to decrease the rate of removal. Energy consumption decreased with increasing NaCl concentration and increasing initial urea concentration. A kinetic approach and response surface methodology were used to model the temporal profile of urea oxidation and to optimize the process variables. After 33.4 min of electrolysis of a solution containing 348.6 ppm urea, 3% NaCl concentration and an initial pH of 5.6 using an applied current density of 4.6 mA/cm2 (2.6 A), 73.8% urea removal could be achieved with an extremely low energy consumption of 9.58 kW h kg urea. The influential priorities of the five operating parameters on % urea removal and specific energy consumption were different. The obtained results revealed that the use of kinetic and statistical modeling is an adequate approach to optimize the process variables of electrochemical urea degradation.

This study reports breakthroughs in Ni-based UOR electrocatalysts, particularly with NiFe oxalate (O-NFF), derived from Ni3Fe alloy foam with prismatic nanostructures and elevated surface area. The O-NFF achieves cutting-edge performances, representing 500 mA cm-2 of current density at 1.47 V RHE and exceptionally low Tafel slope of 12.1 mV dec-1 (in 1 m KOH with 0.33 m urea). X-ray photoelectron/absorption spectroscopy (XPS/XAS) coupled with density functional theory calculations unveil that oxalate ligands induce charge deficient Ni center, promoting stable urea-O adsorption. Furthermore, Fe dopants enhance oxalate-O charge density and H-bond strength, facilitating C-N cleavage for N2 and NO2- formation. The extraordinary UOR kinetics by the tandem effects of oxalate and Fe prevent Ni over-oxidation, corroborated by operando XAS, minimizing OER interference. It agrees with an adaptive reconstruction to Fe-doped beta-NiOOH on top surface in extended urea electrolysis with marginal loss in UOR kinetics. This findings shed light to bimetal-organic-framework as (pre)catalysts to improve industrial electrolytic H2 production. Self-supported NiFe-oxalate (O-NFF) pillars show outstanding kinetics (500 mA cm-2 at 1.47 V RHE and Tafel slope of 12.1 mV dec-1) in urea oxidation reaction. In O-NFF, Operando X-ray absorption near edge structure confirms that the reaction with urea is dominant compared to Ni3+ being converted to Ni(3+delta)+. Density functional theory calculations highlight favorable bonding of oxalate ligand and Fe with urea-O.image					Cho, Kangwoo/ITV-4803-2023; Kim, Min-Cheol/AAF-3079-2020	Cho, Kangwoo/0000-0002-1819-7687													1616-301X	1616-3028				JUN	2024	34	25								10.1002/adfm.202315625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202315625		JAN 2024											WOS:001144480400001
J	Wang, Y; Liu, G				Wang, Ya; Liu, Gang			Reduced graphene oxide supported nickel tungstate nano-composite electrocatalyst for anodic urea oxidation reaction in direct urea fuel cell	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												In recent time direct urea fuel cell (DUFC) emerges as a potential candidate for sustainable urea reach wastewater treatment and power generation. The efficiency of DUFC mainly governed by the anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) kinetics. The design and development of efficient electrocatlysts for UOR remains a key factor for practical utilization of DUFC. In current study, we present a single step hydrothermal synthesis of NiWO4 NPs/rGO (h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO) composite for UOR catalysis in alkaline medium. The synthesized NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite offers a 218 mA/cm(2) UOR catalytic current density. Moreover, the h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite retains its 94% UOR catalytic current after 1000 cyclic voltammetric cycles. Further, h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite shows superior UOR catalytic performance than physical mixture of NiWO4 NPs and rGO, NiWO4 NPs, NiO/WO3 physical mixture and only NiO with reference to catalytic current density, onset potential, and durability. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite attributed to the synergetic coupling of physiochemical properties of NiWO4 NPs and rGO which improves the charge transfer generates larger electroactive surface and reduces catalyst poisoning. An air cathode DUFC with h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite modified anode and Pt/C cathode produces a maximum power density of 5.1 mW/cm(2) and 927 mV open circuit potential.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of urea fertilization on methanotrophic communities and methane oxidation. Chinese rice soil was incubated with urea at concentrations of 0, 200, 400, and 800 mg N kg(-1) dry soil, and methanotrophic communities were analyzed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the particulate methane monooxygenase gene (pmoA). Metabolically active methanotrophs were identified by combining T-RFLP analysis of pmoA transcripts and rRNA stable isotope probing. The results showed that a higher concentration of urea delayed the initiation of methane oxidation but stimulated the final methane oxidation rate of the rice soil. As more urea fertilizers were applied, acceleration of the methane oxidation rate occurred more rapidly. These effects were cumulative and were not directly related to the ammonium concentration in rice soil. Moreover, the activity of the Methylobacter/Methylosarcina group was stimulated by urea fertilizer, and the composition of the dominant and active methanotrophic community changed only slightly after 90 h. Our results indicated that urea fertilization generally stimulated methane oxidation and methanotrophic activity, primarily by stimulating the relative abundance and activity of the Methylobacter/Methylosarcina group.

Significance of Urea in Sustaining Nitrite Production by Ammonia Oxidizers in the Oligotrophic Ocean	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Nitrification, the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite, is a key process in the marine nitrogen cycle. Reported nitrite oxidation rates frequently exceed ammonia oxidation rates below the euphotic zone, raising the fundamental question of whether the two steps are balanced and if alternative sources contribute to nitrite production in the dark ocean. Here we present vertically resolved profiles of ammonia, urea, and nitrite oxidation rates and their kinetic traits in the oligotrophic Subtropical North Pacific. Our results show active urea-derived nitrogen oxidation (urea-N oxidation) in the presence of experimental ammonium amendment, suggesting direct urea utilization. The depth-integrated rates of urea-N oxidation and ammonia oxidation are comparable, demonstrating that urea-N oxidation is a significant source of nitrite. The additional nitrite from urea-N oxidation helps to balance the two steps of nitrification in our study region. Nitrifiers exhibit high affinity for their substrates, and the apparent half-saturation constants for ammonia and nitrite oxidation decrease with depth. The apparent half-saturation constant for urea-N oxidation is higher than that for ammonia oxidation and shows no clear vertical trend. Such kinetic traits may account for the relatively higher urea concentration than ammonium concentration in the ocean's interior. Moreover, a compilation of our results and reported data shows a trend of increased urea-N oxidation relative to ammonia oxidation from the eutrophic coastal zone to the oligotrophic open ocean. This trend reveals a substrate-dependent biogeographic distribution of urea-N oxidation across marine environments and provides new information on the balance and flux of the marine nitrification process. Active urea-derived nitrogen oxidation in the presence of added ammonium suggests direct urea utilization by marine ammonia oxidizers Substrate affinity regulates the vertical distribution of ammonia, urea, and nitrite in the ocean's interior Nitrite production from urea is comparable to that from ammonia oxidation in the energy-starved mesopelagic ocean					Tang, Jin-Ming/IAR-4698-2023; Dai, Minhan/G-3343-2010; Kao, Shuh-Ji/F-8418-2015	Wan, Xianhui/0000-0002-4870-7369; Dai, Minhan/0000-0003-0550-0701; Tang, Jin-Ming/0000-0002-7001-7700; Kao, Shuh-Ji/0000-0002-5054-9099; Shen, Hui/0009-0003-4608-5628													0886-6236	1944-9224				OCT	2024	38	10							e2023GB007996	10.1029/2023GB007996	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GB007996													WOS:001331807000001

We study the influences of these two convenient chemicals in presence of sodium aluminate and find very different effects on film growth. Urea addition enhances the nitrogen content of PEO layer, diminishes the layer thickness, increases the porosity, interferes with the alpha-alumina formation, and promotes precipitation in the electrolyte. Hence, the electrolytic urea content ought to be maintained less than 45 g dm(-3). On the other hand, sodium nitrite behaves like an oxidation additive, more than a nitridation additive. NaNO2 addition effectively introduces nitrogen in the PEO layer at low concentration, yet the nitrogen content of oxide layer decreases with increasing NaNO2 concentration. The effects of NaNO2, such as increasing layer thickness, reducing porosity, promoting alpha-alumina formation are attributed to oxidation enhancement, not because of nitridation.

Herein, a sulfur-vacancy (Sv) engineering is proposed to accelerate the formation of metal (oxy)hydroxide on the surface of Ni-Co bimetal sulfide nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (Sv-CoNiS@NF) for boosting the urea oxidation electrocatalysis. As a result, the obtained Sv-CoNiS@NF demonstrates an outstanding electrocatalytic UOR performance, which requires a low potential of only 1.397 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode to achieve the current density of 100 mA cm-2. The ex situ Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations reveal the key roles of the Sv site and Co9S8 in promoting the electrocatalytic UOR performance.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) poses a significant challenge due to its unfavorable thermodynamics, making it a pivotal step in urea splitting. The 6 -electron transfer process of UOR presents a bottleneck due to its sluggish kinetics. Consequently, the development of efficient urea oxidation electrocatalysts and gaining insights into the electronic configuration of the central metal ion are of paramount significance in achieving high-performance urea -based energy conversion technologies. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of hierarchical Ni 2 P nanosheets@nanorods (P-Ni 2 P HNNs) as promising catalysts to enhance UOR efficiency. This catalyst is designed and constructed using a hexamethylenetetramine-hydrolytic coprecipitation-oxidation process and a straightforward phosphorus -substituted method. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy indicates that the presence of P -modified metal centers is responsible for the elevated UOR activity of P-Ni 2 P HNNs, with the electronic structure of Ni n+ significantly enhancing Ni-O-O bond coupling for rapid UOR kinetics. Thanks to the highly exposed Ni n+ centers and the well -designed architecture, P-Ni 2 P HNNs exhibit superior UOR activity and stability, with a low overpotential of 132 mV at 10 mA center dot cm -2 , a small Tafel slope of 33.7 mV center dot dec -1 , and sustained durability for 6 h at 10 mA center dot cm -2 . Furthermore, a two -electrode cell for overall urea electrolysis is assembled with a P-Ni 2 P HNNs-2/NF anode, yielding a low potential of 1.411 V at 10 mA center dot cm -2 and a high current density of 100 mA center dot cm -2 at 1.595 V.

Understanding the Mechanism of Urea Oxidation from First-Principles Calculations	CHEMPHYSCHEM												Developing electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) works toward sustainably treating urea-enriched water. Without a clear understanding of how UOR products form, advancing catalyst performance is currently hindered. This work examines the thermodynamics of UOR pathways to produce N2, NO2-, and NO3- on a (0001) beta-Ni(OH)2 surface using density functional theory with the computational hydrogen electrode model. Our calculations show support for two major experimental observations: (1) N2 favours an intramolecular mechanism, and (2) NO2-/NO3- are formed in a 1 : 1 ratio with OCN-. In addition, we found that selectivity between N2 and NO2-/NO3- on our model surface appears to be controlled by two key factors, the atom that binds the surface intermediates to the surface and how they are deprotonated. These UOR pathways were also examined with a Cu dopant, revealing that an experimentally observed increased N2 selectivity may originate from increasing the limiting potential required to form NO2-. This work builds towards developing a more complete atomic understanding of UOR at the surface of NiOxHy electrocatalysts. We examine the pathways to form either N2 or NO2-/NO3- on a Ni(OH)2 surface using density functional theory.

To determine the crystalline structure and morphology of prepared electrocatalysts, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed. The electrocatalytic activity of NiO/carbon support electrocatalysts was investigated towards urea electro-oxidation reaction in NaOH solution using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Urea oxidation peak current density was increased in the following order: NiO/AC < NiO/MWCNTs < NiO/Gr < NiO/Gt. Chronoamperometry test also showed an increased steady state oxidation current density for NiO/Gt in comparison to other electrocatalysts. The increased activity and stability of NiO/Gt electrocatalyst encourage the application of graphite as an efficient and cost-saving support to carry metal nanoparticles for urea electro-oxidation reaction.

The UOR activity of the NP-Ni catalyst has been studied at various boric acid (H3BO3) concentrations, demonstrating superior activity at a specific electrolytic composition of 0.5 M KOH, 0.33 M urea, and 50 mM of H3BO3. Based on a wide range of electrochemical techniques, such as, cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Pb-anodic deposition, and chronoamperometry (CA), we develop a potential mechanism for the [B(OH)4]--mediated UOR. The high double layer capacitance, surface density of Ni redox sites, and urea oxidation currents, clearly demonstrate the significant impact of [B(OH)4]-during electrolysis. Furthermore, we find that UOR catalyzed by the NP-Ni is controlled by diffusion both in presence and absence of [B(OH)4]-. Finally, a set of physical characterizations, including XPS, SEM, and TEM were performed to correlate the composition and structure of the NP-Ni to the [B(OH)4]--mediated increased UOR activity. The improved UOR activity attributed to the [B(OH)4]- mediation could open a new possibility of research for UOR driven wastewater treatment.

Nickel (Ni) nanoparticles grown on nanosheets were prepared by a facile hydrothermal reaction and a subsequent calcination process of silicon oxide/nitrogen-doped carbon (SiOx/N-C) as the precursor, in which SiOx/N-C with a natural three-dimensional (3D) interconnected structure was obtained from bamboo leaves. The nickel/silicon oxide/nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni/SiOx/N-C, denoted as Y) obtained at 900 degrees C (Y3), exhibits the most optimal catalytic properties for the UOR with a low potential of 1.384 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). The protective role of SiOx was also explored via the partial etching of SiOx (Y3-NaOH), and the results show that the overpotential of the curve increased rapidly after long-term test. The findings indicate that full exploitation of the comprehensive advantages of biomass materials is beneficial for alleviating the problems encountered in the development of energy-related technologies.

At the current density of 10 mA cm 2, it only needed the overpotential of 270 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and only needed potential of 1.30 V for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Experimental results show that the increased activity is attrib-uted to the rapid charge transfer rate, the exposure of more active sites and the enhanced conductivity due to the synergistic catalysis of CoP and V3P. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the CoP material exhibits higher urea adsorption energy, which promotes catalysis. The V3P material shows a higher density of states near the Fermi level, indicating that it has better conductivity. The synergistic catalysis of the two enhanced the catalytic activity of the CoVP material. This study provides a new idea for the synthesis of catalytic electrode materials in the anodic oxidation aspect of urea electrol-ysis, and provides a further understanding for the improvement of catalytic performance of relatively non-toxic catalysts.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Controllable synthesis of urea-assisted Co3O4 nanostructures as an effective catalyst for urea electrooxidation	COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS												Nonprecious urea-assisted Co3O4 nanostructures with different urea concentrations were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The structural variations of four different electrocatalysts of Co3O4 were investigated using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The change in morphology of all Co3O4 samples can be ascribed to urea-assisted controlled synthesis procedures. Linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies were conducted using a three-electrode system to examine the electrocatalytic behavior of the samples for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in an alkaline medium. Co3O4 synthesized with a high urea concentration exhibited good electrocatalytic activity for the UOR. At an oxidation potential of 0.65 V, the self-assembled electrocatalysts delivered the highest current density of 98.6 mA g-1. This sample showed a higher electrochemical active surface area (ECSA-242.5 mF cm-2) and BET surface area (22.27 m2 g-1) than others. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of this sample can be attributed to adding a higher urea concentration during the synthesis steps and its structural morphology, which enhanced the reaction kinetics.

In this paper, a series of Ni-Co precursors supported by carbon cloth (CC) were prepared by hydrothermal method and subsequently treated with phosphating and oxidation, respectively. The phosphating products and oxidation products were used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. The materials morphology and electron configuration were also controlled by adjusting relative Ni-Co content in the precursors. Furthermore, the effects of different Ni-Co ratios on electrocatalytic activity under the same crystal structure were discussed in detail. Benefited from the optimum electron structure and maximum active sites, Ni2Co1-P/CC displayed the best HER catalytic performance, with an overpotential of 79 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). On account of the comparatively low theoretical oxidation voltage of urea, NixCo3-x-O/CCs displayed a much lower working potential in urea-containing electrolyte than the urea-free electrolyte. Thereinto, Ni1.5Co1.5-O/CC showed the best UOR catalytic performance, with a potential of 1.362 V at eta(10) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea. With the combination of the above catalysts, it needed only 1.47 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the electrolytic cell for hydrogen production via UOR. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Urea-containing wastewater poses severe threats to the environment and human health. Numerous studies hence focus on developing UOR as a viable process for simultaneously remediating wastewater and converting it into energy. Moreover, UOR, which has a thermodynamic potential of 0.37 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), shows great promise in replacing the energy-intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER; 1.23 V vs RHE). The versatility and stability of urea, particularly at ambient temperatures, make it an attractive alternative to hydrogen in fuel cells. Since UOR entails a complex intermediate adsorption/desorption process, many studies are devoted to designing cost-effective and efficient catalysts. Notably, transition metal-based materials with regulated d orbitals have demonstrated significant potential for the UOR process. However, comprehensive reviews focusing on transition metal-based catalysts remain scarce. In light of this, the review aims to bridge the gap by offering an in-depth and systematic overview of cutting-edge design strategies for transition metal-based catalysts and their diverse applications in UOR. Additionally, the review delves into the status quo and future directions, charting the course for further advancements in this exciting field.

Some drawbacks such as scarcity and poor catalytic performance limit the application of noble metal-based catalysts in the oxidation of urea, it is particularly necessary to design and synthesize non-noble metal-based catalysts with good catalytic per-formance. In this work, we have fabricated Ni-based composites (Ni/NiO-N-C) through the pyrolysis of the precursor Ni(OH)(2)@PPH (polyaniline-polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels). The optimal Ni/NiO-N-C-500 catalyst displays an excellent activity of 182 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs SCE for UOR in alkaline media. Meanwhile, Ni/NiON-C-500 also indicates excellent stability after 1000 cycling CV tests (81% capacitance retention), which is attributed to the synergy between Ni/NiO nanocrystalline active centers and nitrogen-doped carbon substrate, that is, N-doped carbon layers improve the surface electron density and the electrical conductivity of the composite catalyst, thus leading to the improvement of the catalytic activity of catalyst. On account of its easy synthesis, high activity and good durability, the Ni/NiO-N-C-500 catalyst has the potential to act as a good alternative material for precious metal-based catalysts in DUFCs.

Despite significant progress in efficient nickel-based catalysts, the fundamental issues regarding product selectivity control and dissociation mechanism during the UOR process have not been clarified. Here, we report that tuning the electron delocalization strength of Ni sites significantly affects the OH- binding sites, altering urea molecule dissociation patterns in alkaline systems. Using spinel NiCo2O4 as a model catalyst, the charge delocalization strength of nickel active centers is influenced by the degree of phosphorus-substituted anions. Specifically, complete phosphorus-substituted spinel enhances N2 selectivity up to 26.8 % with a peak current density of 300 mA & sdot; cm-2, while partial phosphorus-substituted spinel achieves a Faraday efficiency of 78.1 % for liquid products (NOx-). Experiments and theory reveal that strong charge delocalization at Ni sites favors remote-site attack on urea molecules by hydroxide ions, whereas weak delocalization prefers nearby-site attack, enhancing UOR efficiency and suppressing OER in both pathways.

Simultaneously, the synergistic effect between crystalline NiCoO and amorphous MoOx improves the UOR and HER activity, merely requiring 1.28 V and -45 mV potentials to reach +10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Particularly, the UOR kinetics of NiCoO-MoOx/NC is enhanced significantly compared to that of NiCoO/NC. The electronic structure of NiCoO is modified by MoOx, enabling the rapid generation of NiOOH and CoOOH active species, which would accelerate the synergistic electrocatalytic oxidation of urea molecules.

Herein, we report the fabrication of NiS nanotubes with hierarchical sheet-like surface morphology via a novel template-directed hydrothermal reaction as efficient UOR electrocatalyst. The unique hollow structure of NiS nanotubes provides the exposure of more active sites and excellent electron/mass transport properties, ensuring a superior UOR performance. The NiS nanotubes catalyst shows a very low potential at around 1.39 V vs. RHE at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH/0.33 M urea solution. And the UOR current density of the catalyst at 1.4 V vs. RHE reaches 135 mA cm(-2), representing a superior UOR performance. The NiS nanotubes catalyst also possesses an excellent operational stability. Furthermore, a two-electrode urea-assisted overall water splitting (OWS) device assembled with NiS nanotubes as anode and Pt/C as cathode delivers a working voltage of 1.445 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2), which is 188 mV less than that for the urea-free OWS electrolyzer, demonstrating its possibility to be applicable for energy efficient hydrogen production.

Here, in this work, we synthesize a series of nickel nanoparticles embedded nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (Ni@NCNT) and study the effect of nitrogen dopants on UOR catalytic activity. The nitrogen dopants can weaken the binding strength between CO2 species and active sites resulting in alleviation of CO2 poisoning; simultaneously, nitrogen dopants also promote the in-situ conversion of Ni3+ species facilitating UOR catalysis; as a result, electrocatalytic current density of 45.8 mA cm(-2) is recorded for Ni@NCNT in 1 M KOH electrolyte with 0.5 M urea at 1.5 V vs. RHE, which is 3.8 fold better than commercial PVC (11.8 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, Ni@ NCNT, due to the more nitrogen dopants, exhibits a comparable overpotential to commercial PVC for driving hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysis in 1 M KOH electrolyte at high current density (400 mA cm(-2)). Subsequently, 1.56 V is demanded for overall UOR catalysis on Ni@NCNT with current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work offers useful information for designing a stable and efficient electrocatalyst for not only UOR but also electrochemical generation of H-2 from wastewater.

J	Tsai, SC; Wu, MS				Tsai, Shu-Cheng; Wu, Mao-Sung			Hydrothermal growth of pompon-like manganese oxide microspheres with embedded nickel ions as single-atom catalysts for urea oxidation	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												]Manganese oxides (delta-MnO2) with pompon-like microspheres and non-spherical shaped particles were hydrothermally grown on Ni foam substrates in the presence and absence of a structure-directing agent (ammonium fluoride), respectively. The intercalated K+ ions in the layer-structured MnO2 were exchanged by the dissolved nickel ions from Ni foam during hydrothermal synthesis, leading to the formation of MnO2 with embedded nickel ions (labeled as Ni foam@Ni-MnO2). The dominated oxidation state of nickel ions in MnO2 was found to be trivalent (Ni3+), making Ni foam@Ni-MnO2 a promising catalyst electrode for direct and indirect urea oxidation reactions (UORs). Ni foam@Ni-MnO2 exhibited large electroactive surface area and high oxidation state of nickel-ion catalyst for adsorption of urea molecule and the successive cleavage of urea. Pompon-like microspheres with ultrathin nanosheets offered abundant pore channels to facilitate the spread of urea molecules and products in the UOR process. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that Ni foam@Ni-MnO2 with pompon-like microspheres has lower direct UOR impedance and indirect UOR impedance in the regeneration of active Ni3+ catalyst than Ni foam. Thus, Ni foam@Ni-MnO2 displayed greater current density and smaller onset potential than bare Ni foam in catalyzing UOR. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, inspired by the natural nutrient transport within plants, a hierarchically-three dimensional structure is obtained by the in-situ growth of nickel sulfide composites on nickel foam. It demonstrates an efficient UOR catalytic performance with a low potential of 1.343 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) to reach 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 34.8 mV dec-1 and stable long-term durability (25 h with only 3.0 % activity drop), which surpasses those of many recently published works. Moreover, an actual human urine electrolytic cell is assembled, which exhibits a cell voltage of 1.427 V at 10 mA cm-2, demonstrating its practical applica-tion in urine and urea-rich wastewater treatment. The performance of the catalyst can be attributed to the hier-archically-three dimensional structures with both Ni3S2 microrods and hollow NiS nanoframes contributing to the improved catalytic performance in UOR.

The catalytic site density, intrinsic activity, charge transfer, and mass diffusion determine overall electrocatalytic efficiency. Simultaneous modulation over the above four factors promises advanced electrocatalysis, yet challenging. Herein we propose a systematic regulation tactic over composition and geometric structure, constructing a nanocomposite comprising Mn doped Ni3N nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO/Mn-Ni3N), achieving elegant integration of four design principles into one, thereby eminently boosting UOR. Particularly, Mn doping in Ni3N can modulate electronic state to induce intrinsic activity regulation. Combining metallic Mn-Ni3N with rGO to engineer hierarchical architecture not only promotes charge transfer, but also enriches active site population. Intriguingly, improved hydrophilicity could impart better electrolyte penetration and gas escape. Consequently, such system-optimized rGO/Mn-Ni3N demonstrates state-of-the-art-level UOR electrocatalysis. This work offers a novel paradigm to create advanced catalysts via systematic and integrated modulation. (c) 2023 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a sluggish anodic reaction, usually suffers from high overpotential, which greatly impedes the efficiency of hydrogen generation. Herein, we report an ultrathin NiMn-LDH/CFC growth on commercial carbon fiber cloth (U-NiMn-LDH/CFC) substrate through a facile hydrothermal method. The U-NiMn-LDH/CFC can be successfully used to assemble an energy-saving water splitting system via integrating anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The as-prepared U-NiMn-LDH/CFC nanosheets with ultrathin structure exhibit reliable electrocatalytic activities toward UOR (1.351 V vs. RHE@20 mA cm(-2)) and HER (169 mV@10 mA cm(-2)). A two-electrode water splitting cell is further constructed and delivers almost 210 mV lower oxidation potential at 10 mA cm(-2) with containing (1.0 M KOH) 0.5 M urea in comparison to that in pure overall water splitting. Furthermore, the above two-electrode system shows excellent electrolysis stability.

Transition metal phosphides ((NiFe)(2)P) were prepared by regulating polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) addition during the materials preparation, and their electrocatalytic performance for urea oxidation coupled hydrogen production was investigated. It was found that the material prepared with the PVP addition of 300 mg shows the best catalytic activity. The potential required to reach 100 mA cm(-2) in KOH +urea solution is only 1.433 V with an impedance value of 4.128 Omega, which is 103 mV lower than that in KOH solution. Hydrogen evolution in KOH solution required 414 mV to reach -100 mA cm(-2) with an impedance value of 48.75 omega, while the potential required to reach the same current density in KOH+urea solution is only 343 mA with an impedance value of 5.65 Omega. As a result, the energy barrier and electron transfer resistance of electrocatalytic reaction can be significantly reduced by urea oxidation, and it provides a strategy for large-scale application of water electrolysis.

In-situ generated Ni(OH)2 on chemically activated spent catalyst sustains urea electro-oxidation in extensive alkaline conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an efficient way to produce cost-effective hydrogen from ureabased wastes. We show that a chemical modification involving partial oxidation of the spent catalyst consisting of Ni@CNT, generated from industrial methane decomposition plants, is found to augment sustained UOR activity for a prolonged time in extensive alkaline conditions. The activated catalyst, Ni(OH)2-Ni@CNT exhibits a TOF of 0.5 s-1 and Tafel slope of 30 mV/dec retaining UOR activity for 60 h at -75 mA/cm2 in 1.6 M urea and 6 M KOH. In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that Ni in the activated spent catalyst possesses an average oxidation state of -1.4 and Ni(OH)2 content gets enhanced from 26 % to 30 % during UOR representing fresh Ni (OH)2 formation. The activated Ni nanoparticles wrapped with carbon nanotubes provide excellent activity, COx removal, turnover frequency, and favors in-situ formation of fresh Ni(OH)2 responsible for the activity retention.

J	Soni, P; Pal, B; Das, RK				Soni, Palak; Pal, Bonamali; Das, Raj Kumar			Influence of β-CD and Ag deposition over TiO2 towards photocatalytic oxidation of urea under solar irradiation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Photocatalytic oxidation of urea is an essential area of study for converting urea to nitrate. As crops absorb nitrogen in the form of NO3- but due to incomplete oxidation, a substantial fraction of it escapes into the atmosphere as N-2. Hence, an effective photocatalyst is urgently needed to improve nitrate conversion. This study focuses on the influence of beta-cyclodextrin and Ag deposition on TiO2 towards the photocatalytic oxidation of urea. beta-cyclodextrin (15-25 wt%) and Ag(1-3 wt%) loaded binary and ternary nanocomposites have been prepared using hydrothermal and photodeposition methods, respectively. The binary and ternary hybrids were characterized using FESEM, EDX, HR-TEM, XRD, XPS, DRS, PL, DLS, and FT-IR analysis. Photocatalytic urea degradation activity was evaluated under solar irradiation. The beta-CD25/TiO2@Ag-1 ternary nanocomposites show 78% degradation efficiency with 17.8% nitrate yield after 180 min reaction time which is the highest. This observation can be ascribed to the higher affinity of beta-CD towards N-2 due to the hydrophobic effect and the surface plasmon effect of Ag, which amplifies its visible light response. Such observations will attract much interest from a large section of material and agricultural chemists to design new catalysts for photochemical urea oxidation to afford sustainable agriculture.

However, the practical application of UOR has been hindered by sluggish kinetics. In this study, hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays featuring abundant Ni-WO3 heterointerfaces on nickel foam (Ni-WO3/NF) is introduced as a monolith electrode, demonstrating exceptional activity and stability toward UOR. The Ni-WO3/NF catalyst exhibits unprecedentedly rapid UOR kinetics (200 mA cm-2 at 1.384 V vs. RHE) and a high turnover frequency (0.456 s-1), surpassing most previously reported Ni-based catalysts, with negligible activity decay observed during a durability test lasting 150 h. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations elucidate that the WO3 interface significantly modulates the local charge distribution of Ni species, facilitating the generation of Ni3+ with optimal affinity for interacting with urea molecules and CO2 intermediates at heterointerfaces during UOR. This mechanism accelerates the interfacial electrocatalytic kinetics. Additionally, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy provides deep insights into the substantial contribution of interfacial Ni-WO3 sites to UOR electrocatalysis, unraveling the underlying molecular-level mechanisms. Finally, the study explores the application of a direct urea fuel cell to inspire future practical implementations. The superior activity and stability of WO3-coupled Ni catalysts toward urea oxidation reaction are attributed to the regulated local charge distribution of Ni atoms at heterointerfaces by Mott-Schottky heterojunction engineering. This controlled charge distribution results in enhanced performance, allowing for high efficiency in the direct urea fuel cell. image					Sun, Minglei/G-6804-2017; Yuan, Zhong-Yong/B-5157-2012	Yuan, Zhong-Yong/0000-0002-3790-8181													2366-9608					DEC	2024	8	12								10.1002/smtd.202400108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202400108		APR 2024						38558249					WOS:001194405200001

The preparation method significant affect the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Comparing with cobalt supported on tantalum oxide prepared by impregnation method, Co/Ta2O5 prepared by deposition-precipitation method with urea in this study has smaller particle size, higher specific surface area and better redox properties, and these features make the catalyst exhibit higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation at mild condition. 90% CO conversion was achieved at 130 degree celsius, and CO was fully converted at 150 degree celsius. The XPS and DRIFTs results show that Co/Ta2O5 has more oxygen vacancies, and the absorbed CO will react with oxygen.

Removal of urea by electro-oxidation in a miniature dialysis device: a study in awake goats	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-RENAL PHYSIOLOGY												The key to success in developing a wearable dialysis device is a technique to safely and efficiently regenerate and reuse a small volume of dialysate in a closed-loop system. In a hemodialysis model in goats, we explored whether urea removal by electro-oxidation (EO) could be effectively and safely applied in vivo. A miniature dialysis device was built, containing 1 or 2 "EO units." each with 10 graphite electrodes, with a cumulative electrode surface of 585 cm(2) per unit. The units also contained poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) sulfonate beads, FeOOH beads, and activated carbon for respective potassium, phosphate, and chlorine removal. Urea, potassium, and phosphate were infused to create "uremic" conditions. Urea removal was dependent on total electrode surface area [removal of 8 mmol/h (SD 1) and 16 mmol/h (SD 2) and clearance of 12 ml/min (SD 1) and 20 ml/min (SD 3) with 1 and 2 EO units, respectively] and plasma urea concentration but not on flow rate. Extrapolating urea removal with 2 EO units to 24 h would suffice to remove daily urea production. but for intermittent dialysis, additional units would be required. EO had practically no effects on potassium and phosphate removal or electrolyte balance. However, slight ammonium release was observed, and some chlorine release at higher dialysate flow rates. Minor effects on acid-base balance were observed, possibly partly due to infusion of chloride. Mild hemolysis occurred, which seemed related to urea infusion. In conclusion, clinically relevant urea removal was achieved in vivo by electro-oxidation. Efficacy and safety testing in a large-animal model with uremia is now indicated.

Here a facile approach is proposed for synthesizing multimetallic oxide subnanometer nanobelts (MMO-PMA SNBs) by harnessing the potential of phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) clusters to capture inorganic nuclei and inhibiting their subsequent growth in solvothermal reactions. Experimental and theoretical analyses show that PMA in MMO-PMA SNBs not only aids subnanometer structure formation but also induces in situ modifications to catalytic sites. The electron transfer from PMA, coupled with the loss of elemental identity of transition metals, leads to electron delocalization, jointly activating the reaction sites. The unique structure makes pentametallic oxide (PMO-PMA SNBs) achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low potential of 1.34 V and remain stable for 24 h at 10 mA cm-2 on urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The exceptional UOR catalytic activity suggests a potential for utilizing multimetallic subnanometer nanostructures in energy conversion and environmental remediation. Subnanometer multimetallic oxide nanobelts are obtained through low-temperature synthesis. The subnanometer size as well as the multimetallic components generate high vibrational and configurational entropy, which further induces valence electron delocalization, promoting efficient urea oxidation catalysis at low overpotentials. The work unlocks the entropic and electronic advantages of high-entropy subnanometer nanomaterials. image					Wu, Liang/ADX-8602-2022; wang, xin/U-7341-2017														1613-6810	1613-6829				NOV	2024	20	44								10.1002/smll.202404595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202404595		JUL 2024						38966880					WOS:001262236400001

Urea oxidation had been considered as an alternative reaction due to its much lower oxidation potential. Rational design of highly efficient cost-effective electrocatalysts for urea oxidation is therefore urgent for hydrogen production from overall urea oxidation. Here, the Ni/Mo2C@CN catalyst consisting of a porous carbon shell and a heterojunction Ni/Mo2C core was constructed by an in situ self-confinement synthesis strategy. The mutual promotion effect of Ni and Mo2C can boost the urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions at the same time. Only 1.51 V applied potential was needed to achieve stable 10 mA/cm(2) overall urea oxidation on the Ni/Mo2C@CN catalyst. By considering the great stability resulting from the protective effect of the carbon shell, a practical application potential of Ni/Mo2C@CN in overall urea oxidation was achieved.

This necessitates the development of highly efficient and stable catalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this study, a NiCoCr-LDH/NF (nickel-cobalt-chromium layered double hydroxide/nickel foam) electrode is successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method, demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic performance with a low work potential of 1.38 V at a high current density of 100 mA cm-2. In situ, Raman spectra analysis revealed that the incorporation of chromium (Cr) facilitated the generation of active gamma-NiOOH species and catalyst reconstruction. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations confirmed that the lower formation energy of gamma-NiOOH is due to the weakened interaction of O & horbar;H bonds because of a narrow energy range of hybridization between O-2pz orbitals and H-1s orbitals. The introduction of Cr also improved the adsorption energy of urea molecules and its intermediates, thereby enhancing the overall activity of UOR. With its excellent electrocatalytic performance, unique electronic states, and coordination structures, the NiCoCr-LDH/NF electrode showcases great potential for practical applications in the field of energy catalysis. Chromium-doping in NiCoCr-LDH/NF: lowering the energy barrier for gamma-NiOOH active species speciation and enhancing phase-transition for high urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance.

Thus, substituting the OER with the UOR can effectively reduce the voltage required for electrolysis. Transition metal phosphates (TM-Pi), with their unique physical properties, can partly replace precious metal catalysts and hold great application potential. However, further modification is necessary to enhance their catalytic activity and stability. Therefore, this study prepared a coral-like cluster Co/Zn-Pi@NF (Pi represents phosphate) catalyst, which was grown in situ on nickel foam (NF) using the constant current electrodeposition method. The catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance in 1 M KOH, with the required overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER reaching 10 mA & sdot;cm- 2 being 36.6 mV and 343.4 mV, respectively. In 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea, the urea oxidation potential was only 1.4 V, which remained stable for 60 hours. The Co/Zn-Pi@NF nanoparticles were used as the anode and cathode for water-urea electrolysis, and the electrolysis voltage was 1.43 V at a current density of 10 mA & sdot;cm- 2, which was 290 mV lower than that of electrolyzed water. This study demonstrates that zinc-cobalt bimetallic phosphate can be used as a dual-function electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and urea oxidation.

Herein, Ni modified mesoporous Co2VO4 nanosheets with heterojunction structure is synthesized on nickel foam (Ni-Co2VO4/NF) by hydrothermal and calcination method. It shows good activity for UOR (eta(10/500/1,000) = 1.28/1.38/1.45 V) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, eta(-10/-500/-1,000) = 50/267/329 mV). Overall urea oxidation (OUO, eta(10) = 1.36 V) can maintain long-term stability at 500 mA cm(-2) for 140 h without significant activity decrease. This good activity could be due to the strongly coupled heterojunction of Ni and Co2VO4 that can modulate the interfacial electronic structure to form poor/rich-electron species for promoting urea/H2O adsorption and improving its UOR/HER intrinsic activity. Meanwhile, the mesoporous nanosheets structure with large specific surface area can expose more active sites and facilitate the desorption of bubbles on the electrode surface for improving UOR/HER reaction kinetics and stability at large current density. This work thus designs an efficient and stable bifunctional catalyst for urea-assisted hydrogen production at large current density.

Therefore, we synthesized MoS2/Ni3S2 electrocatalyst by a simple hydrothermal method, and studied its UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. The formed MoS2/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunction is only required 109 and 166 mV to obtain +/- 10 mA cm(-2) for UOR and HER, respectively, showing great bifunctional catalytic activity. Moreover, the full urea electrolysis driven by MoS2/Ni3S2 delivers 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low potential of 1.44 and 1.59 V. Comprehensive experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the MoS2/Ni3S2 Schottky heterojunction causes self-driven charge transfer at the interface and forms built-in electric field, which is not only benefit to reduce H* adsorption energy, but also helps to adjust the absorption and directional distribution of urea molecules, thereby promoting the activity of decomposition of water and urea. This research furnishes a tactic to devise more efficient catalysts for H(2)generation and the treatment of urea-rich water pollution. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this communication, we report that bimetallic NiCoP nanosheets array on carbon cloth acts as a superb and stable catalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with the need of potential of 0.455 V to achieve 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea. The excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) enables this electrode as a bifunctional UOR and HER catalyst and its two-electrode system affords 20 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.25 V, 360 mV smaller than that of pure water splitting, with strong long-term electrochemical stability.

However, the disadvantages of photocatalysts in a narrow absorption range and low utilization rate of solar energy still hinder the practical application. Here we fabricate two-dimensional porous Ruddlensden-Popper type nickel-based perovskite oxide La2NiO4 as a noble metal-free photoanode for photoelectrocatalytic urea oxidation under full spectrum sunlight irradiation. The transient photocurrent density under near infrared (NIR) light (lambda > 800 nm) can reach 50 mu A cm(-2). Urea wastewater was used as the fuel to obtain low-energy hydrogen production, and round-the-clock hydrogen production was achieved with the optimal yield of 22.76 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1). Moreover, a photocatalytic urea fuel cell (PUFC) was constructed with La2NiO4 as the photoanode. The power density under UV-vis-NIR was 0.575 mu W cm(-2). Surprisingly, the filling factor (FF) under NIR light was 0.477, which was much higher than those under UV-vis-NIR and visible light. The results demonstrated that PUFCs constructed from low-cost nickel-based perovskite oxides have potential applications for low-energy hydrogen production and efficient utilization of sunlight.

Urea electro-oxidation byproducts impact on NiO/NiOOH anode performance studied by operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												With significant quantities of urea (CO(NH2)(2)) being worldwide produced and its presence at high concentration in urine, simultaneous treatment of urea effluents and hydrogen production by paired electrolysis represents a very attractive approach in circular economy. Urea electro-oxidation on Ni-based catalysts in alkaline solution represents a promising approach, but poor stability of the Ni-based catalytic performance has been reported. In this work, the performance and stability of a nanostructured NiO/NiOOH anode for urea electro-oxidation has been evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). Firstly, the thickness of the NiOOH active film formed during the electrochemical activation process on NiO NPs (< 50 nm) is estimated from EIS data at about 4 nm. Secondly, the impact on the catalyst performance of all previously identified urea electro-oxidation by-products (ammonia (NH3), carbonate (CO32-), cyanate (-OCN) and nitrite (NO2-)) has been individually addressed by operando EIS, and none of them are responsible for the NiO/NiOOH catalytic deactivation. In addition to this, more insight into the competitive adsorption of CO(NH2)(2) and OH- on the catalyst surface during electrode aging was gained by the response of EIS in different potential regions.

Herein, we present a novel catalyst with 2D/3D multistage structure for the electro-oxidation of renewable biomass and harmful waste to assist hydrogen generation. The hierarchical configuration of NiO/CoO nanosheets interconnected by hollow carbon spheres, leveraging both 2D and 3D advantages. This structure provides rich surface and edge active sites as well as affluent electron and mass transfer pathways, resulting in the accelerated dynamics of electro-oxidation. The hollow carbon spheres serve as a buffering agent to alleviate the strain caused by repetitive redox reactions during electrolysis, thereby bestowing exceptional structural and chemical stability for prolonged operational durability. Additionally, the multiple continuous hetero-interfaces between NiO and CoO, NiO and carbon as well as CoO and carbon can ensure the fast electron transport, leading to the expedited reaction kinetics with the synergistic effect of phase engineering between NiO, CoO and carbon shell. As a result, the 3D carbon shells jointed 2D NiO/CoO hybrids demonstrate promising catalytic activities on electro-oxidation for energy-efficient hydrogen production (similar to 100 %(FE)) coupled with urea oxidation and formic acid synthesis with excellent selectivity (95.40 %) and satisfied faradic efficiency (91.6 %).																			2213-2929	2213-3437				DEC	2024	12	6							114956	10.1016/j.jece.2024.114956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2024.114956		NOV 2024											WOS:001411368900001

The prepared electrodes are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electro-catalytic performances towards urea electro-oxidation are tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) coupled with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). By phosphating Ni(OH)(2) precursor, the final obtained Ni2P@Ni foam electrode presents a porous Ni2P nanoflower structure within abundant porosity, and so exposes a large amount of electro-catalytic active sites and electronic transmission channels to accelerate the interfacial reaction. Compared with Ni(OH)(2)@Ni foam precursor, the Ni2P@Ni foam catalyst exhibits more excellent electro-catalytic activity as well as lower onset oxidation potential. Remarkably, the Ni2P@Ni foam catalyst reaches a peak current density of 750 mA cm(-2) with an onset oxidation potential of 0.24 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) accompanied by an excellent stability in 0.60 M urea with 5.00 M KOH solutions. Benefiting from the unique porous nanosheet structure, the as-synthesized Ni2P@Ni foam catalyst performs a highly enhanced catalytic behavior for alkaline urea electro-oxidation, indicating that the material can be hopefully applied in direct urea fuel cells.

It turns out that the initially thought "sustainable pathway", leading to harmless products, represents just a small fraction of the overall reaction mechanism. This is detrimental as the use of urea -rich aqueous feeds for H 2 production, along with their remediation through UOR, constitutes perhaps the most important added value of this process for power -to -X and clinical applications. Nonetheless, promising strategies favoring the formation of environmentally friendly products over harmful overoxidized ones already exist. This is expected to lead to a "rebirth" of this research field and open the quest for ultimate selectivity to ensure the complete sustainability of UOR. Therefore, the systematic analysis of reaction products, the elucidation of mechanisms for improving N 2 faradaic efficiency, and the design of selective catalysts should be the next focus of research in the field of UOR.

In this study, phosphating nickel foam (NF)-supported octahedral WO3 with phosphine affords P-WO3/NF electrocatalyst. Ni is found to form Ni-P bonds that migrate from NF to WO3 under the induction of P, resulting in the complex oxides W1.3Ni0.24O4 and Ni2P2O7 in the particle interior and nickel phosphide on the octahedral grain surface. The catalytic activity of P-WO3/NF in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is improved by synergistic action of the components in the synthesized hybrid particles. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be reached at a potential of 1.305 V, the double layer capacitance of the catalyst is significantly increased, and the electron transfer impedance in catalytic UOR is reduced.

Developing energyand time-saving methods to synthesize active and stable UOR catalysts is significant. Herein, we present a simple and time-efficient method for the direct growth of defect-rich few-layered NiMn-layered double hydroxide (NiMn-LDH) nanosheets on nickel foam at ambient temperature and pressure. The defect-rich, few-layered structure exposes numerous active sites, promoting the formation of high -oxidation state Ni species at low overpotentials. Additionally, the introduction of Mn facilitates Ni oxidation and stabilizes in-situ formed NiOOH species. The optimized f-NiMn-LDH catalyst exhibits compelling UOR activity, requiring only 1.310/1.330/ 1.387 V for 10/100/400 mA cm -2 UOR, respectively. When used directly in urea-assisted hydrogen production, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.436 V for a high current density of 100 mA cm -2, representing a substantial 249 mV reduction compared to water electrolysis.

Here, we constructed a RuO2 nanoparticle (NPs)-modified NiSx/C3N4 nanoarray heterostructure (Ru/NiSx/ C3N4) on a nickel foam (NF) substrate using a combination of impregnation and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. This catalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA & sdot;cm- 2 at an ultralow potential of 1.27 VRHE in alkaline UOR. The Ru/NiSx/C3N4 exhibits lower overpotential and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) than the pristine NiSx/C3N4 array, indicating its superior kinetic performance. Combined in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that in situ generated Ni3+ (NiOOH) is the actual active site for UOR, while the high-valence Ru delta+ serves as an adsorption center for OH- ions, preventing competitive adsorption between OH- and urea molecules at the NiOOH site on the surface of the pristine NiSx/ C3N4 array structure, thereby reducing the adsorption Gibbs free energy (Delta G) of UOR intermediates.

Herein, novel york-shell-structural Ni2P/C nanosphere hybrids (Ni2P/C-YS) are rationally constructed via a hydrothermal method and subsequent phosphidation treatment under different temperature ranging from 250 degrees C to 450 degrees C for UOR applications. In the in-situ constructed hollow york-shell structure, the coupling of conductive carbon materials and active Ni2P allows numerous interfaces facilitating the electron transfer and thereby accelerating the catalytic kinetics.

Using urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can reduce the potential at anode and simultaneously purify the nitrogen-containing wastewater. Herein, the carbon encapsulated Ni-WO2 hybrids self-supported on nickel foam [denoted as (Ni-WO2)@C/NF] is synthesized via a hydrothermal method and then annealing in high temperature. The physicochemical characterizations indicate that the Ni-WO2 hybrids are encapsulated by carbon layer and the particles are evenly dispersed on the surface of nickel foam. It only needs a potential of 1.31 V and -77 mV for UOR and HER to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), exhibited outstanding catalytic activity. Furthermore, it only requires 1.38 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall urea oxidation and lasting 80 h at 80 mA cm(-2) without attenuation, highlighting the stability. This good performance could be originated from the synergistic effect between nickel and tungsten oxide, the carbon-encapsulated and the self-supported structure.

J	Fan, C; Wang, K; Hu, RH; Wang, YQ				Fan, Chao; Wang, Kang; Hu, Ruihang; Wang, Yan-Qin			Mo-CoP/Yb2O3 Heterostructure for Boosted Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction and Urea/Hydrazine Oxidation-Assisted Processes	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS												The development of highly efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important and urgent. Herein, a heterostructured electrocatalyst Mo-CoP/Yb2O3 was fabricated between Mo-doped CoP and rare-earth oxide Yb2O3. Mo-CoP/Yb2O3 not only displays outstanding HER activity but also exhibits outstanding urea oxidation and hydrazine oxidation activity, for which the HER activity is indicated by the low overpotential values of 33 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mV at 100 mA cm-2, the urea oxidation performance with the potential of 1.449 V vs RHE at 100 mA cm-2, and the hydrazine oxidation performance with the potential of 0.153 V vs RHE at 100 mA cm-2. Further, when Mo-CoP/Yb2O3 was used as both the cathode and anode for urea-assisted hydrogen production (cell voltage of 1.513 V at 100 mA cm-2) and hydrazine oxidation-assisted hydrogen production (cell voltage of 0.253 V at 100 mA cm-2), it is economically advantageous. The results show that Mo-doped CoP plays a significant role in the catalytic process, while the incorporation of Yb2O3 can enhance the catalyst's hydrophilicity and increase the water adsorption, potentially aiding in water splitting. Besides, the synergistic effect of Mo doping and heterostructure regulates the electronic structure and facilitates the electron transfer, thus improving the HER activity of Mo-CoP/Yb2O3.																			2574-0962					DEC 7	2024	7	24					12103	12111		10.1021/acsaem.4c02682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.4c02682		DEC 2024											WOS:001372138000001

Specifically, the produced 1.0 NCNOx exhibited outstanding catalytic activity in a Plasma co-catalysis system (T90 = 251 degrees C), which is 32 degrees C lower than that of CNOx (T90 = 283 degrees C), along with strong stability and water resistance during prolonged operation and exposure to water vapor. Experimental results showed that heat treatment with urea enhanced the catalyst's redox capacity by promoting the formation of high-valent Co and Ni species and increasing the amount of reactive oxygen species on its surface. This paper proposes a novel technique for developing efficient toluene catalytic oxidation catalysts through urea treatment, providing a theoretical foundation for the design of nonprecious metal catalysts.

Enhanced electrocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride-supported Ni/NiO microflower structures for urea electro-oxidation	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												BACKGROUNDIn this study, a 3D heterostructure of Ni/NiO microflower-decorated graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with different ratios was synthesized using the hydrothermal method. The aim was to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of these materials toward urea electrochemical oxidation (UEO) and compare them with various Ni-based catalysts in NaOH solution.RESULTSThe crystal structure and morphology of the synthesized electrocatalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Among the different ratios studied, the Ni/NiO 30%/g-C3N4 nanocomposites exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity and stability. The anodic current density of Ni/NiO 30%/g-C3N4 was approximately 1.5 times higher than that of NiO microflowers, indicating its superior capability for facilitating the electro-oxidation of urea at its surface. Furthermore, the Ni/NiO 30%/g-C3N4 composition showed a lower Tafel slope, low charge transfer resistance, and higher current density, making it a promising material for urea fuel cells.CONCLUSIONThe results of this study highlight the significance of the Ni/NiO 30%/g-C3N4 composition in achieving efficient electrocatalytic activity for UEO. The 3D heterostructure design, combining the synergistic effects of Ni/NiO and g-C3N4, offers enhanced performance and stability. These findings contribute to the development of advanced electrocatalysts for urea fuel cells, with potential applications in energy conversion systems. Further research should focus on optimizing the composition and exploring the underlying mechanisms to improve the performance of these electrocatalysts for practical applications.

In this paper, the effects of Zr introduction on formation of NiFe2O4 and catalytic activity are studied. Using oxygen evolution and urea oxidation as concerned reactions, the effects of different dosage on the catalytic performance of the materials were performed. It was found that the Zr-NiFe LDH@NiFe2O4/NF-1 material exhibited superior water oxidation properties (overpotential of 290 mV @100 mA cm- 2). For urea oxidation reaction, the catalytic performance of this NiFe LDH material is better at low current density. However, at high current densities, this Zr-NiFe LDH@NiFe2O4/NF-1 electrode exhibits better electrochemistry performance. It is proved that the oxidation of water also contributes a part of the activity under large current. Density functional theory also suggests that the NiFe2O4 material is favorable for water adsorption. This work will provide novel opinion for the development of environmentally friendly and low cost materials.																			0360-3199	1879-3487				SEP 4	2024	81						615	623		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.07.324	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.07.324		JUL 2024											WOS:001283454200001

Improved electrocatalytic kinetics of nickel hydroxide nanoparticles on Vulcan XC-72R carbon black towards alkaline urea oxidation reaction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Nickel hydroxide nanoparticles were fabricated on Vulcan XC-72R carbon black using various reducing agents through assisted microwave polyol process. The formed electrocatalysts using sodium borohydride [Ni(OH)(2)/C-NB], ethylene glycol [Ni(OH)(2)/C-EG] and a mixture of them [Ni(OH)(2)/C-NB] displayed an electrocatalytic activity towards urea oxidation in NaOH solution. The oxidation peak potential and current density values were greatly influenced by the employed reducing agent. Lower onset and peak potential values were measured at Ni(OH)(2)/C-EGNB, while Ni(OH)(2)/C-EG exhibited the highest oxidation current density during urea oxidation reaction. Electroactive surface area measurements revealed that the number of available active sites for the oxidation reaction was arranged in an ascending order as Ni(OH)(2)/C-NB < Ni(OH)(2)/C-EGNB < Ni(OH)(2)/C-EG. The diffusion coefficient of urea molecules at Ni(OH)(2)/C-EG and Ni(OH)(2)/C-EGNB was 14.69 and 5.90 times higher than that at Ni(OH)2/C-NB. Stable performance was measured at all studied electrocatalysts over prolonged operation suggesting their valuable application as efficient anode materials in direct urea oxidation fuel cells.

The amination method involves a covalent grafting of urea molecules onto the surface of acid treated multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-A) using O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl) N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) as the coupling agent. Platinum nanoparticles are impregnated on the surface of MWCNTs-U using NaBH4 . Pt/MWCNTs-U shows an enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability with exposing larger accessible surface area and 27% higher active surface area compared to Pt/MWCNTs-A. In addition, urea incorporation can improve the electrocatalyst tolerance against CO-poisoning, due to the enhanced formation kinetics of the chemisorbed hydroxyl groups. The onset potential of COads , oxidation indicates a decrease from 553 mV to 530 mV for Pt/MWCNTs-A and Pt/MWCNTs-U, respectively. It is observed that in the presence of amide group the forward peak current density and exchange current density, in CV and LSV experiments, respectively increase from 378 to 515 mA/mgp t and 1.59 x 10(-8) A/Cm-2 to 2.12 x 10(-8) A/Cm-2 . These results are also in a good agreement with the theoretical activation energies obtained from Arrhenius plots, indicating a decrease from 41.7 to 38.8 kJ/mol methanol in the case of Pt/MWCNTs-A and Pt/MWCNTs-U, respectively.

Insights into the Electrochemical Behavior and Kinetics of NiP@PANI/rGO as a High-Performance Electrode for Alkaline Urea Oxidation	ELECTROCATALYSIS												Efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst materials are highly in demand for energy generation from small organic materials. Herein, we developed polyaniline (PANI)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (PANI/rGO) as an efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst support material to improve the efficiency of nickel phosphide (NiP) for alkaline urea oxidation via a combination of facile solvothermal method and simple ultrasonic/heat mediated dispersion process. The synthesized electrode material was characterized using HRSEM, XRD, ART-FTIR, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and TGA. The physical characterization revealed the multifaceted phases and microspherical NiP with a particle size of 2.44 mu m and dispersed NiP on the surface of support materials. Furthermore, the electrochemical activities of synthesized electrode materials towards alkaline urea oxidation were tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical study depicts the higher performance of NiP@PANI/rGO in terms of low onset potential (0.292 V), anodic peak potential of 0.427 V to drive a high current density of 15.76 mAcm(-2), high electrochemically active surface area (18.29 cm(2)mg(-1)), and high stability towards alkaline urea electro-oxidation compared with pristine NiP and NiP@rGO. These significant efficiency improvements of NiP can be ascribed by the synergetic effect between PANI and rGO and higher immobilization of NiP particles on as-synthesized PANI/rGO support material due to strong interaction between Ni2+ and -N.H.-fragments of PANI. Therefore, the higher electrochemical performance of a novel electrode material NiP@PANI/rGO would be a promising candidate for alkaline urea electro-oxidation in direct urea fuel cell applications.

Ni&Mn nanoparticles-decorated carbon nanofibers are introduced as effective and stable electrocatalysts for urea oxidation. The introduced decorated carbon nanofibers were synthesized by calcination of electrospun mats composed of nickel acetate, manganese acetate and poly(vinyl alcohol) in argon atmosphere at 850 degrees C. The utilized characterization techniques, XRD, TEM, FE SEM and TEM-EDX analyses, confirmed formation of carbon nanofibers decorated by discrete Ni, Mn and NiMn nanoparticles and absence of any oxides. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the introduced nanofibers have good electrocatalytic activity toward urea oxidation as the observed current density was 300 mAcm(-2) g(-1) with an onset potential of 290 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). Moreover, the results proved that incorporation of manganese and the nanofibrous morphology distinctly enhance the electrocatalytic activity of nickel toward urea oxidation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, nickel sulfide was encapsulated in carbon via calcining the mixture of mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres and glucose at 550 ?C. NiS2 was not stable at high temperature, it would be spontaneously decomposed into NiS debris and partly reduced to metallic Ni. When used as catalyst for urea electro-oxidation, the Ni-NiS@C with core-shell structure exhibited superior catalytic performance. Although the carbon shell itself had no catalytic activity towards urea electro-oxidation, it had a great promoting effect. The confinement effect of carbon shell could effectively tune the electronic properties of Ni species, the good electrical conductivity of carbon could decrease electron-transfer resistance, and the existence of carbon could protect the nickel sulfide debris against severe aggregation. Moreover, carbon could promote the formation of metallic Ni which also played a significant role to improve urea electro-oxidation performance. Therefore, Ni-NiS@C exhibited much higher catalytic activity and stability towards urea electro-oxidation compared with NiS2 and NiS without carbon shell.

Here, we report a controllable synthetic strategy to develop CuO-Ni(OH)2-d nanosheets by deliberately selecting S2O32-as the coordinating etchant toward to Cu2O template and optimize the reaction conditions. The CuO-Ni(OH)2-d is composed of CuO quadrangle nanosheets (100-200 nm) dispersed with Ni (OH)2 nanoparticles. As predicted, The CuO-Ni(OH)2-d nanosheets catalysts exhibit high UOR activities at 1.41 V vs. RHE to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 under the condition of 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. The CuO-Ni(OH)2-d nanosheets catalyst also emerges a higher current density of 21.5 mA cm-2, which is about 5.3, 6.8, 30, and 2 times larger than those of commercial Ni(OH)2, CuO-Ni(OH)2-a, CuO-Ni(OH)2-b and CuO-Ni(OH)2c at 1.52 V vs. RHE, respectively. In particular, the CuO-Ni(OH)2-d nanosheets catalysts exhibited the best catalytic stability performance. After the 36 h I-T test, the current density has no noticeable decreasing compared with the initial current density.

In this study, two Ni containing materials of nickel-aluminum layered double hydroxides (NiAl-LDH) and metal organic framework (Ni-MOF) were synthesized and compared with Ni disk towards urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Physical characterization proved the existence of Ni with the same valence of +2 in the as-prepared catalysts. Moreover, the electrochemical analysis showed that more active Ni centers with surface concentrations of 1.01 x 10(-6) and 1.17 x 10(-6) mol cm(-2) existed in both NiAl-LDH and Ni-MOF, which was significant higher than Ni disk of 3.74 x 10(-7 )mol cm(-2). Moreover, Ni-MOF was found to be a better catalyst due to its lower activated energy, tafel slope & overpotential as well as higher stable current density and turnover frequency (TOF) value than NiAl-LDH. This phenomenon might be explained by the protection of Ni2+ by the lattice of layered double hydroxides, which led to an obstacle for its transformation to Ni3+ and thus obviously hindered UOR.

In response, NiSx-VS4-C is synthesized via a facile glycerol coking strategy in hydrothermal system. It is found that NiSx-VS4-C is composed of many nanoparticles with a relatively small size (approximately 70 nm). Besides acting as the precursor of carbon, glycerol can regulate the morphology and structure of catalysts, and promote the formation of vacancy defects. Using as catalyst for UOR, a specific current activity of 652 mA cm(-2) mg(-1) for NiSx-VS4-C can be achieved at 0.52 V (vs. Hg/HgO), which is much higher than that for NiSx or VS4 synthesized in glycerol solution. Glycerol coking is important for boosting catalytic activity. NiSx-VS4-C synthesized in glycerol solution exhibits much better catalytic activity than that synthesized in other alcohol solutions. Potential dependent impedance analyses reveal that urea indirect electro-oxidation mechanism should be mainly obeyed when NiSx-VS4-C is employed as catalyst. Both Ni and V with high chemical valence are active sites, where Ni species is mainly in charge of the oxidation of amine intermediate and V species is mainly in charge of the oxidation of CO intermediate. Carbon, especially graphitized phase, will significantly enhance the electrical conductivity and accelerate the charge transfer process. Therefore, constructing dual active sites and enhancing electrical conductivity via polyalcohol coking provide promising strategies for Ni-based catalysts towards UOR.					liu, zirui/HNK-6782-2023; Lv, Yanping/GLS-2340-2022														0925-8388	1873-4669				DEC 15	2024	1008								176743	10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.176743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.176743		SEP 2024											WOS:001329421700001

Fabrication of efficient and stable electrocatalysts is a crucial factor in H2 yield and energy conversion efficiency. Herein, we propose a synergistic engineering route to develop the heteroatom-doped Ni2P-Ni12P5 heterojunction on the porous carbon as the electrocatalyst via the simple solution combustion method. The shift of the diffraction peaks, the change of the lattice spacing, and the difference in the electronic distribution indicate that Cu or Mn heteroatoms are successfully doped into the heterojunction Ni2P-Ni12P5 structure, not only promoting the formation of the Ni3+ but also accelerating the electron transfer. As a result, the doping of Cu and Mn into the Ni2P-Ni12P5 heterojunction obtains high-performance electrocatalysts for the UOR. The Mn doping enhances the catalytic performance of the parent Ni2P-Ni12P5 heterostructure, achieving the potential of 1.319 V at 100 mA.cm(-2) in UOR. Moreover, the Cu-doped Ni2P-Ni12P5 heterojunction catalyst shows a low potential of 1.318 V at 100 mA.cm(-2) and demonstrates exceptional long-term stability under different current densities. Notably, when this catalyst is employed in the two-electrode cell for urea-assisted water electrolysis, the hydrogen production readily occurs at the voltage of 1.47 V for reaching 100 mA.cm(-2), manifesting the electrocatalyst with high activity and stability to be a promising candidate for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production on the industrial scale.

Herein, we highlighted a defect engineering strategy to design oxygen vacancy-rich NiMoO4 nanosheets as a promising platform to study the relationship between O vacancies and UOR activity. Experimental/theoretical results confirm that the rich O vacancies confined in NiMoO4 nanosheets successfully bring synergetic effects of higher exposed active sites, faster electron transport, and lower adsorption energy of urea molecules, giving rise to largely improved UOR activity. As expected, the r-NiMoO4/NF 3D electrode exhibits a higher current density of 249.5 mA cm(-2), which is about 1.9 and 5.0 times larger than those of p-NiMoO4/NF and Ni-Mo precursor/NF at a potential of 0.6 V.

Dialysate Regeneration with Urea Selective Membrane Coupled to Photoelectrochemical Oxidation System	ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES												Portable dialysis can meaningfully improve the health outcomes and life quality of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and reduce the economic burdens of dialysis related care. Current treatment sessions use 120 Kg of aqueous dialysate, thus key to realizing portability is the continuous regeneration of small volumes of spent dialysate. Urea is the single most abundant uremic waste. However, its removal is compromised from the interference of other uremic species. Osmotic membranes demonstrate high selectivity of urea over other uremic species in both reverse and forward osmosis (FO) modes. In FO mode, a urea mass transport coefficient of 1.2 mu m s(-1) is seen, corresponding to a diffusion coefficient of 1.2 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1). By using a second stage dialyzer with a commercially available FO cartridge, daily urea removal rate of over 30 g, twice the daily generation rate, could be achieved at a dialysate flow rate of 400 mL min(-1). Combined with an optimized urea photodecomposition device, selective removal of urea (0.32 mg cm(-2) h(-1)) and excessive water (0.081 g cm(-2) h(-1)) are achieved simultaneously thus scaling to 2000 cm(2) electrode area for clinical needs of 15 g urea removal/day. No significant difference in the cytotoxicity between treated and untreated human spent dialysate is observed.

However, the overpotential of the UOR is still high due to the complicated 6e(-) transfer process and adsorption/desorption of intermediate products. Herein, utilizing a cation exchange strategy, Ni-doped CuO nanoarrays grown on 3D Cu foam are synthesized. Notably, Ni-CuO NAs/CF requires a low potential of 1.366 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode to drive a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), outperforming various benchmark electrocatalysts and maintaining robust stability in alkaline media. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that Ni as the driving force center can effectively enhance the urea adsorption and stabilize CO*/NH* intermediates toward the UOR.

Below, we report a hollow NiS@Ni2P nanoframe heterostructure that works well as a substitute catalyst for the urea oxidation and general water splitting reactions. The hollow NiS@Ni2P nanoframe was synthesized by ion exchange, sulfurization and phosphat-ing, which is favorable for achieving a heterostructure. The NiS@Ni2P catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and strong long-term stability in 1.0 M KOH solutions for the hydrogen evolution reaction, which needs 121 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2. And for the oxygen evolution reaction, the catalyst needs 311 mV to acquire 50 mA cm-2. These advantages come from the optimal electronic structural configuration, hierarchical hollow nanoframe structure, and large surface area. It could attain 10 mA cm-2 at 1.41 V when utilized as a urea oxidation reaction anode, which is lower than the oxygen evolution reaction. For total water splitting and urea oxidation process, NiS@Ni2P as a bifunctional catalyst holds tremendous promise due to its strong electrocatalytic activity, ease of manufacture, and low cost of raw ingredients.(c) 2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

NiCo LDH with NO3- intercalant exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance and selectivity toward urea oxidation with a low onset potential, high faradaic efficiency, and high durability.

An immersion-selenization strategy was proposed to prepare CoSe2/Co nanorods anchored on Co foam as bifunctional catalysts for OER and UOR. Due to the self-supported properties of CoSe2/Co and its unique nanorod structure, the OER activity is enhanced, showing an overpotential of 318 mV and a Tafel slope of 91.11 mV dec(-1). In addition, the electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic UOR activity with an overpotential of 260 mV and a Tafel slope of 94.83 mV dec(-1).

The CoNiHCF reduces the peak-to-peak separation of the cyclic voltammo-grams for Ni2+/Ni3+ couple, which favors the reversible regeneration of active Ni3+ species. NiHCF, a kind of Prussian blue analogue, has greater UOR kinetics than nickel foam and CoHCF, due to its open framework structure with redox-active nickel and iron species. The hollow core-shell architecture affords numerous path-ways for fast electron and electrolyte transport, enhancing the adsorption and oxidation of urea molecules on the catalytic Ni3+ sites. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals superior UOR kinetics of CoNiHCF compared to the NiHCF catalyst, reflected by its low electrical resistance, charge-transfer resistance, and direct UOR resistance. The CoHCF core in the CoNiHCF provides a conductive host to immobilize the nickel-rich catalyst shell to promote the formation of high-valence species Ni3+ to boost the electrocatalytic activity of the CoNiHCF. The CoNiHCF catalyst exhibits a high oxidation current (175 mA cm-2 at 1.570 V), small onset potential (1.335 V), and remarkable durability, rendering it a highly promising catalyst material for UOR.						zhan, yu xin/0000-0001-6353-8551													0013-4686	1873-3859				DEC 20	2023	472								143427	10.1016/j.electacta.2023.143427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2023.143427		NOV 2023											WOS:001108716800001

Herein, a novel electrocatalyst composed of amorphous Ni (OH)S nanosheets was prepared by hydrolysis of NiCl2(CH3CSNH2)4 at room temperature. From spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Ni(OH)S catalyst contains a Ni3+-rich phase, which can significantly accelerate the reaction kinetics. The anode electrocatalyst shows excellent OER activity, generating 10 mA cm-2 with only 250 mV overpotentials. When employed as a UOR anode, it could reach 10 mA cm-2 at 1.34 V, 140 mV lower than OER. Notably, the Ni(OH)S/NF anode exhibits decent bifunctional UOR and OER activities and presents the lowest overpotentials compared to a NiFe-PBA/NF UOR catalyst and a typical RuO2/NF OER catalyst. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing amorphous Ni (III)-based sulfides nanosheets for bifunctional OER/UOR electrocatalysts, which is significant for efficient and stable hydrogen production by using urea-containing wastewater.

In addition, the urea electro-oxidation process is a mixed control of diffusion and kinetic limitation, as demonstrated by the effects of scan rate on the peak current density and peak potential. Subsequently, the impact of diffusion for the different catalysts varies with the change of Ni loading, which is verified by experiments. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

A lower charge-transfer resistance of 3.3cm(2) at 0.40V was calculated on Ni60Cr40/C compared to that on Ni/C (13cm(2)). The exceptionally high mass activity of Ni60Cr40/C is attributed to its improved charge-transfer kinetics, enhanced surface coverage of Ni-II/Ni-III redox center, better dispersion of Ni nuclei, and a low-Tafel slope.

Herein, we report the growth of Ni5P4 nanosheets on nickel foam as bifunctional electrode (CA-Ni5P4@NiOx/NF) for urea electrolysis. The results indicated that a thin layer of amorphous NiOx formed on the surface of Ni5P4 nanosheets to yield a unique crystalline@amorphous core-shell structure, which can be maintained during long time urea electrolysis. The outstanding UOR performance of CA-Ni5P4@NiOx/NF was attributed to the unique structure, which not only combine the good conductivity and abundant active sites, but also rendered the CA-Ni5P4@NiOx/NF superhydrophilic and aerophobic that significantly facilities the release of gases bubbles formed during UOR to avoid the blockage of the active sites. As a result, the CA-Ni5P4@NiOx/NF electrode exhibited excellent performance for UOR, which only needs 1.45 V (vs. RHE) to deliver a current of 100 mA/cm2. When used as anode for direct urea fuel cell (DUFC), it could reach a maximal power density as high as 3.4 mW/cm2 with an OCV of 0.76 V. The CA-Ni5P4@NiOx/NF also exhibited excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with -0.089 V (vs. RHE) to deliver a current of 10 mA/cm2. The electrolyzer constructed with CA-Ni5P4@NiOx as both anode and cathode could run for more than 10 h at a high current load about 100 mA/cm2 without appreciable potential change, indicating the superb stability of the CA-Ni5P4@NiOx electrode. Our work provides new insights for understanding as well as the development of advanced electrode for DUFC and urea electrolysis.

To address the limitations posed by the self-oxidation of nickel-based catalysts on the activity of UOR, we here developed a NiCo LDH nanosheet catalyst with abundant Ni vacancies to initiate the UOR process prior to nickel oxidation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and In-situ spectroscopic characterizations confirm that the UOR process primarily occurs on the surface of the catalyst, rather than being driven by nickel oxidation products. The favorable electronic structure modulation induced by Ni vacancies makes the catalyst more energetically favorable for the UOR compared to nickel self-oxidation. The catalyst exhibits excellent UOR activity, only requiring 1.27 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) and 1.34 V vs. RHE at 100 mA cm(-2), with no significant decay observed after over 120 h of operation. Furthermore, it can function as a bifunctional catalyst, requiring only 1.66 V to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) for the UOR parallel to HER system. This study expands the pathway for the application of cationic vacancies in UOR.					刘, 西军/HNP-3746-2023	Zhang, Xubin/0000-0002-1660-3813													1385-8947	1873-3212				NOV 15	2024	500								156766	10.1016/j.cej.2024.156766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.156766		OCT 2024											WOS:001343494100001

However, DUFCs still suffer from the sluggish kinetics of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) owing to a 6 e(-) transfer process, which poses a severe hindrance to their practical use.

Surface sulfur incorporation successfully brings synergetic effects of more exposed active sites, good wetting behavior, and effective electron transport, giving rise to greatly enhanced performance for UOR. Metallic nanosheets exhibited a much higher current density, smaller onset potential and stronger durability.					zhao, jiyin/F-3247-2013; Xie, Yi/B-5753-2009; Tao, Shi/M-1867-2018; An, Xingda/IRZ-0232-2023; zhu, xiaojiao/HSE-7507-2023; Wu, Changzheng/F-1784-2010; Dai, Jun/A-6559-2011; Guo, Yuqiao/C-4168-2014; Zhang, Lidong/A-9793-2012; Zeng, Xiao Cheng/C-1590-2013	zhu, xiaojiao/0000-0002-8128-9402; An, Xingda/0000-0002-7484-7410; Wu, Changzheng/0000-0002-4416-6358; Dai, Jun/0000-0001-6599-8826; Guo, Yuqiao/0000-0002-5031-5495; Zhang, Lidong/0000-0002-4924-1927; Zeng, Xiao Cheng/0000-0003-4672-8585													1433-7851	1521-3773				SEP 26	2016	55	40					12465	12469		10.1002/anie.201606313	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201606313								27572334					WOS:000384713700060

In this study, M (M = Fe, Cr, Mo)-Ni3S2/Co3S4 composites with rich heterogeneous interfaces were prepared on Ni foam substrate through conventional hydrothermal vulcanization technique. The prepared Mo-Ni3S2/Co3S4 electrode showed excellent urea oxidation activity with a current density of 50 mA/cm2 at a potential of 1.38 V. The experimental data demonstrate that the high catalytic performance of this catalyst is due to its superior charge transfer, more active center exposure and good electron transportability. Density functional theory analysis revealed that the Mo-Ni3S2 segment accelerated the reaction process during the electrochemistry process, the introduction of Co3S4 segment improved the conductivity of the electrode, and the synergistic effect of Co3S4 and Mo-Ni3S2 made the Mo-Ni3S2/Co3S4 electrode present superior urea oxidation performance. This study proposes a novel direction for the exploration of both environmentally friendly and robust sulfide-based urea oxidation electrodes.																			0016-2361	1873-7153				NOV 15	2024	376								132749	10.1016/j.fuel.2024.132749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.132749		AUG 2024											WOS:001293253600001

However, the side reaction oxygen evolution reaction (OER) originating from the competitive adsorption of OHand urea severely limited the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity on the alloy catalysts. This work successfully constructs the defect -rich NiCo alloy with lattice strain (PMo-NiCo/NF) by rapid pyrolysis and co -doping. By taking advantage of the compressive strain, the d -band center of NiCo is shifted downward, inhibiting OHfrom adsorbing on the NiCo site and avoiding the detrimental OER. Meanwhile, the oxygenophilic P/Mo tailored specific adsorption sites to adsorb OHpreferentially, which further released the NiCo sites to ensure the enriched adsorption of urea, thus improving the UOR efficiency. As a result, PMo-NiCo/NF only requires 1.27 V and -57 mV to drive a current density of +/- 10 mA cm -2 for UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. With the guidance of this work, reactant competing adsorption sites could be tailored for effective electrocatalytic performance.

Consequently, highly-efficient and earth-abundant electrocatalysts are attracting considerable attention. Herein we report a bifunctional Ni-Mo alloy nanotube for efficient hydrogen production coupled with anodic urea oxidation in a hybrid water electrolysis system. Specifically, ultralow potentials of - 44 mV and 1.36 V (vs. RHE) are required to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density for cathodic and anodic reactions, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show the Mo center is the main reaction site for the chemisorption and O-H bond cleavage of H2O while Ni center is identified as the hydrogen-evolving site. Based on this bifunctional Ni-Mo electrocatalyst, a hybrid water electrolysis cell is proposed and the overall cell voltage of similar to 1.43 V is achieved for outputting 10 mA cm(-2) current density during the 10 h operation. The understandings in alternative electrode reactions coupled with highly-efficient and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for hybrid water electrolysis in this work holds encouraging potential in future energy conversion technologies and urea-related water treatments.

J	He, JT				He, Jingting			Role of Zr in promoted activity of urea oxidation reaction and oxygen evolution reaction for NiFe layered double hydroxide	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Electrolysis of water and splitting of urea to produce hydrogen are identified as one of the most attractive approach to reduce environmental pollution. However, this approach is both promising and challenging. In the paper, the NiFeZr LDH material was in situ grown on Ni foam through a one-step hydrothermal process. The electrochemistry activity of the NiFeZr LDH electrode was investigated by two probe reactions, one for the oxidation of urea and the other for the oxidation of water. It is worth mentioning that whether it is the oxidation reaction of urea (potential of 1.42 V @ 10 mA cm-2) or water (overpotential of 350 mV @ 10 mA cm-2), the doping of Zr improves the catalytic activity of the material. What is worth mentioning that the oxidation of urea does significantly decrease energy consumption compared to the oxidation of water. However, experiments show that the catalytic active sites are different in the two reactions. We speculate that iron is the active site for the oxidation of water, while zirconium is the active site for the oxidation of urea. Experiments demonstrate that the promoted performance is assigned to the exposure of the centre site, the rapid charge transfer rate and the improved electron configuration. Density functional theory analysis indicates that this NiFeZr LDH electrode presents optimal adsorption energy for urea, which improves the catalytic activity of the material.																			0360-3199	1879-3487				FEB 29	2024	57						929	938		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.018		JAN 2024											WOS:001160830600001

However, the sluggish anodic reaction imposes a considerable overpotential requirement. By contrast, the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction offers the prospect of energy saving H2 production together with urea-rich wastewater purification. In this work, a 0D/2D Co3O4/Ti3C2 MXene composite was synthesized by a simple solution reaction approach under mild conditions and applied as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in basic medium (1 M KOH+0.5 M urea). The Co3O4/Ti3C2 MXene electrodes delivered a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 124 mV for HER and required 1.40 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 for UOR. The hybrid catalyst could maintain high activity after 40 h continuous catalytic reaction for both UOR and HER. Its catalytic performance was significantly improved compared to that of pure Ti3C2 MXene and Co3O4 solving the problem of insufficient exposure of active sites caused by too large particle size and agglomeration of Co3O4 particles. Notably, Co3O4/Ti3C2 MXene was applied as a bifunctional catalyst for overall urea-containing water splitting, and showed certain energy saving advantages compared with other reported Co-based catalysts. This work provides a strategy for application other than noble metal-based electrode materials for urea-containing wastewater purification coupled with H2 production.					mohamed, eman/GPX-5871-2022; Zhang, Zhaohui/KCY-5668-2024; ROUSSEL, Pascal/A-8578-2011; Boukherroub, Rabah/I-4826-2017; Addad, Yacine/JPA-5011-2023	WANG, Qi/0000-0001-6518-8444; Szunerits, Sabine/0000-0002-1567-4943; zhang, zhaohui/0000-0001-9679-1035; Roussel, Pascal/0000-0001-7243-7293; ahmed, addad/0000-0002-5514-0567; ZHANG, Yi/0000-0002-7596-0706													2574-0962					DEC 26	2022	5	12					15471	15482		10.1021/acsaem.2c03052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.2c03052		DEC 2022											WOS:000897599000001

Unfortunately, urea oxidation reaction (UOR) involves a complex six-electron transfer process leading to high overpotential, which forces researchers to develop high-performance UOR catalysts to drive the development of urea-assisted water splitting. Based on the UOR mechanism and extensive literature research, this review summarizes the strategies for preparing highly efficient UOR catalysts. First, the UOR mechanism is introduced and the characteristics of excellent UOR catalysts are pointed out. Aiming at this, the following modulation strategies are proposed to improve the catalytic performance based on summarizing various literature: 1) Accelerating the active phase formation to reduce initial potential; 2) Creating double active sites to trigger a new UOR mechanism; 3) Accelerating urea adsorption and promoting CN bond cleavage to ensure the effective conduct of UOR; 4) Promoting the desorption of CO2 to improve stability and prevent catalyst poisoning; 5) Promoting electron transfer to overcome the inherent slow dynamics of UOR; 6) Increasing active sites or active surface area. Then, the application of UOR in electrochemical devices is summarized. Finally, the current deficiencies and future directions are discussed.

Herein, a multilayer hole amorphous boron-nickel catalyst (a-NiBx) is fabricated through a simple chemical plating method, which displays intriguing catalytic activity toward UOR, demanding a low working potential of 1.4 V to reach 100 mA cm-2. The high performance is credited to the formation of metaborate (BO2-), which can promote the formation of high-oxidation-state NiOOH active phase and optimize the adsorption of urea molecules. This can be confirmed by the operando spectroscopy characteristics and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, the assembled electrolyzer utilizing NiBx as bifunctional catalysts exhibited splendid catalytic activity, requiring an evidently lower voltage of 1.66 V to reach a current density of 100 mA cm-2 and 1.57 V when using Pt/C as a cathode catalyst. Moreover, the assembled electrolyzer secured a robust stability of over 200 h, as well as a four times higher hydrogen production rate than traditional water electrolysis. An amorphous boron-nickel catalyst is synthesized using a simple and fast chemical plating method, replacing the traditional OER with a urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for hydrogen production. The excellent UOR performance is attributed to the in situ generated BO2- on the surface, which is responsible for the rapid formation of the NiOOH active phase and optimizing the absorption of urea molecules. image					焦, 丽芳/G-4953-2015; Wang, Tongzhou/AAT-5332-2021; Shao, Li/ABG-1493-2021														1616-301X	1616-3028				DEC	2024	34	52								10.1002/adfm.202411011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202411011		SEP 2024											WOS:001312715700001

Exploiting low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts to accelerate the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) does make sense as it can relieve not only energy shortage but also the water contamination problems. In this work, the Ni3S2 nanosheets grown on the Ni foam with different amounts of Mn2+ doping were developed as useful electrocatalysts toward UOR. The experimental and computational methods were performed to explore the properties of obtained samples. We found that the doping of Mn2+ could distinctly regulate the charge distribution of Ni3S2 by which the performance was observably optimized. We also compared the behaviors of obtained catalysts with various dopant concentrations of Mn2+. Especially, Ni3S2 grown on the Ni foam with the addition of 0.2 mmol of Mn2+ exhibits splendid properties with a lower potential and superior longevity, which can achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of only 1.397 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in 1.0 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea solution, indicating that our findings can serve as promising electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis.

Herein, we successfully synthesized nickel-iron-cobalt diselenides on the nickel foam (NiFeCoSe2) by a one-step electrodeposition method. The as-prepared NiFeCoSe2 nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) exhibited significantly improved electrocatalytic performance and stability in a highly alkaline medium (1 M KOH) with and without 0.33 M urea. In particular, the obtained NiFeCoSe2 only requires a po-tential of 1.52 V (vs. RHE) for OER and 1.37 V (vs. RHE) for UOR to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2, along with a stability of 30 h. This was attributed to the unique interconnected nanosheets, binder-free in-situ selenium electrodeposition, synergistic effect, and strong electron interaction of Ni, Fe, Co, and Se elements.

Deciphering the activity origin and achieving rational structure design are pivotal for developing highly efficient electrocatalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, nitrogen penetrated nickel nanoparticles confined in carbon nanotubes (Ni-NCNT) is successfully achieved to drive UOR. Active origin of Ni-NCNT is decoded to be the in-situ generated Ni2+delta O(OH)(ads) according to comprehensive analysis. The electrophilic Ni2+delta and protophilic OHads could targeted capture O and H atoms from urea, respectively, achieving molecule activation and accelerating the subsequent proton coupled electron transfer reactions. Nitrogen penetration is identified to promote prior formation of Ni2+delta O(OH)(ads) and push up the d band center of Ni-NCNT, enhancing urea adsorption and subsequent molecule cleavage reactions. As a result, Ni-NCNT exhibits superior UOR performance. This work supplies valuable insights for the rational design and construction of efficient nickel-based catalyst for driving UOR.

However, the efficiency of UOR is hindered by the dehydrogenation of intermediate *CONH2NH and the conversion of toxic intermediate the *CO. Herein, we report a robust strategy to elevate UOR performance by introducing iron (Fe) atoms into the Ni3S2@NiSe2 heterojunctions (denoted Fe-Ni3S2@NiSe2). The Fe-Ni3S2@NiSe2 exhibits remarkable selectivity and electrocatalytic activity towards UOR, attributed to its reconstruction into Fe-NiOOH species during UOR process, as confirmed by in-situ Raman technology. Utilizing Fe-Ni3S2@NiSe2 as both the cathode and anode in a single-chamber electrolytic cell, the hydrogen production rate reaches 588.4 mu mol h(-1) in simulated urea-containing sewage and 432.1 mu mol h(-1) in actual human urine, respectively. Notably, in both scenarios, no oxygen product is detected, and the hydrogen production efficiency surpasses that of traditional water splitting by 5.8-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively. In-situ infrared spectroscopy study reveals that the UOR process involves the cleavage of C-N bond and the generation of CO2. Density functional theory calculations further signifies that the incorporation of Fe facilitates the dehydrogenation of *CONH2NH intermediates, strengthens the d-p hybridization, and weakens O-H bonds, thereby resulting in reduced energy barriers for UOR. Our strategy holds promise for efficient hydrogen production from sewage via UOR, offering potential implications for wastewater treatment and clean energy generation.					张, 颖贞/AAN-2152-2021; Li, Wang/JHU-1729-2023; Lin, Zhiqun/GPF-4115-2022; Hou, Tingting/LMN-6758-2024; Lai, Yuekun/A-9429-2010; Li, Yingwei/M-6479-2014; Huang, Jianying/U-9731-2018	Lai, Yuekun/0000-0003-4100-510X; Shen, Kui/0000-0002-4132-4533; Li, Yingwei/0000-0003-1527-551X; Huang, Jianying/0000-0003-0515-9523													0926-3373	1873-3883				SEP 15	2024	353								124064	10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124064		APR 2024											WOS:001325053500001

Modification of nickel foam with nickel phosphate catalyst layer via anodizing for boosting the electrocatalytic urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions	JOURNAL OF SAUDI CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are the key processes for implementing urinated water electrolysis and hydrogen green production, respectively. This contribution investigates the modification of commercial nickel foam (NF) with a nickel phosphate (NiPO/NF) heterostructure layer via anodizing in phosphate solution at various potentials (5, 10 and 15 V) as a simple and efficient route to boost the urea-assisted water electrolysis and hydrogen production in alkaline medium. The morphology and composition physicochemical characterisation of the phosphate layer exhibit aggregates of crystalline nanoparticles with interstitial mesoporous and macroporous networks with a mole composition ratio of 9.42: 1.0: 8.14 for Ni: P: O respectively. The electrochemical measurements revealed the NiPO/NF anodized at 10 V exhibits a superior electroactive surface area of 255 cm2, a substantially higher urea oxidation current compared to pristine NF, achieving 20 and 500 mA/cm2 at 1.35 and 1.6 V vs. RHE respectively and retained 100 % of activity during the urea electrolysis for more than 3 h. The electrochemical impedance analysis confirmed the alkaline urea oxidation reaction proceeded via indirect (EC) and direct mechanism and the CO2 intermediates adsorption-desorption became the predominant reaction at more positive potential. The NiPO/NF anode employed in an H-shape can deliver up to +/- 400 mA/cm2 for UOR/HER at a bias potential of 1.85 V and 8-fold (2.0 mmol/ min) much higher hydrogen production rate compared to the pristine NF anode (0.25 mmol/min). Combining commercial nickel foam modification via anodizing and alkaline urea electrolysis at ambient conditions offers a unique and innovative solution for both large-scale hydrogen green production as well as remedy of the urinated wastewater for a more sustainable future.

And urea and seawater, which are in large reserves and easily accessible, have become the mainstream electrolytes for hydrogen production. This paper reported the successful preparation of Co-doped Ni3Se2 heterostructured catalysts with MoS2 and Ni3S2 heterogeneous structure in details by selenization and sulfidation of reactive metal oxides with hydroxide precursors. The Co-Ni3Se2/MoS2/Ni3S2 target compounds showed excellent performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), requiring only the potential of 1.281 V at a current density of 10 mA & lowast;cm(-2) comparing with other catalysts while possessing a smaller Tafel slope as well as a larger double-layer capacitance, which was also reflected in impedance spectra. The result indicated that the target catalysts possessed a good urea oxidation reaction performance in all aspects. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance also performed equally well in seawater electrolyte, a current density of 10 mA & lowast;cm(-2) was achieved with only overpotential of 164 mV. It should be noted, however, that the material was not stable in the urea and seawater tests, and further optimization work is needed to improve the stability of the electrode. The adsorption energies of the electrode components for urea molecules were analyzed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to further reveal the importance of the heterogeneous structure of the electrode during the UOR reaction.

An efficient and non-precious anode electrocatalyst of NiO-modified carbon nanofibers towards electrochemical urea oxidation in alkaline media	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL												Non-precious NiO nanoparticles were combined with carbon fibers (CFs) to design the novel electrode material; NiO-CFs. The as-synthesized NiO-CFs material was investigated in terms of Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-vis spectra, Transmission electron microscope (TEM), selected area diffraction (SAED) pattern and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. These analyses indicate the successful synthesis of a nanocomposite of NiO-CFs. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in addition to chronoamperometric (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods were studied in the 3-electrodes system to examine the electrochemical performance of NiO-CFs material for urea oxidation in KOH medium. The synthesized nanocomposite showed improved electrochemical oxidation of urea at various urea concentrations up to 1.5 M. The decreasing of both charge transfer impedance and series resistance indicates the enhanced transfer of electrons in the occurrence of urea which could be related to the high electrochemical performance of NiO-CFs material as an electrocatalyst. The superior electrochemical activity can be due to the assembly of C-structure with NiO nanoparticles during the synthesis steps which enhance electrocatalysis, charge transfer, and structural defects.

In this work, the tomentum-like FeNi3-MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets array self-supported on nickel foam (NF) as bifunctional catalyst is prepared by facile hydrothermal and annealing method. Only 1.29 V and -50.8 mV is required to obtain +/- 10 mA cm(-2) for urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction (UOR and HER), respectively, showing great bifunctional catalytic activity. For overall urea electrolysis, it only needs 1.37 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and can last at 100 mA cm(-2) for 70 h without obvious activity attenuation, showing outstanding durability. Coupling interface constructions of FeNi3-MoO2 heterostructures, novel morphology with a mesoporous and self-supporting structure could be the reason for this good performance. This work thus proposes a promising catalyst for boosting UOR and HER to realize efficient overall urea electrolysis.

R.; Shim, Jaesool			Tailoring the composition of a non-noble, Cubic Shaped MnSn(OH)6 Bi-functional electrocatalysts for methanol and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solutions	SURFACES AND INTERFACES												A systematic study of the effect of Sn-precursor concentration on the composition of (MnSn(OH)(6)) is carried out, and the samples' structural, morphological, and electrochemical variations are investigated. Four different SnCl2 center dot 5H(2)O precursor concentrations (5, 10, 20, and 40 mM) are varied to synthesize MnSn(OH)(6) electrocatalysts, denoted as MS-1, MS-2, MS-3, and MS-4, respectively, using a hydrothermal method. All four samples' crystal structure and chemical states are identified using X-ray diffraction analysis and X-ray photoelectron microscopy. Morphological studies are carried out using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy studies. The electrocatalytic performance and the stability of the synthesized samples are evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Among the samples, MS-3, which has an optimized ratio of Mn/Sn, displayed the highest current density values of 80.3 mA g(-1) and 84.7 mA g(-1) at a higher potential of 0.7 V for the urea oxidation reaction in the presence of 0.33 M urea + 1.0 M KOH and for the methanol oxidation reaction in the presence of 0.5 M methanol + 1.0 M KOH, respectively. This intrinsic activity of MS-3 samples is due to its more significant electrochemically active surface area value of 208 mF cm(-2), primarily because of the dominance of Mn3+ on the surface. Furthermore, MS-3 displayed reduced overpotential, as evidenced by the onset potential of 1.45 (V vs RHE) @ 10 mA cm(-2), indicating enhanced electrocatalytic performance. These findings highlight the importance of tuning the Mn/Sn metal ratio to design and develop cost-effective non-precious electrocatalysts for urea and methanol oxidation reactions.

Different nitro-humification metrics, i.e., solubility, physicochemical properties, oxidation degree, nitrogen functionalization, spectral ratios, and surface functionalization, along with energy efficiency and economic profitability, were determined for the processed lignite. The best solubility metrics for the lignite were obtained under 3 wt% ozone, 10 wt% KOH, and 20 wt% urea. The selected conditions could increase alkali-and water-soluble HSs by 2.25 and 2.94 times, respectively, compared with the conventional alkaline extraction method. The process could result in a balanced distribution between nitrogen binding forms. The functionalized lignite showed a 14.5% reduction in the carbon content due to ozone oxidation and an 8.15% nitrogen enrichment due to urea pretreatment, leading to an ideal C/N ratio (5.6%) and a higher O/C ratio (0.94). The humification index (E4/E6 ratio of 6.8) and salt index (46.21%) were acceptable. The process could increase the cation exchange capacity of the lignite by 3.83 times while enhancing its carboxylic and phenolic groups by 215.87% and 85.71%, respectively. The crystallinity index of the processed lignite was increased by 2 times, and the availability of its macromicronutrients and rare earth elements was increased by 6.35 times and 43.38%, respectively. The nitro-humic products showed lower heavy metals with higher micropores-mesopores in a globular-like and heterogeneous porous structure.

Electrocatalytic techniques can convert urea from urea-rich wastewater to hydrogen for ecological protection and clean energy generation. But, the urea oxidation reaction suffers sluggish kinetics, which requires effective catalysts to promote the oxidation process. Recently, Ni-based materials have been widely researched as catalysts in the field of urea electrooxidation, owing to their low cost, low overpotential, high current density and good catalytic stability. However, urea-based fuel cells cannot be compared with other types of cryogenic fuel cells, owing to the high action temperature, sluggish anode reaction for urea electrooxidation and limited current density. In this Review, the morphological structure and elemental content ratio of nickel-based catalysts for urea electrooxidation and their application in urea-based fuel cells are summarized. Based on a literature review, the 3D structure of complex nickel-based composites with high conductivity and abundant active sites will be part of developing trends in the future nickel-based catalysts.

The electro-chemical measurements indicated that utilization of tin as a co-catalyst could strongly enhance the electrocatalytic activity if its content and calcination temperature were optimized. Typically, the nanofibers prepared from calcination of an electrospun solution containing 15 wt% SnCl2 at 700 degrees C have a current density almost 9-fold higher than that of pristine nickel-incorporated carbon nanofibers (77 and 9 mA/cm(2), respectively) at 30 degrees C in a 1.0 M urea solution. Furthermore, the current density increases to 175 mA/cm(2) at 55 degrees C for the urea oxidation reaction. Interestingly, the nanofibers prepared from a solution with 10 wt% of co-catalyst precursor show an onset potential of 175 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) at 55 degrees C, making this proposed composite an adequate anode material for direct urea fuel cells. Optimization of the co-catalyst content to maximize the generated current density resulted in a Gaussian function peak at 15 wt%. However, studying the influence of the calcination temperature indicated that 850 degrees C was the optimum temperature because synthesizing the proposed nanofibers at 1000 degrees C led to a decrease in the graphite content, which dramatically decreased the catalyst activity. Overall, the study opens a new venue for the researchers to exploit tin as effective co-catalyst to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the nickel-based nanostructures. Moreover, the proposed co-catalyst can be utilized with other functional electrocatalysts to improve their activity toward oxidation of different fuels. (C) 2018 The Authors.

As a result, currently, the exploitation of stable and nonprecious metal catalysts with elevated performance has become a research focus in overall water splitting. Here, we introduce a multicomponent material (Ni/MoC/ Ti3C2Tx@C) by a strategy of the combination of electrostatic assembly and elevated-temperature calcination to employ it as an electrocatalyst for water splitting and urea oxidation. The Ni/MoC/Ti3C2Tx@C electro-catalyst presents a superior hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction ability with an overpotential of 128 and 338 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, along with long-term stability over 24 h. The Ni/MoC/Ti3C2Tx@C catalyst has a turnover frequency of 1.64 s-1 at 100 mV. Improved catalytic behavior of Ni/MoC/Ti3C2Tx@C is principally due to the synergistic effect of Ni and MoC nanoparticles, the introduction of the conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene matrix with a layered porous structure, and the protection of the carbon layer. In addition, when Ni/MoC/Ti3C2Tx@C electrodes are used to electrolyze water with urea assistance, a voltage of 1.56 V is required for both electrodes to reach 10 mA cm-2, which is 80 mV lower than that required for conventional water electrolysis. Our work provides a strategy for the exploitation of elevated-performance MXene-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting as well as future advancement of green energy.					mengxiao, zhang/GYU-3986-2022	Yang, Liying/0000-0001-8611-7469													2574-0962					FEB 13	2023	6	3					1404	1412		10.1021/acsaem.2c03283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.2c03283													WOS:000932295300001

The catalytic activity toward the electro-oxidation of urea and benzyl alcohol was found to increase in the sequence Li+ < Na+ < K+. This activity's difference is partly caused by different surface blockage abilities by OH-M+(H2O)(x) (M: Li, Na, K) dusters, which is similar to many electrocatalytic reactions on Pt reported previously, additionally, incorporation of various cations to the catalyst may induce the activities difference as well.

Therefore, in this experiment, CuCo2O4@ACoNi-LDH (A = Fe, Cu, Zn, Cr) with heterogeneous core-shell catalytic material was firstly prepared by means of hydrothermal and calcination process, and its anodic oxidation reaction in freshwater, seawater and urea was investigated. In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of electrolytic water, CuCo2O4@CuCoNi-LDH displays the best catalytic activity. When the current density is 10 mA cm- 2, only the overpotential of 199 mV is needed (potential of 1.429 V). The competitive oxidation and corrosion of chloride ions in seawater result in the decrease of catalytic activity. For urea oxidation reaction (UOR), CuCo2O4@FeCoNi-LDH displays the best catalytic performance, only potential of 1.292 V was required with the same current density, and the catalyst had good stability during the reaction for 12 h. Density functional theory calculation shows that CuCo2O4 plays an important role in the catalytic process. The synergistic catalysis of FeCoNi-LDH and CuCo2O4 results in the improvement of catalyst activity and sta-bility. The CuCo2O4 material plays a key role in catalyzing urea splitting and the FeCoNi-LDH material protects CuCo2O4 from corrosion according to experimental results and density functional theory calculations. This experiment provides a new idea for the hydrogen production, exploration and the treatment of urea wastewater for transition metal oxides and layered hydroxides electrocatalyst with core-shell heterostructure.

High-valence nickelbased spinel, especially after heteroatom doping, excels in urea oxidation reactions (UOR). However, traditional spinel synthesis methods with prolonged high-temperature reactions lack kinetic precision, hindering the balance between controlled doping and highly active two-dimensional (2D) porous structures design. This significantly impedes the identification of electron configuration-dependent active sites in doped 2D nickel-based spinels. Herein, we present a microwave shock method for the preparation of 2D porous NiCo2O4 spinel. Utilizing the transient on-off property of microwave pulses for precise heteroatom doping and 2D porous structural design, non-metal doping (boron, phosphorus, and sulfur) with distinct extranuclear electron disparities serves as straightforward examples for investigation. Precise tuning of lattice parameter reveals the impact of covalent bond strength on NiCo2O4 structural stability. The introduced defect levels induce unpaired d-electrons in transition metals, enhancing the adsorption of electron-donating amino groups in urea molecules. Simultaneously, Bode plots confirm the impact mechanism of rapid electron migration caused by reduced band gaps on UOR activity. The prepared phosphorus-doped 2D porous NiCo2O4, with optimal electron configuration control, outperforms most reported spinels. This controlled modification strategy advances understanding theoretical structure-activity mechanisms of high-performance 2D spinels in UOR.

However, the sluggish kinetics caused by 6e- transfer greatly hinders the usage of urea as fuel, efficient catalysts are urgently needed in consequence. In response, alkali-assisted Mo doped into Ni-Mn layered double hydroxides (Mo-NiMnLDH-OH) with laminate structure is synthesized via one-pot hydrothermal method. The alkali-assisted Mo doping contributes the modified morphology and microstructure, the tuned chemical states of Ni and Mn species, simultaneously generates defects and more active sites. The existence of alkali plays a vital role in promoting the Mo doping. Without alkali, the Mo doping should damage the laminate structure, and the chemical states of active sites cannot be efficiently tuned. When used as catalyst for UOR, the current density of 45.3 mA cm-2 and a specific current activity of 1132.8 mA cm-2 mg- 1 for MoNiMnLDH-OH can be achieved at the potential of 1.623 V (vs. RHE), which is 4-fold higher than that for NiMn layered double hydroxides without doping. Both indirect electrochemical and direct urea oxidation processes occur when using Mo-NiMnLDH-OH as catalyst, and the existence of Mo species will facilitate the occurrence of direct urea oxidation process. This work paves an effective way to synergistically engineer of Mo doping and defects into Ni-based layered double hydroxides for UOR.					liu, zirui/HNK-6782-2023; Lv, Yanping/GLS-2340-2022														0016-2361	1873-7153				JAN 15	2024	356								129626	10.1016/j.fuel.2023.129626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2023.129626		AUG 2023											WOS:001072038800001

Herein, we report that self-supported amorphous NiFe hydroxides on nickel foam (NiFe/NF) are synthesized through a one-step corrosion method that is simple, rapid and scalable. Benefitting from the amorphous feature, 3D porous structure, and high electronic conductivity, the resultant NiFe/NF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst shows superior catalytic performance in alkaline electrolyte along with outstanding long-term stability, which ranks among the best oxygen evo-lution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) catalysts reported so far. Impressively, to deliver a current density of 50 mA cm-2 for the OER and UOR, only smaller potentials of 1.54 and 1.40 V are required, respectively.

Facile two-step synthesis of nickel nanoparticles supported on 3D porous carbon frameworks as an effective electrocatalyst for urea and methanol oxidation	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The design and development of facile and environmentally-friendly methods to prepare low-cost, high-activity electrocatalysts are desirable for the development of fuel cells. In our study, a high-efficiency anodic electrocatalyst for the oxidation of urea and methanol based on nickel nanoparticles supported on three-dimensional porous carbon frameworks (Ni/3DPCFs) was designed by an innovative and simple method. This innovative method is based on the preparation of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and nickel ions (Ni2+) adsorbed on its surface by microwave-assisted synthesis, followed by pyrolysis. The method is notable for simultaneously preparing Ni2+ and CQDs and not requiring a stabilizer, surfactant, or organic solvent. The results of scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) revealed that the CQDs were converted to 3DPCFs by pyrolysis and nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) were formed on the surface. The prepared electrocatalyst showed high efficiency for the oxidation of urea and methanol in alkaline media. The electrocatalytic activity of Ni/3DPCFs showed the maximum anodic current density of 102.5 and 153.8 mA/cm2 for urea and methanol oxidation, respectively.

J	Clark, R; Moore, A; MacInnis, M; Bertin, E				Clark, Rylan; Moore, Abigail; MacInnis, Marissa; Bertin, Erwan			Investigation of urea oxidation as a potential anode reaction during CO2 electrolysis	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY												The electrooxidation of urea was investigated on Ni90Fe10 electrodeposited films as an alternative reaction to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during CO2 electrolysis. The results show an excellent activity, 135 mA cm(geo)(-2) (by cyclic voltammetry) and stability (90-76.5 mA cm(geo)(-2)) over 30 min in alkaline media (NaOH 1 M + 0.25 M urea). The activity was extremely pH dependent, decreasing sharply at pH 12-13, but remaining higher than the OER at all pH investigated. The activity could be recovered by replacing the electrolyte by a fresh solution. The absence of correlation between the amount of NiOOH sites formed and the current measured at different pH suggests a limitation, either kinetic in the formation of NiOOH or in the amount of hydroxyl anions available, at pH < 14. Nevertheless, at pH approximate to 14, chronopotentiometry measurements revealed a gain of 120 mV in the potential needed to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(geo)(-2). Meanwhile, the production of formate at a tin cathode remained constant or slightly increased in the presence of urea at the anode at all potentials tested.

However, the low efficiency of semiconductor/cocatalysts type photoanodes for UOR restricts their applications in photoelectrocatalytic system. Herein, a new semiconductor/cocatalyst, Ni2P clusters sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays photoanode (Ni2P/TiO2-NTAs) for PEC-UOR with high efficiency are developed. The 1D TiO2-NTAs structure accelerates urea molecules diffusion and promotes CO2 gas release at the electrode interface. Meanwhile, Ni2P is also beneficial to urea molecule absorption and CO2 desorption and enable to lower the energy barrier for amine (N-H) dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the robust interfacial charge transfer pathway between Ni2P and TiO2 interface promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and the transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ni2P to TiO2. Therefore, this photoanode shows excellent PEC-UOR performance with the potential of 1.43 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) when the current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that of 2.24 V versus RHE and 1.58 V versus RHE for TiO2-NTAs and Ni(OH)(2)/TiO2-NTAs, respectively.

The main factor to improve the electrochemical oxidation per-formance of urea and further enhance the performances of DUFC is the use of a good anode catalyst. Non-noble metal catalyst, such as nickel, is reported to have a good catalytic activity in alkaline medium towards urea electro-oxidation. Besides optimizing the anode catalyst, the use of supporting electrode which has a large surface area as well as the use of H2O2 as an oxidant to replace O-2 could help to improve the performances. The recent progress in anode catalysts for DUFC is overviewed in this article.

Herein a 3D self-supported hierarchical-architectured nanoarray electrode (CC/MnNi@NC) is proposed in which 1D N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) with 0D MnNi nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulation are intertwined into 2D nanosheet aligned on the carbon cloth for prominently boosted and sustained UOR electrocatalysis. From combined experimental and theoretical investigations, Mn-alloying can regulate Ni electronic state with downshift of the d-band center, facilitating active Ni3+ species generation and prompting the rate-determining step (*COO intermediate desorption). Meanwhile, the micro/nano-hierarchical nanoarray configuration with N-CNTs encapsulating MnNi NPs can not only endow strong operational durability against metal corrosion/agglomeration and enrich the density of active sites, but also accelerate electron transfer, and more intriguingly, promote mass transfer as a result of desirable superhydrophilic and quasi-superaerophobic characteristics. Therefore, with such elegant integration of 0D, 1D and 2D motifs into 3D micro/nano-hierarchical architecture, the resulting CC/MnNi@NC can deliver admirable UOR performance, favorably comparable to the best-performing UOR electrocatalysts reported thus far.

The efficient UOR catalysis substantially depends on the exposed active sites and mass transfer resistance, especially at high current density to meet the requirement of industrial water splitting technology. In this work, we have synthesized aNi(OH)2 porous nanoflowers (a-Ni(OH)2-PNF) using ZIF-67 as template. Ascribing to the Kirkendall effect, nanopores are created on a-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets benefiting for the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies as well as drop-off in mass transfer resistance during UOR catalysis. Meanwhile, the binding strength between active site and CO2, ratedetermining step of UOR, is weakened by oxygen vacancies; as a result, only 1.477 V vs. RHE is demanded for a-Ni(OH)2-PNF to catalyze UOR with 100 mA cm-2, 67 mV lower than a-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets.

Urea Electro-Oxidation Catalyzed by an Efficient and Highly Stable Ni-Bi Bimetallic Nanoparticles	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS												Direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) are proficient technology for sustainable energy applications as well as for urea waste present in water. Basically, urea oxidation suffers from sluggish electrokinetics and the proposed complex formation eventually needs six electron transfers due to their large scale utilization. The electrochemical oxidation of urea on Ni nanoparticles (Ni NPs) is perceived as energetic, but it has lower stability due to catalyst deactivation and limited active sites and is found to be responsible for inferior activity towards oxidative conversion of urea. Herein, we have demonstrated the synthesis of Ni-Bi bimetallic nanoparticles by using the chemical reduction method, structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), having mixed phases of FCC and a rhombohedral structure, corresponding to Ni and Bi, respectively. BET surface area measurement concluded that the surface area of Ni-Bi bimetallic nanoparticles is higher than that of individual Ni and Bi NPs. TGA exhibited that the Ni-Bi bimetallic composite is thermally more stable compared to individual Bi and Ni NPs. Morphological studies from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirm heterostructured interface formation of Ni (5 nm) with Bi (3 nm) nanoparticles. Furthermore, electrochemical activity of Ni-Bi bimetallic NPs was investigated by cyclic voltammetric studies, showing a high current density of catalyst of 37.5 mA/cm(2) with an ultralow potential of E = 0.29 V vs SCE compared to individual Ni and Bi NPs, which may be due to their synergetic structural and electronic effects at the nanoscale. The EIS reveals that the Ni-Bi bimetallic NPs have faster electron transfer, which could be due to having merits like stabilization of the intermediate, synergetic effect, and comparatively more adsorption of urea molecules. This work provides the noble metal-free electrocatalyst for the mechanistic path for urea oxidation and assists in significant implication toward H-2 production from natural and manmade wastes like animal/human urine, urea-rich industrial effluent water, and other industrial and medical wastes.

However, it remains great challenge for CP-based catalysts to be utilized for electrocatalytic oxidation reactions due to their inefficient activities and low catalytic stabilities. Herein, we applied a mixed-metal strategy to fabricate two-dimensional CoxNi1-x-CPs with dual active sites for electrocatalytic water and urea oxidation. By metal ratio regulation in the twodimensional layer, an optimized Co2/3Ni1/3-CP exhibits a water oxidation performance with an overpotential of 325 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 86 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution for oxygen evolution reaction. Importantly, a lower potential than that of commercial RuO2 is observed over 20 mA cm(-2). Co2/3Ni1/3-CP also displays a potential of 1.381 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for urea oxidation reaction and a Tafel slope of 124 mV dec(-1). This mixed-metal strategy to maximize synergistic effect of different metal centers may ultimately lead to promising electrocatalysts for small molecule oxidation reaction.

The energy required in the process of electrochemical hydrogen production can be reduced by choosing urea oxidation reaction (UOR) instead of OER. In this work, nickel hydroxysulfide is synthesized on nickel foam (NiSOH/NF) and its electrocatalytic performance was tested in UOR. Experimental results show that the vulcanization catalyst requires a low potential of 1.38 V (vs RHE) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm-2 in an electrolyte containing 0.5 M urea, which is 270 mV lower than the conventional OER process. This innovative approach has yielded a substantial reduction in the cell voltage necessary for overall water splitting under two electrode system, thereby enhancing its efficiency and feasibility.

The rate of decomposition of urea was highest under acidic conditions (pH 4) compared with those at pH 7 and 10. When used in combination with dispersed TiO2, a photocatalyst, high decomposition efficiency was achieved with less power consumption. Moreover, decomposition efficiency more than two times higher than that of ozone oxidation and sodium hypochlorite oxidation could be realized.																			1345-8957	1347-3352				JUL	2018	67	7					917	924		10.5650/jos.ess18031	http://dx.doi.org/10.5650/jos.ess18031								29899193					WOS:000437769300014

The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternatives to OER, owing to its low thermodynamic potential. However, owing to the sluggish UOR kinetics, its potential in practical use has not been unlocked. Herein, we developed a tungsten-doped nickel catalyst (Ni-WOx) with superior activity towards UOR. The Ni-WOx catalyst exhibited record fast reaction kinetics (440 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and a high turnover frequency of 0.11 s(-1), which is 4.8 times higher than that without W dopants. In further experiments, we found that the W dopant regulated the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of Ni3+ sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the interfacial catalytic reaction. Moreover, when we integrated Ni-WOx into a CO2 flow electrolyzer, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.16 V accompanying with approximate to 98 % Faradaic efficiency towards carbon monoxide.

However, the scarcity and high cost of noble metals severely limited their application as electrocatalysts for UOR. Herein, we have prepared the composite (Ni@S-C) of nickel nanocrystal embedded in sulfur-doped carbon through facile impregnation method followed by calcination method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study indicates the Ni(III) species in Ni@S-C are more positive than typical Ni(III), which serve as the active sites for UOR. Meanwhile, the active Ni(III) is coordinated with S, which facilitates charge transfer and chemisorption of active oxygen species. Under optimal experimental conditions, the Ni@S-C-500 catalyst indicates an excellent UOR activity of 177 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH + 0.33 M urea at 1.656 V, which was 3.75 times as much as that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Meanwhile, the optimal Ni@S-C-500 catalyst also presents a current density (j) retention rate of 80% after 12 h UOR test, which is much higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (< 15% retention).

Herein, amorphization Nicysteine coordination (aNi-cys) is constructed as efficient urea electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) catalyst with highly capable of suppressing competitive OER and promoting the Ni2+ to Ni3+ in-situ electrochemical configuration through deliberately regulating the Ni/L-cysteine coordination environment. The abundant ligand atoms (N, S, and O) of L-cysteine considerably tuned the Ni electronic structure to the most suitable state while the amorphization thin lamellas increased the exposed active sites and befitting for the access of electrolyte to electrode surface, resulting improved UOR activity with a large peak current density of 263 mA cm(-2), far exceeding crystalline Ni-cysteine coordination (cNi-cys) and long-term stability for 50 h working. Excitingly, only 41 kWh is required to produce 1 kg H-2 (50 mA cm(-2)) from a home-made urea-assisted simulated seawater electrolysis apparatus, about 8 kWh energy saving from that of water splitting.

This study demonstrates that incorporating Mo into Co3O4 facilitated the formation of rich oxygen vacancies (Vo), which promotes effective nitrate adsorption and activation in urea electrolysis. Subsequently, in situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to explore the active sites in Mo-Co3O4-3 under OER, indicating the oxygen vacancies are first filled with OH center dot in Mo-Co3O4; facilitated the pre-oxidation of low-valence Co, and promoted the reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediate Co-OOH center dot. Mo-Co3O4-3 electrocatalysts show impressive HER, OER, and UOR with low overpotentials of 141 mV, 220 mV, and 1.32 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, in situ/Operando Raman spectroscopy results reveal the importance of CoOOH active sites for enhanced electrochemical performance in Mo-Co3O4-3 compared to the pure Co3O4. The urea electrolyzer with Mo-Co3O4 electrocatalysts acts as an anode and the cathode delivers 1.42 V at 10 mA cm(-2). A viable approach to creating effective UOR electrocatalysts involves synergistic engineering exploiting doping and oxygen vacancies.

Additionally, the synthesis of materials that can exhibit more than one electrocatalytic reaction is notable. In this work, stepwise electrodeposited nickel-iron hydroxide nanoarrays are investigated as anode electrocatalysts with enhanced performance towards the oxidation of water, urea, and hydrazine.

However, the development of highly active catalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) remains challenging. To address this, a p-n heterostructure nickel sulfide/cobalt oxide catalyst grown on nickel foam, referred to Ni3S2/Co3O4-NF, composed of Ni3S2 nanosheets and Co3O4 nanoneedles supported on foam nickel, is proposed. The p-n heterojunction plays a crucial role in altering the electronic structure of catalysts, facilitating efficient charge transfer from n-type Ni3S2 to p-type Co3O4. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the built-in electric field at the Ni3S2/Co3O4 p-n heterojunction interface induces the formation of local electrophilic/nucleophilic regions, promoting the adsorption and decomposition process of urea molecules. The testing results demonstrate that the Ni3S2/Co3O4-NF p-n heterojunction catalyst exhibits excellent urea catalytic activity, requiring only a potential of 1.288 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, and displays remarkable durability over a 100-h operation period.

Here, a doping engineering strategy is adopted to obtain a ternary NiMoV layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet array supported on the three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam substrate. The synergistic effect brought by the unique 2D/3D hierarchical structure could expose more active sites and accelerate charge and mass transfer. In addition, experimental and theoretical results confirm that Mo and V dopants are capable of modifying the local electronic structure of Ni sites to optimize the adsorption energy for urea molecules. Therefore, the as-prepared NiMoV LDH/NF electrode realizes highefficiency catalysis for UOR in view of the rapid kinetics, high intrinsic activity and robust durability. Specifically, NiMoV LDH/NF electrode presents a low potential of 1.40 V to deliver 100 mA cm-2 for UOR, which is about 260 mV less for its urea-free counterpart in alkaline electrolyte. When anodic NiMoV LDH/NF electrode and cathodic Pt/C electrode are integrated into a two-electrode system for water electrolysis in variable urea concentration and pH values conditions, urea-assisted electrolysis water system exhibit the lower potential (<= 1.63 V) than that of conventional water electrolysis at 100 mA cm-2. This work shows that the local electronic structure adjustment of the active site caused by the heteroatom doping effect could improve the electrocatalytic oxidation performance of some small molecules.

The functional groups presented in these compounds serve as important building blocks in numerous natural, pharmeceutical and agricultural compounds. These deriatives have been prepared through a multitude of routes which were accompanied by several drawbacks. Therefore, there has been an ever-increasing interest to find a new methodology that leads to the production of these compounds via an environmentally benign path bringing about high yields. Recently, gem-dihydroperoxides have attracted much attention due to their oxidizing power and they have been utilized in several oxidation processes. Methods: We carried out a chemoselective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones on treatment with urea-2,2-dihydroperoxypropane, a solid oxidant composed of equal amounts of 2,2-dihydroperoxypropane and urea, using THE as the solvent under catalyst-free conditions at room tempram re. Results: Sulfides possessing a variety of substitutions namely dialkyl, diaryl, ally 1 and alkyl-aryl were subjected to the optimized reaction conditions and they could successfully afford different amounts of sulfoxides and sulfones depending on the amount of the oxidant utilized. Based on the results, electron donating groups accelerated the reaction while electron-withdrawing substituents lowered the reactivity. Conclusion: Urea-2,2-dihydroperoxypropane as a solid oxidant which can be stored for several months without any loss in its activity has proved its capability to oxidize sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones under catalyst-free and mild conditions. This approach is a cost-effective and environmentally benign methodology via which the products have been synthesized in high yields and short reaction times.

Due to the extensive use of urea in many branches of industry, it is produced in large quantities. Urea enters into the environment not only with wastewater from the production plants but also by leaching from the fields, agro-breeding farms, and the effluents from the plants using it as a raw material. There are many methods of urea removal, but most of them are still being developed or are very new. The methods themselves differ in terms of physicochemical nature and technological ingenuity.

In this work, Fe-doped Ni-based bimetallic oxide hierarchical nanostructures are synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal-calcination method. The electronic conductivity of NiFe-oxides can be effectively improved by adjusting the doping amount of Fe2+. Moreover, the density of states verifies the theoretical feasibility of enhancing electronic conductivity.

This study found that the oxidative degradation of urea by chlorination was enhanced by the pH swing, wherein the reaction proceeded under an acidic pH (e.g., pH = 3) in the first stage, and the solution pH was subsequently increased to a neutral or alkaline value (e.g., pH > 7) in the second-stage reaction. The degradation rate of urea by pH-swing chlorination increased with increasing chlorine dose and pH during the second-stage reaction. The pH-swing chlorination was based on the opposite pH dependence of sub-processes comprising urea chlorination. The formation of monochlorourea was favored under acidic pH conditions; however, the subsequent conversion into di- and trichloroureas was favored under neutral or alkaline pH conditions. The deprotonation of monochlorourea (pKa = 9.7 & PLUSMN; 1.1) and dichlorourea (pKa = 5.1 & PLUSMN; 1.4) was suggested to be responsible for the accelerated reaction in the second stage under increased pH conditions. pH-swing chlorination was also effective in degrading urea at low concentrations (micromolar levels). In addition, the total nitrogen concentration significantly decreased during the degradation of urea because of the volatilization of chloramines and the release of other gaseous nitrogen compounds.

It has the unique ability to purify sewage while simultaneously generating electricity, making it a highly efficient and environmentally friendly option. In this paper, pomegranate seed-like Ni nano-blocks and Fe nanosheets were synthesized by electrodeposition and chemical reduction and attached to the carbonized melamine sponge matrix. The N-doped carbon sponge (NCS) provided a large number of polyhedral holes, which allowed for efficient gas escape through channels. The combination of Fe reduces the initial urea oxidation potential, reaction activation energy and reaction resistance. The synthesized FeNi supported on N-doped carbon sponge composite (FeNi@NCS) has a catalytic current density of 625 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 42.51 mV dec-1 for urea electrooxidation reaction (UOR). Assembling the direct urine-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (DUrHPFC) resulted in the highest performance output. The open circuit voltage (OCV) was 0.98 V, and the peak power density reached 9.61 mW cm-2.

However, not only does urea oxidation reaction technology facilitate energy conversion, but it also significantly contributes to treating wastewater rich in urea. Furthermore, urea electrolysis has a significantly lower theoretical potential (0.37 V) compared to water electrolysis (1.23 V). As an electrochemical reaction, the catalytic efficacy of urea oxidation is largely contingent upon the catalyst employed. Among the plethora of urea oxidation electrocatalysts, nickel-based compounds emerge as the preeminent transition metal due to their cost-effectiveness and heightened activity in urea oxidation. Ni(OH)2 is endowed with manifold advantages, including structural versatility, facile synthesis, and stability in alkaline environments. This review delineates the recent advancements in Ni(OH)2 catalysts for electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction, encapsulating pivotal research findings in morphology, dopant incorporation, defect engineering, and heterogeneous architectures. Additionally, we have proposed personal insights into the challenges encountered in the research on nickel hydroxide for urea oxidation, aiming to promote efficient urea conversion and facilitate its practical applications.

In this work, Ni-0-rich Ni/NiO nanocrystals were facilely synthesized on the surface of acid-treated nickel foam via thermal annealing in Ar/H-2 (denoted as NF@Acid-H-2). The three-dimensional free-standing NF@Acid-H-2 electrode exhibited high HER and UOR activities at 156 mV and at 1.33 V to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), respectively. The urea electrolyzer needed a cell voltage of 1.49 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and could continuously generate H-2 for 20 h with negligible activity loss. Systematic study revealed that the presence of Ni-0 played a significant role to improve both HER and UOR performance. In particular, the Ni-0-rich Ni/NiO exhibited better catalytic performance than that of Ni-0-less counterpart. This work proved that the high urea electrolysis performance was dependent on the rational design of non-precious metal electrocatalysts with controllable compositions and hierarchical nanostructures.

The Ni(OH)(2) obtained at the KOH concentration of 0.25 M displayed superior performance among the samples in terms of activities and stability. Further investigation proves that the enhanced urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activities can be ascribed to the cooperation of the larger electrochemical surface area, a faster electronic transfer speed, and a lower transfer resistance on the surface. These findings provide a new route for the rational design and synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with relatively lower energy consumption that aims to be large-scale synthesized and utilized in clean energy conversion and applications.					; Zhang, Yongxing/F-2020-2016	Liang, Ma/0000-0002-8122-8976; Zhang, Yongxing/0000-0003-4238-3268													2365-6549					FEB 16	2023	8	7							e202204949	10.1002/slct.202204949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.202204949													WOS:000936696300001

Herein we put forward a novel N-doping induced phase transfer strategy to construct anomalous metastable hcp Ni with metal Co and non-metal N dual doping engineering (hcp-CoNi-N/C) for manipulating electronic state and catalytic response toward the UOR. Impressively, the hcp-CoNi-N/C can deliver prominent UOR performance with an exceptionally low potential of 1.310 V vs. RHE to attain 10 mA cm-2 and fast reaction kinetics (34.0 mV dec-1), standing out among the best UOR catalysts reported to date. The combined experimental analysis and theoretical calculations disclose that unconventional hcp phase design coupled with metal and non-metal dual doping engineering enables electron density manipulation and creates a charge-polarized surface favorable for urea adsorption and C-N bond cleavage, thereby substantially promoting urea decomposition. Meanwhile, such synergistic phase and doping engineering can boost mass transfer kinetics via tailoring the wetting characteristics. This study offers a new paradigm to craft advanced metallic Ni-based UOR catalysts through unusual metastable phase design synergistic with multiple doping engineering.

Herein, we use the pyridinic-N doping carbon layers coupled with tensile strain of FeNi alloy activated by NiFe2O4 (FeNi/NiFe2O4@NC) for efficiently increasing the performance of water and urea oxidation. Due to the tensile strain effect on FeNi/NiFe2O4@NC, it provides a favorable modulation on the electronic properties of the active center, thus enabling amazing OER (h100 = 196 mV) and UOR (E10 = 1.32 V) intrinsic activity. Besides, the carbon-coated layers can be used as armor to prevent FeNi alloy from being corroded by the electrolyte for enhancing the OER/UOR stability at large current density, showing high industrial practicability. This work thus provides a simple way to prepare high-efficiency catalyst for activating water and urea oxidation. (c) 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Nickel-doped TiO2 and thiophene-naphthalenediimide copolymer based inorganic/ organic nano-heterostructure for the enhanced photoelectrochemical urea oxidation reaction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												To overcome the global challenges of energy crises and environmental threats, urea oxidation is a hopeful route to utilize urea-rich wastewater as an energy source for hydrogen production. Herein, we report an inorganic/organic type of nano-heterostructure (NHseNi-TiO2/p-NDIHBT) as a photoanode with excellent urea oxidation efficiency driven by visible light. This heterostructured photoanode consists of nickel (Ni)-doped TiO2 nanorods (NRs) arrays as an inorganic part and a D-A-D type organic polymer i.e p-NDIHBT as an organic part. The as-prepared photoanode was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphological studies of TEM confirm the coating of p-NDIHBT on NieTiO(2) NPs (similar to 1 mm). The consequence of heterostructure formation on optical and photo-electrochemical (PEC) properties of photoanode were explored through photo-electrochemical responses under visible light irradiation. The photoelectrochemical activity of NieTiO(2) and NieTiO(2)/p-NDIHBT photoanode from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) shows the ultrahigh photocurrent density of 0.36 mA/cm(2) and 2.21 mA/cm(2), respectively measured at 1.965 V-RHE. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of both photoanodes shows a highly sensitive nature toward the urea oxidation reaction. The hybrid photoanode also exhibits high photostability, good solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, and high faradaic efficiency for urea oxidation. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Advanced oxidation technology shows excellent development prospect for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal due to strong oxidation ability and green process. This article proposed a novel separation process for H2S from gas stream using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)/H2O2/urea wet scrubbing system in a VUV-spraying scrubber, and studied the effectiveness of H2S removal and removal pathways using VUV/H2O2/urea wet scrubbing system. Results indicated that the highest H2S removal efficiency was up to 98.2 % under optimal experimental conditions. Increasing UV-light intensity and solution pH improved the H2S removal efficiency. Increasing fluegas flow rate and H2S concentration decreased the H2S removal efficiency. The increase of H2O2 concentration, reaction temperature, liquid-gas ratio or urea concentration first increased and then reducedthe H2S removal efficiency. H2S was removed by five pathways such as ionization, urea absorption, H2O2 oxidation, photolysis and center dot OH oxidation. Photolysis and center dot OH oxidation were the two major pathways forthe H2S removal. (c) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this work, an Ni2P-nanoparticle-integrated porous nickel oxide (NiO) hetero-structured nanosheet (Ni2P@NiO/NiF) catalyst was synthesized through in situ acid etching and a gas-phase phosphating process. The as-synthesized Ni2P@NiO/NiF catalyst sample was then used to enhance the electro-oxidation reaction of urea with a higher urea oxidation response (50 mA cm(-2) at 1.31 V vs. RHE) and low onset oxidation potential (1.31 V). The enhanced activity of the Ni2P@NiO/NiF catalyst was mainly attributed to effective electron transport after Ni2P nanoparticle insertion through a substantial improvement in active sites due to a larger electrochemical surface area, and a faster diffusion of ions occurred via the interactive sites at the interface of Ni2P and NiO; thus, the structural reliability was retained, which was further evidenced by the low charge transfer resistance. Further, the Ni2P nanoparticle insertion process into the NiO hetero-structured nanosheets effectively enabled a synergetic effect when compared to the counter of the Ni2P/NiF and NiO/NiF catalysts. Finally, we demonstrate that the as-synthesized Ni2P@NiO/NiF catalyst could be a promising electrode for the EOU in urea-rich wastewater and human urine samples for environmental safety management. Overall, the Ni2P@NiO/NiF catalyst electrode combines the advantages of the Ni2P catalyst, NiO nanosheet network, and NiF current collector for enhanced EOU performance, which is highly valuable in catalyst development for environmental safety applications.					wang, hui/HSG-6135-2023; Kannan, Palanisamy/E-7198-2011; Subramanian, Palaniappan/B-1179-2012	Subramanian, Palaniappan/0000-0003-1000-6994														2079-4991				OCT	2022	12	20							3633	10.3390/nano12203633	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano12203633								36296823					WOS:000875179500001

The optimal Ni2Mo1/G catalysts exhibit fine mesoporous geometric structure (pore size: 3.75 nm, particle size: 20 similar to 40 nm) and superior electronic structure with richer MoOx species and Ni3+ electroactive sites. Owing to the structural/electronic effects, the Ni2Mo1/G catalysts achieve higher activity and stability (128 mA cm(-2) at 0.53 V; 76% retention for 1000 s at 0.50 V) but comparable kinetics (onset potential: 0.39 V; Tafel slope: 120 mV dec(-1)) comparing with the Ni/G nanocatalysts (107 mA cm(-2) at 0.51 V; 55% retention for 1000 s at 0.50 V; 0.36 V; 105 mV dec(-1)). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) results reveal the typical catalyst regeneration mechanism (EC') and diffusion-kinetics mixed processes for the Ni2Mo1/G catalysts towards alkaline urea electrooxiation, showing the charge transfer coefficient (a) and diffusion coefficient (D) respective values of 0.73 and 1.11 x 10(-5)cm(2) s(-1). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel results display the average Tafel slopes (113 mV dec(-1); 110 mV dec(-1)) and the chemical reaction orders (1.03; 0.60/-0.38/0.32) towards KOH and urea concentrations respectively. Chronoamperometry (CA) results indicate a favorable electrocatalytic endurance by proper Mo doping. The structural/electronic effects tend to produce more Ni3+ electroactive species and promote the oxidation of urea intermediates via the bi-functional mechanism of the MoOx.

Structure engineering is an efficient approach to tailoring the electrical conductivity and the quantities of active sites. Herein, a series of hierarchical NiCr hydroxide nanowire-assembled nanospheres with tunable crystallinity have been synthesized by hydrothermal method. The effect of Cr content on the structure and the electrochemical properties of NiCr hydroxides has been investigated. The axially aligned nanowires ensure the exposure of active sites; the crystalline/amorphous domain boundaries are intrinsically more active; the amorphous structure improves the electrical conductivity; the incorporation of Cr3+ promotes the charge transfer kinetics. The 10Cr-Ni(OH)(2) with the optimized Cr3+ content and domain boundaries shows the best catalytic performance with a reduction of 35 mV in onset potential relative to the alpha-Ni(OH)(2). In addition, the 10Cr-Ni(OH)(2) demonstrates good long-term working stability. (C) 2021ElsevierLtd. Allrightsreserved.

This study initially prepared CoMnSe2 on nickel foam via a solvothermal method. By adjusting the doping ratio of Mn, the catalytic performance is further optimized, with the best performance achieved at a Mn doping level of 0.3 mmol (CoMn0.3Se2). To enhance its catalytic kinetics, a metal nickel layer is deposited on CoMn0.3Se2/NF through electrodeposition, and the influence of electrodeposition time (300, 500, 700 s) on its performance was investigated. The results demonstrated that at an electrodeposition time of 500 s, NiCoMn0.3Se2/NF-5 exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance. For the hydrogen evolution reaction, it reached -193 mV@100 mA cm-2, while for the urea oxidation reaction, it achieved 1.395 V@100 mA cm-2. A dual-electrode electrolysis cell is established using Ni-CoMn0.3Se2/NF-5 as both the cathode and anode. In comparison, the cell voltage (1.6 V at 100 mA cm-2) is lower than other materials. The research provides a creative solution for the synthesis of high-performance dual-function catalysts.

J	Wen, W; Du, XQ				Wen, Wei; Du, Xiaoqiang			Controlled synthesis of Sn doped Cu-Ni3S2 on Ni foam as efficient electrocatalyst for urea oxidation reaction and oxygen evolution reaction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Hydrogen production technology by urea-assisted electrocatalytic water decomposition has become one of the important means to alleviate carbon emissions and water pollution. In this paper, we first doped Sn and Cu element into the Ni3S2 material by hydrothermal method on the Ni foam support. This Cu-Sn-Ni3S2 material exhibits superior urea (potential of 1.42 V at 100 mA cm- 2) and water oxidation (potential of 1.63 V at 100 mA cm- 2) properties, which is one of the best electrochemical performance reported up to now. Analysis of experiment demonstrate that the increase in catalytic performance is assigned to faster charge transfer, more exposure of reaction centres and smaller resistance owing to doping of Sn and Cu. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis demonstrates that introduction of Sn and Cu increases the adsorption energy of urea and improves the conductivity of the Cu-Sn-Ni3S2 material, and the co-doping of the two changes the electron state density of the active site, thereby promoting the catalytic performance. This work provides insights into the development of efficient bifunctional electrodes for urea oxidation and oxygen evolution reaction through doping strategies.																			0360-3199	1879-3487				OCT 4	2024	85						48	58		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.08.280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.08.280		AUG 2024											WOS:001301745900001

We demonstrated that nickel-iron borate (NiFe-B) electrocatalysts supported on carbon paper (CP) for UERs through a one-pot solvothermal method. NiFe-B electrocatalysts were obtained with numerous Ni/Fe molar ratios in the precursors, and the physicochemical features of the NiFe-B were examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The optimized NiFe-B/CP exhibited a low onset potential (E-onset = 0.287 V vs. SCE) with a Tafel slope of 27.9 mV/dec on CP, demonstrating much greater performance UERs. Furthermore, the NiFe-B/CP catalysts have shown a superior activity for the UERs in alkaline solution and exhibit more than two-fold enhancement in activity than Ni-B.

However, the accurate relationship between their complex components (i.e., elements, phase structure, grain boundary density) and intrinsic catalytic activity is still unclear. Herein, a series of bulk MPEAs with face-centered cubic (FCC) phase structures were fabricated by the arc-melting method under an argon atmosphere. Compared to the CrCoNi and CrCoNiFeMn, the CrCoNiFe affords a higher UOR performance with the lowest overpotential of 331 mV at 10 mA center dot cm (-2) in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, due to excellent conductivity and high density of grain boundaries. The urea electrolyzer using CrCoNiFe as anode and Pt as cathode shows a low voltage of 1.622 V at 10 mA cm (-2) and longterm stability of 60 h at 20 mA cm 2 (4.08% decrease).

Influence of the composition and crystalline phase of electrodeposited CoNi films in the preparation of CoNi oxidized surfaces as electrodes for urea electro-oxidation	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												Oxidized species of CoNi have been obtained by means of electrodeposition of CoNi films and posterior electro-oxidation, to obtain electrodes able to be catalysts of oxidative reactions in alkaline medium. The products of electro-oxidation formed, which depend on the composition and the crystal phase of CoNi deposits, have been identified; for this, Co-fcc, Co-hcp, Co7Ni3-fcc, Co7Ni3-hcp, Co5Ni5-fcc and Ni-fcc films have been electrodeposited and oxidized. The influence of the crystalline phase of the films in the nature of the superficial oxides formed has been demonstrated: the electrodes prepared from CoNi-fcc films contained beta-co(x)Nio((1-x))oH(2), while those prepared from Co7Ni3-hcp films contained Co2NiO4 and beta-co(x)Ni((1-x))(oH)(2). The catalytic behaviour of the electro-oxidized electrodes for urea electro-oxidation was evaluated. Separate tests were performed to differentiate the influence of the composition and the crystalline structure of the initial films and, therefore, of the different oxidized species formed. The electrodes prepared by electro-oxidation of the Co7Ni3-hcp films show better electro-catalytic performance for urea's oxidation than those obtained by oxidation of the Co7Ni3-fcc, because they induce higher intensity, lower onset potential and lesser simultaneous oxygen evolution, becoming a good anode for urea electro-oxidation in urea electrolysis for hydrogen production or waste water treatment.

The development of a dual-functional electrocatalyst with outstanding efficiency and long-lasting stability holds significant importance. In this paper, firstly, MoO3/NF is synthesized through hydrothermal and calcination with NF as matrix. Subsequently, Co2P is formed on the MoO3/NF using electrodeposition in a two-electrode system, and the impact of electrodeposition time on the electrocatalytic property is investigated. The experiment shows that the optimized material (Co2P@MoO3/NF) exhibits promising potential as a dual-functional catalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction and urea oxidation reaction. The overpotentials at 100 mA center dot cm(-2) are 163 mV and 1.40 V, correspondingly. Moreover, a two-electrode electrolyzer of Co2P@MoO3/NF parallel to Co2P@MoO3/NF is built for overall urea splitting (OUS). The overpotential for OUS is 1.65 V at 100 mA center dot cm(-2), which exhibits a reduction of 170 mV compared to the overall water splitting (OWS, 1.82 V).

The efficiency of H2 electrocatalytic generation can be improved by reducing the anode potential or substituting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for oxygen evolution process. Here, we report a robust catalyst based on Co2P/NiMoO4 heterojunction arrays supported on nickel foam (NF) for water splitting and urea oxidation. In the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media, the optimized catalyst Co2P/NiMoO4/NF displayed a lower overpotential (169 mV) at a large current density (150 mA cm-2) compared to 20 wt% Pt/C/NF (295 mV@150 mA cm-2). In the OER and UOR, the potentials were as low as 1.45 and 1.34 V. These values surpass (for OER), or compare favorably to (for UOR), the most advanced commercial catalyst RuO2/NF (at 10 mA cm-2). This outstanding performance was attributed to the addition of Co2P, which has a significant effect on the chemical environment and electron structure of NiMoO4, while increasing the number of active sites and promoting charge transfer across the Co2P/NiMoO4 interface. This work proposes a high-performance and cost-effective electrocatalyst for water splitting and urea oxidation.

Urea removal strategies for dialysate regeneration in a wearable artificial kidney	BIOMATERIALS												The availability of a wearable artificial kidney (WAK) that provides dialysis outside the hospital would be an important advancement for dialysis patients. The concept of a WAK is based on regeneration of a small volume of dialysate in a closed-loop. Removal of urea, the primary waste product of nitrogen metabolism, is the major challenge for the realization of a WAK since it is a molecule with low reactivity that is difficult to adsorb while it is the waste solute with the highest daily molar production. Currently, no efficient urea removal technology is available that allows for miniaturization of the WAK to a size and weight that is acceptable for patients to carry. Several urea removal strategies have been explored, including enzymatic hydrolysis by urease, electro-oxidation and sorbent systems. However, thus far, these methods have toxic side effects, limited removal capacity or slow removal kinetics. This review discusses different urea removal strategies for application in a wearable dialysis device, from both a chemical and a medical perspective.

In this experiment, different metal ions M (M=Co, Cr, Cu, Zn) doped Ni3S2/FeS were investigated as catalysts with good catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as in urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea electrolyte, and Co-Ni3S2/FeS and Cr-Ni3S2/FeS, which performed well in HER and UOR, were assembled into an electrolytic cell for the overall urea decomposition (1.50 V @ 10 mA cm-2). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that Co-Ni3S2 possesses a lower free energy for H, while FeS possesses a higher density of states (DOS) near the Fermi energy level, and such a composite structure promotes significantly the catalytic activity of HER. The catalytic effect of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was further investigated in the seawater electrolyte, and the results showed that the performance of Co-Ni3S2/FeS catalyst was better, and certain ions in seawater affected durability of the catalyst. The electronic structure of the catalyst was investigated through the characterization of the catalyst and combined with the special morphology jointly promote the catalytic reaction in electrolysis experiments, which provides a candidate catalyst for electrolysis of urea and seawater oxidation reaction.																			2468-0230					JUN	2024	49								104432	10.1016/j.surfin.2024.104432	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfin.2024.104432		MAY 2024											WOS:001240577400001

However, urine is mainly composed of water and urea, while they have been demonstrated as an excellent hydrogen carrier for sustainable energy supply. Through the simple chemical coprecipitation and hydrothermal reaction, the needle-like NiMoO4 crystals were synthesized with the average width around 500 nm and length up to 4 mu m. The resulted products were thoroughly characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectrum. The needle-like NiMoO4 crystals exhibited excellent electrocatalytic oxidation toward urea at anode in alkali solution, leading to the increased performance of hydrogen evolution reaction at cathode with the lower electrochemical potential and energy consumption required to drive the reaction. The high electrocatalysis of the needle-like NiMoO4 crystals toward urea oxidation reveals their great potential for future application to clean the urine/urea-rich wastewater and to produce hydrogen in space station and environmental wastewater.																			0218-625X	1793-6667				FEB	2018	25	2							1850061	10.1142/S0218625X18500610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218625X18500610													WOS:000424010400015

Substituting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower theoretical voltage for water oxidation reaction adopting nickel-based electrocatalysts engenders reduced energy consumption for hydrogen production. The main obstacle remains strong interaction between accumulated Ni3+ and *COO in the conventional Ni3+-catalyzing pathway. Herein, a novel Ni3+/Ni2+ mediated pathway for UOR via constructing a heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), which efficiently lowers the energy barrier of UOR and avoids the accumulation of Ni3+ and excessive adsorption of *COO on the electrocatalysts, is developed. As a result, Ni2P4O12/NiTe demonstrates an exceptionally low potential of 1.313 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) toward efficient urea oxidation reaction while simultaneously showcases an overpotential of merely 24 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction. Constructing urea electrolysis electrolyzer using Ni2P4O12/NiTe at both sides attains 100 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.475 V along with excellent stability over 500 h accompanied with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency.

Heterogeneous structured Ni3Se2/MoO2@Ni12P5 catalyst for durable urea oxidation reaction	MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS												The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an attractive alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction that can be used in hydrogen production. Herein, we propose a new composite catalyst via a two-step method, including the in-situ growth of Ni12P5 on the nickel foam (NF) substrate, and subsequently, the Ni3Se2/MoO2@Ni12P5/NF catalyst is synthesized by the rapid electrodeposition of Ni3Se2/MoO2 on the Ni12P5. The prepared Ni3Se2/MoO2@Ni12P5/NF demonstrates a hierarchical and heterogeneous structure with abundant Schottky vacancies, displaying an ultra-low potential of 1.277 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel value of 53.8 mV dec(-1), which are comparable to those of noble metal-based catalysts. In addition, the performance retention is 97.4% after the durability test for 120 h, demonstrating its remarkable stability for the UOR. The electrochemical results show that Schottky vacancies are beneficial to the adsorption of OH- and release O-2 from the electrode surface, leading to the enhanced catalytic performance.

Herein, 3D antler-like VC-Co 3 O 4 /CoSe 2 arrays grown on Ni foam with abundant O and Se dual vacancies were constructed via a hydrothermal approach followed by etching engineering. The rich oxygen vacancies optimize the adsorption of intermediates, increase the number of active sites, and reduce charge transfer impedance. Meanwhile, Se vacancies can effectively regulate the electronic structures to enhance the intrinsic activities of active sites, which further promote the electrocatalytic performance. Thanks to the synergistic effect of dual vacancies, the designed VC-Co 3 O 4 /CoSe 2 /NF catalyst presents enhanced catalytic activity for OER, with reduced overpotential of 263 mV to achieve a current density of 30 mA cm -2 . Moreover, VC-Co 3 O 4 /CoSe 2 /NF also demonstrates remarkable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) performance, which just requires a low potential of 1.43 and 1.36 V at 30 mA cm -2 , respectively, and maintains long-term durability over 65 h. More importantly, the VC-Co 3 O 4 / CoSe 2 /NF is assembled into a cell, the GOR//HER system supplies a lower cell voltage of 1.47 V to afford 10 mA cm -2 in comparison with OER//HER. This work opens up a promising avenue for the development of highefficiency and low-cost multifunction electrocatalysts to promote the sustainable development for hydrogen production.																			0360-3199	1879-3487				JUN 19	2024	71						1230	1241		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.286		MAY 2024											WOS:001246301700001

However, due to the intrinsically sluggish six-electron transfer process, the efficiency of UOR is still not satisfied. In response, we synthesized a bimetallic NiFe-MIL-53-NH2 with superior activity toward UOR, which only needs a low potential of 1.398 V vs. RHE to obtain 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, much lower than that in 1.0 M KOH (1.721 V vs. RHE). Furthermore, NiFe-MIL-53-NH2 presents significantly more excellent UOR activity compared to its monometallic counterparts. The TOF value in NiFe-MIL-53-NH2 (0.16 s(-1)) at 1.4 V vs. RHE is about 133- and 246-folds higher than that Ni-MIL-53-NH2 (1.2 x 10(-3) s(-1)) and Fe-MIL-53-NH2 (6.5 x 10(-)(4) s(-1)), respectively. XPS characterization discloses that the incorporation of Fe into Ni-MIL-53-NH2 framework optimizes the local charge distribution of metal nodes, leading to the formation of electrophilic Ni3+ and nucleophilic Fe3+ species, which can absorb electron-donating -NH2 and electron-withdrawing C = O groups in urea, respectively, and therefore result in excellent UOR. This simple strategy of regulating local charge distribution of active species by fabricating bimetallic MOFs provides a new strategy and direction to explore other highly efficient UOR electrocatalysts.																			1385-8947	1873-3212				APR 1	2022	433		2						133515	10.1016/j.cej.2021.133515	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.133515		FEB 2022											WOS:000784267200002

However, the nascent idea is limited by the energy burden of threshold voltage and the sluggish reaction kinetics involving a six-electron transfer mechanism. Herein, for the first time, the engineering of electrocatalysts are proposed with simultaneous inclusion of UOR activator and UOR accelerator. Nitrogen-doped carbon-decorated Ni-based Metal Organic Framework (MOF) has been synthesized as the base catalyst material. MoO2 and rGO with varied loading have been attached to the MOF to get the desired MoO2/Ni-MOF/rGO heterostructure incorporating defects and crystal strain within the materials. Investigations reveal that the invoked lattice strain and atomic defects promote plenteous Ni3+ active sites. The optimized sample demonstrates extraordinary performance of UOR having the potential value as low as 1.32 V versus RHE to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the tafel slope is only 31 mV dec(-1) reflecting very fast reaction kinetics. Here MoO2 plays the role of UOR activator whereas optimized loading of rGO proliferates the reaction speed. This work, experimentally and theoretically, presents a new insight to enhance electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction opening an avenue of urea-based energy-harvesting technology.

Surface modification is an effective strategy to tune the catalytic activity of the catalysts towards UOR. Here, we developed a facile and universal quenching strategy to prepare sulfate-modified NiO nanosheets (NiO@NF-20S). Compared with the pristine NiO nanosheets, the electrocatalytic performance of the NiO@NF-20S is greatly improved, showing a small potential of 1.40 V vs. RHE to deliver a current density of 200 mA cm-2 as well as robust electrochemical stability. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of the NiO@NF-20S is mainly ascribed to the improved surface wettability and the promoted Ni2+/Ni3+ redox reaction. The quenching strategy can be expanded to not only various kinds of functional groups from nitric acid and phosphoric acid but also other metal oxides such as NiCoOx and NiCrOx. This work provides a new avenue to the design of surface-functionalized metal oxide catalysts for electrocatalysis.

CuO-Doped Catalyst Synthesized from Red Mud and Rice Husk Ash Using Urea-Nitrate Combustion Technique for p-Xylene Deep Oxidation	MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS												To propose an effective CuO-doped catalyst fabricated from red mud and rice hush ash for deep oxidation and emphasize the relation between properties and activity of catalysts, in this work, 5 mass% CuO-doped materials fabricated from red mud and rice husk ash were synthesized using urea/nitrate combustion technique. Effect of urea/nitrate molar ratios on properties and activity of prepared material in p-xylene deep oxidation was also investigated. The obtained catalysts were characterized by several techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and Hydrogen Temperature Program Reduction (H-2-TPR). The results showed that the change in urea/nitrate ratio could reduce CuO crystallite size of catalyst and enhance its reducibility leading to an increase of catalyst's oxidative activity. The 5 mass% CuO-doped material with nanoparticles of about 20 nm synthesized with urea/nitrate molar ratio of 2 showed the best activity in p-xylene deep oxidation at the temperature range of 275-400 degrees C. The deep oxidation of p-xylene to CO2 was almost complete at 400 degrees C and WHSVof 12,000 mL.h(1)1.g(1)1. This study found an alternative, low-cost and friendly way for the exploitation of catalyst based on waste materials - red mud and rice husk ash. The modification of CuO-doped material by using urea as a fuel in the preparation is one of the most promising approaches, toward the development of effective VOCs oxidation. The cheap catalyst obtained in this work can be applied in the treatment of VOCs in polluted air.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) draws specific attention not only because of its lower theoretical voltage of 0.37 V compared with OER (1.23 V), but also for treating sewage water. Herein, Ni/NiO nanosheets with an ultrathin N-doped C layer containing a Schottky Ni and NiO heterointerface is constructed. Because of the self-driven charge redistribution at the heterointerface, janus charge domains are successfully created to drive the cleavage of urea molecules. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between N-doped C and Ni/NiO restrains the deactivation of active sites in alkaline solution. The catalyst displays 1.35 V for UOR at 10 mA/cm(2), 0.27 V lower than that of OER. The final potential increase is only 2 mV after long-term stability test of 12 h for UOR, much smaller than the uncoated sample (38 mV). The present work shows that C-coated transition metal nanomaterials with oxygen vacancies and a Schottky heterointerface are promising candidates for simultaneously boosting UOR with both high activity and long-term stability.

In this work, a ferrocene (Fc)-based metal organic framework (MOF) was rationally phosphorized to construct a CoFeP/MOF composite electrocatalyst. Thanks to the excellent conductivity, high specific surface area, and rich heterojunction interfaces, the prepared catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity and long-term endurance, which can realize 50 mA cm-- 2 at an overpotential of 246 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH and a cell potential of 1.441 V (vs. RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea. The electrolyzer assembled from the prepared electrode and Pt/C electrode can drive 50 mA cm-- 2 at 1.605 V and 1.524 V (vs. RHE) in the overall/urea-assisted water splitting tests, demonstrating great application prospects.

J	Peng, YY; Wu, MS				Peng, Yuan-Yu; Wu, Mao-Sung			Flower-like manganese oxide with intercalated nickel ions (Ni<SUP>3+</SUP>) as a catalytic electrode material for urea oxidation	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												The Na+-intercalated manganese oxide nanoflowers and Na+-free manganese oxide nanoparticles were anodically electrodeposited on carbon fibers from manganese (II) acetate solutions with and without sodium sulfate, respectively. After intercalation of nickel ions, the Na+-intercalated manganese oxide remained its original form of nanoflowers (denoted as MnO2/Na/Ni), while the Na+-free manganese oxide underwent severe deformation to form a dense film with aggregated nanoparticles (denoted as MnO2/Ni). It was evident that the preintercalated Na+ ions were replaced with Ni3+ ions which were inserted in the interstitial space of the tunnel-structured manganese oxide. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that the well-dispersed Ni3+ species in MnO2/Na/Ni could behave as a catalytic center for facilitating the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in an alkaline electrolyte, resulting in superior catalytic capability than the MnO2/Ni and bulk Ni(OH)(2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that an impressive electrocatalytic activity of MnO2/Na/Ni electrode was largely ascribed to its lower charge-transfer resistance of the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox reaction in indirect UOR process and smaller direct UOR resistance on Ni3+ catalyst than the MnO2/Ni electrode with aggregated catalyst layer.																			0013-4686	1873-3859				APR 1	2022	410								140022	10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140022													WOS:000778660700002

Herein, the vanadium-doped Ni4N@CuCoN0.6 heterostructure with brush shape structure supported on copper foam (denoted as V-doped-Ni4N@CuCoN0.6/CF) is prepared to serve as a highly-performing UOR electrocatalyst at high current density (E10/500/1000 = 1.26/1.40/ 1.45 V). Thanks to the construction of heterojunction, the local charge density undergoes redistribution at the Vdoped-Ni4N@CuCoN0.6/CF interface between Ni4N and CuCoN0.6, thereby significantly enriching the active site and facilitating the adsorption process of urea molecules in a 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M urea solution. Notably, Vdoping exerts an additional influence by modulating the electronic structure of the catalyst, potentially optimizing the urea adsorption/CO2 desorption process and reducing the energy barrier for the rate-determining step. Operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results show direct oxidation for urea molecules on the surface of V-doped-Ni4N@CuCoN0.6/CF, indicating that V-doping and heterostructure can effectively improve electron transfer. Furthermore, because the brush shape structure can be beneficial for bubble release and liquid transport on the catalyst's surface, for UOR stability, V-doped-Ni4N@CuCoN0.6/CF can maintain at 500 mA cm- 2 for 80 h. Overall, this work suggests a highly-performing UOR electrocatalyst and provides a promising strategy for developing highly-efficient catalysts for UOR applications.

J	Zhang, Z; Yang, JG; Liu, JY; Gu, ZG; Yan, XD				Zhang, Zhe; Yang, Jingguo; Liu, Jiangyong; Gu, Zhi-Guo; Yan, Xiaodong			Sulfur-doped NiCo carbonate hydroxide with surface sulfate groups for highly enhanced electro-oxidation of urea	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												NiCo-based hydroxides are promising catalysts for urea oxidation reaction. To further enhance their catalytic performance, the combined effect of nonmetal heteroatom doping and surface functional groups on their catalytic behaviors deserves to be evaluated. Herein, as a proof of concept, both the sulfur-doped NiCo(OH)(2)CO3 with surface sulfate groups (SS-NiCo) and the surface-sulfated NiCo(OH)(2)CO3 (S-NiCo) are synthesized by hydrothermal method. The effect of sulfur doping and surface sulfate treatment on the morphology, crystal structure, electronic structure and electrochemical properties is comprehensively studied. It is found that both the incorporation of sulfur into the crystal structure and the introduction of surface sulfate groups can tune the electronic structure and thus promotes the intrinsic activity of the NiCo(OH)(2)CO3. Additionally, the surface sulfate groups can effectively reduce the series resistance and thus enhance the charge transfer/reaction kinetics. The optimized SS-NiCo catalyst delivers a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.34 V vs RHE, which is much smaller than those of the S-NiCo (1.38 V) and the pristine NiCo(OH)(2)CO3 (1.43 V). In addition, the SS-NiCo catalyst shows good performance in the urea-assisted water electrolysis for hydrogen production.

For the successful application of this technology, advanced electrocatalysts for UOR must be developed to overcome the high overpotential. This can be achieved by introducing Co into Ni-based catalysts. Normally, an optimum ratio of Ni:Co would show the highest activity; however, a higher content of Co adversely affects the catalyst performance. In this study, we provide an explanation for the optimum point in NiCo-based catalysts. In addition to the positive effect of reducing the UOR onset potential, electrochemical analyses suggested that an electro-inactive species for UOR was formed by doping with Co, and this species exerted its influence more strongly as the content of Co increased. Thus, the performance was maximized at an optimum ratio of Ni:Co, at which the advantages and disadvantages of Co-doping were balanced. The results of our study indicated that Co -doping at 10 at% showed the highest UOR catalytic activity as proven by the electrochemical measurements.

Enhanced electro-oxidation of urea based on nickel nanoparticle decorated reduced graphene oxide/PEDOT:PSS composite	SCIENTIA IRANICA												A facile two-step systematic plan of action was used to prepare nanocomposite of Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) decorated with nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs) onto a Glassy Carbon Electrode (GCE). Composites of PEDOT:PSS and RGO were prepared by mixing each component solution and were fabricated as a beneficial substrate for Ni NPs. Ni NPs were electrodeposited on the PEDOT-RGO support by applying constant potential into nickel ions solutions. Then, Ni/PEDOT-RGO/GCE was employed as an efficient electrocatalyst for electrooxidation of urea. The electrocatalytic properties of Ni NPs/PEDOT-RGO modified glassy carbon electrode toward the oxidation of urea were analyzed by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). Such studies evidenced the high electrocatalytic activity of Ni NPs and mixed PEDOT-RGO, which is mainly ascribed to the good electrochemical activity of PEDOT-RGO composites and the well-dispersed Ni NPs on the surface of PEDOT-RGO composite.

The use of electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) technology to treat wastewater containing urea has gained considerable significance. The regulation of the composition and electronic properties of the catalyst by doping transition metal elements is crucial for the development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and UOR catalysts with high catalytic activity. In this paper, WSe2, CoSe2, NiWSe2 and CoSe2/NiWSe2 were synthesized by hydrothermal method combined with annealing treatment. Compared with WSe2, CoSe2, and NiWSe2, the OER and UOR catalytic activity of CoSe2/NiWSe2 are significantly improved. For OER, a low overpotential of 1.44 V is all that is needed to reach a current density of 10 mA cm -2. The overpotential of UOR is only 1.32 @ 10 mA cm -2, and it can still maintain excellent electrochemical stability after 30 h. The electronic structure of CoSe2/NiWSe2 is changed by the incorporation of Co, thereby improving the conductivity and accelerating the reaction kinetics. CoSe2 particles are uniformly distributed on the layered NiWSe2 nanosheets, which promotes the charge transfer and synergistic effect at the interface between CoSe2 and NiWSe2. The nanoflower-like structure with thin edges enriches the active sites of CoSe2/NiWSe2. Therefore, the transition metal element doping technology can provide a new method for the development of efficient OER and UOR electrocatalysts and provide a new way to reduce the overall energy consumption during urea degradation.

Unveiling the Role of Iron in the Nickel-Catalyzed Urea Oxidation Reaction	ACS CATALYSIS												The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) on Ni has recently attracted much attention as part of the global effort to produce hydrogen from waste. Fe addition to Ni (hydro)oxides results in a significant enhancement of the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and a similar role of Fe in the UOR has often been claimed. In this work, we explore the influence of Fe3+ ions in the electrolyte on the alkaline UOR on Ni. To this end, we systematically increase the concentration of the Fe3+ ions in NaOH and incorporate them in the Ni(OH)(2) layer grown on the electrode by electrochemical potential cycling. We then determine the fraction of Fe on the Ni(OH)(2) surface by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and investigate the UOR by cyclic voltammetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) depending on the Fe fraction. We conclude that contrary to the OER, the presence of Fe is detrimental for the UOR. We then discuss the influence of the potential and Fe on the product distribution revealed by FTIRS.

In this study, Ni-WxC/C (x = 1,2) composite with high activity for urea electrocatalysis was prepared by direct electro-reduction of affordable feedstock of NiO-CaWO4-C in molten CaCl2-NaCl at 873-973 K. The addition of graphite in precursor decreases the particle size of Ni. Introducing WxC into Ni particles can reduce the overpotential for UOR. As a result, the obtained Ni-WxC/graphite composite exhibits high current density for urea oxidation, which is about 11-folds and 52-folds higher than that of Ni/graphite and Ni (@1.53 V vs. RHE), respectively. After changing the carbon source from graphite to CNTs, the anodic current density was further increased by 43%, reaching 50.31 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the cathodic catalyst WxC/CNTs obtained by the same preparation process exhibits high performance towards HER, with a low onset potential of 131.5 mV and a Tafel slope of 69.5 mV dec(-1). Assembling an electrolyzer using Ni-WxC/CNTs as anode and WxC/CNTs as cathode can yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at merely 1.65 V in 1 M KOH/0.33 M urea aqueous solution, with excellent long-term electrochemical durability. The environmental-friendly production process uses affordable feedstocks for the synthesis of efficient catalysts toward urea electrolysis, promising an energy-saving hydrogen production as well as waste treatment.

However, as the common critical anodes for the electrooxidation of methanol and urea, most Ni-based catalysts are severely poisoned by the CO group, resulting in a decrease in current densities and stability of fuel cells. Herein, efficient bacterial cellulose (BC)-derived carbon aerogel loaded with Ni-based catalyst and WC nanoparticles co-catalyst was developed for the electrooxidation of methanol and urea. As a result, the catalytic electrode exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for methanol electrooxidation (105.7 mA cm-2 at 0.8 V) and urea electrooxidation (90.4 mA cm-2 at 0.8 V). The synergistic effect between Ni and WC can significantly weaken the surface adsorption of CO on the electrode to obtain excellent and durable electrochemical performance. For methanol oxidation reaction and urea oxidation reaction, the retentions of the peak cur-rent density after 2000 cycles in the original electrolytes are 48.94% and 74.79%, respectively. Moreover, applying the new electrolyte, the peak current density can return to 88.42% and 84.4% of the original value. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Electrocatalytic performance of different ratios of NiCo LDHs was further determined to exploring electrochemical reaction pathway and thermodynamic mechanism. Results indicate appropriate Co element doping content in Ni hydroxide could greatly improve UOR performance. Results of XPS and in situ Raman indicate only part of NiCo hydroxides were converted to NiCo oxyhydroxides which drive the subsequent UOR. Moreover, electrocatalytic UOR on NiCo oxyhydroxides is found in competition with redox of NiCo hydroxides. Density function theory (DFT) calculation manifests that the energy barrier of UOR on NiCo oxyhydroxides is lower than redox of NiCo hydroxides which become the limitation reaction. Energy barrier gap between UOR and redox which provide driving force for UOR which is the primary cause of fast kinetic.

Ammonium and urea, two reduced forms of anthropogenic N commonly observed, are the preferred substrates for various microorganisms (e.g., uptake by phytoplankton or bacteria and oxidation by nitrifier). Yet, it remains underexplored how they transform and their concentrations vary during transport in the estuary which may influence the offshore microbial community. We applied N-15 isotope tracer incubation techniques to determine the two main bio-consumption processes, i.e., uptake and oxidation, of ammonium and urea, in the dark for the Jiulong River Estuary, a eutrophic estuary in southeastern China. Results showed that light penetration depth ranged from 0.8-3.3 m leaving 76% of estuary water bodies to stay in dark situations throughout a day. Ammonia oxidation, which favors dark conditions, dominates the estuarine regenerated-N cycle, showing the rank: ammonia oxidation > ammonium uptake >> urea uptake approximate to urea oxidation. By compiling the reported case studies, we found the relatively low ratio of urea oxidation to ammonia oxidation was accompanied by a relatively high ammonium concentration. Microorganisms' high preference for ammonium over urea may lead to an inhibitory-like phenomenon. An analogous effect was evident by the increased urea uptake at downstream when ammonium was down to a few mu M. The obstructed urea utilization resulted in 10 times longer lifetime for urea relative to ammonium (surface: 19 +/- 9 days; bottom 12 +/- 7 days). Such an inhibitory-like effect allows urea to be preserved in the estuary and allows urea to be transported farther offshore to stimulate microorganisms capable of utilizing urea, which may have significant impacts on offshore ecology.					han, lili/LUW-6774-2024; Tang, Jin-Ming/IAR-4698-2023; 邹, 文斌/HWQ-8314-2023; Kao, Shuh-Ji/F-8418-2015; Xu, Min/N-6142-2018	Lin, Yuxuan/0000-0002-5651-8816; Kao, Shuh-Ji/0000-0002-5054-9099; Xu, Min/0000-0002-4345-8375; Tang, Jin-Ming/0000-0002-7001-7700														2296-7745				DEC 12	2022	9								1040554	10.3389/fmars.2022.1040554	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.1040554													WOS:000901906100001

In this study, nickel-tellurium (Ni -Te) grown on 3D nickel foam was successfully synthesized using a simple and facile electrodeposition method. The electrodeposition process of Ni -Te follows the three-dimensional instantaneous nucleation/growth mechanism controlled by diffusion. The apparent activation energy ( E a ) of Ni -Te in the electrodeposition process is as low as 36.5 kJ center dot mol -1 . Lattice distortion structure obtained by electrodeposition modifies the intrinsic electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption energy of intermediates.

In this work, the composite (Cr-NiO/CWF) was synthesized by anchoring Cr and NiO onto carbonized wood fiber (CWF) by hydrothermal method combined with pyrolysis, utilizing biomass wood fiber (WF) as the precursor for the carbon substrate. The optimal Cr-NiO/CWF has significant UOR activity, and the current density (j) can reach 310.40 mA cm(-2) at 1.67 V, while the required potential for UOR is 1.36 V at the j value of 10 mA cm(-2). After 12 h of long-term chronoamperometry (CA) testing, the j retention rate of Cr-NiO/CWF is 90 %. The excellent properties of Cr-NiO/CWF composites are mainly ascribed to the effective modulation of the electronic structure by Cr doping, which optimizes the adsorption behavior of the reactants and products.

Moreover, the effects of VO and Mo (V) species on UOR activity are investigated. It is found that the VO-rich CoMoO4@NF arrays exhibit an excellent current efficiency of 144.29 mA cm(-2) at 550 mV for UOR, which is about 7 times higher than that of the VO-poor CoMoO4@NF arrays. The remarkably improved activity of VO-rich CoMoO4@NF arrays is mainly attributed to the high VO concentration, as well associated Mo (V). VO as the active sites for the adsorption and activation of urea and Mo (V) sites as an electron transfer bridge have greatly enhanced the UOR activity. This work demonstrates that accurate control of VO concentration, as well associated metal species, favors for the development of efficient non-precious metals catalysts.

However, achieving efficient electrochemical urea oxidation remains a formidable challenge, and development of an improved electrocatalyst with an optimal physicochemical and electronic structure toward urea oxidation is desired. This can be accomplished by designing a tailored two-dimensional composite with an abundance of active sites in a favorable electronic environment. In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported, electrochemically grown metal/mixed metal hydroxide composite interface via a two-step electrodeposition method. Specifically, Ni(OH)2 was electrodeposited on the top of the CuCo layer (Ni(OH)2/CuCo/Ni(OH)2), and the resultant 2D composite structure required 1.333 +/- 0.006 V to oxidize urea electrochemically to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which outperformed the potential required for individual components, Ni(OH)2 and CuCo. The high density of Ni3+ active sites in the composite structure facilitated high electrocatalyst activity and stability. Ni(OH)2/CuCo/Ni(OH)2 was stable for at least 50 h without any noticeable degradation in the activity or alteration of the morphology. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the material also exhibited excellent performance for water oxidation with 260 mV overpotential and 50 h stability. In a two-electrode configuration coupled with a NiMo cathode catalyst, the electrolyzer required 1.42 V cell voltage for overall urea splitting. Overall, the engineered Ni(OH)2/CuCo/Ni(OH)2 composite demonstrated exceptional potential as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for both urea and water oxidation reactions, paving the way for more effective hydrogen production technologies.

However, the slow kinetics of UOR restricts its wide application. Therefore, it is of great significance to design and prepare cheap and high-performance non-noble metal based UOR catalysts. In this work, Ni/NiO-NiWO4-2 sample prepared by solvent evaporation method has a mesoporous feature verified by the structural characterization, which is conducive to electrolyte diffusion and electron transport. Electrochemical tests show that the Ni/NiO-NiWO4-2 sample has good UOR catalytic activity, namely, the potential required by UOR is 1.669 V (vs RHE) at the current density of 270.44 mA cm- 2. The excellent performance of Ni/NiO-NiWO4-2 is ascribed to that its mesoporous structure facilitates the diffusion of the electrolyte and exposes more active areas, the existence of metal W weakens the poisoning of Ni3+ active components and reduces the energy barrier of UOR confirmed by density functional theory, thus enhancing the performance of UOR.																			0360-3199	1879-3487				OCT 4	2024	85						261	269		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.08.359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.08.359		AUG 2024											WOS:001301513400001

Else, electrocatalytic methodologies have the potential to transform urea present in urea-rich wastewater into hydrogen, thereby contributing towards environmental conservation and facilitating the production of sustainable energy. The characterization of the NiCo2O4@chitosan catalyst was performed by various analytical techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the activity of electrodes toward urea removal was investigated by several electrochemical techniques. As a function of current density, the performance of the modified NiCo2O4@chitosan surface was employed to remove urea using electrochemical oxidation. Consequently, the current density measurement was 43 mA cm(-2) in a solution of 1.0 M urea and 1.0 M KOH. Different kinetic characteristics were investigated, including charge transfer coefficient (a), Tafel slope (29 mV dec(-1)), diffusion coefficient (1.87 x 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1)), and surface coverage 4.29 x 10(-9) mol cm(-2). The electrode showed high stability whereas it lost 10.4% of its initial current after 5 h of urea oxidation.

Amorphous-crystalline (A-C) heterostructures have attracted extensive attention owing to their highly exposed active sites and superior stability. However, the complicated synthesis approach and inefficient A-C boundary severely limit their industrial application in UOR electrolysis. In this study, a simple hydrothermal method was reported to fabricate novel heterostructure nanoarrays comprising NiSe nanorods evenly integrated with nickel-terephthalic acid (Ni-TPA) nanosheets. In the A-C heterostructure electrocatalyst, highly conductive NiSe nanorods facilitate axial charge transfer in the interconnection network. TPA-induced formation of crystalline-amorphous heterostructures exposes more active sites and regulates the electronic structure of Ni. As expected, the optimal Ni-TPA@NiSe/NF electrode presents a low potential of 1.37 V to deliver 100 mA cm-2 for UOR while maintaining impressively robust stability at high current densities for at least 40 h. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry analyses reveal that the superior UOR activity originates from NiOOH species and the terminal product of nitrogen is generated via intramolecular N-N coupling in the urea molecule. More importantly, this study offers deep insights into designing and fabricating effective UOR electrocatalysts with abundant A-C grain boundaries.					lu, jm/JPK-3675-2023; Jin, Liujun/AHB-8216-2022; gu, peiyang/HJH-4059-2023; He, Jinghui/A-6813-2017	Jin, Liujun/0009-0002-1916-1501; Jin, Liujun/0009-0009-3331-0199													2155-5435					JAN 6	2023	13	1					837	847		10.1021/acscatal.2c05546	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c05546		DEC 2022											WOS:000911006100001

Herein, a kind of novel bifunctional NiPx/MoS2/CC hybrid catalyst can be fabricated via a hydrothermal method followed by a facile in-situ electrodeposition process. The prepared NiPx/MoS2/CC catalyst exhibits an overpotential of only 88 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER while the potential for UOR was only 1.36 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Further, the urea electrolytic cell assembled of the NiPx/MoS2/CC catalyst displays low potential (1.45 V@10 mA cm(-2)) and better long-term durability. The improved electrocatalytic performances are mainly attributed to the intimately coupled interface between NiPx and MoS2, enormously improving the conductivity and increasing the heterogenous interface active area. Additionally, the closely incorporated heterogeneous interfaces trigger charge redistribution, which induces the fast electron transfer from the NiPx to MoS2. In a word, the present results can provide a feasible research strategy for design advanced multi-functional catalysts via interfacial engineering for clean energy conversion applications.																			1867-3880	1867-3899				MAR 8	2024	16	5								10.1002/cctc.202301420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301420		JAN 2024											WOS:001152112700001

Electrochemical water splitting is a promising method for generating carbon-free hydrogen. However, the relatively high overpotential of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the main obstacle hindering the widespread popularity of water electrocatalysis technology. Recently, urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has gained significant attention as a potential alternative to OER for hydrogen production since the equilibrium potential of UOR is 0.86 V lower than that of OER. Transition metal-based layered double hydroxides (TM-LDHs) have been explored as promising UOR electrocatalysts, with the advantages of diversified metal species, stable twodimensional layered structure and exchangeability of interlayer anions. To date, most studies have focused on TM-LDHs of late transition metals (e.g., Ni, Co, and Fe). In this work, by combining early and late transition metals, CoV-LDHs nanosheets were fabricated via a simple one-step coprecipitation method as high-performance UOR electrocatalysts. Additionally, cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)), with a similar lamellar structure, was synthesized via the same method. When compared with Co(OH)(2), CoV-LDHs nanosheets exhibited better UOR performance owing to the following advantages: 1) The nanosheet structure of the as-fabricated CoV-LDHs electrocatalyst exposed a high number of active sites for the electrocatalytic conversion of urea. 2) The introduction of V enhanced the wettability of the CoV-LDHs electrocatalyst; thus, increasing its intrinsic electrocatalytic kinetics. 3) The d-electron compensation effect between Co (3d(7)4s(2)) and V (3d(3)4s(2)) was conducive to promoting the adsorption of urea. Therefore, the CoV-LDHs electrocatalyst exhibited a low electrochemical potential (1.52 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) to achieve a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in 1 mol center dot L-1 of potassium hydroxide containing 0.33 mol center dot L-1 urea, which was 70 mV less than that of Co(OH)(2). The Tafel slope value of the CoV-LDHs electrocatalyst (99.9 mV center dot dec(-1)) was lower than that of Co(OH)(2) (115.9 mV center dot dec(-1)), indicating faster UOR kinetics over the CoV-LDHs electrocatalyst. Furthermore, the CoV-LDHs electrocatalyst displayed high stability, with a negligible potential increase after a 10-h chronopotentiometry test by maintaining the current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2). In conclusion, the present work not only shows that the d-electron compensation effect between early and late transition metals could adjust the local electronic structure of TM-LDHs to improve the UOR efficiency, but also provides a feasible route to design dedicated nanostructured TM-LDHs as high-performance UOR electrocatalysts.

The present study utilizes bio-based mesoporous carbon as a carbon source to synthesize QDs carbon nanostructures (Co3O4/BMC400) through hydrothermal and carbonization methods. Due to the abundance of active sites and limited availability of Co, the size of Co particles is confined to the QDs level, ranging from 2 to 3 nm. The anodic oxidation reaction of the Co3O4/BMC-400 was investigated in freshwater, seawater, and urea. The prepared Co3O4/BMC-400 exhibits an oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of 235 mV at 10 mA cm- 2 in 1.0 M KOH. The catalytic activity is reduced as a result of the competitive oxidation and corrosion caused by chloride ions in seawater. For the urea oxidation reaction, Co3O4/BMC-400 exhibits superior catalytic performance, requiring only a potential of 1.371 V at 10 mA cm- 2, while exhibiting remarkable long-term stability for up to 30 h. More significantly, in comparison to Co3O4 nanosheets and nanoparticles, QDs can effectively reduce the transport pathways of alkali metal ions, thereby affording an increased number of catalytic active sites while simultaneously enhancing stability and prolonging service life. These findings may facilitate further exploration of metal-QDs/carbon materials in a wide range of electrocatalytic application.

Nevertheless, the development of cost-effective, highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for MOR and UOR remains a significant challenge. Herein, the Ohmic junction (Ni-CuCoN0.6@CC) comprising CuCoN0.6 nanosheets and Ni nanoparticles anchored on carbon cloth (CC) was successfully synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal process followed by pyrolysis. The Ni-CuCoN0.6@CC demonstrates exceptional performance in both MOR (1.334 V@10 mA cm(-2)) and UOR (1.335 V@10 mA cm(-2)), coupled with outstanding durability, maintaining 88.70 % current density for MOR and 88.92 % for UOR after a rigorous 50-h stability test. Furthermore, the Ni-CuCoN0.6@CC demonstrates a high selectivity for oxidizing methanol to formic acid, achieving Faraday efficiencies exceeding 90 % at various current densities in the context of MOR. The outstanding performance of Ni-CuCoN0(.6)@CC in terms of MOR and UOR either surpasses or closely approaches the levels reported in previous literature, primarily due to the synergistic effect resulting from the Ohmic junction: in this system, Ni serves as the principal active component, Co augments catalytic activity and diminishes onset potential, while Cu enhances long-term durability. Moreover, CuCoN0.6 nanosheets effectively modulate electronic structure and optimize the morphology of Ni, leading to the exposure of numerous defects that provide a wealth of active sites for the reaction. Additionally, the exceptional hydrophilic and aerophobic surface promotes enhanced mass transfer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Ni-CuCoN0.6@CC enhances reactant adsorption and product desorption, reducing energy barriers and expediting MOR and UOR kinetics.					zhang, Yanxia/F-5199-2011														0021-9797	1095-7103				JAN	2025	677		B				597	607		10.1016/j.jcis.2024.08.086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.08.086		AUG 2024						39154451					WOS:001320911000001

Herein, a novel flexible, self-supported NiF3-Ni2P heterostructure in-situ grown on carbon cloth (NiF3/Ni2P@CC) is controllable synthesized by hydrothermal and subsequent successive fluorination-phosphorization method. The as-obtained optimized NiF3/Ni2P@CC-2 is featured by large amounts of high valent Ni3+ active sites, reconfigured local charge density, superior hydrophilic surface and mesoporous property.

Here, a hierarchical structure with intimate interfaces derived from two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) was constructed by partial sulfurization for urea oxidation. The sulfurization treatment increases the specific surface area, remarkably improving the mass transfer and the exposure of active sites. Moreover, the hybridization at the interface induces electron redistribution and facilitates the electron transfer as confirmed by experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. The optimal catalyst delivers enhanced catalytic activity and durability, achieving a low driving potential of 1.326 V (vs. RHE) for urea oxidation at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and negligible activity loss after durability test, which outperforms most previously reported non-precious catalysts. Our results demonstrate the great potential of MOF-derived materials as efficient catalysts for costeffective hydrogen production and urea fuel cells, offering bright prospect for energy-sustainable developments and mitigating water contamination.

In particular, the abundant availability along with improved electrochemical performance is crucial for fuel cell applications when it comes to large scale commercialization. In this work, we report the synthesis of a trimetallic metal-organic framework based on Ni, Co and Zn using BTC as a linker and the preparation of its metal oxide - carbon composites at different temperatures, 600, 700 and 800 degrees C (TM-MOF-600, TM-MOF-700, and TM-MOF-800) by carbonization under an inert atmosphere. The PXRD pattern of TM-MOF complemented well with the simulated XRD patterns of Co-Ni-BTC MOF as well as Zn-BTC MOF, whereas the PXRD pattern of the carbonized samples indicated the presence of three types of metal oxides i.e., CoO, NiO, and ZnO. TEM indicated spherical morphology of TM-MOF, upon calcination, an irregular agglomeration occurred and the average particle size was found to be 60-110 nm. The as-prepared TM-MOF and its carbon composites were tested for their electrocatalytic as well as catalytic activities towards oxygen evolution, urea oxidation and 4-nitrophenol reduction reactions. Electrochemical results indicate the better performance of TM-MOF-800 in both OER and UOR reactions with an onset potential of 1.66 V (OER) and 1.37 V (UOR) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The long-term stability of these catalysts under alkaline conditions indicates excellent stability. Besides, the urea electrolyzed products were analyzed by gas chromatography to get clear insights on the formed products. Catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol in the presence of excess NaBH4 showed excellent conversion to 4-amino phenol in short duration. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the high catalytic activity of transition metal oxides towards UOR, various strategies have been developed to improve their syntheses and catalytic properties. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of UOR on catalyst surface. In this work, three transition metal oxides, including NiO, Co3O4, and Fe2O3 are investigated as model catalysts. Through analyzing the electrochemical properties by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and operando Raman spectroscopy, it is revealed that NiO has a unique high catalytic activity towards UOR due to simultaneous formation of a thin layer of oxyhydroxide species above 1.40 V vs. RHE in alkaline media. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations further suggest that the adsorption of urea molecules is largely affected by surface interactions resulting in different space configurations, which impose large influences on the consecutive deprotonation and N-N formation processes. Overall, results of this work point to the subtle adsorption - kinetics relationship in UOR and highlight the importance of the interfacial electronic interactions on catalyst surface.

The simple summary consists of no more than 200 words in one paragraph and contains a clear statement of the problem addressed, the aims and objectives, pertinent results, conclusions from the study, and how they will be valuable to society. This should be written for a lay audience, i.e., no technical terms without explanations. No references are cited, and no abbreviations included. Submissions without a simple summary will be returned directly. Developing renewable energy sources and controlling water pollution are critical but challenging problems. Urea oxidation (UOR) and methanol oxidation (MOR), both of which have high research value, have the potential to effectively address wastewater pollution and energy crisis problems. A three-dimensional neodymium-dioxide/nickel-selenide-modified nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet (Nd2O3-NiSe-NC) catalyst is prepared in this study by using mixed freeze-drying, salt-template-assisted technology, and high-temperature pyrolysis. The Nd2O3-NiSe-NC electrode showed good catalytic activity for MOR (peak current density similar to 145.04 mA cm(-2) and low oxidation potential similar to 1.33 V) and UOR (peak current density similar to 100.68 mA cm(-2) and low oxidation potential similar to 1.32 V); the catalyst has excellent MOR and UOR characteristics. The electrochemical reaction activity and the electron transfer rate increased because of selenide and carbon doping. Moreover, the synergistic action of neodymium oxide doping, nickel selenide, and the oxygen vacancy generated at the interface can adjust the electronic structure. The doping of rare-earth-metal oxides can also effectively adjust the electronic density of nickel selenide, allowing it to act as a cocatalyst, thus improving the catalytic activity in the UOR and MOR processes. The optimal UOR and MOR properties are achieved by adjusting the catalyst ratio and carbonization temperature. This experiment presents a straightforward synthetic method for creating a new rare-earth-based composite catalyst.																				2079-4991				MAR	2023	13	5							814	10.3390/nano13050814	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano13050814								36903691					WOS:000947121800001

Herein, dual-phased Ni0.85Se/NiSe2 coupling with N doped carbon (Ni0.85Se/NiSe2@NC-2) in situ is prepared by a solvotherma-lselenization pathway. Benefiting from the collective promotion of the dual-phased composition and the NC support, Ni0.85Se/NiSe2@NC provides abundant active sites, enhanced electrical conductivity. It delivers a current density of 252 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs RHE with a small Tafel slop of 64.4 mV dec-1 and gets a lower reaction barrier. Moreover, it requires a cell voltage of 1.46 V to approach 50 mA cm(-2), about 250 mV less than that of water electrolysis, confirming the less energy consumption. Notably, the N doped carbon protects Ni0.85Se/NiSe2 nanocrystals from aggregation leading to a faster CO2 desorption from Ni sites, which endow the Ni0.85Se/ NiSe2@NC-2 a much better working stability. The direct urea hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (DUHPFC) achieves a maximum power density of 9.09 mW cm(-2) at 20 ?.

MagnetoElectroCatalysis: A new approach for urea electro-oxidation reaction on nickel-iron oxide catalyst	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												The present work investigates the effect of external alternating magnetic field (AMF) on the electrocatalytic activity of nickel (Ni), iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), and Ni-MNP nanoparticles in the urea electro-oxidation reaction (UER) through chro-noamperometry (CA) with amplitudes of AMF between 14.9 and 88.9 mT and a frequency of 224 kHz. Results indicate that the AMF between 29.8 and 88.9 mT had a significant impact on the efficiency of UER, increasing the current obtained from Ni-MNP nanoparticles supported on carbon cloth (Ni-MNP/CC) by up to 52.5%. Moreover, a linear relationship between the UER current and AMF amplitude was observed. The significant enhancement of the current in the UER process with Ni-MNP/CC as catalyst under the AMF is attributed tothe local heat generated by MNP nanoparticles, boosting the UER process on nickel nanoparticles.

However, the lack of an appropriate cocatalyst severely restricts the improvement of photoelectrochemical activity for urea splitting. Here, we synthesize Co/Ni oxyhydroxide cocatalysts with a heterojunction configu-ration on the surface of BiVO4 films. Due to the difference in Fermi energies, CoOOH and NiOOH catalysts serve as nucleophilic and electrophilic active sites, respectively. Thus, the carbonyl group and amino group of urea can adsorb on CoOOH and NiOOH through the bridging coordination, respectively. Meanwhile, the charge transfer across CoOOH/NiOOH heterointerface improves the oxidation state of Ni species in NiOOH. The heterojunction cocatalyst and high oxidation state of Ni species promote the adsorption and fracture of chemical groups in urea molecules. Thanks to the composite design of pho-toanode, under AM1.5G illumination, the composite photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 4.93 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE under neutral conditions, which is the highest value achieved with BiVO4. The onset potential of the composite photoanode shifts negatively by 140 mV. This work demonstrates that the fabrication of heterojunction cocatalysts is an effective strategy toward urea photoelectrolysis. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, we propose a method for synthesizing a "quasi-Ce-MOF" straw-bundle composite assembled from one-dimensional (1D) nanorods. This is a method in which the MOF is directly heat-treated with a nitrogen atmosphere, and controlled partial pyrolysis results in the formation of a "quasi-MOF". It is worth noting that the "quasi-MOF" material (Ce-MOF-350) calcined at 350 degrees C maintains the porous structure of the precursor while having more exposed active centers. Therefore, the catalytic activity of Ce-MOF-350 for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is greatly improved. This material also has good long-term stability because the 1D nanorods are closely connected. Through the reasonable calcination of Ce-MOF materials, this study provides a new strategy for improving the activity of electrocatalysts and developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts.																			2168-0485					JUN 15	2020	8	23					8675	8680		10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c01800	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c01800													WOS:000541876900021

The obtained electrodes are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The catalytic performances of urea electro-oxidation in alkaline medium are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). The Ni@carbon sponge electrode exhibits three-dimensional open network structures with a large surface area. Remarkably, the Ni@carbon sponge electrode shows much higher electrocatalytic activity and lower onset oxidation potential towards urea electro-oxidation compared to a Ni/Ti flat electrode synthesized by the same procedure. The Ni@carbon sponge electrode achieves an onset oxidation potential of 0.24 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and a peak current density of 290 mA cm(-2) in 5 mol L-1 NaOH and 0.10 mol L-1 urea solutions accompanied with a desirable stability. The impressive electrocatalytic activity is largely attributed to the high intrinsic electronic conductivity, superior porous network structures and rich surface Ni active species, which can largely boost the interfacial electroactive sites and charge transfer rates for urea electro-oxidation in alkaline medium, indicating promising applications in fuel cells.

Here, an eggshell membrane (ESM) was immersed in a solution of nickel salts to form Ni(II)@ESM, which was freeze-dried and pyrolyzed to prepare the optimal Ni-N@C-400 composite. The Ni-N@C-400 composite is mesoporous network-interlaced structure, in which Ni nanocrystals are anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon. Furthermore, electrochemical tests show that Ni-N@C-400 composite has the current density (j) of 10 mA cm-2 for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) at a potential of 1.37 V vs RHE, and its performance is comparable to those reported in some literatures, which is mainly due to that the mesoporous structure of the composite facilitates the penetration of electrolyte and electron transfer, the presence of pyrrole/pyridine nitrogen in the composite provides active sites for UOR. In addition, the Ni-N@C-400 sample showed a j retention rate of 96% after a long 12 h CA cycling test, which exceeds that of commercial Pt/C, and is mainly attributed to the fact that the Ni nanocrystals are anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon to avoid shedding of the active components. Based on the excellent UOR performance, Ni-N@C-400 composite is expected to be a potential inexpensive UOR electrocatalyst.																			0169-4332	1873-5584				JAN 30	2023	609								155457	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.155457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.155457		OCT 2022											WOS:000881087300002

Nickel-based catalysts are widely used for urea-ORR, but in all cases, the nickel must be hybridized with carbon materials to improve its conductivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the synthesis of a nickel-decorated carbon nanotube (Ni-NCNT) by simple microwave pyrolysis of Dabco (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)-based coordination polymer frameworks (CPF). The surface structure, morphology and chemical composition of Ni-NCNT were characterized by Raman spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. SEM studies showed micrometer-long bamboo-shaped CNTs with nickel nanoparticles anchored to the walls and inside the nanotubes. A structural study by TEM and Raman spectra showed that carbon nanotubes are rich in defects due to the presence of nitrogen, and this was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps. When applied as electrocatalysts in urea oxidation reactions (UOR), our newly developed Ni-NCNT shows excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability, making it a versatile catalyst in energy generation and mitigating water contamination.

J	Fang, ZY; Liang, XL; Lu, LH; Chen, W				Fang, Zhongying; Liang, Xiaolong; Lu, Lehui; Chen, Wei			Oxygen-Containing Anions Promote the Electrocatalytic Activity of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH for The Urea Oxidation	PARTICLE & PARTICLE SYSTEMS CHARACTERIZATION												The electrocatalytic oxidation of urea (EOU) is an important half-reaction in water splitting, urea fuel cells, and urea wastewater treatment. The anions of nickel-based catalysts can be leached severely in the oxidation potential range. Therefore, the influence of anion on the electrocatalytic performance of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH for urea oxidation has not been systematically studied. The present experimental results show that the structure reconstruction of catalyst is a complicated process, specifically including deep penetration by alkaline electrolyte, leaching-induced oxidation by phosphorus or sulfur anions, transformation or cracking of the original structure, and formation of an amorphous layer on the surface. The reconstructed NF-NiPx-R or NF-NiSx-R has a three-layer core-shell structure, with a nickel foam skeleton in the innermost layer, an amorphous NiP(x )or NiSx layer in the middle layer, the outermost layer of oxygen-containing anion (POx or SOx) coordinated Ni(OH)(2). In the prepared catalyst, the Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox is the real catalytic species for the urea oxidation. It is found that the oxygen-containing anion can enhance the catalytic performance of the Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox, and POx anion has the best enhancing effect.

J	Singh, RK; Rajavelu, K; Montag, M; Schechter, A				Singh, Ramesh K.; Rajavelu, Kalaiyarasi; Montag, Michael; Schechter, Alex			Advances in Catalytic Electrooxidation of Urea: A Review	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY												The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is technologically important for the development of a renewable energy infrastructure. Urea electrolysis (UE) can be used to produce hydrogen much more cost-effectively than water electrolysis, as it theoretically requires 93% less energy. Urea can also be used as fuel in direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs), instead of H-2, and thus serve as an efficient hydrogen carrier. This review addresses the UOR in neutral, acidic, and alkaline electrolytes, with special emphasis on the latter. Recent developments in Ni-based catalysts for urea oxidation (UO) in alkaline electrolytes are discussed in detail, highlighting proposed reaction mechanisms and intermediates, based on experimental and computational results. Various catalytic designs used to mitigate the UO kinetic barriers, including the use of transition metal oxides and alloys, as well as tailored surface support materials, and discuss their application in UE and DUFCs are presented. The significant challenges impeding advances in urea electrocatalysis, in addition to emerging research areas in this field, are also discussed.

The core-shelled heterostructure consists of sulfur vacancy (Vs) in the crystalline core and oxygen vacancy (Vo) in the amorphous shell. The Vs enhances the charge transfer, and the Vo contributes to the mass transfer. The unique heterostructure requires only 1.37 and 1.38 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at 100 and 180 mA cm-2, respectively, and exhibits outstanding cycle stability without potential decay after 12,000 cycles. The structural stability is also contributed by the in situ formation of Cu2O and CuO which was investigated via in situ Raman. The defect-rich (NiFeCu)3S2@(NiFeCu)O core-shelled heterostructure also shows excellent bifunctionality with an electrolyzer cell voltage of 1.47 V at 10 mA cm-2 and 180 h stability.

Whereas, the anodic half reaction of electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in these systems awfully limited their practical application due to the complex 6 electron transfer process. Herein, vanadium doped nickel (V-Ni(OH)(2)) with highly efficient electrocatalytic activity toward UOR was developed by a simple coprecipitation method. The introducing of V not only promotes the phase transforming from inactive beta-Ni(OH)(2) to highly active alpha-Ni(OH)(2), but also simultaneously modulates the electron environment of Ni, facilitating high valence species Ni3+ generation in low overpotential, enhancing the electrocatalytic activity potent of each Ni3+ site and speeding up the electrocatalytic reaction. The optimal V-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst exhibits a summit current density of 241 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs. RHE, a Tafel slope of 32.15 mV dec(-1), outperforming beta-Ni(OH)(2) and most catalysts that tested on glassy carbon electrode. Furthermore, the assembled direct urea hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (DUPFC) offers a maximum power density of 13.4 mW cm(-2) at 20 ?.

In this work, NiSe2/TiN@Ni12P5/NF catalysts with a stalactite structure were prepared by chemical vapor deposition to obtain the integrated electrode Ni12P5/NF on the nickel foam (NF), and subsequently NiSe2/TiN was formed on the Ni12P5/NF surface by the hydrothermal method. The designed catalyst delivers an ultra-low potential of 1.270 Vat 10 mA cm-2, and a Tafel slope of 33.3 mV dec-1 for UOR. Furthermore, the catalyst only shows a 1.7% decrease in potential after an 80-h stability test, which demonstrates its excellent stability. The prepared NiSe2/TiN@Ni12P5/ NF shows a high specific surface area, and the strengthening effect between TiN and NiSe2, endowing the catalyst a high activity and durability.

Enhanced electrocatalytic activity of NiO nanoparticles supported on graphite planes towards urea electro-oxidation in NaOH solution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Nickel oxide nanoparticles are fabricated onto graphite planes [NiO/Gt] by chemical precipitation of Ni(OH)(2) particles with consecutive calcination at 400 degrees C. The formed electrocatalysts are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images demonstrate the deposition of NiO nanoparticles on graphite surface through their crystallite lattice fringes with spacing values of 2.45 angstrom (111), 2.10 angstrom (200) and 1.48 angstrom (220). The electrocatalytic activity of NiO/Gt electrocatalyst is examined towards urea electro-oxidation in NaOH solution using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Urea oxidation peak current density is observed at NiO/Gt electrocatalyst containing 15 wt% NiO [NiO/Gt-15] at a potential value of +640 mV (Ag/AgC1) with a current density value of 17.63 mA cm(-2). The loading amount of NiO in the prepared electrocatalyst significantly affects its electrocatalytic performance. NiO/Gt-15 exhibits the highest urea oxidation current density with the desired stability. The lower Tafel slope, charge transfer resistance and the higher exchange current density and diffusion coefficient values of urea molecules at NiO/Gt-15 surface elect its application as a promising electrocatalyst material during urea oxidation reaction in fuel cells.

Herein, we report a novel and effective electrocatalyst consisting of carbon cloth supported nitrogen vacancies-enriched Ce-doped Ni3N hierarchical nanosheets (Ce-Ni3N@CC) to optimize the flat-footed UOR kinetics, especially the stiff rate-determine CO2 desorption step of UOR. Upon the introduction of valance state variable Ce, the resultant nitrogen vacancies enriched Ce-Ni3N@CC exhibits an enhanced UOR performance where the operation voltage requires only 1.31 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of Ni3N@CC catalyst (1.36 V) and other counterparts. Density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the incorporation of Ce in Ni3N lowers the formation energy of nitrogen vacancies, resulting in rich nitrogen vacancies in Ce-Ni3N@CC. Moreover, the nitrogen vacancies together with Ce doping optimize the local charge distribution around Ni sites, and balance the adsorption energy of CO2 in the rate-determining step (RDS), as well as affect the initial adsorption structure of urea, leading to the superior UOR catalytic performance of Ce-Ni3N@CC. When integrating the Ce-Ni3N catalyst in UOR//HER and UOR//CO2R flow electrolyzer, both of them perform well with low operation voltage and robust long-term stability, proofing that the thermodynamically favorable UOR can act as a suitable substitute anodic reaction compared with that of OER. Our findings here not only provide a novel UOR catalyst but also offer a promising design strategy for the future development of energy-related devices.

Herein, the 3D FeOOH@Co3O4 heterostructure was constructed using FeOOH layer (10-20 nm) coated on the surface of Co(3)O(4 )nanoneedles through the strong hydrolysis of Fe3+. The FeOOH@Co3O4 heterostructure not only retains the nanoneedle structure with open frameworks, but also improves the specific surface area and expedites the charge transfer.

The anodic oxidation of urea by electromediation of Ni-(III)/Ni-(II) system in alkaline media is a promising alternative: the nitrogenous pollution is decreased while producing hydrogen at the cathode. Firstly, this study aims to deeply investigate the phenomena occurring at the interface, between electrode and electrolyte, in particular by proposing an original methodology enabling to separately study both steps,i.e. the Ni-(II) electro-oxidation and the subsequent indirect heterogeneous urea oxidation. Indeed, the variation the potential scan rate, enables (i) to study the effect of the operating parameters (concentration, temperature, angular velocity of a rotating disk electrode) on the rate of each mechanism step, and to (ii) determine key parameters of the overall process (activation energy, diffusion coefficient, anodic charge transfer coefficient and heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant). In a second time, results of urea electrolysis exhibiting high (similar to 80%) urea conversions, carried out at laboratory scale (1.4 g of urea) are discussed. The effect of some operating parameters (alkalinity, temperature, presence of an anionic separator or not) is examined, thanks to a set of analytical methods developed to establish complete mass balances of the products on the liquid phase. Cyanate, ammonium, carbonate and nitrite ions are identified to represent more than 80 % of the destroyed urea. Their respective quantities appear to be dependent of the operating conditions. This study constitutes an essential preliminary step before designing urea electrochemical process operating at larger scale.

Unfortunately, the majority of reported studies focus on empirical exploration and seldom elucidate the modulation principle of interface engineering on the electronic structure for optimizing the catalytic UOR activity, hindering the rational construction of high-performance catalysts. In response, the Ni5P4/NiSe nanoplates with abundant interfaces are experimentally fabricated on the macroporous Ni foam substrate. The density functional theory (DFT) predictions decipher accelerated charge transmission at the Ni5P4/NiSe interfacial area, accompanied by the formation of a moderate d-band center. Subsequently, the dehydrogenation dynamics of the Ni5P4/NiSe heterojunction is effectively improved during the stepwise UOR process. As expected, the elaborate Ni5P4/NiSe exhibits outstanding UOR activity under tough environments (6.0 M KOH with urine or 0.5 M urea), further corroborating its prospects as excellent UOR catalysts for industrial applications.

However, the sluggish dynamics derived from the multi-electron pathways necessitate the exploration for efficient catalysts. Herein, a p-n junction nanorod array composed of Mo doped NiP nanorod and ultrathin NiFe LDH nanosheets (NiMoP/NiFe LDH) is proposed to regulate charge distribution of interface for triggering decomposition of water and urea. The p-n junction with a powerful built-in potential (EBI) E BI ) of 1.2 V at the interface facilitates the adsorption and fracture of chemical group in water and urea molecules. Consequently, the heterostructured electrode demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance with ultralow potentials of 1.43 and 1.33 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm- 2 for OER and UOR, respectively. The overall urea electrolysis driven by NiMoP/NiFe LDH needs only 1.51 V to deliver 100 mA cm-- 2 .

However, achieving simultaneous generation of urea and oxalic acid in a continuous-flow electrolyzer is a challenge. Herein, we report a continuous-flow electrolyzer equipped with 9-square centimeter-effective area gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) which can simultaneously catalyze the glycerol oxidation reaction in the anode region and the reduction reaction of CO2 and nitrate in the cathode region, producing oxalic acid and urea at both the anode and cathode, respectively. The current density at low cell voltage (0.9 V) remained above 18.7 mA cm-2 for 10 consecutive electrolysis cycles (120 h in total), and the Faraday efficiency of oxalic acid (67.1%) and urea (70.9%) did not decay. Experimental and theoretical studies show that in terms of the formation of C-N bond at the cathode, Pd-sites can provide protons for the hydrogenation process of CO2 and NO3-, Cu-sites can promote the generation of *COOH and Bi-sites can stabilize *COOH. In addition, in terms of glycerol oxidation, the introduction of Cu and Bi into Pd metallene promotes the oxidation of hydroxyl groups and the cleavage of C-C bond in glycerol molecules, respectively.

Compared with above, urea electrolysis can improve energy conversion efficiency by introducing urea, and can also be used for purification of waste-water rich in urea. In this paper, a bifunctional electrocatalyst with heterostructure, namely Fe7Se8@Fe2O3 nanosheets supported on nickel foam, were synthesized for the first time through typical hydrothermal and partial oxidation processes. Iron cation promotes electron transfer and adjusts electron structure under the synergistic action of selenium and oxygen anion, thus achieving excellent catalytic activity of urea electrolysis. In an alkaline solution of 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, the Fe7Se8@Fe2O3/NF catalyst can drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with requiring only potential of 1.313 V and overpotential of 141 mV for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. What is noteworthy is that Fe7Se8@Fe2O3/NF heterostructure is used as bifunctional electrocatalyst to form urea electrolyzer device, which only needs potential of 1.55 V to drive current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far, and the electrode couple showed remarkable stability for 15 h. Density functional theory shows that the Fe7Se8@Fe2O3/NF material exhibits the minimum Gibbs free energy for the adsorption of hydrogen.

As a core step of UOR, proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) determines the overall performance, and accelerating its kinetic remains a challenge. In this work, a newly raised electrocatalyst of NiCoMoCuOxHy with derived multi-metal co-doping (oxy)hydroxide species during electrochemical oxidation states is reported, which ensures considerable alkaline UOR activity (10/500 mA cm(-2) at 1.32/1.52 V vs RHE, respectively). Impressively, comprehensive studies elucidate the correlation between the electrode-electrolyte interfacial microenvironment and the electrocatalytic urea oxidation behavior. Specifically, NiCoMoCuOxHy featured with dendritic nanostructure creates a strengthened electric field distribution.

To improve the surface roughness of anode surface, the electrode was firstly subjected to anodic leaching in a simple KSCN solution. The as-leached electrode was subsequently activated through linear sweep voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution with or without 0.33 M urea addition to finish the final step for electrode preparation. The as-prepared anode delivers the 10 mA cm-2 current density at an overpotential of 284 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and at 1.361 V (RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. No apparent change of OER and UOR performance was observed after chronopotentiometric aging.

In this work, a simple and scalable method synthesizes a structurally unique Ni3N nanoarray on Ni foam, Ni3N-350/NF, that provides efficient electrocatalysis for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) that transports 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.34 V. In addition, Ni3N-350/NF exhibits electro-defense electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, which provides a low overpotential of 128 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). As proof of concept, all-water-urea electrolysis measurement is carried out in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M Urea with Ni-3 N-350/NF as cathode and anode respectively. Ni3N-350/NF parallel to Ni3N-350/NF electrode can provide 100 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of only 1.51 V, 160 mV less than that of water electrolysis, which proves its commercial viability in energy-saving hydrogen production.

Unfortunately, the slow kinetic of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the surface of the anode has prevented the highly efficient production of hydrogen. One of the useful procedures to overcome this challenge is to replace the OER process by Urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Here, Co-Mn-P nanolayer was created on the surface of CoO nanosheets by electrodeposition process and its morphology, chemical composition and electrocatalytic properties were investigated in HER and UOR processes. In optimal conditions, this electrode needed only -82 mV and 1.342 V vs RHE, for HER and UOR processes at a current density of 10 mA cm- 2 respectively. In addition, this electrode demonstrated a unique activity in the two-electrode urea electrolytic cell. Significantly, a low cell voltage of 1.444 V was required at a current density of 10 mA cm- 2 in the urea electrolysis cell. Moreover, the studied electrode showed excellent stability in the HER and overall urea electrolysis systems.

Ni-based compounds are regarded as the most efficient electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Plenty of previous works are devoted to facilitating the reconstruction process, from which the active sites are generated, but a very significant issue is ignored, i.e. the reason why the activities of Ni-based compounds (e.g., phosphides, borides) far surpass the typical Ni(OH)(2) although both are finally reconstructed to Ni (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH). Here we construct a Ni2B catalyst in contrast to Ni(OH)(2). During the surface reconstruction, the B leaching results in the dissolution of B related anions (BO2) into the electrolyte and the residual B could be doped into the surface NiOOH, which is experimentally imitated by adding the BO2 into the electrolyte during the electrochemical anodic process of Ni(OH)(2) and is confirmed to be beneficial. Theoretical calculations further suggest not only the surface B doping but also the inner B species are conductive to reduce the thermodynamic barrier for the rate-limiting step (RDS) of UOR. Our findings offer deep understanding of the roles of nonmetal element for the reconstructed catalyst in the application of efficient UOR.					liang, junhui/N-6821-2019; Qin, Laishun/AGT-8974-2022; Chen, Huayu/GWQ-3485-2022; Yu, Dandan/T-6641-2019	Yin, Hang/0000-0002-5479-7698													1385-8947	1873-3212				DEC 1	2023	477								146885	10.1016/j.cej.2023.146885	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2023.146885		OCT 2023											WOS:001108352200001

Moreover, utilizing transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is an effective energy-saving hydrogen production method. A heterostructure NiSx/MoO2 catalyst was prepared by a simple method, which exhibits excellent activity for UOR, requiring only 1.4 V to reach 100 mA cm-2. The high performance is attributed to the presence of the heterostructure, which effectively promotes charge redistribution and optimizes the electronic structure of the catalyst, thereby enhancing its adsorption capacity for intermediates. As a result, an electrolyzer assembled with NiSx/MoO2 as a bifunctional catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic activity, ensures stability for over 200 ha current density of 10 mA cm- 2 , and achieves a hydrogen production rate of 0.402 mmol h-1 at a potential of 1.8 V.

The UOR process has been proved to be a two-step process which involves an electrochemical pre-oxidation reaction of the metal sites and a subsequent chemical oxidation of the urea molecules on the as-formed high-valence metal sites. Hence, designing advanced (pre-)catalysts with a boosted pre-oxidation reaction is of great importance in improving the UOR performance and thus accelerating the coupled reactions. In this feature article, we discuss the significant role of the pre-oxidation process during the urea electro-oxidation reaction, and summarize detailed strategies and recent advances in promoting the pre-oxidation reaction, including the modulation of the crystallinity, active phase engineering, defect engineering, elemental incorporation and constructing hierarchical nanostructures. We anticipate that this feature article will offer helpful guidance for the design and optimization of advanced (pre-)catalysts for UOR and related energy conversion applications.					sun, wenbin/V-1001-2019; Lei, Fengcai/D-2543-2012; Xie, Junfeng/A-9215-2010	Xie, Junfeng/0000-0002-5775-3084; Lei, Fengcai/0000-0002-6207-7164													1359-7345	1364-548X				FEB 17	2022	58	15					2430	2442		10.1039/d1cc06290e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cc06290e		JAN 2022						35084411					WOS:000750444200001

In this study, a novel CoCr2O4/GO hybrid is successfully constructed by anchoring CoCr2O4 nanoparticles on graphene oxide (GO) carrier through strong coupling, which shows superior catalytic performance as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The support of spatial GO effectively restrains the aggregation of CoCr2O4 nanoparticles, thus exposing more active areas and ensuring a steady structure. The rich oxygen defects in CoCr2O4 can serve as powerful reactive sites to accelerate the reaction kinetics. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of OER is only 274 mV, and the potential of UOR is as low as 1.35 V. Moreover, the prepared CoCr2O4/GO hybrid catalyst exhibits superb durability and stability in both OER and UOR during a test of up to 50 h. This work provides an intriguing and effective strategy for exploring efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.

J	Wu, N; Du, XQ				Wu, Na; Du, Xiaoqiang			Phase transition in V-doped cobalt hydroxide for efficient oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reaction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												In this work, many kinds of V doped Co(OH)(2) electrodes were in situ synthesized on Ni foam by a one-step typical hydrothermal process. It is worth noting that the phase transition composition of the V doped Co(OH)(2) material can be modulated by the difference of the amount of the V introduced. Different crystal phase compositions show different water oxidation activities. It is worth noting that the V2-Co(OH)(2)/NF electrode shows better oxygen evolution performance (Overpotential of 320 mV@50 mA cm(-2)) compared with Co(OH)(2)/NF (450 mV@50 mA cm(-2)), V1-Co(OH)(2)/NF (340 mV@50 mA cm(-2)) and V3-Co(OH)(2)/NF (350 mV@50 mA cm(-2)) electrodes. The experimental results show that not all doping can improve the electrochemistry performance of electrodes, such as the oxidation of urea. Density functional theory calculation further proves that the doping of the V is favorable to the adsorption of water and inhibits the adsorption of urea.

Insights into electrochemical behavior and kinetics of NiP on PEDOT:PSS/reduced graphene oxide as high-performance electrodes for alkaline urea oxidation	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY												Highly efficient, abundant, and low-cost materials are highly demanded for energy conversion applications to address the rising consumption of energy. In this study, polythiophene/reduced graphene (PT/rGO) and PEDOT:PSS/rGO (both Clevios PH1000 and Clevios P Al PH4083) as an efficient and low-cost support material were synthesized via a one-pot two-step in situ chemical polymerization method to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of NiP towards urea oxidation in alkaline media. These materials were characterized using SEM, FTIR, XRD, UV-Vis, and TGA devices. The physical characterization reveals nanospherical NiP with multifaceted phases dispersed on PT/rGO and PEDOT:PSS/rGO. The electrochemical activities of as-synthesized catalyst materials towards urea electrooxidation were tested by using cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical activity test exhibits the significant performance improvement of NiP when supported on PT/rGO and both grades of PEDOT:PSS incorporated rGO materials. Among the support materials, the highest performance enhancement with a high current density of 91.2 mAcm(-2) and lower onset potential of 0.26 V, high electrochemically active surface area, high kinetics, and high stability towards alkaline urea electrooxidation was achieved when NiP dispersed on the surface of PEDOT:PSS/rGO (PH4083). Thus, a new PEDOT:PSS/rGO (PH4083) supported NiP (NiP@PEDOT:PSS/rGO) remarkably outperformed commercial NiP, making it to be a promising anode electrocatalyst material for alkaline urea electrooxidation in direct urea fuel cell (DUFC).

In this work, a series of M-doped Co3O4 materials with foreign ions (M = Ce, Ni and Fe) were grown on a Ni foam substrate through classical hydrothermal and calcination methods. It is worth noting that not all doping of foreign ions can promote the electrocatalytic perfor-mance of intrinsic materials. The Ce-doped Co3O4 material shows excellent oxidation properties of water (overpotential of 320 mV at 50 mA cm -2) and urea (potential of 1.39 V at 50 mA cm -2). However, the doping of Ni reduces the water oxidation performance of the intrinsic material (overpotential of 410 mV@ 50 mA cm -2), and the doping of Fe reduces the urea oxidation performance of the inherent material (potential of 1.45 V@ 50 mA cm -2). A series of experimental results indicate that the improved activity of the Ce-Co3O4 electrode is attributed to faster electron transport capacity, higher exposure to active sites, and improved conductivity due to doping of Ce. It is noteworthy that the doping of these ions does alter the rate-determination step for the water oxidation reaction. The stability test demonstrated that the current density of water oxidation and urea oxidation of the catalyst had no significant attenu-ation after a long electrocatalytic activity test. This work provides a new idea for improving the electro-catalytic activity of catalysts by a doping strategy.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Despite its potential, phase engineering remains particularly challenging in thermodynamically stable perovskites, especially in a 2D structure constraint. Herein, we report phase engineering in 2D LaNiO3 perovskite using the strongly non-equilibrium microwave shock method. This approach enables the synthesis of conventional hexagonal and unconventional trigonal and cubic phases in LaNiO3 by inducing selective phase transitions at designed temperatures, followed by rapid quenching to allow precise phase control while preserving the 2D porous structure. These phase transitions induce structural distortions in the [LaO](+) layers and the hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p states, modifying local charge distribution and enhancing electron transport during the six-electron urea oxidation process (UOR). The cubic LaNiO3 offers optimal electron transport and active site accessibility due to its high structural symmetry and open interlayer spacing, resulting in a low onset potential of 1.27V and a Tafel slope of 33.1mVdec(-1) for UOR, outperforming most current catalysts. Our strategy features high designability in phase engineering, enabling various electrocatalysts to harness the power of unconventional phases.

Consequently, an electrode containing nickel oxide (NiO) nanostructures modified on glassy carbon was developed for use in nonenzymatic urea oxidation. NiO nanostructures were prepared using rice straw extract in addition to conventional chemical methods. An analysis of NiO nanostructures was carried out using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-visible spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). A variety of electrochemical measurements were performed on NiO samples prepared in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution, including cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was confirmed that these NiO samples possessed excellent redox properties. As compared to catalytic reactions for the urea oxidation reaction, electrochemically mediated Ni(III) species have demonstrated superior performance on the modified electrode surface. A number of characteristics have been reported for the NiO modified electrode. These characteristics include excellent stability, fast response times, a low detection limit of 0.004 mM, a wide linear range of 0.1 mM-19 mM in urea concentration, good selectivity, decent reproducibility, and promising performance in real-world situations. NiO modified electrodes exhibit enhanced activity due to rapid charge transfer, enriched surface active sites, large surface areas, and high electrode compatibility. The findings suggest that rice straw extract could be used as an alternative raw material for the fabrication of next-generation electrodes.

J	Saha, S; Das, GM				Saha, Sanjit; Das, Gour Mohan			Interfacial Coupling of Graphene with Nickel Nanoparticles for Water Splitting and Urea Oxidation: A Spectroelectrochemical Investigation	CHEMPHYSCHEM												Nickel nanoparticle and graphene interfaces of various stoichiometries were created through electrodeposition techniques. The catalytic behavior of the electrodeposited films was investigated through spectro-electrochemical methodologies. UV-vis absorbance spectra of the electrodeposited films are significantly different in the air and alkaline medium. Furthermore, UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the coupling of Ni nanoparticles (Ni-NP) with the graphene framework, along with NiO and Ni(OH)(2). A combination of Raman and impedance spectroscopy revealed that the surface adsorption and charge transfer properties of the electrodeposited films are entirely dependent on the defects on graphene structure as well as distribution of Ni-NP on graphene. The electrodeposited films possess heterogeneous catalytic properties with a low overpotential of 50 mV (10 mA/cm(-2)) for hydrogen evolution reaction, as well as 601 mV and 391 mV (at 50 mA/cm(-2)) for the oxygen evolution reaction and urea oxidation reaction, respectively. In addition, eelectrodeposited samples show extraordinary overall water splitting performance by achieving a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a very low applied potential of 1.38 V. This synergistic coupling of Ni and graphene renders the electrodeposited samples promising candidates as electrodes for overall water splitting in alkaline and urea-supplemented solutions.

Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activities by Substitutional Tuning of Nickel-Based Ruddlesden-Popper Catalysts for the Oxidation of Urea and Small Alcohols	ACS CATALYSIS												The electrooxidation of urea continues to attract considerable interest as an alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as the anodic reaction in the electrochemical generation of hydrogen due to the lower potential required to drive the reaction and the abundance of urea available in waste streams. Herein, we investigate the effect of Sr-substitution in a series of La2-xSrxNiO4+delta Ruddlesden-Popper catalysts on the electrooxidations of urea, methanol, and ethanol and conclude that activities toward the urea oxidation reaction increase with increasing Ni oxidation state. The 75% Sr-substituted La0.5Sr1.5NiO4+delta catalyst exhibits a mass activity of 588 mA mg(ox)(-1) and 7.85 A mg(-1) cm(ox)(-2) for the electrooxidation of urea in 1 M KOH containing 0.33 M urea, demonstrating the potential applications of Ni-based Ruddlesden-Popper materials for direct urea fuel cells and low-cost hydrogen production. Additionally, we find the same correlations between Ni oxidation state and activities for the electrooxidations of methanol and ethanol, as well as identify processes that result in catalyst deactivation for all three oxidations. This demonstration of how systematically increasing Ni - O bond covalency by raising the formal oxidation state of Ni above +3 serves to increase catalyst activity for these reactions will act as a governing principle for the rational design of catalysts for the electrooxidation of urea and other small molecules going forward.

In this study, a nanostructured, porous and active Ni-Cu-Mn-P electrode was created using the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) process in different conditions. The fabricated electrodes were utilized as bi-functional electrodes for both the HER and UOR processes. The electrochemical results displayed that the Ni-Cu-Mn-P (which synthesized at current density of 2 A.cm(-2)) requires only 84 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), in HER process, and the necessary potential value for the UOR is only 1.30 V vs RHE. Also, the favorable electrocatalytic stability for industrial applications was also confirmed. The Ni-Cu-Mn-P electrode also demonstrated satisfactory performance in the overall urea electrolysis process and the cell voltage was 1.40 V to generate 10 mA.cm(-2). The excellent performance of the electrode was due to the hierarchical porous nanostructure with high active surface area and also the synergistic effect between the elements.

However, it still remains some challenges originating from the intrinsically sluggish UOR dynamics and the high energy barrier for urea adsorption. In response, we report the coupled NiSe2 nanowrinkles with Ni5P4 nanorods heterogeneous structure onto Ni foam (denoted as NiSe2@Ni5P4/NF) through successive phosphorization and selenization strategy, in which the produced closely contacted interface could provide high-flux electron transfer pathways. Theoretical findings decipher that the fast charge transfer takes place at the interfacial region from Ni5P4 to NiSe2, which is conducive to optimizing adsorption energy of urea molecules. As expected, the well-designed NiSe2@Ni5P4/NF only requires the low potential of 1.402 V at the current density of 500 mAmiddotcm(-2). More importantly, a small Tafel slope of 27.6 mVmiddotdec(-1), a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1.037 s(-1) as well as the prolonged stability of 950 h at the current density of 100 mAmiddotcm(-2) are also achieved.

Prepared material has shown ipA of 5.88 mA cm-2 at 514 mV during CV scan and 10 mA cm-2 at 693 mV during LSV in 0.15 M urea in 1 M KOH solution. The reaction mechanism was examined during bulk electrolysis with the periodic sampling and reaction products analysis. We found that the reaction efficiency was higher for our catalyst, with lower clamping voltages with respect to pure nickel. However, analysis with IC has shown that UOR using a NiCuGO electrode has led to a higher content of NO2- ions. The presence of this type of by-product in wastewater is a major environmental threat, which is why further research is needed for catalyst optimisation. It also shows that the widely agreed mechanism of UOR with Ni-based catalysts leading to N2, CO2, and H2O is not accurate in some cases and how crucial product analysis is for the catalyst evaluation.

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction for energy-saving hydrogen generation. In this study, by tuning the lattice expansion, a series of M-FeNi layered double hydroxides (M-FeNi LDHs, M: Mo, Mn, V) with excellent UOR performance are synthesized. The hydrolytic transformation of Fe-MIL-88A is assisted by urea, Ni2+ and high-valence metals, to form a hollow M-FeNi LDH. Owing to the large atomic radius of the high-valence metal, lattice expansion is induced, and the electronic structure of the FeNi-LDH is regulated. Doping with high-valence metal is more favorable for the formation of the high-valence active species, NiOOH, for the UOR. Moreover, the hollow spindle structure promoted mass transport. Thus, the optimal Mo-FeNi LDH showed outstanding UOR electrocatalytic activity, with 1.32 V at 10 mA cm-2. Remarkably, the Pt/C||Mo-FeNi LDH catalyst required a cell voltage of 1.38 V at 10 mA & BULL;cm-2 in urea-assisted water electrolysis. This study suggests a new direction for constructing nanostructures and modulating electronic structures, which is expected to ultimately lead to the development of a class of auxiliary electrocatalysts. The spindle-like hollow M-FeNi layered double hydroxides (M = Mo, V, and Mn) doping with high-valence metal are prepared. Owing to the large atomic radius of the high-valence metal, lattice expansion is induced, and the electronic structure of the FeNi-LDH is regulated. Moreover, the hollow structure promotes mass transport. Thus, the optimal Mo-FeNi LDH shows excellent electrocatalytic performance in urea-assisted alkaline media.image					Zhai, Quan-Guo/D-9317-2011; Huo, Jiamin/ABC-9226-2021; Chen, Yu/B-7473-2013; Yuan, Wenyu/AAO-8120-2021	Chen, Yu/0000-0001-9545-6761; Zhai, Quan-Guo/0000-0003-1117-4017													1613-6810	1613-6829				JAN	2024	20	4								10.1002/smll.202305877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202305877		SEP 2023						37718437					WOS:001066200100001

In this work, by merging bimetallic Co-Mo oxides with metallic Co on the graphite felt (GF), we effectively manufacture a 3D bifunctional and highly efficient electrocatalyst (CoMoO@Co/GF) with multi-site functionality for the simultaneous reduction of water and the oxidation of urea in an alkaline medium. The presence of metallic Co causes Co-Mo oxides to evolve from amorphous to crystalline structures. The coupling interface produced between metallic Co and Co-Mo oxides is proven to facilitate electron transport in addition to extensively accessible and highly electroactive Co-Mo oxide nanoflower architecture. The experimental results reveal that the over-potentials for OER and UOR in the CoMoO@Co/GF electrode require only 269 and 115 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, with the aid of urea, the over-potential for HER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is lowered to 155 mV. Most notably, the constructed CoMoO@Co/GF-based electrolytic cell only requires a 1.5 V dry battery to achieve effective H-2 evolution and noteworthy stability, outperforming the commercial catalyst-based device and many previous results. The combination of experiments and theoretical calculations further clarifies the active sites in the catalyst. What's more, the pathway of electron transfer in the catalytic process is defined.

Herein, we synthesize a V2O3 nanosheet anchored N-doped-carbon encapsulated Ni heterostructure (Ni@C-V2O3/NF) for the reactions of urea oxidation (UOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER). Electrochemical results indicate that it exhibits small potentials of 1.32, 1.39, and 1.43 V for UOR and low overpotentials of 36, 254, and 355 mV for HER at +/- 10, +/- 500 and +/- 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively. It can work at 100 mA cm(-2) for over 72 h as cathode and anode electrode without obvious attenuation, suggesting an outstanding durability. The reason for this behavior could be ascribed to the N-doped-carbon coating structure, the synergetic effects between Ni and V2O3, and the nano/micro nanosheets architecture self-supported on nickel foam.

However, untreated urea or urine wastewater causes severe environmental pollution and threatens human health. Electrocatalytic and photo(electro)catalytic urea oxidation technologies under mild conditions have become promising methods for energy recovery and environmental remediation. An in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanisms of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is important to design efficient electrocatalysts/photo(electro)catalysts for these technologies. This review provides a critical appraisal of the recent advances in the UOR by means of both electrocatalysis and photo(electro)catalysis, aiming to comprehensively assess this emerging field from fundamentals and materials, to practical applications. The emphasis of this review is on the design and development strategies for electrocatalysts/photo(electro)catalysts based on reaction pathways. Meanwhile, the UOR in natural urine is discussed, focusing on the influence of impurity ions. A particular emphasis is placed on the application of the UOR in energy and environmental fields, such as hydrogen production by urea electrolysis, urea fuel cells, and urea/urine wastewater remediation. Finally, future directions, prospects, and remaining challenges are discussed for this emerging research field.

Herein a novel interfacial coordination assembly protocol is established to modify the Co-phytate coordination complex on the Ni-based metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheet array (CC/Ni-BDC@Co-PA) toward boosted and sustained UOR electrocatalysis. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations unveil that surface Co-PA modification over Ni-BDC can manipulate the electronic state of Ni sites, and in situ evolved charge-redistributed surface can promote urea adsorption and the subsequent CN bond cleavage. Impressively, Co-PA functionalization can impart a negatively charged catalyst surface with improved aerophobicity, not only weakening *COO adsorption and promoting CO2 departure, but also repelling CO32- approaching to deactivate Ni species, eventually alleviating CO2 poisoning and enhancing operational durability. Beyond that, improved hydrophilic and aerophobic characteristics would also contribute to better mass transfer kinetics. Consequently, CC/Ni-BDC@Co-PA exhibits prominent UOR performance with an ultralow potential of 1.300 V versus RHE to attain 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1), and strong durability, comparable to the best Ni-based electrocatalysts documented thus far.

J	Park, S; Lee, JT; Kim, J				Park, Soona; Lee, Jeong Tae; Kim, Jungwon			Photocatalytic oxidation of urea on TiO2 in water and urine: mechanism, product distribution, and effect of surface platinization	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The photocatalytic oxidation of urea on TiO2 in water was compared with that in urine. Despite the presence of other organic compounds in urine, the oxidation efficiency of urea on TiO2 in urine was higher than that in water. This enhanced oxidation of urea in urine is ascribed to the higher production of (OH)-O-center dot (primary oxidant for urea degradation) by the adsorption of PO43- (one constituent of urine) on the TiO2 surface. Among the various anions in urine, only PO43- was adsorbed on the surface of TiO2. Both the production of (OH)-O-center dot and the oxidation of urea were enhanced in the presence of PO43-. These results indicate that the enhanced (OH)-O-center dot production by in situ surface phosphorylation is the reason for the increased oxidation of urea in urine. Surface platinization of TiO2 enhanced the oxidation of urea in water. However, the oxidation efficiency of urea on Pt/TiO2 in urine was lower than that in water. This behavior is due to the adsorption of PO43- and SO42- in urine on Pt deposits, which inhibits the adsorption of oxygen and the interfacial electron transfer to oxygen. The product distribution (i.e., the molar ratio of NO3- to NH4+) in water was different from that in urine because the negatively charged surface of TiO2 in urine attracts the positively charged area of carbamic acid (intermediate) and encourages its decomposition into NH4+ and not into NO3-.

J	Shekhawat, A; Samanta, R; Panigrahy, S; Barman, S				Shekhawat, Anirudha; Samanta, Rajib; Panigrahy, Sonali; Barman, Sudip			Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Urea and Ethanol on Two-Dimensional Amorphous Nickel Oxide Encapsulated on N-Doped Carbon Nanosheets	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS												Hydrogen production from water electrolysis is of great interest for attaining sustainable clean energy storage and conversion, but the required working voltage (>1.23 V) in water splitting limits its applications in industrial expansion. Therefore, replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a more favorable anodic oxidation reaction, which can provide more valuable products and less working voltage, will be of great significance for the upcoming expansion of hydrogen production in industrial applications. In this report, a two-dimensional (2D) amorphous sheet-like nickel oxide encapsulated on the nitrogen doped carbon (NiOx/CNx) composite was synthesized for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Remarkably, the catalyst shows 1.647, 1.378, and 1.354 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential at 10 mA/cm2 current density for OER, UOR, and EOR, respectively, with good stability. The overall water, urea, and ethanol electrolyses of NiOx/CNx were carried out by coupling with commercial Pt/C as a cathode which shows only 1.626, 1.43, and 1.414 V cell potential at 20 mA/cm2 current density. The catalyst also shows excellent chronopotentiometric and dynamic stability toward all the electrolyses. The high catalytic activity of NiOx/CNx may be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the support and materials, amorphous structure, 2D sheet-like morphology, porous structure, and high electrochemical surface area. This finding shows that NiOx/CNx nanosheets can replace noble metal-based catalysts for efficient anodic oxidation reactions.

The study has dual objectives: (i) to gain a better understanding of the effects of organic compounds (other than urea) in human urine on UEO and (ii) to upscale the process to pilot-scale. Initial voltammetric studies at labscale using real human urine showed that urea adsorption on nickel(III) sites, followed by its electrooxidation, competes with molecules such as creatinine, histidine, and creatine. Notably, creatinine reduced the nickel(II) oxidation signal by up to 20 %, indicating its reaction precedence over urea. Additionally, the oxidation rate of urea by nickel(III) in urine exhibited a much lower partial order (0.1), as opposed to 0.3 in KOH solution, confirming the impact of competitive adsorption. Subsequently, UEO experiments were upscaled using a specially designed 1 L undivided tubular EC reactor operating in multi-pass mode. Potentiostatic electrolysis of a urea synthetic solution was conducted over 70 h, achieving nitrogen and carbon species mass balances of over 97 %-a milestone previously unreported at this scale. The study further examined the influence of operating parameters such as anode surface area, flow rate and applied potential on the EC process. This investigation underscored the impact of factor like reactor geometry, controlled potential and temperature on process efficiency. Parameters for optimal N2 production, highest urea conversion rate, etc., were also defined. Finally, the electrolysis of human urine at pilot-scale unveiled new challenges distinct from those encountered with urea synthetic solutions.

In this study, Fe-doped Ni12P5 nanorods were prepared by depositing 1,1' -bis (diphenylphosphine) ferrocene (DPPF) on N-doped C/NF. The bottom-up growth of the nanorod is ascribed to the preferential adsorption of DPPF with a P site to NF that is surface-doped with the solid-solving C, and the length of nanorods can reach tens of microns and has good robustness. The N-doped carbon-constrained rod-shaped Fe-doped Ni12P5 catalyst (FeNi12P5/NdC/NF-800) that grows on NF has excellent catalytic performance for the urea oxidation reaction. In addition, the current density can be maintained as high as 100 mA cm-2 and the current attenuation is weak for 12 h, and the rod shape remains good.

Herein, the porous dendritic NiCu@PPy/316L stainless steel mesh (SSM) electrode is prepared by dynamic hydrogen bubble template electrodeposition, followed by cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition of polypyrrole (PPy) conductive polymer on the electrode surface. Among them, dynamic hydrogen bubbles successfully assisted the formation of porous structures in the Ni-based deposition layer. In addition, the morphology of the resulting Ni-based layer further evolves from particle stacking to dendritic with high specific surface area with Cu doping. Eventually, 2-NiCu/SSM achieves current densities of 294.5 mA center dot cm(-2) (MOR) and 278.6 mA center dot cm(-2) (UOR) at 0.8 V, respectively. The PPy coating prevents the agglomeration of NiCu particles in the catalytic layer and further improves the persistence of the electrochemical performance. After 2000 cycles, the current densities of 2-NiCu @PPy/SSM in the new electrolyte are maintained at 89.1% (MOR) and 94.8% (UOR) of the original value, with a 10% increase for MOR and a 7% increase for UOR compared to the sample without PPy coating (2-NiCu /SSM).					mei, jie/KMA-6084-2024; Zhang, Jianli/GZM-2163-2022; Zheng, Guoqu/H-3428-2011; chen, qiang/GWZ-7308-2022														0169-4332	1873-5584				JUN 30	2023	623								156930	10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.156930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.156930		MAR 2023											WOS:001024419200001

A contrastive research was also made to a commercial MnO2 catalyst. The catalytic performance of MnO2 for NH3-SCO was found to be connected with the properties of the catalysts which were obviously determined by the preparation methods. The best catalytic activity was achieved at 170 degrees C over the MnO2 synthesized by urea-assisted hydrothermal method. The properties of catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, SEM, XPS, H-2-TPR and NH3-TPD techniques. And it was found that MnO2 prepared by urea-assisted synthetic method showed larger surface area and lower reduction temperature. Abundant NH3 adsorption sites and oxygen vacancies were formed on its surface compared to the other catalysts, which evidently enhanced the catalytic performance for NH3 selective oxidation.

Additionally, urine and urea-containing wastes are being explored as fuels, sources for generating electricity and treating waste water simultaneously in urea fuel cells (UFC). Herein, we report the urea oxidation reaction detected for nitrogen (N) doped carbon nanofibers (CNFs) grown on nichrome (NiCr) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and study its various electrochemical parameters to determine its capability as urea fuel cell catalyst. Nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr) metal particles were observed inside the CNFs structure as an alloy. Ni has been reported to be the most promising catalysts among transition metal catalysts. In this study, we have explored the possibility of a bimetallic transition metal/nitrogen doped carbon supported catalyst to overcome the large overpotentials exhibited by individual Ni-based catalysts for urea oxidation. The Tafel slope was found to be 640 mV/dec with diffusion coefficient D equal to 4.312x10(-13) cm(2)/s and the anodic transfer coefficient equal to 0.472. The charge transfer impedance was also calculated at 0 V and 0.4 V (onset potential) from the Nyquist plots. Our study revealed that NiCr NCNFs (Nichrome/nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers) exhibited significant UOR in variable molar concentrations of urea in 1 M KOH, making it a suitable candidate for urea oxidation reaction.

Ni-based electrocatalysts are expected to replace precious metal catalysts for UOR because of their high activity and low cost. However, the construction of Ni-based electrocatalysts that can synergistically enhance UOR still needs further in-depth study. In this study, highly active electrocatalysts of NiFe(OH)(x)/MnO2 p-p heterostructures are constructed on nickel foam (NF) by electrodeposition (NiFe(OH)(x)/MnO2/NF), illustrating the effect of electronic structure changes at heterogeneous interfaces on UOR and revealing the catalytic mechanism of UOR. The NiFe(OH)(x)/MnO2/NF only needs 1.364 V (vs Reversible Hydrogen Electrode, RHE) to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for UOR. Structural characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that energy gap leads to directed charge transfer and redistribution at the heterojunction interface, forming electron-rich (MnO2) and electron-poor (NiFe(OH)(x)) regions. This enhances the catalyst's adsorption of urea and reaction intermediates, reduces thermodynamic barriers during the UOR process, promotes the formation of Ni3+ phases at lower potentials, and thus improves UOR performance. This work provides a new idea for the development of Ni-based high-efficiency UOR electrocatalysts.

Herein, we synthesized novel CeO2/Co(OH)(2)/FeS nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (CeO2/Co (OH)(2)/FeS@NF) through a simple two-step hydrothermal and following solvothermal routine. In this special structure, the ultra-thin 2D nanosheet morphology can adequately offer large contact area and thus abundant of active sites, facilitating significantly the mass transfer. Furthermore, the incorporation of FeS into CeO2/Co(OH)(2) will not only modify the electron structure but also provide a number of phase interfaces, which can improve the inherent electron conductivity and promote the electron transport. More importantly, the rich oxygen vacancies (Ov) sites can vary the coordination of metal centers, modulating both the charge distribution and M-O bonding strength. As results, the CeO2/Co(OH)(2)/FeS@NF shows superior low overpotentials of 178 mV/1.30 V at 10 mA cm(- 2) to OER/UOR. The activity keeps its low value of 232 mV/1.375 V even when the current density was increased to as high as 300 mA cm- 2. More importantly, the electrode of CeO2/Co(OH)(2)/FeS@NF//CeO2/Co (OH)(2)/FeS@NF just requires a low cell voltage of 1.41 V to realize OUS at a current density of 10 mA cm(- 2). Specifically, we also realized solar-driven H2 production. Plenty of H2 bubbles were continuously generated with a high speed of 600 L h(- 1) m(-2) on the working electrode surface once the solar panel was placed under the natural sunlight.					mingyue, Li/KPY-7305-2024														0360-3199	1879-3487				DEC 11	2024	94						706	715		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.11.141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.11.141		NOV 2024											WOS:001360498000001

Here, we report a facile strategy for boron-doping cobalt and cobalt-phosphide interfacial electrocatalysts (B-Co/Co2P) for bifunctional OER/UOR. By virtue of B doping, the abundant exposed active sites as well as enhanced electrical conductivity can efficiently improve charge migration of the heterogeneous interfacial sites. Therefore, the obtained B-Co/Co2P electrocatalysts exhibit bifunctional OER/UOR activities with an outstanding overpotential of 284 and 107 mV at an industrial current density of 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Such an excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the fact that the B dopant adjusts the electron distribution of interfacial catalytic sites and optimizes the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediate species, as well as reduces the energy barriers of water oxidation. Furthermore, the setup two-electrode cell requires merely overpotentials of 280.7 and 56.9 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) with robust stability in water splitting and urea electrolysis, respectively. Overall, this report provides a strategy to construct bifunctional OER/UOR catalysts with high efficiency for hydrogen generation.

The constructed LaCoO3-D43 exhibits superior catalytic activity (T-90 = 309.3 degrees C), the T-90 value is 150 degrees C lower than that of LaCoO3, and excellent thermal stability against CO2 and H2O. Experimental results revealed that the urea pyrolysis resulted in the generation of La and O defects and rich surface-active Co species in high-valence states, increasing the utilization of Co active sites. DFT calculations show that the exposed Co surface is conducive to the adsorption and dissociation of oxygen and propane.

LDHs have shown high electrochemical activity in energy conversion systems such as batteries and fuel cells. In this study, we developed a hierarchically porous nanostructure derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67, which was subsequently transformed into an LDH structure with varying Ni concentrations. We precisely controlled the Ni-to-Co ratio within the LDH structure and investigated how different mole fractions of Co and Ni influence catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR). LDH structures with low Ni content (up to 40%) demonstrated high activity and selectivity for O2 due to their structural instability and the predominant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) originating from ZIF-67. In contrast, LDHs with high Ni content (over 60%) supressed OER and exhibited enhanced activity for UOR. The resulting hollow structure with an expanded electrochemically active surface in LDHs with high Ni content could improve mass transport and diffusion at the electrode interface, leading to better reaction kinetics and higher current densities.

However, slow kinetics of urea electro-oxidation reaction and finding an optimal catalyst continues to be major challenges. In this study, we report the preparation of hierarchical Ni(OH)(2)-NiS in-plane edge hybrid nanosheets on the carbon cloth surface (Ni(OH)(2)-NiS-CC) as a flexible catalytic electrode by hydrothermal and electroplating processes. The Ni(OH)(2)-NiS-CC substrate is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electro-chemical methods. The developed hierarchical Ni(OH)(2)-NiS-CC nanosheets electrode shows an enhanced electrocatalytic performance (low-onset oxidation potential, rapid reaction kinetics, and higher mass activity) towards urea electro-oxidation than NiS-CC in an alkaline solution. Counting the benefits including superior catalytic activity, conductivity and available more active sites, the hierarchical Ni(OH)(2)-NiS-CC in-plane edge hybrid nanosheets electrode displays urea electro-oxidation with a catalytic current of 87.5 mA at 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which denotes the remarkable electrocatalytic activity as compared with other Ni based catalysts.

Water-Stable Fluorous Metal-Organic Frameworks with Open Metal Sites and Amine Groups for Efficient Urea Electrocatalytic Oxidation	SMALL												Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternative anodic reactions to water oxidation that has attracted extensive attention in green hydrogen production. The application of specifically designed electrocatalysts capable of declining energy consumption and environmental consequences is one of the major challenges in this field. Therefore, the goal is to achieve a resistant, low-cost, and environmentally friendly electrocatalyst. Herein, a water-stable fluorinated Cu(II) metalorganic framework (MOF) {[Cu-2(L)(H2O)(2)]& BULL;(5DMF)(4H(2)O)}(n) (Cu-FMOF-NH2; H4L = 3,5-bis(2,4-dicarboxylic acid)-4-(trifluoromethyl)aniline) is developed utilizing an angular tetracarboxylic acid ligand that incorporates both trifluoromethyl (-CF3) and amine (-NH2) groups. The tailored structure of Cu-FMOF-NH2 where linkers are connected by fluoride bridges and surrounded by dicopper nodes reveals a 4,24T1 topology. When employed as electrocatalyst, Cu-FMOF-NH2 requires only 1.31 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1.0 m KOH with 0.33 m urea electrolyte and delivered an even higher current density (50 mA cm(-2)) at 1.47 V versus RHE. This performance is superior to several reported catalysts including commercial RuO2 catalyst with overpotential of 1.52 V versus RHE.

Ni-based compounds have received attention as the most promising earth-abundant electrocatalysts for OER and UOR, whereas some compounds in this main group, e.g., nickel selenides and tellurides, have received little attention. Herein, we demonstrate the interfacial engineered Ni0.85Se/NiTe array on Ni foam as a highly efficient catalyst for the OER, which exhibits an overpotential of 200 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solutions. Meanwhile, it exhibits a low potential of 1.301 V for the UOR at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). In particular, it even has the potential to be used in methanol oxidation reaction and ethanol oxidation reaction. The vertical NiTe array not only serves as the conductive substrate for highly improving the mass loading of Ni0.85Se, but also triggers the strong electron interaction between two components, leading to increased adsorption sites available for the intermediates formed in the OER and UOR on the Ni0.85Se surface. This study provides a broad avenue to construct hierarchical nanostructures as outstanding electrocatalysts for efficient OER and UOR. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Hydrogen is a very clean and easy to prepare energy source. In this paper, a hybrid materials of Fe-6(OH)(12)(CO3) and sulphide (Ni9S8/Co9S8) was demonstrated as a catalytic electrode for efficient oxidation reaction in seawater and urea. The catalysts were prepared by a three-step hydrothermal-sulfuration-hydrothermal reaction, and the layered composites of hydroxides and sulfides were co-grown into nano-arrays, which exposed more reaction centers and shortened the electron transfer path. The three metal cations were also able to demonstrate different corrosion resistance and excellent adsorption properties for different environments, allowing the catalyst to present better electrochemical activity in seawater as well as in urea solution. In the oxidation reaction in urea solution (1 M KOH+0.5 +0.5 M urea), the required voltage was only 1.33 V at a current intensity of 50 mA/cm(2), and in the water oxidation reaction in seawater, the required voltage was only 1.47 V at a current intensity of 50 mA/cm(2) for Ni9S8@Co9S8@Fe6(OH)(12)(CO3). . Unfortunately, the durability of the catalyst need to be improved, the current density dropped from 40 mA/cm2 2 to 35 mA/cm(2 )and then remained for 12 h. Meanwhile, the comparison of electrochemical performance tests was performed before and after the IT test, it can be clearly seen that the overall performance of Ni9S8@Co9S8@Fe6(OH)(12)(CO3). decreased after the stability test, which may be related to the shedding of active species from the surface of the catalyst. As you can see through density functional theory (DFT) that Ni9S8 can promote the adsorption energy of urea and Co9S8 lowers the barrier to electron conduction. Many conjectures were made and confirmed in this study, and finally, it is hoped that seawater as well as industrial wastewater can be better utilized for the production of clean energy.																			0360-3199	1879-3487				NOV 4	2024	89						413	423		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.09.368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.09.368		SEP 2024											WOS:001329102200001

This study investigated urea estimation in dialysate by using an indirect urea oxidation of nickel on nitrogen doped carbon with an incorporation of surface roughness (R-f) and double layer current (I-dl). Fascinatingly, the second oxidation peak on (reverse) cathodic scan at 0.42 V vs Ag/AgCl in cyclic voltammetry and the first peak of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) after background subtraction were evidenced to the exploited NiOOH binding with urea, concurrently with the regeneration of Ni(OH)(2). In presence of more urea, the decreasing trends of the oxidation peaks in both techniques were observed and capable of determining urea concentrations in human dialysate. In consideration of actual reaction current, the measured total current after background subtraction in fresh simulated dialysate provides the sensitivity of -5.136 x 10(-5) A.mM(-1) (R-2 = 0.998) and limit of detection of 60.2 mu M in 1-5 mM linear range. For validation in patients' dialysate, the total current peak was normalized by R-f and subtracted from I-dl, resulting in excellent urea estimation with recovery percentage between 99.18 and 102.68 in comparison to that of clinical standard, offering future prognostic monitoring and wearable artificial kidney.

Electrocatalytic performance of inorganic nanoflakes nickel phosphates under adjusted synthetic parameters towards urea and methanol oxidation in alkaline media	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL												Inorganic nanoflakes nickel phosphates (Ni-P) were introduced to enhance the activity of the working electrode for the electrooxidation of small organic molecules: methanol and urea. The urea proportions during the synthesis of the Ni-P material were evaluated and its impact on Ni-P morphology and structure was determined. The as-fabricated Ni-P material was studied in terms of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Field emission scanning electron microscope/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FESEM/EDX), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analyses. These techniques indicate the synthesized material is Ni-P with nanoflakes morphology. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), as well as impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques, were investigated in the reference/working/counter electrodes system to study the electrocatalytic performance of the introduced nanoflakes phosphate material for both methanol and urea oxidation in presence of KOH aqueous medium. 0.8 M of urea was the optimum proportion found for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The synthesized phosphates showed enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol and urea at different scan rates. Besides, the EIS approves the ability of the synthesized nanoflakes phosphate to electrochemically oxidize methanol and urea. This study presents cheap electrocatalysts to help in the commercial process of fuel cells as well as water treatment from organics like urea.

Chemical deposition from a liquid crystal template: A highly active mesoporous nickel phosphate electrocatalyst for hydrogen green production via urea electro-oxidation in an alkaline solution	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Recently the urea and urinated wastewater electrolysis process has shown promising technology for hydrogen fuel green production in addition to denitrification of wastewater. How-ever, to make the process economically valuable, the electrocatalysts nanoarchitecture, nanometer size, shape, facets, and composition need to be engineered to boost the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). This work demonstrates a simple and novel approach to the synthesis of mesoporous nickel phosphate nanoparticles (meso-NiPO) via chemical deposition from a surfactant liquid crystal template. Typically, the nickel ions dissolved in the aqueous domain of the hexagonal liquid crystalline phase of the Brij (R) 78 template were chemically reacted with the sodium phosphate solution to precipitate the mesoporous nickel phosphate nanoarchitecture after washing up the surfactant. The physicochemical characterizations show the meso-NiPO exhibits an amorphous highly mesoporous structure with a higher specific surface area (43.50 m(2)/g) compared to the bare nickel phosphate (bare-NiPO, 4.26 m(2)/g) prepared in the absence of surfactant. The electrochemical performance of meso-NiPO electrocatalyst for the urea oxidation reaction in alkaline solution exhibits superior activity including a lower oxidation onset potential (0.30 V vs. Ag/AgCl), charge transfer resistance (3.35 O) and mass activity of 700.7 mA/cm2 mg at the oxidation potential of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Moreover, the meso-NiPO reveals long-term stability, and 97.5% of the steady-state oxidation cur-rent was maintained after the 3-hour urea electrolysis test. Using an H-shape urea electrolyzer, the corresponding cathodic hydrogen production rate reached 415 mmol/h and a Faradic efficiency of 96.8 % at an applied bias of 2.0 V. The electroactivity high performance of the mesoporous nickel phosphate is ascribed to the high specific surface area and mesoporous architecture that provide efficient charge transfer, as well as mass transport of the electroactive species. The chemical deposition from a surfactant liquid crystal template has the advantages of a one-pot template, applicable to the synthesis of a wide range of nanomaterials with various compositions and nanoarchitectures at room temperature for application in electrochemical energy production and storage systems.

The route also offers excellent potential for hydrogen production through wastewater remediation. Here, a simple synthetic strategy has been adopted to embed NiS in a nitrogen-rich stable and activated mesoporous carbon matrix (NOMC) that has been successfully exploited for UOR. The NOMC supported nickel sulfide catalyst with high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) exhibits a very good response towards the electro-catalytic oxidation of urea in an alkaline medium with a low working oxidation potential (potential corresponding to the current density value of 10 mA/cm2 taken as a standard) of 1.34 V (vs. RHE). The introduction of heteroatom (N) to the mesoporous carbon support and subsequent incorporation of metal sulfide rather than metal oxide or metal hydroxide, as reported previously, is done purposefully to increase the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst through the synergistic effects of charge density with carbon support. The synergism is further supported by the comparative response in urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for NiS/NOMC catalyst compared to other Ni-based catalysts like Ni(OH)2, NiS, and NiS/CMK-3, which indicates that the activity is highest for NiS/NOMC. The catalyst attains good stability in an alkaline medium. The mesoporous carbon framework (NOMC) with considerably high BET surface area, large pore volume, and interconnected ion diffusion channels accelerate the transport of electrons through the porous surface, which makes NiS/NOMC highly efficient and stable as an electrocatalyst for the oxidation of urea in comparison to its other composite catalysts in alkaline medium.

Herein, soybean meal-based adhesives were fabricated via the addition of dialdehyde cellulose (DAC) obtained from waste paper dissolved in an alkali-urea system and oxidized with sodium periodate. Due to the dissolution by the alkali-urea system, DAC dispersed well in the solution and did not aggregate in the adhesive matrix. Because of the oxidation treatment, DAC was crosslinked with the adhesive matrix via a Schiff base reaction. Meanwhile, hydrogen bonds were formed at the interface between the DAC and the adhesive matrix. Plywood with the SM/DAC/PTGE adhesive reached its highest wet bonding strength of 1.27 MPa (4 wt% DAC addition), a 95% increase compared to that with the unmodified SM/PTGE adhesive. Fine DAC-to-SM interfacial bonding and a dense crosslinking network were constructed in the SM/DAC/PTGE adhesive systems. The cycle of reuse for the alkali-urea system in the experiments demonstrated that the preparation method of the cellulose solution was scalable and sustainable.

Nickel-based catalysts can impetuate UOR but result in urea peroxidation. Seeking a balance between reaction selectivity and reaction kinetics, that is, trading off energy utilization efficiency against the energy conversion rate, is a necessary choice for designing UOR catalysts. Therefore, we designed Co, Mn codoped NiS2 trimetallic nanoparticles at the expense of partial UOR selectivity. The optimal catalyst shows a high urea electrooxidation activity of 77 mA cm(-2) at 1.5 V (vs RHE) and good stability. A series of electrochemical experiments combined with in situ electrochemical mass spectrometry and XPS unveiled the effect of each metal sites clearly. The doped Mn is beneficial to oxidizing the adjacent urea molecules, which modulate the UOR pathway and initiate urea peroxidation. Besides, the electron exchange between Co-Ni accelerates the urea oxidation of Ni and accelerates the oxidation of CO. The combination of the three improves the UOR catalytic performance of the material. Our work paves the way for the rational design and synthesis of highly efficient nanocatalysts to achieve industrial energy conversion and economic hydrogen production.																				2574-0970				OCT 2	2023	6	19					17473	17481		10.1021/acsanm.3c02579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.3c02579		OCT 2023											WOS:001080915200001

Polypyrrole@polyaniline-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite support material and Cobalt for the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of nickel phosphide microsphere towards alkaline urea oxidation	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												Efficient and low-cost materials are highly demanded to improve the sluggish kinetics and stability of direct urea fuel cells for large-scale commercialization. In this study, modification of conventional nickel phoaphide (NiP) by cobalt doping via the facile solvothermal method and simultaneously dispersing prepared cobalt nickel phosphide (CoNiP) on poly (aniline-co-pyrrole)/reduced graphene oxide (PPy@PANI/rGO) as efficient and low-cost support material via simple ultrasonic/heat mediated dispersion process. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and an x-ray diffractometer. Furthermore, Cyclic Voltammetry tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of synthesized catalysis towards alkaline urea oxidation. The physical characterization depicts the successful formation of NiP and Co-doped NiP microsphere with a particle size of 4.306 mu m and 2.04 mu m, respectively. In addition, homogeneous distribution of the CoNiP microsphere in the structure of PPy@PANI/rGO support material was achieved. Based on the CV test, the superior electrocatalytic performance of CoNiP@PPy@PANI/rGO electrode material with a potential of 0.414V versus SCE to drive a high current density of 26.92 mAcm(-2), lower onset potential of 0.204 V versus SCE, and higher electrochemically active surface area of 2.08 x 10(-1) cm(2)mg(-1) were achieved. Furthermore, the electrochemical activities, kinetics, and stability of CoNiP@PPy@PANI/rGO remarkably outperformed the commercial NiP and CoNiP towards alkaline urea electro-oxidation. Therefore, a novel material, CoNiP@PPy@PANI/rGO, is an excellent candidate for anode electrode material in direct urea fuel cells.

Complete mass balances are simultaneously established in both aqueous and gas phases for large urea conversion rates (>80%). The results provide clear evidence (with a maximal deviation of 2%) that, in addition to N-2, N-overoxidized by-products are produced during the UEO. Electrolyses conducted with human urine samples under identical operating conditions result in different distributions of N and C-by-products. In particular, the formation of formic and oxalic acids in these latter experiments suggests the presence of different and/or additional mechanistic pathways during the UEO process. The amount of H-2 generated at the cathode is also quantified, showing a reduction of 30% in energy consumption when compared with water electrolysis. Finally, this study assesses the energy efficiency of UEO with urea synthetic and real-matrix effluents, thereby contributing to the development of this sustainable process, which enables energy recovery from waste.

The materials were tested as electrocatalysts for urea electro-oxidation reaction (UER) in alkaline media. From Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), it was observed that the agglomeration of the nickel nanoparticles increased as the deposition time by PLD increased. Regarding UER, the maximum current density from cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments, normalized by electroactive surface area (ESA), on NiNP/CC 20s catalysts was about 35.5% and 67.9% higher than that one obtained using NiNP/CC 40s and NiNP/CC 60s catalysts. The results from chronoamperometry (CA) measurements showed the same trend. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements proved that the charge transfer resistance significantly decreased for UER process as the electrocatalytic activity of nickel nanoparticles increased. Thus, NiNP/CC 20s stands out as the best catalyst for UER in this study, probably due its small size of the particle's agglomeration and its better dispersion on the carbon cloth (CC), the support material.

But the shortage of cost-effective electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and durability restricts its practical development. Herein, the partially amorphous fluorine-decorated nickel iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-F) is constructed via a low-temperature fluoridation method. Our study found that HF acid etching of NiFe LDH precursor resulted in the partially amorphous feature and abundant oxygen vacancies, providing rich reaction sites. Simultaneously, the formation of ionic metal-F bond makes it easier to form high-valence metal oxygen hydroxide active sites. Specifically, the as-prepared NiFe-F-4 electrode demonstrates a superb mass activity of 1290 mA mg(-1) at 1.6 V vs. RHE. Further experiments found that amorphous structure and F decorating decreased the activation energy of UOR from 30.71 kJ mol(-1) (crystalline NiFe-F-4) to 20.17 kJ mol(-1) (amorphous NiFe-F-4), leading to a rapid dynamic with a small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec-1. Moreover, NiFe-F-4 casts remarkable long-term durability for 40 h without performance decay.

The catalytic potential of VO(acac)(L) and VO(L)(2) has been examined in the (ep)oxidation of alkenes (cis-cyclooctene and 1-octene) by an aqueous hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, TBHP. The effects of temperature, solvent and oxidant/alkene molar ratio are studied in order to get the optimized reaction conditions. Most of the catalytic (ep)oxidation products of cis-cyclooctene and 1-octene are determined qualitatively and quantitatively using gas chromatographic analysis. The increase of the catalyst amount to double time reduces the (ep)oxidation process time with improvement of the amount of the chemoselective epoxy product.

The rational construction of atomic and electronic structure is crucial for nickel-based LDHs to realize their satisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, we report a facile, ecofriendly, one-step synthesis process to construct petal-like oxygen-deficient NiAl-LDH nanosheets for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The as-prepared NiAl-LDH nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies possess a large specific surface area of 216.6 m(2) and a desirable electronic conductivity of 3.45 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) to deliver an ultra-high specific capacitance of 2801 F g(-1) (700 C g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1). Furthermore, high specific energy of 50.0 W h kg(-1) at 400 W kg(-1) and excellent cycle stability with 91% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles are achieved by the NiAl-LDHs/ CFP (carbon fiber paper) (+)//YP-80F (a commercial activated carbon) (-) HSC. Besides, NiAl-LDH nanosheets also work as an efficient electrocatalyst for UOR, which only requires 1.42 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 mol L-1 KOH with 0.33 mol urea. This remarkable performance is superior to most reported values of previous candidates owing to the thin structure of NiAl-LDH nanosheets for exposing more active sites and abundant oxygen vacancies. In addition, various reaction parameters are investigated to optimize the electrochemical performance. In general, this work paves a new way for the architecture of multifunctional nanostructured energy materials.

In response, for the first time the robust UOR catalysts are developed via in-situ construction of the Fe -doped Ni12P5/Ni3P heterojunction nanosheets on the macroporous 3D NiFe foam skeleton (denoted as Fe-(Ni12P5/Ni3P)). The introduction of Fe element can not only strengthen the interfacial electric field and induce the spontaneous charge redistribution for heterogeneous Ni12P5/Ni3P, but also effectively lower the reaction energy barrier during stepwise UOR process. Benefiting from the unique ultra-thin nanosheets and the optimized electronic structure, the well-designed Fe-(Ni12P5/Ni3P) possesses more exposed active sites and faster electron and mass transfer, thus exhibiting superior catalytic UOR activity. Encouragingly, the Fe-(Ni12P5/Ni3P) can deliver the industrial-level current density of 800 mA cm-2 just at 1.4 V as well as a splendid Tafel slope of 28.2 mV dec- 1. This catalyst also manifests remarkable durability under high current densities. As a consequence, our work opens up a brand-new-path in rational design of excellent UOR catalysts with high activity and stability to enable energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production on industrial scale.

In this study, we synthesized Cu, Co co-doped Ni3S2 nanosheets on nickel foam (Cu/Co-Ni3S2/NF) through a two-step hydrothermal reaction. Cu, Co dual-doped Ni3S2 nanosheets exhibited a thickness of about 30 nm, composed of nanoparticles. Benefiting from the synergistic regulation of Cu and Co dopants on electronic structure, increased availability of active sites, boosted electron transference rates, and improved electrical conductivity, Cu/Co-Ni3S2/NF exhibited an excellent UOR catalytic performance and enhanced reaction kinetics, offering a low potential of 1.350 V at 100 mA cm-2, along with a low Tafel slope of 15.5 mV dec-1. Moreover, Cu/ Co-Ni3S2/NF coupled with Pt/C/NF only necessitated 1.68 V to drive 100 mA cm-2 for overall urea splitting, which is lower than that of traditional water splitting (1.996 V). This indicates that the addition of urea into electrolyte is an energy-conserving strategy for hydrogen production from water electrolysis. This work provides a novel dual-ion doping method to design a highly efficient electrocatalysts for UOR.

NiCoPO/NF presents the relatively prominent OER and UOR activities with ultralow potentials of 1.51 V and 1.34 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) to reach the current density of 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The outstanding UOR and OER performance of NiCoPO/NF might be attributed to the fact that the successful incorporation of oxygen atoms into Ni/Co phosphate is beneficial for the oxidation of metal atoms at high overpotential. In addition, NF can improve the electrical conductivity to accelerate the electron transfer from the electrode to the catalyst. Additionally, in the alkaline solution (1 M KOH), NiCoPO/NF shows excellent durability and stability after the consecutive OER and UOR tests for 48 h. The design of NiCoPO/NF would pave the way to construct more efficient bifunctional electrodes for electrocatalytic water splitting with or without urea in alkaline solution, which provides a novel technological platform for the conversion of human waste into the sustainable energy.					zhang, meng/AAU-5353-2020; Zhao, Zhipeng/ISA-3448-2023	Zhang, Meng/0000-0001-8356-0043													1868-2529	1868-5994				MAR	2023	14	2					247	258		10.1007/s12678-022-00793-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12678-022-00793-9		NOV 2022											WOS:000883274400001

Proteus vulgaris - Pt electrode system for urea to nitrogen conversion in synthetic urine	BIOELECTROCHEMISTRY												One of the most challenging problems when trying to recycle urine for different purposes is the removal of urea. In this project we studied an ureolysis system using the bacterium Proteus vulgaris for the transformation of urea to ammonia and its subsequent oxidation to nitrogen at a Pt working electrode. Our system was tested under different pH, microbial reaction times, and urea and bacteria concentrations. Our results indicate that a pH 8 is optimal for the combined Proteus vulgaris urease activity and the ammonia oxidation reaction at a Pt electrode. The reaction time and concentration dependence on the ammonia oxidation reaction current densities was also studied. Results showed limited ammonia oxidation under high urea concentrations in similar to 2.5 x 10(9) cfu/mL Proteus vulgaris in synthetic urine. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

These nanocomposites were then used as highly effective electrocatalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The strategy involved depositing CNTs onto stainless steel (SS) foam using chemical vapor deposition, followed by pulse-reversal electrodeposition of nickel selenides in a layer-by-layer fabrication process. Different phases of nanostructured nickel selenides, such as NiSe2, NiSe2/Ni0.85Se, and Ni0.85Se, were successfully deposited on the surface of CNTs by controlling the reversal potential. Among all the different nanocomposites, the Ni0.85Se@CNTs-SS electrode exhibited the best electrocatalytic activity towards UOR. It required only a low overpotential, about 158 mV, to reach a benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm- 2, and showed a low Tafel slope value of 85 mV dec- 1. Additionally, the results of the prolonged stability study for 24 h confirmed the remarkable electrochemical stability of the Ni0.85Se@CNTs-SS electrode. After conducting stability studies, the overpotential shifted from 158 mV to 107 mV. This shift is due to the activation of the electrocatalyst during the stability test. The excellent electrocatalytic activity observed after the stability test is attributed to the presence of hydroxide and oxyhydroxide phases, which are remarkably active phases. This is the first-ever report where the Ni0.85Se@CNTs-SS nanocomposite electrode is shown to hold great potential as an effective electrocatalyst for UOR, which is an important step toward the design of a future electrocatalyst for UOR.

Herein, we demonstrated the urea oxidation catalyzed by NiSe2 nanorod could be greatly improved by Fe doping strategy. The Fe-doping effect was probed by density functional theory which revealed that doping could enhance the interface electric field inducing the charge redistribution near the Ni atom, and enhancing the adsorption capacity of Ni to urea molecules. As a result, the balanced interaction of Fe/Ni synergism and the Ni active site exposure can be realized by tuning the Fe doped amount in the system, which would greatly impact the catalytic ability and intrinsic performance. The NiSe2 with 1.68 at.% iron doping demonstrated the highest catalytic performance for urea oxidation, displaying the largest surface-active area, highly efficient kinetics, fast charge transfer rate, and outstanding stability. The current density of 125.8 mA cm-2 for urea oxidation catalyzed by Fe doped NiSe2 electrode was obtained at 1.54 V vs. RHE when supported on the glassy carbon electrode, almost 4.4 times that of the pristine NiSe2 electrode. When constructed in the two-electrode system combined with the commercial Pt/C cathode, the cell voltage used for urea electrolysis was 1.45 V to provide the specific current density of 10 mA cm-2, approximately 170 mV lower than that of pure water electrolysis, indicating the potential application of hydrogen generation for urea-assisted water splitting.					tian, zhiqun/L-8074-2019; Feng, Ligang/E-9507-2014	Feng, Ligang/0000-0001-9879-0773													0013-4686	1873-3859				FEB 1	2023	440								141724	10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141724		DEC 2022											WOS:000909743200001

It is essential to search a facile anodic reaction to replace OER in the hydrogen generation process. Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an alternative strategy to instead of OER in the water splitting reaction. Based on this, we successfully prepare two-dimensional (2D) CoP nanosheets embedded by carbon nanoparticles (CoP/C) composites as bifunctional catalysts to achieve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at cathode and UOR at anode simultaneously. Benefiting from the presence of carbon particles and 2D sheet structure of CoP in the composites, the contact area of electrolyte/electrode is enlarged, the exposed active sites are increased, and charge transfer rate is improved. As the anode and cathode catalysts in a two-electrode system with continuous electrolyte supplementation by a flow reactor, the CoP/C-3 composite only need 1.40 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the 1 M KOH electrolyte with 0.1 M urea.

It is observed that the conditions for the gel formation strongly affect the morphology and electrochemical properties of the catalyst materials. As synthesized Ni-catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The Ni-based catalyst prepared at optimum conditions in the scope of this study exhibits the urea oxidation activity of 570 mA mg(-1) (at 0.54 V). In a single urea/hydrogen peroxide fuel cell test, the Ni-catalyst provides maximum power densities of 19.6 and 36.4 mW cm(-2) at 30 and 70 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the cell catalyst shows a stable voltage for 3 days.

One of the limitations of the electrochemical water splitting method is the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which leads to an increase in overpotential and a decrease in hydrogen production efficiency. Here, Ni-Mo-S ultra-thin nanosheets were synthesized using the pulse reverse electrochemical deposition technique, and then this electrode was used as an electrode material for accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Remarkably, the optimized electrode needs only 74 mV to attain the 10 mA cm-2 current density in HER and require only 1.3 V vs RHE potential in the UOR process. Also, results showed that the replacement of the UOR with the OER process resulted in a significant improvement in the electrochemical production of hydrogen in which for delivering the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in overall urea electrolysis, only 1.384 V is needed. In addition, outstanding catalytic stability was obtained, after 50 h electrolysis, the voltage variation was negligible. Such outstanding catalytic activity and stability was due to 3-D ultrathin nanosheets, the synergistic effect between elements, and the superhydrophilic/ superaerophobic nature of fabricated electrode. & COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The present work rationally designed and fabricated Ni2P-Ni12P5 heterostructure with varying relative ratios embedded on the defective carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus substrate (Ni2P-Ni12P5/CNP) for high-performance UOR in alkaline conditions through a facile solution-combustion route without extra phosphorus sources. The developed synthesis method avoids the high cost, complicated routes, and extremely toxic emissions. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrated that the Ni2P-Ni12P5 heterostructure regulated the interfacial electric field and promoted electron transfer. The abundantly defective CNP substrate improved the electrical conductivity and prevented Ni2P-Ni12P5 heterostructure from corrosion and detachment. The optimal electrocatalyst, with an approximately equal content of Ni2P and Ni12P5, exhibits a low potential of 1.32 V to deliver 100 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 31.4 mV dec- 1, robust stability of 80 h in UOR, and a low voltage of 1.85 V to reach 100 mA cm-2 in HER||UOR.

J	Song, W; Zhu, CY; Safikhani, A				Song, Wei; Zhu, Chaoyun; Safikhani, Azim			Binder-free electrochemical deposition of 3-D superhydrophilic Cu-Fe-P nanostructure for improving urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Electrochemical water splitting, which includes the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions at the cathode and anode surface is one of the eco-friendly and sustainable approaches for hydrogen production. However, due to the needing for high overpotentials in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, electrochemical water splitting still is not economical process. Therefore, replacing the OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can provide more effective hydrogen production opportunities. Therefore, in this study, by using the electrodeposition process at high current densities and substantial evolution of hydrogen bubbles during the process, the three-dimensional and nanostructured Cu-Fe-P electrode was synthesized. Due to the high active surface area, electrolyte diffusion into all the pores, rapid separation of bubbles, and being binder-free, the deposited Cu-Fe-P electrode at an applied current density of 2 A.cm-2 has the best electrocatalytic perfor-mance. It was represented that the value of the needed overpotential for achieving the current density of 10 mA.cm-2 (eta 10) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was only 56 mV, and the potential value for obtaining the same current density in the UOR was only 1.295 V (vs RHE). Similarly, when this electrode was used as a bi-functional electrode in the water-urea electrolysis process, the value of cell voltage was 1.365 V. Also, the prepared catalyst indicated excellent electrocatalytic stability. This work suggests a simple and ultra-fast method for economic electrochemical hydrogen production.																			1572-6657	1873-2569				DEC 15	2022	927								116993	10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116993		NOV 2022											WOS:000899352100004

UOR has a thermodynamic advantage over oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and only requires 0.37 V (vs RHE), which is considered as an effective alternative to H2 production by water electrolysis. However, the inevitable kinetic slowness and complex adsorption/desorption during process, hindering its practical application. Most traditional catalysts utilized for the UOR are comprised of precious metals, resulting in limited economic viability. Inspired by natural ureases, Ni-based catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives owing to their rich deposits, low cost, and the regulated d orbitals of transition metal Ni, demonstrating considerable potential for UOR. Currently, numerous studies have explored Ni-based hydroxides, oxides, chalcogenides, and phosphides in alkaline solutions. In this review, we will explore the UOR reaction mechanism and summarize the catalyst design strategies of various Ni-based catalysts recently, especially Ni-MOF, which has been rarely discussed before. Then, the broad prospects of UOR in practical applications are summarized. Finally, based on the design strategies and performance comparisons discussed above, the challenges and prospects facing the future development of Ni-based electrocatalysts for the UOR will be presented.

Electrochemical oxidation-reduction and determination o urea at enzyme free PPY-GO electrode	CARBON LETTERS												This manuscript explains the effective determination of urea by redox cyclic voltammetric analysis, for which a modified polypyrrole-graphene oxide (PPY-GO, GO 20% w/w of PPY) nanocomposite electrode was developed. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed an effective electron transfer in 0.1 M KOH electrolytic solution in the potential window range of 0 to 0.6 V. This PPY-GO modified electrode exhibited a moderate electrocatalytic effect towards urea oxidation, thereby allowing its determination in an electrolytic solution. The linear dependence of the current vs. urea concentration was reached using square-wave voltammetry in the concentration range of urea between 0.5 to 3.0 mu M with a relatively low limit of detection of 0.27 mu M. The scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the morphologies and properties of the nanocomposite layer, along with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results indicated that the nanocomposite film modified electrode exhibited a synergistic effect, including high conductivity, a fast electron-transfer rate, and an inherent catalytic ability.

In this work, we demonstrated the synthesis of a HER-UOR bifunctional self-supported composite electrode, composed of metal-organic framework-derived low-Ru-content-doped Co2P nanoparticles/N-doped carbon composite nanosheets supported on 3D Ni foam substrates (Ru-Co2P/N-C/NF). Benefiting from the synergism of compositional and structural merits, the resultant self-supported Ru-Co2P/N-C/NF composite exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for both HER and UOR. Remarkably, the two-electrode urea electrolysis system composed of the bifunctional Ru-Co2P/N-C/NF composite electrode as both the cathode and anode could achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with a voltage of 1.58 V in 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea.

Herein, urea-assisted water electrolysis was demonstrated efficiently on the catalyst system of iron oxide promoted nickel/nickel oxide rough nanorods. With the help of a series of physical characterization and electrochemical measurements, the content of iron oxide in the system was found to largely influence the crystal structure, roughness and electrochemically active surface area as well as the electrochemical mechanism. The sample with the Fe/Ni ratio of 0.5:1 showed the best water and urea oxidation catalytic performance because of the largest surface area and rapid charge transfer rate and efficient kinetics in the rate-determining step. As a urea-assisted water elec-trolysis catalyst, the current density can reach 30 mA cm(-2) at 1.45 V, about 20 times higher than that of pure water oxidation; the cell voltage as low as 1.49 V can afford 10 mA cm(-2) for urea electrolysis, about 120 mV lower than that of pure water electrolysis in the two-electrode catalytic systems. Considering the low price of Ni and Fe and anti-corrosion ability in the electrolyte, the current work is instructive for the efficient catalyst fabrication and urea-containing wastewater purifying.

However, the strong binding between Ni3+ and *COO makes *COO difficult to desorption, it is difficult for most nickel -based catalysts to meet the activity requirements. Herein, P and W co -doped carbonencapsulated NiCo (P-W-NiCo@C) nanoparticles/nanosheets structure catalysts was synthesized via hydrothermal method and calcination to enhance the activity and durability of Ni based catalysts toward UOR. As expected, the carbon -coated structure was found to facilitate the transfer of electrons from NiCo alloy to the carbon layer, while the introduction of P and W optimized the electronic structure of the central metal site. Benefiting from the co -doped, carbon -encapsulated, alloying, electron interaction and nanoparticles/nanosheets structure, P-W-NiCo@C can deliver current density of 300 mA cm -2 at 1.34 V (vs. RHE) during the UOR. Most importantly, P-W-NiCo@C as cathode and anode catalyst still has good electrochemical properties in artificial urine (E10/300 = 1.13/2.17 V), indicating that P-W-NiCo@C has potential practical application value in electrolyzing urea rich wastewater.

In this work, carbon nanofibers were decorated with nickel sulphide nanoparticles [NiS@CNFs] through the electrospinning technique with subsequent heating into an argon atmosphere at 900 degrees C for 2 h. This formed nanomaterial was extensively characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Raman spectroscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements. A conductive network of intertwined CNFs was clearly detected by FE-SEM analysis technique with varied diameters in the range of 0.6-1 mu m. A highly porous nature could be suggested after incorporating NiS nanospecies resulting in increased specific surface area and valuable electrocatalytic activity for urea molecules electro-oxidation. The pore size distribution curves showed a decreased average pore diameter for NiS@CNFs nanocomposite by 2.53 folds when compared to that at CNFs. The electroactivity of NiS@CNFs nanomaterial for catalyzing urea electro-oxidation was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Increased activity of this nanocatalyst was registered when urea molecules were added in increased concentrations into KOH solution. Lowered resistance values were also obtained describing the charge transfer process to confirm the feasibility of the studied reaction at NiS@CNFs surface. Moreover, its drawn chronoamperogram showed a stable performance during operation for long periods revealing a lowered catalytic decay. Accordingly, the aforementioned results of our fabricated nanomaterial could provide a good guide for fabricating suitable electrocatalysts for various electrocatalytic purposes.

J	Dong, Q; Wang, YH; Du, XQ; Zhang, XS				Dong, Qiang; Wang, Yanhong; Du, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Xiaoshuang			Controlled synthesis of Mo and Ni codoped Co2P as environmentally friendly catalyst for urea, freshwater and seawater oxidation	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												The thermodynamic equilibrium potential of urea electrolysis (0.37 V) is lower than that of conventional water electrolysis (1.23 V). In this paper, the urea oxidation reaction performance of Ni-Co2P was regulated and enhanced by doping with different quantity of Mo. The growth characteristics of Mo doping Ni-Co2P were characterized and analyzed to reveal the electrochemical properties of the target catalysts, and finally the electrochemical performance tests were carried out. The experimental results show that MoNi-Co2P-0.12 electrode exhibits superior catalytic activity and durability at an iR compensation of 90. What is noteworthy is that at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, the MoNi-Co2P-0.12 catalyst showed an ultra-low voltage of 1.244 V with a small Tafel slope (79.52 mV dec- 1) and stable catalysis for over 12 h, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported to date. Experimental results show that the increased activity of the MoNi-Co2P-0.12 catalyst is attributable to synergic catalytic effect of Mo and Co, electron regulation and exposure of more active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the doping of Mo can increase the urea adsorption energy of the MoNi-Co2P material compared with the Ni-Co2P material, and is also conducive to the improvement of the conductivity of the MoNi-Co2P material. This work provides new research into the use of cheap transition metal catalysts as an alternative to precious metal catalysts for urea electrolysis.																			0925-8388	1873-4669				DEC 10	2023	967								171695	10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.171695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.171695		AUG 2023											WOS:001062034400001

It's worth noting that electrochemistry activity can be significantly improved by reasonably regulating the electron configuration around the active site for the doped materials. In this work, a series of well-tuned Ni doped CoWO4 nanoarrays on Ni foam supports have been prepared through a typical hydrothermal approach for the first time. Moreover, the resulting Ni-CoWO4-2 material significantly promotes urea oxidation performance with an applied potential of 1.35 V at 50 mA cm(-2), which is lower than that of water oxidation reaction (1.60 V). Density functional theory results suggest that the Ni doped CoWO4 has larger urea adsorption energy compared with CoWO4 and the CO(NH2)(2) molecule is strongly adsorbed on surface of Ni doped CoWO4, which is beneficial to accelerate the kinetics of the reaction and improve the electrocatalytic activity of the urea electrolysis.

The binary cooperative heterostructure systems have been shown significant enhancement for catalyzing UOR, but their performance still remains unsatisfactory for industrialization because of the unfavorable intermediate adsorption/desorption and deficient electron transfer channels. In response, taking the ternary cooperative Ni5P4/NiSe2/Ni3Se4 heterostructure as the proof-of-concept paradigm, a catalytic model is rationally put forward to elucidate the UOR promotion mechanism at the molecular level. The rod-like Ni5P4/ NiSe2/Ni3Se4 nanoarrays with three-phase heterojunction are experimentally fabricated on Ni foam (named as Ni5P4/NiSe2/Ni3Se4/NF) via simple two-step processes. The density functional theory calculations disclose that construction of Ni5P4/NiSe2/Ni3Se4 heterostructure model not only induce charge redistribution at the interfacial region for creating innumerable electron transfer channels, but also endow it with a moderate d-band center that could help to build a balance between adsorption and desorption of diverse UOR intermediates. Benefiting from the unique rod-like nanoarrays with large specific surface area and the optimized electronic structure, the well-designed Ni5P4/NiSe2/Ni3Se4/NF could act as a robust catalyst for driving UOR at industrial-level current densities under tough environments, offering great potential for commercial applications.& COPY; 2023 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Morphological characterizations confirm the existence of nanosheets, and XPS spectra indicate that the content of Ni3+ species in Ni3+-rich Ni(OH)(2)/C-NH2 (ca. 57.6%) is significantly higher than that of in Ni(OH)(2)/C-NH2 (ca. 43.1%) and Ni(OH)(2)/C (ca. 20.7%). Electrochemical analyses illustrate that the as-prepared Ni3+-rich Ni(OH)(2)/C-NH2 catalyst exhibits the highest current density (91.72 rnA cm(-2)) at a potential of 0.61 V, which is 2.06-, 2.08- and 3.47-fold higher than that of Ni(OH)(2)/C-NH2,Ni(OH)(2)/C and Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, the Ni3+-rich Ni(OH)(2)/C-NH2 catalyst also demonstrates an outstanding voltammetric cycles and long-term chronoamperometric stability. The superior electrocatalytic activity and stability could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of Ni3+ doping as well as the amine-fimctionalized carbon, where higher concentration Ni3+ species in Ni(OH)(2) sheets could provide more active sites for adsorption and transformation of urea molecules, while fluffy C-NH2 support could enhance the ability of solute diffusion, electron transport and gas emissions, thereby dramatically improve the catalytic activity.

In this work, we report Se-Ni(OH)(2)-shelled vertically oriented NiSe nanowires on a Ni foam as an electrocatalyst toward UOR, showing a low potential of 0.366 V vs. SCE to drive 100 mA cm (2) in alkaline solution and out-performing all the reported non-noble-metal UOR catalysts up to date. Experimental results and theoretical calculation reveal that the vertically and distantly arranged nanowires with highly porous structure produce high mass transport paths for urea to fully access the reaction sites, the NiSe core offers high conductivity for fast electron transport, and the Se-Ni(OH)(2) shell provides large amount of active catalytic sites while lowering the CO2 adsorption/desorption barrier than Ni(OH) 2 for fast reaction kinetics. This work opens up an exciting new direction to design electrocatalysts for high performance fuel cells and other energy applications. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we successfully synthesize a Cr doped CoFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) nanosheets array with uniform growth on a nickel-foam (NF). The partially oxidized Cr6+ during the process of oxidation could adjust the electronic structure and stabilize the high-valence active sites by virtue of its strong electron-withdrawing ability. The calculation of density functional theory (DFT) shows that the incorporation of Cr into CoFe LDH could obviously overcome the step of H2O adsorption during the OER progress. Therefore, the CoFeCr LDH/NF electrode exhibits superior OER performance. Furthermore, when acted as a UOR electrode, its performance is also satisfying. The design of the CoFeCr LDH/NF would hew out a brand-new route to construct more bifunctional electrodes for electrocatalytic water splitting in an alkaline solution with or without urea.

The flower-like architecture and FeS content were controlled by adjusting the amount of L-cysteine during precursor synthesis. Electrochemical properties were explored through a combination of Raman and impedance spectroscopy, revealing the relationship between catalytic performance and the stoichiometry of Bi2S3/FeS. Due to the synergistic interaction of S anions with 3d electrons at the Bi2S3/FeS interface the heterostructures exhibited highly enriched overall water-splitting ability, achieving a remarkably low cathodic and anodic overpotential of 36 and 230 mV for a current density of 10 mA/cm2. Furthermore, the addition of methanol and urea in the electrolyte further enhanced the catalytic efficiency of Bi2S3/FeS, achieving a very high current density of 100 mA/cm2 at exceptionally low potentials of 1.5 V and 1.43 V for methanol and urea oxidation reaction. The excellent electrocatalytic properties of Bi2S3/FeS were attributed to the interactions and interfacial effects between Bi2S3 and FeS, leading to enhanced surface roughness, inhomogeneity, and the creation of additional electrochemically active sites. Notably, Bi2S3/FeS demonstrated long-term stability and excellent mass transportation capabilities, highlighting its potential for various practical applications. The remarkable element gradient in the heterostructures further contributes to their superior performance, making them highly promising candidates for diverse applications.

Herein, P, N-codoped carbon-encapsulated cobalt/nickel phosphides derived from NiCo-MOF-74 (NiCoP@PNC) and anchored on P-doped carbonized wood fiber (PCWF) for UOR were prepared through synchronous carbonization and phosphorization. By benefiting from the synergistic effect of structural and electronic modulation, NiCoP@PNC/PCWF exhibits excellent UOR electrocatalytic performance under alkaline conditions, achieving a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with a potential of only 1.34 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and continuous operation for more than 72 h. In addition, for the overall urea splitting, an electrolyzer using UOR replaced OER, which required only 1.50 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with excellent stability, 230 mV less than that required for the HER||OER system. In-depth theoretical analysis further proves that the strong synergistic effect between Co and Ni optimizes electronic structures, yielding excellent UOR properties. The synergistic strategy of structural and electrical modulation provides broad prospects for the design and synthesis of excellent UOR electrocatalysts for energysaving hydrogen production by using renewable resources.					pi, jihao/GYJ-7625-2022; wu, yi/LZG-1397-2025; Xu, Han/JOZ-1851-2023	Xu, Han/0000-0002-3211-7081													0021-9797	1095-7103				MAR 15	2024	658						846	855		10.1016/j.jcis.2023.12.128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2023.12.128		DEC 2023						38157609					WOS:001166006400001

In this work, various ratio (0.01, 0.03, and 0.05 mmol) of cobalt (Co), and iron (Fe) doped nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) nanosheet arrays were grown on Ni foam surface (Co-Ni(OH)(2) and Fe-Ni(OH)(2)) via a simple one-step process. The Co-Ni(OH)(2) and Fe-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet array on Ni foam electrodes were explored as potential candidate towards electro-oxidation of urea. Notably, 0.03 mmol Co doped Ni(OH)(2)/Ni foam electrode displayed lowest-onset oxidation potential (0.21 V) and enhanced electro-oxidation of urea (59.7 mA) owing to its large amount of electrocatalytic active sites, densely assembled nanosheet array structures with porous surfaces, and electronic diffusion channels, which might promote interface electrochemical reaction. In addition, synergistic effect between Co metal with Ni(OH)(2) has also promotes enhanced electro-oxidation of urea in contrast to Fe-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet array, Ni(OH)(2), and Ni foam electrodes. Chronoamperometric i-t curve of Co-Ni(OH)(2)/Ni foam electrode obviously exhibited higher catalytic current, highly stable and durable properties in contrast to Fe-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays. As-fabricated Co-Ni(OH)(2)/Ni foam can be explored as a new type of potential low-cost catalyst for electro-oxidation of urea, which reveals promising use in future fuel cell energy applications.

Therefore, in this paper, hierarchical structure NiSe@Ni12P5/NCF with Ni12P5 nanorod arrays coupled with NiSe nanospheres are synthesized on bare nickel-copper foam (NCF) by exogenous phosphorylation and subsequent electrodeposition methods. The catalytic performance of hierarchical structure NiSe@Ni12P5/NCF in ureaassisted electrolytic water reaction is studied in focus. The results show that the potential of NiSe@Ni12P5/ NCF was only 1.267 V and 1.412 V vs RHE at current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, in addition to no significant activity decay after 140 h stability test. This is attributed to the fact that the introduction of NiSe regulated the interfacial charge distribution, creating an interfacial coupling effect that can greatly increase the original catalytic species, as well as the NiOOH species generated during the UOR process as true active sites, which ultimately improving the electrocatalytic UOR performance of NiSe@Ni12P5/NCF.

In this study, a few layers of exfoliated graphene sheets are engineered with novel high entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles through mechanical milling technique followed by sonication. Three different HEA-Graphene (HEA-G) composites were produced with the metalto-graphene weight ratio of 50:50, 70:30 and 90:10. As-synthesized HEA-G composites were extensively characterized through microscopy (AFM and TEM) and spectroscopic (Raman) techniques to understand the HEA nanoparticle formation and distribution over the surface of graphene sheets. Further, the catalytic behaviour of HEA-G composites was examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) to understand the non-enzymatic oxidation of urea using the HEA-G composites. The onset of the catalytic behaviour was observed with the composite 50:50 which was increased till 70:30 composite. However, the 90:10 composition exhibited minimal catalytic response compared to the other two composites. The composite 70:30 being the best performer was used to derive sensitivity based on the oxidation of urea which was found to be 37.4 mu Am M-1 cm(-2).

In this work, the Ni3S2/Ni heterostructure nanobelt arrays supported on nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni/NF) are synthesized for accelerating the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It only needs ultralow potentials of 1.30 V and -54 mV to achieve the current density of +/- 10 mA cm(-2) for UOR and HER, respectively. Meanwhile, the overall urea oxidation driven by Ni3S2/Ni/NF only needs 1.36 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), and it can remain at 100 mA cm(-2) for 60 h without obvious activity attenuation. The superior performance could be attributed to the heterostructure between Ni3S2 and Ni, which can promote electron transfer and form electron-poor Ni species to optimize urea decomposition and hydrogen production. Moreover, the nanobelt self-supported structure could expose abundant active sites. This work thus provides a feasible and cost-effective strategy for urea-rich wastewater degradation and hydrogen production.

However, the state-of-the art UOR suffers from the sluggish kinetics because of the 6 e(-) transfer process involvement. Herein, as a proof-of-concept study, we synthesized the Ni-III -rich nickel diselenide nanoflake through a facile hydrothermal reaction. Compared to the counterpart nickel (oxy) hydroxide, the selenylation processing of nickel successfully produces synergetic effects of more exposed active sites and effective electron transports. Particularly, due to the Ni-III -rich nature of the as-synthesized nickel diselenide, the reduction/oxidation reactions between Ni-II and Ni-III is greatly accelerated, which in turn effectively decreases the required overpotentials, prolongate the catalytic lifetime, giving rise to the significantly enhanced UOR performances. In-depth mechanistic analysis evidences that the restructure of nickel diselenide (vs. nickel oxide hydroxide) could be the main reason for affording the decent UOR activity as the oxidation from Ni-II to Ni-III was simultaneous occurred during the selenide species disappear process, a result that may be extended to other selenide-based systems.

The NiO-SnO2 composite, prepared via hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent annealing at different temperatures (400 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 600 degrees C), demonstrated excellent catalytic performance, and attributed to its unique dual-phase structure comprising monoclinic NiO and tetragonal SnO2. XRD, SEM, and XPS analyses confirmed the material's crystallinity, morphology, and chemical states, highlighting the role of annealing temperature in optimizing structural properties. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the composite annealed at 600 degrees C exhibited superior OER and UOR activities, with overpotentials of 320 mV and 140 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm-2.

Through the strong interfacial interaction and electron synergistic coupling between 3D CeOx nanoflower and 2D Co2P nanosheet, the as-prepared Co2P-CeOx/NF exhibited high conductivity, catalytic activity and stability, and enhanced the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance. Assembling an electrolyzer with a straight substitution of UOR for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) , it needed only 1.42 V to achieve a current density of 30 mA/cm(2), which was 0.17 V less than that required for water splitting. After 10 h of electrocatalysis, the degradation efficiency of urea reached 76.4%, realizing the preparation of clean energy hydrogen and synchronous wastewater purification, opening up a new path for green energy development and environmental governance. Based on the comprehensive analysis above, the electron transfer at the heterogeneous interfaces between 2D Co2P nanosheet and 3D CeOx nanoflower would cause the rearrangement of surface/interfacial charges ; the formed oxygen vacancies provided coordination unsaturated sites, exposed more active sites, optimized the adsorption energy of reactant molecules on the catalyst surface and promoted molecular activation, making it have higher catalytic activity.

Ni-tethered MoS2: In-situ fast reduction synthesis as an ultra-durable and highly active electrocatalyst for water splitting and urea oxidation	MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY												Developing an extraordinarily robust and efficient green electrocatalyst derived from earth-abundant elements is becoming an important part of green hydrogen generation. We present here a simple single-step in-situ fast reduction synthesis of Ni-tethered MoS2 (NiMoS2), which exhibits excellent activity for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), and Urea Oxidation Reaction (UOR). To supply 10 mA cm(-2) current density, the active catalyst NiMoS2 exhibits minor overpotentials of 141 mV vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) for HER, and 250 mV vs RHE for OER in 1.0 M KOH. NiMoS2 displays ultra-durability (over 90 h) with a current loss of <4.6% for OER and <3.6% for HER, respectively. The enhanced trifunctional catalyst NiMoS2/NF enables the construction of a stable behavior water electrolyzer that delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.52 V.

The electrochemical method can be used to synthesize the added product urea while treating N-pollution. Therefore, the development of sufficiently efficient electrosynthesis urea systems and efficient electrocatalysts is of great significance, but also challenging. In this paper, CuNi alloy nanosheets (CuxNiy /CF) on copper foam surface were synthesized by electrodeposition, and C-N coupled hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) system was constructed by proton exchange membrane (PEM). Cu and Ni in CuNi alloy act as double active sites and react with C-N coupling reaction and HzOR respectively. At -0.5 V potential, the Faraday efficiency of Cu8Ni2/CF for C-N coupling reaction is 51.66 %, and the urea yield is 254.09 mu g h-1 cm-2. At the same time, HzOR with low thermodynamic oxidation potential can quickly produce excess H+ to supply protons to the cathode for C-N coupling reaction, thus significantly promoting the forward C-N coupling reaction. Cu1Ni9/CF also showed significant activity in the oxidation reaction of N2H4 in KOH electrolyte. Therefore, we assembled a Cu1Ni9(+) || Cu8Ni2(-) electrolytic cell, which only needs 0.23 V working voltage up to 150 mA cm-2, and can convert NO3 - and CO2 to urea at a power consumption of 5.09 kWh kg-1 while converting N2H4. Energy saving 37.6 % compared to conventional C-N coupled OER electrolytic system (about 8.16 kWh kg- 1 urea). It can greatly reduce the cost of urea production, make the price of fertilizer and chemical raw materials more competitive, and promote the development of agriculture and chemical industry while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen pollutants in the ecological environment. This study reports a promising and effective strategy for the synthesis of urea and treatment of N contaminants at a small operating voltage.

Herein, manganese-doped nickel phosphide nanosheets (Mn-Ni2P) are constructed and employed for driving UOR. Comprehensive analysis deciphers that Mn doping could efficiently accelerate the surface reconstruction of Mn-Ni2P electrode, generating highly reactive NiOOH-MnOOH heterostructure with local nucleophilic and electrophilic regions. Such unique structure could accelerate the targeted adsorption and activation of C and N atoms, promoting fracture of C-N bond in urea. In addition, moderate Mn doping could efficiently enhance the adsorption capacities of urea molecules and some key intermediates, and minish the energy barrier for *CO2 desorption, accelerating refreshing of the catalyst. Consequently, the Mn-Ni2P electrode exhibits excellent UOR catalytic activity, achieving an industrial-level current density of 1000 mA cm-2 at 1.46 V (vs. RHE).					li, xin/JAC-2532-2023	Ding, Haoran/0009-0009-7655-0299													0043-1354	1879-2448				APR 1	2024	253								121266	10.1016/j.watres.2024.121266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121266		FEB 2024						38394933					WOS:001196680600001

Due to the sluggish anodic reaction of water splitting, exploration of high-efficiency and cost-effective electrocatalysts enabling low driving potential for hydrogen generation is highly desirable. Here, we report a bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of two-dimensional NiCo-BDC nano sheet arrays coated with Ni-S thin layers, presenting promising catalytic activity and durability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Impressively, this anode could reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 229 mV in 1.0 M KOH for OER. For UOR, only a small potential of 1.31 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) is required for driving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. Furthermore, a full electrochemical cell was constructed using the as-prepared catalyst as anode and the Pt/C as cathode. For overall water splitting, only a low potential of 1.53 V is required to gain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, whereas the urea-mediated electrolysis cell demonstrates a lower operating potentials of 1.46 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work presents a solid step towards lowing the driving potential for hydrogen generation via water splitting.

Co-UPDI as photocatalyst exhibits more an order of magnitude of POE rate than UPDI at pH = 4.8 (8.00 vs. 0.58 mmol h(-1)g(-1)), which is the highest among reported POE tests in aqueous colloid system with AgNO3 as sacrificial agent. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) reaches 4.39 % at 450 nm. The systematical experiments reveals that the heterojunction formation between UPDI line and Co(NO3)(2) molecules is crucial through the coordination of Co with N atoms. Consequently, the rigidity of UPDI line enhances, H-type stacking of PDI moiety becomes closer, and CoOOH as cocatalyst in-situ forms during POE. Meanwhile, more excitons with longer lifetime generate and more quickly transfer in Co-UPDI than UPDI nanocrystals. This work provides an efficient strategy for photocatalytic water oxidation.

X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopy analyses show different degrees of electronic structure modulation of the Ni site due to the doping of the third metals having different t2g and eg occupancies. Cr reduces the energy needed for the in-situ formation of the oxyhydroxide, followed by Ti, V, and Ag. The reaction kinetics is accelerated by Ti, followed by Ag, Cr, and Zn. Ti also optimizes the d-band center and CO2 adsorption energy, which is supported by density functional theory calculation. Self-reconstructed sulfatecontaining oxyhydroxide during UOR is demonstrated via in-situ Raman and post-transmission electron microscopy analyses. The sulfate is also found to affect the potential required for the formation of the oxyhydroxide. The optimized NiFeTi-containing sulfide exhibits an excellent UOR potential of 1.36 V at 100 mA cm-2 and is stable up to 80-h.

In this paper, NiMoO4 nanospheres doped with Cr and P were con-structed by hydrothermal method and phosphating process as electrocatalysts for water splitting, and the doping of Cr and P effectively modulated the electronic structure, which led to an increase in the active sites and an increase in the intrinsic activity of each site. Notably, Cr/P-NiMoO4@NF presented excellent urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance (1.312V @ 10 mA cm-2) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (overpotential 309 mV @ 10 mA cm-2) in electrolytes of 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH with 0.5 M urea because of the doping effect of Cr and P. The experimental analysis showed that the improvement of electrochemical performance was mainly reflected in the accelerated electron transfer rate, increased exposure of reaction sites and improved metal properties and so on. For Cr/ P-NiMoO4@NF, after a long time UOR and OER stability test, some changes have taken place in the appearance of the sample, which increases the contact area and provides more active sites, making the catalytic performance of the sample have no too obvious attenu-ation. Density functional theory calculation shows that the Cr/P-NiMoO4 material exhibits higher urea adsorption energy, indicating that urea is preferentially adsorbed on its surface. The Cr/P-NiMoO4 material shows more state density near the Fermi level, indi-cating that the introduction of Cr and P enhances the conductivity of the Cr/P-NiMoO4 material. This work provides a novel idea for the research and exploitation of low cost and robust UOR and OER electrocatalysts. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the direct application in electrocatalysis are usually limited by their poor electrocatalysis performance. Herein, we present the synthesis of Ni/Co bimetallic organic framework with missing linkers of carboxyferrocene (NiCoMOF-Fc) on nickel foam (NF) by a facile protocol of one-step solvothermal method for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) electrocatalysis. The integration of defect tailoring and bimetallic coupling effect changes the coordination environment of Ni active sites and optimizes the electronic structure, which significantly improves the electrocatalytic activity of the Ni-based MOF. The NiCoMOF-Fc modified NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance towards UOR with high current density at low potential (140 mA cm-2 at 1.299 V vs. RHE and 782 mA cm-2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE), a small Tafel slope of 46.2 mV dec- 1 and good durability. In addition, a two-electrode electrolyser with NiCoMOF-Fc as the bifunctional catalyst for UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has also been suc-cessfully constructed, which shows bright prospect of practical use.

In the present work, hierarchical coassembled cobalt molybdenum sulfide nanosheets deposited on carbon cloth (CC) were synthesized as catalysts for hydrogen evolution and urea oxidation. By adjusting the doping amount of Mo, 2D nanosheets with different morphologies and compositions (CoxMoyS-CC) can be obtained. The asprepared nanosheet materials with abundant active sites exhibit superior properties on the electrochemical HER and UOR in alkaline medium. Significantly, the Mo-doping concentration and composition of the formed nanosheets have large effects on the electrocatalytic activity. The fabricated nanosheets with optimal Mo doping (Co3Mo1S-CC) illustrate the best catalytic properties for the HER in N-2-saturated 1.0 M KOH. A small overpotential (85 mV) is needed to meet the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). This study indicates that the doping of an appropriate amount of molybdenum into CoS2 nanosheets can efficiently improve the catalytic performance. Also, the nanosheet catalyst exhibits an extremely high electrocatalytic activity for the UOR, and the electrochemical results indicate that a relatively low cell voltage of 1.50 V is needed to obtain the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The present work demonstrates the potential application of CoMoS nanosheets in the energy electrocatalysis area and the insights into performance-boosting through heteroatom doping and optimization of the composition and structure.

The Ni/N, S-CNFs was prepared by electrospinning and carbonization process, using melamine-trithiocyanuric acid (MTCA) aggregates as both the N and S element sources. Noteworthy, MTCA also favored the formation of Ni nanowire via vapor liquid-solid mechanism, while Ni nanoparticles loaded CNFs (Ni/CNFs) was obtained without MTCA. For UOR tests, a high peak current intensity of 37.0 mA mg(-1) was obtained on Ni/N,S-CNFs at 0.42 V (vs. SCE), 2-times higher of that on Ni/CNFs. Besides, the catalytic stability of Ni/ N,S-CNFs was also improved. The enhanced catalytic properties of Ni/N,S-CNFs for UOR were ascribed to its unique Ni nanowires structure as well as the N, S dual-doping.

Ni3S2 has favorably metallic property due to the short Ni - Ni bonds in its structure and the most abundant nickel content in the stoichiometric formula among nickel sulfides, thus it is considered an effective electrocatalyst for urea oxidation. However, the current Ni3S2 based catalysts usually derived from toxic sulfur sources, posing safety concerns in production. Herein, we reveal Ni3S2 nanoparticles (ca. 10 nm) can be directly deposited onto Ni substrate in a facile hydrothermal reaction from nontoxic L-cysteine sulfur source without any additives. Ni3S2 serves as a highly efficient and reliable electrocatalyst for urea oxidation with high current responses, low Tafel slope, and reduced resistance. Moreover, the apparent activation energy of urea oxidation for the prepared Ni3S2 electrocatalyst is evaluated as 3.2 kJ mol 1, which is much lower than that of Ni(OH)(2) (15.7 kJ mol(-1)). As a result, the obtained Ni3S2 demonstrates remarkable catalytic activity of 280.2 A g(-1) outperforming the Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalyst (61.1 A g(-1)). In addition, Ni3S2 exhibits reliable catalytic performance, as examined by chronoamperometric, chronopotentiometric, and multi-current steps analyses.

However, there remains a pressing need for an efficient electrocatalyst to enhance the activity and stability of electrolytic urea. In this study, we employed the hydrothermal technique followed by a reduction-impregnation treatment to load the precious metal Rh on the porous LaNiO3 nanocubes. The Rh/LaNiO3-400 degrees C nanocubes prepared by this method not only retained the porous structure of the LaNiO3 nanocubes but also enhanced the catalytic properties of the precious metal. The synergistic effect between these Rh and LaNiO3 significantly boosted the efficiency of the electrolytic urea process. Characterization tests confirmed that Rh nanoparticles were successfully loaded into the porous LaNiO3 nanocubes, facilitating better interaction between the catalyst and the electrolyte. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the stability of Rh/LaNiO3-400 degrees C for up to 72 h. This remarkable stability suggests that such a robust electrocatalyst has the potential to serve as a cornerstone for efficient and long-lasting hydrogen production.

Herein, theoretical calculations predict that alpha-FeOOH enables a decline in formation energy and an improvement in stabilization of NiOOH in NiFe-based layered double hydroxide (LDH). Inspiringly, a composite composed of alpha-FeOOH and LDH is well-designed and successfully fabricated in hydrothermal treatment by adding extra Fe3+ resource, and stable NiOOH is obtained by the following electro-oxidation method. Benefiting from strong electron-capturing capability of alpha-FeOOH, it efficiently promotes charge redistribution around the Ni/Fe sites and activates Ni atoms of LDH, verified by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectra (XAS). The d-band center is optimized that balances the absorption and desorption energy, and thus Gibbs free energy barrier is lowered dramatically toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and finally showing an outstanding overpotential of 195 mV and a potential of 1.35 V at 10 mA cm(-)(2), respectively. This study provides a novel strategy to construct highly efficient catalysts via the introduction of a new phase for complex multiple-electron reactions.

For the rational engineering, the Se layers are initially deposited on the Ni foam substrate; then we grow Fe(OH)(2) hetero-nanostructures with various morphologies by introducing different ratios of Fe precursor sample. The Fe(OH)(2) ball-like nanorods to rock-like nanosheets are synthesized on the Se layered Ni foam surface by a simple hydrothermal process. The microscopic characterizations, and spectral analysis reveal the formation of Se integrated Fe(OH)(2) hetero-nanostructures such as ball-like nanorods, sprouts-like nanowire network, nanoflowers and rock-like nanosheets through effective Ni-O bond and Fe-Se bond for its typical synergism. The Se induces an interesting morphology transformation from crystalline nanorods to rock-like nanosheets structures that lead to the potential constituents for catalyst electrode that effectively merge the qualities such as high conductivity, large specific surface area, and larger catalytic active sites for electro-oxidation reaction of urea. Among them, NiF-Se@Fe(OH)(2) (8 mmol Fe(NO3)(2)) sprouts-like hetero-nanostructured network displays higher catalytic activity toward oxidation of urea (146.7 mA) with onset potential of 0.11 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M NaOH + 0.1 M urea. Furthermore, the sprouts-like NiF-Se@Fe(OH)(2) nanowired network shows superior activity than the other aspect ratio's, excellent long-term stability, and reproducibility.

Particularly, high-performance bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) provide a distinct avenue for simultaneously achieving the energy-saving hydrogen production and urea-containing wastewater degradation. Over the past decade, various materials engineering strategies have been developed to improve catalytic performance in terms of activity and stability. However, the mechanisms of reported bifunctional catalysts vary depending on the types of materials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest development of bifunctional electrocatalysts toward the OER/UOR, including candidates like oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphides, and metal-organic frameworks. A special focus is given on the in-depth understanding of the related reaction mechanisms to further enhance the bifunctional performance. Perspectives on future research directions are also discussed, including exploring new materials, avoiding the competition between the OER and UOR, tuning the selectivity, and enabling larger-scale applications of bifunctional OER/UOR electrocatalysts.

In this work, we have deposited Ni(OH)2 at various time spans of 1, 3 and 5 h over alkali-etched ZIF-67 via facile strategy. The optimum Ni(OH)2@etched ZIF-67 (5 h) (NEZ-3) heterostructure demonstrates excellent OER and UOR performance with a lower overpotential of 240 mV and 1.32 V, respectively at 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, the NEZ-3 electrocatalyst attains smaller Tafel values of 106 and 35 mV dec- 1 with remarkable stability of 60 and 48 h for OER/UOR performance at 10 mA cm-2. Specifically, the two-cell electrolyzer requires a lower cell voltage of 1.73 V (OER) and 1.48 V (UOR) with an excellent durability of 20 h at 10 mA cm-2, respectively. Additionally, the water displacement method is used to examine the 4-electron transfer process (OER) of NEZ-3 electrocatalyst with a Faradaic efficiency of 87.53 %. Notably, the porous structure, introduction of oxygen defects (Ov), higher oxidation state of Ni3+, and abundant active sites in NEZ-3 electrocatalyst are the foremost reasons for the superior electrocatalytic water and urea oxidation reactions. Therefore, this research work delivers a simple methodology in emerging a highly active, stable, and cost-effective multifunctional electrocatalysts towards energy conversion applications.

However, the sluggish kinetics of UOR which involves 6-electron transfer process has impeded its widespread applications. Hence, the development of efficient electro-catalysts is vital for the application of UOR and considerable progress has recently been reported. Among the various UOR catalysts, Ni-based catalysts have been widely studied due to their high UOR activity, abundant resources and long-term sustainability. Their high activity seems to be derived from the surface transformation behavior it undergoes during UOR. The surface transformation behavior results in some intermediates which are the real active sites in the reaction. Further investigation of the surface transformation behavior of Ni-based catalysts is critical and prerequisite for unraveling the underlying UOR mechanisms. Some advanced in situ characterization techniques should be combined during investigation. In this way, some effective methods for synthesis and modification of Ni-based catalysts can be proposed to boost UOR. In this review, we make a compressive summary of the widely accepted UOR mechanisms and the application of several key in situ characterization techniques in revealing surface transformation behavior and reaction mechanism of UOR. Recent advances of Ni-based electro-catalysts were discussed, especially in the methods of improving their UOR performance. We also propose some challenges and prospects for the future development of advanced characterization technologies and corresponding Ni-based catalysts in UOR.

To date, expensive electrode materials and time-consuming synthesis procedures have generally been used for the electrocatalysts applied in water splitting, which limits their efficiency. Herein, nickel-iron oxyhydroxide nanosheets are fabricated by a scalable and ultrafast (requiring only 5 s) wet chemical strategy on a nickel foam substrate. The experimental results indicate that compared to recently reported catalysts, the prepared nickel-iron oxyhydroxide electrode has a high number of active sites and low reaction barrier, enabling efficient OER catalysis in an alkaline electrolyte. In particular, the prepared nickel-iron oxyhydroxide electrode requires an ultralow overpotential of 230 mV to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), with excellent long-term stability for 75 h. Moreover, the nickeliron oxyhydroxide also performs well towards the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UEOR), with a very low potential of 1.38 and 1.41 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) to reach 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea electrolyte. This ultrafast synthesis approach can be extended to prepare electrocatalysts used for other electrochemical reactions. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report a crystalline nickel-cobalt phosphides/amorphous phosphorous -incorporated manganese oxides composite (c-CoNiPx/a-P-MnOy) with a hierarchical structure as an efficient, durable, and multifunctional catalyst for both UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. The c-CoNiPx/a-P-MnOy electrode shows excellent UOR activity (by indirect mechanism) with the low potentials of 1.24 and 1.35 V at 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, long-term stability (300 h), and excellent HER per-formance with a hydrogen production rate of 0.18 mmol h-1 and an average Faraday efficiency (FE) of 97.2 % at 20 mA cm-2 and high stability at 50 mA cm-2 as assisted by UOR. The outstanding catalytic performance is attributed to that: (1) the Co-incorporation into NiPx system lowers the oxidation potential of Ni2+ to Ni3+, leading to the enrichment of UOR-oriented active component (NiOOH) on the surface of the electrode; (2) CoNiPx with excellent electrical conductivity and electron-transfer ability serves as the active phase for HER; and (3) the unique configuration of a-P-MnOy and c-CoNiPx not only boosts the adsorption of reactant molecules to enhance the activity, but also enables long-term stabilities towards UOR and HER. This work highlights that the crystalline/amorphous configuration and the Mn/Co-incorporation greatly optimize the catalytic activity and stability towards both UOR and HER, which opens a new avenue to develop high-performance catalysts for the energy-saving hydrogen production.

The hydrogels were structurally and chemically characterized and their swelling behavior was evaluated in water, NaCl and buffer solutions at different pHs.

This percentage of swelling is significantly higher in grafted films than in the oxidized chitosans. Besides, the ability as fertilizers and water controlled-release superabsorbent hydrogels was evaluated. Consequently, the absorption and delivery of urea fertilizer was investigated as a function of initial concentration of urea in the media and the pH.

However, the impact of grain boundary corrosion on the structure and electrochemical performance of alloy is still unknown. Herein, the vacuum arc-melted CrCoNiFe alloys with interlaced network structures via grain boundary corrosion methods were fabricated. The grain boundaries that existed as defects were severely corroded and an interlaced network structure was formed, promoting the exposure of the active site and the release of gas bubbles. Besides, the (oxy)hydroxides layer (25 nm) on the surface could act as the true active center and improve the surface wettability. Benefiting from the unique structure and constructed surface, the CrCoNiFe-12 affords a high urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance with the lowest overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH adding 0.33 M urea. The CrCoNiFe-12||Pt only required a cell voltage of 1.485 V to afford 10 mA/cm2 for UOR and long-term stability of 100 h at 10 mA/cm2 (27.6 mV decrease). These findings offer a facile strategy for designing bulk multiple-principal-element alloy electrodes for energy conversion.

Nano-Sheets of CsNiVF6 Pyrochlore Electrocatalyst for Enhanced Urea Oxidation and Hydrogen Green Production Reactions	CATALYSTS												This study presents the successful synthesis of a cesium-nickel-vanadium fluoride (CsNiVF6) pyrochlore nano-sheet catalyst via solid-phase synthesis and its electrochemical performance in green hydrogen production through urea electrolysis in alkaline media. The physicochemical characterizations revealed that the CsNiVF6 exhibits a pyrochlore-type structure consisting of a disordered cubic corner-shared (Ni, V)F6 octahedra structure and nano-sheet morphology with a thickness ranging from 10 to 20 nm. Using the CsNiVF6 catalyst, the electrochemical analysis, conducted through cyclic voltammetry, demonstrates a current mass activity of similar to 1500 mA mg(-1), recorded at 1.8 V vs. RHE, along with low-resistance (3.25 ohm) charge transfer and good long-term stability for 0.33 M urea oxidation in an alkaline solution. Moreover, the volumetric hydrogen production rate at the cathode (bare nickel foam) is increased from 12.25 to 39.15 mu mol/min upon the addition of 0.33 M urea to a 1.0 KOH solution and at a bias potential of 2.0 V. The addition of urea to the electrolyte solution enhances hydrogen production at the cathode, especially at lower voltages, surpassing the volumes produced in pure 1.0 M KOH solution. This utilization of a CsNiVF6 pyrochlore nano-sheet catalyst and renewable urea as a feedstock contributes to the development of a green and sustainable hydrogen economy. Overall, this research underscores the potential use of CsNiVF6 as a cost-effective nickel-based pyrochlore electrocatalyst for advancing renewable and sustainable urea electrolysis processes toward green hydrogen production.

Herein, a Ni3N (110)/Ni3S2 (010) heterointerface was fabricated. The electronic interactions between the two phases generates an accumulated charge density heterointerface and endows the heterointerface with more enhanced density of states, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of more UOR intermediates, thus lowering the theoretical reaction barrier for the rate-controlling step of *CONHN to *CONN. The nickel moieties on Ni3N side tends to bond carbonyl and the nickel moieties on Ni3S2 side preferentially bond amnio. The cooperation of both nickel moieties contributes to the superb intrinsic UOR activity of Ni3N (110)/Ni3S2 (010) heterointerface. As a consequence, Ni3N (110)/Ni3S2 (010) heterointerface showcases outstanding UOR activity, reaching 105.66 mA.cm(-2) at 1.6 V. This work provides an excellent UOR catalyst and helps to better understand the cooperation mechanism of the active sites at the heterointerface.					peike, wang/HRD-0257-2023; Ren, Zhongqi/HCI-4897-2022; Wei, Jun/K-3584-2015; liu, haipeng/AAE-6689-2022	Zhongqi, Ren/0000-0002-8910-5743													1385-8947	1873-3212				JUL 1	2024	491								152160	10.1016/j.cej.2024.152160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.152160		MAY 2024											WOS:001240927000001

Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show the NiHPO4-Ni(OH)(2) bouquets form through the organization of nanowires which arrange with certain direction. The electrocatalytic activities of NiHPO4-Ni(OH)(2)-GCE towards the oxidation of methanol and urea were studied in NaOH. The nanowire-assembled bouquets were modified on the surface of the glassy carbon electrode, leading to the increase on the surface area of the electrode, which in turn enhanced the current density and electrocatalytic performance for the oxidation of methanol and urea.

Herein, CuNiCo-7.8 %Mo/CF (7.8 % is the Mo atom percentage; CF: copper foam) medium entropy alloy catalyst with moderate local lattice tensile strain and built-in electric field is prepared by solvothermal and calcination methods to obtain the good UOR performance. Besides, the operando electrochemical impedance and quasi-operando Raman spectroscopy proved that CuNiCo-7.8 %Mo/CF can favor the direct oxidation reaction in a solution of 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea. The electrochemical results show that CuNiCo-7.8 %Mo/CF has a better UOR activity (E10/500/1000 = 1.27/1.44/ 1.51 V) than other studied samples during the UOR process. Meanwhile, CuNiCo-7.8 %Mo/CF can stably work for 100 h at 1000 mA cm- 2. Therefore, a CuNiCo-7.8 %Mo/CF material is designed for high-efficiency UOR at large current density and it is provided as a feasible method for large-scale treating urea-rich wastewater.

It's expected that rGO with high specific surface area provides superior catalytic performance for MCNS/rGO than MCNS. Also, the synergic effect of Mo, NI, and Co in the composite accelerates the urea oxidation and enhances the performance of the catalyst. The composites were characterized by field emission electron microscopy, transition electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties of composites were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. The MCNS/rGO demonstrated superior electrocatalytic performance than the MCNS catalyst. The incorporating of rGO into MCNS creates a high electrochemical surface area for urea electro-oxidation that resulted in a higher current density (18 mA cm(-2)) than MCNS (3.7 mA cm(-2)) at the presence of 0.6M urea and the scan rate of 20mVs(-1). The maximum current density obtained 43 mA cm(-2) for MCNS/rGO at the scan rate of 70 mV s(-1) In room temperature. Also, single cells based on MCNS and MCNS/rGO supplied a maximum power density of 7.7 mW cm(-2) and 21.0 mW cm(-2) at room temperature, respectively. Hence, MCNS/rGO can be a favorable electrocatalyst for application in the direct urea fuel cell.

However, an insufficient mechanistic understanding and the lack of efficient catalysts for the urea oxidation reaction have hampered the development of such applications. Here we demonstrate that a nickel ferrocyanide (Ni2Fe(CN)(6)) catalyst supported on Ni foam can drive the urea oxidation reaction with a higher activity and better stability than those of conventional Ni-based catalysts. Our experimental and computational data suggest a urea oxidation reaction pathway different from most other Ni-based catalysts that comprise NiOOH derivatives as the catalytically active compound. Ni2Fe(CN)(6) appears to be able to directly facilitate a two-stage reaction pathway that involves an intermediate ammonia production (on the Ni site) and its decomposition to N-2 (on the Fe site). Owing to the different rate-determining steps with more favourable thermal/kinetic energetics, Ni2Fe(CN)(6) achieves a 100 mA cm(-2) anodic current density at a potential of 1.35 V (equal to an overpotential of 0.98 V). Urea oxidation could be a lower-energy alternative to water oxidation in hydrogen-producing electrolysers, but improved catalysts are required to facilitate the reaction. Geng et al. report nickel ferrocyanide as a promising catalyst and suggest that it operates via a different pathway to that of previous materials.

Exploring the real active species in the urea electro-oxidation process is of great significance for understanding the urea electro-oxidation mechanism and designing catalysts. A highly active and stable Prussian blue analogue catalyst (PBA@NiFe/NF) loaded on nickel foam was synthesized for electro-oxidation of urea. In situ Raman spectra revealed that Ni in PBA@NiFe/NF was able to maintain a stable divalent nickel (Ni(II)) state for up to 3.5 h during the initial urea oxidation process, which is rarely reported in previous research studies. In addition, with the participation of iron, the Ni-Fe bimetallic center significantly improves the electro-oxidation of urea.

Herein, the FeCo/CoFe2O4 nanoflowers are successfully embedded in N-doped graphitic carbon (NGC) by hydrothermal method and subsequently annealing process (FeCo/CoFe2O4 @NGC). It only needs 1.47 V and 1.32 V for OER and UOR to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, it can work continuously for 100 h at different current densities (10; similar to 1000 mA cm(-2)), displays outstanding stability, which is mainly ascribed to the N-doped carbon encapsulated FeCo modified CoFe2O4 heterostructure and porous structure. This study thus provides a simple synthesis method to design and manufacture low-cost and highperformance catalytic materials for OER and UOR, and promotes the industrial application of water splitting.

Nickel oxide nanoparticles grown on mesoporous carbon as an efficient electrocatalyst for urea electro-oxidation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Nickel oxide nanoparticles were formed on mesoporous carbon (NiO/MC) through precipitating nickel hydroxide species followed by post annealing treatment. The as-prepared electrocatalysts were physically characterized using XRD, Raman, EDX, SEM, TEM and HRTEM analysis techniques. Very fine nanoparticles were shown in TEM image and their chemical identity was proved in XRD pattern by three crystal indices of nickel oxide species as (111), (200) and (220). The electrocatalytic activity of NiO/MC electrocatalysts was investigated for oxidizing urea molecules in 0.5 M NaOH solution. Adding variable nickel oxide loading values during the electrocatalyst preparation method appreciably affected the obtained oxidation current density. Increasing the deposited oxide weight percentage would enhance the activity of formed nanocomposite to attain its optimum performance at the electrocatalyst containing 17.5 wt% NiO. The effect of altering urea concentration and scan rate during the oxidation process on the resultant electrocatalyst activity was studied. Chronoamperograms displayed improved steady state oxidation current density values after 1800 s revealing stable nanocatalysts. This promising electrocatalytic behavior of NiO/MC elects its application as an active component for urea electro-oxidation in many potential applications including hydrogen production, fuel cells and water purification.

Urea sensing is a crucial technology for the life quality of people facing kidney disease. Through the quantification of urea in saliva, the monitoring of the progress of kidney disease could be enabled. [Ni3(HHTP)2]n can detect urea via urea electro-oxidation reaction. The urea electro-oxidation on [Ni3(HHTP)2]n follows an EC' mechanism. [Ni3(HHTP)2]n is electrochemically transformed into Ni(OH)2, the catalytic intermediate of Ni in alkaline electrolyte, and the reduction step of Ni3+ to Ni2+ limited by the urea electro-oxidation reaction. The transformation leads to a disintegration of the metal-organic framework due to oxygen evolution. As urea inhibits oxygen evolution, the degradation is also inhibited. Our results demonstrated a competitive sensor when compared to the benchmarking, with a sensitivity of 1.797 mA/cm2 center dot mM Urea, the limit of detection of 3.5 mu M, linear range between 0.01 mM and 1 mM with a correlation coefficient of 0.991 and selectivity towards Na+, K+, Cl , creatinine, uric acid, and low concentrations of glucose.

However, the conventional unidirectional gas phase co-reduction techniques typically employes pose stringent demands for the design of key catalysts, reaction control, mass transfer, and other aspects, due to the disparity in physical properties, structure, and catalytic kinetics between N-2 and CO2. Herein, Ru-TiO2 is synthesized and employed as an effective catalyst for urea photo-synthesis through a nitric acid-mediated pathway combining nitrogen oxidation and subsequent kinetically advantageous nitrate and CO2 co-reduction. A urea yield of 24.95 mu mol h(-1) g(cat)(-1). is obtained through an innovative intermittent illumination method, AQE values of 4.7% and 6.3% at 380 and 420 nm, respectively. The remarkable photo-activity is attributed to its unique oxygen vacancy-anchored Ru nanostructure (Ru-O4Ti1), which effectively activates inert N-2 molecules to minish the disparity of orbital energy levels, facilitates the formation of crucial *NN(OH) intermediates, and serves as an "electronic pump" to avoid electronegativity effect for facilitating electron transfer from nitrogen to TiO2 support for urea photosynthesis.

J	Rasal, AS; Chen, HM; Yu, WY				Rasal, Akash S.; Chen, Hao Ming; Yu, Wen-Yueh			Electronic structure engineering of electrocatalyst for efficient urea oxidation reaction	NANO ENERGY												Urea electrolysis is a viable approach to produce hydrogen energy, while the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) presents major obstacles due to its low conversion efficiency and high kinetic barriers. To achieve the full potential of UOR, engineering the electronic structure of UOR electrocatalysts is expected not only to realize highvalence active centers but also to improve the electrical conductivity, thus boosting the overall catalytic efficacies. Furthermore, electronic structure engineering holds promise for facilitating the interface-driven electron transfer, fine-tuning the binding strength of essential reaction intermediates (e.g., NH*, and CO*), and enabling the COO* desorption step in the reaction pathway. In order to construct electronic modulation of electrocatalysts, it is crucial to comprehend how electronic structure engineering impacts UOR activity and what guidelines should be followed. In this review, we begin with an overview of the key differences between water electrolysis and urea electrolysis, then go over the activity parameters used to evaluate the catalytic efficacies that could be expected to help readers to gain a fundamental understanding of this field. This will be followed by outlining the first principles and key parameters of catalyst electronic structure engineering for the benefit of the reader. Furthermore, detailed notes were provided on the potential of electronic structure-engineered catalysts to speed up the UOR kinetics with a focus on interface engineering, doping engineering, defect engineering, phase engineering, and strain engineering. Finally, we discuss the difficulties and opportunities that lie beneath the prospect of developing electrocatalysts for UOR that are both efficient and effective in the future.

A three-electrode system is commonly used to measure electrocatalytic performance for UOR catalysts before further investigation in a full cell configuration. However, the influence of the ink composition and catalyst loading and the role of the ionomer in the catalyst layer for UOR in a three-electrode system have not been studied before. In this study, we have studied the influence of Nafion ionomer in Ni/C catalyst ink, the catalyst loading on the glassy carbon electrode surface, and KOH and urea concentrations on UOR activity systematically. A standard preparation method and a benchmark protocol were proposed to obtain reliable UOR catalyst performance using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance tests. In addition, the catalyst ink quality was assessed by partide size distribution and zeta potential using the dynamic light scattering technique. The mass activity and transport resistance were found to be the optimum condition at a catalyst loading of 0.1 mg cm(-2) with a ionomer-to-catalyst (I/C) ratio of 1. Further, the urea concentration of 0.33 M in 3 M KOH also exhibits the best UOR activity. Lastly, the Butler-Volmer kinetic analysis was used for the first time to investigate the effect of the I/C ratio and catalyst loading on UOR with rotating ring-disk voltammetry results. The presence of Nafion ionomer and an optimum catalyst loading improve the water uptake in the catalyst layer, which leads to an enhanced OH- and urea transport within the catalyst layer. The findings of this study provide insights into designing and evaluating UOR catalysts for advancing the urea electrolysis technology.

However, the energy efficiency is mainly restricted by the sluggish urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this study, we report a temple-assisted approach for the synthesis of Zn doped based-Co nanoarray catalysts for urea electrolysis. The nanoarray structure and Zn doping enlarge the exposure of the active sites and tune the electronic configuration of based-Co catalysts, favoring the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR. Specifically, Zn-CoSe2 cathode presents a relatively low overpotential (200 mV) and a desirable Faradaic efficiency (97.2 %) of HER to support the current density of 100 mA<middle dot>cm(-2) in alkaline solution. When the Zn-CoP anode is utilized for the UOR, a potential of 1.3 V is required to drive a current density of 50 mA<middle dot>cm(-2) in a urea-alkaline solution. In-situ Raman unveiled that the Se sites are identified as the H-2-evolving center while the Co site was responsible for dissociating H2O. Further operando characterization indicated that a shortened oxidation pathway, characterized by low Co3+ generation, accounts for the efficient degradation of urea., which is obviously distinguished from the four-electron-transfer pathway of OER with higher Co4+. This work exhibits significant potential for removing urea coupled with economical and sustainable H-2 production.					ma, yue/GXE-9897-2022; Lin, Tao/B-7256-2009	Gao, Li/0000-0001-5827-5814													1383-5866	1873-3794				MAR 1	2025	355		A						129438	10.1016/j.seppur.2024.129438	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.129438		SEP 2024											WOS:001314973100001

Structure engineering is an efficient approach to tailoring the quantities of active sites. Herein, ultrafine-grained NiCo LDH nanosheets with partial exfoliation are synthesized by transforming unstable EDTA-intercalated NiCo LDH into stable NiCo-CO32- LDH in 1.0 M KOH. The structure-engineered NiCo LDH nanosheets are nearvertically aligned and thus expose numerous accessible crystal edge sites on the basal plane and edge sites for UOR. In addition, the incorporation of Co helps improve the conductivity and promote the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox reaction. The catalyst materials thus deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 0.341 V vs Hg/HgO, showing a reduction of 123 and >= 61 mV in overpotential relative to the nickel hydroxide and common NiCo LDH, respectively. The relationship between the electrochemical properties and the structure was comprehensively studied and revealed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, urea electrooxidation reaction still suffered from the sluggish kinetics owing to a 6e(-) transfer processes involvement. In this work, nanoporous carbon nanosheets (C-ps) derived from peanut shells (PS) were synthesized via two pyrolysis steps along with KOH activation. NiMoO4 nanoparticles were then embedded in C-ps via a facile impregnation method. The as-prepared catalyst possessed large surface area and the embedded NiMoO4 nanoparticles exhibited small size with average diameter of 10 nm. The chemical properties of NiMoO4 could be also tuned after embedded in C-ps. When used as catalyst for urea electrooxidation reaction, NiMoO4 embedded in C-ps exhibited superior catalytic performance. NiMoO4 nanoparticles with small size could expose more active sites, the interface interaction between NiMoO4 and C-ps could promote charge transfer and the existence of Mo species could improve the stability of the catalyst. Therefore, the as-prepared NiMoO4 embedded in C-ps should be a promising catalyst in wastewater treatment and energy storage.																			0927-7757	1873-4359				NOV 5	2020	604								125276	10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.125276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.125276													WOS:000573286300011

An innovative catalyst of PdNiP nanosphere deposited PEDOT:PSS/rGO hybrid material as an efficient electrocatalyst for alkaline urea oxidation	POLYMER BULLETIN												Efficient and low-cost materials to generate electrical energy from small organic materials are highly demanded for a large-scale commercialization of direct urea fuel cells. The purpose of this work is to improve the electrochemical performance of nickel phosphide (Ni) through palladium (Pd) doping via the facile solvothermal method and dispersing the obtained palladium nickel phosphide (PdNiP) on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate)/reduced graphene oxide (PEDOT:PSS/rGO) support material via a simple ultrasonic process. The electrochemical activities of Pd doped NiP and PdNiP@PEDOT:PSS/rGO electrodes toward urea electrooxidation were tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV test reveals the significant efficiency improvement in nickel phosphide (NiP) upon Pd doping, and further improvement was achieved when obtained PdNiP dispersed on PEDOT:PSS/rGO toward alkaline urea oxidation. Since PdNiP@PEDOT:PSS/rGO remarkably outperformed NiP and PdNiP, it is a promising novel material for alkaline urea oxidation in a direct urea fuel cell.

The electrochemical desalination cell (EDC) utilized the potential difference and concentration gradient between three chosen waste streams to convert their inherent chemical energy into electrical energy. Urea/cow urine was chosen as a potential electron donor, Cr(VI) was an electron acceptor, and synthetic NaCl/ seawater solution (in the middle chamber) established a three-compartment EDC. The effect of a wide range of brine (5 to 35 g/L) and Cr(VI) concentrations (200 to 1000 mg/L) on desalination performance and Cr(VI) reduction were comprehensively investigated. When fed with urea, Cr(VI) reduction of 96.2 +/- 0.4 % (with an initial concentration of 1000 mg/L) and salt removal of 63.1 +/- 0.2 % (with brine concentration of 35 g/L) were observed (in 4 h) with a maximum power of 15.2 mW (for 21 cm2 electrode). A 12 L benchtop prototype with six anode-cathode configurations was demonstrated. Cr(VI) reduction of 95.2 +/- 2 % and desalination of 70.7 +/- 0.2 % (in 20 h) with power generation of 55.2 mW was recorded. The economic analysis projection of the EDC presents a significant step toward the application of this technology in real systems.

This operation, implemented at room temperature, allows, in addition to the depolluting action, the generation of hydrogen at the cathode. Using inexpensive electrodes and photo-assisting the process, this method has potential for industrial application. This review delves into the recent advancements in the electrochemical treatment of urea and ammonia from urine, understanding and optimizing the electrolysis process under various conditions. Notably, the electrolysis of urea and ammonia in alkaline medium over nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) catalyst, has emerged as a promising avenue, offering enhanced selectivity and efficiency. The exploration extends to urine management, urea degradation, catalyst deactivation, reaction selectivity, and the detection of reaction products, as well as photoelectrochemical processes in a future reactor perspective, where the synergistic combination of photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation opens new pathways for urine valorization.

Highly efficient and affordable electrocatalysts are indispensable for realizing the great potential of this emerging technology. Among the numerous candidates, alpha-Ni(OH)(2) has the merits of good electrocatalytic activity, adjustable heteroelement doping, and low cost; consequently, it has received tremendous attention in the electrolytic fields. Herein, a Y3+-doping strategy is developed to effectively enhance the catalytic performance of nickel hydroxide in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Our results show that Y3+ incorporation successfully modulates the electronic structure of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) by inducing Ni3+ formation in the crystal lattice to initiate direct UOR, facilitates the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox transition with higher current responses to promote indirect UOR, and maintains the structural stability of YNi-10 (Ni2+/Y3+ molar ratio = 1:0.1) during long-term UOR operation. Owing to these features, the obtained YNi-10 sample exhibits a higher current density (127 vs 79 mA cm(-2) at 1.5 V), a lower Tafel slope (48 vs 75 mV dec(-1)), a larger potential difference between the UOR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 0.26 vs 0.22 V at 80 mA cm(-2)), a higher reaction rate constant (1.1 x 10(5) vs 3.1 x 10(3) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)), and a reduced activation energy of UOR (2.9 vs 14.8 kJ mol(-1)) compared with the Y-free counterpart (YNi-0). This study presents a promising strategy to simultaneously boost direct and indirect UORs, providing new insights for further developing high-performance electrocatalysts.

To maximize this purpose, design of catalysts for selective urea-to-nitrite (NO2-) electrooxidation with increased electron transfer and high current is practically important. Herein, a cobalt, germanium (Co, Ge) co-doped nickel (Ni) oxyhydroxide catalyst is reported first time that directs urea-to-NO2- conversion with a significant Faradaic efficiency of 84.9% at 1.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and significantly boosts UOR activity to 448.0 mA cm(-2). Importantly, this performance is greater than for most reported Ni-based catalysts. Based on judiciously combined synchrotron-based measurement, in situ spectroscopy and density functional theoretical computation, significantly boosted urea-to-NO2- production results from Co, Ge co-doping is demonstrated that optimizes electronic structure of Ni sites in which urea adsorption is altered as NO-terminal configuration to facilitate C-N cleavage for *NH formation, and thereby expedites pathway for urea to NO2- conversion. Findings highlight the importance of tuning intermediate adsorption behavior for design of high-performance UOR electrocatalysts, and will be of practical benefit to a range of researchers and manufacturers in replacing conventional water electrooxidation with UOR for energy-saving H-2 production.

Among the studied catalysts, Ni-MnO2/TiO2 exhibits reasonable electrocatalytic activity towards UOR (1.29 V vs Ag/AgCl satd. KCl is required to achieve 10 mAcm-2 current density). Improved interfacing of nickel with tubular-like MnO2 and presence of TiO2 with MnO2 all together contributed for the observed higher UOR catalytic activity.

In this work, the introduction of exogenous modifier Ni-MOF improved the reaction kinetics and morphology of the NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF catalyst. Asobtained NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF has excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance. The catalyst need overpotential of 340 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm-2 for OER and a potential of 1.31 V at the same current density for UOR. The Tafel slopes of NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF is 38.34 and 15.33 mV dec-1 for OER and UOR respectively, which is more superior than 78.58 and 66.73 mV dec-1 of NiCo2O4/NF. The nanosheets microstructure is beneficial to the adsorption and transport of electrolyte and the presence of a large number of mesoporous channels can also accelerate gas release, and then improves activity of the catalyst. Density functional theory calculation demonstrate that NiCo2O4 plays a role in absorbing water, while the existence of in situ generated NiOOH can promote the electron transfer efficiency. It is synergies of NiCo2O4 and in situ generated NiOOH that enhance the decomposition of water on the surface of the NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF.

Herein, we develop a novel H2O2 treatment strategy for tailoring the surface oxygen ligand of NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH). The sample after H2O2 treatment (NiFeO-LDH) shows significant enhancement on UOR efficiency, with the potential of 1.37 V (RHE) to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The boost is attributed to the richness adsorption O ligand on NiFeO-LDH as revealed by XPS and Raman analysis. DFT calculation indicates formation of two possible types of oxygen ligands: adsorbed oxygen on the surface and ex-posed from hydroxyl group, lowered the desorption energy of CO2 product, which lead to the lowered onset potential. This strategy is further extended to NiFe-LDH nano sheet on Ni foam to reach a higher current density of 440 mA/cm2 of UOR at 1.8 V (RHE). The facile sur-face O ligand manipulation is also expected to give chance to many other electro-catalytic oxidations.(c) 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, to inhibit the over-oxidation of urea brought by the high valence state of Ni, tremendous efforts are devoted to obtaining low-value products of nitrogen gas to avoid toxic nitrite formation, undesirably causing inefficient utilization of the nitrogen cycle. Herein, we proposed a mediation engineering strategy to significantly boost high-value nitrite formation to help close a loop for the employment of a nitrogen economy. Specifically, platinum-loaded nickel phosphides (Pt-Ni2P) catalysts exhibit a promising nitrite production rate (0.82 mol kWh-1 cm-2), high stability over 66 h of Zn-urea-air battery operation, and 135 h of co-production of nitrite and hydrogen under 200 mA cm-2 in a zero-gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system. The in situ spectroscopic characterizations and computational calculations demonstrated that the urea oxidation kinetics is facilitated by enriched dynamic Ni3+ active sites, thus augmenting the "cyanate" UOR pathway.

In this study, the vanadium (V) and cerium (Ce) co-doped FeCoNi medium-entropy phosphide (VCe-FeCoNiP/NF) were effectively fabricated on nickel foam (NF) via "two-step method," which involved hydrothermal treatment followed by phosphorization. Experimental results indicate that, benefiting from dual-ion doping and medium-entropy configuration, VCe-FeCoNiP/NF demonstrates unique electronic effects among the multimetallic elements, thereby exhibited remarkable catalytic activity for both urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Under urea-water conditions (1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea), the VCe-FeCoNi/NF catalyst merely required 1.338 V (vs RHE) and an overpotential of 173 mV to attain a current density of 100 mA<middle dot>cm(-2) for UOR and HER, respectively. Moreover, it could stably operate at a current density of 20 mA<middle dot>cm(-2) for 225 h in overall urea-water decomposition. This work provides new insights for designing high-performance urea-water electrolysis catalysts.

In this work, we propose a facile synthetic method for Co and N dual-doped Ni2P directly grown on Ni foam (Co-Ni2P-N/NF) using hydrothermal and annealing process. Simultaneous Co and N dual-doping into Ni2P not only modifies the surface electronic structure, but also generates a multitude of active sites with high valence states, which are beneficial for improving electrocatalytic kinetics for both OER and UOR. As a result, the Co-Ni2P-N/NF catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 329 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm-2 for OER in alkaline solution, which is much lower than that of the state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalyst. In addition, the urea-assisted water oxidation process exhibits a significant reduction of approximately 163 mV in the required potential at 100 mA cm-2 compared to that of the OER, which highlights the remarkable potential of the prepared Co-Ni2P-N/NF electrocatalyst in facilitating the purification of wastewater and hydrogen production with significantly lower energy consumption.																			0021-9797	1095-7103				NOV 15	2023	650		B				1851	1861		10.1016/j.jcis.2023.07.158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2023.07.158		JUL 2023						37515975					WOS:001051414200001

In this study, a simple and feasible thermal phosphorization strategy is explored to rationally construct Pdoped MoO2-NiMoO4 heterostructure on nickel foam (NF). The heterointerfaced P-MoO2-NiMoO4/NF can simultaneously realize the integrated all-in-one functionalities, innovatively introducing superwettable surfaces, photothermal conversion capabilities and electrocatalytic functions. The superwettability gives P-MoO2NiMoO4/NF sufficient electrolyte permeation and smooth bubble detachment. The plasmonic MoO2 with photothermal performance greatly elevates the local surface temperature of in P-MoO2-NiMoO4/NF, which is conducive to improve the electrocatalytic efficiency. The favorable in-situ surface reconstruction brings abundant active sites for electrocatalytic reactions. As an advanced multifunctional electrocatalyst, the superwettable and photothermal P-MoO2-NiMoO4/NF exhibits significantly improved performances in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). More importantly, the highly efficient and stable overall waterurea electrolysis assisted by photothermal fields can be simply achieved by exposing P-MoO2-NiMoO4/NF to near-infrared (NIR) light.

In response, a urea-assisted energy-saving alkaline hydrogen-production system has been investigated by replacing OER with a more oxidizable urea oxidation reaction (UOR). A bimetal heterostructure CoMn/CoMn2O4 as a bifunctional catalyst is constructed in an alkaline system for both urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on the Schottky heterojunction structure, CoMn/CoMn2O4 induces self-driven charge transfer at the interface, which facilitates the absorption of reactant molecules and the fracture of chemical bonds, therefore triggering the decomposition of water and urea. As a result, the heterostructured electrode exhibits ultralow potentials of -0.069 and 1.32 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and UOR, respectively, in alkaline solution, and the full urea electrolysis driven by CoMn/CoMn2O4 delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low potential of 1.51 V and performs stably for more than 15 h. This represents a novel strategy of Mott-Schottky hybrids in electrocatalysts and should inspire the development of sustainable energy conversion by combining hydrogen production and sewage treatment.

Herein, we realize the synthesis of a high-performance NiOOH-based catalyst through in-situ transformation from the NiMn-based metal-organic framework to NiMnOOH. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization shows that the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio in the NiMnOOH is 3.9 times as big as that in the Ni(OH)(2), and in-situ Raman characterization further consolidates the presence of the NiOOH species in the NiMnOOH and as well unveils the faciliated Ni2+/Ni3+ redox reaction. The abundant NiOOH species, the markedly facilitated Ni2+/Ni3+ redox reaction and the Ni-Mn synergy contribute to the high intrinsic activity of the NiMnOOH towards UOR. The NiMnOOH exhibits an impressively low onset potential of 1.305 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and requires only a small potential of 1.34 V vs RHE to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH + 0.33 M urea. In addition, the NiMnOOH catalyst possesses good long-term working stability. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The fabrication of the electrode was done using electrophoretic co-deposition combined with hydrothermal reaction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy were used to examine the electrode properties, while cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to study the electrode kinetics. The prepared catalyst that had a flake-like structure was an alpha phase Ni(OH)(2) catalyst, which mixed well with the CNTs to form a composite layer on the CF substrate. The alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/CNT/CF electrode displayed satisfactory UOR performance because it had a higher oxidation current and a lower overpotential than those of either the alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/CF electrode or CF electrode. These improved properties of the alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/CNT/CF electrode can be because of the active and reversible Ni2+/Ni3+ redox reaction, which has high rate constant and anodic transfer coefficient, of the alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/CNT composite. Moreover, compared with alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/CF or CF electrodes, the alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/CNT/ CF electrode has a low charge transfer resistance because of the increase in the reaction surface area and electrical conductivity caused by the CNTs. Overall, the composite electrode combines the advantages of the alpha-Ni (OH)(2) catalyst, CNT conductive network, and CF current collector for improved UOR performance, which will be beneficial for urea pollution mitigation and H-2 production.

Perspective of Use of Pd/rGO in a Direct Urea Microfluidic Fuel Cell	CATALYSTS												The urine/urea oxidation reaction through catalysts with a higher performance in direct urea microfluidic fuel cells (DU mu FC) is a promising method for power generation due to the large amount of human and animal urine containing 2-2.5 wt% urea. This paper presents a study that used urea as fuel in a DU mu FC in the presence of palladium supported by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for power generation. Some parameters, such as urea, KOH and H2SO4 concentration and flux rate, among others, are optimized in order to carry out the evaluation of urine samples as fuel in an air-breathing microfluidic fuel cell. The results show that the Pd/rGo catalyst mixed with Nafion (R) in the anodic compartment is dispersed and attached to the paper fibers, generating electrical contact and giving rise to the reactions of interest. In addition, XRD analysis confirmed the successful deposition of Pd and rGo on the substrate. These electrochemical results are promising, since, despite the decrease in the general performance of the DU mu FC under ideal conditions with respect to normal cells, the generation of energy from urine was demonstrated.					espinosa lagunes, fabiola ilian/P-9237-2016; Escalona-Villalpando, Ricardo/JAD-1379-2023; Gurrola, Mayra/GYU-8659-2022; Cruz, Julio/HKW-0397-2023; Escalona-Villalpando, Ricardo A./AAV-2919-2021	Cruz, Julio/0000-0001-8664-9422; Ledesma-Garcia, J./0000-0002-0677-4280; Escalona-Villalpando, Ricardo A./0000-0003-0707-040X; Gurrola, Mayra Polett/0000-0002-4060-3450														2073-4344				APR 22	2023	13	5							788	10.3390/catal13050788	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/catal13050788													WOS:000996630600001

Highly efficient and stable nonprecious metal electrocatalysts are desired to resolve the slow kinetics resulted from the six-electron transfer process inherent in UOR. Here, the heterostructured nanocrystals of Co2P-Ni3S2 were constructed through deposition of Ni salt on acetylene black coated with CoP species (Co2P-Ni3S2/C) and subsequent vulcanization. Compared with single component CoP/C and Ni3S2/C, the Co2P-Ni3S2/C with optimal ratio of Co2P and Ni3S2 shows lower potential (1.338 V) to reach 10 mA<middle dot>cm(-2), which also realizes good long-term stability for nearly 100 h in chronoamperometry test. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UOR results together revealed that Ni3+ is the main site to form active intermediates, which is formed by the electron transfer from Ni3S2 to Co2P through a heterostructured interface. Inspired by the excellent UOR activity of Co2P-Ni3S2/C, as an anode in electrolyte for hydrogen evolution through urea-assisted water splitting, the current density of 10 mA<middle dot>cm(-2) can be achieved at a potential of only 1.389 V. Therefore, the construction of two component heterostructure is conducive to electron transfer and active site regulation, so as to realize the development of effective UOR catalyst and promote the UOR application for energy-saving hydrogen production.

However, problems such as high energy consumption and slow urea oxidation kinetics have hindered its rapid development. In this study, a series of foreign element modified NiCoP-based catalysts were in-situ grown on Ni foam through hydrothermal process, solvothermal method and low temperature phosphating method. The morphology of the electrode was regulated by changing the impregnation elements. It was found that Mo3P@NiCoP/NF has rich active sites and small impedance, which makes it have excellent urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) property. At a current density of 10 mA cm -2, the potential of UOR is 1.206 V, and the overpotential of HER is 90 mV. The assembled Mo3P@NiCoP/NF / / Mo3P@NiCoP/NF cell demands only a potential of 1.285 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm -2, and presents good durability within 12 h, which is one of the best electrochemistry activity and stability reported to date. Density functional theory suggests that NiCoP improves the reaction rate of this Mo3P@NiCoP/NF catalyst, and Mo3P enhances the metallicity of this catalyst, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of Mo3P@Ni- CoP/NF.																			0016-2361	1873-7153				JUN 1	2024	365								131219	10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131219	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131219		FEB 2024											WOS:001187965800001

Apart from the typical water oxidation reaction or oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is gaining more attention due to favorable thermodynamics. In this work, we study Si photoanodes modified with electrodeposited copper-nickel (CuNi) alloy for OER and UOR. The optimized photoanodes exhibit a low onset potential of 1.15 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a current density of 6 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs RHE (the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation) for OER. Further, CuNi alloy-modified photoanodes can drive the UOR at a lower onset potential (1.05 V vs RHE) and generate a higher current density of 31 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs RHE. Importantly, the CuNi alloy can extend the stability for UOR under PEC conditions when compared to a planar Ni film deposited by a vacuum-based process. This work demonstrates that CuNi alloy can further improve the properties of inhomogeneous metal-insulator-semiconductor Si photoanodes which can be efficiently utilized for both OER and UOR. Silicon photoanodes modified with CuNi show high performance for photoelectrochemical water oxidation and urea oxidation. The activation step by potential cycling occurs via Cu dealloying and NiOx formation, resulting in an inhomogeneous metal-insulator-semiconductor junction that can produce a large photovoltage. CuNi coating leads to higher electrocatalytic activity and better stability for urea oxidation compared to Ni-film. image					Pattanasattayavong, Pichaya/L-7664-2015; Loget, Gabriel/G-9558-2011	Pattanasattayavong, Pichaya/0000-0001-6374-1840; Klahan, Kanokwan/0000-0003-2345-1632; Loget, Gabriel/0000-0003-4809-5013													2199-692X					AUG	2024	10	8								10.1002/cnma.202400036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cnma.202400036		JUN 2024											WOS:001254114700001

Though in situ-formed NiOOH species are reported to be more active than the synthesized ones, the mechanistic study of the actual active species remains a daunting task due to the possibility of different phases and instability of surface-formed NiOOH. Herein, mechanistic UOR aspects of electrochemically activated metallic Ni60Nb40 Nanoglass showing stability toward the gamma-NiOOH phase are reported, probed via in situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by electron microscopy analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in contrast with the beta-NiOOH formation favored on Ni foil. Detailed mechanistic study further reveals that gamma-NiOOH predominantly follows a direct UOR mechanism while beta-NiOOH favors indirect UOR from time-dependent Raman study, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The Nanoglass has shown outstanding UOR performance with a low Tafel slope of 16 mV dec(-1) and stability for prolonged electrolysis (approximate to 38 mA cm(-2) for 70 h) that can be attributed to the nanostructured glassy interfaces facilitating more gamma-NiOOH species formation and stabilization on the surface. The present study opens up a new direction for the development of inexpensive Ni-based UOR catalysts and sheds light on the UOR mechanism.

However, the sluggish deprotonation process characterized by high energy barriers restricts the achievement of high efficiency. In this study, isoelectronic Co was introduced into Ni(OH)(2) by one-step hydrothermal reaction. The doped Co induced electrons located on Ni centre, and decreased the redox potential of Ni2+/Ni3+. Consequently, the performance of Ni(OH)(2) toward UOR was boosted, with the optimized 5 %Co-Ni(OH)(2) exhibiting the lowest potential of 1.357 V vs RHE at 100 mA cm(-2) and outstanding stability operating over 100 h at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, a cell assembled by 5 %Co-Ni(OH)(2)/NF and Pt/C/NF outperformed better performance of urea electrolysis comparing with the commercial cell assembled by Pt/C/NF and RuO2/NF. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the introduced Co regulated the electronic structure of Ni(OH)(2), resulting in an optimized d-band centre. Moreover, the doped Co altered the initial adsorption coordination of urea molecules on NiOOH surface and reduced energy barrier for the consecutive deprotonation process (rate-determination step), which enhanced catalytic dynamic and subsequently led to a boosted performance toward UOR.

As-prepared crystalline material was fully characterized by XRD, BET, XPS, SEM and HRTEM. The results demonstrate that OMS-2 has nanofiber with short nanorod morphologies, very rich oxygen vacancy defects and more exposed crystal facets compared with ones synthesized with other H2O2-containing reductants. These unique properties make nanostructural OMS-2 an excellent heterogeneous catalyst in aerobic oxidation reactions, such as selective oxidation of mercaptan and oxygenation of alkylarenes.

However, the practical application of this technology is limited by the lack of high-performance bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, a heterostructure catalyst composed of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) and sulfides (NiFe LDH-NiFeSx/NF) catalysts is prepared via a simple one-step hydrothermal approach. Remarkably, the prepared NiFe LDH-NiFeSx/NF required 138 mV and 1.34 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and UOR in 1 M KOH and 0.33 M urea, respectively. Furthermore, when NiFe LDH-NiFeSx/NF is used as a cathode for urea electrolysis, only 1.44 V is required at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than the 1.53 V needed for overall water splitting.

This study experimentally revealed that the degradation of OG substantially restricted the oxidation performance for As(III). To mitigate the unwanted inhibition arising from the decomposition of OG, persulfate (PS) was intentionally added, which synergistically expedited the reaction kinetics for governing the oxidation performance for both OG and As(III). Hydroxyl radicals formed in the presence of g-C3N4 become a driving force for PS to expedited sulfate radicals, which substantially increased the oxidation of OG and As(III). The intrinsic structure of g-C3N4 enhancing the photocatalytic stability guaranteed the re-usability of the photocatalyst. For instance, the fabricated photocatalyst in this study exhibited the same oxidation performance at least three times. Despite the intrinsic charring compound (i.e., high porosity), this study reported that the synthesized catalyst did not adsorb As species, therefore, the further treatment is required to remove the oxidized As. Thus, all experimental findings suggest that g-C3N4 derived from urea and PS could synergistically co-oxidize azo dye compound and As(III) from the aqueous phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

As one of the popular non-precious metal catalysts for the MOR/UOR research in recent years, nickel-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have abundant active sites and low cost, but suffer from poor catalytic activity and poor stability. In the present study, we prepared NiAl LDH and then grew NiSe2 in situ on its surface at different temperatures, and the catalyst obtained at 450 & DEG;C (4NiAlSe-450) exhibited excellent MOR/UOR electrocatalytic performance with potentials of 1.37 V vs. RHE and 1.36 V vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, respectively, which were much higher than those of NiAl LDH (1.42 V vs. RHE and 1.39 vs. RHE). Chronoamperometry curves of 4NiAlSe-450 at 1.5 V potential showed that the methanol/urea oxidation was stable for more than 3 h. The physicochemical properties of 4NiAlSe-450 were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and other techniques, and the results showed that the NiSe2 nanoparticles were successfully grown in situ on the calcined layered structure, and therefore the excellent MOR/UOR electrocatalytic performance of 4NiAlSe-450 may be due to the synergistic effect between the NiAl composite oxides and NiSe2.

The as-fabricated NFs were investigated in terms of morphology, crystallinity and surface chemistry through FESEM, TEM, EDX, XRD and XPS measurements. These analyses confirmed that the designed material owned metallic NPs encapsulated in carbon NFs. The introduced material had a rich carbon content on the surface which was due to the use of polyvinyl alcohol as a precursor polymer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and impedance (EIS) analyses were applied in a three-electrode system to study the efficiency of the fabricated NFs for urea electrooxidation. The synthesized NFs showed superior catalytic behavior in the alkaline medium towards urea oxidation. The high efficiency was found to be at 0.5 M of urea according to the influence of urea and applied potential studies. This superior activity can be due to the assembly of trimetallic system CoNi/Cr encapsulated C-NFs which has rarely been studied before. This study presents the preparation of a novel cheap material to facilitate the urea fuel cell commercialization.

However, it is plagued by sluggish kinetics and noble-metal catalyst requirements. Herein, we developed nickel-iron-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanolayers with abundant oxygen vacancies (OV) via synergistically etching nickel foam with Fe3+ and Cl- ions, enabling the efficient conversion of urea into H2 and N2. The synthesized OV-NiFe-LDH exhibits a lower potential (1.30 vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) for achieving 10 mA cm-2 in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), surpassing most recently reported Ni-based electrodes. OV provides favorable conductivity and a large surface area, which results in a 4.1-fold in electron transport and a 5.1-fold increase in catalyst reactive sites. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that OV can lower the adsorption energy of urea, and enhance the bonding strength of *CONHNH, giving rise to improved UOR. This study provides a viable path toward economical and efficient production of high -purity hydrogen.

Therefore, the development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for water splitting assisted by urea is highly desirable. Herein, Sn-doped CoS2 electrocatalysts were reported with the engineered electronic structure and the formation of Co-Sn dual active sites for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Consequently, the number of active sites and the intrinsic activity were enhanced simultaneously and the resultant electrodes exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity with a very low potential of 1.301 V at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for UOR and an overpotential of 132 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for HER. Therefore, a two-electrode device was assembled by employing Sn(2)-CoS2/CC and Sn(5)-CoS2/CC and the constructed cell required only 1.45 V to approach a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) along with good durability for at least 95 h assisted by urea. More importantly, the assembled electrolyzer can be powered by commercial dry battery to generate numerous gas bubbles on the surface of the electrodes, demonstrating the high potential of the as-fabricated electrodes for applications in hydrogen production and pollutant treatment at a low-voltage electrical energy input.

Crystallization of NiCo MOF-74 on a Porous NiO Film as an Anode for the Urea/H2O2 Fuel Cell	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS												NiCo-MOF-74 crystallized directly on the surface of porous NiO (p-NiO) film using a solvothermal method is proposed as an effective electrocatalyst for the anode in direct urea fuel cells. A nickel-to-cobalt ratio of 4:1 was found to show optimum catalytic activity toward urea oxidation with significant current enhancement in comparison to other electrodes, including Ni foil and p-NiO. At optimized conditions in an electrolyte solution of 3.0 M KOH and 1.0 M urea, a current density of around 110 mA cm-2 with a maximum power density of 4131 mu W cm-2 can be produced. This is ascribed to the increase of the active surface area over conventional nickel-based anodes, providing an abundance of active sites for urea oxidation. Excellent stability and reproducibility over 15 h application in a direct urea fuel cell was obtained with cell voltage of similar to 0.6 V. Powder X-ray diffraction shows the crystalline MOF film remains intact after chronoamperometry tests, and after fuel cell application, illustrating applicability in real devices.

M.; Yassin, Mohamed A.; Yasin, Ahmed S.; Al-Meer, Saeed			Influence of nitrogen doping on the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-incorporated carbon nanofibers toward urea oxidation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Overall, boosting the formation of the active NiOOH layer distinctly improves the electro catalytic activity of nickel-based materials. Moreover, due to the adsorption capacity, the carbonaceous supports improve the electrocatalytic activities of several function materials including nickel. In this manuscript, nitrogen doping is introduced as an effective strategy to enhance formation of the NiOOH active layer on the surface of nickel nanoparticles decorating carbon nanofibers. Typically, addition of urea to the nickel acetate/poly(vinyl alcohol)/water sol-gel leads to obtain nitrogen-doped and nickel-decorated carbon nano fibers after electrospinning the prepared solution and calcination the nanofiber mats under Ar at 750 degrees C. The invoked characterizations including XRD, TEM, SEM and XPS affirmed formation of smooth nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers decorated by crystalline nickel nanoparticles. Nitrogen doping strongly enhanced the formation of NiOOH active layer on the surface of the metallic nanoparticles which distinctly improved the electrocatalytic activity toward urea oxidation. However, the electrochemical measurements indicated that the content of the urea in the initial electrospun solution should be optimized as the results showed that the best nickel surface activation as well as the maximum observed current density can be achieved when the urea content is kept at 5 wt%. Typically, the observed current densities using 1.0 M urea (in 1 M KOH) were 3.15, 29.7, 13.75, 47.55, 14.13 and 9.85 mA/cm(2) for the nanofibers obtained from electrospun solutions having 0, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 9 wt% urea, respectively. Moreover, the proposed nitrogen doping strategy leads to perform a distinguish decrease in the onset potential of the urea electrooxidation which reduces the required energy for the electrolysis process.

Therefore, developing a green and facile method for nano-sized catalyst preparation is very significative. In this work, a series of nano-sized Co3O4/CeO2 catalysts with high specific surface area, high oxygen storage and homogeneous distribution of active species were synthesized via a glucose-urea (G-U method), and applied in NO oxidation The NO oxidation performance indicates that the 12.5% CoCeG_U catalyst prepared by the G-U method shows higher activity than those of catalysts prepared by the traditional methods (precipitation, hydrothermal and impreg-nation methods). The characterization results revealed that the CoCeG_U catalysts have the highest specific surface area, pore volume, content of surface Ce3+ and Co3+ among the catalysts. Moreover, the nano Co3O4 is better dispersed on CeO2, which resulted in more active oxygen species on the surface of the catalysts prepared by the G-U method. Herein, the higher specific surface area, the smaller Co3O4 nanoparticles, the more active oxygen species and the higher Ce3+ and Co3+ contents of the CoCeG_U catalyst lead to the more excellent NO oxidation performance. This work provides a green and efficient approach for the industrial production of nano-sized oxide catalysts.

The NiO NSs on rGO (rGO-NiO) are characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses, and electrochemical analysis. Electrocatalytic activity of rGO-NiO nanocomposite modified glassy carbon (GC/rGO-NiO) electrode is examined towards electrocatalytic oxidation of urea in 0.1 M NaOH using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry techniques. The GC/rGO(0.1)-NiO nanocomposite modified electrode shows enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of urea than that of other modified electrodes due to the incorporation of NiO NSs on an optimum amount of rGO. The GC/rGO(0.1)-NiO modified electrode is used for designing electrochemical sensor for urea, and the detection limit is estimated as 0.47 mu M using the amperometry technique. The sensitivity of GC/rGO(0.1)-NiO modified electrode is found to be 2450 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). In addition to good electroanalytical performance, the present urea sensor displayed good stability and acceptable anti-interference ability in the presence of 20-fold excess concentration of relevant interferents.

NiOF could be converted into nickel with a face-centered cubic structure and nickel oxide with a cubic rock-salt crystal structure after heating above 425 degrees C in air atmosphere. The organic units played a key role in the formation of well-dispersed nickel/nickel oxide nanoparticles. Primary particle size could be decreased by lowering the calcination temperature. Electrophoresis allowed for depositing a thin layer of nickel/nickel oxide nanoparticles on the skeleton of macroporous nickel foam (NF) as a catalyst electrode for electro-oxidation of urea. Nickel/nickel oxide nanoparticles derived from NiOF at 425 degrees C possessed large amounts of redox active sites (Ni2+/Ni3+), and thus was capable of enhancing the current density and efficiency in urea electrolysis. NF substrate with unique macroporous conductive structure exhibited electrocatalytic behavior towards urea electrolysis and allowed for rapid transport of electron, electrolyte, and gaseous products. Therefore, coating of nickel/nickel oxide nanoparticles on NF provided a possible way for further enhancing the electrocatalytic ability of electrode in urea electrolysis, making it favorable for large-scale applications.

It is observed that the morphology of the calcined NiCr catalyst, which has a higher specific surface area, is identical to that of the electrospun NiCr catalyst fiber. Cr-doping at 40% (Cr/Ni) significantly increases the oxidation peak current of the urea oxidation reaction. The addition of carbon nanotubes also considerably enhances the catalytic activity. A direct urea/H2O2 fuel cell, which utilizes the synthesized catalyst (NiCr-CNT@C) as a free-standing anode, exhibits excellent performance with a maximum power density of 48.1 mW cm(-2) and an open-circuit voltage of 0.92 Vat 80 degrees C.

Here, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of UOR before the NSOR via constructing a 2D/2D heterostructure that consists of ultrathin NiO anchored Ru Co dual-atom support (Ru-Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations confirm this unique triggering mechanism on the surface of Ru-Co DAS/NiO. Consequently, the fabricated catalyst exhibits outstanding UOR activity with a low potential of 1.288 V at 10 mAcm(-2) and remarkable long-term durability for more than 330 h operation. DFT calculations and spectroscopic characterizations demonstrate that the favorable electronic structure induced by this unique heterointerface endows the catalyst energetically more favorable for the UOR than the NSOR.

Therefore, the need to use clean and renewable sources such as hydrogen has increased. The synthesis and design of effective electrocatalysts are important to generate hydrogen via urea electrocatalysis with the minimum required energy. In the present research, Ni-S nanostructures doped with molybdenum (Mo) supported on nickel foam substrates were synthesized by the facile one-step cyclic voltammetry (CV) method, and some of the efficient factors such as scan rate, number of cycles, and molybdenum concentration were optimized to generate the minimum required overpotential. The proposed electrode was used as a working electrode for urea-assisted electrochemical hydrogen production. The activity and electrocatalytic stability of the prepared electrodes were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), CV, Tafel polarization curve, and chronopotentiometry (CP) in 1 M NaOH thorn 0.33 M urea electrolyte. The results showed that the optimal electrode (50 mV/s scan rate and 10 cycles) has excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) equal to -142.2 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. In addition, the optimal electrode showed outstanding activity for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a potential of 1.36 V (vs. RHE) to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2, which is due to the high surface-to-volume ratio, maximizing the number of active sites, good electrical conductivity, and synergistic effect of elements. On the contrary, to reach 10 mA/cm2, OER requires 1.55 (vs. RHE). In addition, an overall urea splitting cell voltage of only 2.52 and 2.76 V (vs. RHE) is needed to obtain 10 mA/cm2 current in urea and without urea-containing electrolytes, respectively. Therefore, replacing UOR with OER reduces the energy consumption of hydrogen production.

Whatever kind of nickel-based catalysts is utilized to catalyze UOR, it is widely believed that the in situ-formed Ni3+ moieties are the true active sites and the as-utilized nickel-based catalysts just serve as pre-catalysts. Digging the pre-catalyst effect on the activity of Ni3+ moieties helps to better design nickel-based catalysts. Herein, five different anions of OH-, CO32-, SiO32-, MoO42-, and WO42- were used to bond with Ni2+ to fabricate the pre-catalysts beta-Ni(OH)2, Ni-CO3, Ni-SiO3, Ni-MoO4, and Ni-WO4. It is found that the true active sites of the five as-fabricated catalysts are the same in situ-formed Ni3+ moieties and the five as-fabricated catalysts demonstrate different UOR activity. Although the as-synthesized five catalysts just serve as the pre-catalysts, they determine the quantity of active sites and activity per active site, thus determining the catalytic activity of the catalysts. Among the five catalysts, the amorphous nickel tungstate exhibits the most superior activity per active site and can catalyze UOR to reach 158.10 mA<middle dot>cm-2 at 1.6 V, exceeding the majority of catalysts. This work makes for a deeper understanding of the pre-catalyst effect on UOR activity and helps to better design nickel-based UOR catalysts.					peike, wang/HRD-0257-2023; Ren, Zhongqi/HCI-4897-2022; liu, haipeng/AAE-6689-2022; Wei, Jun/K-3584-2015	Chen, Lina/0000-0002-9580-7389														1420-3049				JUL	2024	29	14							3321	10.3390/molecules29143321	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules29143321								39064899					WOS:001277298500001

Herein, bifunctional Co 0 & sdot;9 Mo 0.1 -Se/Cu 7 Se 4 heterojunction electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) were prepared. Notably, selenization by strong reducibility triggered the generation of abundant Co 3+ active sites and heterogeneous structures, as well as improved electrical conductivity. The Co 0 & sdot;9 Mo 0.1 -Se/Cu 7 Se 4 electrocatalyst showed excellent OER activity, requiring only 202 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , and the Tafel slope was only 78.91 mV dec - 1 . Overpotential of the catalyst did not change significantly during the 38 h stability test, indicating that the electrocatalyst had excellent long-term stability. Moreover, when Co 0 & sdot;9 Mo 0.1 -Se/Cu 7 Se 4 was used as the UOR electrode, the heterojunction required 1.29 V at 10 mA cm -2 .

Herein, N-doped hierarchical carbons with partial spheres were successfully obtained from urea oxidation of glucose hydrochar, followed by KOH activation. Surface areas of carbons largely increased from 1469 to 3282 m(2) g(-1) as the etching temperature increased from 600 degrees to 800 degrees C, while N-species decreased from 7.23 to 1.26 at%. The as-made carbons had superior removal ability for Rhodamine B (RhB), and AHU-800 sample including surface areas of 3282 m(2) g(-1), mesopores of 2.74 nm and 1.26 at% N-species had equilibrium amount of 2949 mg g(-1) at 25 degrees C in 1000 mg L-1 solution up to 300 min, followed by a pseudo-second order model. The maximum capacity on AHU800 was up to 5181 mg g(-1) determined by Langmuir model, among the best results for carbon-based adsorbents. This present method contributed to large-scale production of high-quality sorbents for dye-bearing water, and the superior removal performance was owned to synergistic effects of high surface areas, hierarchically pores and pyrrolic N in the framework, endowing these carbons to be highly effective in water treatment application.

Its sustainability is currently founded on innocuous N-2 products; however, we discovered that prevalent nickel-based catalysts could generally over-oxidize urea into NO2- products with approximate to 80 % Faradaic efficiencies, posing potential secondary hazards to the environment. Trace amounts of over-oxidized NO3- and N2O were also detected. Using N-15 isotopes and urea analogues, we derived a nitrogen-fate network involving a NO2--formation pathway via OH--assisted C-N cleavage and two N-2-formation pathways via intra- and intermolecular coupling. DFT calculations confirmed that C-N cleavage is energetically more favorable. Inspired by the mechanism, a polyaniline-coating strategy was developed to locally enrich urea for increasing N-2 production by a factor of two. These findings provide complementary insights into the nitrogen fate in water-energy nexus systems.

Here we report a Mn-doped NiSx/NiO/Ni3N nanosheets arrays loaded on nickel foam (denoted by Mn-NiSx/NiO/Ni3N@NF) catalyst through a simple hydrothermal and thioureaassisted solid reaction. Benefitting from the densely interlaced network structure and plentiful heterojunctions induced by Mn dopant, Mn-NiSx/NiO/Ni3N@NF displays a superior HER and UOR activity. In the alkaline urea electrolyte, a low potential of 93 mV (for HER) and 1.31 V (for UOR) are needed to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). Assembled in a symmetrical two-electrode electrolyzer, Mn-NiSx/NiO/Ni3N@NF can require a cell voltage of 1.70 V to deliver 100 mA cm-2 in alkaline urea medium, reducing by 200 and 239 mV in contrast with the commercial Pt/C@NF||RuO2@NF couple and the conventional water splitting, respectively. Furthermore, Mn-NiSx/NiO/Ni3N@NF as UOR electrode can impel urea removal rate reach up 56% after a successive operation for 32 h. The work provides a green and sustainable strategy from sewage treatment to recycling accompanied by energy-saving hydrogen production and urea-rich wastewater degradation.

Herein, various surface defect engineering routes were adopted to enhance the low-temperature propane oxidation of 8-MnO2. Compared to reducing etchants urea and vitamin C, 8-MnO2 treated with urea -H2O2 exhibited an excellent thermal (T90 = 240 celcius) and photothermal (T90 = 196 celcius) activities of propane oxidation. Urea -H2O2 treatment provided high concen-tration of Mn4+and surface-active oxygen (Mn4+-Osur) species as surface-active sites, and produced numerous oxygen vacancies to improve charge separation and superoxide species generation capacity. Thus, the photothermal conversion efficiency and low-temperature reducibility were remarkably enhanced. Furthermore, the photothermal synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed based on in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and control experiments. The strategy here offered insight into the rational design of efficient transition catalysts, and in-depth understanding of the photothermal catalytic VOCs removal mechanism.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

To promote the sluggish kinetics of UOR, highly efficient electrocatalysts are required, and Ni-based materials have been widely investigated. However, most of these reported Ni-based catalysts suffer from large overpotentials, as they generally undergo self-oxidation to form NiOOH species at high potentials, which act as catalytically active sites for UOR. Herein, Ni-doped MnO2 (Ni-MnO2) nanosheet arrays were successfully prepared on nickel foam. The as-fabricated Ni-MnO2 shows distinct UOR behavior with most of the previously reported Ni-based catalysts, as urea oxidation on Ni-MnO2 proceeds before the formation of NiOOH. Notably, a low potential of 1.388 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode was required to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm-2 on Ni-MnO2. It is suggested that both Ni doping and nanosheet array configuration are responsible for the high UOR activities on Ni-MnO2. The introduction of Ni modifies the electronic structure of Mn atoms, and more Mn3+ species are generated in Ni-MnO2 , contributing to its outstanding UOR performance.

Herein, it is reported that Nitrogen-doped Co9S8/Ni3S2 hybrid nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (N-Co9S8/Ni3S2/NF) can act as an active and robust bifunctional catalyst for both urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which could drive an ultrahigh current density of 400 mA cm(-2) at a low working potential of 1.47 V versus RHE for UOR, and gives a low overpotential of 111 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) toward HER. Further, a hybrid water electrolysis cell utilizing the synthesized N-Co9S8/Ni3S2/NF electrode as both the cathode and anode displays a low cell voltage of 1.40 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which can be powered by an AA battery with a nominal voltage of 1.5 V. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations decipher that N-doped heterointerfaces can synergistically optimize Gibbs free energy of hydrogen and urea, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics of HER and UOR.

Robust amorphous iron (II) diphosphate on nickel foam: Aggrandizing electronic structure for efficient catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution and urea oxidation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												The few intuitive challenges are the high clean energy demand, the dire need for sustainable development, and low carbon footprints. Thereby, the wastewater rich in urea from sanitary units, and industries are subjected to produce green energy as a source for hydrogen through waste water-splitting. Thus, anodic reaction in electrochemical hydrogen production is the most widely promoted towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). However, both possess sluggish kinetics which need to be improved. Therefore, the development of novel materials that can meet the demands of both reaction mechanisms is highly required. Herein, Fe2P2O7-based composite grown on the conductive substrate can effectively enhance the electrical transportation of ions during electrocatalytic activity. The experimental and theoretical investigations are adopted to get a comprehensive insight and understanding of the catalytic nature of the as-prepared samples. Compared with other as-synthesized materials, Fe2P2O7 exhibits splendid performance with a low onset potential of 1.482 and 1.317 V (vs RHE) to obtain a current density of 10 mA/cm2 towards the OER and UOR process, respectively. The low Tafel slope and high turnover frequency offer low resistance during charge transfer. Additionally, greater ECSA and roughness factors enrich the attributes of Fe2P2O7 and offer more active sites for reaction to be held, producing a higher amount of gas bubbles. Hence, improved electrical conductivity, low charge transfer resistance, more electrochemical active surface area, and impressive durability reconfirm the Fe2P2O7 as an effective catalyst.

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) occurring at the anode are impeded by the sluggish reaction kinetics during the water-splitting process. Consequently, it is promising to develop bifunctional anodic electrocatalysts consisting of nonprecious metals. Herein, a bifunctional CoMn layered double hydroxide (LDH) was grown on nickel foam (NF) with a 1D-2D-3D hierarchical structure for efficient OER and UOR performance in alkaline solution. Owing to the significant synergistic effect of Mn doping and heterostructure engineering, the obtained Co1Mn1LDH/NF exhibits satisfactory OER activity with a low potential of 1.515 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, the potential of the Co1Mn1LDH/NF catalyst for UOR at the same current density is only 1.326 V, which is much lower than those of its counterparts and most reported electrocatalysts.

Unfortunately, the poor conductivity of NiO makes efficient charge transfer within the heterogeneous structures difficult, thereby inhibiting the improvement of its intrinsic activity. Herein, F-doped NiO/Ni@C heterogeneous catalyst (F-NiO/Ni@C) is fabricated via a new organic-inorganic hybrid approach, showing both advanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity. The targeted F-doping increases electron delocalization, and facilitates electron transfer from Ni to NiO at the nano-interfaces. This interphase synergy provides ready-to-use F-NiO active sites, allowing F-NiO/Ni@C to achieve optimum H* adsorption Gibbs free energy for HER and a lower energy barrier for UOR. As a result, the as-configured F-NiO/Ni@C || F-NiO/Ni@C cell requires an ultra-low cell voltage of 1.37 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media (with 0.3 M urea), outperforming the state-of-the-art benchmark Pt/C|| RuO2 cell (1.45 V). This study reveals the positive impact of anion doping on interphase synergy and provides useful guidelines for designing monometallic catalysts for UOR as well as hydrogen generation.

However, exploring an efficient anode material for DUFCs still remains a huge challenge. In this work, a Ni-P hierarchical porous nanoglass (HPNG) catalytic electrode was developed via a low-cost, industrially available electrodeposition technique, which exhibits one of the best performances reported so far in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), with a potential of 1.330 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 9.77 mV dec(-1). The superior UOR performance of the HPNG electrode is attributed to the excellent intrinsic catalytic activity of NG with a high-energy state and an extremely enlarged surface area from the unique 3D hierarchical porous structure. Furthermore, a DUFC system with the HPNG anode shows a performance breakthrough as indicated by the maximum power density of 38.15 mW cm(-2) for 0.5 M urea, representing one of the best yet reported DUFCs. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of the scalable production of HPNG electrodes and is expected to be a great contribution to the development of the practical use of DUFCs in the near future for bifunctional energy conversion.

Modified NiFe2O4-Supported Graphene Oxide for Effective Urea Electrochemical Oxidation and Water Splitting Applications	MOLECULES												The production of green hydrogen using water electrolysis is widely regarded as one of the most promising technologies. On the other hand, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is thermodynamically unfavorable and needs significant overpotential to proceed at a sufficient rate. Here, we outline important structural and chemical factors that affect how well a representative nickel ferrite-modified graphene oxide electrocatalyst performs in efficient water splitting applications. The activities of the modified pristine and graphene oxide-supported nickel ferrite were thoroughly characterized in terms of their structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties. This research shows that the NiFe2O4@GO electrode has an impact on both the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and water splitting applications. NiFe2O4@GO was observed to have a current density of 26.6 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M urea and 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 20 mV s(-1). The Tafel slope provided for UOR was 39 mV dec(-1), whereas the GC/NiFe2O4@GO electrode reached a current of 10 mA cm(-2) at potentials of +1.5 and -0.21 V (vs. RHE) for the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Furthermore, charge transfer resistances were estimated for OER and HER as 133 and 347 Omega cm(2), respectively.

J	Chan, YH; Wu, MS				Chan, Yu-Hsin; Wu, Mao-Sung			Electrochemically embedded nickel oxide in a highly porous manganese oxide film with enhanced catalytic kinetics of the urea oxidation reaction	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												The use of well-dispersed nickel catalysts with atomic-scale sizes is an effective approach for maximizing catalytic activity and selectivity for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, a porous ultrathin film of Birnessite-type manganese oxide is anodically deposited on a nickel substrate as a catalyst support. Some of the intercalated sodium ions are replaced by the dissolved nickel ions from the nickel substrate in the anodic process, forming manganese oxide with partially intercalated nickel ions (denoted MnO2). The amount of nickel species can be easily increased by cyclic voltammetry in the nickel sulfate electrolyte (denoted MnO2-Ni), without the relatively time-consuming process of conventional ion exchange. Most of the embedded nickel species are catalytic Ni3+ ions, rendering MnO2-Ni a favorable catalyst to boost the UOR. The cyclic voltammetry results reveal that Ni3+ catalysts, when inserted into the layer-structured manganese oxide, can increase the electroactive surface area for the adsorption of urea and increase the charge-transfer rate constant for the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple, leading to an improved catalytic rate constant of the UOR. A highly porous manganese oxide matrix provides many transport pathways for facilitating UOR kinetics. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that MnO2-Ni has lower direct and indirect UOR impedances than MnO2 and bare Ni electrodes, leading to a greater oxidation current and lower onset potential.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, reports on metalloporphyrins as catalysts for the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) remain scarce. With these considerations in mind, the triphenylamine-Ni(II) porphyrin (NiPor-TPA) was synthesized through the solvothermal approach from 5,10,15,20-tetrakis [4-(diphenylamino)phenyl]porphyrin and nickel(II) acetate in this work. Experimental results reveal that the introduction of Ni species can serve as active sites and activate urea oxidation efficiently, and thus the prepared catalysts deliver better electrocatalytic activity than the metal-free TPA. The NiPor-TPA electrode delivers the lowest potential of 1.34 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm-2 for UOR with a Tafel slope of 44.6 mV dec-1. This work proposes a new porphyrin-based molecular catalyst for effectively boosting electrocatalytic UOR activity. The pi-conjugated macroring structure and the excellent electrocatalytic properties both make NiPor-TPA one of the burgeoning electrocatalytic UORs.

Nickel nanoparticles-decorated graphene as highly effective and stable electrocatalyst for urea electrooxidation	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS A-CHEMICAL												Among the various carbonaceous materials, graphene is highly considered to provide the optimum support for the electrocatalytic materials due to its excellent electrical conductivity and extremely large surface area. In literature, based on our best knowledge, few studies have been reported to introduce effective electrocatalysts for urea oxidation. In this study, Ni-decorated graphene sheets are introduced as effective and stable electrocatalyst for urea oxidation. The introduced composite was prepared by reflux of graphene oxide with nickel acetate at 120 degrees C for 10h followed by calcination in argon atmosphere at 850 degrees C for 2 h. X-ray diffractometer (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy techniques confirmed formation of graphene sheets decorated by nickel nanoparticles. The synthesized Ni-decorate graphene shows distinct electrocatalytic activity toward urea oxidation. Numerically, using 2 M urea solution (in 1 M KOH) the corresponding current density was 150 mAcm(-2) (2100 mAcm(-2) g(-1)) with clear urea oxidation peaks in the forward and reverse scans. Study the influence of metal loading indicated that the amount of nickel nanoparticles should be optimized as the best performance has been observed when equal amounts of nickel acetate and graphene oxides were utilized during the preparation process. The introduced decorated graphene reveals good stability at various applied voltages. Overall, the study emphasizes the advantage of using graphene as support to distinctly enhancing urea electrooxidation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is important to note that catalytic performance depends on the electron cloud density configuration around different metals of the same type of material. Herein, a series of well-tuned MWO4 (M = Co, Ni, Zn and Cu) nanoarrays was in site grown on Ni foam substrates using a single-step hydrothermal process for the first time. It is worth mentioning that as prepared NiWO4 electrode significantly improves urea oxidation activity with an applied voltage of 1.36 V at 100 mA cm(-2), which is lower than that of CoWO4 (1.37 V@100 mA cm(-2)), ZnWO4 (1.38 V@100 mA cm(-2)) and CuWO4 (1.42 V@100 mA cm(-2)). Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the superior activity of the electrodes is mainly attributed to the optimal urea adsorption energy, fast electron transfer rate, more active site exposure, lower impedance and better conductivity of the material.

Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a more effective way to improve the energy efficiency of H 2 generation. Herein, a highly efficient 2D NiFeMo-based UOR catalyst and 1D NiFeMo-based HER catalyst are prepared by adjusting the concentration of MoO 4 - . The MoO 4 - can serve as the key regulator to adjust the balance between the electrolytic dissociation ( alpha ) of the reactants and the supersaturation ( S ) to modulate the morphological and electronic structure. The prepared 2D NiFeMo nanosheet UOR catalyst and 1D NiFeMo nanorod HER catalyst can achieve a current density of 100 mA cm -2 at a potential of 1.36 and 0.062 V, respectively. In a HER/UOR system, a cell voltage of 1.58 V is needed to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm -2 . The HER/UOR system operated stably for over 60 h with 3 times the direct water electrolysis current density. Moreover, the in situ Raman characterization coupled with XPS analysis clarifies that the addition of high -valence Mo can lower the transition energy barrier between the low and high oxidation state of Ni, which in turn lowers the overpotential of UOR. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing morphology -dependent electrocatalysts for different catalytic systems.

However, the intrinsic sluggish kinetics of the UOR hampers the real application of these urea-based technologies. Therefore, highly efficient electrocatalysts are required to promote the urea oxidation process. During the past several years, great achievements in both catalyst design and mechanism understanding have been made in this research area. This perspective starts with the discussion of the reaction mechanism of the UOR. Afterwards, we propose and discuss five typical strategies for designing efficient UOR electrocatalysts including promoting the *COO desorption step, developing electrocatalysts with high oxidation states, facilitating the generation of catalytically active species, constructing dual active sites, and heterojunction catalysts via featured examples.

Still, it remains a great challenge how to use the space-charge region of p-n heterojunction to study the regulation mechanism of the p-n heterogeneous interface and vacancy defects on the incomplete self-reconstruction from pristine materials to (oxy) hydroxides. Herein, NH2-MIL-88b(Fe)/alpha-Fe2O3 p-n heterojunction with rich oxygen vacancies (denoted as p-n MIL-88@Fe2O3-OV) has been prepared using a simple one-step solvothermal method. The prepared catalyst exhibits promising electrocatalytic performance for OER and UOR, requiring low potentials of 1.50 and 1.35 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The combined in-situ/ex-situ experimental and theoretical investigations unveil that p-n heterojunction engineering can not only facilitate charge transfer from ntype alpha-Fe2O3 to p-type NH2-MIL-88b(Fe) (denoted as MIL-88) and generate abundant oxygen vacancies, but also appreciably trigger phase transformation of MIL-88 into active FeOOH. The reconstructed FeOOH/alpha-Fe2O3 heterojunction optimizes the bonding strength towards key oxygen-containing intermediates and boosts the intrinsic activity.

Porous clusters of Fe, W co-doped nickel sulfide catalysts were directly grown on nickel foam (NF) by one-step hydrothermal method. The obtained FeW-Ni3S2/NiS@NF showed excellent catalytic performance toward OER in 1 M KOH, with an overpotential of 236 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and 251 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), which markedly surpassed the performance of catalyst samples doped with Fe and W alone. In addition, FeW-Ni3S2/NiS@NF displayed excellent electrocatalytic performance toward UOR: a potential of only 1.354 V (vs. RHE) was required to drive the reaction at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The introduction of Fe and W elements into the catalyst can not only promote the regulation of the morphology of FeW-Ni3S2/NiS@NF for exposing more active sites, but also the interaction between the Fe and W salts that significantly increases the OER and UOR performances. This work provides an effective strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts.																			1452-3981					OCT	2022	17	10							221043	10.20964/2022.10.24	http://dx.doi.org/10.20964/2022.10.24													WOS:000885086000043

However, recent studies have shown that there is a process by which nitrifiers convert urea-derived nitrogen (urea-N) into nitrate. We examined these two processes in the shelf and off-shelf regions of the Arctic Ocean. Urea concentration was high near the bottom in the shelf region, while it was depleted throughout the water column in the off-shelf region. Urea-N assimilation was generally higher in the upper euphotic zone than the lower euphotic zone. By contrast, urea-N oxidation was low in the upper euphotic zone and increased with depth. These results indicate that urea sinks consist of a two-layer system. We further examined the organisms involved in urea-N oxidation and found a dominance of shallow clade ammonia-oxidizing archaea, whose abundance was low in the upper euphotic zone and increased with depth. The abundances of archaeal ureC and amoA genes of shallow clade ammonia-oxidizing archaea were well correlated (rho = 0.96, Spearman's correlation), suggesting that most of shallow clade ammonia-oxidizing archaea could use urea as a source of ammonia oxidation. However, we found that the urea-N oxidation rate often exceeded the ammonia oxidation rate while kinetics experiments suggested that ammonia oxidizers use urea less actively than ammonia.

Compared with traditional water electrolysis for hydrogen production, it not only saves costs and energy consumption, but also can treat urea wastewater to purify the environment. In this paper, the sea urchin-like nanoneedles (M (M = Cr, Mo and W)-FeCo2P/NF) arrays with different doping elements M (M = Cr, Mo and W) were prepared by hydrothermal method and moderate temperature phosphating method. It is proved that the doping of different elements in the same group cooperates to adjust the electronic structure of Co2P, thereby increasing the electrochemical active area and improving the active site. What is noteworthy is that Mo-FeCo2P/NF material only needs potential of 1.305 V and overpotential of 232 mV to drive 50 mA cm-2 for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Mo-FeCo2P/NF (+/-) electrolyser can drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of 1.471 V, and is stable for at least 12 h in urea electrolysis. The density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that Mo-FeCo2P/NF electrode has a moderate Gibbs free energy (GH*) of H adsorption. This work put forward a new strategy for improving the activity and stability of transition metal phosphides by doping strategy for urea electrolysis. (c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we report an electrocatalyst with co-existing V-dopants and Ni(OH)2/FeOOH interfaces (referred to as A-NiFeV/NF, with "A" indicating "activated"). The electron coupling between Ni, Fe and V, analyzed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicates that Ni and Fe both receive electrons from the V. Additionally, the Fe can also lead to a bias toward a lower valence of the Ni centers in Ni(OH)2. Further in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that Ni2+(OH)2 inevitably undergoes transformation into amorphous Ni3+OOH during the activation process, however, the synergistic effects of V-dopants and Ni(OH)2/FeOOH interfaces keep the Ni centers mostly in a lower oxidation state of +2 even at high potential ranges. These low-valence Ni centers are proposed to be positively correlated with the optimized OER activity of the Ni-based electrocatalysts. As a result, the designed ANiFeV/NF electrocatalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 234 and 313 mV to propel current densities of 10 and 100 mA/cm2, and a small Tafel slope of 37.8 mV/dec for OER in 1.0 M KOH. The catalyst demonstrates a stable OER activity for over 100 h at 100 mA/cm2. Additionally, it can be integrated with a solar cell to construct a solar-driven electrolytic OER device without additional electric input. Similarly, for the small molecule oxidation, UOR, only -1.33 and -1.39 V vs. RHE (RHE: reversible hydrogen electrode) are required to achieve 10 and 100 mA/cm2, respectively, in an electrolyte composed of 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea.

In the case of OER application studies ZnCo2O4 is an excellent electrocatalyst, towards the UOR has been performed with surface-grown polydopamine (PDA) with surface-grown polydopamine (PDA). ZnCo2O4@PDA is produced over the surface of nickel foam by a hydrothermal method followed by self-polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride. Dopamine hydrochloride was varied in solution to study the optimal growth of PDA necessary to enhance the electrochemical activity. Prepared ZnCo2O4@PDA was characterized by X-ray diffraction, electronic structural, and morphology/microstructure studies. With successful confirmation, the developed electrode material was applied to UOR and ZnCo2O4@PDA-1.5, delivering an excellent low overpotential of 80 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) in the electrolyte mixture of 1 M potassium hydroxide+0.33 M urea. To support the excellent UOR activity, other electrochemical properties such as the Tafel slope, electrochemical surface active sites, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also studied. Furthermore, a schematic illustration explaining the UOR mechanism is shown to allow a clear understanding of the obtained electrochemical activity. Finally, urea water electrolysis was carried out in a two-electrode symmetrical cell and compared with water electrolysis. This clearly showed the potential of the developed material for efficient electrochemical hydrogen production.

On the other hand, a strategy utilizing renewable electricity to decrease the cost of green hydrogen, which holds the key to a sustainable energy future, is promising but challenging. Gas crossover that generates explosive hydrogen?oxygen mixture becomes very serious with intermittent renewable power source (partial load issue). Herein, we address these issues in one device, i.e., a hybrid electrolyzer where water oxidation that produces oxygen is replaced by urea oxidation which generates inert gases. A self-supported electrocatalyst of nitrogen-doped nickel-iron oxyhydroxide derived from waste rusty iron foam is synthesized via an in situ ?waste-to-value? synthetic route followed by an ammonia/argon plasma treatment, which reconstructs the surface of the catalyst to a 3D nanosheetlike porous network with abundant oxygen vacancies. The as-prepared catalyst shows a small potential of 1.45 V vs. RHE at 500 mA cm? 2 for urea oxidation. Overall water-urea electrolysis only requires 1.58 V to deliver 100 mA cm-2, which is 0.33 V less than that in urea-free water splitting, and thus lowers the overall energy consumption by 17.3%. Without oxygen evolution, the hybrid electrolysis does not suffer from the safety hazard caused by explosive hydrogen?oxygen mixture. We demonstrate the safe production of green hydrogen (3.1% oxygen in the gaseous product) in the hybrid electrolysis powered by solar energy via a photovoltaic panel. Our work provides a method to address the urea-caused environmental issues and simultaneously generate green hydrogen safely using solar energy.					sun, zixu/GYE-3224-2022; Yao, Mengqi/ABE-1430-2020; Hong, Wei/L-5811-2017; Li, Hong/AAG-2445-2020; Koh, See Wee/O-2212-2017; Chen, Zhong/A-2244-2011	Yao, Mengqi/0000-0002-7660-1940; Hong, Wei/0000-0003-2509-7614; Koh, See Wee/0000-0003-1592-2190; Chen, Zhong/0000-0001-7518-1414													1385-8947	1873-3212				JUN 15	2021	414								128753	10.1016/j.cej.2021.128753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.128753		FEB 2021											WOS:000641375700003

Using this method, no metal catalysts were used. During electrolysis, a nitrogen radical was formed at the urea substrate that cyclised with the alkene and generated a terminal carbon radical which further formed a bond with the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl radical (TEMPO). This method of electrolysis not only gives cyclic ureas but also functionalises terminal unactivated alkenes. This method can be considered to be environmentally friendly given that it avoids the issues of toxicity or complicated metal ligands and could therefore be potentially employed in green chemistry.

Unfortunately, the source of high catalytic activity in state-of-the-art doped nickel catalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity remains poorly understood, hindering the rational design of new catalyst materials. In particular, the exact role of cobalt as a dopant in Ni(OH)(2) to maximize the intrinsic activity towards UOR remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate how tuning the Ni:Co ratio allows us to control the intrinsic activity and number of active surface sites, both of which contribute towards increasing UOR performance. We show how Ni90Co10(OH)(2) achieves the largest geometric current density due to the increase of available surface sites and that intrinsic activity towards UOR is maximized with Ni20Co80(OH)(2). Through density functional theory calculations, we show that the introduction of Co alters the Ni 3d electronic state density distribution to lower the minimum energy required to oxidize Ni and influence potential surface adsorbate interactions.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) poses a challenge in conventional overall water electrolysis due to its slow thermodynamically process. Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers an alternative anodic oxidation method that is highly efficient and cost-effective, with favorable thermodynamics and sustainability. Recently, there has been limited research on bifunctional catalysts that exhibit excellent activity for both OER and UOR reactions. In this study, we developed a selenium and iron co-doped nickel sulfide (SeFe-Ni3S2) catalyst that demonstrated excellent Tafel slopes of 53.9 mV dec -1 and 16.4 mV dec -1 for OER and UOR, respectively. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the introduction of metal (iron) and nonmetallic elements (selenium) was found to coordinate the d -band center, resulting in improved adsorption/desorption energies of the catalysts and reduced the overpotentials and limiting potentials for OER and UOR, respectively. This activity enhancement can be attributed to the altered electronic coordination structure after the introduction of selenium (Se) and iron (Fe), leading to an increase in the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. This work offers a new strategy for bifunctional catalysts for OER and UOR, presenting new possibilities for the future development of hydrogen production and novel energy conversion technologies. It contributes towards the urgent search for technologies that efficiently produce green hydrogen energy, providing potential solutions to mitigate the energy crisis and protect the environment.					fan, jc/JEF-2974-2023; Cui, Xiaoqiang/JFK-6067-2023; zheng, weitao/HCH-5112-2022	Cui, Xiaoqiang/0000-0002-5858-6257; zheng, weitao/0000-0002-9028-278X													0021-9797	1095-7103				OCT	2024	671						46	55		10.1016/j.jcis.2024.05.155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.05.155		MAY 2024						38788423					WOS:001246294000001

The synthesized NiCoB@C catalyst exhibited porous and partially amorphous metallic structure depending on its composition, as analysed by XRD, XPS, and TEM; thus, NiCoB@C catalyst showed a high catalytic activity for urea oxidation reaction as well as hydrogen evolution reaction. The required cell voltage in the electrolysis cell with NiCoB@C as anode and cathode was as low as 1.34 V for the current densities 10 mA cm(-2). Similar performance of the urea electrolysis for H-2 production using 0.33 M urea and a fresh urine in 1 M KOH was observed.

However, its practical application requires catalysts with sufficient durability and high-strength reactant/product diffusion capability under large current densities. Herein, the Co0.5NiS2-Ni3S2 coral-like nanorods (Co0.5NiS2-Ni3S2/NF) of electronic structure and morphology regulation are rationally constructed. The heterostructure and sulfur vacancies induce interfacial charge redistribution, thus promoting the adsorption of urea and *OH intermediates, accompanied by accelerating the dissociation of H2O. Moreover, the hierarchical nanorod structure ensures mass transfer and gas product rapid escape. As a result, Co0.5NiS2-Ni3S2/NF only takes 1.45 V and -345 mV to reach large current densities of +/- 1500 mA cm(-2) for the UOR and HER, respectively. Notably, the overall urea electrolysis system needs only 2.00 V to obtain 1500 mA cm(-2), and it can operate stably for 120 h at 500 mA cm(-2). This work illustrates the importance of regulating the adsorption energy of intermediates to design advanced catalysts for energy-efficient H-2 production from urea electrolysis.

Herein, a hollow spherical LaNiO3 perovskite (LNO-H) was prepared by a hydrothermal method for ORR/UOR, UZAB and urea splitting. The LNO-H exhibited excellent performances for UOR in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea (Ej10 = 1.41 V vs RHE) and ORR in 1 M KOH (E1/2 = 0.80 V vs RHE). Moreover, the LNO-H-based UZAB showed a remarkable cycling stability over 2100 h (6300 cycles) at 2 mA cm-2. In particular, the failure mechanisms of LNO-H-based UZAB were systematically investigated by analyzing the air cathode, Zn anode and the electrolyte. The failure of LNOH-based UZAB at 2 mA cm-2 was mainly attributed to the formation of ZnO on the air electrode. Furthermore, K2CO3 on the surfaces of air electrode via the reaction of OH- with CO2 was the crucial factor for the battery failure at 10 mA cm-2. Besides, LNO-H-based urea splitting required 1.42 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2.

In the present work, considering Co-Ni hexacyanoferrate (CoxNi1-xHCF) as a PBA, CoxNi1-xHCF nanocuboids with different Co and Ni compositions were synthesized on Ni foam (NF) by hydrothermal synthesis. Further, their application toward OER and UOR catalytic activity was studied. The synthesized CoxNi1-xHCF:NF composites with high catalytic activity and conductivity exhibited superior catalytic performance for the OERs and UORs. The CoxNi1-xHCF:NF composite electrodes exhibited a lower overpotential (eta) of 334 mV with a lower Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) for the OER catalytic activity and a lower potential of 1.38 V with a lower Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) for the UOR catalytic activity. It was observed that low charge transfer resistance, high electrochemically active surface area, and availability of Co3+ ions are major factors contributing to the OER activity. The presence of oxidative Ni2+ species contributed significantly to the UOR activity. Overall, the present study elucidates the binder-free CoxNi1-xHCF:NF electrodes as stable and high-performance OER and UOR catalysts and provides pathways for designing advanced PBA catalysts.

Electric energy is mainly consumed by the sluggish anodic oxy-gen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been regarded as a promising reaction to replace OER because of its small thermodynamic oxidation potential. However, developing a facile and large-scale preparation method for bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR electrocatalysts is still challenging. Herein, phosphate-modified (4.46 atomic%) NiMoO4-x net-like nanostructures are formed on Ni foam (NF) via H3PMo12O40 etching strategy at room temperature (denoted as NF/P-NiMoO4-x). The etched NF can directly serve as HER electrode, and delivers overpotential of 116 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with Tafel slope of 77.5 mV/dec. Furthermore, it displays excellent UOR activity with potential of 1.359 V at current density of 10 mA/ cm(2) and Tafel slope of 19.3 mV/dec. The apparent activation energy of NF/P-NiMoO4-x is 20.6 kJ/mol, lower than that of NF (37.7 kJ/mol), indicating smaller apparent barrier for CAN bond cleavage in urea. The cell voltage of urea electrolysis is around 1.48 V for H-2 production to deliver current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and better long-term stability for 50 h than that of Ir/C||Pt/C. The etching solution can be recycled for five times by addition of H2O2, turning heteropoly blue into its original state. This work develops a facile and large-scale method to prepare bifunctional HER and UOR electrocatalysts for H-2 pro-duction in a less-energy saving way via urea electrolysis. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Developing efficient electrocatalysts for UOR becomes a central challenge. Recently, amorphous materials have been extensively used as UOR catalysts because of their numerous defective sites and flexible electronic properties. In this review, recent advancements in the development of amorphous UOR electrocatalysts are analyzed. The UOR mechanism is discussed, and the design of amorphous catalysts is then analyzed. The main catalyst design strategies are illustrated, including nanostructure control, heteroatom doping, composition regulation, and heterostructure construction. Also, electrocatalysts' structureperformance correlation is interpreted. Perspectives in this field are proposed for guiding future studies on the development of high-performance amorphous catalysts towards energy sustainability.

Here, a rational design architecture consisting of Ni2P nanoparticles embedded in P-doped carbonized wood fibers (Ni2P/PCWF) is synthesized by simultaneous carbonization and phosphorization. A syn-ergistic enhancement effect between electronic structure manipulation and interface regulation is observed in Ni2P/PCWF during the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). First, the P doping of carbon can optimize the electronic structure of Ni2P/PCWF. Second, the charge transport process is aided by the Ni2P nanoparticles embedded in the PCWF. Lastly, elec-tron transfer can be accelerated by the in-situ formed heterogeneous interface between metal phosphides and metal hydroxides (hydroxyl oxides). Due to the synergy of the structural and electrical modulation, Ni2P/PCWF exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic properties toward the UOR under alkaline conditions. It only requires 1.34 V (us. RHE) to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2, and the increase in potential at 10 mA cm-2 for 70 h is insignificant (z2.9%).

However, it is challenging due to the competitive oxygen evolution reaction under a high current density (e.g., >300 mA cm(-2)), which reduces the anode electrocatalyst's activity and stability. Herein, taking lower energy cost urea electrooxidation reaction as the model reaction, we developed oxyanion-engineered Nickel catalysts to inhibit competing oxygen evolution reaction during urea oxidation reaction, achieving an ultrahigh 323.4 mA cm(-2) current density at 1.65 V with 99.3 +/- 0.4% selectivity of N-products. In situ spectra studies reveal that such in situ generated oxyanions not only inhibit OH- adsorption and guarantee high coverage of urea reactant on active sites to avoid oxygen evolution reaction, but also accelerate urea's C - N bond cleavage to form CNO- intermediates for facilitating urea oxidation reaction. Accordingly, a comprehensive mechanism for competitive adsorption behaviour between OH(- )and urea to boost urea electrooxidation and dynamic change of Ni active sites during urea oxidation reaction was proposed. This work presents a feasible route for high-efficiency urea electrooxidation reaction and even various electrooxidation reactions in practical applications.

In this work, an interface engineering strategy is applied to build the CoS2/MoS2/Ni3S2/NF electrode with nanoflowers morphology via a simple hydrothermal method. The hierarchical interfaces can drive electron reconstruction to acquire abundant high-valence Ni active species, which significantly accelerate the OER and UOR. Consequently, the prepared CoS2/MoS2/Ni3S2/NF electrode only needs the low potential of 1.30 and 1.43 V vs RHE to reach 10 mA cm-2 for UOR and OER, respectively. Furthermore, the CoS2/MoS2/Ni3S2/NF electrode can work stable over 100 h for both OER and UOR at the high current density of 100 mA cm-2. This work provides a simple method to fabricate hierarchical interfaces as highly efficient OER and UOR electrocatalysts.

Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalyst with heterostructures is developed via phosphating and NaBH4 pretreatment of the pristine ZIF-L for overall water splitting and urea oxidation. The as-prepared CoBOx/NiCoP catalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance with only overpotentials of 100, 283 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to reach the current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and the low potential of 1.35 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Theoretical calculations show that the construction of amorphous/crystalline heterostructure can accelerate the charge transfer between the active site and intermediate, thus enhance the intermediates adsorption and reduce the kinetic barrier toward HER/OER process for enhancing electrocatalytic activity. Importantly, the in-situ Raman spectroscopy discloses that the rapid formation of oxidation-state transition metal oxyhydroxide species would provide more active sites for the oxidation reaction. This multiple electrocatalysis demonstrates the great potential of amorphous/crystalline heterogeneous interfaces for high-performing electrocatalytic conversions.

To address issues such as dehydrogenation, C-N bond breakage, and catalyst poisoning caused by carbonaceous fragments simultaneously, manipulating a pathway via building a multi-synergistic system is essential. Therefore, we constructed a Co, V co-doped NiS2 ternary collaborative system to achieve energy-saving urea electrooxidation with an emphasis on catalytic mechanism investigation. The optimal ternary catalyst exhibited good urea electrooxidation activity (77 mA cm(-2) at 1.5 V vs RHE), stability, and hydrogen production (143 L min(-1) g(cat)(-1) at 1.8 V vs RHE). Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy, an in situ electrochemical mass spectrometry isotope tracing experiment, and the density functional theory study, the roles of Ni, Co, and V elements were clearly revealed. The extended superexchange interaction not only enhanced the electron transmission capacity between Ni and S but also accelerated the electron transfer between urea and the catalyst. Anti-CO poisoning experiments indicated that the existence of Co can accelerate the oxidation of carbonaceous intermediate products and improve the catalyst stability. More importantly, we found that N-2 was formed through the urea intermolecular N-N coupling process under the catalysis of metal sulfide. The strategy and mechanism proposed herein give a deeper understanding of UOR catalyzed by metal sulfides.					hu, Wenping/B-5957-2013; Song, Yajun/GQQ-0476-2022														2155-5435					JAN 7	2022	12	1					569	579		10.1021/acscatal.1c05190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.1c05190		DEC 2021											WOS:000735960000001

The introduction of transition metals is a strategy to solve these problems, but systematic investigations of mechanisms are limited. Herein, a range of isoelectronic transition metals (ITMs) (M = Co, Fe, and Cu) doped Ni(OH)(2) catalysts on UOR are studied simultaneously in theory and experiment. By introducing Co and Fe into the lattice of Ni(OH)(2), electronic structure transfer is facilitated, resulting in effective promotion of the urea absorption and CO2 desorption, and intrinsic activity can be increased. Among these catalysts, Co-Ni(OH)(2) with the lowest energy barrier (1.76 eV) for rate-determining steps might exhibit excellent activity. To verify the theoretical prediction, samples are synthesized via the one-step hydrothermal method. ITMs incorporation can stabilize the alpha phase of Ni(OH)(2), confirmed by chronopotentiometry and X-ray diffraction results. Agreeing with the calculation, Co-Ni(OH)(2) manifests superior UOR properties than other catalysts, providing the smallest onset potential (1.304 V vs RHE) and Tafel slope (24 mV dec(-1)). This study can provide a comprehensive understanding of the ITMs-Ni(OH)(2) catalytic on UOR mechanism, which could be instructive for designing UOR catalysts with higher activity.

However, UOR faces challenges like slow kinetics, high energy barriers, and a complex mechanism, necessitating the development of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a rapid method is proposed for synthesizing Mo-doped Ni/NiO (Ni/MNO) nanocomposite as a highly effective UOR electrocatalyst. Mo doping oxidizes Ni2+ to Ni3+, creating abundant active sites for UOR. The Ni/MNO catalyst exhibits remarkable activity for both OER and UOR due to Mo doping, structural modulation, increased active sites, and the presence of Ni3+ ions. Optimized Ni/MNO-10 shows a low OER overpotential of 280 mV and a UOR working potential of 1.37 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at 10 mA cm-2, with exceptional stability over 12 h of continuous electrolysis. Notably, urea-assisted water splitting requires only 1.45 V for 10 mA cm-2, significantly less than the overall water splitting voltage (1.65 V), indicating energy-efficient hydrogen production. Moreover, the Ni/MNO catalyst exhibits outstanding long-term stability. This work presents a rapid and effective approach to synthesizing cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for clean energy production and wastewater treatment. Mo-doped Ni/NiO nanocomposite by a pulsed laser technique is developed. The optimized nanocomposite exhibits excellent urea oxidation reaction performance with a working potential of 1.37 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at 10 mA cm-2 and exceptional stability. Remarkably, using this nanocomposite for urea-assisted water splitting only needs 1.45 V at 10 mA cm-2, demonstrating its energy-efficient hydrogen production.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH					Raja Arumugam, Senthil/M-7372-2017	Raja Arumugam, Senthil/0000-0001-9268-171X; , Maheskumar/0000-0003-3021-1135														2688-4062				DEC	2023	4	12								10.1002/sstr.202300212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sstr.202300212		SEP 2023											WOS:001057443700001

Herein, a hybridization of ZIF-67-derived CoP nanoparticles embedded in P, N co-doped carbon matrix (PNC) and anchored on P-doped carbonized wood fibers (PCWF) is constructed using a simple simultaneous phosphorization and carbonization strategy. Benefiting from the optimized surface/interface electronic structures, abundant exposed active sites, and outstanding conductivity, the CoP@PNC/PCWF can drive the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with greater activity and better stability than most recently reported electrocatalysts, in which a potential as low as 1.32 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) is needed to reach 50 mA cm(-2) and shows excellent durability. Furthermore, for overall urea splitting, using the CoP@PNC/PCWF electrocatalyst as the anode and commercial Pt/C supported on nickel foam as the cathode, an ultralow cell voltage of 1.50 V (vs RHE) is expected to achieve the 50 mA cm(-2) and operate continuously for more than 50 h at 20 mA cm(-2).

Modifying local pH for efficient urea electro-oxidation in neutral media on nickel	CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE												Chemical processes requiring alkaline environments often include caustic additives for reactant streams and neutralization of product streams. The urea electro-oxidati on reaction in wastewater must be neutralized before products can be safely discharged, creating a systems-level burden. This work demonstrates that performing the hydrogen evolution reaction on electrodes co-located with urea electro-oxidation reaction electrodes controllably raises the pH locally, including at the urea oxidation surface. Using a custom rotating ring-disc electrode, the pH at a Ni-ring is manipulated electrochemically through the hydrogen evolution reaction current and rotation rate. The urea electro-oxidation reaction on the Ni-ring shows similar activity to a pH 11.5 solution despite being bulk pH of 7.4-7.7. Interdigitated Ni/Pt electrode arrays, employing diffusion for mass transport, show a 3-decade pH change on the Ni surface, allowing 4.5 mA/cm2 urea electro-oxidation reaction in bulk-neutral conditions. Electrochemically modifying the local pH presents a path forward for greener processes without the need for additional costly operations.																				2666-3864				NOV 20	2024	5	11							102249	10.1016/j.xcrp.2024.102249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2024.102249		NOV 2024											WOS:001361950100001

Therefore, a more easily oxidized urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been implemented to replace OER. Co-Mo-based bimetallic oxides have been recognized as interesting candidates for electrocatalytic water splitting due to their unique d electron configurations, but the low conductivity and limited active sites still hinder their development. Herein, we demonstrated that anion-modulation in CoMoO4 nanoplates as coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR for convenient and efficient urea-assisted hydrogen-production system are demonstrated. The findings of the experiments show that nitrogen doping and phosphorus doping exhibit excellent activity toward alkaline HER and UOR, respectively.

However, the UOR with six-electron transfer process is also slow and complex, which needs catalysts to reduce its overvoltage. In this paper, inspired by the structure of urease in organisms a N-doped NiO heterogeneous biomimetic catalytic electrode was designed for UOR. The N-NiO biomimetic catalytic electrode was prepared by a two-step method. By equipping N-NiO as both anode and cathode, the electrode potential was only 1.55 V at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in urea assisted water electrolysis which is much lower that in water electrolysis., indicating its potential for the application.

Thus, modulating the surface electron density of electrocatalysts is an effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic activity of targeted reactions. Herein, the NiSe2/FeSe2 p-p heterojunction is constructed via a simple selenization method for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The designed NiSe2/FeSe2 electrocatalyst exhibits a superior activity towards OER, which only requires a low overpotential of 256 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and surpasses other selenides and even the state-of-the-art RuO2. Impressively, when employed as the UOR electrode, the NiSe2/FeSe2 heterojunction needs only 127 mV overpotential at 50 mA cm(-2), remarkably superior to other selenides and confirming the less energy consumption for UOR. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the well-designed built-in electric field at the heterointerface of NiSe2/FeSe2 p-p heterojunction due to the difference of energy levels can expedite the charge transfer and thus strengthen the conductivity of heterojunction electrocatalyst. Moreover, the self-driven electron transfer across the NiSe2/FeSe2 heterointerface can induce local charge redistribution at the interface region, which is beneficial for the adsorption of OH- and urea owing to the electrostatic interaction. Therefore, the designed NiSe2/FeSe2 p-p heterojunction with regulated electronic structure displays extraordinary electrocatalytic activity for both the OER and UOR. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to manipulate the surface/interface charge states of electrocatalysts for improving the catalytic activity of OER and UOR, and provides new guidelines for exploring other superior electrocatalysts.					yu, jiemiao/H-1005-2016; xu, zihao/JDM-7099-2023	Ni, Shan/0000-0002-7347-5985													0926-3373	1873-3883				DEC 15	2021	299								120638	10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120638		AUG 2021											WOS:000703890500005

The ability to use urea reaction of oxidation (UOR) in place of the oxygen/hydrogen evolution process (OER/HER) during water splitting is a significant step toward the production of high-purity hydrogen with less energy usage. Empirical evidence suggests that the UOR process consists of two stages. First, the metal sites undergo an electrochemical pre-oxidation reaction, and then the urea molecules on the high-valence metal sites are chemically oxidized. Here, the use of scandium-doped CoTe supported on carbon nanotubes called Sc@CoTe/CNT is reported and CoTe/CNT as a composite to efficiently promote hydrogen generation from highly durable and active electrocatalysts for the OER/UOR/HER in urea and alkali solutions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates that the UOR facilitates charge transfer across the interface. Furthermore, the Sc@CoTe/CNT nanocatalyst has high performance in KOH and KOH-containing urea solutions as demonstrated by the HER, OER, and UOR (215 mV, 1.59, and 1.31 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH) and CoTe/CNT shows 195 mV, 1.61 and 1.3 V, respectively. Consequently, the total urea splitting system achieves 1.29 V, whereas the overall water splitting device obtaines 1.49 V of Sc@CoTe/CNT and CoTe/CNT shows 1.54, 1.48 V, respectively. This work presents a viable method of combining HER with UOR for maximally effective hydrogen production.

On the other hand, hydrazine/urea could potentially serve as a new type of fuel. However, at present, this remains a considerable challenge. The development of a low-cost, highly efficient, and stable electrocatalyst stands as a prerequisite for achieving this goal. In this study, a novel Ni 2 P/CoP 3 -Zn vac bimetallic phosphide catalyst is designed and constructed using a hydrothermal-alkali etching-phosphating three -step method. This catalyst integrates P -rich CoP 3 , P -poor metallic Ni 2 P, and abundant Zn 2+ cation vacancies into a single structure for HzOR/UOR. Copious P in CoP 3 provides a wealth of negative electrons, which aids in the adsorption of positive reactive intermediates. Meanwhile, P -poor metallic Ni 2 P exhibits excellent electrical conductivity, ensuring rapid reaction dynamics. Both physical and electrochemical experiments confirm the successful creation of the Ni 2 P/CoP 3 -Zn vac heterojunction, along with the distinctive electron structure of Ni 2 P and CoP 3 . Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results validate the presence of cation vacancies, which significantly enhance the density of active sites. Consequently, this innovative Ni 2 P/CoP 3 -Zn vac heterojunction catalyst displays remarkable electrocatalytic activity, achieving a potential of -47 mV/1.311 V to attain 10 mA center dot cm -2 for HzOR and UOR, respectively. The Tafel slopes of 54.3 and 37.24 mV center dot dec -1 for HzOR and UOR are significantly smaller than those of single -phased Ni 2 P and CoP 3 , as well as the two -phased phosphide without alkali etching. Building upon the excellent HzOR/UOR performance of the Ni 2 P/CoP 3 -Zn vac heterojunction, a two -electrode cell for direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHzFC) and direct urea -hydrogen peroxide fuel cells (DUHPFC) is assembled with a Ni 2 P/CoP 3 -Zn vac anode. This configuration demonstrates a maximum power density of 229.01 mW center dot cm -2 for DHzFC and 16.22 mW center dot cm -2 for DUHPFC. Moreover, both DHzFC and DUHPFC exhibit exceptional stability for up to 24 h. A homemade aqueous Zn-Hz battery, equipped with a Ni 2 P/CoP 3 -Zn vac cathode, further demonstrates its practicality for energy conversion. This work underscores a promising avenue for developing costeffective and highly stable solutions for UOR and HzOR.

Imidazolium-urea low transition temperature mixtures for the UHP-promoted oxidation of boron compounds	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS												Different carboxy-functionalized imidazolium salts have been considered as components of low transition temperature mixtures (LTTMs) in combination with urea. Among them, a novel LTTM based on 1-(methoxycarbonyl)methyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and urea has been prepared and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry throughout its entire composition range. This LTTM has been employed for the oxidation of boron reagents using urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct (UHP) as the oxidizer, thus avoiding the use of aqueous H2O2, which is dangerous to handle. This metal-free protocol affords the corresponding alcohols in good to quantitative yields in up to 5 mmol scale without the need of further purification. The broad composition range of the LTTM allows for the reaction to be carried out up to three consecutive times with a single imidazolium salt loading offering remarkable sustainability with an E-factor of 7.9, which can be reduced to 3.2 by the threefold reuse of the system.

Replacing OER with urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with low thermodynamic potential can simultaneously improve the energy efficiency of H-2 production and purify urea-containing wastewater. Here we report a facile assembly-calcination two-step method to synthesize heterogeneous Ni-MoN nanosheet-assembled microspheres (Ni-MoN NAMs). The nanosheet-assembled structure and the synergistic metallic Ni-MoN heterogeneous interface endow the Ni-MoN NAMs with good OER (1.52 V@10 mA cm(-2)), UOR (1.28 V@10 mA cm(-2)), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 0.16 V@10 mA cm(-2)) activity. The two-electrode urea electrolysis cell with Ni-MoN NAMs as both the cathode and anode requires an extremely low cell voltage of 1.41 V to afford 20 mA cm(-2), which is 0.3 V lower than that of the water electrolyzer, paving the way for energy-saving H-2 production.

James; Roberts, Gretel Silyn; Baroutian, Saeid			A critical review on current urea removal technologies from water: An approach for pollution prevention and resource recovery	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY												Urea is the key nitrogenous waste product generated in the urea cycle in ureotelic animals. Apart from that, urea and its derivatives are manufactured on a large scale for various industrial and agricultural purposes. Due to these sources, urea contamination is reported across various industries. However, since the scale and nature of these industries vary, urea contamination level within these contexts differs accordingly. Among the available urea removal methods for contaminated water, only a few technologies have been applied in real-world situa-tions, and the majority are still at the laboratory scale. Hence, selecting suitable remediation technology for an existing or novel context should be based on a critical evaluation of all the existing technologies. Moreover, moving towards sustainable practices, urea removal from contaminated water simultaneously provides water and nutrient recovery opportunities. Hence, this review critically assesses all the available urea removal tech-nologies, including adsorption, hydrolysis, advanced oxidation, membrane separation, and biological removal, in terms of urea removal mechanisms, applied technologies, and advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, in-sights into future urea removal research and resource recovery are also presented.

J	Yoon, J; Yoon, YS; Kim, DJ				Yoon, Jaesik; Yoon, Young Soo; Kim, Dong-Joo			Silver-Nanoparticle-Decorated NiOOH Nanorods for Electrocatalytic Urea Sensing	ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS												Nickel (Ni)-based urea biosensors have been proven to be a useful prescreening technology because of their excellent electrocatalyst activities on urea. However, the behavior of Ni-based nonenzymatic urea biosensors showed limitations in identifying the presence of urea molecules in biomarkers such as urine and serum because the catalytic response of the Ni element is only applicable to an alkaline or OH- environment. To use Ni-based catalysts as urea biosensors in a physiological situation, pH-independent functioning for urea electrooxidation is necessary. This paper presents Ni-based catalysts that exhibit electrocatalytic activity toward urea oxidation reaction in a neutral pH environment. The silver (Ag)/NiOOH nanorod composite catalysts were prepared by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment of the Ni(OH)(2) precursor and sputter deposition of Ag. Their properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Good electrochemical performances by CV and chronoamperometry showed a high sensitivity of 233.7 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), a wide linear range of 0.2-26.0 mM, a fast response time of approximately 3.0 s, and a detection limit of 5.0 mu M (S/N = 3) at an applied potential of 0.35 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in a neutral phosphate-buffered saline solution. The performances of the new electrochemical electrode provide a promising platform to distinguish the presence of urea in human serum via nonenzymatic routes.

Herein, quaternary electrocatalyst characterized by abundant interfaces supported on carbon cloth (denoted as Mo-Co-S-Se/CC) is designed through a facile solvothermal and post-low-temperature selenylation process, which delivers excellent catalytic performances in HER, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in alkaline electrolyte. Benefiting from the rich interfaces, the designed catalyst delivers current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) with low overpotentials of 58 and 167 mV, respectively, and small Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1) for HER. For the anodic OER, only 350 mV overpotential is needed to drive 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, Mo-Co-S-Se/CC also presents remarkable catalytic activity for UOR in 1 M KOH solution, which provides another way to substitute the sluggish OER to reduce the cost of hydrogen production. As a proof of concept, overall water-splitting tests are measured with Mo-Co-S-Se/CC as both anode and cathode, respectively, in 1 M KOH solution with 0.5 M urea; only 1.4 V is required to drive 10 mA cm(-2), much lower than that for urea-free electrolyte with 1.62 V.

The present research work focusses on the use of electrochemically modified steel mesh (SM) extracted from discarded nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries for the application of energy generation. Upon deposition of amorphous nickel selenide film on SM, significant activity towards catalysing the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is reported. Electrodeposition of Nickel selenide on SM was confirmed by analytical techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and EDX studies. Electrochemical studies reveal that for NiSe@SM a potential of 1.375 V vs RHE is needed to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is significantly higher than the noble metal-based mixed metal oxide (MMO) catalyst. Further, the NiSe@SM showed minimum Tafel slope of 47 mV dec-1 and exhibited minimum charge transfer resistance among all the tested films. Furthermore, the film showed stability of 9 h confirming the robustness of catalyst. The findings indicate that the inclusion of Selenium led to an improvement in the activity and kinetics of the UOR.

Moreover, a range of kinetic characteristics parameters were computed, such as the diffusion coefficient, Tafel slope, and transfer coefficient.

J	Wang, YH; Li, XY; Du, XQ; Zhang, XS				Wang, Yanhong; Li, Xinyu; Du, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Xiaoshuang			Modulation of the electronic structure of Co2P by Mo, Fe co-doping for efficient urea electrolysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												Hydrogen production by urea splitting not only plays an energy-saving role in the production of hydrogen energy, but also can purify wastewater containing urea, which has great advantages compared with hydrogen production by water splitting. In this study, Mo, Fe co-doped bifunctional Co2P electrodes were prepared through hydrothermal and moderate-temperature phosphating methods. Under the synergistic effect of bimetallic cations, the electronic structure of Co2P is effectively modulated, thus showing excellent electrochemistry performance in urea splitting. In the electrolyte solution of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, the potential of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is 1.26V, 1.316 V and 1.336V for driving current density of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm-2, and the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is 194 mV, 244 mV and 268 mV for driving current density of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm-2. The overall urea electrolysis only requires a voltage of 1.415 V and 1.686 V to drive a current density of 10 and 50 mA cm-2, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported to date. The experimental results show that the increased activity is assigned to the rapid charge transfer, the exposure of more active sites and the improved conductivity due to the doping of bimetallic ions. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that the prepared Mo, Fe co-doped Co2P electrodes has the smallest Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption compared with Fe co-doped Co2P electrodes.

In this report, for the first time, we demonstrate that the UOR activity of Ni5P4 is improved via V incorporation. The novel amorphous V-doped Ni5P4 (V10%-Ni5P4) microflower structure with optimized electronic structure was prepared by a solvothermal-phosphorization process. With V atoms involved, the V10%-Ni5P4 microflowers are assembled by much thinner, denser nanosheet units compared with the Ni5P4 counterpart, which endows it with more active sites, enhanced mass transfer, conductivity, and better wettability. The V10%-Ni5P4 microflowers exhibit outstanding UOR activity of 282 mA cm-2 at 1.6 V vs RHE with a low Tafel slope (36.1 mV dec-1). Furthermore, the urea-assisted electrolytic cell only needs 1.44 V to provide 50 mA cm-2 and the urea-assisted rechargeable Zn-Air battery (uZAB) is illustrated to have a higher open-circuit voltage of 1.43 V and possesses a lower potential gap than that Pt/Ir-based uZABs. This report sheds light on the role of vanadium in crystallization and structure optimization and lays the foundation for developing new UOR electrocatalysts.

Oxidation of urea-derived nitrogen by thaumarchaeota-dominated marine nitrifying communities	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Urea nitrogen has been proposed to contribute significantly to nitrification by marine thaumarchaeotes. These inferences are based on distributions of thaumarchaeote urease genes rather than activity measurements. We found that ammonia oxidation rates were always higher than oxidation rates of urea-derived N in samples from coastal Georgia, USA (means +/- SEM: 382 +/- 35 versus 73 +/- 24 nmolL(-1)d(-1), Mann-Whitney U-test p<0.0001), and the South Atlantic Bight (20 +/- 8.8 versus 2.2 +/- 1.7 nmolL(-1)d(-1), p=0.026) but not the Gulf of Alaska (8.8 +/- 4.0 versus 1.5 +/- 0.6, p>0.05). Urea-derived N was relatively more important in samples from Antarctic continental shelf waters, though the difference was not statistically significant (19.4 +/- 4.8 versus 12.0 +/- 2.7 nmolL(-1)d(-1), p>0.05). We found only weak correlations between oxidation rates of urea-derived N and the abundance or transcription of putative Thaumarchaeota ureC genes. Dependence on urea-derived N does not appear to be directly related to pH or ammonium concentrations. Competition experiments and release of (NH3)-N-15 suggest that urea is hydrolyzed to ammonia intracellularly, then a portion is lost to the dissolved pool. The contribution of urea-derived N to nitrification appears to be minor in temperate coastal waters, but may represent a significant portion of the nitrification flux in Antarctic coastal waters.

The basic characteristics of resins including solid content, viscosity, and curing time were studied, and the dry and wet bond strengths were evaluated by producing a three layer plywood. Additionally, the curing characteristics of different resins were investigated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Structural distributions between UF and oxidized cassava starch were examined via FT-IR and C-13 NMR analysis. The results indicated that the addition of oxidized starch not only improved resin bond strength but also notably reduced the curing start temperature of modified resins. Furthermore, a negative relationship between F/U mole ratio and the extent of reduction was identified. The structural distribution of UF resins changed dramatically because of oxidation cassava starch addition, but the changes varied due to different F/U mole ratios.

In this work, the Cu(OH)(2) nanowire arrays directly supported on copper foam are synthesized via a facile in-situ etching technique. The one-dimension nanowire structure with abundant meso-porous endows Cu(OH)(2) catalyst with considerable exposing active sites for the catalytic reaction. Additionally, the active substance directly grown on current collector without binder using can enhance conductivity and accelerate the charge transport. Beneficial from the above merits, the as-obtained Cu(OH)(2) exhibits outstanding UOR performance with a potential of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2), lower than 1.62 V for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), small Tafel slopes of 86 mV dec(-1), and good long-term stability.

The discharge of wastewater rich in urea causes serious harm to the environment and human health. Urea electrooxidation technology is an important means to remove urea pollutants, which has the dual significance of environmental protection and clean energy production. However, the kinetics of urea oxidation is slow, so it is urgent to develop efficient catalysts for urea electrooxidation. In recent years, nickel-based materials as effective catalysts for urea electrooxidation have been favored by researchers because of their low cost, high activity, and high stability. Suitable support can significantly improve the catalytic performance of electrocatalyst. In this paper, the research progress of supported nickel-based catalysts in the field of urea electrooxidation was reviewed, and the applications of supported nickel-based catalysts in urea electrolysis hydrogen production, fuel cells, and urea sensors were reviewed in detail. The development prospect, challenges, and practical applications of supported nickel-based catalysts are discussed.																			0947-7047	1862-0760				AUG	2023	29	8					2969	2987	s11581-023-05107-7	10.1007/s11581-023-05107-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11581-023-05107-7		JUL 2023											WOS:001025718900002

Herein, the morphology and electronic structure of cobalt metaphosphate (Co2P4O12) by vanadium (V) doping, resulting in improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are simultaneously regulated. Theory calculations show that V-doped Co2P4O12 (V-Co2P4O12) can boost the kinetics of catalytic reactions by optimizing the d-band center of Co atoms and the binding strength of intermediates, as well as enhancing the density of states. Moreover, the doping of V into Co2P4O12 crystalline structure benefits the formation of a thicker amorphous layer during the catalytic process, which could enhance its alkaline corrosion resistance and stability. Additionally, the multilevel nanostructures of V-Co2P4O12 provide rich active sites for catalytic reactions. As a result, a two-electrode electrolyzer assembled by V-doped Co2P4O12 delivers low voltages for overall water and urea splitting. The superior performance suggests that the proposed V-doping strategy is a promising way to regulate electrocatalytic activity for catering to green electrocatalytic applications. The morphology and electronic structure of the Co2P4O12 catalyst are simultaneously regulated by V doping, which endows the catalyst with enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance. Thanks to the excellent trifunctional catalytic performance, the assembled two-electrode electrolyzers enable efficient overall water and urea splitting at low overpotentials.image					Zhang, Shanqing/C-2590-2008														1616-301X	1616-3028				MAY	2024	34	21								10.1002/adfm.202313974	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202313974		JAN 2024											WOS:001149796100001

The present work focuses on synthesizing mixed transition metal oxide (MMO) nanostructures composed of nickel rich nickel cobaltite electrode materials. Interesting, cobalt rich nickel cobaltite have been widely studied; however, the nickel -rich nickel cobaltite remains relatively unexplored. For stabilization of nickel rich nickel cobaltite, we have designed a process for synthesizing threedimensional (3D) Ni-Co oxalate as a precursor via the coprecipitation method using diammonium oxalate monohydrate as a precipitating agent. The as obtained precursor was further subjected to thermal decomposition which results in the formation of Ni 2 CoO 4 . Microstructural analysis of Ni-Co oxalate indicates that oxalateassisted synthesis leads to anisotropic ultrafine nanoparticle growth, forming hierarchically arranged 3D microflowers. Interestingly, the use of NaOH as a precipitating agent induces a significant change in the morphology of Ni 2 CoO 4 , (nanoparticles). Furthermore, the effect of morphology changes over the electrochemical performance was investigated. Ni 2 CoO 4 microflower demonstrates an overpotential of 330 mV@25 mA/cm 2 for O 2 and -190 mV@10 mA/cm 2 for H 2 production during water oxidation in 1 M KOH, exhibiting excellent stability for up to 24 h. During urea oxidation, the potential required by Ni 2 CoO 4 microflowers was 1.31 V@10 mA/cm 2 . Ni 2 CoO 4 nanoparticles ' performance is significantly poor during water and urea oxidation compared to the microflower counterpart. Therefore, this work provides detailed insights into designing MMOs with high porosity, increased exposed active sites, and unique structural features that enhance electrocatalytic activity.																			0925-8388	1873-4669				JUN 30	2024	990								174241	10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.174241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.174241		APR 2024											WOS:001227014500001

Herein, NiSe2/MoSe2 heterostructured catalyst with optimized interfacial electron redistribution and urea adsorption energies via a strong built-in electric field was demonstrated effective for the urea-assisted water splitting reactions. Efficient cata-lytic performance was found on NiSe2/MoSe2 hybrid microsphere owing to the combined merits such as the unique structure features, the strong synergetic coupling effects, the increased active sites, and the high amount of intrinsic Ni3+ species. Excellent urea oxidation activity was found to drive 10 mA cm-2 at the potential of 1.33 V when loaded on the glassy carbon electrode, and a cell voltage of 1.47 V was required in the NiSe2/MoSe2||Pt/C urea-water electrolyzer to drive 10 mA cm-2, about 220 mV less than that of water electrolysis, indicating a less energy consumption technique during the electrolysis. The spectroscopic and theoretical analysis revealed the effective synergy of the Ni-Se bond and Mo-Se bond that would be promising for efficient catalyst system construction.

In this work, Fe and F ion co-doped Ni3S2 nanoarrays grown on Ni foam substrate were prepared by typical hydrothermal and sulfuration processes for the first time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrate that the adsorption energy of the ma-terial to water is greatly enhanced due to the doping of F and Fe, which is conducive to the formation of intermediate species and the improvement of electrochemical perfor-mance of the electrode. The adsorption energy of anions (F and S) and cations (Fe and Ni) to water in each material was also calculated, and the results showed that F ion showed the most optimal adsorption energy of water, which proved that the doping of F and Fe was beneficial to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode. It is worth noting that the surface of Fe-F-Ni3S2 material will undergo reconstruction during the process of water oxidation reaction and urea oxidation reaction, and amorphous oxides or hydroxides in situ would be formed on the surface of electrode, which are the real active species.

Nevertheless, the activity limitation of Co-based catalysts by the unavoidable self-oxidation reaction of Co species (CSOR) during UOR is generally ignored. Therefore, the interface strategy was used to synthesize a CoSe2 hollow cube (HC)/CoSe2 nanosheet (NS) homogeneous interface catalyst to achieve bifunctional UOR and HER performance. In situ EIS, ex situ Raman spectroscopy, and ex situ XPS analysis verify the unique mechanism of the CoSe2 HC/CoSe2 NS interface in triggering UOR. Electrochemical activity tests demonstrated that CoSe2 HC/CoSe2 NS requires only 1.27 and 1.32 V of cell voltage to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in the overall urea electrolyzer (UOR || HER) and overall human urine electrolyzer (HUOR || HER) regimes, respectively. Moreover, under an industrial-grade current (500 mA cm(-2)), the cell voltage can be maintained at < 2 V for 110 h. Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy confirms the potential of CoSe2 HC/CoSe2 NS to degrade urea wastewater. Software simulations reveal the advantages of the unique interface strategy of CoSe2 HC/CoSe2 NS in the UOR process.

The substantially low potential for the urea electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) can tackle this problem by replacing the OER at the electrolyzer anode. Herein, the NiCo2O4 spinel with rich oxygen vacancies (O-v) and embedded within mesoporous carbon network (O-v-NiCo2O4@mC) was derived from NiCo-based Prussian blue analogous (NiCo PBA) and exploited as the bifunctional electrocatalyst of the UOR and OER for boost the hydrogen production via the overall water splitting. Benefiting to the regular skeleton and abundant dual metal sites of NiCo PBA, the derived O-v-NiCo2O4@mC comprises abundant oxygen vacancies, lattice defects, and adjustable electron structure. These features afford O-v-NiCo2O4@mC the improved UOR ability, showing the potential of 1.33 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with a small Tafel slopes of 31 mV dec(-1), remarkably lower than that of the OER (1.51 V versus RHE, Tafel slope = 85 mV dec(-1)). The UOR performance of O-v-NiCo2O4@mC substantially outperforms to most of the reported Co and/or Ni-based electrocatalysts. Impressively, the assembled two-electrode urea-assisted overall water splitting device shows the small voltage for the hydrogen production (1.43 V versus RHE) and good long-term stability. The present work can provide a new alternative for the efficient hydrogen production using the MOFs-derivatives.																			1572-6657	1873-2569				NOV 15	2024	973								118687	10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118687		OCT 2024											WOS:001329727200001

Using paper templates with abundant pores to prepare thin porous metal materials helps to obtain high-performance electrode materials. The nano amorphous B-doped Ni/crystalline Ni (nanoam Ni-B/Ni) foil composite electrodes were derived from paper templates prepared by impregnation, high-temperature reduction, and electrodeposition methods. Porous Ni foils (Nip) derived thinnest rice ("Xuan") paper, initially used for Chinese calligraphy and painting, exhibits the best performance due to its strong adsorption and wettability. Compared to direct current electrodeposition, pulse electrodeposition yields finer amorphous B-doped Ni nanoparticles with good catalytic performance. Under a current density of 100 mA<middle dot>cm-2, the nanoam Ni-B/Ni composite electrode prepared under a duty cycle of 0.5-1.0 s achieved current densities of 290.4 mA<middle dot>cm-2 (MOR) and 340.4 mA<middle dot>cm-2 (UOR) at 0.8 V, which are improved by 37.1% and 55.1%, respectively, compared to those of Nip. After 2000 cycles, with solution replacement, the current densities maintained 99.2% (MOR) and 81.6% (UOR) of the original values, showing excellent electrocatalytic stability. This research provided a new use for Chinese rice paper, and the prepared Nip-based electrode, with a thickness of about 60 mu m and a low area quality, had a simple preparation process and good electrochemical properties, and can be used as a potential substitute for commercial Ni foam for portable or small electrochemical devices.

The efficient and selective electrocatalysts for UOR are crucial to achieve this. Herein, two NiS-based NiS/Ni3S2 and NiS/NiS2 heterojunctions with Ni cores embedding in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NiS/Ni3S2- and NiS/NiS2-Ni@NCNT) are demonstrated as efficient UOR electrocatalysts. The electrocatalytic UOR performance over heterojunctions is efficiently tuned by altering the electron transfer direction on their interfaces. NiS/Ni3S2-Ni@NCNT with interface electrons transferring from Ni3S2 to NiS, delivers a 10 mA cm-2 UOR current density in 1.0 m KOH with 0.5 m urea at 1.37 V, superior to NiS/NiS2-Ni@NCNT with the electron transfer direction from NiS to NiS2. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that NiS/Ni3S2 Mott-Schottky heterojunctions facilitate the rapid in situ formation of NiOOH active species by removing electrons of Ni3S2, and also accelerate the adsorption and conversion of urea molecules and key intermediates of *CON2 at its interfaces. This work demonstrates an interface electron transfer direction tuning strategy on heterojunctions for harvesting high-performance UOR electrocatalysts.

In this work, a series of M doped N-Ni3S2 (M = Cu, Fe, Co and Ce) material was firstly synthesized and in situ grown on nickel foam substrate by a typical two-step hydrothermal synthesis method.

What is note-worthy is that the Fe doped N-Ni3S2 material exhibits superior water oxidation properties with requiring only 270 mV of overpotentials to drive current densities of 100 mA cm-2, which is one of the best activities reported so far. After a long time of durability measurement, the current density of the Fe doped N-Ni3S2 material will be attenuated, suggesting that the surface of the material will be in situ oxidized to oxide or hydroxide, which is the true active species. For urea oxidation, the Co doped N-Ni3S2 material shows su-perior catalytic performance with requiring only 1.36 V potentials to drive 100 mA cm-2 current densities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that different adsorption energy of water for N-Ni3S2, N-Cu-Ni3S2, N-Fe-Ni3S2 and N-Co-Ni3S2 leads to the different catalytic activity. Experimental results de-monstrate that the improved catalytic performance is assigned to faster electron transfer rates, exposure of abundant active center and better conductivity due to N and cation doping. This work provides new lessons for doping engineering for water splitting reactions. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, the slow kinetics of the anodic half-reaction (OER) significantly reduces the efficiency of this system. Therefore, choosing an alternative to OER has become a new and reliable approach. Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is considered an excellent alternative to OER due to its low required potential (0.37V), the abundance of urea sources (industrial waste and human/ animal urine), and harmless by-products (N2, CO2). Electrocatalysts based on non-noble metals such as nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, manganese, iron, and copper in electrochemical urea-assisted water splitting due to their high electrocatalytic performance and lower price than noble metals play an essential role in reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of this system. This review investigated the electrochemical water splitting reaction and its anodic and cathodic half-reactions. Then, urea, electro-oxidation of urea, methods of making catalysts, measuring parameters of electrocatalytic properties, solutions to improve performance, and types of non-noble catalysts used in this field were reviewed, and finally, challenges and solutions to improve results in the future were introduced.

Herein, the Co(OH)(2) nanosheets arrays doped by different amount of Cu2+ ions were prepared via a one-step solution-phase method for urea-assisted electrolytic hydrogen generation. The Cu integration can regulate electronic structure, activate Co active sites at low potential, and optimize the charge transfer properties and adsorption states of the catalyst. Moreover, the partially distorted cobalt surroundings caused by Cu dopant in the catalyst is conductive to favor the adsorption of urea and water molecules to the active sites. The optimal Cu-6.2%-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets array exhibited superior urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances. Assembling an overall urea electrolyzer using two Cu-6.2%-Co(OH)(2) electrodes gave rise to very small voltages of 1.389 V for 10 mA cm(-2) and 1.781 V for a high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) with remarkable operational stability. The Cu2+ ions doping strategy can be extended to a series of Ni-based compounds with adjustable electronic structures for boosting the activities of UOR and HER.

Advancements in Ni-based Catalysts for Direct Urea Fuel Cells: A Comprehensive Review	CHEMELECTROCHEM												The growing demand for sustainable energy sources has spurred significant studies to optimize the potency of fuel cell technology. Direct urea fuel cell (DUFC) has gained attention due to their energy density, eco-friendliness, and potential applications in power generation using urea from various sources, including wastewater and urine. Efficient electrocatalysts are pivotal in DUFCs, and nickel-based catalysts, particularly in the form of NiOOH, have demonstrated cost effectiveness, excellent stability in alkaline media, and good activity for urea oxidation reaction. However, low-density and durability are still the major limitation in the overall DUFC performance. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest development in Ni-based catalysts, covering synthesis methods, factors influencing the catalytic activity as well as their implications for DUFC performance durability and commercial viability. In addition, another important factor including the use of different oxidant and electrolyte medium is also elaborated. Based on this review, 2D-3D Ni-based materials with the addition of other metals and the use of non-oxide nickel binary compound are predicted to be the future evolution of the effective nickel-based catalysts.

This simple, practical, and phosgene-free route includes the generation of an isocyanate intermediate in situ via anodic decarboxylation of an oxamic acid in the presence of an organic base, followed by the one-pot addition of suitable nucleophiles to afford the corresponding ureas, carbamates, and thiocarbamates. This procedure is applicable to different amines, alcohols, and thiols. Furthermore, when single-pass continuous electrochemical flow conditions were used and this reaction was run in a carbon graphite C-gr/C-gr flow cell, urea compounds could be obtained in high yields within a residence time of 6 min, unlocking access to substrates that were inaccessible under batch conditions while being easily scalable.

The present work, proposes a promising and energy efficient strat-egy by coupling seawater splitting with urea decomposition lowering oxidation potential and thereby avoiding hypochlorite formation even at high current density. The rational design of Mott-Schottky heterojunction of Se/NiSe2 as electrocatalyst is considered to be highly effective in this regard. The devel-oped Se/NiSe2 exhibits extraordinary energy saving for alkaline seawater splitting in presence of urea. The Se/NiSe2/NF || Se/NiSe2/NF electrolyser configuration achieved 10 and 50 mAcm-2 current densities with cell voltage of 1.59 and 1.70 V along with outstanding operational durability over 50 h. The large number of carrier density generates by synergistic self-driven electron transfer from Se to NiSe2 at the heterojunction, unique metallic properties of selenium (Se), and also abundance accessible reactive edges on the porous channel of Ni foam are believed to be the reason behind such enhanced electrocatalytic activities towards urea oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction offering unique and much energy saving approach for alkaline-urea-seawater electrolysis avoiding hypochlorite formation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate E-field-enhanced direct photocatalytic urea oxidation and a visible-light-driven direct urea fuel cell (LDUFC) with tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)(3)](2+))-enabled plasmonic nanopigments that contain a phospholipid membrane self-assembled around a Ag nanoparticle (NP) whose LSPR overlaps the [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). In the hierarchical plasmonic nanopigment design, the membrane serves as scaffold and spacer to localize [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) in an electromagnetic "sweet spot" where substantial plasmonic enhancement of photoexcitation is achieved while strong metal-associated quenching of the reactive excited state is avoided. The demonstration of plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic urea oxidation and the implementation of the LDUFC represent important advancements toward improved light-driven waste-water treatment and efficient solar energy conversion.

In this work, the sphereflower like NiSe2-NiMoO4 heterostructure catalyst self-supported on nickel foam (NiSe2-NiMoO4/NF) is successfully prepared through hydrothermal and selenization method. Only 1.32 V and -35.57 mV are required to obtain +/- 10 mA cm-2 for urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction (UOR and HER), respectively. For a two-electrode electrolyzer, only a cell voltage of 1.37 V is required to drive 10 mA cm-2, and it shows robust durability with working continuously for 100 h at 150 mA cm-2 without obvious activity attenuation. The optimized H* and urea molecule adsorption energy on NiSe2-NiMoO4 heterostructure, novel morphology with mesoporous and self-supporting structure could be the reasons for this good performance. This work thus proposes a strategy for designing highly efficient bifunctional catalysts toward UOR and HER.

The key challenge is to develop an effective electrocatalyst with low-cost, high-performance and high-corrosion resistance in harsh environment. Here, a self-supported carbon coated nickel cobalt phosphide grown on nickel foam (CoNiP@C/NF) electrode is synthe-sized by combining hydrothermal synthesis and plasma processing. Surface coating by graphene-like nano-structure and phosphorization are achieved at mild temperature by low temperature CH4 plasma and Ar-H-2-P plasma, respectively, enabling retention of the sea urchin-like structure obtained by hydrothermal reaction. Benefiting from the modulated built-in electric field, the self-supporting CoNiP@C/NF electrode exhibits highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), featured for the low voltage of 1.43 V at 20 mA cm(-2) of a HER||UOR electrolysis cell. Whether in alkaline solution or organic wastewater, CoNiP@C/NF electrodes could generate H-2 continuously and stably for more than 60 h. DFT calculation indicates that Ni doping modifies the surface charge density, which optimizes the adsorption/desorption of intermediates and facilitates the water dissociation during HER. Moreover, CoNiP possesses strong binding with the C layer, thus promoting the structural stability and charge transfer efficiency of the catalyst.					li, xingyun/AAA-7722-2022														1385-8947	1873-3212				DEC 15	2022	450		3						138225	10.1016/j.cej.2022.138225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2022.138225		JUL 2022											WOS:000837020700002

In contrast, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), with its lower thermodynamic barrier, presents a promising alternative to OER. In this study, we designed and synthesized hierarchical CoFe-PBA@S/NiFe-LDH nanoboxes. Sulfur doping in nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (S/NiFe-LDH) introduces a weak built-in electric field (BIEF), which is further strengthened when combined with cobalt-iron Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) to form a heterojunction. This heterojunction created localized charge polarization at the interface, facilitating efficient electron transfer and reducing the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates, thereby significantly improving intrinsic catalytic activity. Under conditions of 1 M KOH and 0.33 M urea, the CoFe-PBA@S/NiFe-LDH catalyst achieved a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low potential of 1.321 V, accompanied by a low Tafel slope (53 mV dec(-1)). Additionally, it maintained stability at 30 mA cm(-2) for 40 h. This work provides vital insights for the strategic design of highly effective heterojunction catalysts for the UOR.

Herein, through simply tailoring the selenization temperature, for the first time we achieve the controllable transition engineering from the homogeneous NiSe2 nanowrinkles (NiSe2 NWs) to heterogeneous Ni3Se4/NiSe2 nanorods (Ni3Se4/NiSe2 NRs) on Ni foam substrate. The unique rod-like nanoarray architecture with high surface roughness can greatly improve the mass transport efficiency. More importantly, the density function theory calculations decipher that the electron redistribution spontaneously takes place at the interfacial region between Ni3Se4 and NiSe2, which could optimize the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates and decrease the Gibbs free energy of rate determining step for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). As a consequence, the heteroge-neous Ni3Se4/NiSe2 NRs manifests superior UOR performance than its counterpart of homogeneous NiSe2 NWs, especially at large current densities.

However, the sluggish kinetics caused by the six-electron processes increase the barrier energy for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this work, hierarchical NiMo-WOx and NiCo-WOx nanowires are newly synthesized as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR electrocatalysts, respectively, via a facile two-step process involving thermal evaporation and electrodeposition. Due to the higher surface exposure of active sites and greater electrical conductivity of the hierarchical structure, NiMo-WOx exhibits high HER activity with an overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec- 1, which is similar to the activity of a Pt. Hierarchical NiCo-WOx exhibits high UOR activity, requiring only 1.38 V to drive 100 mA cm-2, which is 0.28 V lower than the oxygen evolution reaction (1.69 V). Assembling NiMo-WOx and NiCo-WOx as the HER and UOR electrodes, respectively, for UE requires a potential of only 1.39 V for 10 mA cm-2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.7 %. An unassisted hydrogen production system is also demonstrated by combining UE and perovskite photovoltaic cells, producing a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 11 %.

The main challenge lies in fabricating high-efficient catalysts with optimized electronic structure and understanding the intrinsic structure-related mechanisms. Here, we report a feasible strategy of regulating the rate-determining step (RDS) of UOR via an electrochemical reconstructed Co hydroxide catalyst incorporated with V single atoms. The optimal catalysts exhibit an enhanced UOR performance after V incorporation while remarkably suppressed the competitive oxygen evolution with the potential of 1.54 V (vs RHE) to achieve the current density of 30 mA cm(-2). Operando synchrotron-radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR-FTIR) combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that enabled by single atom V incorporation, the RDS of UOR has been changed from the first deprotonation step to the second one with a lower energy barrier of 2.05 eV (vs 2.6 eV), which is thermodynamically favorable for the overall reaction process.

Moreover, the utilization of P/Cr60-NiMoO4 as a dualfunctional catalyst only needs 1.35 V to reach 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte with 0.33 M urea, representing a reduction of 180 mV compared to conventional water electrocatalysis devices (OER//HER systems). Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory reveal that the superior activity of the P/Crincorporation system can be attributed to its ability to enhance interface electron concentration, promote electron transfer, and reduce the free energy barriers associated with both UOR and HER.

Meantime, UOR also provides a good way to treat wastewater rich in urea. Since anode UOR involves the 6 e- transfer process, inexpensive and highperformance electrocatalysts are required to improve electrochemical efficiency. Polyoxometalate are mostly used as precursor materials for HER researches, but are rarely used for UOR performance. Most of the bound UOR and HER electrocatalysts are Ni-based catalysts and MoXC, respectively. Here, polyoxometalate (PMo12) coupled with transition metal Ni as the precursor was synthesized the bimetallic Ni/MoC@NC electrocatalyst by hightemperature calcination. Ni/MoC@NC exhibits powerful bifunctional catalytic performance. For HER, a current density of 10 mA cm -2 can be driven in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH at overpotentials of 111 mV and 143 mV, respectively. As for UOR, 1.384 V is needed to realize a current density of 10 mA cm -2. Furthermore, for urea electrolysis (HER||UOR), 1.372 V can drive the current density of 10 mA cm -2, much less than water electrolysis. The synergistic effect of Ni and MoC nanoparticles and the doping of N endow the bimetallic catalyst excellent HER and UOR performance. Therefore, POMs can be used not only as an excellent precursor for HER catalysts, but also for UOR catalysts, which provides a possibility for the material selection of UOR catalysts and a good catalyst design scheme for high -efficiency and energy -saving hydrogen production.

Electrooxidation of urea and creatinine on nickel foam-based electrocatalysts	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY												Electrooxidation of urea and creatinine is desirable for wastewater remediation and portable dialysis to remove the two solutes from aqueous waste streams. Urine concentrations of urea (330 mM) and creatinine (18 mM) are relevant for wastewater remediation, while portable dialysis must be able to remove blood serum concentrations of urea (10 mM) and creatinine (0.18 mM) from dialysate. Three nickel foam-based electrocatalysts (clean Ni foam, Ni hydroxide, and Ni hydroxide doped with 1 mol% iron) were examined as substrates for the simultaneous electrooxidation of urea and creatinine. Electrodes were hydrothermally fabricated and characterized by loading, scanning electron microscopy, and elemental mapping. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry were used to electrochemically evaluate the three catalysts. All electrochemical experiments were performed at room temperature and pH 14. The results indicate that creatinine in urea solutions suppresses the oxidation current relative to urea-only solutions on Ni foam and Ni hydroxide catalysts. On iron-doped Ni hydroxide, an enhanced oxidation current occurs in cyclic voltammetry of creatinine/urea solutions, with the effect greater for dialysaterelevant concentrations. In chronoamperometry measurements, a slight decrease in oxidation current is observed for urea/creatinine solutions as compared with urea alone. This behavior is attributed to concurrent reactions of urea and creatinine subject to site blocking by adsorbed creatinine fragments that becomes evident at long timescales. [GRAPHICS] .

However, it remains great challenge to develop a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) simultaneously due to the torpid kinetics of 6 e(-) transfer during UOR. Here, graphene oxide (GO) induced phase-controlled synthesis of nickel tellurides derived from Ni foam (NF) as freestanding electrocatalysts is reported. Results show that NF-assisted NiTe composited with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) exhibits superior activity for both HER and UOR. With the combined merits of HER and UOR, an efficient electrolyzer with integrated NiTe/rGO/NF was constructed as anode and cathode, representing overall urea decomposition at a low overpotential and even being driven by a commercial cell of 1.5 V. The metallic character and phase dependence of NiTe2 and NiTe toward UOR were simulated by density functional theory (DFT). The collective effects of rGO incorporation in morphology and phase for exposing more active sites and effective electron transport were discussed. It is extended to the direction of human urine conversion as well. Our study provides new insights into robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea splitting, which indicates promise for sustainable hydrogen evaluation and wastewater remediation.					guo, chen/KTR-9590-2024; guo, peng/AAG-4052-2019; Wang, Zhaojie/Z-1292-2018; Lu, Xiaoqing/C-3246-2012	Wang, Zhaojie/0000-0002-6476-6449; Lu, Xiaoqing/0000-0002-7553-7131													2574-0962					MAY	2019	2	5					3363	3372		10.1021/acsaem.9b00208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.9b00208													WOS:000469885300044

In this work, interlaced rosette-like MoS2/Ni3S2/NiFe-layered double hydroxide/nickel foam (LDH/NF) is successfully synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal reaction. Due to its unique interlaced heterostructure, MoS2/Ni3S2/NiFe-LDH/NF exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activity towards the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. In a concurrent two-electrode electrolyser (MoS2/Ni3S2/NiFe-LDH/NF(+,-)), only voltage of 1.343 V is required to reach 50 mA cm(-2), which is 216 mV lower than for pure water splitting. Furthermore, after 16 h of urea electrolysis in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, the current density remains at 98% of the original value. Thus, the catalyst is not only favorable for H-2 production, but also has great significance for the problem of urea-rich wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The physicochemical properties and electrocatalytic performances have been investigated. Due to the structural effect and electronic effect, the Ni-P nanocatalysts achieve a lower overpotential, higher activity and better stability compared with the Ni nanocatalysts.

Herein, we fabricated an Ni2P-MoP2 heterostructure with a hierarchical structure grown on carbon paper (Ni-Mo-P/CP), which exhibited robust activity and outstanding durability for the electrocatalytic oxidation of urea. The Ni-Mo-P/CP catalyst possessed an ultralow potential of 1.39 V to obtain the current density of 100 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope (27 mV dec(-1)) and long-term durability with almost no decay within 15 h. The experimental characterization revealed that the optimized electronic structure and the synergistic effect of abundant exposed active sites in the Ni-Mo-P/CP catalyst contribute to the efficient UOR catalytic activity.

In the present work, we developed Cerium dioxide (CeO2) and nickel selenide (Ni0.85Se) nanoparticles integrated into three-dimensional N-doped carbon nanosheets to be used as efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for MOR and UOR. By optimizing the selenization temperature, the CeO2-modified Ni0.85Se obtained at selenization temperature of 550 degrees C (CeO2-Ni0.85Se-550-NC) has the best MOR and UOR electrochemical performance. The CeO2-Ni0.85Se-550-NC potential only requires 1.309 V (MOR) and 1.294 V (UOR) to reach 10 mA cm-2, respectively. The DFT study reveals that CeO2-Ni0.85Se-550-NC has the best reaction path with the synergistic effect between CeO2 and Ni0.85Se. The outstanding catalytic performance of CeO2-Ni0.85Se-550-NC may be due to the cointeraction between CeO2 and Ni0.85Se, allowing more defects that function as catalytic sites while pro-moting fast electron transfer in the N-doped carbon substrate.

Herein, hierarchical microspheres constructed by hexagonal NiCo(OH)2 nanosheets with rich Ni3+ species and surface carboxylic groups are synthesized by using the NiCo-based MOFs as the sacrificial templates. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in-situ Raman characterizations confirm the presence of the surface carboxylic groups. The introduction of the surface carboxylic groups is revealed for the first time to greatly enhance the UOR catalytic activity. Owing to the unique structure (two-dimensional nanosheets in three-dimensional microspheres) and the numerous Ni3+ species and surface carboxylic groups, the as-prepared hexagonal NiCo(OH)2 nanosheets exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance, requiring only 1.368 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode to reach a current density of 100 mA cm-2.

Voltammetry study of electrocatalytic activity of lanthanum nickel perovskite nanoclusters-based composite catalyst for effective oxidation of urea in alkaline medium	SYNTHETIC METALS												Effective electrooxidation of urea has been the focus of research and development for energy and environmental applications. A modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode with two successive layers of conducting poly(aniline) (PANI) and lanthanum nickel oxide (LNO)-graphene oxide (GO) mixture was fabricated for urea electrooxidation in alkaline medium. Different conditions of catalyst preparation were examined for optimum electrocatalytic activity towards urea oxidation. GO improved the response and is considered advantageous support for the perovskite due to its structural and electronic differences compared to graphene (G). The highest electrocatalytic activity observed was for non-calcinated perovskite catalyst prepared by citric acid fuel and physically mixed with GO in the ratio (1:2). The use of La2NiO4 perovskite is beneficial with relatively low weight percentage of Ni (14.6 %) compared to other Ni-based catalysts for electrooxidation of urea. The perovskite catalyst is synthesized using microwave-assisted method that reduces chemicals usage and energy consumption. The non-calcinated perovskite catalyst and the (PANI/LNO-GO) composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis (SEM-EDAX). The composite is applicable in temperature range (10 degrees C up to 50 degrees C), and at different urea concentrations from 0.1 M to 1.0 M in basic (KOH) electrolyte.

Only 1.39 V was needed to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) for 40 h without noticeably declining activity.

However, in situ synthesis is often difficult due to multistep procedures and harsh conditions. Herein, NiFe2O4 nanoparticles are successfully grown in situ on NiFe(OH)(x) nanosheets via using unique laser ablation in liquids technology. The quenching effect of the pulsed laser and the reduction of BH4- promote the generation of oxygen-vacancy-abundant NiFe(OH)(x)/NiFe2O4 nanocomposites, and the weak alkalinity of the NaBH4 solutions accelerates the production of NiFe(OH)(x) nanosheets.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis of the as-synthesized materials shows semi-spherical particles with good dispersion on the carbon Vulcan having sizes of 3.2, 2.5 and 2.2 nm for Ni, PtNi, and PtPdNi, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms the presence of Pt, Pd, and Ni FCC crystal structure and reveals the formation PtNi and PtPdNi solid solutions. Additionally, XPS Pt4f core-level spectra shown a shift to lower binding energy at the alloy formation due to the addition of nickel and palladium evidencing a solid solution. The tri-metallic PtPdNi/C catalyst exhibits better performance than PtNi/C and Ni/ C catalysts toward urea oxidation reaction in alkaline conditions suggesting an activity enhancement due to the oxidized Ni species from NiOOH. Using differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS), it has been demonstrated that species such as NH3 (m/z 1/4 17), CO2-or N2O-(m/z 1/4 44) and NO (m/z 1/4 30) are generated during polarization at 4 mV s1.

The as-prepared photocatalyst was characterized by XRD, VSM, BET, FTIR, FE-SEM, UV-Vis-DRS, and PL techniques which proved successful deposition of Fe3O4@WO3 core/shell particle on UiO-66(Zr/Ti)-NFs. The obtained photocatalyst was subsequently applied for urea photo-oxidation. This magnetically recoverable photocatalyst exhibited superior activity due to its desirable band alignment, high stability, and generation of the photo-induced charge carriers, as well as providing a high surface area with low mass transfer resistance. Fe3O4 core acted as charge-carrier to transport the photogenerated charges of UiO-66(Zr/Ti)-NIFs (electron-donor) to WO3 charge-collectors for effective photoconversion. The central composite design was applied to design the experiments matrix in which flow rate, pH, irradiation time, catalyst mass, and initial urea concentration were considered as operational factors. The optimized condition was found by defining the desirability function. 90% degradation percentage was achieved at 550 mL/min solution flowrate, pH = 7, 120 min irradiation time, 0.22 g UiO-66(Zr)-NFs-Fe3O4@WO3, and 40 mg/L of the initial concentration of urea with the desirability value of 0.89. Such a superior photocatalytic activity of UiO-66-Fe304@WO3 can be ascribed to the reclamation of Fe3O4 as a low bandgap carrier, which accelerated the conveyance of electrons and followed surpassing charge separation. Our present findings open a new strategy to produce a wide range of core-shell heterogeneous catalysts to be applied in photoreactors scale-up. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Singla, J; Sangal, VK; Verma, A				Singla, Jayishnu; Sangal, Vikas K.; Verma, Anoop			Evaluation and optimization of the process parameters for the photo-electrochemical treatment of urea using mixed metal oxide anodes	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												The present study investigates the electro-oxidation (EO) treatment of urea containing wastewater using mixed metal oxide (MMO) anodes. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was employed to analyze the effects of various operational process parameters like current density (j), NaCl dose (n), treatment time (t) and pH in an EO reactor in batch mode. The performance of the treatment process was evaluated in terms of % degradation and energy consumption. Under optimum conditions, the experimental results showed that more than 94.78% of degradation of urea was achieved. Electro-oxidation has effectively reduced the TOC (90%) under optimum conditions. Attempts were made to integrate the two process electro-oxidation and photocatalysis i.e. Photoelectrocatalysis within the same treatment unit for the enhanced degradation of target pollutant. The electro-oxidation process with mixed metal oxide anode has also attained a significant removal of nitrogen by transforming into the NO3- and NH4+ through the formation of OH center dot and reactive chlorine species. Characterization techniques like SEM-EDX and XRD have confirmed the durability of mixed metal oxide anodes even after 90 recycles of the experimental run. The total operating cost for electro-oxidation treatment of urea under optimized conditions is found to be 0.78 $/m(3). (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Influence of bimetallic nanoparticles composition and synthesis temperature on the electrocatalytic activity of NiMn-incorporated carbon nanofibers toward urea oxidation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												High efficiency, cost effectivity and the availability of hydrogen are the advantages of electrolysis as a strategy for urea-containing wastewater treatment. Composition, morphology, and synthesis-temperature distinctly affect the performance of the functional electro-catalysts. NiMn-incorporated carbon nanofibers are introduced as effective electrocatalysts for urea oxidation process. Studying the influence of the metallic nanoparticles composition indicated that the nanofibers obtained from an electro-spun solution containing 10 wt% manganese acetate reveal the best performance in terms of both of onset potential and current density. Typically, the nanofibers obtained from electros-pun solutions having 0, 5, 10 and 15 wt% manganese acetate showed 540, 495, 430 and 510 mV (vs. RHE) and 56, 32, 79 and 29 mA/cm(2) onset potentials and current densities, respectively at calcination temperature of 850 degrees C and 2 M urea solution. On the other hand, due to the impact on the crystallinity and final morphology, change in calcination temperature reflects the observable influence on the catalyst performance. At 2 M urea solution, the detected onset potentials and current densities were 590, 470, 430 and 440 mV, and 5, 22, 79 and 69 mA/cm(2) for the nanofibers calcined at 550, 700, 850 and 1000 degrees C, respectively. Accordingly, these results indicated that the synthesis temperature must be maintained at 850 degrees C. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of optimizing the bimetallic electrocatalysts composition and synthesis temperature. Moreover, it was detected that the carbon nanofibers prepared from poly(vinyl alcohol) reveal high electric conductivity compared to the commercial nanofibers obtained from the expensive polyacrylonitrile polymer.

However, determining the specific contributions of changes in surface properties versus increases in electrochemically active sites remains challenging. In this study, we present a CO2 laser-assisted approach to rapidly construct a nitrogen-doped graphene (NDG) aerophobic layer on nickel foam, resulting in an NDG-covered electrode (NDGNF-0.52 %). The presence of the aerophobic layer significantly reduces gas bubble adhesion force, reducing it to negligible levels compared to NF, which exhibits a force of about 42 mu N. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the electrochemically active surface area of NDG-NF-0.52 % is nearly identical to that of NF. NDG-NF-0.52 % exhibits excellent properties for the UOR, requiring only a potential of 1.38 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 in a 1 M KOH solution with 0.33 M urea, significantly lower than that required for NF (1.49 V). The impressive electrochemical performance of the electrode can be attributed to the increased aerophobicity, which enhances the mass-transfer capability at the gas-liquid-solid interface, reducing the duration of active site coverage by gas bubbles. This work underscores the crucial role of surface properties in the electrode reaction process and holds significance for the design of high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and UOR electrodes.

Herein, by a facile composite electrodeposition method, an electrocatalyst with Mo particles anchored on the Ni-P matrix (Mo/Ni-P) was fabricated and utilized for urea-assisted water electrolysis of hydrogen production. As expected, the urea-involved electrolytic cell with the as-obtained Mo/Ni-P served as both the anode and cathode merely needs a voltage of 1.55 V to sustain a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) (0.16 V less than that of the conventional water splitting at 50 mA cm(-2)) and can maintain the stability for 12 h. Additionally, the solar-driven urea-assisted water electrolysis system was constructed under lab conditions and solar-hydrogen-electricity energy conversion processes were also simulated. Moreover, it was demonstrated that tungsten (W) particles can also serve as an accelerant for promotion both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR activity of pristine Ni-P. This work will present a facile method for rational integration of metal particles with Ni-P layer for highly efficient electrocatalysts applied in economic production of H-2. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of the fitting method, urea concentration and polarized potential on the impedance behavior are deeply studied to understand more about the anodic process of urea. The best-fitting equivalent circuit (R-h, R-1/CPE1, R-2/CPE2) should have two charge transfer processes in addition to electrolyte resistance, i.e., the formation of NiOOH and urea degradation. The Nyquist (Z(/), -Z(//)) plots showed two semicircles in the presence of urea/KOH, which can be related to the conversion of Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH and urea oxidation at high and low-frequency regions, respectively. At higher urea contents, the electrode surface was covered by more urea beside OH-, and hence the Ni-activation process was decreased which interpreted the decreasing of oxidation at higher urea concentrations. Among the investigated polarized potentials, the best impedance behavior was observed at 0.40 V. The higher impedance behavior in the case of higher potentials can be interpreted via the adsorption of intermediates at the surface of the electroactive catalyst. The mechanism of electrooxidation was suggested deeply to understand the anodic behavior of urea-fuel cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Heteroatom incorporation strategy has been proven to boost electrocatalytic activity by altering electronic structures and revealing more active sites on catalysts. Herein, nickel hydroxide nanosheets with various vanadium incorporation (Vx-Ni(OH)2) were developed through a facile hydrothermal approach. By optimizing the incorporated vanadium contents, V6-Ni(OH)2 catalyst exhibited easily accessible active sites and enhanced charge transfer with structural advantages, then assembled as the working electrode for urea-assisted H2 production. Consequently, V6-Ni(OH)2 catalyst demonstrated superior UOR activity compared with other incorporated samples with an overpotential of 1.33 V and a Tafel slope of 28.3 mV dec-1. Theoretical calculations revealed that the improved UOR activity was attributed to the potential determining step of V-Ni(OH)2, which exhibited lower energy in comparison with the pristine Ni(OH)2 and increased electronic states density near the Fermi level. Both experimental and theoretical calculations confirmed vanadium incorporation on Ni(OH)2 could modify the electronic structure of Ni(III) species, improving electrical conductivity, and optimizing the adsorption energy for key reaction intermediates. Furthermore, the crucial contribution of vanadium incorporation with optimized electronic structures to the high UOR activity of Ni(OH)2 is demonstrated.image Heteroatom incorporation is proven to boost electrocatalytic activity by altering electronic structures and revealing more active sites on catalysts.

In this paper, molybdates (NiMoO4 4 and CoMoO4) 4 ) that grow on nickel foam are treated with vulcanization and nitriding methods, and Mo doped Ni3S2 3 S 2 (Mo-Ni3S2) 3 S 2 ) and N doped CoMoO4 4 (N-CoMoO4) 4 ) are prepared, respectively. Mo-Ni3S2 3 S 2 exhibits excellent UOR activity requiring only 1.335 V to drive 100 mA cm-- 2 . It is found that Mo-Ni3S2 3 S 2 participated in both of the decomposition of urea (15.4 %) to form NH3 3 and the oxidation reaction of urea (84.6 %) to form N2 2 to keep the anodic reaction in the low potential range, avoiding the oxidation of nickel sites in the catalyst to form NiOOH. In addition, N-CoMoO4 4 catalyst exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity requiring only 67 mV to drive 100 mA cm-- 2 . Finally, the catalysts prepared by molybdate are used to construct urea oxidation electrolytic system. The Mo-Ni3S2 3 S 2 (+) || N-CoMoO4 4 (-) urea oxidation-assisted water splitting system requires only 1.47 V to achieve 100 mA cm-2 , which is a voltage reduction of 180 mV compared to conventional water electrolysis systems. The system realizes high energy efficiency hydrogen production and urea wastewater purification. This work provides insights into the design of low-energy-consuming hydrogen production systems.

Herein, a tractable hydrothermal protocol coupled with subsequent nitridation is found to enable uniform growth of the Ni3N/Ni0.2Mo0.8N heterostructure microspheres assembled by the uniform nanorod arrays on the nickel foam framework (Ni3N/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/NF). The as-obtained Ni3N/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/NF catalyst exhibits multifunctional superior performance for both overall water and urea electrolysis. For HER, the low overpotentials of 55 and 65 mV can be only required to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, for UOR a ultrasmall potential of 1.328 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) occurs, which is much lower than that required for OER process. When applying the Ni3N/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/NF as anode for OER and cathode for HER, the water electrolyzer requires low cell voltages of 1.487 and 1.724 V to achieve 10 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. More significantly, the urea electrolyser presents ultralow cell voltages of 1.348 and 1.514 Vat 10 and 200 mA cm(-2) and remarkable longevity for over 500 h. Such impressive performances exceed most reported noble-metal-free catalysts and even vie for the benchmarking noble metal catalysts, heralding its tremendous utilitarian prospects for the cost-effective and energy-saving hydrogen generation.

Here, we had prepared three conductive 2D MOF based on Ni, NiCo and Co in a simple and rapid way. The 2D nanostructure of MOF was confirmed by SEM and TEM. The chemical composition was studied by XRD, Raman and XPS spectrum. The electrochemical oxidation and detection was investigated through cyclic voltammetry and current-time method. Their sensing performance for urea was determined by varying oxidation potentials and metal sites. The non-enzymatic Ni-, NiCo- and Co-MOF sensors had good catalytic activity for urea. Compared with NiCo- and Co-MOF, Ni-MOF had a wider linear range (0.5-832.5 mu M), high sensitivity (1960 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)), low detection limit (0.471 mu M), and fast response time. The sensors had well repeatability, reproducibility, and selectivity to specific interfering species. Furthermore, Ni- and NiCo-MOF modified electrode was also applied to detection of milk samples. The results showed that the recovery was satisfactory, which further confirmed the effectiveness of non-enzyme sensor.

In this text, we demonstrate an interfacial engineering to prepare a heterostructure of porous Ni3S2 nanospheres decorated CoP nanoplates on NF scaffold (NF/CoP@Ni3S2). It exhibits the eminent catalytic competence towards HER (-68.9 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and UOR (1.379 V at 100 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, whether for HER or UOR, its performance degradation is almost negligible after working for 27 h at 50 mA cm(-2). Finally, the constructed (- )NF/CoP@Ni3S2||Ni3S2@CoP/NF(+) device just needs 1.574 V to afford a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with an outstanding durability (only 4.2 % of the voltage rise is observed after electrolyzing for 27 h).

To investigate the effects of urea on sediment phosphorus (P) release, we carried out a 2-month mesocosm experiment with six targeted loadings of urea (0-0.6 mg N L-1 d(-1)). Results showed that: i) urea was rapidly transformed into ammonium and then nitrate (NO3-). ii) When nitrogen occurred as urea or ammonium, minor P release was observed. iii) After urea were mostly converted to NO3-, P release became clearer. iv) NO3- had a dual effect by promoting P release through decreasing sediment pH and increasing alkaline phosphatase activity or by inhibiting P release through improving sediment oxidation. v) The overall effects of urea on P release depended on the ultimate NO3- concentrations, being prominent when NO3- >= 11 mg N L-1.

The hexagonal crystal structure for Ni2P was indicated by the characteristic peaks in the XRD patterns, and lattice fringes of Ni2P were clearly observed in the high-resolution TEM images. The catalytic ability for urea electrooxidation was studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques. It was found that the current density at 0.5 V was ca. 70.4 mA cm(-2), about 2.7 times higher than that of the referenced commercial nickel oxide catalyst. A good catalytic stability for urea oxidation was also obtained. A diffusion-controlled process was observed for urea oxidation on Ni2P catalyst while the active sites arising from Ni(II) ion oxidation was following a surface-redox-reaction-controlled process. Kinetics studies by impedance spectroscopy and Tafel slope analysis displayed improved charge-transfer kinetics towards urea electrooxidation. The results demonstrated that Ni2P would have potential applications for catalytic urea oxidation.

Ni-based LDHs are widely known for their substantial capability in urea oxidation reactions (UOR). This study involved the synthesis of NiCr-LDH/V4C3 MXene nanocomposites (NCVs) and the evaluation of their electrochemical efficiency towards UOR. The hybridization of V4C3 with NiCr-LDH improved the redox kinetics of the nanocomposite. NCV-21 achieved a notable efficiency of 10 mA cm-2 at a lower onset potential of 1.36 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in a 1.0 M KOH solution containing 0.33 M urea. Furthermore, it demonstrated an enhanced current density of 112.64 mA cm-2 and long-term durability. The robust interaction and electronic coupling between NiCr-LDH and V4C3 MXene, marked by superior current density and significant charge transfer, confers the nanocomposite with remarkable catalytic activity and stability towards substantial urea oxidation performance. Based on the results obtained, the NiCr-LDH/V4C3 MXene nanocomposite is an efficient anodic catalyst for urea oxidation. This study will open a new avenue for the development of various LDH/MXene nanocomposites for energy conservation applications.

Nevertheless, the essence of electrode function mechanism of catalysts remains unclear. Therefore, design and optimization of catalysts are restricted. Herein, an in situ Raman spectroscopy method is employed to directly measure the electrode properties of the NiCo double hydroxides (NiCo DHs) under working conditions. Given definitely evidence, the evolution process of in situ Raman spectra shows that the Ni element is converted to NiOOH under UOR potentials, while the Co dopant is converted to CoOOH and further to higher-valence CoO2 species. Obviously, the catalytically active phase toward UOR is really a complex NiOOH-CoOOH-CoO2 phase. Accurately matched spectral wavenumbers and electrochemical measurements of the catalytic electrodes explicitly reveal that the addition of Co assuredly reduces the onset potential for electroactive NiOOH formation. The Raman results also indicate effects of the Ni-O bond elongation and increased disorder caused by Co doping. Herein, an important understanding and new mechanistic perspectives for the electrode reaction process of UOR with NiCo binary catalysts are provided.

We here report the design and synthesis of a bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst of nitrogen-doped carbon sheets supporting Ni@NiO-Cu@CuO composites (Ni@NiO-Cu@CuO/NCS) via direct calcination of Ni- and Cu-containing metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The as-derived nanohybrid shows impressively high catalytic performance towards urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in alkali and nitrate reduction reaction (NRR) in acidic electrolyte, which inspire us to set up a urea-nitrate fuel cell (UNFC). Owing to the excellent electrochemical characteristics behaviour of prepared nanostructures, the fabricated UNFC simultaneously exhibits improved fuel cell performance of 22.55 +/- 2.3 mW cm(-2) and degrade the urine and nitrate at the anode and cathode, respectively. The presented innovative electrochemical device may open up a prime step for the development of renewable UNFC for simultaneous green energy generation and N-containing waste removal.					wen, zhenhai/D-7165-2011; N, Senthilkumar/AAK-7118-2020; Alhakemy, Ahmed/GRJ-3822-2022; Ding, Yichun/G-8182-2016	Alhakemy, Ahmed Zaki/0000-0003-0540-7240; Ding, Yichun/0000-0002-7441-800X; Nangan, Senthilkumar/0009-0000-2105-9878													0926-3373	1873-3883				JUN 5	2021	286								119892	10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.119892	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.119892		JAN 2021											WOS:000621626100004

Herein, asok-like Ni-NiO-Mo0.84Ni0.16/NF hybrids are synthesized via hydrothermal and calcination methods. They exhibit superior catalytic activities for UOR (1.33 V at 50 mA cm(-2)), higher than the ever-reported NiMo-based catalysts, and for HER (0.069 V at 50 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, the decline in catalytic performance is negligible after operating for 60 h at 250 mA cm(-2). We suppose that the reason could be attributed to the special asok-like structure, a self-supported structure formed with 3D nickel foam (NF) and the three-phase hybrids. This work proposes a new strategy for the preparation of asok-like NiMo-based cost-effective catalysts, highly performing for both nitrogen-containing wastewater treatment and large-scale H-2 production.

However, developing efficient electrocatalysts for UOR remains challenging due to the sluggish intrinsic kinetics involved in the six-electron process. In this study, we report the use of carbon-dot-modified ultrathin Ni3S2 nanosheets on nickel foam (Ni3S2-CDs@NF) with a quasi-parallel structure for urea-assisted electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The zero-dimensional/two-dimensional (0D/2D) Ni3S2-CDs@NF catalyst exhibit high bifunctional catalytic activities with a potential of 88 mV for HER and 1.35 V (vs RHE) for UOR at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. By incorporating Ni3S2-CDs@NF into a symmetrical electrolytic cell, low cell voltages of 1.67 and 1.81 V were acquired at the current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm-2 for HER||UOR, which are 110 and 280 mV lower than those of the nonreal HER||OER system, respectively. Further electrochemical tests demonstrated that the 0D/2D heterointerface between CDs and Ni3S2 maximized the exposure of surface-active sites while enhancing the electron transfer rates and reaction kinetics. This study not only offers insights into efficient carbon-dot-based electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis, but also holds significant potential for applications in electrochemical energy conversion and wastewater treatment.

Ni-Cd carbon nanofibers as an effective catalyst for urea fuel cell	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												One of the main challenges facing the development of urea fuel cells is the low catalytic activity of the anode. Ni decorated carbon nano-fiber is a promising anode catalyst in urea fuel cells. In this study, we have investigated the effect of Cd doping of Ni decorated carbon nano-fiber on catalytic activity for urea oxidation. The catalyst was prepared by heat treatment of electrospun nano-fibers containing different percentages of Ni and Cd acetates in poly(vinyl alcohol) under an inert atmosphere at 850 degrees C. The initial percentages of the Cd acetate to Ni acetate in the polymer solution was set at 5, 10, 30, 50 and 70 wt%. The introduction of Cd significantly improved the electro-catalytic activity for urea oxidation. The sample that was prepared with initial 50 wt.% Cd acetate showed the best activity for urea oxidation activity using different urea concentrations, 0.33 M-3 M. The introduction of Cd improved both the quality and the number of active sites for the urea oxidation as seen from the shift of the anodic peak potential and anodic peak current density, respectively.

J	Kumar, S; Bhanuse, GB; Fu, YP				Kumar, Sanath; Bhanuse, Gita B.; Fu, Yen-Pei			Phosphide-Based Electrocatalysts for Urea Electrolysis: Recent Trends and Progress	CHEMPHYSCHEM												Electrolysis is a trend in producing hydrogen as a fuel for renewable energy development, and urea electrolysis is considered as one of the advanced electrolysis processes, where efficient materials still need to be explored. Notably, urea electrolysis came into existence to counter-part the electrode reactions in water electrolysis, which has hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among those reactions, OER is sluggish and limits water splitting. Hence, urea electrolysis emerged with urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and HER as their reactions to tackle the water electrolysis. Among the explored materials, noble-metal catalysts are efficient, but their cost and scarcity limit the scaling-up of the Urea electrolysis. Hence, current challenges must be addressed, and novel efficient electrocatalysts are to be implemented to commercialize urea electrolysis technology. Phosphides, as an efficient UOR electrocatalyst, have gained huge attention due to their exceptional lattice structure geometry. The phosphide group benefits the water molecule adsorption and water dissociation, and facilitates the oxyhydrate of the metal site. This review summarizes recent trends in phosphide-based electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis, discusses synthesis strategies and crystal structure relationship with catalytic activity, and presents the challenges of phosphide electrocatalysts in urea electrolysis. This article gives information about the trends and progress in urea electrolysis application while highlighting the implementation of phosphide-based electrocatalysts. We have also addressed the various synthesis approaches for obtaining phosphide-based electrocatalysts, summarized a few electrochemical performances, current challenges, perspective, and future prospectus towards urea electrolysis, which is beneficial for obtaining hydrogen as a green energy fuel. image					Fu, Yen-Pei/D-1092-2017														1439-4235	1439-7641				APR 16	2024	25	8								10.1002/cphc.202300924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202300924		MAR 2024						38366133					WOS:001178373500001

However, the complex 6-electron transfer process in the UOR causes intrinsic sluggish kinetics, still requiring a significant enhancement in the catalytic activity and energy utilization of electrocatalysts. Hence, this review aims to provide comprehensive insights into how to design high-performance electrocatalysts for the UOR and develop highly efficient UOR-based energy devices. We first highlight the recent progress in the proposed mechanisms (e.g., adsorbate evolution, lattice oxygen involvement, and chemical-electrochemical processes) and general electrochemical evaluation standard parameters for the UOR. Subsequently, five effective strategies of nanocatalyst design are summarized and discussed for improving electrocatalytic urea oxidation. Rationally engineering nanocatalysts' crystal and geometric structure is available for increasing the densities of catalytic active sites. The improvement of intrinsic activity can depend on heteroatom doping and defect engineering to adjust the electronic and coordination environment of active sites. The heterojunction construction strategy can also be adopted to regulate the Janus charge distribution for the adsorption of urea. In addition, relevant practical applications are introduced in detail, such as photoelectrochemical urea splitting for hydrogen production, urea-assisted reversible zinc-air batteries (ZABs), and direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs). The remaining concerns and challenges in the urea electrocatalysis field are also discussed.

The experimental and DFT (density functional theory) investigation reveal metaborate (Ni(Co)(BO2)(2)) exhibits a stronger water adsorption capacity than that conventional metal LDH, which is conducive to the occurrence of hydrogen adsorption in the next step, while NiCo (delta G(H)* is closer to 0) is a more suitable hydrogen reaction site than Ni or Co, this synergistic effect of the two substances greatly promotes Volmer step for HER (hydrogen evolution reaction), thereby fundamentally improving HER. The existence of Co(0 )helps to generate more Ni-0, and Co plays an electronic auxiliary role. The Ni-0(Co-0)-Ni(Co)(BO2)(2)/NF catalyst possesses small charge transfer resistance, large electrochemical surface area and good hydrophilicity. The Ni-0(Co-0)-Ni(Co)(BO2)(2)/NF catalyst exhibits a great application prospect with an overpotential of only 25 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Even at a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2), the overpotential is 107 mV. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the voltages of OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and UOR (urea oxidation reaction) are 1.561 V (vs. RHE) and 1.353 V, respectively. Using Ni-0(Co-0)-Ni(Co)(BO2)(2)/NF as a bifunctional catalyst for HER and UOR, only 1.47 V can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It is shown that the catalyst will greatly reduce energy consumption and decompose urea when coupling HER and UOR.

HEM electrocatalysts are usually prepared through hydrothermal reactions or calcination, which could generate undesired heterogeneous structures that hinder the exploration of the structure-property relationship of these HEM electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a sol-gel method to synthesize homogeneous HEM electrocatalysts for electro-oxidation of methanol and urea (methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR)), through an acid-catalyzed gelation at room temperature. With Ni as the primary component for MOR and UOR, Co can reduce the overpotentials, while Fe can increase the catalytic activities and durability. Borate and phosphate can tune the charge distribution in active sites and speed up the reaction kinetics through fast proton transfer. Thus, the optimal Ni2Fe0.5Co0.5-BP HEM catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic activity together with good durability and great resistance to CO poisoning. In addition, a direct methanol fuel cell with Ni2Fe0.5Co0.5-BP electrode can not only provide power, but also produce formic acid with high yield and high Faraday efficiency.

However, an urea molecule is relatively complex, containing both electron-donating amino (-NH2) and electron-withdrawing carbonyl (C=O) groups, and understanding the influence of different functional groups on the adsorption behavior is conducive to the rational design and preparation of high-performance UOR catalysts. Herein, we report a simple synthesis of the Ni3N/Mo2N heterostructure and a systematic investigation of urea-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production. Both temperature-programmed desorption and theoretical calculations decipher that -NH2 and C=O groups of the urea molecule are more easily adsorbed on Ni3N and Mo2N, respectively. Meanwhile, the Ni3N/ Mo2N heterostructure could combine and enhance the advantages of individual components, optimizing the adsorption of urea. Besides, this heterostructure is also beneficial to improving the hydrogen evolution reaction performance. As expected, in the two-electrode urea-assisted water electrolyzer utilizing Ni3N/Mo2N as bifunctional catalysts, hydrogen production can readily occur at an evidently lower voltage (1.36 V@10 mA cm-2), which is much lower than that of traditional water electrolysis, as well as 7 times higher hydrogen production rate is achieved.

This process, unfortunately, has been significantly impeded by the puzzles in either the efficient but economically unaffordable noble-metal-based catalysts or the low-cost but kinetically sluggish abundant-element-based catalysts. Particularly, the discovery of efficient bifunctional catalysts that can simultaneously trigger the reactions of both anode and cathode for overall water splitting still remains as a grand challenge. Herein, a novel low-cost bifunctional Ni2P/Ni0.96S heterostructured electrocatalyst, which is active for both the urea oxidation reaction at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, is innovated for high-efficiency overall splitting of urea-rich wastewater. A systematic configuration of a Ni foam (NF)-supported Ni2P/Ni0.96S catalyst electrode exhibits superior catalytic activity and stability. The Ni2P/Ni0.96S/NF parallel to Ni2P/Ni0.96S/NF cell needs only 1.453 V to reach a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) in basic urea-containing water, while it is 1.693 V for a reference noble-based Pt/C/NF parallel to IrO2/NF electrolysis cell. This work therefore not only contributes to develop a low-cost, high-efficiency, bifunctional electrocatalyst but also provides a practically feasible approach for urea-rich wastewater treatment.

Herein, a feather-like NiCoP supported on NF was synthesized via the two-step hydrothermal-phosphorization process. NiCoP/NF requires only overpotentials of 44 and 203 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1 M KOH, respectively. Besides, NiCoP/NF requires only 1.13 V (vs RHE) to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH containing 0.33 M urea. DFT calculation shows that NiCoP exhibits enhanced DOS in the Fermi level attachment, which promotes charge transfer. Subsequently, the trifunctional NiCoP/NF, for overall water splitting, requires a lower potential of 1.48 V to gain 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. For urea electrolysis, NiCoP/NF requires just 1.36 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea.

Therefore, we rationally designed a NiCoP catalyst with a bimetallic synergistic effect to realize the strategy of promoting the bifunctional activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) at high current density. Corresponding X-ray diffractogram (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses prove the chemical composition and successful synthesis of the NiCoP. Electrochemical activity tests indicate that the NiCoP requires a potential of 1.27 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), and shows good UOR activity. In the overall urea electrolysis (UOR parallel to HER), NiCoP can maintain the high current density of 200 mA cm(-2) for 142 hat 1.67 V. The NiCoP exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic activity and durability.

Urea assimilation and oxidation support activity of phylogenetically diverse microbial communities of the dark ocean	ISME JOURNAL												Urea is hypothesized to be an important source of nitrogen and chemical energy to microorganisms in the deep sea; however, direct evidence for urea use below the epipelagic ocean is lacking. Here, we explore urea utilization from 50 to 4000 meters depth in the northeastern Pacific Ocean using metagenomics, nitrification rates, and single-cell stable-isotope-uptake measurements with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry. We find that on average 25% of deep-sea cells assimilated urea-derived N (60% of detectably active cells), and that cell-specific nitrogen-incorporation rates from urea were higher than that from ammonium. Both urea concentrations and assimilation rates relative to ammonium generally increased below the euphotic zone. We detected ammonia- and urea-based nitrification at all depths at one of two sites analyzed, demonstrating their potential to support chemoautotrophy in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic regions. Using newly generated metagenomes we find that the ureC gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of urease, is found within 39% of deep-sea cells in this region, including the Nitrososphaeria (syn., Thaumarchaeota; likely for nitrification) as well as members of thirteen other phyla such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Plantomycetota, Nitrospinota, and Chloroflexota (likely for assimilation). Analysis of public metagenomes estimated ureC within 10-46% of deep-sea cells around the world, with higher prevalence below the photic zone, suggesting urea is widely available to the deep-sea microbiome globally. Our results demonstrate that urea is a nitrogen source to abundant and diverse microorganisms in the dark ocean, as well as a significant contributor to deep-sea nitrification and therefore fuel for chemoautotrophy.

The effective hydrogen energy production through lower energy consumption is considered as a promising approach to access the world's clean energy demand. Herein, an extraordinary bifunctional electrocatalytic activity on hydrogen energy production via urea electro-oxidation reaction in the alkaline electrolyte is evaluated by the highly dispersed tiny nickel palladium bimetallic nanoparticle-incorporated ordered mesoporous carbon (Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC). The systematic electrocatalytic studies on the Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC bifunctional electrocatalyst shows a very low required overpotentials [1.346 and -0.117 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 1 M KOH +0.33 M urea] to achieve urea electro-oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions at a respective electrocatalytic current density of 30 mA cm(-2), which is comparatively very lower overpotential than the oxygen evolution reaction (1.585 V vs RHE) in the water electrolysis system. Moreover, there is no remarkable electrocatalytic activity losses even after 5000 voltammetric cycles on urea electro-oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions. The Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits highly efficient and faster reaction kinetics on urea electrolysis than the other three individual electrocatalysts and reasonable performance with the benchmark Pt-20%@C and IrO@C catalysts. Notably, the presence of nonprecious nickel metal promotes good electron density at palladium active sites of Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC, which in turn facilitates efficient electrocatalytic reduction reactions to enhance the rate of overall urea electrolysis. Overall, the superior bifunctional ability of Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC could be an appropriate energy efficient electrocatalyst to produce clean energy from wastewater treatment and fuel cell applications.

However, the efficiency of the traditional nickel foam-based catalyst is still subject to the following two factors: the high oxidation potential of Ni3+ and the uncertainty of the oxidation and reduction active sites. Here, with the advantage of two-dimensional sheet porous high surface area, a Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet was prepared by depositing ZIF-67 to inhibit the formation of Ni3+ and maximize the space utilization. Then, the NiS/Co3S4/Ni3S2 nano heterostructure was constructed to improve the interface electronic structure and optimize the adsorption energy of the intermediates via in situ vulcanization. The NiS shell on the surface of the catalyst provides sufficient reaction sites for the catalytically active substance NiOOH generated during the UOR at a lower oxidation potential. At a current density of 50/100 mA cm(-2), the overpotential is only 1.330/1.340 V while maintaining the catalytic durability for 20 h. At the same time, the NiS/Co3S4/Ni3S2/NF nano heterostructure material shows good urea degradation performance and stability, which provides the possibility of degradation and treatment of industrial, agricultural, and domestic wastewater containing urea.					chen, yanyan/AAR-7009-2020; Wang, Wensong/GPC-5449-2022	Li, Shenjie/0000-0001-9334-0140														2574-0970				OCT 3	2024	7	20					23604	23616		10.1021/acsanm.4c03907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.4c03907		OCT 2024											WOS:001330118800001

We report a new synthetic design approach to produce an iron-nickel alloy nanocatalyst from a metal-organic polymer (MOP) by a single-step carbonization process at 500 degrees C, thus forming a core-shell of iron-nickel-coated carbon (C@ FeNi) nanostructures wired by embedded carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (CNT/C@FeNi). Powder X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of metallic FeNi3 alloy nanoparticles (similar to 20 to 28 nm). Our experimental results showed that MOP containing CNTs acquired an interconnected hierarchical topology, which prevented the collapse of its microstructure during pyrolysis. Hence, CNT/C@FeNi shows higher porosity (10 times) than C@FeNi. The electrochemical UOR in alkaline electrolytes on these catalysts was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The result showed a higher anodic current (3.5 mA cm(-2)) for CNT/C@FeNi than for C@ FeNi (1.1 mA cm(-2)) at 1.5 V/RHE. CNT/C@FeNi displayed good stability in chronoamperometry experiments and a lower Tafel slope (33 mV dec(-1)) than C@FeNi (41.1 mV dec(-1)). In this study, CNT/C@FeNi exhibits higher exchange current density (3.2 mu A cm(-2)) than does C@FeNi (2 mu A cm(-2)). The reaction rate orders of CNT/C@FeNi and C@FeNi at a kinetically controlled potential of 1.4 V/RHE were 0.5 and 0.9, respectively, higher than the 0.26 of beta-Ni(OH)(2), Ni/Ni(OH)(2) electrodes. The electrochemical impedance result showed a lower charge-transfer resistance for CNT/C@FeNi (61 Omega.cm(-2)) than for C@FeNi (162 Omega.cm(-2)), due to faster oxidation kinetics associated with the CNT linkage. Moreover, CNT/C@FeNi exhibited a lower Tafel slope and resistance and higher heterogeneity (25.2 x 10(-5) cm s(-1)), as well as relatively high faradic efficiency (68.4%) compared to C@ FeNi (56%). Thus, the carbon-coated FeNi3 core connected by CNT facilitates lower charge-transfer resistance and reduces the UOR overpotential.

The synchronization of urea electrooxidation and hydrogen production has become an increasingly attractive energy development way. However, UOR faces the challenges of relatively sluggish kinetics and catalyst activity degradation. Here, nitrogen-doped carbon fiber supported nickel phosphide (Ni5P4/NCF-400) is developed as a bifunctional self-supporting electrocatalyst, which is synthesized by electrodeposition and high temperature nitriding. The HER overpotential of Ni5P4/NCF-400 in alkaline medium is 77 mV at 10 mA cm-2, the Tafel value is 98.04 mV dec-1, and the activity does not decrease significantly after continuous hydrogen evolution for 24 h. The UOR potential is 1.376 V at 100 mA cm-2, the Tafel value is 16.45 mV dec-1, and can steadily work at 1.38 V for 48 h. Moreover, Ni5P4/NCF-400 is assembled into a water-urea electrolytic cell device, which could achieve a current density of 40 mA cm-2 at a voltage of 1.67 V and achieve the stability of the catalytic system for 24 h. The excellent electrocatalytic per-formance of Ni5P4/NCF-400 is attributed to N doping and abundant active sites.					li, hs/HNI-7007-2023; Wang, Yunlei/HZI-3220-2023; Wang, Xin/D-1945-2011														0169-4332	1873-5584				JUL 1	2023	624								157173	10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.157173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.157173		APR 2023											WOS:000975769600001

Here, we demonstrate that NiMn-LDH with sulfate anion interaction can enable urea electrooxidation with a low anodic potential of 1.36 V at 100 mA cm(-2). We find that the UOR on NiMn-LDH is driven by Ni3+ species and the Ni3+ generation is the rate-determining step of UOR. Both the Mn doping and sulfate anion interaction contribute to the low-barrier phase transformation from Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH to produce the Ni3+ state with high activity in UOR, owing to that Mn doping optimizes the electronic states and intercalation of guest anions weakens the interlayer interactions, which ultimately tunes Ni3+ generation kinetics toward the superior UOR activity. Our findings provide new insights into the design of the highly active UOR catalysts.

Bifunctional vanadium doped mesoporous Co3O4 on nickel foam towards highly efficient overall urea and water splitting in the alkaline electrolyte	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Developing more active and stable electrode materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is necessary for electrocatalytic water and urea oxidation which can be used to generate hydrogen. Here, a low-cost vanadium-doped mesoporous cobalt oxide on Ni foam (V/meso-Co/NF) electrodes are obtained via the grouping of an in-situ citric acid (CA)-assisted evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method and electrophoretic deposition process, and work as highly efficient and long-lasting electrocatalytic materials for OER/UOR. In particular, V/meso-Co/NF electrodes require 329 mV overpotential to maintain a 50 mA/cm2, with exceptional long-term durability of 30 h. Interestingly, V/meso-Co/NF also exhibits excellent electrocatalytic UOR performance, reaching 50 and 100 mA/cm2 versus RHE at low potentials of 1.34 and 1.35 V, respectively. By employing the V/meso-Co/NF materials as both the anode and cathode, this urea electrolysis assembly V/meso-Co/NF-5 (+,-) reaches current densities of 100 mA cm-2 at 1.62 V in KOH/urea, which is nearly 340 mV lesser than classical water electrolysis. The V/meso-Co/NF-5 electrocatalysts also exhibit remarkable durability for electrocatalytic OERs and UORs. The obtained findings revealed that the synthesized V/meso-Co/NF might be a promising electrode materials for overall urea-rich wastewater management and H2 generation from wastewater.

In this paper, we reported a simple preparation method for in situ growth of NiCoOOH@CuO on nickel foam by a two-step hydrothermal method to generate CoS/NiS@CuS with a dandelion-like heterostructure after a one-step sulfidation. The CoS/NiS@CuS electrode has excellent electrochemical properties for urea oxidation reactions, oxygen evolution reactions and urea electrolysis. Electrochemical performance was tested in alkaline solution, the overpotential of CoS/ NiS@CuS is only 190 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction, the potential of CoS/NiS@CuS is only 1.35 V for urea oxidation, and the overpotential of CoS/NiS@CuS is only 110 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction, which are one of the best activities reported so far. Density functional theory calculations show that CoS2 exhibits the minimum Gibbs free energy of hydrogen, which plays an important role in promoting the reaction rate. The presence of CoS2 increases the electrical conductivity of the material, and synergistic effect of NiS and CuS makes the material exhibit superior hydrogen production properties. Our work proves that transition-metal sulfides have great potential in the direction of urea splitting, which provides new ideas and directions for subsequent exploration in the direction of transition-metal sulfides. & COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Specifically, Ni-Co layered double hydroxide nanosheets are synthesized through a hydrothermal treatment, followed by the conversion of these Ni-Co-based precursors into Ni-Co bimetallic oxide slender nanosheets using a calcination method. The density of states indicates that Ni-Co bimetallic oxide can greatly enhance the conductivity compared with a single NiO for the UOR. Moreover, owing to the synergistic effect of the compositions and the unique advantages offered by the nanosheet architecture, the resulting electrocatalyst demonstrates improved performance in terms of overall urea splitting. Specifically, the Ni-Co bimetallic oxide delivers a low overpotential of 79 mV at 10 mA cm-2 with a small Tafel slope of 45.1 mV dec- 1 and exhibits long-term durability even after extensive testing.					pan, tao/IYT-3776-2023														0360-3199	1879-3487				FEB 29	2024	57						388	393		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.286		JAN 2024											WOS:001155673200001
J	Sriram, S; Nambi, IM; Chetty, R				Sriram, Saranya; Nambi, Indumathi M.; Chetty, Raghuram			Electrochemical reduction of hexavalent chromium on titania nanotubes with urea as an anolyte additive	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												The present study reports an energy efficient electrochemical strategy to remediate hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) to less toxic Cr(III). The novelty in this system is the use of titania nanotubes (TNT) synthesized by anodization as cathode for the reduction of Cr(VI) with alkaline urea as an anolyte additive. The electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI) was evaluated using bare Ti and porous TNT/Ti cathodes, both with and without urea as an anolyte additive. The experimental results showed that the dual combination of alkaline urea oxidation at anode and acidic Cr(VI) reduction on TNT cathode showed the best performance, with enhanced degradation efficiency up to 97% at 5 V within 15 min for an initial concentration of 100 mg L-1 Cr. The optimized urea-TNT combination was evaluated for the effect of catholyte pH, temperature, initial metal ion concentration and the effect of other anions, such as Cl-, NO3-, PO42- and CO32-, which are commonly present in wastewater discharged from tannery or electroplating industries. Furthermore, the performance when evaluated with cow urine as an anolyte additive confirmed that the dual combination could be a promising in-situ treatment technique for simultaneous urine oxidation and Cr(VI) reduction.

The growing demand for sustainable energy solutions necessitates cost-effective, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalysts to enable large-scale H2 production. In our study an innovative approach by introducing a novel tri-metallic hybrid electrocatalyst, CrCoSb-B was surface treated with vacuum Ar plasma for the 1st time. This approach creates a highly efficient charge transfer within the electrocatalysts structure. Boron (B) atoms are added to expedite the water -splitting process by aiding electron transfer to the metal surfaces (Cr, Co, and Sb). On the other hand, Ar plasma treatment increases the number of active catalytic sites on the electrode surface, improving water -splitting efficiency. As a result, the CrCoSb-B electrode, subjected to 2 min Ar plasma treatment, exhibits significantly reduced overpotentials of 265 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 453 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a high current density of 1000 mA/cm2 in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with the low Tafel values for HER and OER are 68 and 97 mV/dec, respectively. In bifunctional operation, the electrocatalyst achieves a low voltage of 2.01 V at 1000 mA/cm2 and demonstrates enhanced performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a voltage of 1.81 V at 1000 mA/cm2. Furthermore, it maintains stability over a 24 hrs duration and nearly 100% Faradic efficiency in both H2 and O2 production. This research reveals a promising path for developing effective electrocatalysts, leveraging interfacial interactions and vacancies to enhance their performance in green hydrogen production.

Synthesizing a series of carbon fiber paper (CFP) supported Ni(OH)(2)/MnO2 catalysts, we explored relevant redox transitions and catalysis of both UOR (urea oxidation reaction, in KOH-with-urea) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction, in KOH). Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) in KOH-only solution demonstrated a more cathodic transformation from Ni(III/IV) to Ni(II) compared with that in KOH-with-urea solution. The water oxidation overpotential was shifted to higher values (from 0.48 to 0.53 V-RHE) as the Mn:Ni atom ratio increases in CFP-NiMn films. In contrast, a higher Mn content results in higher UOR activity and lower onset potential in KOH solution containing urea (1.395-1.375 V-RHE). Quasi in-situ, freeze-quench X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ni and Mn K-edges was employed to uncover oxidation state changes as well as structural transformations at the atomic level showing that CFP-Ni(OH)(2) underwent oxidation state changes by about 1.15 e(-) and 0.21 e(-) per Ni ion during OER and UOR processes, respectively, versus only 0.71 e(-) and 0.07 e(-) per Ni ion in CFP-NiMn2.4. Mn incorporation can stabilize the Ni in lower valent states in a mixed NiMn catalyst without significant changes in oxidation state and structure. The here investigated, readily synthesized CFP-NiMn films exhibit opposite activity trends in KOH and KOH-with-urea electrolytes: Mn incorporation depresses water oxidation, but it promotes the urea oxidation process. We propose that the water oxidation rate (OER) is positively correlated with the capacity for accumulation of Ni and Mn oxidation equivalents, while the urea oxidation (UOR) rate is negatively correlated with this capacity. Our work offers a mechanistic guideline for designing and synthesizing nonprecious metal-coupled Ni-based catalysts with appropriate redox-properties for urea-oxidation applications.

J	Yang, WP; Xiao, L; Dai, WD; Mou, SY; Dong, F				Yang, Weiping; Xiao, Lei; Dai, Weidong; Mou, Shiyong; Dong, Fan			Efficient Solar Driven Upgrading of N2 to Urea Through Photoredox Reactions on Pt Cluster/TiO2	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS												Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea, are instrumental in augmenting agricultural output and addressing the demands of a growing population. Nevertheless, conventional urea production heavily relies on energy-intensive processes. In this study, an environmentally friendly photocatalytic method is proposed for directly and selectively synthesizing urea from nitrogen (N-2) and methanol (CH3OH using a Pt cluster-decorated TiO2 catalyst (Pt cluster/TiO2). Remarkably, the Pt cluster/TiO2 exhibits outstanding urea synthesis performance with a rate of 105.68 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and N-selectivity of 97.29 +/- 0.79%, representing the highest level of photocatalytic urea synthesis from N-2. Further analysis with density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the "sigma-pi*" donor-acceptor interaction occurred between Pt clusters and N-2, efficiently reducing the N-2 hydrogenation barrier. EPR experiments demonstrate that photogenerated electrons (e(-)) and hole (h(+)) are synchronously consumed through N-2 reduction and CH3OH oxidation, thereby accelerating urea synthesis. The crucial step of C & horbar;N coupling is initiated by the reaction between *NH & horbar;NH and *CHO intermediate, facilitated by the low energy barrier on Pt cluster/TiO2. This work suggests an mild route of urea production and provides profound insights into the underlying chemistry of the C & horbar;N coupling reaction, which can guide the sustainable synthesis of essential indispensable chemicals.

In this paper, composite catalysts Ni0.2Mo0.8N/CeO2-x/NF (x = n(Ce)/n(Ni)-0.1, 0.3, 0.5) were synthesized via hydrothermal and calcination methods on foam nickel (NF). Experimental results show that the composites have better properties than CeO2/NF, Ni0.2Mo0.8N/NF and MoN/CeO2/NF. The electrochemical properties of the composites depend on the ratio of nickel and cerium. A proper proportion of nickel leads to a larger specific surface area, increased electron capacity, more active sites, and better overall performance. Among the tested composites, Ni0.2Mo0.8N/CeO2-0.3/NF exhibits the best electrochemical performance and is well-suited for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution re-action (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). For HER, the potential is-120 mV @ 100 mA cm-2. And for UOR, the UOR potential is only 1.462 V @ 100 mA cm-2. A two -electrode electrolyzer of Ni0.2Mo0.8N/CeO2-0.3/NF|| Ni0.2Mo0.8N/CeO2-0.3/NF was also built. Overall urea splitting (OUS) is 1.672 V @ 100 mA cm-2, which is 187 mV smaller than overall water splitting (OWS, 1.859 V). Therefore, Ni0.2Mo0.8N/CeO2 has potential application in hydrogen production from urea-rich wastewater electrolysis.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, reducing the usage of precious metals and developing low-potential nucleophiles oxidation reaction to replace anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are efficient strategies to promote H-2 generation. Here, NiS-coated nickel-carbon nanofibers (NiS@Ni-CNFs) are prepared for low-content Pt deposition (Pt-NiS@Ni-CNFs) to attain the alkaline HER catalyst. Due to the reconfiguration of NiS phase and synergistic effect between Pt and nickel sulfides, the Pt-NiS@Ni-CNFs catalyst shows a high mass activity of 2.74-fold of benchmark Pt/C sample. In addition, the NiS@Ni-CNFs catalyst performs a superior urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity with the potential of 1.366 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2), which demonstrates the great potential in the replacement of OER. Thus, a urea-assisted water splitting electrolyzer of Pt-NiS@Ni-CNFs (cathode)||NiS@Ni-CNFs (anode) is constructed to exhibit small voltages of 1.44 and 1.65 V to reach 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than its overall water splitting process, and presents a 6.5-fold hydrogen production rate enhancement.

Atomistic insights into role of urea additive in lithium nanoparticles formation	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Recently, urea additive has been demonstrated to benefit the formation of cathode nanomaterials through spray flame synthesis with improved homogeneity in lithium atoms distribution. Nevertheless, its intrinsic mechanism has not been well understood. In this study, reactive molecular dynamic simulations are performed to gain atomistic insights into the pyrolysis and oxidation mechanisms of a lithium precursor droplet with or without urea additive. A series of comparisons involving the reaction kinetics and pathways of lithium clusters, along with the gas release, energy profiles and morphological characteristics of droplets, is conducted to elucidate the role of urea additive at 1500 K and 0.1 MPa. Urea additive is observed to exert a homogenising impact on the distribution of lithium atoms within the synthesized nanoparticles, as evidenced by the decreased number of large-sized lithium agglomerates and less concentrated lithium element. This can be ascribed to changed reaction pathways of lithium clusters due to urea additive, where the lithium clusters are prone to decompose into fine nanoparticles through initial bonding with urea atoms, followed by bond-breaking to generate gases. The increased amount of gas released from the decomposition of precursor with urea additive leads to a more violent droplet microexplosion, which in turn results in droplet breakup and thus fine droplets. As the ambient temperature is elevated, the presence of urea additive facilitates the formation of fine-sized nanoparticles with enhanced homogeneity of lithium atoms.

Developing multifunctional catalysts with high-performance toward urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) offers a unique approach for simultaneously achieving the degradation of urea- containing wastewater and energy-saving hydrogen production. Ni-based materials are a kind of promising materials for electrocatalysis, since its abundant reserve and tolerance. However, low intrinsic activity and catalytic efficiency hinder its wide application. Here, a defect engineering strategy is developed to create vacancies on NiAl layer double hydroxides (LDHs) catalysts by selectively etching Al ions in strong alkaline solution.

In addition, the D-NiAl LDHs catalysts also show excellent UOR activity using a potential of 1.328 V vs . RHE @ 10 mA cm- 2 in alkaline solution. In comparation to NiAl LDHs, the enhanced performance of D-NiAl LDHs toward oxidation of small-molecule OH-- and urea could be attributed to electronic regulation of defects and a larger electrochemical surface area.

The electrocatalysts with cost-effective, multifunctional and high-performance are urgently required for enhancing UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but this remains a challenge. Herein, we designed a bifunctional Ni (OH)x/p-Ni catalyst by electrochemical oxidation of Ni(OH)2 in -situ grown on the surface of porous Ni membrane (p-Ni) to generate more abundant high -valence Ni3+ active species, which is favorable for reducing the energy barrier of electrochemical reaction. At the same time, a large number of metallic oxygen bonds (Ni-O) were formed to optimize the reaction kinetics of the electrochemical process, thus promoting the overall urea electrolysis efficiency. In 1.0 M KOH with 0.3 M urea, the optimized Ni(OH)x/p-Ni only requires potentials of 1.38 V and 0.22 V to obtain a current density of 100 mA cm -2 for UOR and HER, respectively. Notably, by assembling the Ni(OH)x/p-Ni as the cathode and anode for hydrogen production from urea -assisted water splitting, it can drive a current density of 100 mA cm -2 at a low voltage of 1.52 V and has excellent stability.

Despite the myriad of reported materials, it is still challenging to obtain electrocatalysts in an efficient manner that can effectively integrate the electrocatalytically active species with the electrically conductive substrate. In responses to this issue, the present work reveals that amorphous NiP can be incorporated onto carbon nanotubes decorated Ni foam (CNTs/NF) substrate by a three-minute electroless plating process. The obtained NiP/CNTs/NF electrocatalyst is confirmed to undergo surface reconstruction in alkaline electrolyte forming hydrated Ni(OH)(2) nanocrystals, exhibiting promising electrocatalytic performance with high achievable current responses (similar to 400 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (21 mV dec(-1)), and large reaction rate constant (1.1 x 10(6) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)) for urea oxidation. Moreover, combining NiP/CNTs/NF and commercial Pt/C in a single device, the urea electrolyzer renders the current responses of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) at the cell voltage of 1.42, 1.60, and 1.79 V, respectively, reflecting energy-saving hydrogen production and remediation of urea-containing wastewater concurrently.

However, creating stable, effective bifunctional catalysts is still challenging. In this work, we report a novel bifunctional catalyst of core-shell structure Ni-500 Nano-particle. The carbon coating not only offers numerous active sites and facilitates rapid charge transfer but also shields the nickel core from corrosion. Moreover, By replenishing the urea concentration, the current density can be recovered and sustained for 50 h with only an 8 % decrease. It is significantly less than pure water electrolysis that the urea-assisted water electrolyzer with Ni-500 as both cathode and anode achieves cell-voltage of 1.55 V at 100 mA cm- 2. This work demonstrates the potential of Ni-500 as a inexpensive and effective catalyst for urea-based hydrogen production, and offers new perspectives into the design and optimization for core-shell structure electrocatalyst.																			0925-8388	1873-4669				OCT 15	2024	1002								175383	10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175383	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175383		JUN 2024											WOS:001282007500001
J	Medvedev, JJ; Delva, NH; Klinkova, A				Medvedev, Jury J.; Delva, Nyhenflore H.; Klinkova, Anna			Mechanistic Analysis of Urea Electrooxidation Pathways: Key to Rational Catalyst Design	CHEMPLUSCHEM												Urea electrolysis is an emerging approach to treating urea-enriched wastewater and an attractive alternative anodic process to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical clean energy conversion and storage technologies (e. g., hydrogen production and CO2 electroreduction). While the thermodynamic potential for urea oxidation to dinitrogen is quite low compared to that of the OER, the catalysts reported to date require high overpotentials that far exceed those for the OER. Consequently, there is much room for improvement and rational catalyst design for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). At the same time, due to the urea molecule having a more complex structure than water, UOR can lead to the formation of various products beyond the commonly assumed N2 and CO2. This concept article will critically assess recent efforts of the research community to decipher the formation mechanisms of UOR products focusing on the systematic analysis of the reaction selectivity. This work aims to analyze the current state of the art and identify existing gaps, providing an outlook for the future design of UOR catalysts with superior activity and selectivity by applying the knowledge of the molecular transformation mechanisms.

In this perspective, FTO/Ti-Fe2O3 (nanorods) photoelectrodes decorated with Ni as catalyst are developed and tested for urea photoelectrocatalytic oxidation under solar illumination. Gains up to 0.50 V in oxidation onset potential vs. metallic Ni are obtained thanks to a Ni photoelectrodeposition method. In situ transmission measurements (based on NiOOH light absorption) during electrochemical cycling allowed to evaluate the state of active Ni sites and confirmed that urea oxidation mechanism is of EC type. Photoelectrolyses give faradaic efficiencies of 10-18% and 9-35% for N-2 and O-2 formation, respectively. A significant and unexpected NO2 production (similar to 65%) is detected indicating another or incomplete reaction pathway. The photoelectrocatalytic removal of nitrogen from urea solutions is demonstrated but requires catalysts with higher selectivity towards N-2.

However, they cannot drive the required current density at a lower overpotential (eta) compared to other benchmark catalysts. To overcome the lack of efficient catalytic activity, Co3O4-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) is fabricated on NiO nanosheets derived from an in situ synthesized Co MOF with an electrodeposited (Ni(OH)(2)) layer. The electrocatalyst developed herein comprises many Co3+, Ni3+, and pyridinic-N-exposed active centers and exhibits an excellent synergistic effect between the metal oxide-NC-metal oxide, facilitating a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to the highly intimate contact between the electrocatalyst layers, rapid electron transfer occurs and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is produced in the HER and OER at eta of 73 and 110 mV, respectively, with excellent mass activity and high turnover frequency. However, urea-assisted water electrolysis achieves current densities of10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of just 1.31 and 1.49 V, respectively, for the two-electrode-based system, with an extremely stable durability of 212 h (1.49 V). Co3O4@NC/NiO parallel to Co3O4@NC/NiO has a considerably better urea electrolysis performance than other benchmark electrocatalysts.

Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a lower electrode potential instead of oxygen evolution reaction (OER, water-splitting anode) in the water-urea electrolysis is an energy-saving approach. In this paper, NiMoO4-Ni(OH)(2)/NF is synthesized by hydrothermal reactions and explored as both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR catalyst electrodes. This composite catalyst shows high catalytic bifunctional activities towards both HER and UOR. To validate both catalytic UOR and HER activities and durability, a two-electrode water-urea electrolyzer composed of NiMoO4-Ni(OH)(2)/NF as both anode and cathode materials is constructed (NiMoO4-Ni(OH)(2)/NF parallel to NiMoO4-Ni(OH)(2)). Experiments show that a voltage of 1.341 V with a high stability (over 3000 CV cycles) can be achieved at 10 mA cm(-2), which are much better than those obtained using a Pt/C parallel to IrO2.

Pulse electrodeposited, morphology controlled organic-inorganic nanohybrids as bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea oxidation	NANOSCALE												Organic-inorganic nanohybrids with nanoscale architectures and electrocatalytic properties are emerging as a new branch of advanced functional materials. Herein, nanohybrid organic-inorganic nanosheets are grown on carbon paper via a pulse-electrochemical deposition technique. A benzo[2,1,3]selenadiazole-5-carbonyl protected dipeptide BSeFL (BSe = benzoselenadiazole; F = phenylalanine; and L = leucine) cross-linked with Ni2+ ions (Ni-BSeFL) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) in a BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) electrode exhibits stable electrocatalytic activity toward urea oxidation. The cross-linked nanosheet morphology of nanohybrids was optimized by controlling the reduction potential during pulse electrodeposition. The BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) (-1.0 V) nanohybrid deposited at -1.0 V provides abundant active sites of Ni3+ with low charge transfer resistance (R-CT) and high exchange current density (J(0)) at the electrocatalytic interface. The nanohybrids with Ni-BSeFL and Ni(OH)(2) show low overpotential and superior stability for electrocatalytic urea electro-oxidation. The BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) (-1.0 V) nanohybrid based electrode requires a low potential of 1.30 V (vs. RHE) to acquire a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea containing alkaline solution which is lower than that for water oxidation in alkaline solution (1.49 V vs. RHE). The organic-inorganic nanohybrid BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) (-1.0 V) shows durability over 10 h for oxygen evolution and urea electro-oxidation, thereby confirming the BSeFL/Ni(OH)(2) (-1.0 V) nanohybrid-based electrode as an efficient electrocatalyst.

Herein, an organic-inorganic heterojunction electrocatalyst made of Ni(OH)2, a triazine-based covalent organic framework (COF), and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), denoted as Ni(OH)2/COF/CNT, is reported to exhibit significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance for urea oxidation in comparison with its single- and double-component counterparts (Ni(OH)2, COF/CNT, Ni(OH)2/CNT, and Ni(OH)2/COF). As revealed by its band structure analysis, the constructed Ni(OH)2-COF (p-n) heterojunction enables a built-in electric field to boost charge transfer across the heterointerface (from the inorganic Ni(OH)2 to the organic COF), resulting in significantly improved catalytic activity. The mass activity is 363 A gNi(OH)2-1 at 1.5 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) for the Ni(OH)2/COF/CNT heterojunction electrocatalyst, showing 322 and 72% enhancement in comparison with Ni(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2/CNT, respectively. Moreover, Ni(OH)2/COF/CNT exhibits a considerable turnover frequency (TOF, 0.11 s-1 at 1.5 V), large reaction rate constant (k = 1.9 x 106 cm3 mol-1 s-1), high coulombic efficiency (similar to 98%), and meritorious catalytic stability (24 hours at 20 mA cm-2) for urea oxidation. The present work enriches the design strategies for developing advanced electrocatalysts. By constructing a Ni(OH)2-COF (p-n) heterojunction, a built-in electric field can be induced to boost charge transfer across the heterointerface, thereby facilitating the generation of Ni3+ active sites for enhanced urea oxidation performance.

By replacing OER with an easier urea oxidation reaction (UOR), developing an HER/UOR coupling electrolysis system for hydrogen production could save a significant amount of energy and money. An Al-doped cobalt ferrocyanide (Al-Co2Fe(CN)6) nanocube array was in situ grown on nickel foam (Al-Co2Fe(CN)6/NF). Due to the unique nanocube array structure and regulated electronic structure of Al-Co2Fe(CN)6, the as-prepared Al-Co2Fe(CN)6/NF electrode exhibited outstanding catalytic activities and long-term stability to both UOR and HER. The Al-Co2Fe(CN)6/NF electrode needed potentials of 0.169 V and 1.118 V (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode) to drive 10 mA cm-2 for HER and UOR, respectively, in alkaline conditions. Applying the Al-Co2Fe(CN)6/NF to a whole-urea electrolysis system, 10 mA cm-2 was achieved at a cell voltage of 1.357 V, which saved 11.2% electricity energy compared to that of traditional water splitting. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the boosted UOR activity comes from Co sites with Al-doped electronic environments. This promoted and balanced the adsorption/desorption of the main intermediates in the UOR process. This work indicates that Co-based materials as efficient catalysts have great prospects for application in urea electrolysis systems and are expected to achieve low-cost and energy-saving H2 production.					yu, xueping/M-9687-2013	Peng, Juan/0000-0003-0008-4593														1420-3049				OCT	2023	28	20							7147	10.3390/molecules28207147	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules28207147								37894626					WOS:001090066400001

However, the high occupation of Ni 3d orbital leads to their constrained adsorption for reactant and multiple intermediates during UOR process. Herein, considering the d-band electron complementation, the bimetallic MoNi4 hollow nanocubes self-assembled with numerous ultrathin nanosheets was constructed by introducing molybdenum with relatively empty d orbital and synergistically boost UOR/HER activities. Notably, the MoNi4 requires a lower cell voltage of 1.462 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in urea electrolyzer, superior to that in water electrolyzer (1.796 V) and most of the reported nickel-based electrocatalysts, as well as the urea degradation rate is impressive. In situ technologies including electrochemical impedance spectroscopies and Raman spectra reveal that the favorable UOR pathway can be initiated directly by the reconstructed NiOOH species. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the urea molecular are preferential absorbed on Ni site and then collaborate with the adjacent Mo site to carry out the subsequently dehydrogenation, N-N coupling, and desorption in energetically favorable pathways, proving their dual site mechanism (synergy between Mo and Ni).

However, owing to the sluggish kinetics from a six-electron process for UOR, it is in great demand to design and fabricate high-performance and affordable electrocatalysts.

Fe2O3@CoFe-TPyP-MOF comprises unsaturated metal-nitrogen coordination sites, affording enriched defects, self-tuned d-band centers, and efficient pi-pi interaction between different layers. Density functional theory calculation confirms that the adsorption of urea can be optimized at Fe2O3@CoFe-TPyP-MOF, realizing the efficient adsorption of intermediates and desorption of the final product of CO2 and N-2 characterized by the in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The two-electrode urea-assisted water splitting device-assembled with Fe2O3@CoFe-TPyP-MOF illustrates a low cell voltage of 1.41 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), attaining the hydrogen production rate of 13.13 mu mol min(-1) in 1 m KOH with 0.33 m urea. The in situ electrochemical Raman spectra and other basic characterizations of the used electrocatalyst uncover that Fe2O3@CoFe-TPyP-MOF undergoes the reversible structural reconstruction after the UOR test, while it demonstrates the irreversible reconstruction after the OER measurement.

However, the lack of cost-efficient electrocatalysts hinders its practical application. Herein, bimetal phosphide (NiCoPx) nanowire arrays decorated with ultrathin NiFeCo metal-organic framework (NiFeCo-MOF) nanosheets on porous nickel foam (NF) were designed for urea-assisted wastewater splitting. The core-shell NiCoPx@NiFeCo-MOF hybrids were prepared via successive hydrothermal, gas-phase phosphorization and hydrothermal strategies. Encouragingly, the novel NiCoPx@NiFeCo-MOF/NF electrode served as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea-assisted water splitting, which merely required an overpotential of 44 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and a voltage of 1.37 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for UOR in 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M urea. Benefiting from the highly exposed electroactive sites in exquisite three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure, multi-component synergistic effect, accelerated electron transfer, easy electrolyte access and diffusion of released gas bubbles, the as-fabricated NiCoPx@NiFeCo-MOF/NF exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance. The mechanism of water splitting was elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Interestingly, NiFeCo-MOF possessed optimized COO* adsorption ability on Ni sites that were beneficial to UOR intermediates. More significantly, this work paves the way for the design and fabrication of bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea-containing wastewater treatment and sustainable hydrogen production.

Herein, cerium-incorporated Ni2P nanosheets are designed as trifunctional electrocatalysts to generate hydrogen by hydrothermal self-oxidation of surface nickel foam (NF) in pure water to in-situ form Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, followed by incorporation of Ce and phosphorization. The prepared material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). When the current density is 100 mA cm-2, the UOR potential of Ce-Ni2P is 1.473 V lower than that in the OER (1.731 V), suggesting a great potential to replace the sluggish OER for overall water splitting. Moreover, the Ce-Ni2P/NF can be applied to the electrochemical treatment of real urine electrolysis with similar performance to the urea electrolysis. Such remarkable performance is attributed to the incroporation of Ce with "Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pairs", which can not only provide abundant reactive sites by the charge transfer appearance of defect sites, but also offer an effective buffering space for the pre-oxidation process from Ni2+ to Ni3+. It is thus beneficial for overall water splitting and coupled urea electrolysis, providing a promising candidate for urine wastewater treatment and clean energy production. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wu, N; Chi, XY; Zhang, YJ; Hu, TP				Wu, Na; Chi, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Yujuan; Hu, Tuoping			Convenient synthesis and enhanced urea oxidation of NiO-CrO@N-C	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can be used as the anode reaction of urea direct fuel cells and for the treatment of urea-containing wastewater. However, to improve the kinetics of the UOR, the development of efficient and cheap catalysts is a key problem to be solved. In this study, mesoporous catalysts (NiO-CrO@N-C) of amorphous NiO and CrO nanoparticles anchored in nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) were prepared using a sol-gel combined with self-propagating combustion method. Electrochemical tests show that the optimal NiO-CrO@N-C sample has excellent performance against the UOR, that is, the driving voltage is only 1.37 V vs. RHE at a current density (j) of 10 mA cm-2. After 8 h long-term CA testing, the j retention rate is 83% relative to the initial value. The excellent performance of the as-prepared sample is mainly due the strong electron interaction between Cr and Ni atoms, which is conducive to the formation of Ni3+, its mesoporous structure, which is helpful for electron transport and electrolyte diffusion, and its amorphous structure, which provides more UOR active sites. The NiO-CrO@N-C composite, which was synthesized by amorphous NiO and CrO nanoparticles anchored on an N-containing carbon matrix, presents excellent activity and stability for the electrocatalytic oxidation of urea.																			1144-0546	1369-9261				MAR 25	2024	48	13					5621	5626		10.1039/d3nj05877h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d3nj05877h		FEB 2024											WOS:001180111700001

It not only can reduce energy consumption caused by the high overpotential of OER but also simultaneously removes the urea present in polluted water, having a huge potential in industrial applications. Ni- and Fe-based transition metal hydroxides have been shown to be significantly effective in OER and urea oxidation reactions (UORs). Herein, by using FeCoNi layered double hydroxide (FeCoNi-LDH) nanorods as the precursor, we successfully develop the Prussian blue analogue (PBA)/FeCoNi-LDH nanorods grown uniformly on the surface of nickel foam (NF). The obtained electrocatalyst PBA/ FeCoNi-LDH/NF nanorods as the anode could provide a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at the applied potential of 1.383 V in 1.0 M KOH solution with 0.5 M only 1.52 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) to afford the same current density. The high conductivity and 3D porous structure created by the Ni substrate can lead to superior electrocatalytic activity. Nanoarrays are constructed intimately with the base and allow the rapid escape of newly produced gas molecules, and a large number of active sites and rapid charge transfer can be induced by the introduction of sodium nitroprusside.					gu, peiyang/HJH-4059-2023; lu, jm/JPK-3675-2023; Jin, Liujun/AHB-8216-2022; Chen, Dongyun/K-3095-2018; He, Jinghui/A-6813-2017	Chen, Dongyun/0000-0003-0083-1843; He, Jinghui/0000-0002-0093-8897														2574-0970				NOV 26	2021	4	11					12407	12414		10.1021/acsanm.1c02864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.1c02864													WOS:000752894100104
J	Wang, YH; Zhang, DB; Du, XQ; Zhang, XS				Wang, Yanhong; Zhang, Dabin; Du, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Xiaoshuang			Controlled synthesis of Co3O4@CoP heterostructured nanoarrays as efficient electrocatalysts in alkaline seawater and urea	FUEL												How to prepare clean energy has always been a problem to be solved by the modern green chemical industry. Compared with the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen, electrolysis of seawater for raw material requirements are lower and more widely used. However, the lacks of maturity of the technology, the high cost and the generation of harmful gases such as chlorine in the electrocatalytic process have hindered the development of this process. This study demonstrates a construction of heterogeneous structure based on Co ions as an efficient multifunctional catalyst for overall seawater splitting and urea oxidation. This hybrid structure can combine nanosheets and nanowires, thus exposing the catalyst to more active sites and shortening the ion diffusion path. Comparing the hybrid structure with the single structure, Co3O4@CoP exhibits excellent multifunctional catalytic activity in alkaline seawater and urea. In the oxygen evolution reaction, the working potential is only 1.60 V and 1.70 V at a current density of 50 mA/cm2 and 100 mA/cm2. And in the hydrogen evolution reaction, the working potential was only -0.16 V at a current density of -10 mA/cm2, demonstrating excellent bifunctional activity. On this basis, the catalyst also demonstrated excellent activity for urea oxidation reaction in alkaline environment, with an operating potential of only 1.28 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. And the durability of this catalyst is good, it can keep 5 mA/cm2 for 12 h under the constant voltage of 1.45 V, but the initial potential falls off too fast, and there is a decline in performance, which is closely related to the corrosion of Cl- present in seawater. It was shown by density functional theory (DFT) that hierarchical nanostructures can increase the transfer rate of reaction intermediates and the water adsorption energy. At the end of this study, by comparing single nanostructures with hybrid nanostructures, it can be reasonably conjectured that the accompanying increase in the number the heterostructure is resistant to Cl- corrosion in seawater.																			0016-2361	1873-7153				JUL 1	2024	367								131510	10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131510		MAR 2024											WOS:001221868100001

The samples were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, XRD, SEM, Raman, XPS, UV-vis, FTIR, pyridine-FTIR and TPR techniques. The catalytic activity in ethyl acetate total oxidation as a representative of VOCs was tested. The effect of preparation procedure on the texture, structure, morphology, acidic and redox properties was discussed in details in close relation with mixed oxides composition and possibilities for fine tuning of their catalytic activity. As compared to urea procedure, the hydrothermal treatment provides more homogeneous insertion of Zr ions within cubic ceria lattice even at high Zr content. As a result higher degree of distortion of the cubic lattice, creation of Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies and an increase in both Lewis acidity and redox ability is observed and these properties are not affected by the presence of template during the synthesis. The differences in the redox and surface acidic properties of both series of materials probably promote the realization of the catalytic process by various reaction pathways and thus influence in a complex way the catalytic activity and selectivity.

However, the activation and decomposition of urea molecule maintains a challenge during electrocatalytic process because of its 6e- oxidation procedure. Herein, Ni nanoparticles decorated NiMoOx nanorod (Ni/NiMoOx) electrocatalyst with abundant heterojunction interfaces is fabricated and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation testifies that the interfaces are favorable for enhancing the conductivity and modulating the surface polarization of Ni/NiMoOx, thus improving its UOR's activity. The Ni/NiMoOx performs superb electrocatalytic capacities toward UOR with a potential of 1.355 V (vs RHE) at 20 mA cm-2, and HER with an overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA cm-2. A hybrid two-electrode water splitting cell is further assembled via applying the Ni/NiMoOx as both anodic and cathodic electrodes with presence of 0.33 M urea, delivering 50 mA cm-2 at voltage of 1.589 V. The findings help to provide a reliable strategy for rational reconstruction of Ni based metal oxide with rich interfaces for diverse electrocatalytic reactions.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, nickel foam supported three-dimensional (3D) nickel-organic framework nanosheet arrays (Ni-BDC-t/NF, where t is the reaction time) comprising Ni2+ and an organic ligand of 4,4-biphenyl dicarboxylic acid (BDC) are synthesized as catalyst for urea electrolysis in alkaline media. Benefiting from the highly exposed Ni active sites and fast electron transfer rate endowed by 3D nanosheet array architecture, the structurally optimized Ni-BDC-10/NF exhibits preeminent electrocatalytic activity and durability toward urea oxidation reaction (UOR). To deliver a high current density of 100 mA cm-2, the required UOR potential of Ni-BDC-10/NF is only 1.50 V vs. RHE. Significantly, by further coupling with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction, the urea electrolysis system based on Ni-BDC-10/NF self-supporting anode exhibits a dramatic voltage decrease by 340 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm-2 as compared with that of water electrolysis under the same conditions.

The use of La2NiO4 perovskite is advantageous with relatively low weight percentage of Ni (14.6%) compared to other Ni-based catalysts for electrooxidation of urea. The perovskite catalyst is synthesized using microwave-assistedmethod that reduces chemicals and energy consumption. Perovskite-based catalyst has good ionic and electronic conducting behavior, high oxygen mobility within its lattice with remarkable charge transfer rate. Carbon nanotubes increase the surface area of the electrode and act as a catalyst support to enhance the urea conversion process. Under optimized conditions, the specific current for urea electrooxidation is 1400 mA mg(-1) cm(-2). The perovskite catalyst and the (PANI/LNO-CNT) composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis (SEM-EDAX). The composite is applicable in temperature range (10 degrees C to 50 degrees C), and at different urea concentrations (0.1Mto 1.0M) in basic (KOH) electrolyte. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The VSB-5 nanorods exhibited open-framework structure, nanoporosity with a pore diameter of about 1 nm, and typical molecular sieves with zeolitic properties, making them a promising catalyst material for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). A catalyst layer of reticulated VSB-5 nanorods grown on the nickel foam could provide abundant micro-, meso-, and macro-scale pores for hosting electrolyte and expediting the movement of electron, electrolyte, and gaseous products. Electrochemically active surface area (EASA) of the VSB-5 electrode with unique pore structure was considerably greater than that of the nickel hydroxide electrode with granular particles and dense interior. Large EASA and high valence state of nickel species accounted for the superior electrocatalytic performance of the VSB-5 electrode towards UOR compared with the nickel hydroxide electrode. The VSB-5 electrode exhibited higher current density (160 mA cm(-2)) at 0.6 V vs. SCE (saturated calomel electrode) and lower onset potential (0.27 V vs. SCE) than the nickel hydroxide electrode (75 mA cm(-2) and 0.28 V) obtained from the cyclic voltammograms.																			0169-4332	1873-5584				NOV 1	2020	529								147175	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147175													WOS:000562943800004

However, developing cost-effective and highly active catalysts remains a challenge. In this study, a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst of Ni-Zn bimetallic nanosheets (ZnO-Ni2P) was synthesized on Ni foam (NF) for efficient urea decomposition in urea-containing wastewater. The results showed that inactive ZnO phase acted as an "electron pump", which facilitated electron redistribution between Ni and P atoms and created localized vacancies of Ni and P cations. This optimized electronic configuration enhanced the kinetics of both the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, a unique particle-porous structure with abundant grain boundaries was achieved through the utilization of the Kirkendall Effect and Ostwald Ripening. In an alkaline urea electrolysis system, the alkaline urea electrolyzer assembled with ZnO-Ni2P/NF sample as both electrodes exhibited a low driving potential of only 1.424 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which outperformed the commercial noble metal-based electrolyzer (RuO2||Pt/C). The results verify that incorporating an inactive phase to manipulate the electronic structure of the active phase can be an effective strategy in developing catalysts for urea electrolysis.

J	Koçak, G; Erbas, SÇ				Kocak, Gazde; Erbas, Seyil Celik			Preparation and characterization of strontium aluminate/urea-formaldehyde composite: a solution for oxidation-induced darkening problem	PIGMENT & RESIN TECHNOLOGY												Purpose This study aims to produce homogenously prepared polymer composites by adding two different strontium aluminate derivatives (Sr4Al14O25 and SrAl2O4) to urea-formaldehyde (UF) at different mass concentrations. In the context of this work those strontium-based derivatives were compared in terms of mechanical and luminescent characteristics. Additionally, sodium bicarbonate was integrated with the prepared composites to eliminate/minimize darkening problem, which might arise from the oxidation of Eu +2 to Eu2O3, on the surface of strontium aluminate/urea-formaldehyde composites. Design/methodology/approach In this study, strontium aluminate/UF composite materials were produced using a compression molding technique. Their mechanical, thermomechanical and luminescence properties were investigated via various characterization methods. Particle size analysis was used to characterize phosphor derivatives, whereas scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) was conducted for morphological examination. Findings The darkening problem was prevented by the introduction of sodium bicarbonate into the composite systems. Based on the characterization and test results, the only addition of strontium aluminate reduced the mechanical properties. However, it was seen that the introduction of sodium bicarbonate into the composites improved those properties positively. The appropriate amounts of strontium aluminate and sodium bicarbonate were determined by conducting an experimental optimization study.

Enhanced water and urea electrolysis at industrial scale current density using self-supported VxNi1-xO trifunctional catalysts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												An advance of highly efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts based on non-noble metals for water electrolysis and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are of great significance for urea-enriched wastewater remediation and producing hydrogen. Herein, we report VxNi1-xO catalysts supported on three-dimensional Ni-foam scaffold for catalytic water and urea electrolysis. VxNi1-xO catalysts show rapid water and urea electrolysis due to enhanced electrochemical surface area (ECSA). Most important of all, the urea oxidation reaction has a lower potential of 1.418V vs RHE as compared to oxygen evolution reaction (1.684 V vs RHE) system to generate 100 mA/cm2. Additionally, a two-electrode cell for bi-functional water electrolysis generates 100 mA/cm2 at a potential of 2.10 V at 20 degrees C and just 1.86 V at 60 degrees C temperature due to regulated the adsorption/desorption of intermediates species, enhanced charge and mass transport, and easier desorption of oxygen molecules from the anode. The stability of VxNi1-xO catalyst was measured at 1000 mA/cm2 current density for up to 17 h.					Sumesh, C.

Sulfonamide antibiotic removal and nitrogen recovery from synthetic urine by the combination of rotating advanced oxidation contactor and methylene urea synthesis process	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The combination of nitrogen recovery and pharmaceutical removal processes for livestock urine treatment were investigated to suppress the discharge of pollutants and recover nitrogen as resources. We combined methylene urea synthesis from urea and adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition of sulfonamide antibiotic using rotating advanced oxidation contactor (RAOC) contained for obtaining both safe fertilizer and reclaimed water. The methylene urea synthesis could recover urea in synthetic urine, however, almost all sulfonamide antibiotic was also incorporated, which is unfavorable from a safety aspect if the methylene urea is to be used as fertilizer. Conversely, RAOC could remove sulfonamide antibiotic without consuming urea. It was also confirmed that the methylene urea could be synthesized from synthetic urine treated by RAOC. Thus, we concluded that RAOC should be inserted prior to the nitrogen recovery process for effective treatment of urine and safe use of methylene urea as fertilizer.

In theory, nickel-based catalysts exhibit superior activity in this regard. However, the intrinsically low conductivity and limited active sites on usual nickel-based catalysts impede their applications in UOR. Hence, a hierarchical triple-layered heterostructure, which consists of MnCo2O4.5 nanosheets seamlessly sandwiched between a bottom layer of Ni foam substrate and a top layer of Ni (OH)(2) nanosheets, are directly synthesized via a successive hydrothermal-calcination-hydrothermal process (MnCo2O4.5@Ni(OH)(2)/NF). Taking advantages of the distinctive sandwich structure and the synergistic effect between MnCo2O4.5 and Ni(OH)(2), the resulting MnCo2O4.5@Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrode presents superior electrocatalytic activity with a small onset potential of 0.19 V versus Ag/AgCl as well as a current density of 650 mA cm(-2) in 5M KOH and 0.33M urea electrolyte.

Thermodynamics of electrochemical urea oxidation reaction coupled with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution: Effect of carbonate formation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												The development of efficient and energy-saving electrochemical processes for "green" hydrogen generation represents one of the most crucial challenges in modern chemistry and technology. An effective approach to realizing such processes involves alkaline water electrolysis with cathodic hydrogen evolution coupled with anodic urea oxidation reaction. As extensively reported in the literature, this configuration allows for a significant reduction in cell voltage. In this work, we present thermodynamic analysis of the electrochemical reaction CO(NH2)(2) + 2OH(-) +/- 6e(-) = 3H(2) + N-2 + CO32-, for the first time accounting for the inevitable carbonate formation due to interaction of carbon dioxide with alkali. Standard changes in enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy, as well as the electromotive force were calculated over the temperature range of 298-338 K. The influence of pH on the electromotive force value was investigated. It was observed that the process under study is accompanied by heat release and an increase in entropy, becoming thermodynamically spontaneous at pH > 12.66. From a thermodynamic point of view, this suggests exceptionally favorable energy characteristics for the studied process, promoting the development of an energy-efficient "green" hydrogen generation technology. Additionally, we demonstrate that increasing the temperature further enhances the thermodynamic features of this reaction by reducing the energy consumption for its progression.

Herein, we found that the high-valent Ni species induced by the inactive MoO2 in mixed nanocrystals of NiO/MoO2 were effective for urea oxidation. The redox interaction of MoO2 and NiO revealed by the spectroscopic analysis well supported the formation of high-valent Ni species and the changes in the surface chemical state. High catalytic activity and stability for urea oxidation were observed by a series of electrochemical measures compared to the counterpart catalysts of MoO2 and NiO. The optimal NiO/MoO2 hybrid catalyst showed a UOR activity of 73.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.50 V, which was about 12-fold that of the NiO catalyst. In addition, largely improved catalytic kinetics and catalytic stability for UOR were also demonstrated. Because of the inactive activity of MoO2 and the low performance of NiO, the largely improved preference can be affirmatively attributed to the efficient catalytic synergism of NiO/MoO2 in the mixed nanocrystals. The current finding clarifies the catalytic promotion effect of the inactive Mo species on Ni-based catalysts for urea oxidation, which would be instructive for Ni/Mo-relevant catalyst development.

The as-prepared membranes exhibited the highly interconnected, homogeneously distributed and smooth surfaced PVdF-HFP nanofibers, in which the face centered cubic nickel (Ni)/Ni-cobalt (Ni-Co) nanoparticles were uniformly anchored. The Ni:Co(0.5:0.5) content in PVdF-HFP nanofibers exhibited the excellent electrochemical properties toward urea electrooxidation as substantiated from the higher anodic current and lower onset potential in comparison with the other compositions of Ni and Co prepared under the similar conditions. Under the optimized conditions, PVdF-HFP/Ni-Co(0.5:0.5) membrane showed the superior electrochemical performances toward non-enzymatic urea detection, offering the rapid response time, lower detection limit, high sensitivity and wide linear range of 5 s, 12 mu M, 2.4 mu AmM-1 cm(-2) and 20 mu M - 2 mM, respectively. Owing to the robust frameworks, excellent electrical conductivity, large surface area and extended active sites of PVdF-HFP/Ni-Co(0.5:0.5) membrane, the constructed urea sensor exhibited an excellent stability and favorable reproducibility toward urea oxidation and also endowed its applications in human urine samples with the analytical reliability. These findings embrace the unique strategy for the fabrication of freestanding and binder free electrodes and construct the new possibilities toward the utilization of electrospun polymeric electrodes in urea electooxidation and its precise detection.

However, the lack of inexpensive and effective electrocatalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) hampers its widespread use. Herein, hierarchically porous and ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) nanostructures in situ grown onto nickel foam (Ni(OH)(2)@NF) are developed as efficient and durable electrocatalysts for UOR via a simple and cost-effective ultrasonic/heating-assisted activation strategy. The ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) nanostructures comprise highly active surfaces and rapid diffusion pathways for active species; meanwhile, the excellent electrical conductivity of the NF skeletons effectively improves the charge transfer of the catalyst. Consequently, this Ni(OH)(2)@NF electrode exhibits excellent urea catalytic activity (low oxidation potential of similar to 1.35 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and has remarkable operational stability (potential increase by only 0.22% after 40 h of durability testing) that is superior to most UOR catalysts. By employing the freestanding electrode as the anode and commercial Pt/C supported on NF as the cathode, this two-electrode urea electrolysis cell exhibited a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage (1.45 V, 250 mV below a urea-free counterpart) with a robust durability (>40 h). This work provides a valuable insight for designing scalable and high-performance UOR electrocatalysts, which are promising for utilization in energy-efficient H-2 production.					liao, yu/AGT-1991-2022; wu, yi/LZG-1397-2025; Xu, Han/JOZ-1851-2023	/0000-0003-1327-7685; Liao, Yu/0000-0002-2004-1884; Xu, Han/0000-0002-3211-7081													2574-0962					MAR 23	2020	3	3					2996	3004		10.1021/acsaem.0c00122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.0c00122													WOS:000526598300103

Nevertheless, an efficient and robust catalyst is required to surmount the kinetic limitations of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In this regard, we demonstrate a facile process for depositing Cu3P microspheres on the nickel foam. Based on the results of the post-UOR character-ization of Cu3P, it appears that during UOR, Cu3P was subjected to in-situ surface oxidation to yield a Cu3P@CuOx heterostructure containing a catalytically active amorphous layer of CuOx supported in a conducting Cu3P matrix. As a UOR electrocatalyst, Cu3P was even superior to the RuO2, and it generated a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 at 1.37 and 1.4 V, respectively, with a Tafel slope of 29 mV dec-1. Cu3P displayed a turnover frequency of 1.42 x 10-3 s- 1 at 1.4 V, indicating its high intrinsic catalytic activity.

Urea electrocatalysis holds great potential for accomplishing energy-saving hydrogen production and simultaneously relieving urea-rich sewage stress, but its real mechanism is still controversial and the lack of efficient catalysts with sustainable stability limits its further application. In this work, vertical self-supported Ni3S2 nanosheets with boosted activity and better durability were synthesized on the nickel foam. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal a novel mechanism different from most other nickel-based catalysts that Ni3S2 spontaneously reconstructs into surface hydroxyl ligands and directly participates in the decomposition reaction of urea to ammonia, in which hydroxyl-modified Ni sites possess strong binding ability with urea derivatives to further improve self-stability; and an oxidation reaction of urea to N-2 provides electrons for maintaining ultra-low potential to avoid the formation of unfavorable NiOOH. Impressively, hydroxyl-modified Ni3S2 requires only 1.339 V to afford 100 mA cm(-2), opening up brand-new avenues for the development of urea electrocatalysis with higher nitrogen recycle efficiency and stability.

Ex situ technology verifies amorphous electro-active/inert NiOOH/ZnO derived from surface conversion of crystalline KNZF-31, which synergistically drive the UOR. Theoretical calculation indicates that Zn-doping in KNiF3 promotes the OH- adsorption and charge transfer of Ni2+-site and formation of surface NiOOH electroactive species, which optimizes subsequent urea adsorption and charge transfer of Ni3+-site and desorption of CO2 on NiOOH/ZnO hetero-interface.

Development of bifunctional electrocatalysts is the crucial link in urea-assistant water electrolysis. Here, a novel composite consisting of the bimetallic phosphide nanosheets and porous Ni3S2 nanospheres was prepared by a hydrothermalelectrodeposition method. It proves that the NF/CoFeP@Ni3S2 electrode exhibits an outstanding performance for HER/UOR (HER overpotential is 173 mV and EUOR is 1.358 V, 100 mA cm- 2). As for a two-electrode system taking NF/CoFeP@Ni3S2 as cathode and anode in urea medium, the voltage at 100 mA cm-2 is just 1.454 V. Even in human urine electrolyte, just only a slight current decrease is observed. Both in urea and urine, the voltage of NF/CoFeP@Ni3S2 remain stable during a 50-hour continuous operation. The formation of heterostructures between the bimetallic phosphides and Ni3S2, and Fe addition realize the gradual improvement in activity from the pristine CoP to CoFeP and then to the CoFeP@Ni3S2. This strategy provides a practical hetero-structured catalyst design form considering the structure properties of urea molecule for the efficient water-hydrogen conversion synchronous sewage treatment.

In this study, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to investigate the crystalline properties, shape structure, and functional group characterization of CuO/NiO composites. The typical morphology of the prepared materials consisted of irregular nanoparticles arranged into clusters of less than 200 nanometers in size. In spite of this, the CuO/NiO composites showed monoclinic CuO and cubic NiO phases and were therefore successfully synthesized. It was observed that rotten banana fruit juice had a significant impact on the particle size and crystal quality of CuO/NiO composites. This was due to the presence of capping, reducing, and stabilizing agents in banana fruit juice. Under alkaline conditions, the CuO/NiO composites were found to be highly electro catalytically active toward the oxidation of urea. Sample 2, which was prepared by adding 1.2 g of CuO decorated with NiO, showed a linear increase in urea detection ranging from 0.1 mM to 17 mM, with a limit of detection of 0.004 mM. Furthermore, sample 2 of the CuO/NiO composite demonstrated exceptional stability, selectivity, and reproducibility. Consequently, sample 2 of CuO/NiO could effectively detect urea in spinach, lotus root, milk, and curd. The improved performance of sample 2 of the CuO/NiO composite can be attributed to its favorable surface properties, which contain enriched active sites and a rapid charge transfer rate.

In this work, NiMoSe ternary nanospheres were deposited on nickel foam (NiMoSe/NF) by one-step electrodeposition. The morphology, phase and chemical composition of the electrode was characterized by using SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS. The electrode exhibited excellent performance for both urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It only required 1.39 V and 81 mV (vs. RHE) to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for UOR and HER, respectively. The electrolyzer constructed with NiMoSe/NF as both anode and cathode could deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at a driving potential of 1.44 V. The stability test showed that the electrode had good durability as electrode for both UOR and HER. Considering the easiness, simplicity and low cost, the NiMoSe/NF electrode could find wide application in urea electrolysis. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The electrochemical performance of the catalyst was assessed under alkaline conditions, demonstrating remarkably low potentials of 1.43 V and 1.38 V for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) at 100 mAcm(-2) and 10 mAcm(-2) and overpotentials of 103 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm(-2), along with a modest Tafel slope of 92 mV/dec. The catalyst also showed good stability over a 15-h test period. Comparative analysis indicated that our Zr-MnS/Ni3S2@NF catalyst outperformed competitors, largely because of the synergistic effects of heterojunction for MnS/Ni3S2 and the Zr doping. This strategy enhanced the conductivity of catalyst, optimized the electron configuration at reaction centres, and improved the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen production, thereby accelerating reaction dynamics and achieving high electrochemistry activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further supported our findings, revealing that Zr doping increases the exposure of active Ni3S2 sites, optimizes Gibbs free energies of intermediates, and enhances intrinsic activity. Overall, this research offers valuable insights into the cooperative enhancement of electrochemistry performance, paving the way for advanced applications in urea splitting and beyond.																			0360-3199	1879-3487				OCT 28	2024	88						313	321		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.09.193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.09.193		SEP 2024											WOS:001320523500001

The Ni3S2@NF electrode exhibited excellent activity for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which can deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at 0.36 V (vs SCE) for UOR in the electrolyte of 1.0M NaOH and 0.33M urea. The Ni3S2@NF electrode also exhibited excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which shows decent stability and catalytic performance with an overpotential of similar to 127 mv at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0M NaOH. The excellent catalytic activity for both UOR and HER renders the Ni3S2@NF an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production. As a result, the two-electrode system assembled with Ni3S2@NF can drive 20 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.49 V with excellent longevity.

The honeycomb-like copper/cuprous oxide film with an increased pore size from bottom to top was prepared using hydrogen bubbles as dynamic templates in cathodic deposition, which exhibited catalytic capability towards the electrochemical oxidation of urea (EOU). After electrodeposition of an ultrathin nickel hydroxide layer around the copper/cuprous oxide dendrites, the oxidation current density and onset potential of EOU could be much improved when compared to the bare dendritic copper/cuprous oxide electrode and nickel hydroxide-supported SS mesh. The enhanced catalytic performance could be attributed the three-dimensional porous copper/cuprous oxide film with supported nickel hydroxide layer that facilitated the transport of electron, electrolyte, and reactants and the release of gaseous products through the unique pore channels.

However, challenges persist due to sluggish reaction kinetics and complex by-products separation. To this end, we introduce the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), propelling a novel UOR route using a modified CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst termed CFRO-7. Theoretical calculations and in -situ characterizations highlight the activated lattice oxygen (O-L) within CFRO-7 as pivotal sites for UOR, optimizing the reaction pathway and accelerating the kinetics. For the urea overall electrolysis application, the LOM route only requires a low voltage of 1.54 V to offer a high current of 100 mA cm(-2 )for long-term utilization (>48 h). Importantly, the by-product NCO- is significantly suppressed, while the CO2/N-2 separation is efficiently achieved. This work proposed a pioneering paradigm, invoking the LOM pathway in urea electrolysis to expedite reaction dynamics and enhance product selectivity.

This was conducted using a diesel engine with various oxidation catalysts, such as a diesel oxidation catalyst and a diesel particulate filter. The after-treatment system was equipped with urea-selective catalytic reduction (SCR) using a commercially available V2O5/TiO2 catalyst and an AOC to prevent ammonia slip. The performance of the system, after treatment, was tested under various engine loads and urea injection conditions. The operating conditions that were applied included abnormal operation of urea-SCR in the presence of abundant NH3 due to excessive spraying of urea. At 400 degrees C to 450 degrees C, and a high load, the diesel engine produced undesirable reactions at V2O5/TiO2 based urea-SCR, causing emission of excess N2O. Additionally, under identical operating conditions, the AOC with Pt metal increased the emissions of NO, NO2, and N2O via oxidation of NH3. Excess emission of NO increases the total amount of NOx, including NO2. However, undesirable oxidation of NH3 at the AOC was significantly decreased at 460 degrees C.

Amino Acid Oxidation Increases with Dietary Protein Content in Adult Neutered Male Cats as Measured Using [1-<SUP>13</SUP>C]Leucine and [<SUP>15</SUP>N2]Urea	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION												Background: Cats are unique among domestic animals in that they are obligate carnivores and have a high protein requirement. However, there are few data on protein turnover and amino acid (AA) metabolism in cats. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dietary protein content on urea production and Leu metabolism in cats. Methods: Eighteen neutered male cats (4.4 +/- 0.41 kg body weight, aged 4.6 +/- 0.41 y) fed to maintain body weight for 3 wk with 15%, 40%, or 65% metabolizable energy intake as crude protein (CP) had (1-C-13)Leu administered in the fed state. Urea production was measured by the infusion of [N-15(2)]urea. Leu flux, nonoxidative Leu disposal (NOLD; protein synthesis), Leu rate of appearance (R-a; protein degradation), and Leu oxidation were determined. Results: Urea production and Leu oxidation were both similar to 3 times greater in cats fed 65% CP compared with those fed 15% CP, whereas those fed 40% CP were similar to 1.6 times greater (P < 0.05). Leu flux was 1.9 and 1.3 times greater in cats fed 65% CP compared with those fed 15% and 40% CP (P < 0.001). Almost 39% of total Leu flux was oxidized by cats fed 15% CP, whereas this increased to 58% in cats fed 65% CP (P < 0.002). There were no differences for Re, but cats fed 65% CP tended to have 30% greater NOLD (P = 0.09) and to be in positive protein balance (P = 0.08) compared with those fed 15% CP. Conclusion: The high protein requirement of cats combined with a low rate of whole-body protein synthesis ensures that an obligate demand of AAs for energy or glucose (or both) can be met in an animal that evolved with a diet high in protein with very little or no carbohydrate.

J	Gunawan, D; Toe, CY; Sun, KW; Scott, J; Amal, R				Gunawan, Denny; Toe, Cui Ying; Sun, Kaiwen; Scott, Jason; Amal, Rose			Improved carrier dynamics in nickel/urea-functionalized carbon nitride for ethanol photoreforming	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Photoreforming has been shown to accelerate the H-2 evolution rate compared to water splitting due to thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation. In addition, the potential to simultaneously produce solar fuel and value-added chemicals is a significant benefit of photoreforming. To achieve an efficient and economically viable photoreforming process, the selection and design of an appropriate photocatalyst is essential. Carbon nitride is promising as a metal-free photocatalyst with visible light activity, high stability, and low fabrication cost. However, it typically exhibits poor photogenerated charge carrier dynamics, thereby resulting in low photocatalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate improved carrier dynamics in urea-functionalized carbon nitride with in situ photodeposited Ni cocatalyst (Ni/Urea-CN) for ethanol photoreforming. In the presence of 1 mM Ni2+ precursor, an H-2 evolution rate of 760.5 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and an acetaldehyde production rate of 888.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) were obtained for Ni/Urea-CN. The enhanced activity is ascribed to the significantly improved carrier dynamics in Urea-CN. The ability of oxygen moieties in the urea group to attract electrons and to increase the hole mobility via a positive shift in the valence band promotes an improvement in the overall carrier dynamics. In addition, high crystal-linity and specific surface area of the Urea-CN contributed to accelerating charge separation and transfer. As a result, the electrons were efficiently transferred from Urea-CN to the Ni cocatalyst for H-2 evolution while the holes were consumed during ethanol oxidation. The work demonstrates a means by which carrier dynamics can be tuned by engineering carbon nitride via edge functionalization. [GRAPHICS] .

Using urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to replace OER has been a feasible and energy-saving approach because of its lower electrode potential. Furthermore, UOR is also an important process in wastewater treatment. This paper successfully synthesizes a high-performance bifunctional catalyst for urea electrolysis. The catalyst is nickel nitride bead-like nanospheres array supported on Ni foam (Ni3N/NF).

Systematic characterization proved that NiCoVx-LDH/NF-y (x: 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5; y (the amount of H2O2 used): 50, 100, and 200) composites featured vertically interlaced LDH nanosheets with more highly valent metal species Ni3+ and Co3+. Especially, NiCoV1.0-LDH/NF-100 demonstrated the best electrocatalytic performance for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, the NiCoV1.0-LDH nanosheet arrays were in situ grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) uniformly modified Ni foam (similar to 135 nm x 15 nm), only requiring a low potential of 1.33 V for the UOR and a low overpotential of 70 mV for the HER to offer 10 mA cm(-2). When it is used as both the cathode and anode in urea-assisted water electrolysis, the as-prepared array only requires 1.45 V to offer 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming many non-precious metal catalysts. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations showed that V-doping coupled H2O2 pre-oxidation can regulate the electronic environment of the catalyst via (1) producing more highly valent Ni3+ active sites and Co3+ auxiliary sites; (2) reducing the adsorption energy of urea at the Ni site in the UOR and simultaneously reducing the water adsorption energy and water dissociation energy in the HER, especially the active site of H* adsorption was shifted from Co sites to V sites, which optimized the Gibbs free energy of H* adsorption; and (3) reducing the band gap, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics of the UOR and HER. Additionally, the synergistic coupling between NiCoV-LDH and rGO further improved the electrocatalytic performance.

Owing to their special characteristics such as abundant cation compositions, high entropy stabilization, chemical and thermal stability, and lattice distortion effect, they have drawn ever-increasing attention for various applications. However, very few studies have been reported for catalytic application, and developing HEOs with large surface areas for efficient catalytic application is still in infancy. Herein, we design nanostructured HEO of (FeNiCoCrCu)(3)O-4 using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sacrificial templates to achieve a large surface area, high density of exposed active sites, and more oxygen vacancies. Single-crystalline phase HEOs with surface area as large as 206 m(2) g(-1) are produced and further applied as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from enhanced oxygen vacancies and a large surface area with abundant exposed active sites, the optimized HEO exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward UOR with a very low potential of 1.35 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and showed long-term stability for 36 h operation, making a significant catalytic performance over previously reported HEOs. Moreover, the HEO demonstrated an efficient catalytic performance toward OER with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). The excellent catalytic activity is ascribed to the starting MOF precursor and favorable high-entropy effect.

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a convenient, stable, and eco-friendly route for producing hydrogen whose performance can be enhanced via the rational structure design of catalysts and the replacement of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, 3D hierarchically structured NiMo microrod arrays was constructed on Ni foam where ZnO served as core and support (NiMo@ZnO/NF), which showed a high activity when used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER and UOR. It only required potentials of -110 mV and 1.405 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) towards HER and UOR, respectively. NiMo@ZnO/NF was used as both the anode and cathode to construct a symmetric electrolyzer that was used for water splitting and urea electrolysis. The cell voltage decreased from 1.718 V to 1.549 V at 10 mA cm(-2) after substituting the OER with UOR. Finally, the coupled NiMo@ZnO/NF parallel to NiMo@ZnO/NF system can be driven by an AA battery in an alkaline solution containing urea, which demonstrates a practical and effective method for producing hydrogen assisted by anodic urea oxidation.

However, the reason for nitrite accumulation, the period of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) suppression, and the main NOB species for nitrite removal behind urea fertilization have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, four laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted to simulate urea fertilization in agricultural soils. We found that within 36 h of urea application, nitrite oxidation lagged behind ammonia oxidation, leading to nitrite accumulation and increased N2O emissions. However, after 36 h, NOB activity recovered and then removed nitrite, leading to reduced N2O emissions. Urea use resulted in an N2O emission rate tenfold higher than ammonium. During incubation, Nitrobacter-affiliated NOB growth decreased initially but increased later with urea use, while Nitrospira-affiliated NOB appeared unaffected. Chlorate suppression of NOB lasted longer, increasing N2O emissions. Urease inhibitors effectively reduced N2O emissions by slowing urea hydrolysis and limiting free ammonia production, preventing short-term NOB suppression. In summary, short-term NOB suppression during urea hydrolysis played a crucial role in increasing N2O emissions from agricultural soils. These findings revealed the reasons behind the surge in N2O emissions caused by extensive urea application and provided guidance for reducing N2O emissions in agricultural production processes.

More impressively, the overall water-urea electrolysis only requires 1.6 V to deliver 100 mA cm(-2) and reduces the overall energy consumption by 12.2 % in 1 M KOH with a 0.33 M urea.

In this study, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is employed as a sacrificial template to synthesize NiCo alloy nanowires (NiCo(SDS)/CC), and the instinct formation mechanism is investigated. It is found that SDS can inhibit the Ostwald ripening during hydrothermal and calcination processes, which could release abundant active cobalt, thereby modulating the electronic structure to promote the catalytic reaction. Moreover, SDS as a sacrificial template can induce the deposition of metal atoms and increase the specific surface area of the catalyst, providing abundant active sites to accelerate the reaction kinetics. As expected, the NiCo(SDS)/CC exhibits good activity for both UOR and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and it requires only 1.31 V and -86 mV to obtain a current density of +/- 10 mA cm -2, respectively.

In practice, the strategy for designing a transition metal sulfides (TMSs) phosphides (TMPs) electrocatalyst coupled with interfacial engineering applied into hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a extremely desirable and meaningful challenge. Herein, crystalline/amorphous heterostructure denoted as NiFeS@NiMoP/NF was made. Electrochemical tests show that :NiFeS@NiMoP/NF was active for both the HER and UOR process, which may due to the synergistic effect of Ni-based sulfides together with phosphides markely facilitated electron transfer and reaction kinetics and crystalline/amorphous structure provided ample unsaturated coordination configurations to enhance the adsorption of reactants. Impressively, NiFeS@NiMoP/NF displays comparatively low overpotential with value of 56.4 mV for HER and potential of 1.32 V for UOR to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm -2 , and drives the overall splitting of urea -water electrolysis at 1.40 V in 1.0 M KOH +0.5 M urea at 10 mA cm -2 .

Herein, taking NiMoO4 nanorods for example, we demonstrated the advantages of the microwaveassisted hydrothermal synthesis method compared to the traditional hydrothermal approaches. Both monoclinic structured NiMoO4 in the nanorods morphology are found for these samples but it is more time-saving and efficient in the Ni-Mo synergism for the catalyst obtained by microwave-assisted hydrothermal syntheses method. When evaluated for urea oxidation, the current density can reach 130.79 mA/cm(2) at 1.54 V, about 2.4 times higher than that of the counterpart catalyst (54.08 mA/cm(2)). Moreover, largely improved catalytic stability, catalytic kinetics and rapid charge transfer ability are found on the catalyst obtained by the microwave-assisted approach. The high catalytic performance can be attributed to the high surface area and active site exposure of NiMoO4 nanorods formed by microwave irradiation.

However, the UOR suffers from intrinsically sluggish kinetics due to its six-electron, proton-coupled nature, underscoring the need for the development of highly efficient catalysts. In this work, we have meticulously probed the urea oxidation activities over Ni single-atom doped Cu2O (Ni-Cu2O) and elucidated their underlying mechanisms. The Ni single atom substituted a copper atom on the surface/subsurface of Cu2O:{110}(Cu) and Cu2O:{111}(O). The theoretical calculation results demonstrated that the Ni-Cu2O:{110}(Cu) configuration exhibits optimal urea adsorption energy, which is conducive to effectively activating the urea molecule and lowering the energy barriers of the subsequent dehydrogenation and nitrogen-nitrogen coupling. The enhanced catalytic performance is primarily due to the synergistic interplay between the surface copper atoms and the single nickel atom within the Ni-Cu2O:{110}(Cu) structure. This synergy facilitates the activation of nitrogen in urea by the nickel atom, while the copper atoms robustly adsorb oxygen from urea, collectively modulating the pi-electron distribution within the urea molecule to activate N-H and C-N bonds. Remarkably, the overpotential for urea oxidation on this catalyst is only 0.29 V, establishing it as an exemplary candidate for urea electrooxidation. Our research not only unveils the cooperative mechanism intrinsic to Ni-doped Cu2O for urea oxidation but also paves the way for innovative approaches in designing advanced electrocatalysts.

However, because of the slow kinetics of UOR, its potential application for commercial use remains untapped.

Strategies for optimizing urea removal to enable portable kidney dialysis: A reappraisal	ARTIFICIAL ORGANS												Background: Portable hemodialysis has the potential to improve health outcomes and quality of life for patients with kidney failure at reduced costs. Urea removal, required for dialysate regeneration, is a central function of any existing/potential portable dialysis device. Urea in the spent dialysate coexists with non-urea uremic toxins, nutrients, and electrolytes, all of which will interfere with the urea removal efficiency, regardless of whether the underlying urea removal mechanism is based on urease conversion, direct urea adsorption, or oxidation. The aim of the current review is to identify the amount of the most prevalent chemicals being removed during a single dialysis session and evaluate the potential benefits of an urea-selective membrane for portable dialysis. Methods: We have performed a literature search using Web of Science and PubMed databases to find available articles reporting (or be able to calculate from blood plasma concentration) > 5 mg of individually quantified solutes removed during thrice-weekly hemodialysis sessions. If multiple reports of the same solute were available, the reported values were averaged, and the geometric mean of standard deviations was taken. Further critical literature analysis of reported dialysate regeneration methods was performed using Web of Science and PubMed databases. Results: On average, 46.0 g uremic retention solutes are removed in a single conventional dialysis session, out of which urea is only 23.6 g. For both urease- and sorbent-based urea removal mechanisms, amino acids, with 7.7 g removal per session, could potentially interfere with urea removal efficiency. Additionally for the oxidation-based urea removal system, plentiful nutrients such as glucose (24.0 g) will interfere with urea removal by competition. Using a nanofiltration membrane between dialysate and oxidation unit with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of similar to 200 Da, 67.6 g of non-electrolyte species will be removed in a single dialysis session, out of which 44.0 g are non-urea molecules. If the membrane MWCO is further decreased to 120 Da, the mass of non-electrolyte non-urea species will drop to 9.3 g. Reverse osmosis membranes have been shown to he both effective at blocking the transport of non-urea species (creatinine for example with similar to 90% rejection ratio), and permissive for urea transport (similar to 20% rejection ratio), making them a promising urea selective membrane to increase the efficiency of the oxidative urea removal system. Conclusions: Compiled are quantified solute removal amounts greater than 5 mg per session during conventional hemodialysis treatments, to act as a guide for portable dialysis system design. Analysis shows that multiple chemical species in the dialysate interfere with all proposed portable urea removal systems. This suggests the need for an additional protective dialysate loop coupled to urea removal system and an urea-selective membrane.

Urea Electro-Oxidation Reaction Enhancement via Magneto-Electrocatalysis on Nickel-Iron Oxide Nanoring Catalysts	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS												The application of magnetic fields has recently emerged as an advanced strategy to enhance electrocatalytic reactions. The influence of an alternate magnetic field (AMF) with amplitudes varying from 14.9 to 88.9 mT and frequency of 224 kHz in the urea electro-oxidation reaction (UER) on nickel nanoparticles (Ni), iron oxide magnetic nanorings (FeMNR), and Ni-FeMNR was investigated in this work. Transmission electron microscopy images showed iron oxide with the morphology of nanoring and nickel nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 3 nm. X-ray diffraction analysis showed characteristic peaks of magnetite, metallic nickel, and nickel oxide. Magnetization-field (M-H) curves recorded at 300 K showed that FeMNR and Ni-FeMNR present ferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism behavior. The results from chronoamperometric measurements showed that the AMF with amplitudes from 44.8 to 88.9 mT had a huge impact on the UER on the Ni-FeMNR catalyst, resulting in increases of obtained current in the process from 1.2 to 47%. An exponential dependence of the current from the UER and the AMF amplitude was observed. The substantial enhancement of the current obtained during the UER on Ni-FeMNR catalysts under the influence of the AMF can be mainly associated with the local heating generated that boosted the UER on nickel nanoparticles.

Nickel-based catalysts are regarded as highly promising electrocatalysts for the UOR. However, their effectiveness is significantly hindered by the unavoidable self-oxidation reaction of nickel species during UOR. To address this challenge, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high-energy interfacial heterostructure. This heterostructure incorporates Ag at the CoOOH@NiOOH heterojunction interface, where strong interactions significantly promote the electron exchanges at the heterojunction interface between -OH and -O groups. Consequently, the improved electron delocalization leads to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2, promoting a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*. The resulting catalyst, Ag-CoOOH@NiOOH, demonstrates ultrahigh UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33 V at 100 mA cm-2. The fabricated catalyst exhibits a mass activity over 11.9 times greater than the initial cobalt oxyhydroxide. The rechargeable urea-assisted zinc-air batteries (ZABs) achieve a record-breaking energy efficiency of 74.56 % at 1 mA cm-2, remarkable durability (1000 hours at a current density of 50 mA cm-2), and quick charge performances.

Removal of urea from dilute streams using RVC/nano-NiOx-modified electrode	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC), a high surface area electrode (40 cm(2)/cm(3)), has been modified with nickel oxide nanoparticles (nano-NiOx) and used for electrochemical oxidation of urea from alkaline solution. For the cyclic voltammetry measurements, the used dimensions are 0.8 cm x 0.8 cm x 0.3 cm. The purpose was to offer high specific surface area using a porous open network structure to accelerate the electrochemical conversion. NiOx nanoparticles have been synthesized via an electrochemical route at some experimental conditions. The morphological, structural, and electrochemical properties of the RVC/nano-NiOx are characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and potentiostatic measurements. The fabricated electrode, RVC/nano-NiOx, demonstrates high electrocatalytic activity towards urea oxidation in an alkaline electrolyte. The onset potential of the RVC/nano-NiO(x )compared to that of the planar GC/NiOx is shifted to more negative value with higher specific activity. The different loadings of the NiOx have a substantial influence on the conversion of urea which has been evaluated from concentration-time curves. The urea concentration decreases with time to a limit dependent on the loading extent. Maximum conversion is obtained at 0.86 mg of NiOx per cm(3) of the RVC matrix.

This electrochemical deposition helps achieve a uniform and stable anode coating, which exhibits the high catalytic activity and stability, resulted in significantly enhanced urea oxidation reaction. The research further identifies an optimal performance for a single cell at 25 degrees C with 9 M KOH and 0.5 M urea, achieving a peak power density of 46.38 mW/cm(2). The single cell demonstrates an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.72 V. Both energy and exergy efficiencies are further investigated for the cell performance and found to be 58% and 24%, respectively, at 5 M KOH. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results reveal a significant reduction in impedance, from 30-Omega cm(2) at 25 degrees C to 15-Omega cm(2) at 65 degrees C, indicating an enhanced ionic conductivity and a reduced resistance. The present study results suggest that optimizing the electrode composition and operational parameters significantly improves the DUHPFC's performance, offering valuable insights for future fuel cell development.

This work presents the in situ preparation of holey NiFe-LDH nanosheets on Ni foam (H-NiFe-LDH/NF) via a one-step hydrothermal method in the presence of PEO-PPO-PEO as the soft template. The holey NiFe-LDH nanosheets provide a high electrochemical surface area, more edge catalytic sites, and abundant oxygen vacancies. Consequently, HNiFe-LDH/NF exhibits excellent catalytic activity to oxygen evolution, urea oxidation, and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER, UOR, and HER) with good stability in alkaline electrolytes. This electrode requires an overpotential of 261 mV for the OER, a potential of 1.480 V for the UOR to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm-2 in alkaline solutions. By employing the self-supported electrode as both the anode and cathode, this electrolysis cell (H-NiFe-LDH/NF||H-NiFe-LDH/NF) gains current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 at low cell voltages of 1.575 and 1.933 V in the 1.0 M KOH solution. After adding 0.33 M urea, the voltages to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm-2 respectively decrease to 1.418 and 1.691 V. The HNiFe-LDH/NF electrode also shows excellent stability for water-splitting and urea electrolysis. This work not only contributes to developing a low-cost, high-efficiency, bifunctional electrocatalyst but also provides a practically feasible approach for urea-rich wastewater electrolysis.

However, the electrolyzer assembled with highly efficient anode and cathode still remains a critical challenge. Herein, NiCo MOFs grown in situ on nickel foam (NiCo MOF/NF) were selected as the common precursor to conveniently prepare two well-targeted electrocatalysts for anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The NiCo MOF/NF after electrochemical activation (NiCo MOF/NF-EA) in 1.0 M KOH displayed a prominent UOR catalytic activity with an ultra-low potential of 1.280 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). The NiCo MOF/NF after phosphorization (NiCoP/NF) exhibited a high HER activity with a low overpotential of 63 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The overall urea solution electrolyzer assembled with superior NiCo MOF/NF-EA and NiCoP/NF showed an excellent performance with a voltage of 1.447 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a good long-term stability during 24 hour test. The strategy using the same precursor to conveniently synthesize different and optimal electrocatalysts for each electrode and assembling them together is effective for constructing efficient urea solution electrolyzer and worth extensive investigation.

Herein, we develop a bifunctional electrocatalyst comprising RuNi alloy nanoparticles anchored on fluorine-doped NiMoO4 nanorods (RuNi-F-NiMoO4), engineered for efficient hydrogen production from seawater and urea oxidation reactions. The strategic F doping effectively reduces the difference in work functions and modulates the electronic interactions between the RuNi alloy and the NiMoO4 substrate, enhancing electron transfer kinetics and significantly improving electrocatalytic activity and stability. Notably, the RuNi-F-NiMoO4 exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction performance in both alkaline freshwater (248 mV at 1 A cm(-2)) and alkaline seawater (277 mV at 1 A cm(-2)), enabling industrial-scale high-current-density hydrogen production and maintaining durability over 1,000 h at 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline seawater. Furthermore, RuNi-F-NiMoO4 achieves a current density of 1 A cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.59 V during the urea oxidation reaction, and facilitates a complete urea total cracking system operating at 1.88 V at 1 A cm(-2) in alkaline seawater, thereby reducing energy consumption for hydrogen production.

In this study, bitter gourd peel biomass waste is utilized to modify and structurally transform nickel oxide (NiO) nanostructures during the low-temperature aqueous chemical growth method. As a result of the high concentration of phytochemicals, the surface was highly sensitive to urea oxidation under alkaline conditions of 0.1 M NaOH. We investigated the structure and shape of NiO nanostructures using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In spite of their flake-like morphology and excellent crystal quality, NiO nanostructures exhibited cubic phases. An investigation of the effects of bitter gourd juice demonstrated that a large volume of juice produced thin flakes measuring 100 to 200 nanometers in diameter. We are able to detect urea concentrations between 1-9 mM with a detection limit of 0.02 mM using our urea sensor. Additionally, the stability, reproducibility, repeatability, and selectivity of the sensor were examined. A variety of real samples, including milk, blood, urine, wheat flour, and curd, were used to test the non-enzymatic urea sensors. These real samples demonstrated the potential of the electrode device for measuring urea in a routine manner.

However, the slow anode reaction of water electrolysis is the bottleneck of limiting the efficient hydrogen production. Therefore, it is a key problem to explore an efficient and economical electrocatalyst to assist the anode reaction. Herein, a series of self-supporting M-NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 (M=Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) nanostructures grown on a nickel foam (NF) skeleton were prepared through one-step hydrothermal strategy. In this process, doping engineering is employed to adjust the electronic structure of catalyst and improve the performance of the catalyst. Among them, the introduction of Fe not only greatly changed the morphology, but also provided rich active sites. Specifically, the Fe-NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 electrode can achieve current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 159 and 210 mV in alkaline media for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition, driving current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea only requires the ultra-small voltage of 1.37 and 1.39 V (vs. RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), indicating that UOR can well replace OER to reduce electrical energy consumption. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations (DFT) demonstrate that the superior activity of the catalyst can be attributed to the optimal water adsorption energy, faster electron transfer rate, more active site exposure and good electrical conductivity. This work extends the application of doping engineering in water electrolysis and provides a novel preparation method of efficient catalyst for OER and UOR. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

J	Fan, JF; Du, XQ				Fan, Jianfeng; Du, Xiaoqiang			Role of Ce in the enhanced performance of the water oxidation reaction and urea oxidation reaction for NiFe layered double hydroxides	DALTON TRANSACTIONS												Atomic doping and surface engineering are regarded as a promising method for improving their electrochemistry performance toward the water oxidation reaction and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for layered double hydroxides (LDHs) containing low cost transition metals. However, the mechanism of how foreign ion doping and interface construction enhance catalytic activity remains unclear. In this work, NiFe LDH is reported as an example where Ce (Ce-NiFe LDH) is doped or the interface is constructed with Ce(OH)(3)(Ce(OH)(3)@NiFe LDH), and water oxidation and urea oxidation reaction are used as probe reactions. The Ce(OH)(3)@NiFe LDH material shows superior electrocatalytic performance for the water oxidation reaction (at an overpotential of 220 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and urea oxidation reaction (at a potential of 1.40 V@10 mA cm(-2)), which is one of the best electrocatalytic performances reported so far. After a long time of stability testing, it was found that the catalytic current had significant attenuation, and further characterization showed that the surface of the electrode would be oxidized to oxyhydroxide, which is the true active species. The experimental results demonstrate that foreign Ce and Fe atom doping and interface construction improve the exposure of active centres, enhance the electron transfer rate and reduce the impedance of the NiFe LDH material. It is worth noting that this work provides new ideas for designing efficient, stable and environmentally friendly catalysts for water splitting and urea oxidation by means of doping and interface construction.																			1477-9226	1477-9234				MAY 31	2022	51	21					8240	8248		10.1039/d2dt00862a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2dt00862a		APR 2022						35578808					WOS:000796413400001
J	Shen, H; Wei, TR; Ding, JY; Liu, XJ				Shen, Hui; Wei, Tianran; Ding, Junyang; Liu, Xijun			Copper Phosphide Nanowires as High-Performance Catalysts for Urea-Assisted Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Medium	MATERIALS												Water electrolysis represented a promising avenue for the large-scale production of high-purity hydrogen. However, the high overpotential and sluggish reaction rates associated with the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) posed significant obstacles to efficient water splitting. To tackle these challenges, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) emerged as a more favorable thermodynamic alternative to OER, offering both the energy-efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the potential for the treating of urea-rich wastewater. In this work, a two-step methodology comprising nanowire growth and phosphating treatment was employed to fabricate Cu3P nanowires on Cu foam (Cu3P-NW/CF) catalysts. These novel catalytic architectures exhibited notable efficiencies in facilitating both the UOR and HER in alkaline solutions. Specifically, within urea-containing electrolytes, the UOR manifested desirable operational potentials of 1.43 V and 1.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) to reach the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Concurrently, the catalyst displayed a meager overpotential of 60 mV for the HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, the two-electrode urea electrolysis system, exploiting the designed catalyst as both the cathode and anode, demonstrated an outstanding performance, attaining a low cell voltage of 1.79 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Importantly, this voltage is preferable to the conventional water electrolysis threshold in the absence of urea molecules. Moreover, our study shed light on the potential of innovative Cu-based materials for the scalable fabrication of electrocatalysts, energy-efficient hydrogen generation, and the treatment of urea-rich wastewater.

Herein, La and S co-doped multiphase electrocatalyst (LSFN-63) is fabricated by metal-corrosion process. FeOOH can reduce the formation energy of NiOOH, and enhance the stability of NiOOH as active sites for OER/UOR. The rich oxygen vacancies can increase the number of active sites, optimize the adsorption of intermediates, and improve electrical conductivity. Beyond, La and S co-doping can also regulate the electronic structure of FeOOH. As a result, LSFN-63 presents a low overpotential of 210/450 mV at 100/1000 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope (32 mV dec(-1)), and outstanding stability under 1000 mA cm(-2)@60 h, and can also display excellent OER activity with 180 mV at 250 mA cm(-2) and long-term catalytic durability at 250 mA cm(-2)@135 h in 30 wt% KOH under 60 & DEG;C. Moreover, LSFN-63 demonstrates remarkable UOR performance in 1 m KOH + 0.5 m urea, which just requires an ultra-small overpotential of 140 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), and maintain long-term durability over 120 h. This work opens up a promising avenue for the development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts by a facile metal-corrosion strategy.																			1613-6810	1613-6829				NOV	2023	19	46								10.1002/smll.202303250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202303250		JUL 2023						37464564					WOS:001027938900001
J	Wu, MS; Sie, YJ; Yang, SB				Wu, Mao-Sung; Sie, Yi-Jhan; Yang, Shi-Bao			Hollow mesoporous nickel dendrites grown on porous nickel foam for electrochemical oxidation of urea	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												The macroporous nickel foam (NF) with attached hollow mesoporous nickel dendrites (NF@p-Ni) was prepared through electrochemical deposition of copper-nickel dendrites on the NF (NF@CuNi) followed by selective removal of the copper cores. The deposition process under high cathodic current density in an acidic solution favored the formation of hydrogen bubbles which acted as a template for the subsequent growth of macroporous dendritic copper-nickel film with 10 mm scale pores. The copper appeared to play an important part in the growth of dendritic shape and hollow porous structure on the porous and conductive NF framework. In the electrochemical oxidation of urea, the NF@p-Ni electrode could offer abundant electroactive sites and porous channels for increasing the oxidation current density and efficiency compared to the NF@CuNi electrode. The NF@p-Ni electrode featuring macroporous catalyst layer of hollow dendrites on highly conductive NF framework expedited the charge-transfer reaction of urea electrooxidation and the evolution of gaseous products. Thus, the current density and efficiency of NF@p-Ni could reach 141 mA cm(-2) and 82%, respectively, higher than those of NF@CuNi (110 mA cm(-2) and 72%, respectively) in catalyzing the electrochemical oxidation of urea molecules at 0.60 V versus saturated calomel electrode.

Modulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts through constructing metal-semiconductor heteminterface represents an effective strategy to promote the electrochemical performances. Herein, we construct a Mott-Schottky bifunctional electrocatalyst by in-situ growth of NiS/MoS2 hetero-nanoflowers on the conductive carbon cloth (CC) substrate (abbreviated as NiS/MoS2@CC hereafter) for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Thanks to the Mott-Schottky effect, the self-driven charge transfer occurs across the NiS/MoS2 heterointerfaces, which results in the built-in electric field, the accelerated charge transfer rate, and the modified chemisorption free energies for reaction intermediates, ultimately expediting the dissociation of water and urea molecules. Consequently, the as-fabricated NiS/MoS2@CC electrode only requires an overpotential of 87 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH and a potential of 1.36 V for UOR in 1.0 M KOH solution with 0.5 M urea to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, when served as the free-standing anode and cathode simultaneously, the NiS/MoS2@CC-assembled urea electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of 1.46 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is 200 mV smaller than that of the pure water splitting counterpart. This study may deepen the understanding of electronic modulation via Mott-Schottky establishment.

A template-assisted method for synthesizing TiO2 nanoparticles and Ni/ TiO2 nanocomposites for urea electrooxidation	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The exploration of electrocatalytic urea -assisted wastewater treatment as a method for sustainable energy generation presents a compelling approach within the domain of green chemistry. In this context, titanium dioxide (TiO2) and nickel -doped TiO2 (Ni@TiO2) nanocomposites were developed through an innovative organic template -assisted synthesis strategy. These were denoted as m-TiO2-org and Ni@m-TiO2-org, respectively, to create cost-effective and high-performance electrodes for urea electrooxidation in urea -based fuel cells. The structural and chemical properties of the fabricated m-TiO2-org and Ni@m-TiO2-org materials were meticulously analyzed using a suite of physicochemical characterization techniques, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and Energy -Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). These investigations revealed that both m-TiO2-org and Ni@m-TiO2-org materials predominantly consisted of irregular monolithic microparticles formed through the aggregation of spherical nanoparticles, with diameters ranging from 8.16 nm to 13.1 nm. Subsequent evaluations of these TiO2-based materials as electrocatalysts for urea electrooxidation demonstrated their efficacy, as evidenced by voltammetric and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Notably, the Ni@m-TiO2-org variant exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance, attributed to the presence of Ni2+ sites. These sites facilitated electrochemical activation and the formation of active NiOOH sites, leading to a significant increase in the current density (0.78 mA/cm2 at 1.523 V vs. the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE)), as a fiftyfold enhancement compared to mTiO2-org@Glassy Carbon Electrode (GCE) under similar conditions (3 M KOH containing 3 M urea), with a Tafel slope of 33 mV/decade. This research not only elucidates the potential of TiO2-based nanocomposites in the electrooxidation of urea but also heralds the development of innovative electrode materials for commercial electrochemical cells, marking a significant advancement in the field of electrocatalysis and sustainable energy technology.

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure with uniform NiSe2/MoSe2 Mott-Schottky heterojunction nanoneedle arrays densely grown on carbon cloth was designed and fabricated by a hydrothermal method followed by selenization treatment. In the UOR process, NiSe2/MoSe2 undergoes surface reconstruction into a Mo-NiOOH/NiSe2 composite structure, and Mo-doping can optimize the adsorption/desorption of UOR intermediates. In the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, the directed electron transfer brought by the Mott-Schottky heterojunction can modulate the electronic structure and optimize the d-band center, thus promoting HER. The well-designed NiSe2/MoSe2 as a bifunctional catalyst for urea-assisted electrolysis can reach 10 mA cm-2 at only 1.44 V with almost no performance degradation for 48 h.

Structure and electrochemical activity of nickel aluminium fluoride nanosheets during urea electro-oxidation in an alkaline solution	RSC ADVANCES												An electrocatalyst of potassium nickel aluminium hexafluoride (KNiAlF6) nanosheets has been prepared using solid-phase synthesis at 900 degrees C. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and conductivity studies confirmed the formation of KNiAlF6 nanosheets having a cubic defect pyrochlore structure with an average thickness of 60-70 nm and conductivity of 1.297 x 10(3) S m(-1). The electrochemical catalytic activity of the KNiAlF6 nanosheets was investigated for urea oxidation in alkaline solution. The results show that the KNiAlF6 nanosheets exhibit a mass activity of similar to 395 mA cm(-2) mg(-1) at 1.65 V vs. HRE, a reaction activation energy of 4.02 kJ mol(-1), Tafel slope of 22 mV dec(-1) and an oxidation onset potential of similar to 1.35 V vs. HRE which is a significant enhancement for urea oxidation when compared with both bulk Ni(OH)(2) and nickel hydroxide-based catalysts published in the literature. Chronoamperometry and impedance analysis of the KNiAlF6 nanosheets reveal lower charge transfer resistance and long-term stability during the prolonged urea electro-oxidation process, particularly at 60 degrees C. After an extended urea electrolysis process, the structure and morphology of the KNiAlF6 nanosheets were significantly changed due to partial transformation to Ni(OH)(2) but the electrochemical activity was sustained. The enhanced electrochemical surface area and the replacement of nickel in the lattice by aluminium make KNiAlF6 nanosheets highly active electrocatalysts for urea oxidation in alkaline solution.

Herein, amorphous NiMoO4 decorated Ni3S2 grown on nickel foam (Ni3S2-NiMoO4/NF) is prepared to accelerate UOR and HER. The crystalline-amorphous heterostructure could regulate the interfacial electron structure to reduce the electron density near Ni3S2 for optimizing UOR and HER. The decoration of NiMoO4 enhances its anti-poisoning ability for CO-intermediate species to show good stability at high current densities. Meanwhile, the nano-/microstructure with high hydrophilicity improves mass transfer and the accessibility of electrolyte. Driving high current densities of +/- 1000 mA cm-2, it merely needs 1.38 V (UOR) and -263 mV (HER). For urea electrolysis, it can deliver 1000 mA cm-2 at 1.73 V and stably operate at 500 mA cm-2 for 120 h.

More impressively, the proposed electrocatalyst demonstrates robust stability of more than 25 h at a current density of 50 mA center dot cm(-2) with a negligible decrease in activity. In addition, density functional theory calculations reveal that the interface engineering within the heterostructure is beneficial for the adsorption and activation of urea molecules and the improvement of the sluggish UOR dynamics. The dissociation of adsorbed CO(NH2)(2)* into CO* and NH* intermediates on the heterostructured NiMn LDH is also facilitated by electronic coupling with NiCo2S4, resulting in superior UOR performance.

Water electrolysis is a promising technique used for clean hydrogen generation. Usually, the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) and urea-oxidation reaction (UOR) processes play a vital role in hydrogen production and pollution control. Herein, we report the fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) crystalline/amorphous heterostructure NiTe/Ni-S electrocatalyst grown on nickel-foam (NF) via facile two steps (i.e., hydrothermal and electrodeposition) strategy. The synthesized NiTe/Ni-S catalyst exhibits an excellent performance toward the OER with a small overpotential of 216 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1.0 M KOH. Further, it only requires a small voltage of 1.315 V (vs. the reversible-hydrogen-electrode (RHE)) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) current density for UOR in 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, and reveals excellent long-term catalytic stability. Moreover, the overall water splitting experiments were conducted in 1 M KOH electrolyte with the NiTe/Ni-S catalyst as an anode and Pt/C as a cathode. It is obvious that only 1.500 and 1.527 V is required to achieve a current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Current studies indicate that the high-valence metal ions that are locally enriched in the catalysts or generated in situ during the anodic preoxidation process are active species for EORs. Hence, designing (pre)catalysts with enriched local active sites and boosted preoxidation is of great importance. In this work, with a focus on improving the EOR performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), we fabricated a lattice-disordered high-entropy FeCuCoNiZn hydroxide nanoarray catalyst that exhibits robust bifunctional OER and UOR behavior. The high-entropy feature could bring in a unique catalytic ensemble effect and remarkably improve the intrinsic OER/UOR activity. The lattice-disordered structure could not only enrich the local high -valence metal ions as active sites but also provide abundant reactive surface sites to accelerate the pre -oxidation process, thus leading to enriched active sites for the OER and UOR. Benefitting from the struc-tural merits, the lattice-disordered high-entropy catalyst exhibits excellent OER and UOR activity with low overpotential, large current density and enhanced intrinsic activity, and no performance degradation but dramatic 35.3% and 88.7% enhancement in activity can be achieved during the long-term OER and UOR tests, respectively. The robust OER and UOR performance makes the lattice-disordered high- entropy catalyst a promising candidate for overall and urea-assisted water electrolysis from industrial, agricultural and sanitary wastewater.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

The new era of the "hydrogen energy economy" involving urea electrolysis can efficiently promote the development of a low-carbon future. In recent decades, numerous inexpensive and fruitful nickel-based materials (metallic Ni, Ni-alloys, oxides/hydroxides, chalcogenides, nitrides and phosphides) have been explored as potential energy saving monofunctional and bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis in alkaline solution. In this review, we start with a discussion about the basics and fundamentals of urea electrolysis, including the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and then discuss the strategies for designing electrocatalysts for the UOR, HER and both reactions (bifunctional). Next, the catalytic performance, mechanisms and factors including morphology, composition and electrode/electrolyte kinetics for the ameliorated and diminished activity of the various aforementioned nickel-based electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis, including monofunctional (UOR or HER) and bifunctional (UOR and HER) types, are summarized. Lastly, the features of persisting challenges, future prospects and expectations of unravelling the bifunctional electrocatalysts for urea-based energy conversion technologies, including urea electrolysis, urea fuel cells and photoelectrochemical urea splitting, are illuminated.

Efficient rapid fractionation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) through evaporative urea inclusion	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												FAMEs work as an alternative to petroleum-based diesel fuels for its low carbon footprint. However, FAMEs' qualities are constrained by the sources' fatty acid profiles. Fractionation of FAMEs can significantly change biodiesel's qualities. Compared to other fractionation methods, evaporative urea inclusion fractionation can rapidly and effectively separate the saturated FAMEs. In addition, FTIR analysis indicated the possible conjugation of host structures by unstable hydrogen bonding and oxygen bonding. Crystallite sizes and strain of urea inclusion compounds (UICs) were calculated from the XRD spectrum, influenced by FAMEs' structures and operation processes. Only the ratios of urea to FAMEs can significantly affect compositions in evaporative urea inclusion fractionation. However, UICs formation rates were influenced by all operation conditions, such as temperatures, pressures, and ratios of urea to FAMEs to solvent. The products were evaluated by the lowtemperature performance, cetane number, oxidation stability, energy density, and emissions. Urea inclusion fractionation can significantly improve the low-temperature performance, the major constraint for enlarging the utilization. However, the decreased cetane number and oxidation stability indicated the possible need for antioxidants and cetane improvers after urea inclusion fractionation. Moreover, the unsaturated enriched products from urea inclusion fractionation can provide the feedstock to synthesize biochemical or biomaterials, such as carboxylic acids, polyesters, and biolubricants.

The as-prepared Ni2P/CFC, as an electrocatalyst, exhibited superior electrocatalytic activities toward urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a potential of 1.42 V (vs. RHE) delivering a current density of 10 mAcm (2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotentials of 90 and 155 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mAcm (2) in alkaline media. On this basis, a Ni2P/CFC constructed two-electrode system for high-efficiency H-2 production and simultaneous urea decomposition was therefore established using commercial urea as reaction source. Besides, such two-electrode system as proof of concept study was also evaluated using human urine as urea source for highly efficient H-2 generation with a rate of 0.35 mu M min (1) at an applied potential of 1.48 V, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm (2).

Many efforts have been made to increase the catalytic activity of Ni-based DUFC anodic catalyst toward urea oxidation, which is considered to be the best non-precious catalyst in alkaline media so far. Alloying Ni with other metals and/or non-metals, and increasing its surface area demonstrated a power of up to 26.9 mW cm(-2) at room temperature, which is comparable to that obtained in direct alcoholic fuel cells using high loading of precious catalyst. However, this is still viewed as low performance. This review presents a comprehensive picture of the mechanism of urea oxidation on Ni-based catalysts, the poisoning effect of catalysts and its possible remedies, as well as the different approaches in preparing highly active catalysts. We also analyze the performance and associated issues of DUFC using newly applied strategies to increase its open-circuit voltage and power output via alternative oxidants and re-designed chemical conditions in the cell.

However, the challenges associated with the intricate designs and mechanisms remain underexplored. Therefore, the present study constructs a p-n junction in a free-standing MnCo2O4.5@Ni3S2 on Ni-Foam. The space-charge region's electrical characteristics is dramatically altered by the formed p-n junction, which enhances the electron transfer process for urea-assisted electrocatalytic water splitting (UOR). The optimal MnCo2O4.5@Ni3S2 electrocatalyst results in greater oxygen evolution reactivity (OER) than pure systems, delivering an overpotential of only 240 mV. Remarkably, upon employing as UOR electrode the required potential decreases to 30 mV. The impressive performance of the designed catalyst is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity, greater number of electrochemical active sites, and improved redox activity due to the junction interface formed between p-MnCo2O4.5 and n-Ni3S2. There are strong indications that the in situ formed extreme-surface NiOOH, starting from Ni3S2, boosts the electrocatalytic activity, i.e., the electrochemical surface reconstruction generates the active species. In conclusion, this work presents a high-performance p-n junction design for broad use, together with a viable and affordable UOR electrocatalyst.

Herein, cobalt vanadate (CVO) nano/microrods electrocatalysts have been successfully synthesized by combining the sol-gel and pyrolysis method for HER and UOR. CVO-500 with the pyrolysis temperature at 500 degrees C shows optimal catalytic activity toward HER and UOR, which just needs overpotentials of 91.4 and 53.6 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), respectively. In addition, it displays surpassing stability for uninterrupted HER and UOR. The CVO-500 catalyst as the anode and cathode for overall urea electrolysis only requires the voltage of 1.51 V to deliver 10 mA/cm(2) with excellent stability in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea solution.

However, the sluggish kinetics and high oxidation potential of NiII -> NiIII severely limit the activity of Ni-based catalysts in the electrochemical UOR. Herein, composition regulation was adopted to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of a nickel-benzene dicarboxylate framework (Ni-BDC MOF)-derived electrode towards urea oxidation. In 1 M KOH with 0.33 M urea solution, the derived amorphous tri-metallic hydroxide layer on the surface of the NiMnCo MOF, induced by electro-activation, exhibited a low onset potential and a steeply rising current density with increasing applied potential. It achieved a benchmark current density of 10/100 mA cm-2 at an anode potential of 1.28/1.33 V vs. RHE, respectively. In particular, a 500 mA cm-2 current density was reached at an impressively low potential of 1.41 V vs. RHE. This exceptional performance is ascribed to the fact that the open framework provides a large electrochemical active surface, while the multicomponent synergy decreases the NiII -> NiIII oxidation potential, enhances electron transfer and promotes the UOR kinetics. This study suggests that rational composition regulation is a promising approach to improving the performance of Ni-based MOF materials towards electrocatalytic urea oxidation. Tri-metallic NiMnCo MOF on nickel foam exhibits superior electrochemical activity for urea oxidation and delivers 500 mA cm-2 current density at a low potential of 1.41 V vs. RHE.

Herein, a hierarchical structure of CuO nanowires decorated with nickel hydroxide supported on 3D Cu foam is constructed. Combined theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the high reactivity and selectivity of CuO and Ni(OH)(2) toward the UOR instead of the oxygen evolution reaction. The hierarchical structure creates a synergistic effect between the two highly active sites, enabling an exceptional UOR activity with a record low potential of 1.334 V (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode) to reach 100 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 14 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH and 0.5 m urea electrolyte. Assembling full urea electrolysis driven by this developed UOR electrocatalyst as the anode and a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst as the cathode provides a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of approximate to 1.36 V with promising operational stability for at least 150 h.

Even though MOF-based catalysts have been broadly investigated in urea electrocatalysis, few MOF catalysts are used for urea photoelectrocatalysis. The latter requires the MOF-based catalysts to efficiently separate and transport the photogenerated holes at the interface of photoanode-electrolyte junctions. In this study, a sulphur-containing organic ligand of 1,4-benzenedithiol (BDT) is innovatively employed to synthesize two-dimensional Ni-BDT MOFs from Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets precursor. After the in-situ electrochemical activation of TiO2@Ni-BDT, the resultant MOF derivative modified TiO2 photoanode named as TiO2@Ni-BDT-A exhibits 3.83 times photocurrent in comparison with the pristine TiO2. A high photovoltage of 0.73 V and an impressive 82 % photocurrent retention after a long-term stability test can also be observed. The improvements are attributed to the enhanced surface active sites and the active species of Ni(2-sigma)+ -SOx, which can efficiently promote charge separation, increase conductivity, improve donor concentration, and lower the charge transfer resistance.

In this work, novel, well-aligned, self-supported NiS/Ni3S4 heteronanorod arrays deposited on graphitized carbonized wood (GCW) are designed (denoted as NiS/Ni3S4/GCW) and synthesized by a facile hydrothermal sulfidation strategy. Benefitting from the optimized surface hydrophilicity/aerophobicity, enhanced electrical conductivity, and 3D hierarchical directional porous architectures, the NiS/Ni3S4/GCW show excellent activity toward the urea oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes. The arrays achieved a low potential of 1.33 V (vs. RHE) and 91 mV (overpotential) at 10 mA cm (2) as well as robust stability for 100 h. Significantly, when employed as anode and cathode simultaneously, the urea electrolyzer constructed by NiS/Ni3S4/GCW catalysts merely requires a low voltage of 1.44 V to drive 10 mA cm (2) with superior stability for 50 h. This work not only demonstrates the application of heterogeneous sulfide for ureaassisted hydrogen production but also provides an effective guideline for using renewable wood for designing efficient catalysts in an economical way.					wu, yi/LZG-1397-2025; liao, yu/AGT-1991-2022; sheng, can/GQP-4313-2022; Xu, Han/JOZ-1851-2023	Xu, Han/0000-0002-3211-7081; Liao, Yu/0000-0002-2004-1884													0021-9797	1095-7103				NOV 15	2022	626						848	857		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.07.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.07.010		JUL 2022						35820219					WOS:000848417100006
J	Du, XQ; Huang, CR; Zhang, XS				Du, Xiaoqiang; Huang, Chenrong; Zhang, Xiaoshuang			Co3O4 arrays with tailored morphology as robust water oxidation and urea splitting catalyst	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												A typical hydrothermal preparation approach was successfully exploited and designed for the in situ growth of highly ordered Co3O4 nanostructure precursors on a Ni foam substrates, a series of Co3O4 nanoarray-based electrocatalysts was obtained via a subsequent calcination procedure. The formation of Co3O4 hierarchical structures with different morphologies depended upon the hydrothermal time, which was used to further reveal the growth mechanism of the Co3O4 nanostructures. H2O and CO(NH2)(2) were selected as probe molecules to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity over the resulting Co-based electrocatalysts, and the influence of the morphology on the electrocatalytic performance was further investigated via employing different hydrothermal times. It is worth noting that Co3O4/NF-11h nanosheets@ nanoneedles heterostructures with a low density of nanosheets presents superior electrocatalytic performance and long-term durability owing to an increased exposure to active sites in the hierarchical nanostructure. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations results show that H2O molecules are preferentially adsorbed at the top of the Co3O4 (111) crystal surface. This work emphasizes the significance of effective structure design for the development of robust and precious metal-free electrocatalysts via the precise control of catalyst morphology.

Herein, Ru nanocrystals were modified on 3D interconnected porous FeOOH nanostructures with open network-like frameworks on NiFe foam (Ru/FeOOH@NFF), which were used as an efficient electrocatalyst. In this study, a 3D interconnected porous FeOOH with an open network structure was first electrodeposited on NiFe foam and served as the support for the in-situ modification of Ru nanocrystals. Subsequently, the Ru nanocrystals and abundant oxygen vacancies were simultaneously incorporated into the FeOOH matrix via the adsorption-reduction method, which involved NaBH4 reduction. The Ru/FeOOH@NFF electrocatalyst shows a large specific surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies, and modulated electronic structure, which collectively result in a significant enhancement of catalytic properties with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The Ru/FeOOH@NFF catalyst exhibits an outstanding OER performance, requiring a low overpotential (360 mV) at 200 mA cm-2 with a small Tafel slope (58 mV dec-1). Meanwhile, the Ru/FeOOH@NFF catalyst demonstrates more efficient UOR activity for achieving 200 mA cm-2 at a lower overpotential of 272 mV. Furthermore, an overall urea electrolysis cell using the Ru/FeOOH@NFF as the anode and Pt as the cathode (Ru/FeOOH@NFF||Pt) reveals a cell voltage of 1.478 V at 10 mA cm-2 and a prominent durability (120 h at 50 mA cm-2). This work will provide a valuable understanding of the construction of high-performance electrocatalysts with 3D microstructure for promoting ureaassisted water electrolysis.

Herein, carbon-doped heterostructured Ni2P (C@Ni2P) nanocomposites are developed via a one-step hydrothermal approach with surface engineering of peapod-assisted nanorods (NRs-peapod) and nanoparticles (NPs). The catalytic activities of the as-prepared hybrids are studied with a robust emphasis on the surface structure-activity relationship. As expected, the embedded carbon matrices improve the electronic configuration of the resultant hybrids. Besides, the collaborative effects of both Ni2P and carbon platforms reduce the electron pathways and further promote the urea electro-oxidation process. In particular, C@Ni2P NRs-peapod present higher activity in terms of the oxidation current density and onset potential compared with C@Ni2P NPs, which is largely assigned to the corresponding high surface area and hence accessible electroactive centers. Moreover, the longitudinal orientation of the NRs-peapod with a preferable porous feature may decrease the charge transfer resistance and facilitate electron/ion diffusion along the electrode surface and at electrode/electrolyte interfaces, indicating their potential for future utilization in direct urea fuel cells.

To realize portable dialysis, a dialysate regeneration system comprising superior adsorbents is required to regenerate the used dialysate. This study aims to develop a nano-adsorbent, derived from corn starch for urea removal. Oxidized starch nano-particles (oxy-SNPs) were prepared via liquid phase oxidation, followed by chemical dissolution and non-solvent precipitation. The oxy-SNPs possessed Z-average size of 177.7 nm with carbonyl and carboxyl contents of 0.068 and 0.048 per 100 glucose units, respectively. The urea adsorption achieved the equilibrium after 4 h with 95% removal. The adsorption mechanism fitted Langmuir isotherm while the adsorption kinetics obeyed pseudo-second-order model. This new material has a maximum adsorption capacity of 185.2 mg/g with a rate constant of 0.04 g/mg.h. Moreover, the oxy-SNPs exhibited the urea uptake recovery of 91.6%.

This work combines experimental and theoretical investigations and characterization techniques confirm the successful formation of the CeO2 embedded on graphene oxide sheets. UOR activity was found to be dependent on both OH- and urea concentrations. The optimal UOR performance was achieved in a 0.1 M urea and 1.0 M KOH solution, as evidenced by the low Tafel slope of 60 mV/dec and high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.690 s(-1). DFT calculations revealed that the CeO2-GO nanocomposite exhibited strong urea adsorption due to its favorable bond lengths (Ce-O: 2.58 & Aring;, O-H: 1.77 & Aring;) and high adsorption energy (-1.05 eV). These findings revealed that the CeO2-GO nanocomposites are promising as efficient and durable electrocatalysts for urea conversion to valuable products like nitrogen and hydrogen gas, with potential applications in clean energy generation and ammonia synthesis.

However, they have their own drawbacks, like the oxidation of Fe(II)EDTA and the low solubility of NO in urea solution. To overcome these defects, A mixed absorbent containing both (NH2)(2)CO and Fe(II)EDTA was employed. The effects of various operating parameters (urea and Fe(II)EDTA concentration, temperature, inlet oxygen concentration, pH value) on NO removal were examined in the packed tower. The results indicated that the NO removal efficiency increased with the decrease of oxygen concentration as well as the increase of Fe(II)EDTA concentration. The NO removal efficiency had little change with a range of 25 45 degrees C, and sharply decreased at the temperature of above 55 degrees C. The NO removal efficiency initially increases up to the maximum value and then decreases with the increase of pH value as well as the raise of urea concentration. In addition, the synergistic mechanism of (NH2)(2)CO and Fe(II)EDTA on NO removal was investigated. Results showed that urea could react with Fe EDTA-NO to produce Fe(II)EDTA, N-2, and CO2, and hinder oxidation of Fe(II)EDTA. Finally, to evaluate the effect of SO32- on NO removal, a mixed absorbent containing Fe(II)EDTA, urea, and Na2SO3 was employed to absorb NO. The mixed absorbent could maintain more than 78% for 80 min at 25 degrees C, pH = 7.0, (NH2)(2)CO concentration of 5 wt%, Fe(II)EDTA concentration of 0.02 M, O-2 concentration of 7% (v/v), and Na2SO3 concentration of 0.2 M.

G.			Real direct urea fuel Fell operation using standalone Ni-based metal-organic framework prepared by ball mill at room temperature	ENERGY												Climate change and health issues are exacerbated by fossil fuel use. Efficient environmental energy conversion devices can reduce these effects. For the first time, we used a simple ball milling approach to manufacture a Nickel-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) at ambient temperature directly onto a carbon cloth surface (Ni-MOF/CC) for a direct urea fuel cell (DUFC) anode. The prepared materials' crystaline structure, surface topography, and elemental content were studied using X-Ray diffraction and a scanning electron microscope with an EDS analyzer. Cyclic voltammetry, impedance electrochemical spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry were used in a three-electrode cell configuration to evaluate the material's electrochemical oxidation efficiency, particularly toward urea. In-Situ, under real fuel cell operation circumstances, we tested the electrodes in a twoelectrode cell configuration. The Ni-MOF/CC exhibited a 0.35 V onset potential owed to Ni(OH)2 (Ni+2)/Ni+3 NiOOH active site. The electrode was stable for urea oxidation and operated well under real fuel cell conditions, producing 5 mW/cm2 using 1 M urea. The Ni-based MOF's fast charge and mass transfer capabilities, which was directly synthesized onto the carbon cloth surface, make the produced electrode operate well compared with bare carbon cloth. The results of the current work allow for more efficient environmental energy conversion devices that will reduce global warming.

Herein, synergistic interactions in Ni/Co mixed oxides/hydroxides enhanced the UOR with low onset potential, fast reaction kinetics, and good selectivity against the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations signified the collaborative interaction of Ni/Co mixed oxide/hydroxide heterostructures to enhance UOR activity. Our results showed that Ni3+ species, formed at high anodic potential, produced a high anodic current primarily from unwanted OER. Instead, the Ni/Co heterostructures with dominant Ni2+ and Co3+ species remained stable at low anodic potential and exhibited anodic current exclusively attributed to UOR. This work highlights the importance of tuning valence charges for designing high-performance and selective UOR electrocatalysts to benefit the environmental remediation of urea runoff and enable urea electrolysis for hydrogen production by replacing conventional OER with UOR at the anode.

In order to further improve the energy conversion efficiency of ZABs, a novel urea-assisted ZAB system was proposed by replacing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower theoretical thermodynamic potential. Inspired by nature's ingenious structure-function, a "leaf-branch" CoNi@NCNTs-LDH/CC binary-site electrocatalyst was designed for the above system, where spatially separated branches and leaves serve as the main active sites for ORR and UOR, respectively. A build-in electric field from CoNi-LDH to CoNi@NCNTs is formed at the interface of the composite, which plays a command effect, effectively triggering the accumulation of O-2 and urea reactants around the CoNi and LDH sites, respectively, and thus improving the efficiency of both ORR and UOR reactions. Based on that, a conceptual urea-assisted rechargeable ZAB is demonstrated to have significantly decreased charging voltage, higher energy conversion efficiency (74.6 %) compared with the conventional ZAB, as well as high urea elimination rates. Considering the urea-assisted ZAB with high energy conversion efficiency and wastewater treatment versatility as an energy transfer station applied in a high value-added agricultural system, uninterrupted hydrogen production and wastewater treatment of agricultural wastewater can be simultaneously achieved using sustainable energy sources.

Ultrasonic-assisted synthesis of nickel metal-organic framework for efficient urea removal and water splitting applications	SYNTHETIC METALS												The change in the climate is considered a critical environmental issue that humanity will deal with through the next decade. Herein, the ultrasonic-assisted method prepared the metal-organic framework for several envi-ronmental applications. The Ni-MOF was used as an efficient electrocatalyst for electrochemical urea removal. The prepared materials were characterized by analytical techniques like powder infrared spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis. Several electro-chemical techniques were used to study the activity of Ni-MOF toward urea removals, like cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The activity of the modified GC/Ni-MOF electrode toward urea oxidation was expressed as a function of current density. Thus, the current density value reached 64 mA cm-2 at a potential of 0.41 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Many kinetic parameters were studied, like diffusion coefficient (D), surface coverage (Gamma), Tafel slope, and charge transfer coefficient (alpha). Else, the activity of the electrode was investigated toward water splitting. The oxygen evolution was studied in an alkaline medium. Accordingly, the electrode recorded 50 mA cm-2 at the potential of 0.76 and 0.85 V (vs. Ag/ AgCl) for GC/Ni-MOF and GC/NiO, respectively.

Nickel-Cobalt Modified Boron-Doped Diamond as an Electrode for a Urea/H2O2 Fuel Cell	BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN												A nickel-cobalt-modified boron-doped diamond (NiCo-BDD) electrode was prepared by chronoamperometry. A Ni/Co ratio of 4:1 in solution was determined as the optimum ratio for the urea oxidation reaction. Results showed that the Ni and Co particles were homogeneously deposited on the BDD surface and deposited without any interaction between the particles. The prepared NiCo-BDD electrode for a urea fuel cell exhibited optimum performance with a 0.1M KOH and 0.50M urea solution as the anode electrolyte and a 2.0M H2O2 and 2.0M H2SO4 solution as the cathode electrolyte. An open-circuit voltage of 0.817V with a power density of approximately 0.632mW cm(-2) at room temperature and excellent stability after 6 h of application were achieved. NiCo-BDD significantly enhanced the catalytic activity of UOR compared with the Ni plate, unmodified BDD, Ni-BDD, and Co-BDD.

The synthesis process yields highly uniform close-packed superlattices with a dominant c-axis orientation. The self-assembled c-oriented Ni(OH)2 films exhibit advantageous electrocatalytic performance in urea oxidation, presenting significantly lower overpotentials and higher current densities compared to randomly distributed Ni(OH)(2) particles. In-depth in situ impedance analysis and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate that the c-oriented Ni(OH)(2) films possess a higher propensity for a Ni valence transition from +2 to +3 during the urea oxidation process. This finding provides crucial insights into the catalytic behavior and electronic transformations of c-oriented Ni(OH)(2) films, shedding light on their superior electrocatalytic activity for urea oxidation. Overall, this study advances our understanding of urea electrooxidation mechanisms and contributes to the design of efficient urea electrocatalysts.

Herein, for the first time, we report a unique and universal room-temperature urea plasma method for controllable synthesis of N-doped carbon coated metal (Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) nitrides arrays electrocatalysts. The preformed metal oxides arrays can be successfully converted into metal nitrides arrays with preserved nanostructures and a thin layer of N-doped carbon (NC) via one-step urea plasma. Typically, as a representative case, NC@CoN nanowire arrays are illustrated and corresponding formation mechanism by plasma is proposed. Notably, the designed NC@CoN catalysts deliver excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability both in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). For OER, a low overpotential (264 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) and high stability (>50 h at 20 mA/cm(2)) are acquired. For UOR, a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) is achieved at only 1.39 V and maintain over 100 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that the synergetic coupling effect of CoN and NC can significantly facilitate the charge-transfer process, optimize adsorbed intermediates binding strength and further greatly decrease the energy barrier. This strategy provides a novel method for fabrication of NC@ metal nitrides as highly active and stable catalysts.

Herein, we design a novel flow reactor integrated with three-dimensional hierarchically porous Ru/RuO2 architectures anchored on a Ti mesh. The hierarchically macroporous electrode can create sufficient exposure of catalytically active sites and facilitate the microscopic mass transport and diffusion inside the active layer, thereby contributing to the increased removal efficiency of urea-N and ammonia-N. The combined results of electrochemical measurements, UV-visible spectrometry and in situ Raman spectrometry, show that the OCl- species produced by chlorine evolution reaction (CER) are the main active constituents for removing urea-N. Theoretical calculations reveal thLTWAat the Ru/RuO2 possesses a moderate Cl binding strength, lower theo-retical overpotentials of CER and a higher conductivity, compared with pure RuO2. On this basis, we assemble a circular flow reactor with the hierarchically porous electrodes in a two-electrode system to obtain an enhanced microfluidic process, which during 9 days of uninterrupted operation, at a high electrolysis current of 500 mA, achieve a total nitrogen removal of 92.6% and an energy consumption of 7.94 kWh kg(-1) N, demonstrating the promising application of the novel process.

An inexpensive Ni-doped Co3O4 electrocatalyst for urea oxidation	COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS												Ni-doped Co3O4 catalysts with various Ni concentrations (0.01, and 0.015 M) were synthesized using a simple, cost-effective hydrothermal route. The synthesized samples are denoted as Co3O4-1 and Co3O4-2. Structural and morphological properties of as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, XPS, SEM, and HR-TEM techniques. The electrochemical characteristics for the urea oxidation (UOR) on Ni-doped Co3O4 catalyst were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry (CA). The Ni-doped Co3O4 with the lower Ni percentage (Co3O4-1) exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity toward the UOR than Co3O4-2. Co3O4-1 had a high surface area and pore size, which influence the UOR. Co3O4-1 showed high stability up to 10,000 s. Overall, Co(3)O4(-)1 has significant potential in energy consumption and wastewater treatment.

The inhibition effects and mechanisms of LTU and other traditional inhibitors (NaHCO3 and VC) on coal sample oxidation were compared and analyzed using a C600 high-precision calorimeter, a temperature-programmed oxidation device and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The experimental results showed that LTU had an obvious synergistic effect on the inhibition of coal spontaneous combustion (CSC): 1) LTU could increase the initial exothermic temperature point, prolong the endothermic stage, and reduce the exothermic intensity of coal-oxygen reaction; 2) The coal sample treated with LTU showed a significant decrease in the concentration of carbon oxygen and alkane gases released, and an increase in the gas production temperature point, which was better than the inhibition effect of NaHCO3 and VC under the same conditions. 3) The physical components of LTU could encapsulate the coal, insulate the oxygen, absorb heat and decrease the temperature; moreover, its chemical components could consume (-OH), (RO-), (ROO-) in the chain reaction, inert the free radicals in the chain reaction, inhibit oxidization and block CSC. This study provides an efficient and economical chemical inhibitor for safe production in the coal industry and important theoretical support for a deeper understanding of the CSC inhibition mechanism.

A CeO2 functional metal oxide was used to modify a spinel oxide in order to further improve the electrocatalytic performance of the spinel oxide. In this work, a CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF hybrid nanostructure was synthesized for the first time by typical hydrothermal and calcination methods. In an alkaline medium, CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF displays superior OER activity and needs an overpotential of 213 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), which makes it one of the most active catalysts reported so far. In addition, the as-prepared CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF material needs a potential of 1.40 V at the same current density in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, which displays superior UOR activity. The CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF catalyst also displays good durability and the performance of the electrode is negligibly attenuated at a large current intensity of 125 mA cm(-2). Experimental results demonstrate that the activity of the CeO2@CoFe2O4/NF catalyst is ascribed to the exposure of more active centers and a faster electron transfer rate. This work develops a novel method for exploiting Earth-abundant, robust and environmentally friendly OER and UOR electrocatalysts.																			1477-9226	1477-9234				SEP 21	2021	50	35					12301	12307		10.1039/d1dt01952j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1dt01952j		JUL 2021						34519756					WOS:000686618700001

Boosting hydrogen production in ultrathin birnessite nanosheet arrays-based electrolytic cell by glycerol and urea oxidation reactions	MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY												It is still a big challenge to develop an innovative strategy to overcome sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, ultrathin birnessite@nickel foam nanosheet array (KMO@NF) with oxygen vacancy (VO) is prepared by an in-situ growth method. KMO@NF shows a high activity for water splitting because VO and Mn3+ favor the adsorption of OH- and H2O. Furthermore, glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are employed to substitute for OER to improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Compared with OER, the anodic current densities of GOR and UOR have increased by 19.34 and 18.04 times at 1.43 V (vs. reverse hydrogen electrode (RHE)), respectively. To reach the same current density of 30 mA/cm2, the required cell voltages for UOR- and GOR-based electrolytic cells have decreased by about 16% than that of water-based electrolytic cell (2.024 V), meaning that to produce the same amount of hydrogen, about 16% of electric energy can be economized. Besides, the Faradaic efficiencies of UOR- and GOR-based electrolytic cells (95% and 97%) are higher than that of water-based electrolytic cell (92%), confirming a higher conversion of energy. The innovative system can not only produce hydrogen efficiently, but also effectively degrade environmental pollutants. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the high active state of Ni3+ formation induced by Mo6+ and their efficient synergism in NiS2-MoS2 hetero-nanorods powder catalyst with the rough layered structure are demonstrated, as proof of concept, for the urea-assisted water electrolysis. This catalyst can be derived from the sulfidation of NiMoO4 nanorods that can realize individual metal sulfides sufficiently mixing at a domain size in the nanoscale which creates lots of active sites and nanointerfaces. The high valence state of Mo6+ and Ni3+ formation and increased conductive phase of 1 T MoS2 in the hetero-nanorods compared to the counterpart pure phases are revealed by spectral study and microscopic analysis; high electrochemical surface area and active site exposure are found due to the nano-interface formation and layered rough nanosheets over the surface of nanorods. They show much higher catalytic performance than their pure phases for urea oxidation, including high catalytic activity, stability, charge transfer ability and catalytic kinetics resulting from more active Ni3+ species formation and electronic synergism of high valence metals. Transformation of 1 T MoS2 to Mo6+ and increased amount of Mo6+ and Ni3+ after stability test indicate their involvement and synergism for the catalysis reaction. The current work offers a novel understanding of the synergistic effect based on the high valence state synergism for heterogeneous catalysts in electrocatalysis.

In this study, FeCoNiCrMn, FeCoNiCrMnO, and FeCoNiCrMnC high entropy alloy thin films were prepared by magnetron sputtering by controlling the sputtering power, varying the sputtering atmosphere, and using double target co-sputtering, respectively. The microstructure and surface morphology of the electrode were observed and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and atomic force microscope. In addition, the chemical state of the elements on the electrode surface was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to clarify the mechanism related to the excellent UOR performance of the electrode. The study found that a small amount of carbon doping can greatly improve the UOR performance of this type of electrode. The amorphous FeCoNiCrMnC electrode has more potential UOR active sites than the facecentered cubic FeCoNiCrMn electrode. After cyclic voltammetry (CV), the potential active sites of the electrode are activated, and the active substances of these electrodes are increased, furthermore, the UOR performance of these electrodes has improved. Since it has 200 cycles of CV, the 10 mA cm(-2) potential of FeCoNiCrMnC electrode for UOR is only 1.337 V. After 100 days of natural aging, the catalytic ability of the electrode not only did not decrease but slightly improved, with a potential of 1.321 V at 10 mA cm(-2), reflecting the good stability of the catalytic electrode.

Herein, a novel V-doping defective NiFe-layered double hydroxides nanosheets (D-NiFeV-LDHs) was constructed via a hydrothermal and alkali-etching strategy as an efficient electrocatalyst. Through effectively manipulating the local coordination environments of catalytical active sites from high valance V-doping and offering more active sites from incorporating the Fe3+ cation-vacancy defects, the D-NiFeV-LDHs achieves an extraordinarily low overpotential of 196 mV and a potential of 1.34 V at 10 mA cm-2 for OER and UOR, respectively, surpassing the commercial RuO2 catalyst. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation outcomes unveil that the absorption and desorption energy are balanced by the optimized d-band center, and thus the barrier of Gibbs free energy is significantly reduced favorable for enhancing the catalytic reactions.

Herein, dual-phased nickel-based cost-effective catalyst nickel phosphide (Ni2P)-nickel metaphosphate (Ni2P4O12) microspheric nanoparticles were fabricated through a two-step hydrothermal-phosphorization process by preciously controlling the feeding ratios of the Ni precursor and the P source.

Uncovering the Change in Catalytic Activity during Electro-oxidation of Urea: Answering Overisolation of the Relaxation Phenomenon	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C												Electro-oxidation of urea offers tremendous opportunity for the economical hydrogen production option owing to its lower thermodynamic potential barriers. Slower reaction rate and multiple gas desorption steps hinder the implementation of urea-based fuel cells, and thus understanding the urea oxidation process is key for the commercialization of this technology. In this report, we systematically examined the electrocatalytic urea oxidation activity of nickel-based model catalysts such as Ni12P5 and Ni(OH)(2) in an alkaline medium at a fixed urea concentration of 0.33 M using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Ni12P5 and Ni(OH)(2) require potentials of 0.51 and 0.54 V vs Hg/ HgO, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The origin of the catalytic activity difference of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) between these two Ni catalysts is briefly analyzed using nondestructive in situ EIS. We measured the electrochemical impedance spectra of both the catalysts at their faradic potentials, and the obtained Nyquist plots suggest that the depressed arcs possess more than one time constant. We used the impedance spectroscopy genetic programing (ISGP) method to obtain the distribution function of relaxation times (DFRTs). DFRTs show the existence of three relaxation processes that occur during the anodic UOR, which are the effect of pores or active material (P1), charge transfer resistance related to oxidation of Ni (P2), and charge transfer resistance associated with oxidation of urea (P3). The location of P2 and P3 at higher frequencies for Ni12P5 compared to its counterpart Ni(OH)(2) confirms that Ni12P5 can be a better catalyst.

To overcome this problem, self-supported fluorine-modified 2D ultrathin nickel hydroxide (F-Ni(OH)(2)) nanosheets (NSs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are prepared with a scalable and ascendant one-step synthesis route. The enhanced redox activity, electrical conductivity and a great number of exposed active sites of the heterogeneous catalysts improve charge migration for the electrocatalytic reactions. The density of states of the d orbitals of the Ni atoms significantly increases near the Fermi level, thereby indicating that the Ni atoms near the F-dopants promote electrical conduction in the Ni(OH)(2) monolayer. The F-Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalyst exhibits notable OER and UOR activity with onset potentials of 1.43 and 1.16 V versus RHE, respectively required to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which are comparable to those of commercial noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. With RuCo-OH nanospheres, the settled F-Ni(OH)(2)||RuCo-OH cell requires merely 1.55 and 1.37 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with superb durability for 24 h in overall water and urea electrolysis, respectively. Overall, high-quality, and efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for overall water and urea electrolysis can be prepared with a simple, scalable, and reproducible preparation method.

However, their electrode reactions including oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) all suffer from sluggish kinetics, which urgently need catalysts to accelerate the processes. Herein, we design and prepare an OER/UOR/HER trifunctional catalyst by transforming the homemade CoO nanorod into a two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin heterojunction nickel-iron-cobalt hybrid phosphides nanosheet (NiFeP/CoP) via a hydrothermalphosphorization method. Consequently, a strong electronic interaction was found among the Ni2P/FeP4/CoP heterogeneous interfaces, which regulates the electronic structure. Besides the high mass transfer property of 2D nanosheet, Ni2P/FeP4/CoP displays improved OER/UOR/HER performance. At 10 mA cm-2, the OER overpotential reaches 274 mV in 1.0 M KOH, and the potential of UOR is only 1.389 V in 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea. More strikingly, the two-electrode systems for electrolysis water and urea-assisted electrolysis water assembled by NiFeP/CoP could maintain long-term stability for 35 h and 12 h, respectively. This work may help to pave the way for upcoming research horizons of multifunctional electrocatalysts.

The modification of the surface of Bi2WO6 at acidic pH implied an acetal-type interaction with the aldehyde, and then the separation of the solid at neutral pH guaranteed the irreversible covalent functionalization. Langmuir isotherm measurements and infrared spectroscopy support the surface modification. Studies based on stationary and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy showed the effect on the dynamics (lifetime) of charge carrier deactivation due to surface modification. A higher rate of formation of the hydroxyl radical using Bi2WO6-4SCA as compared to Bi2WO6 was measured. The photocatalytic tests carried out in a tubular bench reactor (TBR) showed improvements of the modified Bi2WO6 in the mineralization of urea. In addition, the latter process became faster as the initial urea concentration was decreased. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic parameters for urea oxidation were measured and discussed. These findings are important to understand the deactivation dynamics of excited electrons at the semiconductor-electrolyte interphase and to optimize the conditions necessary to carry out an efficient photoredox reaction (e.g., degradation of an important pollutant such as urea).

Physicochemical and electrochemical investigations of an electrodeposited CeNi2@NiO nanomaterial as a novel anode electrocatalyst material for urea oxidation in alkaline media	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS												Energy and water treatment can be considered to be major challenges in socioeconomic growth. The urea fuel cell (UFC) is a system that uses urea-containing waste water to generate power; this system satisfies two aims: treating water that contains urea and providing electricity from waste water. In this work, an electrodeposited material, CeNi2@NiO, was introduced to enhance the anodic behavior of UFC. The as-fabricated CeNi2@NiO nanoparticles (NPs) were studied using field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), Energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. These analyses indicated that the presented NPs possessed CeNi2@NiO NPs that have a low CeNi2 content and have NiO as their primary form. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted in a 3-electrode system to investigate the performance of CeNi2@NiO for urea electrooxidation and/or as an anode material for UFC. The synthesized NPs showed an improved electrocatalytic behavior at high pH (KOH media) in different urea concentrations, up to 1.0 mol/l. The superior electroactivity can be attributed to the assembly of Ce with Ni during the electrodeposition step, which enhances roughness, charge transfer and structural defects of Ni sites.

Encapsulating urea granules with hydrophobic material can be one solution. Additionally, the inverse vulcanized copolymer obtained from vegetable oils are a new class of green sulfur-enriched polymer with good biodegradation and better sulfur oxidation potential, but they possess unreacted sulfur, which leads to void generations. In this study, inverse vulcanization reaction conditions to minimize the amount of unreacted sulfur through response surface methodology (RSM) is optimized. The copolymer obtained was then characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FTIR confirmed the formation of the copolymer, TGA demonstrated that copolymer is thermally stable up to 200 & DEG;C temperature, and DSC revealed the sulfur conversion of 82.2% (predicted conversion of 82.37%), which shows the goodness of the model developed to predict the sulfur conversion. To further maximize the sulfur conversion, 5 wt% diisopropenyl benzene (DIB) as a crosslinker is added during synthesis to produce terpolymer. The urea granule is then coated using terpolymer, and the nutrient release longevity of the coated urea is tested in distilled water, which revealed that only 65% of its total nutrient is released after 40 days of incubation. The soil burial of the terpolymer demonstrated its biodegradability, as 26% weight loss happens in 52 days of incubation. Thus, inverse vulcanized terpolymer as a coating material for urea demonstrated far better nutrient release longevity compared with other biopolymers with improved biodegradation; moreover, these copolymers also have potential to improve sulfur oxidation.

Atomically dispersed metal atoms in two-dimensional materials have shown promising performance in various electrocatalytic reactions. However, the potential for UOR and the effect of anchoring type on their activity have not been fully explored. Herein, we designed two types of Ni atom-anchoring C2N electrocatalysts: doping (Ni-C2N) and adsorbing (Ni/C2N), and compared their UOR activities by density functional theory calculations. The investigation of the structural and electronic properties revealed the origin of the activity difference of both models. Consequently, Ni/C2N doped with Ni-N coordination bonds exhibited higher catalytic activity than that of the adsorbing sample due to its higher conductivity, favorable Ni-N coordination structure, and charge transfer with N-H-containing intermediates, hence enhancing the adsorption and dehydrogenation of key intermediates. Moreover, we demonstrated that the UOR activity can be further improved by introducing a second Ni atom to a hole in C2N. This study offers a valuable theoretical understanding of the design of atomically dispersed catalysts for efficient UOR.

Replacing sluggish OER with thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation reaction holds great promise for energy-efficient H2 generation while also addressing the issue of urea-rich water contamination. In this paper, novel hollow nanorod arrays made of NiCoP nanosheets (denoted as NiCoP NSs@HNRAs) are created using an environmentally friendly and simple template-assisted electrodeposition and subsequent phosphorization method. The distinct HNRAs enable fast transport and short diffusion paths for electroactive species, as well as the high catalysts availability. Because of these structural advantages, NiCoP NSs@HNRAs have excellent electrocatalyst activity, requiring only a potential of 1.35 V (vs. RHE) to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with robust durability. Furthermore, an overall urea electrolysis system is constructed using commercial Pt/C as the cathode and NiCoP NSs@HNRAs as the anode, with an outstanding activity of 1.43 V and excellent stability at 50 mA cm-2.

However, the design of a robust catalyst for ureaassisted H2 generation remains a difficult problem. In this study, an innovative strategy to integrate bimetallic spinel sulfides CoNi2S4 nanosheet arrays with graphitized carbonized wood (denoted as CoNi2S4/GCW) for synergistically optimizing the electroconductivity and the hierarchical porous structure of the CoNi2S4/GCW catalyst is proposed. Benefitting from the optimized three-dimensional (3D) porous structure and the CoNi2S4 nanosheet arrays, the CoNi2S4/GCW catalyst exhibit brightly electrocatalytic performance toward both for UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The synthesized CoNi2S4/GCW needs an ultralow potential (1.29 V vs. RHE) for UOR and a comparative small overpotential (119 mV) for HER at a current density of 20 mA cm-2, respectively, enabling a two-electrode configuration at a cell voltage of 1.42 V to output 20 mA cm-2 for ureaassisted electrocatalytic H2 generation. The enhanced urea-assisted performance of CoNi2S4/GCW is supposed to arise from a synergistic effect between the CoNi2S4 nanosheets and the 3D hierarchical porous wood framework, which offers sufficient active sites and expedite the mass transfer process between them.

However, how to tune the heterogeneous interface state and density in heterostructures to optimize their electrocatalytic performance is still a challenge. Here, we propose a method for the preparation of NiS-NiS2 heterostructure by vulcanization of nickel foam at high temperature, which can effectively tune the weight ratio of NiS to NiS2 in heterostructure and their corresponding electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overall urea splitting performance. The electrocatalytic activity show a trend of volcano curve with the increase of the ratio of NiS to NiS2, and the best electrocatalytic activity was obtained at the ratio of 6.74, in which the potentials at current density of 10 mA cm-2 of UOR, HER and overall urea splitting are 1.28 V, -49.5 mV and 1.34 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), and the Tafel slopes are 21.7, 74.1 and 90.9 mV dec-1, respectively.

Here the Ni-Co-P flower-like nanostructure coated on reduced graphene oxide which was synthesized via two-step electrodeposition method (as Ni-Co-P/rGO/NF) is described. First, rGO was deposited on the nickel foam precursor by the pulse-reverse electrodeposition, then Ni-Co-P nano-layer by the Chronoamperometry was electrodeposited. The & eta;10 for HER and UOR was 53 mV and 1.23 V, respec-tively, demonstrate enhanced electrocatalytic activity. XRD, XPS, and TEM analysis revealed that the Ni-Co-P/rGO catalyst has a flower-like structure depending on its composition. In the two-electrode cell at a voltage of 1.35 V, the generated current density of urea electrolysis (37.84 mA cm-2 in 0.33 M urea + 1.0 M KOH electrolyte) was 3.31 times greater than that of the conventional water splitting (11.41 mA cm-2). According to the findings, Ni-Co-P/rGO could be employed as a dual-functional catalyst toward UOR and HER for energy-saving and H2 generation.

Studies have shown that p-n heterojunctions can effectively regulate the electronic structure of catalytic active sites while having abundant surface/interface structure, which plays an important role in improving the native catalytic activity. Herein, FeNi-OH/Co(OH)2/NF p-n heterojunction structure was constructed by a simple electrochemical deposition method, and the effects of content, deposition time, and number of cycles on catalytic performance were investigated. The results show that Fe(0.02 M)Ni(0.07 M)-OH(100 s)/Co (OH)2(5)/NF composite material has the best OER and UOR catalytic performance. For OER, the electrocatalyst only requires an overpotential of 271 mV to obtain a current density of 50 mA cm-2, and an applied voltage of 1.56 V to obtain a total water decomposition of 10 mA cm-2 (FeNi-OH/Co(OH)2/NF||Pt). For UOR, a voltage of only 1.314 V (vs. RHE) is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2, and an applied voltage of 1.44 V can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Experimental, in situ measurements and theoretical results indicate that the improvement in catalytic activity is mainly due to the potential difference between FeNi-OH and Co (OH)2, which induces self-driven charge transfer at the interface, promoting the adsorption of reactant molecules, optimizing reaction barriers, accelerating chemical bond cleavage, and thus promoting catalytic reactions.

A three-dimensional (3D) nickel-containing metal-organic framework {[Ni-2(II)(pdaa)(OH)(2)(H2O)](n) (MOF 1) (where, H(2)pdaa = 1,4-phenylene diacetic acid) was investigated as a robust and highly efficient electrocatalyst for the UOR. MOF 1 comprised 1D nickel(ii) chains crosslinked through Ni4O4 cubane units to form a 3D extended network. Dangling NiMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISOH- groups were exposed in the MOF 1 structure, and could act as active catalytic centers for the UOR. MOF 1 required a very small onset potential of 1.18 V for urea oxidation in KOH (1 M) and urea (0.33 M) and had a low Tafel slope of 38.8 mV dec(-1) (in contrast to 1.84 V for the oxygen evolution reaction). The overpotential required to attain a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was 1.24 V, which is much lower than that for many materials. Controlled potential electrolysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy affirmed the physicochemical integrity of the catalyst over a 17 h test reaction. This work not only addresses the problem of urea contamination, it also helps to utilize it in an energy-conversion process.

Herein, the nitrogen-doped carbon-decorated tricomponent metal phosphides of FeP4 nanotube@Ni-Co-P nanocage (NC-FNCP) with unique nested hollow architectures are fabricated by a self-sacrifice template strategy. Benefiting from the multi-component synergy, the modification of nitrogen-doped carbon, and the modulation of nested porous hollow morphology, NC-FNCP facilitates rapid electron/mass transport in water and urea electrolysis. NC-FNCP-based anode shows low potentials of 248 mV and 1.37 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) to attain 10 mA/cm(2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. In addition, the overall urea electrolysis drives 10 mA/cm(2) at a comparatively low voltage of 1.52 V (vs. RHE) that is 110 mV lower than that of overall water electrolysis, as well as exhibits excellent stability over 20 h.

Here, a layered triple hydroxide (BiCoAl-LTH) was grown in situ on nickel foam (NF) to prepare a self-supported electrode. The BiCoAl-LTH/NF electrode exhibits a unique two-dimensional array structure. Since Al is easily etched in a strong alkaline solution, a large number of oxygen vacancies are generated, which is conducive to improving the conductivity of BiCoAl-LTH/NF catalyst and thereby enhancing its urea oxygen reaction (UOR) activity. The BiCoAl-LTH/NF can achieve a current density of 100 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 198 mV in UOR process. The BiCoAl-LTH/NF was used as both the anode and cathode to construct a urea electrolysis system. A current density of 100 mA/cm2 can be achieved with only a cell voltage of 1.65 V. Compared to conventional water electrolysis with the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode, the BiCoAl-LTH/NF catalyst can save 40% of energy in urea electrolysis for hydrogen production.					yu, xueping/M-9687-2013	Peng, Juan/0000-0003-0008-4593													1432-8488	1433-0768				SEP	2024	28	9					3391	3402		10.1007/s10008-024-05926-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10008-024-05926-2		MAY 2024											WOS:001220304200001

A TiO2 nanorod and perylene diimide based inorganic/organic nanoheterostructure photoanode for photoelectrochemical urea oxidation	NANOSCALE ADVANCES												Visible light-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) urea oxidation using inorganic/organic nano-heterostructure (NH) photoanodes is an attractive method for hydrogen (H-2) production. In this article, inorganic/organic NHs (TiO2/PDIEH) consisting of a N,N-bis(2-ethylhexyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDIEH) thin layer over TiO2 nanorods (NRs) were fabricated for the PEC urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In these NHs, a PDIEH layer was anchored on TiO2 NR arrays using the spin-coating technique, which is beneficial for the uniform deposition of PDIEH on TiO2 NRs. Uniform deposition facilitated adequate interface contact between PDIEH and TiO2 NRs. TiO2/PDIEH NHs achieved a high current density of 1.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.96 V-RHE compared to TiO2 NRs. TiO2/PDIEH offers long-term stability under light illumination with 90.21% faradaic efficiency. TiO2/PDIEH exhibits a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 0.52%.

Impressively, the maximum current density of the prepared amorphous NiWO4 is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of the crystalline counterpart. The su-perior activity is attributed to not only the enrichment of electrochemically active sites, but also the more suitable binding energies toward urea reactant and CO2 product on the amorphous NiWO4 as revealed by in situ infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

To address this, we proposed a simple and efficient method for synthesizing platinum-nickel alloyed nanoparticles (PtNi NPs) using a one-pot solvothermal approach using glucose as the reducing agent for urea determination. Experimental results demonstrated that PtNi NPs exhibit abundant active sites that facilitate urea electrooxidation (UEO). Taking advantage of this, we developed a novel enzymatic-free PtNi NPs modified screen-printed electrode for electrochemical urea sensing. Then, the electrochemical performance of the as-fabricated sensor is evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements. The sensor demonstrates a wider linear range of 0.1 mu M-10 mM and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.015 mu M (S/N = 3). The excellent performance allows for the sensor's application in diluted tap water with satisfactory outcomes.

Here, from the perspective of electronic structure and metal redox capability, we explored the composition dependence of urchin-like NixCo3-xO4 (x = 0, 0.75, 0.86, 1, and 1.20) spinel in UOR to investigate the role of octahedral nickel atoms in the spinel structure. The results indicated that the UOR activity could be promoted by embedding more Ni ions into the octahedral sites, allowing the accumulation of a large number of nickel redox equivalents and an increase in the level of the low-spin state of Ni3+. Furthermore, a near-unity occupancy of the eg orbital of Ni ions could enhance the intrinsic UOR activity of spinel catalysts. Urea oxidation proceeds through the electrochemical oxidation mechanism and direct urea electro-oxidation reaction pathway, where NiOOH species act as active sites in catalyzing the process. This work offers a guideline for designing and synthesizing non-precious metal-coupled Ni-based catalysts with appropriate redox properties for urea oxidation applications.

This work presents the enhanced electrochemical hydrogen generation process from urea sewage by coupling the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under the catalysis of nanoporous nickel-iron (NP-NiFe)-based catalysts. The porous structure at the nanoscale facilitates electrocatalysis through exposure and access more active sites as well as improving the mass transfer. The optimized NP-NiFe (NP-Ni0.7Fe0.3) displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The overpotential can be further lowered to similar to 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in urea sewage (0.33 M urea and 1 M KOH) because of coupling with the UOR, and therefore, the full water splitting potential is much lower in urea sewage (1.55 vs 1.68 V) at 10 mA cm(-2). The relationship between the UOR and OER at different potentials during electrolysis of urea was further investigated by mass spectrometry. The spontaneous desorption of CO2 (UOR product) from the surface of NP-NiFe indicates that NP-NiFe has more effective UOR activity. In addition, NP-NiFe has also been proven to be used in the full electrolysis of urea-containing wastewater for hydrogen production.					; DENG, Qibo/H-8471-2013; zhang, wei/I-9335-2016; zhao, yunfeng/H-1380-2011	Cao, Zhen/0000-0003-3369-5526; DENG, Qibo/0000-0003-3383-9358; zhang, wei/0000-0002-8340-0821; MA, XIAO-RONG/0009-0004-2813-8236; zhao, yunfeng/0000-0002-1442-992X													2168-0485					JUL 27	2020	8	29					11007	11015		10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c04049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c04049													WOS:000557382400042

In this paper, nitrogen doped carbon coated NiMoOx rod array (NiMoOx@NC) is successfully synthesized on nickel foam (NF). The nitrogen-doped carbon layer protects the unique rod array structure of the catalyst, making it exhibit both superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity underwater. This facilitates the full diffusion of the electrolyte on the catalyst surface and the rapid departure of the hydrogen bubbles from the catalyst surface. Consequently, NiMoOx@NC demonstrates an electrocatalytic performance of 1.380 V (vs RHE) at 25 mA cm(-2) for UOR and an overpotential of 126 mV at 25 mA cm(-2) for HER. Employing NiMoOx@NC as both the anode and cathode in the urea-assisted hydrogen evolution, the system outputs 50 mA cm(-2) at 1.680 V. This breakthrough provides an efficient and cost-effective approach for fabricating nickel molybdenum-based metal oxides.

Synergistic Effect of Urea on Vitamin C Electro-Oxidation at NiOx/CoOx Binary Catalysts Supported on Graphene Nanosheets	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY												The electro-oxidation of ascorbate (AAO) in the presence of urea at NiOx/CoOx/GNs/GC electrode is investigated. Cyclic voltammetry measurements show that the peak current (I (p)) of AAO at NiOx/CoOx/GNs/GC electrode is ten times that of GNs/GC electrode. This highlights the role of catalyst composition and order of deposition on the activity of AAO. Interestingly, blending ascorbate (AH(- )) with urea caused a significant promotion of AAO. Both the I (p) of AAO and the fuel utilization in the AH(-) /urea fuel blend solution are doubled when compared to those obtained at the same electrode in pure AH(-) solution (in addition to a favorable negative shift in the onset potential, E (onset) = 150 mV). Urea molecules are believed to act as anchoring molecules for AH(-) molecules at the NiOx/CoOx/GNs/GC surface with a favorable geometry facilitating its oxidation (by two-electron transfer process) to dehydroascorbate (DHA). Four interaction geometries are proposed, and comparative DFT calculations are conducted, displaying the relative stability and dipole moments of AH(-) in such a way that facilitates its adsorption and oxidation. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of the catalysts tailoring together with the selection of a smart blending fuel with AH(-).

However, low UEOR activity and the poisoning issue of the catalyst limit its practical application. Herein, a simple coordination reaction is used to synthesize the dimethylglyoxime-NiII complex (DMGNiII), which efficiently serves as the initial precursor to synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon nanorodsupported nickel phosphide nanoparticle (Ni2P/N-Cnanorods) nanocomposites. The density functional theory calculations and electrochemical results reveal that nitrogen doping can weaken the adsorption of hydrogen and the generated CO2, resulting in an enhancement of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UEOR activity. In addition, N-doping can also promote the generation of Ni3+, which can further promote the UEOR and HER performance. Concretely, the overpotential for the HER on Ni2P/N-Cnanorods-2h nanocomposites is only 201 mV at 10 mA cm-2, and the onset potential of the UEOR on Ni2P/NCnanorods-2h nanocomposites is only 1.34 V. Additionally, the Ni2P/N-Cnanorods nanocomposites also show excellent long-term stability due to the introduction of nitrogen-doped carbon material. Consequently, the symmetric Ni2P/N-Cnanorods-2h||Ni2P/N-Cnanorods-2h urea electrolyzer requires 1.41 V of electrolysis voltage for urea electrolysis, which can be applied in energy-saving H2 production and environment purification.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Urea and nitrophenol are abundant in industrial and agricultural wastes, human wastewater, and in the environment. Catalytic oxidative and reductive removal is the most effective process to remove urea and 4-nitrophenol from the environment, necessary to protect human health. 2D carbon-supported, cobalt nanoparticle-based materials are emerging catalysts for nitrophenol reduction and as an anode material for the UOR. In this work, cobalt modified on a porous organic polymer (CoPOP) was synthesized and carbonized at 400 and 600 degrees C. The formation of CoPOP was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy, the 2D graphitic layer and amorphous carbon with cobalt metal by TEM, SEM, and PXRD, and the elemental composition by TEM mapping, EDX, and XPS. The catalytic activity for the 4-nitrophenol reduction was studied and the related electrocatalytic UOR was scientifically evaluated. The catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP was tested with the addition of NaBH4; CoPOP-3 exhibited enhanced activity at a rate of 0.069 min(-1). Furthermore, LSV investigated the catalytic activity of materials toward UOR, producing hydrogen gas, the products of which were analyzed via gas chromatography. Among the electrocatalysts studied, CoPOP-2 exhibited a lower onset potential, and the Tafel slope was 1.34 V and 80 mV dec(-1). This study demonstrates that cobalt metal- doped porous organic polymers can be used as efficient catalysts to remove urea and nitrophenol from wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Fourier-transform infrared (FrIR) analysis indicated rapid degradation of the urea bonds in the hard segments, followed by chain scission and photo-Fries reaction of the urethane linkages. In the soft segments, the oxidation of the original ether groups resulted in the formation of large amounts of ester groups, while some crosslinking of the ether groups was also evident. Carbon black provided moderate protection against degradation, with the smallest-sized particles being the most effective. Protection was evidenced by reduced surface cracking as well as an increased resistance to chemical changes in both the soft segments and hard segments. Even so, significant degradation was still evident at low UV doses suggesting that further stabilisation is required to increase the UV durability of these elastomers and improve their long-term performance.

Herein, 3D nanostructures of Mo-Ni3S2 nanowire arrays densely grown on nickel foam (NF) were conceived and produced using a hydrothermal treatment. During the UOR process, S and Mo are electrooxidized to generate sulfite (SO32-) and molybdate (MoO42-), with SO32- further oxidized to sulfate (SO42-). Experiments proved that adding molybdate and sulfate actively improves the oxidation activity of Ni(OH)2 and optimizes the adsorption/desorption of the UOR intermediates. The well-conceived Mo-Ni3S2 bifunctional catalyst performs well in urea-aided hydrolysis at up to 82 mA cm-2 at a voltage of 1.57 V with little performance degradation over 50 h. A promising avenue for new insights into the mechanisms underlying anionic surface reconstruction in the UOR process is offered in this work.

The distribution of charge plays a pivotal role in promoting the adsorption and cleavage of chemical groups in urea molecules, which can be modulated by introducing a heterostructure. Herein, a CoS1.097/Ni3S2 heterojunction grown on nickel foam is designed, serving simultaneously for UOR and HER. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the spontaneous charge transfer at the CoS1.097/Ni3S2 heterointerface induces the formation of localized electrophilic/nucleophilic regions, intelligently adsorbing electron-donating/electron-withdrawing groups in urea molecules, activating chemical bonds, thereby triggering urea decomposition. CoS1.097/Ni3S2 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for urea, requiring only a potential of 1.22 V (with an overpotential of 0.85 V) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in UOR, and potentials of 1.27 and 1.57 V to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in a UOR//HER electrolysis cell, maintaining good stability at high current density for 60 h. Tests in real urine have demonstrated performance similar to that in urea electrolyte.

The key dilemma for this electrochemical route is the extremely high overpotentials required for oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. Innovative strategies are desirable to fabricate inexpensive metal-based multifunctional catalysts with robust catalytic performance and large-current durability for electrochemical hydrogen production in freshwater or urea-containing water. Here we report the rational design and synthesis of hydrangea-like CoP/Ni3FeN heterostructure arrays as excellent multifunctional electrocatalysts for both alkaline water and urea electrolysis. This catalyst presents superb trifunctional catalytic activities and outstanding large-current durability in basic media, requiring ultralow potentials of -0.160, 1.538 and 1.419 V to facilitate hydrogen, oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions (HER, OER and UOR) at an extremely large current density of 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, the as-constructed two-electrode cells using this electrocatalyst as both the cathode and anode demand extremely low cell voltages of 1.577 and 1.668 V to deliver 500 mA cm(-2) stably for urea and water electrolysis, respectively, suggesting its superb activity and outstanding stability for trifunctional catalysis. Operando Raman spectroscopic studies in combination with density functional theory calculations validate that the CoP/Ni3FeN hybrid can greatly facilitate the formation of active metal (oxy)hydroxide species for both OER and UOR, and also reduce the adsorption energy barriers of *H2O and *H intermediates for HER. This work provides an effective pathway for developing multifunctional catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen production at low voltages whenever fresh or urea-containing water is available.

Here, a facile electrochemical activation strategy was conceived and proposed to construct a Cu-doped NiOOH nanolayer encapsulated on Cu2O nanodendrites on Cu mesh substrate (Cu-NiOOH/Cu2O/CM) from the electrodeposited Ni/Cu2O/CM heterostructured precatalyst. It was verified that the incorporation of Cu not only facilitates the rapid formation of Ni(III) species but also contributes to the formation of Cu-Ni(III) bifunctional electrocatalytic active sites. Benefiting from the accessible Cu-Ni(III) dual active sites, high active surface area, good hydrophilic and aerophobic surface properties and superior electrical conductivity of the Cu mesh substrate, the as-prepared Cu-NiOOH/Cu2O/CM exhibits enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic abilities for electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Particularly, for the Cu-NiOOH/Cu2O/CM||Cu-NiOOH/Cu2O/CM configuration toward the UOR||HER coupled system, a significantly reduced cell voltage of 1.43 V vs. RHE @ 10 mA<middle dot>cm(-2) was obtained. The observed cell voltage for the conventional overall water splitting is approximately 190 mV higher than that observed for overall urea splitting. This study proposes a viable approach to achieve and optimize the bifunctional UOR/HER performance of NiOOH active species, which holds significant importance for efficient and stable hydrogen generation from urea-contaminated substandard water.

Herein, we report a bifunctional electrocatalyst synthesized by anchoring individually dispersed Ni single atoms on N-doped carbon nanosheets (Ni SAs-NC), which exhibits an outstanding overall performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Based on that, a conceptual urea-assisted rechargeable ZAB by coupling ORR with UOR of a low thermodynamic potential is demonstrated to have significantly decreased charging voltage and high urea elimination rate. The high bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of Ni SAs-NC endow the urea-assisted ZAB with a dramatically increased energy conversion efficiency of 71.8%, which is improved by 17.1% as compares with the conventional ZABs. The successful implementation of Ni SACs based urea-assisted rechargeable ZABs with an improved energy conversion efficiency may prompt ZAB technology towards practical applications.

Herein, a cross-alignment strategy of in situ vertically growing Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets on 2D semiconductor g-C3N4 is reported to form a hetero-structured electrocatalyst. Various spectroscopy measurements including in situ experiments indicate the existence of enhanced internal electric field at the interfaces of vertical Ni(OH)(2) and g-C3N4 nanosheets, favorable for balancing adsorption of reaction intermediates. This heterojunction electrocatalyst shows high-selectivity UOR compared to pure Ni(OH)(2), even at high potentials (>1.5 V) and large current density. The computational results show the vertical heterojunction could steer the internal electric field to increase the adsorption of urea, thus efficiently avoiding poisoning of strongly adsorbed OH- on active sites. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA)-based electrolyzer with the heterojunction anode could operate at an industrial-level current density of 200 mA cm(-2). This work paves an avenue for designing high-performance electrocatalysts by vertical cross-alignments of active components.

Green synthesis of NiO/Fe3O4@chitosan composite catalyst based on graphite for urea electro-oxidation	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												In this work, we modified the NiO-based graphite electrode by a green synthesis nanoparticles composite of magnetite@chitosan for urea electrooxidation (UEO) in 0.5 M KOH solution. Green magnetite (Fe3O4) nano -particles were prepared with green tea extract that acts as a reducing agent. The new composite catalyst Fe3O4@Chitosan performs a dual function to improve the catalytic properties of UEO. The magnetite Fe(3)O(4 )nanoparticles increase the active sites by accelerating the electron transfer between Fe3+/Fe(2+)ions, while chi-tosan enhances urea adsorption on the electrode surface. Three graphite electrodes were prepared with different NiO and Fe3O4@Chitosan catalysts ratios under optimized conditions and denoted by Ni0.85Fe0.15, Ni0.75Fe0.25, and Ni0.65Fe0.35. The excellent catalytic parameters as maximum current density (35.4 mA cm(-2)), Tafel slope (69 mVdec-1), diffusion coefficient (5.759 x 10(-6 )cm(2) s(- 1)), and onset potential (446 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) were achieved by Ni0.75Fe0.25 electrocatalyst. The modified NiO/Fe3O4@chitosan electrocatalyst was characterized by XRD and SEM/EDEX-elemental mapping techniques characterized its morphology and chemical structures. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry, double-step Choronoamerometery, and electrochemical impedance were employed to detect the electrodes' catalytic performance. The EIS fitting parameters deduced from R(RQ)& (RQ) equivalent circuits were used to explain how the Ni/Fe ratios' can affect the charge transfer process of UOR at the prepared elec-trocatalysts surfaces under the applied potentials.

Herein, by taking advantage of 2-Methylimidazole, of which is a kind of alkali in water and owns strong coordination ability to Co2+ in methanol, trace Co (1.0 mol%) addition was found to induce defect engineering on alpha-Ni(OH)(2) in a dual-solvent system of water and methanol. Physical characterization results revealed that the synthesized electrocatalyst (WM-Ni0.99Co0.01(OH)(2)) was a kind of defective nanosheet with thickness around 5-6 nm, attributing to the synergistic effect of Co doping and defect engineering, its electron structure was finely altered, and its specific surface area was tremendously enlarged from 68 to 172.3 m(2) g(-1). With all these merits, its overpotential to drive 10 mA cm(-2) was reduced by 110 mV.

Herein, we demonstrate an in -situ confined synthesis method that produces amorphous chromium oxide confined Ni/NiO nanoparticles-assembled nanosheets (Ni/ NiO@CrOx) with fast reaction kinetics towards UOR. The confinement effect of the in -situ generated CrOx overlay contributes to ultrafine Ni/NiO nanoparticles, bringing about rich Ni/NiO and NiO/CrOx interfaces. In -situ Raman and electrochemical characterization show that both CrOx and metallic Ni can promote the formation of the NiOOH species and the electron transfer, leading to high intrinsic activ-ity and fast reaction kinetics. At 1.40 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the Ni/NiO@CrOx delivers a cur-rent density of 275 mA cm-2, which is about 2.6 and 6.1 times as large as those of the NiO@CrOx and NiO, respectively. In addition, the protective effect of the CrOx overlay leads to robust working stability towards UOR. Further, the Ni/NiO@CrOx nanosheets are used as bifunctional catalysts for overall urea splitting, and a small electrolysis cell voltage of 1.44 V is needed to reach the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm-2.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, complicated procedures, high costs, and poor interfaces hinder commercialization. Here, an integrated electrode with tunable wettability derived from a hierarchically porous wood scaffold was well designed for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Interestingly, the outer sur -face of the wood lumen was optimized to the preferred wettability via stoichiometry to promote elec-trolyte permeation and gas escape. This catalyst exhibits outstanding activity and durability for UOR in alkaline media, requiring only a potential of 1.36 V (vs. RHE) to deliver 10 mA cm-2 and maintain its activity without significant decay for 60 h. These experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the nickel (oxy)hydroxide layer formed through surface reconstruction of nickel nanoparticles improves the active sites and intrinsic activity. Moreover, the superwetting properties of the electrode promote mass transfer by guaranteeing substantial contact with the electrolyte and accelerating the sep-aration of gaseous products during electrocatalysis. These findings provide the understanding needed to manipulate the surface wettability through rational design and fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts for gas-evolving processes.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Thermodynamically favourable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a class of promising routes for substituting sluggish OER and for coupling with cathodic hydrogen production because of smaller equilibrium potential (0.37 V) than that of OER (1.23 V). Herein, a versatile RuNiO/p-Ni catalyst was prepared through in -situ generating nickel hydroxide nanosheets on the surface of ordered porous Ni, then doping low Ru and annealing treatment. The optimized Ru-NiO/p-Ni displayed outstanding activity and stability towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), OER and UOR with potentials of -0.13 V, 1.57 V, and 1.39 V at 100 mA cm -2, respectively. Ru-NiO/p-Ni||Ru-NiO/p-Ni can achieve 100 mA cm -2 in ureaaided water splitting at a voltage of only 1.58 V, which is prominently 170 mV smaller than the voltage of water electrolysis (1.75 V). The excellent electrocatalytic performance is owing to the outstanding inherent activity generated by cooperative effect of Ru and NiO, along with rich defect and active centre of Ru-NiO/p-Ni supplied by the large surface area of 3D porous structure. The formation of more rich Ni active species with a high valence through transport of electrons between Ru and Ni is favourable to promoting the dissociation of urea molecules, eventually improving UOR. Therefore, it can facilitate urea -aided water splitting, which provides a valuable strategy for constructing versatile catalysts for a cathodic energy -efficient hydrogen production coupled with other anodic oxidation reactions.

Herein, we prepared Zn,S-incorporated Fe,Co layered double hydroxide (ZnCoFeS-LDH) nanosheets on nickel foam via a two-step hydrothermal reaction. The attractive two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet morphology with ultrathin thickness offers abundant active sites, promotes the adsorption and desorption of intermediates on the surface, and also facilitates mass transportation. The electronic structure of ZnCoFeS-LDH was modified, which thus improves their conductivity, offers high-valence iron ions (Fe3+), and therefore intrinsically enhances their electrocatalytic properties. In particular, the constructed crystalline/amorphous interfaces benefit electron transfer between different phases. As a proof of concept, we examined the electrocatalytic performances of ZnCoFeS-LDH nanostructures to both the OER and UOR. As a result, the ZnCoFeS-LDH nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic OER activity, with low overpotentials of 202, 217, 238, and 261 mV to achieve current densities of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are remarkably enhanced in comparison with that of commercial RuO2. Furthermore, they also demonstrate outstanding durability after long-term (48 h) and cycling (5000 cycles) measurements. Moreover, the ZnCoFeS-LDH nanosheets also possess superior UOR activity.

It exhibits high activity toward urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Regarding UOR, the onset potential of Ni-P-O is reduced by the introduction of Co and gradually decreases with the incremental of Co content in the film ascribed to the reduction of conversion potential of Ni2+/Ni3+. Concerning HER, the incorporated Co in Ni-P-O film not only increases the amounts of active sites, but also boost the synergetic effect on water dissociation and hydrogen desorption. Particularly, the optimum activity of Ni-P-O is achieved by the introduction of an 8% cobalt source (8% Co:Ni-P-O/NF), which offers the highest activity with the lowest overpotential of 94 mV and Tafel slope of 46.2 mV.dec(-1). Furthermore, the efficiency of hydrogen generation is further improved by urea-assistance over the electrolyzer coupled with 8% Co:Ni-P-O/NF electrode.

Particularly, the development of low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst gained attention for large-scale energy and clean-energy production. But now the emphasis is on developing low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst materials that show more than one electrocatalytic reactions. Hence, we have developed a highly porous and active edge plane exposed beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet on low-cost and flexible stainless-steel mesh (SSM) and investigated its catalytic activity for oxidation of urea, hydrazine, and water. The as-prepared beta-Ni(OH)(2)/SSM demonstrates the excellent catalytic activity towards the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with potential lower than the 1.45 V vs. RHE, 1.34 V vs. RHE, and 1.51 V vs. RHE at 50 mA/cm(2) current density, respectively. Furthermore, the as-prepared electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent stability in UOR, HzOR, and OER for long time. The promising electrocatalytic activity of as-prepared beta-Ni(OH)(2)/SSM electrocatalyst is attributed to the highly porous, and edge plane exposed binder-free thin nanosheets grown on SSM, which also adds to the mechanical structure stability and a large amount of mass transportation during electrocatalytic activity.

Even at high current densities demanded for commercial applications, the overpotentials remain very low ( eta 500 = 291 mV, eta 1000 = 319 mV). The catalytic activity of CoFe(OH) x -Co 3 O 4 /NF has exceeded that of most non -noble metal OER catalysts documented in the literature. Furthermore, the CoFe(OH) x -Co 3 O 4 /NF catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic stability to OER, with only a 23 mV potential increase after 24 h of stability testing at a high current density of 500 mA cm -2 . Owing to the heterostructure, the CoFe(OH) x -Co 3 O 4 /NF catalyst also exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and the use of UOR instead of OER at the anode of OWS significantly reduces the cell voltage, thereby reducing the electrolytic energy consumption. The findings in this work offer precious insights into the design of OWS anode catalysts and their important applications in industrial water electrolysis. These insights are crucial for advancing the development of highly efficient and sustainable water electrolysis processes, which is essential for the production of green hydrogen and other valuable chemicals.					feng, yuanyuan/GRO-2896-2022; Dongxing, Tan/GXF-0991-2022														0925-8388	1873-4669				AUG 5	2024	994								174706	10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.174706	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.174706		MAY 2024											WOS:001239345500001

In order to better separate ALA from PSO and to improve its purity and yield, a purification method for ALA that combines urea complexation (UC) with rapid preparative reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-RPLC) has been studied. Within the selected ranges of conditions, four one-factor experiments were found to have significant effects on the purity and yield of ALA from PSO. A response surface methodology (RSM) has been applied to optimize UC for separating and purifying ALA from PSO, which yielded optimal parameters of 95% ethanol/urea (w/w) = 5:1, urea/esterified fatty acids (E-FAs) (w/w) = 2:1, complexation time 16.3 h, and complexation temperature 17 degrees C. The optimal purity and optimal yield of the one-time purification ALA (OTP-ALA) obtained by UC thereby reached 86.977 +/- 0.082% and 34.696 +/- 0.948 %, respectively. Two-time purification conditions of OTP-ALA by RP-RPLC were also determined, and the purity of the two-time purification ALA (TTP-ALA) was increased to 99.200 +/- 0.061%, corresponding to a yield of 53.888 +/- 0.904 %. The effect of different added amounts of alpha-tocopherol on the oxidation stability of TTP-ALA has also been studied. Accelerated oxidation tests showed that the addition of alpha-tocopherol effectively inhibited the oxidation of TTP-ALA by reducing the peroxide value (PV).

Nickel hydroxides as electrocatalysts have been widely investigated for urea electrolysis. However, it is an open question how to synthesize highly catalytic Ni(OH)(2) for the PEC urea splitting. Herein, we take advantage of the instability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to perform an in situ synthesis of Ni(OH)(2) catalysts on the surface of TiO2 nanorod arrays. This transformed Ni(OH)(2) (T-Ni(OH)(2)) possesses a superior PEC catalytic activity for water/urea splitting in comparison to the Ni(OH)(2) prepared by the impregnation method. The in situ transition of a Ni-MOF is accomplished through an electrochemical treatment under AM1.5G illumination in a KOH-and-urea mixed electrolyte. The specific transition mechanism of Ni-MOFs is the substitution of ligands with OH- in a 1 M KOH electrolyte and the successive phase transition. The T-Ni(OH)(2)@TiO2 photoanode delivers a high photocurrent density of 1.22 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, which is 4.7 times that of Ni(OH)(2)@TiO2 prepared with the impregnation method. The onset potential of T-Ni(OH)(2)@TiO2 is negatively shifted by 118 mV in comparison to TiO2. Moreover, the decline of photocurrent during the continuous test can be recovered after the electrochemical and light treatments.

J	Wang, C; Du, XQ; Zhang, XS				Wang, Chao; Du, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Xiaoshuang			Controlled synthesis of Fe doped NiCoM (M=O, P, S and Se) as robust electrocatalyst for urea electrolysis	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												Electrochemistry urea electrolysis method is more significant in practical application and cost saving than water splitting technology for production of hydrogen. In this work, a series of Fe doped NiCoM (M=O, P, S and Se) materials with unique structure of nanosheet and nanoneedle were successfully synthesized on Ni foam by typical hydrothermal and annealing processes. What is noteworthy is that Fe-NiCoP, as an efficient bifunctional electrode, presents superior electrochemistry activity for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with requiring a potential of 1.369 V at 100 mA cm(-2 )and overpotential of 150 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). In the process of electrolysis of urea, the Fe-NiCoP//Fe-NiCoP electrode couple display superior electrochemical performance (cell voltage of 1.50 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)). The enhanced elec-trocatalytic activity of Fe-NiCoP electrodes was attributed to improved reaction kinetics by Ni12P5 and in-creased conductivity by Fe-Co2P, resulting in rapid electron transfer, increased active site exposure and good conductivity. Density functional theory calculations show that the Ni12P5 material exhibits a small Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption and plays a major role in hydrogen production. This work provides a novel idea for the research and exploitation of low cost and robust UOR and HER electrocatalysts. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

When adding urea and MB, the anodic current density of alpha-MoO3 reach 310.98 and 403.72 mA/cm(2) at 393 mV, which is 5.2 and 7.1 times higher than that (50.08 mA/cm(2)) in KOH electrolyte solution, respectively. It is proposed that the anodic oxidations of MB and urea are easier than water oxidation, thus increasing the anodic current greatly. Most importantly, the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction is also decreased obviously by MB and urea. At 40 mA/cm(2), the cell voltages of urea/KOH (1.611 V) and MB/KOH (1.597 V) systems have decreased by 16.53% and 17.56%, compared with the KOH system (1.93 V), respectively. It is seen the system is energy-saving obviously. The innovative design can not only efficiently produce hydrogen but also can degrade environmental pollutants concurrently. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their associated LOBs have long been plagued by large charge overpotential, which is closely related to the sluggish two-electron Li2O2 oxidation mechanism. Here, we report a new electrolyte solvent-1,1,3,3-tetramethylurea (TMU) for LOBs with high performance and an alternative mechanism, where a kinetically favorable one-electron Li2O2 oxidation pathway can happen in the urea electrolyte system, thus leading to a much lower charge overpotential (approximate to 0.51 V) compared to the tetraglyme-based LOBs (approximate to 1.27 V). Besides, TMU also exhibits good stability since it does not contain any alpha-hydrogen atoms that are vulnerable to be attacked by superoxide species, thus suppressing the hydrogen abstraction side reactions. Consequently, the TMU-based LOBs can stably work for more than 135 cycles, which is four times that of the tetraglyme-based LOBs (approximate to 28 cycles).

Here, a series of CrxPy-a/ComPn-b composites were synthesized on Ni foam through hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphorization process for the first time. It is worth noting that CrxPy-1/ComPn-3@NF exhibited excellent UOR performance (1.331 V at 100 mA cm-2) and HER performance (0.299 V at 100 mA cm-2) in an electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea due to the synergistic effect of Cr-Co. The CrxPy-1/ComPn-3@NF|| CrxPy-1/ComPn-3@NF two-electrode system call for only 1.52 V to provide current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is one of the best electrochemistry performances reported up to now. Experimental analysis show that the promoted electrochemistry performances is assigned to faster charge transfer rate, the exposure of more reaction site and better properties of metals. Density Functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the presence of the ComPn material accelerates the kinetics of hydrogen production and the CrxPy material improves the properties of metals for the electrode.

Focusing on the NOR mediated by the beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrode, we decipher the transformation mechanism of the nitrogenous nucleophile. For the two-step NOR, proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the bridge between electrocatalytic dehydrogenation from beta-Ni(OH)(2) to beta-Ni(OH)O, and the spontaneous nucleophile dehydrogenative oxidation reaction. This theory can give a good explanation for hydrazine and primary amine oxidation reactions, but is insufficient for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Through operando tracing of bond rupture and formation processes during the UOR, as well as theoretical calculations, we propose a possible UOR mechanism whereby intramolecular coupling of the N-N bond, accompanied by PCET, hydration and rearrangement processes, results in high performance and ca. 100 % N-2 selectivity. These discoveries clarify the evolution of nitrogenous molecules during the NOR, and they elucidate fundamental aspects of electrocatalysis involving nitrogen-containing species.

In this study, we employed a one-pot hydrothermal method to directly synthesize Ni(OH)(2)-Ni3S2/NF hybrid nanoflowers on a nickel foam (NF) substrate, resulting in efficient and stable bi-functional electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Under alkaline conditions, the Ni(OH)(2)-Ni3S2/NF catalyst exhibits low voltage requirements of 1.346 V and -0.014 V vs. RHE with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for UOR and HER, respectively. Furthermore, when employing the Ni(OH)(2)-Ni3S2/NF catalyst as both anode and cathode for urea-assisted overall water splitting, it requires a cell voltage of merely 1.396 V with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is notably lower than the voltage required for complete water decomposition at the same current density (1.568 V vs. RHE).

The unique morphology endows the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties, allowing for the rapid contact with the reactants and rapid removal of surface-generated gases. As a result, the CoP/CoMoO 4 -CC shows efficient bifunctional activity. This work offers a new avenue to rationally design bifunctional electrocatalysts for large-scale practical hydrogen production.

One-electron oxidation of the complexes initiates an unprecedented redox-induced electron transfer process, leading to monocationic copper(I) complexes [Cu(L1)(2)](+) and [Cu(L2)(2)](+) with two oxidised ligands. While [Cu(L1)(2)](+) is best described as a Cu-I complex with two neutral radical ligands that couple antiferromagnetically, [Cu(L2)(2)](+) is a Cu-I complex with two clearly different ligand units in the solid state and with a magnetic susceptibility close to a diamagnetic compound. Further one-electron oxidation of the complex with L1 ligands results in a dication [Cu(L1)(2)](2+), best described as a Cu-I complex with a twofold oxidised, monocationic ligand and a neutral radical ligand. The stability in at least three redox states, the accumulation of spin density at the ligands and the facile ligand-metal electron transfer make these complexes highly attractive for a variety of applications; here the catalytic aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is tested.

For sensing and switching processes a redox-active unit, such as the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple, is especially suitable. Here, self-assembly processes of redox-active ferrocenyl(thio)ureas FcNHC(X)NHR [X = O, R = Fc (1), Ph (2), 1-naphthyl (3), Me (4), Et (5); X = S, R = Fc (6), 1-anthracenyl (7)] through hydrogen bonds - both in the solid state and in THF and CH2Cl2 solution - are reported. Special emphasis is placed on the impact of nonclassical intramolecular NHFe hydrogen bonds in these organometallic systems [these are absent in conventional organic (thio)ureas] on conformation and assembly. Furthermore, conformational switching and disassembly of 1-6 is induced by oxidation of 1-6 to the corresponding ferrocenium cations 1(+)-6(+) (redox switch).

Introduction of surface defects in NiO with effective removal of adsorbed catalyst poisons for improved electrochemical urea oxidation	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising low cost method to replace water oxidation reaction for low energy electrochemical hydrogen production. The important factors to be considered in order to attain better UOR efficiency are electrocatalyst design by tuning defects and surface area and effective removal of CO2 poisoning on the catalyst surface. In this study, we have prepared surface oxidised NiO (e-NiO) with surface defects by electron beam bombardment and shown it to oxidize urea more effectively than pristine NiO with an onset potential of 0.33 V vs Ag/AgCl(sat.KCl) and Tafel slope of 34.69 mV/dec for 0.4 M urea in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The higher UOR current density exhibited by eNiO is associated with the higher number of Ni3+ ions on the surface as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, leading to enhanced formation of NiO(OH) active species. A combination of voltammetry and impedance studies are presented to understand the active species formation and surface poisoning by released CO2 species. The dominant surface poisoning on e-NiO resulting from enhanced defects can be removed by increasing KOH concentration and the impedance spectra discloses effective removal of CO2 in 6 M KOH and 0.4 M urea. This is reflected in the UOR performance of e-NiO as drastic reduction in Tafel slope (22.29 mV/dec), lower onset potential (0.24 V vs Ag/AgCl(sat.KCl)) and high UOR current maxima of 20 mA/cm(2) at the applied potential of 0.35 V vs Ag/AgCl(sat.KCl). The correlation of indirect and direct electrochemical urea oxidation reactions in pristine and e-NiO catalysts can be explained in terms of the strength of urea adsorption on surface sites derived from voltammograms and fitted impedance spectra.

However, developing cheap and highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall urea electrolysis remains challenging. In this work, a metastable Cu0.5Ni0.5 alloy is synthesized by a one-step electrodeposition method. It only requires the potentials of 1.33 and -28 mV to obtain the current density of +/- 10 mA cm(-2) for UOR and HER, respectively. The metastable alloy is considered to be the main reason causing the above excellent performances. In the alkaline medium, the as-prepared Cu0.5Ni0.5 alloy exhibits good stability for HER; and conversely, NiOOH species can be rapidly formed during the UOR due to the phase segregation of Cu0.5Ni0.5 alloy. In particular, for the energy-saving hydrogen generation system coupled with HER and UOR, only 1.38 V of voltage is needed at 10 mA cm(-2); and at 100 mA cm(-2), the voltage decreases by approximate to 305 mV compared with that of the routine water electrolysis system (HER || OER). Compared with some catalysts reported recently, the Cu0.5Ni0.5 catalyst owns superior electrocatalytic activity and durability. Furthermore, this work provides a simple, mild, and rapid method for designing highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts toward urea-supporting overall water splitting.

In this work, NiO nanoparticles that incorporated graphene as the NiO@Graphene composite were constructed to study the UOR process in terms of density functional theory. The single-atom model, which differed from the previous heterojunction model, was employed for the adsorption/desorption of urea and CO2 in the alkaline media. As demonstrated from the calculated results, NiO@Graphene prefers to adsorb the hydroxyl group than urea in the initial stage due to the stronger adsorption energy of the hydroxyl group. After NiOOH@Graphene was formed in the alkaline electrolyte, it presents excellent desorption energy of CO2 in the rate-determining step. Electronic density difference and the d band center diagram further confirmed that the Ni(III) species is the most favorable site for urea oxidation while facilitating charge transfer between urea and NiO@Graphene. Moreover, graphene provides a large surface for the incorporation of NiO nanoparticles, enhancing the electron transfer between NiOOH and graphene and promoting the mass transport in the alkaline electrolyte. Notably, this work provides theoretical guidance for the electrochemical urea oxidation work.

Unfortunately, especially in the field of urea fuel cells, most of the reported electrocatalysts do not own this very important feature. NiMn nanoparticles-decorated activated carbon is introduced as strongly enhanced onset potential and highly effective electrocatalyst for urea oxidation. For bimetallic nanoparticles having 10 wt% Mn, the corresponding onset potential is -85 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a corresponding current density of 130 mAcm(-2). However, other contents (0, 20 and 30 wt%) of Mn do not show this high improvement in the electrocatalytic activities. Decoration of the activated carbon can be achieved by hydrothermal treatment of the metals acetates/activated carbon aqueous suspension followed by fast cooling to perform sudden transformation of the subcritical water to a normal one. Later on, the powder is sintered in argon atmosphere at 850 degrees C. Fortunately, the characterizations confirmed that the modified activated carbon is decorated by pristine NiMn nanoparticles rather than the expected oxides.

MnO2/MnCo2O4/Ni heterostructure with quadruple hierarchy: a bifunctional electrode architecture for overall urea oxidation	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A												A three-dimensional MnO2/MnCo2O4/Ni core-shell heterostructured electrode has been fabricated through a facile method. This electrode architecture consists of four levels of interconnected hierarchy: a primary macroporous Ni foam scaffold (>= 500 mm), an intermediate vertically-aligned MnCo2O4 core-nanoflake array (50-100 nm), topmost ultra-thin MnO2 nanosheets (similar to 10 nm) and short-range ordered mesopores (similar to 5 nm) on the MnO2 nanosheets. This freestanding, hierarchical porous electrode has advantages in enhancing electroactive surface area, enabling efficient mass transport through the porous structure. The heterostructured electrode exhibits a low onset potential (1.33 V vs. RHE), a high anodic peak current density (1000 mA cm(-2) g(-1) at 1.7 V vs. RHE) and long-term catalytic stability for urea oxidation, which surpasses previous reported electrode materials for urea electrolysis. Remarkably, the MnO2/MnCo2O4/Ni electrode possesses bifunctional catalytic activity for both urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution. A urea electrolytic cell with both anode and cathode using the heterostructured electrodes has been fabricated and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) has been achieved at a cell voltage of 1.55 V. This noble metal-free quadruple hierarchy electrode shows potential as a new platform for multi-purpose applications.

The 20% CdS@Bi2WO6 sample exhibits optimal activity under visible light, achieving a urea yield of 10.0 mu mol<middle dot>g(-1)<middle dot>h(-1). The photocatalytic efficacy of this composite is attributed to its S-type heterojunction, which can significantly enhance the redox capacity and the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation compared to individual semiconductor components. CdS appears to be responsible for the photocatalytic reduction of N-2 and urea synthesis, while Bi2WO6 is involved in the oxidation of H2O to form O-2 and H+. It is suggested that urea is synthesized on the surface of CdS through two mechanisms: (I) the reaction between the activated intermediates of CO2 and N-2 (mainly) and (II) the reaction of the in situ formed NH3 with the feed CO2.

However, the cell voltage of an electrolyzer is still too high for practical application, which is mainly limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction process. To this end, hybrid water electrolyzers have drawn tremendous attention. Herein, coaxial Ni/Ni3S2@N-doped nanofibers are directly grown on nickel foam (NF), which is highly active for hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the Ni3S2@N-doped nanofibers on NF prepared in an Ar atmosphere display superior urea oxidation reaction performance to previously reported catalysts. The cell voltage is about 1.50 V in urea electrolysis to deliver a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), lower than that of a traditional water electrolyzer (1.82 V). The current density is around 77% relative to its initial value of 20 mA cm(-2) after 20 h, superior to Pt/ClIr/C-based urea electrolysis (14%). It is found that the synergistic effect between metallic Ni and Ni3S2, as well as the interfacial effect between metal centers and N-doped carbon, favors the initial dissociation of H2O and the adsorption/desorption of H* with thermal neutral Gibbs free energy. Meanwhile, the in-situ generated NiOOH on the outer surface of Ni3S2 possessed lower electrochemical activation energy for urea decomposition. Meanwhile, the abundant oxygen vacancies in electrodes could expose more active sites for the adsorption of intermediates, including H* and OOH*. It is also found that the hierarchical nanostructure of densely packed nanowires provides ideal electronic and ionic transport paths for fast electrocatalytic kinetics. The present work indicated that the modulation of compositions and hierarchical nanostructure is effective to prepare efficient catalysts for H-2 production via urea electrolysis.					zhang, yuanyuan/GYA-4428-2022; Qiu, Yunfeng/J-3193-2017	Qiu, Yunfeng/0000-0002-0163-4908													1944-8244	1944-8252				JAN 27	2021	13	3					3937	3948		10.1021/acsami.0c19117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c19117		JAN 2021						33439615					WOS:000614062400040

The discovery of highly effective electrocatalysts, capable of driving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea-alkaline environments, is pivotal for advancing large-scale hydrogen production. This study aims to introduce a new method that involves creating nanosheets of high-loading iridium single atoms embedded in a manganese-containing nickel oxyhydroxide matrix (Ir@Mn & horbar;NiOOH). These nanostructures are derived from self-supported hydrate pre-catalyst nanosheets grown on nickel foam and then activated through electrochemical etching pretreatment. The Ir@Mn & horbar;NiOOH nanoarchitecture displays outstanding electrocatalytic activity, having a low overpotential of just 258 mV and a potential of 1.319 V (at 10 mA cm-2) for OER and UOR, respectively. Such extraordinary catalytic characteristics of Ir@Mn & horbar;NiOOH is mainly owing to the strong synthetic electronic interaction between Ir single atoms and Mn & horbar;NiOOH, which can change its electronic characteristics and boost electrochemical catalytic sites. This research presents a new way to produce exceptionally efficient catalysts by adding a synergistic effect to complex multi-electron processes.

Evidence for Exclusive Direct Mechanism of Urea Electro-Oxidation Driven by In Situ-Generated Resilient Active Species on a Rare-Earth Nickelate	ACS CATALYSIS												Stabilization of active NiOOH species for achieving exclusive operation of the direct mechanism of the urea electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) presents a formidable challenge. Despite the extensive repertoire of UOR electrocatalysts developed so far, the sustenance of active NiOOH species throughout the reaction remains unaccomplished due to the predominant operation of the indirect mechanism that involves the reduction of NiOOH into Ni(OH)(2) during electrocatalysis. The capability of a UOR electrocatalyst to retain the active species is of paramount importance as it ensures the optimal engagement of the maximum pool of active Ni centers in the electrocatalytic process, resulting in enhanced activity with reduced Ni mass loading. In this context, the present study unveils the electrocatalytic UOR capability of a rare-earth nickelate, NdNiO3, showcasing high UOR activity with a reduced burden of Ni mass loading. From the detailed cyclic voltammetry studies, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and impedance analyses, it has been substantiated that NdNiO3 triggers the UOR to proceed through the unconventional direct mechanism, obviating the need for catalyst regeneration during UOR. The adsorption free energy calculation of reactants such as urea, OH- ions, and product CO2 reveals that NdNiO3 effectively interacts with the reactants, and its surface is highly tolerant toward COx poison when compared to NiO.

J	Wei, DD; Tang, WJ; Wang, YL				Wei, Dandan; Tang, Wujian; Wang, Yinling			Hairy sphere-like Ni9S8/CuS/Cu2O composites grown on nickel foam as bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and urea electrooxidation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												The urea solution electrolysis has become more attractive than water splitting, because it not only produces clean H-2 via the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with lower cell voltage, but also treats sewage containing urea through anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR). However, lack of efficient electrocatalysts for HER and UOR has limited its development. Herein, hairy sphere -like Ni9S8/CuS/Cu2O composites were synthesized on nickel foam (NF) in situ by a two-step hydrothermal method. The Ni9S8/CuS/Cu2O/NF exhibited good electrocatalytic activity for both HER (-0.146 V vs. RHE to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)) and UOR (1.357 V vs. RHE to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)). Based on the bifunctional properties of Ni9S8/CuS/Cu2O/NF, a dual-electrode urea solution electrolytic cell was constructed, which only needed a low voltage of 1.47 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and displayed a good stability during a 20-h test. In addition, the reason for the good catalytic activity of Ni9S8/CuS/Cu2O/NF was analyzed and the UOR mechanism was discussed in detail. Our research shows that Ni9S8/CuS/Cu2O/NF is a very promising low-cost dual-function electrocatalyst, which can be used for high-efficiency electrolysis of urea solution to produce hydrogen and treat wastewater.

For a good understanding and further improvement, the mechanism investigation on the NO removal by urea combined with H2O2 is essential. The denitrification mechanism is calculated and studied in detail by Quantum Chemistry in this paper. Results show that the most possible denitrification route is that oxidizing NO by H2O2 to produce HNO2 and then absorbing HNO2 by urea to produce N-2, CO2 and H2O. The activation energy of NO oxidation by H2O2 (71.12 kJ/mol) is higher than that of HNO2 absorption by urea (60.17 kJ/mol). This indicates reaction H2O2 + 2NO -> 2HNO(2) is the rate-determining step and more difficult to carry out. The constraints of the NO removal are coming from NO oxidation rather than absorption in solution. Improving NO oxidation rate is the key to denitrification. The theoretical results in this paper provide theoretical basis and data reference for subsequent technological development.					黄, 学峰/HNR-6827-2023; Li, Yuan/AAX-4391-2020	Li, Yuan/0000-0002-2891-8919													2193-567X	2191-4281				FEB	2020	45	2					543	550		10.1007/s13369-019-04282-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-019-04282-y		DEC 2019											WOS:000499974300001

Herein, Mn-doped nickel hydroxide porous nanowire arrays (denoted Mn-Ni(OH)(2) PNAs) are rationally developed and evaluated as efficient catalysts for the UOR in an alkaline solution via the in situ electrochemical conversion of NiMn-based metal-organic frameworks. Mn doping can modulate the electronic structural configuration of Ni(OH)(2) to significantly increase the electron density and optimize the energy barriers of the CO*/NH2* intermediates of the UOR. Meanwhile, porous nanowire arrays will afford abundant spaces/channels to facilitate active site exposure and electron/mass transfer. As a result, the Mn-Ni(OH)(2) PNAs delivered superior UOR performance with a small potential of 1.37 V vs. RHE at 50 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1), and robust stability. Notably, the overall urea electrolysis system coupled with a commercial Pt/C cathode demonstrated excellent activity (1.40 Vat 20 mA cm(-2)) and durability operation (only 1.40% decay after 48 h).

Insight into the synergistic effect between nickel and tungsten carbide for catalyzing urea electrooxidation in alkaline electrolyte	APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL												Tungsten carbide modified nickel (Ni-WC/C) catalyst is synthesized through the sequential impregnation method and evaluated for the electrooxidation of urea in alkaline electrolyte. Both the activity and stability of Ni are enhanced by the introduction of WC. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements combined with electrochemical analysis were used to provide a better understanding of the mechanism for urea electrooxidation on the Ni-based catalysts. The formation of CO2 and NCO- species is detected during urea oxidation, and the synergistic effect resulting from the interaction of Ni and WC is also proposed. The Ni-WC/C electrode contributes to the improved C-N bond cleavage in urea than that on Ni/C, resulting in a higher activity. Furthermore, the introduction of WC also enhances the anti-poisoning ability, thus promoting more complete oxidation of urea to produce CO2, which leads to a higher energy conversion efficiency than that on Ni/C. This work provides a new strategy for designing highly efficient catalysts for urea electrooxidation.

NiCo2O4 nanosheets grown on current collectors as binder-free electrodes for hydrogen production via urea electrolysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												As a novel solid hydrogen carrier, urea (CO(NH2)(2)) has shown great promise in hydrogen production, hydrogen storage and transportation. Mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets were synthesized on current collectors and evaluated as binder free electrodes for hydrogen production via urea electrolysis. The as-grown NiCo2O4 nanosheet electrodes with 0.6 mg cm(-2) catalyst loading exhibit ca. 80 mV decreasing in the onset potential of urea oxidation in alkaline solution comparing to those of bulk nickel hydroxide modified electrodes. The NiCo2O4 nanosheet electrodes also improved the urea oxidation current density by at least 28 times at a constant potential of 0.50 V vs. Hg/HgO compared to that of bulk Ni(OH)(2) electrodes. The enhanced electrocatalytic performances of the binder free NiCo2O4 nanosheet electrodes may bring new opportunities for the scale-up of the urea electrolysis technology, which will benefit energy and environmental issues, such as urea rich wastewater treatment, hydrogen production, and fuel cells.

Dynamic active sites on plasma engraved Ni hydroxide for enhanced electro-catalytic urea oxidation	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY												The urea oxidization reaction (UOR) is an important anodic reaction in electro-catalytic energy conversion. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and complex catalyst transformation in electrocatalysis require activity improvement and better mechanistic understanding of the state-of-the-art Ni(OH)(2) catalyst. Herein, by utilizing low-temperature argon (Ar) plasma processing, tooth-wheel Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets self-supported on Ni foam (Ni(OH)(2)-Ar) are demonstrated to have improved UOR activity compared to conventional Ni(OH)(2). The theoretical assessment confirms that the edge has a smaller cation vacancy formation energy than the basal plane, consequently explaining the structural formation. Operando and quasi-operando methods are employed to investigate the dynamic evolution of the Ni(OH)(2) film in UOR. The crucial dehydrogenation products of Ni(OH)(5)O- intermediates are identified to be stable on the etched edge and explain the enhanced UOR in the low potential region. In addition, the dynamic active sites are monitored to elucidate the reaction mechanism in different potential ranges.

Herein, we report a facile H-2 vapor-assisted strategy for the controllable fabrication of the bimetallic active Co2Mo3O8 electrocatalyst for alkaline urea splitting, with an applied voltage of only 1.50 V required to deliver 50 mA cm(-2). Direct spectroscopic evidence and theoretical investigation demonstrate that the Co sites are responsible for the activation of intermediates, whereas the assisting Mo centers are identified as the OH or H radical mediators. Specifically, the synergistic effect of the Co-Mo dual sites was conclusively verified by the insitu Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations reveal that the short H-bonding (MoHO center dot center dot center dot H-NamineCO-Co) and Co-C-N-Mo configuration formed at the Co-Mo bridge are the key features determining a high reactivity for urea oxidation. The accelerated reaction rate is attributable to the conversion of the endoergic CO2 desorption to an exoergic reaction. In an alkaline H-2 evolution, Co atoms are the reaction sites for O-H bond cleavage of H2O, while Mo sites are considered to be the H-2-evolving centers. Determination of the individual functionality of synergistic dual centers represents a critical step towards the rational design of highlyefficient electrocatalysts.					zhang, kai/AAJ-7383-2020; Yu, Wenzheng/L-9424-2013														2211-2855	2211-3282				SEP	2021	87								106217	10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106217		JUN 2021											WOS:000685250300002

Herein, a Cu-Ni based selenide electrocatalyst (CuSey/NiSex/NF) was created using a hydrothermal technique and selenization treatment, featuring a heterogeneous interface rich in Cu2-xSe, Cu3Se2, Ni3Se4, and NiSe2. This catalyst demonstrated outstanding urea electrooxidation performance, achieving 10 mA cm(-2) with just 1.31 V and sustaining stability for 96 h. Through in-situ Raman spectroscopy and ex-situ characterizations, it is discovered that NiOOH is formed through surface reconstruction in the UOR process, with high-valence Ni serving as the key site for effective urea oxidation. Moreover, the electrochemical analysis revealed that CuSey had dual effects. An analysis of XPS and electrochemical tests revealed that electron transfer from CuSey to NiSex within the CuSey/NiSex/NF heterostructure enhanced the UOR kinetics of the catalyst. Additionally, according to the in-situ Raman spectroscopy findings, the existence of CuSey facilitates a easier and faster surface reconstruction of NiSex, leading to the creation of additional active sites for urea oxidation. More significantly, this work provides an excellent "precatalyst" for highly efficient UOR, along with an in-depth understanding of the mechanism behind the structural changes in electrocatalysts and the discovery of their true active sites.

This study successfully synthesizes nickel selenide and 3D nickel diselenide architectures on N-doped carbon using a NaCl-assisted method and selenization temperature regulation. The 3D architecture of the nickel diselenide with N-doped carbon obtained by selenization at 450 degrees C (NiSe2/NC-450) is a useful electrocatalyst for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). This NiSe2/NC-450 electrode displays good catalytic activity for MOR (high peak current density of similar to 164.68 mA cm(-2), low oxidation potential of similar to 1.33 Vat 10 mA cm(-2)) and UOR (high peak current density of similar to 136.04 mA cm(-2), low oxidation potential of similar to 1.32 Vat 10 mA cm(-2)). The strong methanol and urea reaction performance of NiSe2/NC-450 is attributed to the expanded electrochemically active area after selenization and the enhanced conductivity after N-doped carbon.

The superior structure and abundant sites play a crucial role in promoting the adsorption and cleavage of urea molecules. Therefore, this paper introduces a simple metal cation-induced gelation method to prepare an electrocatalyst with PtNi alloy-NiO dual sites supported on Ti3C2Tx, which simultaneously exhibits excellent UOR and HER performance. PtNi-NiOx/Ti3C2Tx demonstrates good catalytic activity for the urea oxidation reaction, requiring only 1.364 V (overpotential of 0.994 V) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm-2 in UOR, and also exhibits remarkable catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction, with PtNi-NiOx/Ti3C2Tx achieving a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in HER with only 24 mV of overpotential. In the UOR//HER two-electrode electrolysis cell, it requires only 1.361 and 1.538 V to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the dual active sites can intelligently adsorb the electron-donating/electron-withdrawing groups in urea molecules, activate chemical bonds, and thereby initiate urea decomposition.

Notably, the bimetallic and dual-anionic NiFeSP/NF electrode demonstrated good performance for the HER (42, 111 and 138 mV at current densities of -10, -100, and -200 mA cm-2, respectively), the OER (1.451, 1.502, 1.528, and 1.576 V vs. RHE at 10, 100, 200 and 400 mA cm-2, respectively), and the UOR (1.304, 1.346, 1.389 and 1.473 V vs. RHE at current densities of 10, 100, 200 and 400 mA cm-2, respectively). Moreover, the use of a NiFeSP/NF||NiFeSP/NF pair as an anode and a cathode in an overall water-splitting system assisted by urea achieved 1.348 and 1.582 V vs. RHE at 10 and 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea solution, which are 163 and 234 mV lower than those achieved in 1.0 M KOH alkaline solution, respectively. Additionally, the NiFeSP/NF||NiFeSP/NF pair demonstrates long-term stability (30 h) in a chronopotentiometry test at 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea solution. This bimetallic and dual-anionic NiFeSP electrode exhibits substantial catalytic activity due to the appropriate synergy between Fe and Ni, the modification of the electronic structure enabled by the dual anions, and the enhanced electrocatalytically active surface caused by high porosity. The low cost and single-step manufacturing method of the NiFeSP electrode, high electrocatalytic activity, and stability make it potentially ideal for commercial use in hydrogen generation and treatment of wastewater containing urea. A NiFeSP/NF electrocatalyst is a reliable candidate for increasing hydrogen production through urea electro-oxidation and it assists in the treatment of urea-rich wastewater.

The spectral study and microscopic analysis demonstrated the formation of NiSe2 nanoparticle/NiO nanosheet heterostructure and efficient Ni-O bond and Ni-Se bond synergism. Owing to various factors such as the strong synergetic coupling effects between NiSe2 nanoparticle and NiO nanosheet, unique structure features, increased active sites and amount of intrinsic Ni3+ ions, efficient synergism was found on the NiSe2 Nanoparticle/NiO nanosheet for urea-assisted water electrolysis by comparing with the NiSe2 Nanoparticle and NiO nanosheet alone. It required a cell voltage of 1.39 V, about 210 mV less than that of water electrolysis, confirming the less energy consumption during the electrolysis. Notably, it also shows remarkably superior long-term durability. The current work may extend the nanoparticle-nanosheet catalysts system for simultaneous wastewater treatment and clean energy production.

However, efficient catalysts are required for the practical implementation of urea splitting because of the high overpotentials of the urea oxidation reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, a Ni-modified direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for the urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions was synthesized by electroplating a WO3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite on Ni-decorated carbon felt (WO/CN-Ni@CF). The 2D/2D nanostructure of the as-synthesized WO3/g-C3N4 composite was confirmed by SEM and TEM. The WO/CN -Ni@CF catalyst electrode exhibited excellent bifunctional photocatalytic activity for the urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions. Consequently, the potential required to generate 100 mA cm-2 in an illuminated photoelectrochemical cell using WO/CN-Ni@CF as the anode and the cathode was reduced from 1.80 to 1.50 V. The photoelectrochemical cell exhibited good stability for 18 h with stable H2 generation. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts that exhibit exceptional efficiency and affordability for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenging task. In this work, a MOFs-derived bifunctional electrode of Co-doped Cu2_xSe with a hollow nanorod structure assembled from nanoparticles is prepared on a copper foam sub-strate (CoxCu2_xSe/CF) by a three-step synthesis process. As anticipated, the CoxCu2_xSe/CF self-supported electrode shows promising performance in terms of the UOR and HER. This can be attributed to the unique hollow nanorod structure assembled from nanoparticles and incorporation of Co dopants, which can expose more active sites, enhance the electrochemical surface area, and facilitate faster reaction kinetics. When CoxCu2_xSe/ CF was employed as the self-supported electrode for H2 production in a coupled HER||UOR system, only 1.51 V was required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm_2, which is 120 mV lower than the traditional water electrolysis system. And it also displays an outstanding stability, the current density retention ratio is approxi-mately 82.1 % after 70 h. Noteworthy, XRD, XPS and in-situ Raman analysis reveal that CoxCu2_xSe/CF can form highly active CuO and amorphous Cu(OH)2 as the active sites in UOR. This work proposes a strategy for H2 production and urea-containing wastewater treatment.					yang, xiao/KHT-9445-2024; Feng, Yuying/GWR-2972-2022; Zhang, Liqiang/E-6539-2015	Zhang, Li/0000-0002-6970-4562													0925-8388	1873-4669				JAN 5	2024	970								172517	10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172517	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172517		OCT 2023											WOS:001101361000001

In this work, novel twodimensional (2D) nickel-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) nanosheets comprising Ni2+ and an organic ligand of 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (Ni-DMAP-t, where t is the synthesis time) are firstly synthesized by a facile one-pot solvothermal method. By thickness regulation of Ni-DMAP-t nanosheets, the self-supported Ni-DMAP-2 with the smallest thickness on Ni foam (Ni-DMAP-2/NF) exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward UOR with a low potential of 1.45 V at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Moreover, by further coupling with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction, the urea-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production system using Ni-DMAP-2/NF as anode displays a dramatic voltage reduction by 290 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) as compared with that of conventional water electrolysis using the same electrodes. Such a superior UOR electrocatalytic activity of Ni-DMAP-2/NF is ascribed to the abundant Ni active sites exposed on the surface of Ni-DMAP-2, as well as the accelerated electron/ion transfer properties endowed by its ultrathin 2D nanosheets structure.

Urea electrolysis takes place at oxidative potentials of around 0.5- 0.6 V, reaching its maximum current density at & SIM;0.575 V, while oxygen release occurs above 0.6 V, indicating that electrochemical urea removal can be achieved under low-energy-input conditions. Scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to investigate the electrocatalytic performance of the Ni catalyst on an Au-layered glassy carbon electrode for urea oxidation. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was used to measure the valence of Ni catalysts, indicating urea-dependent changes in the intensity of the NiOOH peak and thus revealing that the NiIII is an active catalytic species. It evidenced that Raman bands corresponding to the speciation of Ni hydroxides were formed as oxidative mediates.

However, most of these catalysts are expensive and limited in supply, which limits their practical applications. Hence, metal-organic frameworks (MOF) have been explored as catalysts due to their low cost, easy preparation, and high redox activity. Here, we synthesize nickel-based MOF (Ni-MOF) via one-pot solvothermal technique as bifunctional electrocatalyst for the direct urea and nitrate fuel cell. The as -synthesized Ni-MOF is deposited on nickel foam (NF) and used as working electrode (Ni-MOF/NF) which demonstrates a peak current density of 188 mA/cm2 for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and-14 mA/cm2 for nitrate reduction reaction (NRR) at an onset potential of ti 1.58 V (vs RHE), and -1.12 V (vs RHE), respectively The enhanced functionality of the Ni-MOF/NF electrode can be attributed to the high cat-alytic efficacy of the Ni-MOF. This is mainly due to the presence of multiple oxidation states of N (i.e., Ni2+/3+) and excellent electronic conductivity of the organic ligands in MOF structure. Moreover, Ni-MOF/NF electrodes retain ti 71.2% and -83.9% capacity after 20000 s of UOR and NRR, respectively. This efficacy of the as-fabricated electrocatalyst proves MOF as a promising platform for direct fuel cell applications.(c) 2023 Society of Powder Technology Japan Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, stable partial nitritation for urea wastewater with urea increasing from 250 to 2000 mg L-1 were achieved in an aerobic SBR. Urea removal efficiency and nitrite accumulation percentage both kept above 98%, with nitrite production rate about 0.985 kg N.m(-3).d(-1). Urea hydrolysis mechanism in this aerobic system was described as, (1) massive urea in the bulk was absorbed into cell, (2) urea was hydrolyzed by intracellular urease inside cell, (3) produced ammonia then slowly diffused into the bulk through membrane, which is later converted by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) into nitrite. Due to this mechanism, the activity of AOB could not be inhibited by high FA (free ammonia) value under high urea concentration condition while nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) remained to be inhibited. An uncultured genus belonging to poorly characterized phylum Gemmatimonadetes was found enriched in this process and became dominant genus. This genus was speculated to have same energy pathway like ureaplasma, by absorbing excessive urea from environment and utilize urea hydrolysis to generate energy. So it was believed to be responsible for urea hydrolysis mechanism mentioned above. This SBR showed stable partial nitritation and high urea removal efficiency for treating urea wastewater, which was obviously feasible as the pretreatment process for subsequent ANAMMOX.

However, the fabrication of catalytically active heterostructures with elaborate architectures is still poorly developed owing to synthetic challenges, and the intrinsic mechanism of heterogeneous interfaces remains unclear because of insufficient evidence regarding real active sites. In this study, ultrafine homologous Ni2P-Co2P heterostructures (Ni2P-Co2P/C) are created using a topological transformation strategy from a Ni-Co layered double hydroxide/carbon (Ni-Co LDH/C) interconnected structure in a single nanosheet. When employed as catalysts in urea oxidation reaction (UOR), the Ni2P-Co2P/C heterostructures exhibit superior activity and stability, attributed to the optimized geometric and electronic structures of the catalytic sites. Specifically, it takes an ultralow potential of 1.27 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 28.71 mV dec(-1). The operando analyses and calculation results reveal that cobalt incorporation can reduce the generation potential of the surface reconstructive active species and optimize the absorption/desorption energy of the intermediates.

The Ni-MOFs were controllably synthesized via the facile solvothermal method. Among them, the Ni-MOF nanowires are endowed with the highest electrocatalytic activity due to the unique structure, more exposed active sites, lower charge transfer resistance, and the fast and direct electron transfer in 1D structures. The typical morphology of the Ni-MOF nanowires is ca. 10 nm in diameter and several micrometers in length. When employed as an electrocatalyst in urea oxidation reaction, it exhibits a lower overpotential than and superior stability to the NiMOFs with other morphologies. Ni-MOF nanowires require a potential of similar to 0.80 V (vs Ag/AgCl) to obtain 160 mA cm(-2). In addition, after continuous electrocatalyzing for 3600 s at 0.40 V (vs Ag/AgCl), the current density retention of Ni-MOF nanowires could still reach more than 60% (>12 mA cm(-2)), which demonstrates Ni-MOF nanowires as promising electrocatalysts for urea oxidation.					lin, liu/KGK-6263-2024; Sun, Zemin/HTP-6326-2023; Yuan, Mengwei/ISU-6874-2023	Lin, Liu/0000-0002-9922-4092; Li, Huifeng/0000-0002-0257-3967; Yuan, Mengwei/0000-0003-0060-1108													0020-1669	1520-510X				SEP 2	2019	58	17					11449	11457		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01124								31397562					WOS:000484066500020

Featuring the simple surface treatments of electrode substrate, including elemental leaching to modulate the Ni/Fe ratio in KSCN solution and subsequent chronopotentiometric aging in test solution, the as-fabricated anode can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 1.355 V (RHE) in 1 M KOH solution containing 0.33 M urea, without suffering all the disadvantages of traditional anodes, e.g., complicated fabrication process and impossible substrate regeneration. It was evidenced that Ni can be sustained at first and oxidized subsequently to form UOR-active species in divalent or trivalent states; whereas Fe, after elemental leaching, can be mainly oxidized to form Fe3O4 with acceptable electric conductivity, and the remnant is incorporated into the lattices of Ni-containing species for Ni-Fe synergy. Thus, the outstanding UOR performance is directly associated with the hetero-structure composed mainly of the UOR-active LDH decorated with the electrically conductive Fe3O4 particles and other UOR-enhancing (oxy)hydroxides.

Catalytic urea electrooxidation on nickel-metal hydroxide foams for use in a simplified dialysis device	AICHE JOURNAL												Electrocatalytic urea removal is a promising technology for artificial kidney dialysis and wastewater treatment.

However, due to the slow kinetics and large thermodynamic potential requirements of anodic OER, water splitting process still needs high energy consumption. In this aspect, replacing the OER by urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with low thermodynamic potentials can endow opportunity for less energy consumption for hydrogen production. At the same time, the electrochemical UOR offers a good access to treat urea-rich waste water. As the anodic UOR involves a 6e(-) transfer process, it needs high-performance and low-cost electrocatalysts to boost the efficiency. Herein, through W doping, we fabricated a 3D NiS2/MoO2 hybrid heterostructure grown on conductive carbon cloth (W-NiS2/MoO2@CC). Due to the W-induced abundant active sites, the as-fabricated WNiS2/MoO2@CC demonstrates excellent bifunctional catalytic activities toward UOR and HER with very low potentials of 1.3 V and 52 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. More importantly, benefiting from the combined merits of the hybrid heterojunction of NiS2 and MoO2, W-doping and the 3D porous structure grown on conductive carbon cloth support, the catalyst exhibits highly efficient catalytic performance towards a urea electrolytic cell (HER||UOR). Substantially, reduced cell voltage of 1.372 V is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 230 mV lower than that of conventional water electrolysis. In the meantime, the catalyst shows excellent stability with ignorable degradation of current density for 24 h. This work provides an effective catalyst design strategy for energy-saving electrochemical H2 production.

However, the UOR involves a slow 6-electron transfer dynamic, necessitating the utilization of high-performance catalysts to enhance catalytic efficiency. In this work, a bifunctional transition metal-based catalysts, namely, MoO2-NiO/NF heterostructure, is effectively synthesized using two-step hydrothermal methods and calcination. Benefiting from the heterogeneous interface, the nanoflower-like structure as well as the electron density redistribution, the MoO2-NiO/NF catalyst demonstrates remarkable durability and performance, with an overpotential of 139 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 for UOR. In addition, the bifunctional catalyst is used in a two-electrode electrolyzer, where a current density of 10 mA cm-2 is attained at a potential of 1.317 V, which is 261 mV smaller than that of the conventional water splitting system. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the MoO2-NiO/NF heterostructure exhibits a higher density cloud in the vicinity of the Fermi level, revealing that it has faster electron transfer and higher electrical conductivity. Besides, the Mo sites and Ni sites are favorable for adsorption of CO(NH2)2 and H2O, respectively, which might optimize the reaction intermediates adsorption/ desorption for UOR/HER, ultimately leading to the high electrocatalytic performance of MoO2-NiO/NF. This research opens a new window for the development of advanced heterojunction electrocatalysts assisted by urea electrocatalysis for cost-effective hydrogen production.

Nonetheless, electrocatalytic urea oxidation still suffers from its high energy barrier, sluggish kinetics and intricate reaction mechanism. Low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts towards the UOR with satisfactory activity and long lifespan are still lacking, and the underlying electrochemical mechanisms are not fully understood yet. Herein, an electrocatalyst of heterostructured cobalt-and-nickel-based-sulfides anchored on nickel foam (Co-Ni-S@NF) with a designed interface between Ni3S2 and Co9S8 was designed and synthesized via a one-step solvothermal method, exhibiting excellent urea electrooxidation activity (100 mA cm(-2) at 1.35 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and stability (100 h at 100 mA cm(-2)). Detailed structural and compositional characterization, along with electrochemical measurements reveals that the interface induced charge transfer between the strongly coupled Ni3S2 and Co9S8 could enhance the catalytic activity and stability of the hybrid material. In situ Raman and in situ Fourier transform infrared measurements clarify the voltage-driven self-reconstruction process based on different catalyst surfaces and help to understand the reaction pathway on the basis of the detected intermediated species. The ultrahigh UOR performance of Co-Ni-S@NF can be attributed to the incorporated Co element accelerating the structural evolution of Ni3S2 and facilitating the formation of high-valent Ni species, which are highly relevant to urea decomposition efficiency. The Co-Ni-S@NF electrode contributes to the improved C-N and N-H bond cleavage in urea and achieves a high-speed production of CO2, resulting in a higher activity upon the UOR. DFT calculations indicate sufficient charge exchange and defect formation at the heterointerface which boost the urea oxidation reaction. This work opens a new avenue to develop efficient electrocatalysts with a designed heterostructure and interface for electrochemical hydrogen production.

Influence of urea on electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol on porous CuOx/Cu foam anode in alkaline medium	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE												This study addresses the enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) at Cu oxide (CuOx) microporous catalyst in alkaline medium. A foam-like microporous CuOx film is successfully electrodeposited using the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) technique. The structural and morphological characterizations of the microporous film are carried out by XRD and SEM techniques, respectively. The influence of urea (as a blending fuel) on the electro-oxidation of EG is investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry (i-t) measurements. The oxidation peak current of EG is improved by addition of urea with a concurrent favorable negative shift of the onset potential of the oxidation process. A plausible model in which the formation of a linear chain and/or a 9-membered ring structures is proposed between urea and EG (via hydrogen bonding) with a favorable total lower energy and enhanced dipole moment (as evident from DFT calculations). This geometry enhances the proper adsorption orientation of EG on the electrode surface and thus facilitates its oxidation.																			1452-3981					OCT	2022	17	10							221016	10.20964/2022.10.41	http://dx.doi.org/10.20964/2022.10.41													WOS:000885086000016

Focusing on this topic, electrocatalytic oxidation reactions including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are highly attractive, which could be involved as efficient anodic reactions to couple the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) more efficiently. Currently, abundant transition metal-based catalysts have been explored for OER and UOR, while few bifunctional catalysts with versatile application range are reported, and the current activity and operational stability are still unsatisfied. Herein, we proposed a self-sacrificial templated route to fabricate uniform CuFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes grown on Cu(OH)2 nanoarrays as efficient pre-catalysts for both OER and UOR catalysis. After undergoing a pre-oxidation process with substantial accumulation of the active species, highly efficient and ultrastable electro-oxidation behavior can be achieved for promoted OER and UOR. Typically, an ultralow onset potential of 1.423 V vs. RHE with high catalytic current density can be achieved for OER, and an ultralow potential of 1.248 V vs. RHE is required for the optimized catalyst to achieve a 10 mA cm-2 UOR current density. Of note, over 300 h and 150 h stable current can be realized for OER and UOR, accompanied by dramatic increment of the activities. The discovery of the PBA-based pre-catalysts and the investigation of the pre-oxidation process could give useful guidance for future designing of advanced catalysts for the electro-oxidation reactions.

The effects of different N-doping methods (one-step and two-step method), dried sludge (DS)/urea mass ratios (5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1), SC preparation procedures (pyrolysis only, pyrolysis with acid washing, and pyrolysis with KOH activation and acid washing), and different pyrolysis temperatures (500, 600, 700, and 800 degrees C) on the catalytic oxidation of NO were compared to optimize the procedure for SC preparation. The results indicated that N-doping could obviously promote the catalytic performance of SC. The one-step method with simultaneous sludge pyrolysis (at 700 degrees C), KOH activation, and N-doping (DS/urea of 3:1) was the optimal procedure for preparing the N-doped SC with the NO conversion rate of 54.7%, whereas the optimal NO conversion rate of SC without N-doping was only 47.3%. Urea worked both as carbon and nitrogen source, which could increase about 2.9%-16.5% of carbon and 24.8%-42.7% of nitrogen content in SC pyrolyzed at 700 degrees C. N-doping significantly promoted microporosity of SC. The optimal N-doped SC showed specific surface areas of 571.38 m2 /g, much higher than 374.34 m2 /g of the optimal SC without N-doping. In addition, N-doping also increased amorphousness and surface basicity of SC through the formation of N-containing groups. Finally, three reaction paths, i.e. microporous reactor, active sites, and basic site control path, were proposed to explain the mechanism of N-doping on promoting the catalytic performance of NO.

Here, we report the electrodeposition of nickel hydroxide catalyst on commercial carbon paper (CP) electrodes from dimethyl sulphoxide solvent (Ni(OH)(2)-DMSO/CP) for urea electrooxidation under alkaline conditions. The physicochemical features of Ni(OH)(2)-DMSO/CP catalysts using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the Ni(OH)(2)-DMSO/CP catalyst shows nanoparticle features, with loading of <1 wt%. The cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the Ni(OH)(2)-DMSO/CP electrode has a urea oxidation onset potential of 0.33 V vs. Ag/AgCl and superior electrocatalytic performance, which is a more than 2-fold higher activity in comparison with the counterpart Ni(OH)(2) catalyst prepared from the aqueous electrolyte. As expected, the enhancement in electrocatalytic activity towards urea was associated with the superficial enrichment in the electrochemically active surface area of the Ni(OH)(2)-DMSO/CP electrodes. The results might be a promising way to activate commercial carbon paper with efficient transition metal electrocatalysts, for urea electrooxidation uses in sustainable energy systems, and for relieving water contamination.

Herein, we fabricate a Ni/WO3 Mott-Schottky heterojunction electrocatalyst with a hedgehog-like structure supported on Ni foam toward alkaline urea splitting. Different Ni/WO3 morphologies, such as microspheres, hedgehog-like structures, octahedrons, and cubes, were obtained when various ratios of Ni/W feeds were used. The Mott-Schottky nanointerfaces between Ni and WO3 domains are visually confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images, which also accelerated the charge transfer rate. Benefiting from the high electrochemically active surface area and enhanced charge transferability, the optimal Ni/WO3 electrode exhibits outstanding catalytic activity toward hydrogen generation with a low overpotential of 163 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution and reduced cell voltage of 1.67 V when coupled with urea oxidation reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Ni sites in Ni/WO3 optimize the H adsorption energy (Delta G(H*)) with the |Delta G(H*)| value of 0.097 eV, much lower than that of Ni (0.35 eV) and WO3 (0.235 eV).

The fundamental understanding of the crystallinity transition of the components on both sides of the interface is extremely significant for realizing controllable construction of catalysts through interface engineering, but it still remains a challenge. Herein, the Ni/NiO heterogenous nanoparticles are successfully fabricated on the porous N-doped carbon spheres by a facile hydrothermal and subsequent pyrolysis strategy. And for the first time we show the experimental observation that the Ni/NiO interface can be fine-tuned via simply tailoring the heating rate during pyrolysis process, in which the crystalline/amorphous or crystalline/crystalline Ni/NiO heterostructure is deliberately constructed on the porous N-doped carbon spheres (named as CA-Ni/NiO@NCS or CC-Ni/NiO@NCS, respectively). By taking advantage of the unique porous architecture and the synergistic effect between crystalline Ni and amorphous NiO, the well-designed CA-Ni/NiO@NCS displays more remarkable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity than its crystalline/crystalline counterpart of CC-Ni/NiO@NCS. Particularly, the whole assembled two-electrode electrolytic cell using the elaborate CA-Ni/NiO@NCS both as the anode and cathode can realize the current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) at a super low voltage of 1.475 V (264 mV less than that of pure water electrolysis), as well as remarkable prolonged stability over 63 h.

Here, we present a photon-involved carbonylation of amines to synthesize ureas, achieving product yields of up to 99%, using Pd(OAc)2 and KI without losing the performance owing to the fast regeneration of Pd species under light irradiation. Reaction kinetics results and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra indicate the regeneration of the Pd species is realized by the light irradiation (below 450 nm) which induces the oxidation reaction between HI and O2 to produce I2, so that the active species PdI2 is regenerated through the reaction between Pd(0) and the I2.

Herein, ultrathin beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets with a porous structure were constructed to increase both the active surface area and the reactivity of active sites of catalysts, providing great opportunities for promoting the electrocatalytic UOR process. Theoretical investigations showed that the existence of abundant pores in ultrathin beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets could reduce the adsorption energy of urea molecules on the catalyst surface, thus leading to a highly efficient catalytic activity for the UOR. As expected, the porous beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets exhibit a large current density of up to 298 mA cm(-2) at 1.82 V (vs. RHE), which is roughly 18.1 times higher than that of the nonporous beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets and even comparable to those of other high-performance catalysts under similar conditions. This work not only provides a promising guideline for the development of advanced UOR catalysts, but also highlights the crucial role of the porous structure in promoting the electrocatalytic UOR process.

Herein, a facile solvothermal strategy for construction of Prussian-blue analogue (PBA) hollow cages with an open framework was developed. The as-obtained CoFe and NiFe hollow cages (CFHC and NFHC) can be directly utilized as electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with superior catalytic performance (lower electrolysis potential, faster reaction kinetics and long-term durability) compared to their parent solid precursors (CFC and NFC) and even the commercial noble metal-based catalyst. Impressively, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, the CFHC catalyst required an overpotential of merely 330 mV, 21.99% lower than that of the solid CFC precursor (423 mV) at the same condition. Meanwhile, the NFHC catalyst could deliver a current density as high as 100 mA cm(-2) for the urea oxidation electrolysis at a potential of only 1.40 V, 24.32% lower than that of the solid NFC precursor (1.85 V). This work provides a new platform to construct intricate hollow structures as promising nano-materials for the application in energy conversion and storage.

Phenylglyoxaldehyde-Functionalized Polymeric Sorbents for Urea Removal from Aqueous Solutions	ACS APPLIED POLYMER MATERIALS												For realization of a wearable artificial kidney based on regeneration of a small volume of dialysate, efficient urea removal from dialysate is a major challenge. Here a potentially suitable polymeric sorbent based on phenylglyoxaldehyde (PGA), able to covalently bind urea under physiological conditions, is described. Sorbent beads containing PGA groups were obtained by suspension polymerization of either styrene or vinylphenylethan-1-one (VPE), followed by modification of the aromatic groups of poly(styrene) and poly(VPE) into PGA. It was found that PGA-functionalized sorbent beads had maximum urea binding capacities of 1.4-2.2 mmol/g and removed similar to 0.6 mmol urea/g in 8 h at 37 degrees C under static conditions from urea enriched phosphate-buffered saline, conditions representative of dialysate regeneration. This means that the daily urea production of a dialysis patient can be removed with a few hundred grams of this sorbent which, is an important step forward in the development of a wearable artificial kidney.

Here, hollow NiCoP nanoprisms are derived from Prussian blue analogues by a combined self-template coordination reaction and gas-phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strong electron interaction, unique hollow nanostructure, and enhanced mass/charge transfer, NiCoP nanoprisms display outstanding alkaline HER and UOR performance. Specifically, low potentials of -0.052, -0.115, and -0.159 V for HER and ultralow potentials of 1.30, 1.36, and 1.42 V for UOR at current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) are obtained. Moreover, in a urea-assisted water electrolysis system, NiCoP nanoprisms only require cell voltages of 1.36, 1.49, and 1.57 V to offer current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), about 170, 180, and 200 mV less than the traditional water electrolysis. Theoretical calculations indicate the Co substitution in Ni2P promotes the adsorption and dissociation of water molecules, optimizes the desorption energy of active hydrogen atoms, and enhances the adsorption of urea molecules, thus accelerating the kinetics of HER and UOR. This work facilitates the application of hollow bimetallic phosphides in electrochemical preparation of clean energy and provides a successful paradigm for urea-rich wastewater electrolysis.

J	Glass, DE; Galvan, V; Prakash, GKS				Glass, Dean E.; Galvan, Vicente; Prakash, G. K. Surya			The Effect of Annealing Temperature on Nickel on Reduced Graphene Oxide Catalysts on Urea Electrooxidation	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												The annealing temperature effects on nickel on reduced graphene oxide (Ni/rGO) catalysts for urea electrooxidation were investigated. Nickel chloride was directly reduced in an aqueous solution of graphene oxide (GO) followed by annealing under argon at 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 degrees C, respectively. Xray Diffraction (XRD) patterns revealed an increase in the crystallite size of the nickel nanoparticles while the Raman spectra displayed an increase in the graphitic disorder of the reduced graphene oxide at higher annealing temperatures due to the removal of oxygen functional groups. The Ni/rGO catalysts annealed at higher temperatures displayed oxidized nickel surface characteristics from the Ni 2p X-ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) due to the oxidation of the nickel from the oxygen functional groups in the graphitic lattice. In the half-cell testing, the onset potential of urea electrooxidation decreased while the urea electrooxidation currents decreased as the annealing temperature was increased. The nickel catalyst annealed at 700 degrees C displayed a 31% decrease in peak power density while the catalyst annealed at 300 degrees C displayed a 13% increase compared with the unannealed Ni/rGO catalyst in the micro direct urea/ hydrogen peroxide fuel cells tests.

WD is a sustainable material that has been addressed as a promising alternative to synthetic soil corroborants. However, there is little information about the effect of WD on the nitrogen cycle. In this study, soils with different amounts of WD and with/without urea were tested for ammonium, urease, nitrate/nitrite, and potential nitrification activity at different points in a 30 day time frame. High concentrations of WD (1-2%) inhibited the hydrolysis of urea and the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate. Thermal desorption coupled to GC-MS and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry characterization allowed us to reveal that WD-urea interactions mainly involve lignin-derived compounds in the distillate, such as catechol, resorcinol, and syringol. This study provides the first evidence of a strong interaction between WD and urea in soil that could be used to develop slow-release fertilizers.

J	Choi, J; Chung, J				Choi, Jeongyun; Chung, Jinwook			Evaluation of urea removal by persulfate with UV irradiation in an ultrapure water production system	WATER RESEARCH												The removal of urea by persulfate with UV irradiation in an ultrapure water (UPW) production system was examined using a continuously operated column reactor. Urea is a substance that is not properly removed by the unit processes in UPW production systems. Based on our monitoring of urea concentration over 1 year of the operation of a UPW production facility, a relatively high concentration of urea was introduced between February and May in 2016 and the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the UPW was increased in that period. Approximately 50% of the urea in the raw water was removed by the UPW production process, for which double-pass reverse osmosis units were instrumental. The addition of persulfate to the TOC reduction UV unit in the UPW production process was examined to improve the efficiency of urea removal. As a result, supplying over 20 mu mol/L persulfate to the TOC reduction UV reactor improved the efficiency of urea removal from 9% to 90%. UV dose was an important factor of urea removal. In the ion analysis, nitrate and sulfate were detected in the effluent, and the ratio of produced nitrate to the removed urea was approximately 2.

Compared with water electrolysis, the introduction of urea not only improves the energy conversion efficiency of urea electrolysis but also makes this process apply in the treatment of sewage treatment. Herein, we highlight a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst of Co9S8 nanosheet arrays grown on carbon cloth with optimal nickel incorporation. Benefited from the incorporation of Ni, the electronic structure of Co9S8 is optimized, resulting in the enhanced electrical conductivity and charge transfer efficiency. The structure of nanosheets endows the 2D charge transfer pathway and exposes more active sites to achieve the robust electrocatalytic activity for overall urea electrolysis simultaneously. The optimal nickel incorporated Co9S8/carbon cloth catalysts display remarkable catalytic activity. It delivers the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with the potential of 1.28 V vs. RHE for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), almost rivalling the state-of-the-art UOR catalysts. Overall urea splitting based on Ni-Co9S8/carbon cloth as bifunctional catalyst is also carried out and only a potential of 1.52 V is required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome the sluggish kinetics, catalytically active sites should be rationally designed to maneuver the multiple key steps of intermediate adsorption and desorption. Herein, we demonstrate that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can provide an ideal platform for tailoring binary active sites to facilitate the rate-determining steps, achieving remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward UOR. Specifically, the MOF (namely, NiMn0.4-BDC) based on Ni/Mn sites and terephthalic acid (BDC) ligands exhibits a low voltage of 1.317 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). As a result, a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.15 s(-1) is achieved at a voltage of 1.4 V, which enables a urea degradation rate of 81.87% in 0.33 M urea solution. The combination of experimental characterization with theoretical calculation reveals that the Ni and Mn sites play synergistic roles in maneuvering the evolution of urea molecules and key reaction intermediates during the UOR, while the binary Ni/Mn sites in MOF offer the tunability for electronic structure and d-band center impacting on the intermediate evolution. This work provides important insights into active site design by leveraging MOF platform and represents a solid step toward highly efficient UOR with MOF-based electrocatalysts.

To attain a high urea electrolysis efficiency, highperformance electrocatalysts are highly required. Of late, transition metal (TM) chalcogenides-based materials are emerging as promising candidates for urea electrolysis. The catalytic performance of TM chalcogenides-based catalysts is optimized by tuning the internal/external characteristics, including nanostructure control, composition optimization, and heterostructuring. In this review, recent achievements in highefficiency electrocatalysts based on TM chalcogenides for urea electrolysis are critically discussed. First, the electrochemistry of urea electrolysis is analyzed. Next, recent progress in TM chalcogenides-based electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis is detailed. The electrocatalyst design strategies are particularly elucidated, as well as the catalyst structure-performance correlation. Ultimately, perspectives on crucial scientific issues in this booming field are highlighted.					wei, wei/HHR-8613-2022; Chen, Zhijie/W-1704-2019; Ni, Bing-Jie/ABB-5631-2021	Chen, Zhijie/0000-0003-0627-0856; Ni, Bing-Jie/0000-0002-1129-7837; Wei, Wei/0000-0001-5613-337X													2451-9103					FEB	2022	31								100888	10.1016/j.coelec.2021.100888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coelec.2021.100888													WOS:000779149300002

Herein, oxygen vacancy-rich cobalt hydroxide/aluminum oxyhydroxide heterostructure on nickel foam (denoted as Co(OH)2/AlOOH/NF-100) 2 /AlOOH/NF-100) has been fabricated using one step hydrothermal process. Theoretical calculation and experimental results indicate the electrons transfer from Co(OH)2 2 to highly active AlOOH results in the interfacial charge redistribution and optimization of electronic structure. Abundant oxygen vacancies in the heterostructure could improve the conductivity and simultaneously serve as the active sites for catalytic reaction. Consequently, the optimal Co(OH)2/AlOOH/NF-100 2 /AlOOH/NF-100 demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic performance for HER (62.9 mV@10 mA cm-2 ) and UOR (1.36 V@10 mA cm-2 ) due to the synergy between heterointerface and oxygen vacancies. Additionally, the in situ electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) for UOR suggests that the heterostructured catalyst exhibits rapid reaction kinetics, mass transfer and current response. Importantly, the urea-assisted electrolysis composed of the Co(OH)2/AlOOH/NF-100 2 /AlOOH/NF-100 manifests a low cell voltage (1.48 V @ 10 mA cm-2 ) in 1 M KOH containing 0.5 M urea. This work presents a promising avenue to the development of HER/UOR bifunctional electrocatalysts.

However, their UOR activity and stability are severely enslaved by the inevitable Ni group self-oxidation phenomenon. In this study, the glassy state NiFe LDH with uniform Cu dopant (Cu-NiFe LDH) by a simple sol-gel strategy is successfully synthesized. When served as the UOR catalyst, Cu-NiFe LDH required a 123 mV lower potential for UOR at both 10 and 100 mA cm-2 in comparison with the conventional anodic OER. It can also operate steadily for more than 300 h at 10 mA cm-2. The in-depth investigation reveals that Cu incorporation can optimize the local electronic structure of Ni species to induce high-valent Ni sites. The high-valent Ni sites would act as the active center during the proposed energetically favorable UOR route, which directly reacts on the high-valent Ni sites without self-oxidation inducing the formation of NiOOH species, resulting in a boosted electrocatalytic UOR activity and stability. The Cu dopant regulates the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of high-valent Ni sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the UOR kinetics. image					Li, Zi-Jian/O-7703-2019; Jang, Haeseong/GSD-9202-2022; Kim, Min/D-8949-2013; Li, Qichang/JDM-4930-2023	LI, Zijian/0000-0002-3107-0568													1614-6832	1614-6840				NOV	2024	14	41								10.1002/aenm.202403004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202403004		AUG 2024											WOS:001292131700001

Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalyst with CoNiP nanosheet coating on P-doped MoO2 nanorods (P-MoO2@CoNiP) is obtained via a two-step hydrothermal followed a phosphorization process. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional alkaline HER performance due to the formation of MoO2 and the dissolution/absorption of Mo. Meanwhile, the inclusion of Co and P in the P-MoO2@CoNiP catalyst facilitated the formation of NiOOH, enhancing UOR performance. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (Delta GH*) of P-MoO2@CoNiP is closer to 0 eV than CoNiP, favoring the HER. The catalyst only needs -0.08 and 1.38 V to reach 100 mA cm- 2 for catalyzing the HER and UOR, respectively. The full urea electrolysis system driven by P-MoO2@CoNiP requires 1.51 V to achieve 100 mA cm- 2, 120 mV lower than the traditional water electrolysis.

However, the kinetics of UOR is sluggish and thereby the fabrication of UOR catalyst which also possesses cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance is ascribed to be the paramount bottleneck due to the hard simultaneous satisfaction between UOR and HER performance metrics. Herein, a hierarchical amorphous-crystalline heterogeneous NiCoSx nanosheet with rich lattice defects grown on nickel foam (NiCoSx/NF) catalyst was proposed via scalable solvothermal method for overall urea-assisted water electrolysis. The NiCoSx/NF only needs an ultralow potential of 1.36 V to drive 100 mA cm- 2 for UOR, exceeding that of OER for 220 mV, and an overpotential of 183 mV to obtain 100 mA cm- 2 for HER. More importantly, the urea electrolyzer assembled with NiCoSx/NF as both cathode and anode could achieve 10, 100, and 500 mA cm- 2 at battery voltages of 1.41 V, 1.55 V, and 1.75 V, respectively, with continuous working for 60 h. Experimental and density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong electronic interactions caused by heterojunctions and lattice defects exposed on the well-accessible NF surface result in the increased proportions of Ni3+ active sites and enhanced conductivity, which should be responsible for the superior UOR and HER performance.

Electrochemical and SEIRAS studies of urea and biuret adsorption on polycrystalline gold	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The potential dependent adsorption of urea and its self-condensation product, biuret, have been studied on polycrystalline gold electrodes using electrochemical and in situ infrared spectroscopy. Voltammetry reveals that biuret displays a wider double-layer region compared to its parent compound and can only be oxidized at potentials that overlap with Au oxidation. Chronocoulometric measurements indicate that the adsorption of biuret is stronger than that of urea and the surface coverage is potential dependent. Surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) experiments have been performed on both urea and biuret adsorption from neutral solutions made from heavy water. Urea provides low intensity IR signals consistent with relatively weak adsorption over a very restricted potential domain whereas biuret is spectroscopically much more pronounced. Analysis of the SEIRAS results support at least two distinct configurations of adsorbed biuret involving oxygen coordination to the metal surface. At the limit of the positive potentials studied spectroscopic evidence of the adsorption of partially oxidized biuret (ureayl-type species) is provided.

However, less attention has been drawn to the subsequent generation of other combined chlorine species such as chloramines. In this work, the electrogeneration of chloramines has been assessed in different water matrices containing NHCl4, urea or synthetic urine. The yield of chloramines has been followed in-situ by differential electrochemistry mass spectroscopy (DEMS) during electrochemical advanced oxidation process with boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes. Furthermore, the influence of several variables such as chloride concentration, pH or organics concentration on the different distribution of inorganic monochloramine, dichloramine and trichloramine released as products has been considered.

Nowadays, searching for a harmless direct urea synthesis catalyst to electrochemically co-reduce N2 and CO2 gas for green urea synthesis under environmental conditions and avoiding the traditional ammonia synthesis pathway is a challenging research area. Here, a density functional theory (DFT) study was performed to investigate the catalytic activity of bimetallic doped graphite carbon nitride electrocatalysts (M2@g-C6N6, M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W) for the urea synthesis by reducing N2 and CO2 (NCR). The preference of CO2 adsorption and the coadsorption of CO and N2, which then the key intermediate *NCON is generated through the C-N coupling process. Three possible limiting steps are revealed, then the surface oxidation or hydroxylation and the competitive side reactions of NRR and HER were compared. The calculated results indicate that Ta2@g-C6N6 could be one of most promising catalysts for electrocatalytic NCR activity with limiting potentials of -1.01 V, which could effectively restrict surface oxidation or hydroxylation and suppress the competitive side reactions of the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

J	Upadhyay, P; Chakma, S				Upadhyay, Prachi; Chakma, Sankar			Physical insight into the enhanced urea electrooxidation using Ni and Fe-based LDH, LDO, and hydroxides under different dissolved gas saturation conditions in electrolyte	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY												The production of green hydrogen is one of the most demanding and challenging for modern technology. A promising and an effective approach is electrocatalytic anodic urea oxidation reaction to generate hydrogen at cathode under alkaline electrolysis condition. However, it remains crucial for the development of active and stable electrocatalysts for efficient urea oxidation. In this study, we employed the hydrothermal synthesis route for NiFe LDH, NiFe LDO, and Ni(OH)(2). The superior performance of NiFe LDH compared to other catalysts is observed due to easy charge transfer facilitated by Fe ions. Moreover, Fe incorporation prevents surface poisoning of the electrocatalyst, resulting in increased activity and stability for electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction. The influence of different electrolyte environments on the performance of urea-based electrolyzers for sustainable hydrogen production and management of urea-rich wastewater has been measured for the first time by varying oxygen saturation and nitrogen purging conditions. In cyclic voltammetry studies, O-2-saturated and purging conditions outperformed N-2 gas saturation or purging. The findings of this study provide valuable insight into the design of practical and environmentally friendly urea electrooxidation systems.

However, the lack of efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) electrocatalysts and suitable electron acceptors remains a challenge for practical applications. Here, we developed a DUFC system using Ni2P@Ni foam as the anode and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as the chemical oxidizers. The Ni2P@Ni foam anode showed a high oxidation activity for UOR with an onset potential of 0.30 V vs. Ag/AgCl and Tafel slope of 34.4 mV/dec. PMS with high theoretical potential improved the cell voltage to 1.43 V. A power density of DUFC up to 4.91 mW/cm(2) was achieved using PMS at room temperature, which was approximately twice as high as using H2O2 (2.38 mW/cm(2)). NiII/NiIII was the redox active species on the Ni2P anode in the DUFC process, and NiII was electrochemically oxidized to NiIII, which reverted to NiII by urea reduction. When real human urine was used as the fuel, a power density of 4.46 mW/cm(2) can be achieved at room temperature. This DUFC with high cell performance showed potential application in urea wastewater treatment. (C) 2021 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Herein, we propose an exhaustive denitrification method for urea via the oxidation of amine/ammonia-N with chlorine oxide radical, which induced from a bi-functional RuO2//WO3 anode, and the highly selective reduction of nitrate-N on cathode in photoelectrochemical cell (PEC). Under illumination, the WO3 photoanode side promotes the quantities hydroxyl and reactive chlorine radical, and these radicals are immediately combined to stronger chlorine oxide radical by RuO(2 )side, which obviously enhances the efficiency and speed of the urea oxidation. Synchronously, the over-oxidized nitrate can be selectively reduced by Pd and Au nanoparticles on the surface of cathode. Eventually, exhaustive denitrification is realized by the circulative reaction. Experimental observations and theoretical calculation revealed that chlorine oxide radical promoted significant denitrification of urea with an efficiency of 99.74% in 60 min under the optimum condition. The removal rate constant of the RuO2//WO3 anode was 3.08 times than that of single WO3 anode and 2.64 times than that of single RuO2 anode, confirming the chlorine oxide radical had stronger ability on denitrification than reactive chlorine radical. Also, the bi-functional anode contributed to best current efficiencies, utilizing the energy availably. This work proposes a promising method of exhaustive denitrification for urea.

Urea electrolysis has great prospects for wastewater treatment and purification, and is an efficient way to produce hydrogen energy. In this work, we fabricated the Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays on nickel foam through two-step facile hydrothermal method, and discovered that Fe doped Ni3S2 with Ni/Fe = 0.25:0.75 ((Ni0.25Fe0.75)(3)S-2/NF) presented a highly efficient performance and durability for both hydrogen evolution reaction and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). More notably, (Ni0.25Fe0.75)(3)S-2/NF only requires a voltage of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall urea splitting, and has excellent electrochemical stability for more than 100 h. The remarkable electrocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the Fe doping which modifies the coordination environment of Ni and optimizes the binding strength of UOR intermediates on Ni active sites. Furthermore, density functional theory calculation manifests that Fe-doped Ni3S2 exhibits higher intrinsic activity for lower Gibbs free energy in comparison with that of pristine Ni3S2. The present results demonstrate that nickel-based materials have great potential for urea electrolysis, providing significant insights into the preparation of nonexpensive transition metal electrocatalysts.

In a three -electrode cell, it was found that an oxide/metal bilayer outperforms single metal or oxide layer configurations for the urea electro-oxidation. It is also found that the incorporation of Fe within the Ni structure stabilizes the electrodes likely because it produces a decrease in the surface poisoning of the electrocatalyst. The improved performance observed for the oxide/metal bilayer configuration has been attributed to a synergetic effect between the active (oxy)hydroxide Ni-Fe catalytic species at the outer layers and a high electrical conductivity through the underlying metallic layer. The bilayer electrocatalyst tested in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser showed an overpotential decrease of 0.13 V when comparing urea oxidation vs. pure water electrolysis.

An environment-friendly reducing agent, glucose, was used for the synthesis of Cu2O NPs onto the surface of g-C3N4 without using any surfactant or additives. The surface composition, crystalline structure, morphology, as well as other properties have been investigated using XPS, XRD, SEM, FTIR, FESEM, EDS, etc. The electrochemical measurements of the prepared materials demonstrated that Cu2O exhibited a weak oxidation activity towards urea, while g-C3N4 has no activity towards urea oxidation. The Cu2O supported on the surface of g-C3N4 (Cu2O-g-C3N4) demonstrated a significant activity towards urea oxidation that reached two times that of the unsupported one. The significant increase in the performance was related to the synergetic effect between the Cu2O and gC(3)N(4) support.

However, the overoxidation of urea to NOx- usually dominates over its oxidation to N-2 at Ni(OH)(2)-based anodes. Furthermore, detailed reaction mechanisms of UOR remain unclear, hindering the rational catalyst design. We found that UOR to NOx- on Ni(OH)(2) is accompanied by the formation of near stoichiometric amount of cyanate (NCO-), which enabled the elucidation of UOR mechanisms. Based on our experimental and computational findings, we show that the formation of NOx- and N-2 follows two distinct vacancy-dependent pathways. We also demonstrate that the reaction selectivity can be steered towards N-2 formation by altering the composition of the catalyst, e.g., doping the catalyst with copper (Ni0.8Cu0.2(OH)(2)) increases the faradaic efficiency of N-2 from 30 % to 55 %.

The catalytic performances of urea electro-oxidation in an alkaline medium are investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. In order to minimize the effect of morphological variation by the Pd-Ni composition, the island structure with a uniform size or electrochemical surface area was prepared. The Pd-Ni/C electrode shows a much higher electrocatalytic activity and lower onset oxidation potential toward urea electro-oxidation compared to the Ag-Ni/C and Pt-Ni/C electrodes prepared by the same procedure. When the DUFC with a cell configuration of Pd-Ni/C anode and Pd/C cathode operates at room temperature, an open circuit voltage of 0.59 V was obtained with 0.33 molL(-1) urea solution as anolyte and humidification oxygen as the catholyte. The DUFC also exhibits a maximum power density of 1.12 mWcm(-2). The electrocatalytic activity by the developed solid solution is largely attributed to high intrinsic electronic conductivity, excellent porous network structures and a synergetic effect by the constituting bimetallic elements.

Because the performance of electrocatalysts is dependent on their structural, morphological, and electronic properties, herein, the tuning of these properties of Fe 3 O 4 @Ni-Foam via phosphorylation and sulfurization, yielding iron phosphide (FeP@Ni-Foam) and iron sulphide (FeS@Ni-Foam), with nanoneedles (along with microstructures) and nanoflower-like morphologies, respectively, is investigated. Among all the prepared samples, FeP is found to be the most effective electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution process (OER), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and seawater electrolysis. The overpotentials observed for OER, UOR, and seawater splitting are significantly reduced when using FeP as compared to other materials, with values of 207 mV, 133 mV, and 287.1 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm 2 . The enhanced catalytic activity of FeP over FeS and Fe 3 O 4 is attributed to morphological changes, improved electronic conductivity, and exceptional endurance. The theoretical studies reveal that FeP has a better density of states over the fermi level than FeS and Fe 3 O 4 , lowering the energy barriers for the OER and UOR processes and demonstrating significant catalytic activity towards these processes. This work demonstrates that phosphorylation and sulfurization treatments can alter morphologies and electrical characteristics, hence improving the catalytic activity of the materials.

Herein, Ni -P nanosheets are synthesized using a chemical nickel-plating technique and applied to the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The reaction time, plating solution pH, and reaction temperature play crucial roles in facilitating UOR kinetics. The optimized Ni -P nanosheets display good catalytic performance and the voltage difference between the 9000th and the first cycle is only 28 mV at 10 mA cm -2. Additionally, it maintains outstanding long-term stability at 1.52 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for 70 hours and Ni -P nanosheets deactivates by less than 1% compared to the initial current density, further confirming the high stability of Ni -P nanosheets for the UOR.

However, developing high-performance UOR/HER electrocatalysts in seawater instead of pure water remains a great challenge. Herein, (B,P,Co,Fe)-Ni anchored on Paulownia Wood (PW) is proposed to enhance the overall urea-(sea)water splitting performance. The resulting sample only needs a potential of 1.34 V to deliver a large current density of 100 mA cm-2 for alkaline UOR and features a remarkable durability to maintain 100 mA cm-2 for 100 h. The HER and UOR (HER||UOR) coupled system in alkaline seawater-urea electrolyte for producing H2 demonstrated a more significantly reduced electrolyzer voltage of 1.67 V obtained at 100 mA cm-2 in comparison to that of the HER||OER system (1.98 V). The well-aligned micro-channels and nanopores in wood frameworks not only improve the hydrophilicity and aerophobicity of the whole electrode, which is conducive to the penetration of the electrolyte and release of bubbles, but also shorten the transmission distance of ions and intermediates to accelerate the reaction kinetic process. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Co, Fe, P and B co-doping in Ni effectively adjusts the electronic structure, and the adsorption/desorption behavior of the urea reaction intermediates is regulated by the synergistic effect from multiple components, resulting in an excellent catalytic activity in seawater-urea media. This work promotes a better understanding of the surface electronic structure modulation of nanowood via doping strategy and offers great potential in the design of advanced UOR/HER catalysts for hydrogen production and urea wastewater treatment.

The formation of nitrogen-doped spherical carbon shell with ordered mesoporous structure prevented the structural damage of catalyst cores and allowed the migration and diffusion of electrolyte into the hollow carbon spheres. An ultra-thin layer of CE-NiFe nanoparticles could be tightly attached to the three-dimensional macroporous nickel foam (NF) by electrophoretic deposition. The CE-NiFe nanoparticles could lower the onset potential and increase the current density in anodic urea electrolysis and cathodic hydrogen production as compared with bare NE Macroporous NF substrate was very useful for the urea electrolysis and hydrogen production, which allowed for fast transport of electron, electrolyte, and gas products. The superior electrocatalytic ability of CE-NiFe/NF electrode in urea oxidation and water reduction made it favorable for versatile applications such as water treatment, hydrogen generation, and fuel cells.

One topic that has not been explored in depth in this regard is anodic reaction. Herein, the behavior of aluminum during anodic dissolution in AlCl3/urea (1.3:1) ILA was studied. The results revealed that during the anodic oxidation process, AlCl-4 ions decreased, Al2Cl-7 and Al3Cl-10 ions increased, and an AlCl3 passivation film was generated at electrode surface. Corrosion current density (icorr) increased and polarization resistance (RP) decreased as temperature rose.

Porous phosphorized CoNi2S4 yolk-shell spheres (P-CoNi2S4 YSSs) were rationally designed and synthesized by a combined hydrothermal sulfidation and gas-phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strengthened Ni3+/Ni2+ couple, enhanced electronic conductivity, and hollow structure, the P-CoNi2S4 YSSs exhibit excellent activity and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solution, affording low potentials of -0.135 V, 1.512 V, and 1.306 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, when used as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the P-CoNi2S4 catalyst merely requires a cell voltage of 1.544 V in water splitting and 1.402 V in urea electrolysis to attain 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent durability for 100 h, outperforming most of the reported nickel-based sulfides and even noble-metal-based electrocatalysts.

Herein, we report a versatile and simple strategy to synthesize ultrathin nanosheets of nickel-cobalt bimetallic hydroxides (named as NiCo BMHs) through NaBH4 boosted cyanogel hydrolysis strategy. The hydrogen (H-2) bubbles from the NaBH4 decomposition can effectively separate the 2D NiCo BMHs and avoid their self-stacking during the synthesis. As a result, NiCo BMHs with rich nanoholes possess only about 1.5 nm thickness, which results in a high surface area and rich defective atoms. The high surface area, rich edge active atoms, and synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Co2+/ Co3+ species greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity of NiCo BMHs towards urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The potential of UOR at NiCo BMHs is only 1.33 V at 10 mA cm(-2), much lower than that at various reported Ni-based nanomaterials, confirming the high electroactivity of NiCo BMHs.

The obtained NF/NiMoO4-S possesses pompon-like morphology and abundant pores, significantly different from its precursor. Precisely due to this multi-phase, multi-interface, and highly opened porous structure, NF/NiMoO4-S exhibits outstanding electrochemical per-formance in terms of superior activity and selectivity, appropriate kinetics, high charge transfer efficiency and robust durability. In urea media, NF/NiMoO4-S requires a low HER overpotential of 73 mV (10 mA cm-2) and a small potential of 1.382 V for UOR (50 mA cm-2) respectively. When assembled into a whole-cell electrolyzer, the voltage (50 mA cm-2) is 1.55 V, much lower than that of water electrolyzer. Attractively, in the human-urine medium, no significant activity degradation was observed on NF/NiMoO4-S.

In this work, Co8FeS8@CoFe-MOF/NF heterojunction arrays were fabricated by embedding sulfides into the surface of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) nanosheets as multifunctional electrocatalyst.

The electrodes were placed in a sodium hydroxide solution that is taken as a reference, against which chronopotentiometric measurements were taken for various concentrations of urea in the solution (from 0.05 to 0.7 M). The results show that the prepared photoanode exhibited high photcatalytic activity towards urea oxidation where 80% more photocurrent generated in case of 0.07 M urea compared to that obtained in case of the base solution and thus the 0.07 M is the optimum urea concentration for the application in hand.

However, since urea concentration in reclaimed water is higher than that in tap water, UPW production has not been efficient. To resolve this problem, this study aims to develop a new spent coffee grounds based biochar (SCG-BC)/persulfate catalytic system as a pretreatment unit. The objective is to enhance urea removal from reclaimed water so that UPW production is more effective. In this study, the biochar used was prepared from spent coffee grounds with detailed characterization. Results strongly suggested that the urea removed by SCG-BC/persulfate catalytic system was very encouraging (up to 73%). The best possible dosages for SCG-BC and persulfate for urea removal were 0.2 and 2.0 g L-1, respectively. Furthermore, this system could remove urea effectively in a wide range of pH (3-10). Moreover, the characterizations of SCG-BC (graphite C, defective edges and functional groups, i.e. -OH, C=O, carboxyl C-O) helped to activate persulfate in the catalytic process. OH center dot and SO4 center dot - were all involved in this process, while the SO4 center dot - was the main radical for urea degradation.

This study investigated the operating conditions of direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) with commercial catalysts to achieve maximum performance and to accumulate knowledge regarding the electrochemical environment of DUFC full-cell membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). The cell performance was optimized by experimentally varying the operating conditions (activation process, cell temperature, and reactant concentration) and anode parameters (ionomer ratio and catalyst loading mount). The results were evaluated by comparing the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and maximum power density obtained from the polarization curve. Additionally, the features of MEAs in DUFCs were explored from the viewpoint of performance improvement for the anion exchange membrane (AEM), supply of the liquid anode, and thickness of the bulky catalyst layer, which all have a comprehensive effect on cell performance. The best performance was realized when the single-cell was operated under 0.3 M urea in 1.0 M KOH at 50. using a KOH pretreatment membrane, and the cell exhibited the highest maximum power density of 57.18 mW cm(-2), To the best of our knowledge, the MEA with the optimum conditions introduced showed the best performance among the DUFCs. This suggests that scientific understanding and analysis of the optimal operating conditions have considerable potential for the development of new catalysts and MEA materials.

This study expands the commerciality of DUHP-FC by removing precious metals from their design. Nickel nanorod/nickel foam (NNR/NF) was fabricated using hydrothermal treatment to be used as the anode, and Prussian blue coating was deposited by potentiostatic electrodeposition onto hydrophilic carbon felt at the cathode (PB/CF). The anode exhibited a 7-folds higher current density than bare NF at 0-2 M urea, and lower charge transfer resistance. The cathode reported a high H2O2 reduction current. In addition, fuel cell tests indicated current density dependency on H2O2 concentration and cell voltage dependency on KCl concentration. A competitive maximum power density of 10.6 mW cm(-2) was achieved at 0.98 open circuit voltage and 45 mA cm(-2) maximum current density, in 0.33 M urea vs 2 M KCl and 2 M H2O2, exclusively via diffusive mass transfer.

In addition, the deposited electrode at 10 mA.cm-2 demonstrated best UOR performance which needed only 1.323 V vs RHE at 10 mA. cm- 2, due to having high electrochemical active area, interfacial engineering, and the optimized interaction between the electrode and the electrolyte.

As a substrate, carbon paper exhibited better benchmark potential and current values compared with stainless steel and fluorine-doped tin oxide glass, which was attributed to its greater active surface area per electrode geometric area. CV analysis of synthetic urine showed that phosphate, creatinine, and gelatin (i.e., proteins) had the greatest negative effect on the electro-oxidation activity of urea, with decreases in peak current up to 80% compared to that of a urea-only solution. Further investigation of the binding mechanisms of the deleterious compounds using in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed that urea and phosphate weakly bind to NiCo(2)O(4 )through hydrogen bonding or long-range forces, whereas creatinine interacts strongly, forming deactivating inner-sphere complexes. Phosphate is presumed to disrupt the interaction between urea and NiCo(2)O(4 )by serving as a hydrogen-bond acceptor in place of catalyst sites. The weak binding of urea supports the hypothesis that it is oxidized through an indirect electron transfer. Outcomes of this study contribute to the development of electrolytic systems for treating source-separated urine.

Herein, the reconstruction with the formation of Ni2P and Mo2O72- on the surface can largely enhance the alkaline HER activity of P-NiMoO4 by on-site electrochemical activation strategy. Systematic experimental results indicate that the reconstruction process enables the exposure of additional Ni sites and the adjustment of hydrogen adsorption to facilitate HER kinetics. Ultimately, a highly efficient alkaline HER electrode with low overpotential of -48.9 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved. More importantly, a UOR electrolyzer assembled with A-P-NiMoO4 as the cathode and P-NiMoO4 as the anode exhibits impressive performance with a small cell voltage of 1.363 V for 10 mA cm(-2). The application of the fabricated electrodes in a practical cell driven by a commercial dry battery (1.5 V) demonstrates efficient and stable hydrogen production, making the developed strategy promising for the rational design of highly active electrocatalysts for green hydrogen production.

Herein, a carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT-COOH)-ferrocene carboxylic acid (Fc-COOH) modulated NiMOF hybrid material (MWCNT-NiMOF(Fc)) has been synthesized for dual electrocatalysis of the UOR and OER. The material characterization results indicated that MWCNT-COOH and Fc-COOH were integrated into the framework structure of the NiMOF. The direct interaction between the NiMOF and MWCNT/Fc facilitated electron transfer in the hybrid material and led to lattice strain, which improved the charge transfer kinetics, promoted the exposure of more unsaturated Ni sites, and increased the electrochemically active surface area. These factors together enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of MWCNT-NiMOF(Fc) towards the UOR and OER. Using a glassy carbon electrode as the substrate, MWCNT-NiMOF(Fc) exhibited low potential requirements, low Tafel slopes, and high stability. In overall urea and water splitting electrolysis cells, the excellent UOR and OER dual functional catalytic ability and enormous practical application potential of the MWCNT-NiMOF(Fc) modified foam nickel electrode were further demonstrated. On the basis of the above research, the influence of a KOH environment on urea electrolysis was further studied, and the urea electrolysis products were analyzed, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic performance of MWCNT-NiMOF(Fc) for urea oxidation. This study provides a new approach for developing high-performance NiMOF-based electrocatalysts for challenging bifunctional UOR/OER applications, and has potential application value in hydrogen production from urea-containing wastewater electrolysis. MWCNT-COOH and Fc-COOH were integrated into the framework structure of a NiMOF, altering its electronic structure and generating lattice strain. The resulting MWCNT-NiMOF(Fc) exhibited excellent UOR and OER dual functional catalytic activity.					曾, 庆圣/GSE-1731-2022; Xu, Liqiang/AGX-6674-2022	Wang, Xinxing/0000-0001-8337-9033													1477-9226	1477-9234				FEB 6	2024	53	6					2565	2574		10.1039/d3dt03456a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d3dt03456a		JAN 2024						38221875					WOS:001142173400001

We revealed the formation mechanism of urea nitrate and clarified the main and side reaction paths and key intermediates of denitrification. Urea nitrate would be separated from urea absorption solution only when the concentration product of [urea], [H+] and [NO3-] was greater than 0.87 similar to 1.22 mol(3)/L-3. The effects of the urea concentration (5-20%) and reaction temperature (30-70 degrees C) on the denitrification efficiency could be ignored. Improving the oxidation degree of the flue gas promoted the removal of nitrogen oxides. The alkaline condition was beneficial to the dissolution process, while the acidic condition was beneficial to the reaction process. As a whole, the alkaline condition was the preferred process parameter. The research results could guide the optimization of process conditions in theory, improve the operation efficiency of the denitrification reactor and avoid the occurrence of side reactions.					ye, peng/LWI-6154-2024; Gan, Lin/GSN-4603-2022; Li, Kezhi/M-6231-2017	Li, Kezhi/0000-0002-7783-0673														1420-3049				JAN	2023	28	1							162	10.3390/molecules28010162	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules28010162								36615356					WOS:000908715600001

In this work, nickel oxide-molybdenum trioxide (NiO-MoO3) nanocomposite as a non-enzymatic sensor for glucose and urea oxidation is synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The nanocomposite synthesis is demonstrated using XRD, Raman, SEM, and TEM techniques. The electrochemical activity of the developed sensor is determined by cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, impedance spectroscopic, and chronoamperometry. The detection limit of NiO-MoO3 nanocomposite is found to be 0.86 and 0.85 mu M for urea and glucose, respectively. From the chronoamperometry test, this sensor maintains 66% and 65% of the initial current for urea and glucose, respectively, representing excellent stability.

Thus, the replacement of OER with more thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation (UOR) and methanol oxidation (MOR) reactions shows good promise. In this paper, a CeMo-Ni3S2/NF 3 S 2 /NF bifunctional electrocatalyst for UOR and MOR electrolysis was prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. The experiments reveal that the doped Ce and Mo cations significant modulate the morphology of Ni3S2, 3 S 2 , and thus significant boost the electrochemically active surface area and increase the UOR and MOR performance. At a current density of 100 mA cm-2 , UOR requires a potential of 1.35 V (vs. RHE) and MOR requires 1.38 V (vs. RHE), which are both significantly lower than the potential of 1.59 V (vs. RHE) required for OER. The UOR reaction produces NO 2 - with a Faradaic efficiency of 69.0 %, while the MOR reaction produces formate with a Faradaic efficiency of 81.5 %.

Highly Dispersed Core-Shell Ni@NiO Nanoparticles Embedded on Carbon-Nitrogen Nanotubes as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Enhancing Urea Oxidation Reaction	ENERGY & FUELS												Wastewater treatment and energy production are important fields of research to meet the current requirements of sustainable energy development and wastewater restoration. The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can be used for simultaneous environmental remediation and energy production on a priority basis. Nickel-nickel oxide (Ni@NiO) core-shell NPs on carbon-nitrogen nanotubes (CNNTBs) have been synthesized as electrocatalysts by using a simple and easy aerial annealing method. Morphological analysis by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) confirms the formation of Ni@NiO NPs on CNNTBs with an average size of similar to 40 nm. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms Ni@ NiOCN-X with a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. A BET surface area measurement suggests that annealing at 400 degrees C (Ni@NiOCN-4) creates a larger surface area than that of carbon-nitrogen material (CN). The electrochemical studies of the Ni@ NiOCN-4 nanocomposite reveal that it has a better electrochemical activity and ultralow onset potential with an Eonset = 0.42 VAg/AgCl and current density of 34 mA/cm2 for a potential of 0.71 VAg/AgCl toward urea oxidation reactions. The annealing temperature-dependent studies were found to be effective toward the morphology tunning and hence tunable catalytic performance toward urea oxidation reactions. In urea oxidation studies, chronoamperometry (i-t) and EIS analysis show that the proposed Ni@NiOCN-4 system has long-term stability and ultrafast electron transfer. This work showed a simple way for temperature-dependent morphology tuning of a catalyst with enhanced electrochemical activity for urea oxidation, which is useful for sustainable energy production utilizing urea-rich wastewater.

To this end, the present work demonstrates a facile synthetic route towards self-standing nanocubiods consisting of nickel-cobalt hexacyano frameworks, commonly known as Prussian blue (NC-PB)-analogue, anchored on carbon nanotubes (NC-PB@CNT) via an ion-exchange strategy. The overall water splitting performance of the NC-PB@CNT films was systematically investigated in an alkaline KOH electrolyte. The optimized NC-PB@CNT film is shown to provide an outstanding overall-water splitting performance with a low cell voltage of 1.66 Vat a rate of 50 mAcm(-2), along with an excellent long-term cell durability of more than 100 h. Furthermore, the addition of urea to the alkaline electrolyte is ascertained to decrease the cell voltage to 1.37 Vwith oxidation of urea at a rate of 50 mAcm(-2). The enhanced overall water splitting and urea oxidation (UOR) performance of the optimized NCPB@CNT electrode are assumed to arise from a synergistic effect between the carbon nanotubes and the framework structures, which enhances the catalytic active sites and provides a facile charge transport pathway between them.

Electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has gained attention as a promising alternative anode reaction to water oxidation due to its small theoretical oxidation potential. However, the application of UOR is confronted with great challenges due to the unsatisfactory current under a low potential. Herein, we developed a self-supported electrode, heterogeneous cobalt phosphide, and nickel phosphide-modified nickel-cobalt alloy nanotube arrays with nickel foam as skeleton support (CoP3-Ni2P-Co x Ni1-x NTAs/NF) to improve the UOR performance by optimizing the local charge distribution of active Ni sites. The CoP3-Ni2P-Co x Ni1-x NTAs/NF electrode exhibited excellent UOR activity with a low potential of 1.36 V (vs RHE) at 100 mA cm-2. Surface structure analysis and electrochemical in situ Raman results revealed that synchronous CoNi alloying and heterogeneous CoP3-Ni2P introduction boosted the formation of the active Ni3+-O species caused by the modulated surface electronic structure of Ni atoms, thus accelerating the interfacial electrocatalysis.

In this study, the chestnut leaves-derived biochars treated by the co-pyrolysis process with KOH/urea exhibited a favorable capability to catalyze the oxidation of SO2 in aqueous solution. The BK-N-8 biochar catalyst was the optimal one due to its moderate nitrogen content and appropriate surface functional groups. It exhibited a fast initial conversion rate from SO2 to SO42- (6.50 mu mol g-1 s-1), and an excellent cycling durability for the COS process. The material showed a catalytic activity that surpassed all the reported carbonaceous materials. The surface functionalities were revealed to be the decisive factor for the conversion rate and durability of catalytic capacity. The superiority of the BK-N-8 with pyridinic N-doped aromatic cluster (AC) was further investigated via density-functional-theory calculations. The epoxy groups from O2 dissociation at the edge sites of ACs played a pivotal role for COS process onto biochars. This study provides insightful information for an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of COS process catalyzed by carbonaceous materials.

J	Sriram, S; Nambi, IM; Chetty, R				Sriram, Saranya; Nambi, Indumathi M.; Chetty, Raghuram			Hexavalent chromium reduction through redox electrolytic cell with urea and cow urine as anolyte	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The present study demonstrates the potential utilization of urea/cow urine as anolyte for Cr(VI) reduction via a simple three-chambered electrolytic cell. The inherent chemical energy in the dual-waste stream (Cr(VI)-urea/ urine) is employed for its self-oxidation-reduction without the need for any external energy supply. Ni foam as electroactive anode and catalyst-free carbon felt as cathode, along with the appropriate positioning of ion-selective separators, indirectly improved the cell performance by impeding electrolyte crossover. A fundamental study involving five different membrane configurations was conducted herein to improve Cr(VI) reduction efficiency. The Cr(VI) reduction efficiencies were 11.84 +/- 0.27%, 10.55 +/- 0.17%, 77.24 +/- 0.38% at 24h, 13.57 +/- 0.25% at 72 h with glass frit, cation exchange membrane (CEM), sandwiched membrane, and anion exchange membrane (AEM) as separators in a dual-chambered H-cell, respectively, with an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 100 mg/L. The fifth configuration, consisting of a middle chamber between the anode and cathode with the CEM close to the anode and the AEM close to the cathode resulted in a reduction efficiency of 79.98 +/- 2.24% within 45 min for an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 400 mg/L. The first order rate constants were determined to be 0.024, 0.018, and 0.013 min(-1) for Cr(VI) concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, when urea was replaced with cow urine as anolyte, a reduction efficiency of 98.94 +/- 1.28% was achieved at pH 2 in 45 min with 400 mg/L as initial Cr(VI) concentration. Furthermore, the XPS spectra of reduced Cr corresponding to binding energies of 579.4 eV and 589.3 eV, respectively, confirmed the presence of low-toxic Cr(III). The effect of applied load, initial Cr(VI) and urea concentration, Cr(VI) reduction under different initial H2SO4 concentrations were succinctly investigated to evaluate the performance of the electrolytic cell. The redox electrolytic cell can thus be an alternative to the conventional chemical or energy intensive processes for the reduction of hexavalent chromium.

Herein, a novel hybrid electrocatalyst comprising fullerene quantum dot (FQD)-decorated CoNi layered double hydroxides (CoNi-LDH) nanosheet arrays anchored on porous Ni foam (NF) is elaborately fabricated. Beneficial from the synergetic effect between FQD and CoNi-LDH, the obtained FQD/CoNi-LDH/NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution as well as urea oxidation under ambient atmosphere. Impressively, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it requires cell voltages of only 1.59 and 1.45 V for overall water and urea electrolysis, respectively, in a two-electrode electrolyzer consisting of FQD/CoNi-LDH/NF as both anode and cathode. Furthermore, this catalyst also displays outstanding reaction kinetics and favorable catalytic stability. Both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that the charge transfer from FQD to CoNi-LDH could account for the excellent catalytic performance of the newly-synthesized catalyst, and the decorated FQD finely modulates the electronic structure of CoNi-LDH, favoring the adsorption of active hydrogen atom, and thus promote the catalytic process. The present work would provide useful guidance for designing and developing multifunctional and efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.

Herein, an amorphous and porous 2D NiFeCo hydroxide nanosheets grown on nickel foam (NF) (NiFeCo LDH/NF) by a cost-effective electrodeposition method was explored for efficient electrolytic water splitting and urea electrolysis. Experimental results show that porous confinement in 2D orientation, amorphous nature, and synergistic effect leads to the excellent catalytical performance of the as-prepared 2D NiFeCo LDH/NF electrode for overall water splitting and urea electrolysis. The NiFeCo LDH/NF electrode presents promising behavior for water electrolysis with a small overpotential of 210 mV and 108 mV, respectively, is required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to gain 10 mA cm(-2). More notably, the bifunctional NiFeCo LDH/NF catalyst, for water electrolysis, needs a lower potential of 1.57 V to gain 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 KOH. Furthermore, the electrochemical urea oxidation results show that NiFeCo LDH/NF requires just 0.280 V (vs SCE) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with a 0.33 M urea, whereas urea-mediated electrolysis cells require a very low potential of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The present results provide remarkable and notable insights into the preparation of non-noble and highly efficient 2D transition metal hydroxide electrocatalysts with performances that allow them to compete for widespread use in various applications.

J	Li, QK; Li, PL; Abbaspourrad, A				Li, Qike; Li, Peilong; Abbaspourrad, Alireza			Using urea-shifting to create a natural blue, antioxidant emulsifier from phycocyanin	FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS												Phycocyanin (PC) is an algae-derived blue protein that can serve as an antioxidant colorant and emulsifier. Urea was used as an emulsification aid by balancing PC's hydrophilic-lipophilic character and was removed by dialysis after emulsification processes. With increasing concentration, urea gradually dissociated and denatured the PC polymers. By using spectroscopic methods, the aromatic amino acids and chromophores appeared to fold inward, and the secondary helix structure devolved into the unordered structure. Structural changes caused the hydrophilic PC to become more hydrophobic, resulting in an increase of its emulsifying capacity with a concomitant cost to PC's natural blue color. The partially denatured PC increased the amount of PC surface adsorption at the O/W interface by 39.89% of adsorbing percentage and the O/W interfacial protein concentration was 1.56 mg m- 2, resulting in finer and more dispersed emulsion droplets. Therefore, although the denaturation resulted in a partial weakening of the protein's antioxidant properties (from 7.70 to 5.54 nmol L-1 Trolox equivalent), the stabilized droplets allowed the emulsions to exhibit higher apparent antioxidant properties (from 7.80 to 7.87 nmol L-1 Trolox equivalent). In the 37 degrees C storage stability evaluation, emulsions with lower starting urea concentrations remained blue longer, while those with higher starting urea concentrations remained more stable to long-term storage and showed lower oxidation levels. The urea concentration of 5 M was chosen because it maintained a relatively stronger blue color while keeping the emulsion more stable and protecting the oils from further oxidation.					li, qike/KVA-7764-2024	Li, Qike/0000-0002-8356-5087; Li, Peilong/0000-0003-4710-2824													0268-005X	1873-7137				OCT	2024	155								110203	10.1016/j.foodhyd.2024.110203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2024.110203		JUN 2024											WOS:001250566500001

The exploitation of inexpensive and highly active bifunctional catalyst still remains a considerable challenge. We report the hybrid nanosheet arrays constructed of MoNi4/NiO heterojunction with hierarchically crosslinked network architecture by hydrothermal reaction and subsequent annealing process under H2/Ar atmosphere. The special heterostructure with neoteric morphology can promote electron shift and interface interaction through the powerful coupling interface between MoNi4 and NiO, increasing charge transfer speed, intrinsic activity and electrolyte transport. Only 31 mV overpotential and 1.37 V potential are needed to arrive 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR, respectively. For the two-electrode urea-assisted electrolyzer, the lower potential of 1.41 V is required to reach 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, it displays superior stability with unceasing working for 54 h at the cell voltage of 1.41 V without obvious activity degeneration. This research provides an insight on the construct of high-efficiently bifunctional catalyst by synergistic coupling of NiMo-based alloys with metal oxides.

The adsorption and subsequent dissociative reaction of hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases on the alpha-Fe2O3 (111) nanowires were investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) method. The average adsorption energy is -4.12 kcal/mole at different sites. The adsorption of gases resulted in a difference in density and net spin of electrons from 68 to 120 and 0-21 respectively. In addition, it induces magnetic moment value of 36.33 mu B, which confirms the enhanced magnetic behaviour of hematite. alpha-Fe2O3 nanowires (NWs) synthesized by heating iron wire in a box furnace at (750-800) degrees C and as synthesized alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) were received to use as a catalyst in the magnetic reaction of urea synthesis. X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) confirms the peaks of rhombohedral structure of alpha- Fe2O3 and Raman spectrum analyses confirms the alpha- Fe2O3 peaks at 410 cm(-1), 500 cm(-1) and 616 cm(-1). The needle-like shape of hematite nanowires with length ranging from 16-25) mu m and diameter from 74 to 145 nm confirmed by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The magnetic properties of the nanowires exhibited different levels of saturation magnetization, for alpha- Fe2O3 perpendicularly aligned direction (13.18 emu/g) and random direction (10.73 emu/ g). Urea synthesis was done under magnetic field ranges from 0.0 to 2.5 T. The activation energy of alpha-Fe2O3 NWs for urea production is lower than NPs in the range of 0-1 T, whereas it is reversed for higher magnetic induction values. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the formation of urea at the peaks of 1690-1600 cm(-1). This green urea employing magnetically induced method could be a contender to the Haber-Bosch process currently used by the current industry which utilizes high temperature and high pressure.

In this study, novel MOF-derived nickel nitride on nickel foam catalysts were successfully synthesized at different temperatures (300, 350, 400 degrees C) (denoted as C-T, T = 300, 350, 400). C-350 was demonstrated to be a highly active and durable 3D catalyst toward urea oxidation reaction (UOR), with a required potential of 1.337 V at 10 mA/cm(2). At the same time, C-350 has higher catalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) than other materials with a low overpotential of 47 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). Furthermore, its two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer only needs a voltage of 1.503 V to obtain 100 mA/cm(2), which is 0.160 V lower than that of pure water splitting. Also, the current density can be maintained for at least 24 h, showing its potential for practical applications.

Fe(EDTA)-Ni3S2 @NF electrode is prepared by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The addition of EDTA promotes more Fe atoms doping into Ni3S2. Fe doping regulated the morphology and electronic structure of Ni3S2, and the Fe(EDTA)-Ni3S2 @NF shows excellent UOR activity. The required UOR potentials on Fe(EDTA)-Ni3S2 @NF at 50 mA cm(-2) is 1.363 V (vs. RHE). In addition, the kinetics experiments and DFT calculations of the electrode toward UOR are carried out. It is found that UOR reactions under high current density (760 mA cm(-2)) would be limited. The liquid product of NO2- were detected by ion chromatography for UOR on Fe(EDTA)-Ni3S2 @NF.

However, it is a challenge to enhance the amount of high-valence transition metal for ensuring Ni3+-rich specie in nickel sulfides. In this work, one-pot urea-assisted synthesis method was applied to fabricate Ni3+-rich W,V co-modified nickel sulfide nanohorn arrays grown on nickel foam (W, V-NiS@NF-UR1) as OER electrocatalyst in alkaline media. Urea can not only improve the crystallinity of electrocatalysts but also regulate their composition, which is favorable for the formation of the high content of W6+ species in the electrocatalyst, consequently increasing the Ni3+ active sites and enhancing the electrocatalytic OER performance. As a result, a small overpotential of 214 mV is required for a current density of 10 mA cm-2 by the as-prepared W, V-NiS@NF-UR1 electrocatalyst and a small Tafel slope of 69 mV dec � 1 is observed in 1 M KOH. Meanwhile, the introduction of V species is also beneficial to keeping the high-valence W6+ in the electrocatalyst during the sulfurization process. For comparison, the counterpart electrocatalysts were also investigated systematically without urea.

Therefore, it is of great importance to devise and synthesize new bifunctional electrocatalysts for both UOR and HER. Herein, a novel nickel metal-organic framework (Ni-bza, Hbza = 4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) benzoic acid) was constructed by a solvothermal method, followed by the study of the Ni-bza-derived electrocatalyst Ni-bza-T for UOR and HER applications; we found that Ni-bza-900 shows more excellent performance in both UOR and HER. For UOR, at a current density of 10 mA & BULL;cm-2, the overpotential can reach 1.38 V, and it needs a potential of 306 mV to achieve the same current density for HER. Ni-bza-900 has smaller Tafel slopes of 176.8 and 183.43 mV & BULL;dec-1 in UOR and HER, respectively. Besides, Ni-bza-900 has a larger Cdl value, indicating a larger active area.

However, the sluggish six-electron transfer process of UOR significantly limits the reaction kinetics, thereby restricting the development of the aforementioned energy conversion techniques. Herein, we highlighted a high-performance UOR catalyst based on the hierarchical wire-on-sheet Ni(OH)(2) nanoarrays with optimal cerium doping and controllable phase regulation. The local Ni3+ species and the unique wire-on-sheet morphology of the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanoarray catalyst guarantee fast formation of high-valence species for UOR catalysis, and the Ce doping further optimizes the electronic structure, therefore resulting in greatly enhanced UOR behavior synergistically. This work may provide a universal structural optimization strategy for designing advanced UOR electrocatalysts.

By optimizing reaction influencing factors, the residual urea concentration reduced to 1.61mg/L over -MnO2, far below the effluent standard. Meanwhile, the temperature of heterogeneous hydrolysis over -MnO2 dropped drastically compared with that of thermal hydrolysis. Further, the kinetic parameters of hydrolysis were obtained over -MnO2.

Herein, ultrathin rhodium-doped nickel iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets are successfully synthesized, which exhibit outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER performance, and advanced overall water splitting. More impressively, the remarkable mass activity of 960 mA mg(-1) at 1.55 V (1.7 times larger than NiFe-LDH) for urea electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) shows the great potential to surmount the sluggish OER for overall water splitting. A urine-mediated electrolysis cell is subsequently configured, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a potential of 1.35 V, which is 105 mV lower than that of ureafree counterpart. The enhanced catalytic activity and cell performance are attributed to the introduction of Rh into NiFe-LDH matrix by changing the electronic structure, allowing optimization of the adsorbed species, as confirmed by experimental measurements and computational analyses.

The morphology, element distribution, crystal structure and catalyst content of as-prepared electrode were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometer(XRD) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer(ICP-MS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry and alternate current impedance methods were applied to investigate the single electrode's catalytic activity and the whole cell's output performance based on the Ni@MWCNTs anode. The results imply that the strongly-adsorbed intermediate possibly generates during urea electro-oxidation. When the concentration of KOH is 3.0 mol/L, the oxidation peak current density reaches the highest value of 18.7 mA.mg(-1).cm(-2). The direct urea fuel cell gives an open circuit voltage of 0.87 V and a peak power density of 1.74 mW/cm(2), indicating the superiority of Ni@MWCNTs anode and H2O2 oxidant.

Recently, some studies are turning to hydrogen production from seawater or wastewater, to save valuable freshwater resources and make waste profitable. Here, we fabricate one-dimensional SnO2@BiVO4 core-shell nanorod arrays decorated with cobalt-phosphate cocatalyst (1D SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs), which show efficient charge separation and transport properties due to the rational design of conducting core-layer and introduction of the cocatalyst. The as-obtained SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanodes exhibit largely enhanced PEC water oxidation performance: the maximum photocurrent density of 2.63 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE is 6.58 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 films (similar to 0.40 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the ternary photoanode exhibits promising PEC performance for urea oxidation, giving rise to a current density of 3.44 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE in a neutral urea electrolyte.

In this study, heterostructure nanocubes (NCs) comprising inner cobalt oxysulfide (CoOS) NCs and outer CoFe (CF) layered double hydroxide (LDH) are developed using a hydrothermal methodology. During the sulfidation process, the divalent sulfur ions (S2-) are released from the breakdown of the sulfur source and react with the Co-precursors on the surface leading to the transformation of CoOH nanorods into CoOS nanocubes. Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses reveal that the interactions at the interface of the CF@CoOS NCs significantly altered the electronic structure, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. The optimal catalysts exhibited effective OER and UOR activities, the attained potentials are 1.51 and 1.36 V. This remarkable performance is attributable to the induction of electron transfer from the CoFe LDH to CoOS, which reduces the energy barrier of the intermediates for the OER and UOR. Furthermore, an alkaline water and urea two-cell electrolyzer assembled using CF@CoOS-2 NCs and Pt/C as the anode and cathode requires a cell voltage of 1.63 and 1.56 V along with a durability performance. A CoFe-LDH and CoOS 3D nanocubes heterostructure is prepared via a hydrothermal route for effective electrocatalytic water and urea oxidation. During sulfidation process, the divalent sulfur ions react with Co-precursors and lead to the transformation of CoOH nanorods into CoOS nanocubes. The obtained heterostructure required a cell voltage of 1.63 and 1.56 V for overall water and urea-splitting alkaline electrolyzer.image					Han, Young-Kyu/MIJ-9756-2025; Shanmugam, Ranjith/J-7475-2019; Dong, Chung-Li/AGQ-7440-2022	Dharman, Ranjith Kumar/0000-0003-3325-0156													1613-6810	1613-6829				JUN	2024	20	26								10.1002/smll.202310112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202310112		JAN 2024						38221688					WOS:001142216600001

The electrocatalytic activity and ECL intensity of ABEI-AuNP-GONR/SPE were found to increase proportionally with the concentration of urea in the analyte sample, owing to the rise in pH value. These phenomena are attributed to increased formation of luminol monoanion precursors for further electrochemical oxidation, which in turn produce either luminol radicals or excited 3-amino-phthalate molecules. The luminescence is most likely caused by the interaction of luminol radicals with superoxide radicals formed from dissolved oxygen. The sensitivity of our sensor was determined to be 170.58mM(-1) and 16.23mM(-1) for urea concentrations from 2 to 5.82mM and from 5.82 to 30mM, respectively, covering the normal urea level in human blood.

Benefiting from the synergetic effects, the Fe-O-P/NF exhibits a low potential of 1.34 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 57.2 mV dec(-1) for UOR. Combined with the high HER activity of Fe-O-P/NF, the urea-based overall water splitting can be performed with an low voltage of 1.43 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, which is 200 mV lower than that for pure water splitting.					li, mengjie/GRS-3931-2022; Wang, Huanwen/H-1036-2017; Gong, YanSheng/C-9849-2011; Wang, Rui/B-8840-2012; He, Beibei/E-6435-2018	gong, yansheng/0000-0001-8197-9481; Li, Yuanjian/0000-0002-0356-3234; Wang, Rui/0000-0001-5403-1628; He, Beibei/0000-0001-6802-1519													0025-5408	1873-4227				APR	2018	100						72	75		10.1016/j.materresbull.2017.12.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.materresbull.2017.12.001													WOS:000424719500011

The structure, morphology, and surface composition of the electrocatalyst were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy, field emission transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic properties of the materials were studied by cyclic voltammetry, AC impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry. The results show that the Ni-based catalyst shows a significant improvement in urea electrooxidation after the introduction of CeO2. Compared with Ni/3DNG, the oxidation current density of the Ni-CeO2/3DNG catalyst is increased by a factor of two. The presence of CeO2 increases the content of nickel oxide on the surface of the catalyst and improves the pore structure and mass transfer of the catalyst. Therefore, the reaction mechanism of urea electrooxidation in the alkaline solution changes, increasing the activity of the catalyst.					zhang, qingqing/GXF-2381-2022														0947-7047	1862-0760				APR	2019	25	4					1943	1951		10.1007/s11581-019-02902-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11581-019-02902-z													WOS:000468282200049

Preparing heteroatomically doped and self-supported three-dimensional (3D) catalysts has become an efficient pathway to promote the electrochemical performance of catalysts. Recently, Cu-based complexes have been investigated as OER catalysts and exhibited improved catalytic activities. However, Cu-doped composites as UOR catalysts have been rarely reported, and the effect of Cu remains unclear in the UOR process. The present work exhibits a self-supported electrocatalyst of Cu-doped Ni3S2 nanosheets supported on Ni foam (NF) synthesized via a direct one-step hydrothermal sulfuration method and unlocks the effect of Cu on the relationship between the catalyst structure and UOR performance. The doping of the Cu element transformed the morphology of Ni3S2 from nanoparticles to nanosheets, increasing the active surface area. Meanwhile, the Cu dopant regulated the electronic structure of Cu-doped Ni3S2 by promoting electron transport from the Ni atom to the Cu dopant, stimulating the formation of active Ni sites with a high valency during UOR. Moreover, the doping of the Cu element optimized the Gibbs adsorption energies of the pivotal intermediates during urea oxidation. Remarkably, as-prepared Cu-doped Ni3S2/NF required only 1.30 V vs RHE toward UOR and an overpotential of 188 mV toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with outstanding electrochemical durability. Besides, the overall urea electrolyzer constructed using Cu-doped Ni3S2/NF as the UOR and HER catalyst needed only 1.57 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with stable durability during a long-term test. The present research offers novel insights into the research for designing and preparing efficient and durable electrodes in urea oxidation applications.

In this work, a Ni-Fe Prussian blue analogue is grown on MOF-Ni by two steps. First, carnation-shaped MOF-Ni is directly grown on the nickel foam. Second, nanocube-like Prussian blue analogue is grown on a MOF-Ni template. After phosphating reaction in a tube furnace, Ni2P/Fe2P (denoted as MNPBA-P) is obtained. MNPBA-P can still maintain the initial structure of nanocubes on a carnation-shaped MOF-Ni, which causes it to have better conductivity and larger electrochemical active surface area. As a bifunctional catalyst, MNPBA-P has a good performance in the catalytic reaction of cathode and anode. It is worth noting that when 0.5 M urea was added to the electrolyte, the high anode overpotential is greatly improved. Compared with overall water-splitting, MNPBA-P assembled into an electrolyzer requires smaller cell voltage in urea electrolysis. MNPBA-P parallel to MNPBA-P electrolyzer only needs 1.50 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in urea electrolyte and has a good stability for 12 h.

This anodic reaction generates hydrogen or electrical power through direct electrooxidation of urea molecules, but is greatly inhibited by its slow kinetics. Therefore, tailoring highly efficient, earth-abundant, and durable electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a fundamental for the enhancement of green energy conversion technologies. Herein, we report a scalable synthetic strategy to construct three-dimensional (3D) nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays (NiCo-LDH NSAs) with silver (Ag-0) or gold (Au-0) and palladium (Pd-0) intercalants as high performance catalysts for UOR. Experimental results suggest that the interlayer spacing of multi-anions LDH NSAs can effectively afford synergetic effects of increased electrochemical surface area, better exposure of catalytically active sites, and favorable adsorption energy of urea molecules. As expected, the deposition of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) could successfully modulate the electronic structure, delivering a rise to significantly improved UOR activity. Specifically, the Au/NiCo-LDH hybrid exhibits a superior electro-catalytic performance toward urea electrooxidation with a highest current. These findings offer an effective pathway to prepare potential earth-abundant electrocatalysts for direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs).

However, conventional methods of introducing heterogeneous atoms into nickel sulfides are usually complex multi-step reaction and time consuming or unable to gain satisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, pulsed laser ablation in liquids, as a simple and fast synthesis technique, was employed to prepare cobalt-doped Ni3S4-NiS/Ni nanomaterials with the composite morphology of nanosheets and nanoparticles. The first-principles calculation and experimental results indicated that cobalt doping into nickel sulfides can modify the electronic structure and morphology of nickel sulfide and thus promote the internal electron transport, enrich the redox sites and boost electrochemical performance. The optimized cobalt-doped Ni3S4-NiS/Ni electrode materials presented an outstanding specific capacity with 1940 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and UOR catalytic property with a potential of 1.350 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the cobalt-doped Ni3S4-NiS/Ni/ /AC device also exhibited excellent energy and power densities and good cyclic stability of 87.27% after 3000 cycles. This work can provide a simple and availably strategy for exploring other element doping electrode materials with fast electron transport.
