Catalytic approaches for enabling these transformations are of utmost importance and integral to advancing this area of synthesis. In exploring this chemical space, a combined experimental and computational mechanistic study of pyranylation and 2-deoxygalactosylation catalyzed by a cationic thiourea organocatalyst is reported. To this end, a thiourea-cyclopropenium organocatalyst was employed as a model system in combination with an arsenal of mechanistic techniques, including C-13 kinetic isotope effect experiments, deuterated labeling studies, variable-temperature H-1 NMR spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. From these studies, two distinct reaction pathways were identified for this transformation corresponding to either dual hydrogen bond (H-bond) activation or Bronsted acid catalysis. The former involving thiourea orchestrated bifurcated hydrogen bonding proceeded in an asynchronous concerted fashion. In contrast, the latter stepwise mechanism involving Bronsted acid catalysis hinged upon the formation of an oxocarbenium intermediate accompanied by subsequent alcohol addition.

Here, the synthesis of N,N '-dibutylurea through catalytic carbonylation of 1-butanamine by CO2 over MnO2 heterogeneous catalysts was systematically investigated. Four polymorphs of MnO2, including alpha-MnO2, beta-MnO2, delta-MnO2 and gamma-MnO2 with various morphological shapes were synthesized by hydrothermal method through altering the synthesis conditions (raw materials or parameters). Significant impact of the lattice structure of the MnO2 oxides on the catalytic activity was demonstrated. Among them, delta-MnO2 possessed the most favorable catalytic activity with N,N '-dibutylurea yield as high as 85.78 % at 160 degrees C for 24 h in CO2, while it is only 76.70 % for the alpha-MnO2, although they showed the similar specific surface area of around 10 m(2) g(-1). To understand the different catalytic behaviors among the different structured MnO2, the catalysts were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption of CO2. It was discovered that the excellent performance of delta-MnO2 was ascribed to its high surface basicity from its high concentration of lattice oxygen on surface of MnO2, while the large amount of surface unsaturated coordination manganese also positively affected the catalytic performance of gamma-MnO2. It suggests enhancement of surface basicity and defect concentration is critical for the development of superior MnO2-based catalysts for the green synthesis of N,N '-dibutylurea from catalytic carbonylation of 1-butanamine by CO2.					shao, zongping/B-5250-2013; , San Ping Jiang/M-6967-2017														2212-9820	2212-9839				JUN	2021	48								101525	10.1016/j.jcou.2021.101525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2021.101525		APR 2021											WOS:000663082500004

Small-sized metal Ru nanoparticles, with metal-hydrogen bond strength close to Pt (approximately 65 kcal/mol) and a relatively lower water dissociation barrier, are considered one of the most promising alternatives to the noble metal Pt for alkaline HER. Based on the above statements, the present study innovatively combines the effective strategies of "heterogeneous interface engineering" and "construction of ultrafine active sites" to develop a highly efficient Ru-based catalyst with a three-phase heterogeneous interface, aiming to form its application in alkaline HER. Characterization analysis and DFT calculations demonstrated that the "Rux-Ni(OH)(2)-NiO" three-phase heterogeneous interface constructed around ultrafine Rux clusters effectively modulated the electronic structure of the overall material and optimized the HER kinetic steps. This catalytic material, Rux@NOH/NO, exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity in alkaline HER, requiring only 44.2 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2), with excellent long-term stability and extremely low active material loading (1.36 wt%-Ru). Specially, its mass activity reached an impressive 18,897.1 A/gRu at 150 mV, which is 10.2 times higher than that of commercial 20wt % Pt/C. In summary, this study synergistically constructs an ultrafine metal ruthenium-based catalyst based on a three-phase heterogeneous interface using a composite strategy, which provides an effective catalyst system for alkaline HER catalytic reactions and holds significance for the rational construction and design of efficient heterogeneous interface electrocatalysts.

We present an air-breathing paper-based mu FC connected to a pregnancy test, and for the first time, as far as we know, it is powered by human urine without needing any external electrolyte. It uses TiO2-Ni as anode and Pt/C as cathode; the performance shows a maximum value of voltage and current and power densities of similar to 0.96 V, 1.00 mA cm(-2), and 0.23 mW cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, we present a simple design of a paper-based mu FC's stack powered with urine that shows a maximum voltage and maximum current and power densities of similar to 1.89 V, 2.77 mA cm(-2) and 1.38 mW cm(-2), respectively, which powers the display of a pregnancy test allowing to see the analysis results.

However, there is still room for improvement in their performance compared to other renewable biomass resources. In our study, we successfully converted EFB biomass into porous activated carbon with outstanding performance, achieving a remarkably high specific capacitance of 459.28 F/g at 0.5 A/g, along with a moderate specific surface area (SSA) of 1215.38 m2/g. Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state supercapacitor assembled from the AC700 sample demonstrated excellent energy density, reaching 15.39 Wh/kg at a power density of 50 W/kg. Additionally, it exhibited remarkable cycling stability, with a capacitance retention of 93 % after 10,000 cycles. These exceptional results were achieved by simply adjusting the activation temperature. We utilized KOH as the activating agent and carbonized it at temperatures of 600 degrees C, 700 degrees C, and 800 degrees C for 2 h under an N2 atmosphere. The superior capacitive performance of the AC700 sample can be attributed to the combined effects of its high SSA, surface functional groups, and optimal pore size distribution. The optimum activation temperature of 700 degrees C resulted in the formation of porous activated carbon with the most structural defects, as well as an appropriate distribution of micropores (63.41 %) and mesopores (31.70 %), facilitating ion diffusion and providing multiple sites for charge storage. Additionally, the AC700 sample exhibited the highest SiO2 content, measuring at 34.33 %, and the lowest contact angle of 75 degrees. The presence of SiO2 in the carbon framework promotes the formation of more hydrophilic active sites, thereby enhancing the pseudocapacitance performance and facilitating sufficient wetting between the electrolyte and electrode interface.

J	Nieminen, J; Liukkonen, A; Pihlajamäki, A; Mänttäri, M				Nieminen, Joona; Liukkonen, Alma; Pihlajamaki, Arto; Manttari, Mika			Charge-adhered microfibrillar cellulose multilayer as a flow-modulating membrane coating: Solute separation by shape	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Functional microfibrillar cellulose coatings for ultrafiltration membranes were prepared and characterized. For this purpose, a strategy for converting cotton cellulose into microfibres by incubation in a deep eutectic solvent of choline chloride and malonic acid, with no mechanical disintegration step, was created. The microfibres were furthermore modified to possess either cationic or anionic surface charges to allow charge-assisted adhesion of the fibres on ultrafiltration membrane surface. The adhesion was significantly improved by the electrostatic attraction, and it allowed building durable multilayer coatings by Layer-by-Layer methodology for membrane filtration purposes. The polyelectrolyte-inspired Layer-by-Layer strategy for depositing microfibrillar celluloses onto a membrane makes it possible to create coatings out of pure, only slightly derived cellulose, with no need for incorporating hazardous cross-linkers or synthetic polymers into the matrix. The deposited multilayer introduces a shear-force modulating functionality to the membrane which furthermore allows the permeation of molecules that have larger Stokes-Einstein radii than the membrane pore radius. This permeation is selective towards a linear polymer (poly(ethylene glycol)), while a more globular model substance with a similar molar mass (lignin) is highly rejected. The resulting filtration properties can furthermore be easily tuned by controlling the coating thickness.

The reduction activities for almost all the M-VW catalysts were enhanced at reaction temperature >400 degrees C, but only the Co-VW catalyst showed an increased activity at temperature <400 degrees C. Among the M-VW catalysts tested, the Co-VW sample had the highest catalytic activity with a temperature range of 300-550 degrees C for more than 90% NO removal at a GHSV of 60 000 h(-1). Moreover, the Co-VW sample exhibited high space-velocity, H2O and SO2 resistance, and low N2O yield. Co partial substitution for V in the VW led to more Lewis acid sites and Bronsted acid sites, and an obvious increase in the ratio of the adsorbed oxygen to the lattice oxygen from 12.74% for VW to 36.73% for Co-VW. The increased adsorbed oxygen and Lewis and Bronsted acid sites contributed to the improved SCR activity of the Co-VW sample. (C) 2014 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

The effect of potassium loading on the NOx storage and reduction performance of the catalyst was studied. In the catalyst, the K2CO3 exists as highly dispersed K2CO3 and bulk K2CO3. In the lean. burn period, the nitrates formed on the bulk K2CO3 have high thermal stability at high operating temperature, while the thermal stability of the nitrates formed on the highly dispersed K2CO3 is low. When the K loading is low, the K2CO3 mainly exists as highly dispersed K2CO3, the limited NOx storage capacity and the low thermal stability of the nitrates result in the low NSR activity at high temperature. While too much K2CO3 loaded on the catalyst can decrease the redox ability of CuO by covering it, which will decrease the NSR activity of the catalysts. When the K loading is 10%, the best NSR activity is obtained with the highest NOx reduction percentage of 99. 9% at 450 degrees C. Therefore, the CuO/K2CO3/MgAl2O4 catalyst is a promising high. temperature NSR catalyst.

Understanding the reversible electrodeposition of aluminum in low-cost room-temperature molten salts	CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE												Aluminum is the most earth-abundant metal, trivalent, and inert in ambient air; it also has a density approximately five times that of lithium at room temperature, making it attractive for cost-effective, long-duration storage in batteries. Here, we investigate structural requirements and physicochemical and transport properties of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes thought to enable high reversibility of Al battery anodes. We find that intentionally designed, low-cost IL analogs, including ammonium-based molten salts, offer comparable Al anode reversibility to state-of-the-art imidazolium-based IL melts. A critical ratio of solvated Al-ion species is required to balance the effects of Lewis acidity needed to continuously etch native Al2O3 and form a stable solid electrolyte interphase on Al.

Ultrafast Spectroscopy Reveals Electron-Transfer Cascade That Improves Hydrogen Evolution with Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Solar hydrogen generation from water represents a Compelling component of a future sustainable energy portfolio. Recently, chemically robust heptazine-based polymers known as graphitic carbon nitrides (g-c(3)N(4)) have emerged as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution using-visible light while withstanding harsh chemical environments. However, since g-C3N4 electron-transfer dynamics are poorly understood, rational design rules for improving activity remain unclear. Here, we use visible and near-infrared femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to reveal an electron-transfer cascade that correlates with A near-doubling in photocatalytic activity from 2050 to 3810 mu mol(-1) g(-1) when we infuse a suspension of bulk g-C3N4 with 10% mass loading of chemically exfoliated carbon nitride. TA spectroscopy indicates that exfoliated carbon nitride quenches photogenerated electrons on g-C3N4 at rates approaching the molecular diffusion limit. The TA signal for photogenerated electrons on g-C3N4 decays with a time constant of 1/k(e)' 660 ps in the mixture versus 1/k(e) = 4.1 ns in g-C3N4 alone. Our TA measurements suggest that the charge generation efficiency in g-C3N4 is greater than 65%. Exfoliated carbon nitride, which liberates only trace hydrogen levels when photoexcited directly, does not appear to, independently sustain appreciable long-lived charge generation. Thus, the activity enhancement in the two-component infusion evidently results from a cooperative effect in which charge is generated on g-C3N4, followed by electron transfer to exfoliated carbon nitride containing photocatalytic chain terminations. This correlation between electron transfer and photocatalytic activity, provides new insight into structural modifications for controlling charge separation dynamics and activity of carbon-based photocatalysts.

It has the potential to significantly decrease fossil fuel consumption, optimize energy structure and solve environmental issues. However, because biomass possess multiple groups and its conversion involves multiple electrons, electrocatalvtic biomass conversion suffer from low conversion efficiency, bad selectivity and poor stability. Surface and interface chemistry engineering, such as regulating intrinsic structure, generating vacancies, introducing heteroatom, and constructing synergistic interface, can design and modify two-dimensional electrocatalysts to optimize their electronic structure and geometric structure, and effectively improve the electrocatalytic efficiency, selectivity and stability.

This necessitates the development of advanced electrocatalysts. Ni-based nanomaterials, known for their unique electronic structure and high intrinsic activity, show great promise for the selective electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA. To provide guidance for the further development of advanced HMF electrocatalysts, we present a comprehensive review of recent progress in this field, focusing on HMFOR mechanisms, effective engineering strategies (e.g., morphology design, defect engineering, interface engineering, and strain engineering) for improving electrocatalytic performance, and representative Ni-based catalysts used for HMFOR. Finally, we offer a conclusion and highlight the challenging issues that need to be addressed, providing researchers with direction for future endeavors.					gao, shaoyan/HPG-2952-2023														0360-3199	1879-3487				JUN 27	2024	72						149	165		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.372		MAY 2024											WOS:001246539200001
J	Wu, YF; Song, XH; Cai, FF; Xiao, GM				Wu, Yuanfeng; Song, Xianghai; Cai, Fufeng; Xiao, Guomin			Synthesis of glycerol carbonate from glycerol and diethyl carbonate over Ce-NiO catalyst: The role of multiphase Ni	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												A series of Ce-NiO catalysts prepared by co-precipitation method were tested for glycerol trans-esterification with diethyl carbonate (DEC) to produce glycerol carbonate (GC). The microstructural and physicochemical properties of the catalysts were determined by XRD, XPS, SEM, EDX, CO2-TPD, N-2-adsorption, FT-IR, and TG-DTG. The results showed that the particle size (100-350 nm) of the Ce-NiO was smaller than that of pure NiO (400-900 nm), suggesting addition of Ce in the catalyst synthesis could lessen the aggregation or facilitate the dispersion of NiO particles. The highest catalyst activity was observed over the Ce-NiO catalyst with Ce/Ni atomic ratio of 0.2 and calcined at 400 degrees C. 94.14% of glycerol conversion and 90.95% selectivity to GC were obtained over this catalyst under the optimum conditions (5 wt.% catalyst of glycerol, 85 degrees C, 8 h, glycerol/DEC ratio of 1:3). This catalyst can be reused up to three cycles with a slight decrease in its catalytic activity. It was found the well dispersed NiO particles and the strong basic sites derived from the substitution of Ce4+ by Ni2+ in the CeO2 lattices synergistically promoted the glycerol conversion.

Besides, microcrystalline cellulose was functionalized to obtain aminated cellulose, which was dissolved in an aqueous solution and used as a specific adhesive. Subsequently, an ultra -strong wood bonding interface was co-constructed with the activated wood surface and aminated cellulose, which was formed by a chemical covalent reaction between aldehyde groups at the activated wood interface and amino groups on aminated cellulose. The dry, hot-water, and boiling-water lap shear strengths of the plywood specimens were 1.47, 1.07, and 1.08 MPa, respectively. The boiling-water strength of the plywood made from the activated wood surface achieved increased to 1.08 MPa from 0 MPa of the plywood constructed on the nonac-tivated wood surface. The chemical crosslinking reaction and bonding mechanism between the adhesive and activated wood surface were clarified by density functional theory calculations, attenuated total reflectan-ce-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that chemical bonding (aminal N-C-N and imine C--N) at the bonding interface played an important part in improving the water resistance and bonding strength. This work provides new concepts for designing durable and moisture-resistant wood products.

In order to overcome these limitations, melamine impregnated MnOx-CeO2/carbon aerogels were synthesized by the incipient wetness impregnation method for low-temperature NH3-free SCR of NO. The combination of carbon aerogels with highly interconnected mesoporous structures and uniform dispersed MnOx-CeO2 can not only promote the chemisorption of nitrogen oxides but also increase the amounts of active metal sites and surface chemisorbed oxygen. Moreover, the impregnated melamine as reductant instead of NH3 is effective to eliminate NO, avoiding the secondary pollution derived from the escape of NH3. Therefore, the catalyst 400-12(Mn-Ce)/QS-15mel exhibits outstanding activity with 100% steady state NOx conversion for 7 h at 185 degrees C. Mechanism analysis indicates that melamine-SCR is accompanied by the variation of -NH2 and the generation of adsorbed HNCO, which could further participate in the reduction of NO without any byproducts. This work gives an in-depth understanding of the reactivity and mechanism of melamine-SCR and offers a novel route for the design of highly efficient catalysts.

J	Sirvio, JA; Kantola, AM; Amma, A				Sirvio, Juho Antti; Kantola, Anu Maria; Amma, Ari			Cellulose nanofibers from nonbleached and hydrogen peroxide bleached acidic thiourea treated sawdust	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Here a single-step acidic thiourea delignification without and with sequential hydrogen peroxide bleaching were used as a pre-treatment for producing low-lignin-containing cellulose nanofibers (LCNF) and bleached cellulose nanofibers (BCNF), respectively. Without bleaching, LCNF contained 7 wt% lignin, resulting in a slightly yellowish color in both the water dispersion and film. Despite low gravimetric yield of nanosize fibers, 23 wt% after microfluidization, the LCNF films exhibited notable mechanical strength, with a tensile strength of 174 MPa and a modulus of 11 GPa. Upon introducing an additional bleaching step, the color was eliminated, reducing the lignin content to 3 wt%. This adjustment also led to a significant increase in the gravimetric yield of nanofibers, reaching 78 wt%. The BCNF films demonstrated even higher mechanical performance, with a tensile strength of 207 MPa and a modulus of 12 GPa. LCNF film exhibited a higher contact angle (approximate to 70 degrees) than BCNF (approximate to 60 degrees), presumably due to the higher lignin content of the nonbleached pulp. Furthermore, hot pressing of the films at 150 degrees C for 18 min substantially enhanced the wet strength of the films by over 50%, attributed to the residual lignin.					; Kantola, Anu/N-5847-2014	Sirvio, Juho/0000-0002-7404-3340; Kantola, Anu/0000-0003-1945-9201													0959-6526	1879-1786				OCT 15	2023	423								138824	10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138824	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138824													WOS:001150021000001
J	Sirviö, JA; Visanko, M				Sirvio, Juho Antti; Visanko, Miikka			Anionic wood nanofibers produced from unbleached mechanical pulp by highly efficient chemical modification	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A												Chemical modification of lignocellulosic materials, especially as a pre-treatment in nanocellulose production, has mainly been conducted with lignin-free bleached cellulose pulps. However, non-bleached pulp exhibits several advantages over bleached pulp, namely excluding of the use of hazardous bleaching chemicals, higher yield, and lower cost. In this study, the chemical modification of lignocellulose (groundwood pulp, GWP) with a high lignin content (27.4 wt%) was investigated using a deep eutectic solvent (DES) as a reaction medium. A low-melting DES was easily obtained within one hour by mixing triethylmethylammonium chloride (TEMACl) and imidazole at room temperature. Carboxylated GWP was obtained by adding succinic anhydride to the DES. Under mild reaction conditions (2 h at 70 degrees C), carboxylic acid contents of 1.88-3.34 mmol g(-1) were obtained depending on the anhydride dosage used (5-20 mmol/1 g of pulp) with excellent yield (over 90%). The GWP was more reactive in the pre-treatment step, measuring carboxylic acid contents higher than those of bleached cellulose pulps treated under identical reaction conditions (containing less than 0.5 wt% lignin). After deprotonation of the carboxylic acid groups, highly anionic wood nanofibers (AWNFs) were produced using a microfluidizer. Vacuum filtration was applied in the preparation of self-standing films, which had good mechanical properties and were transparent. The fabricated AWNFs have many potential uses-for instance, in sustainable water purification because of their adjustable surface charge.

Therefore, the catalytic transesterification of glycerol and dimethyl carbonate for the synthesis of glycerol carbonate was studied using Cu-Zn-Mg-Al mixed oxide catalysts with different Cu-Zn atomic ratios. Layered double hydroxides were the precursors materials to obtain multi metallic oxides. They were synthesized by coprecipitation. The materials were physico-chemically characterized by XRD, MP-AES, N2 sorption, SEM, XPS and TPDCO2. The addition of Cu and Zn to the Mg and Al matrix improved the catalytic behaviour of the solid materials. First, the highest glycerol carbonate yield was reached with the catalyst with the highest Zn load at 70 degrees C for 90 min. This result was taken as a basis to modify parameters and find the optimal reaction conditions. They were a temperature of 85 degrees C, a reaction time of 270 min, a DMC:glycerol molar ratio of 2:1, solvent free and 7.5 wt% of catalyst. The highest yield obtained (82%) was attributable to the synergistic effect of the Cu-Zn load promoted by an adequate distribution of basicity and textural properties. The reuses of the best catalyst were also investigated.

NiAl-LDH was introduced into acetalization of furfural to furfural diethyl acetal for the first time. As the result showed that carbonate form LDH (marked as NiAl-CO3-LDH) obtained at basic pH presented inert activity as for the absence of appropriate acid activity sites. However, while at acidic pH ambience, nitrate form LDH (marked as NiAl-NO3-LDH) was produced. NiAl-NO3-LDH expressed preferable acid catalytic property with fine acid activity sites, when setting reaction time of 30 minutes, the equilibrium conversion of furfural was up to 78.5% and the selectivity of furfural diethyl acetal was nearly 100%. Besides, it could be recycled several times and showed stable activity without structural change. Different from the BrOnsted acidity catalysts, this is an excellent result ever achieved for the synthesis of furfural diethyl acetal on the Lewis acidic catalyst.					wu, xu/JXM-9983-2024	Wu, Xu/0000-0002-4997-2148													2365-6549					JUL 23	2018	3	27					7996	8002		10.1002/slct.201800302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.201800302													WOS:000439756200046

There is a need to understand the impacts of different fertilizer application depths on crop production and gas emissions to facilitate the sustainable development of dryland agriculture. Methods A field experiment was conducted for two years (2019-2020) in a dryland agroecosystem in the Loess Plateau region of China. Five fertilizer placement depths were tested comprising 0 cm (FD0), 5 cm (FD5), 15 cm (FD15), 25 cm (FD25), and 35 cm (FD35). N-P-K fertilizer was applied to all treatments as base fertilizer at the same rate. After sowing, the gas emission fluxes were measured 17 consecutive times. We systematically analyzed the effects of different fertilization depths on the summer maize (Zhengdan 958) yield, ammonia (NH3) volatilization, and greenhouse gas emissions (nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4)). Results The results showed that the NH3 volatilization, N2O emissions, CO2 emissions, and global warming potential (GWP) decreased as the fertilization depth increased. Compared with the traditional fertilization depth (FD5), deep fertilization at 15 cm clearly reduced the NH3 volatilization, N2O emissions, CO2 emissions, GWP, and greenhouse gas intensity. In addition, compared with FD25 or FD35, FD15 increased the capacity of the soil to absorb CH4. Critically, compared with the traditional fertilization depth, FD15 can effectively improve the summer maize biomass yield (4.2%) and grain yield (18.1%) at the final harvest. Conclusion FD15 can promote the sustainable development of dryland agriculture in the Loess Plateau region of China by improving crop production and reducing gas emissions.					zhang, pengshuai/HGF-2832-2022; Liu, Gaoxiang/LFR-7711-2024; Liu, Feihua/IQT-2241-2023	Zhang, Peng/0000-0001-6739-8373													0032-079X	1573-5036				JUN	2024	499	1-2			SI		73	89		10.1007/s11104-022-05795-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05795-6		NOV 2022											WOS:000886832000001

In the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx over V2O5/WO3-TiO2, formaldehyde was found to react with NH3 to produce HCN at concentrations above the threshold limit value set by environmental/ safety organizations. Due to this side reaction, NH3 is consumed parasitically and the NOx conversion decreases by up to 15 %, even after compensating for the fraction of lost NH3. Under similar conditions, the non-reducible TiO2 support also produced HCN moderately, thereby showing that redox sites promote the reaction but are not a necessary condition. To understand the chemistry responsible for HCN formation, the roles of reaction temperature, water, and oxygen were investigated. Our results suggest a new pathway for HCN production through the direct reaction of formaldehyde and NH3, which is active at high temperature and does not proceed through the formate route previously proposed.

J	Shaabani, A; Afshari, R				Shaabani, Ahmad; Afshari, Ronak			Magnetic Ugi-functionalized graphene oxide complexed with copper nanoparticles: Efficient catalyst toward Ullman coupling reaction in deep eutectic solvents	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												Herein, we report the direct synthesis of carboxamide-functionalized graphene oxide (carboxamide-f-GO) for the development of new nanocatalysts, with highly dispersed particles, through covalent functionalization with a facile and direct strategy. This surface functionalization was carried out through a one-pot sequential four-component Ugi reaction. Subsequently, the Ugi-ligand decorated on the surface of the graphene oxide sheets coordinated with copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) and finally covered with magnetic nanoparticles. The synthesized nanocatalyst was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((HNMR)-H-1), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), dynamic light scattering (DLS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The carboxamido nitrogen in Ugi-ligand showed high affinity toward complexation with Cu NPs and has a profound effect on the reactivity of the copper center in this nanocatalyst. The catalytic activity of nanocatalyst was investigated in Ullmann cross-coupling reaction for practical and direct access to corresponding N-aryl amines in a deep eutectic solvent as a green and recyclable media. The results showed the capability of this designed catalytic system through N-arylation of N-heterocycles and aniline derivatives with high yields in short reaction times. In addition, both of the nanocatalyst and deep eutectic solvent were easily recovered and reused for five consecutive runs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Vanadia supported on tungsten titania (V2O5/WO3-TiO2) is most widely utilized for NH3-SCR because of its high tolerance to sulfur. Although it exhibits stable performance under SO2 in the stream, there are still unsolved sulfur poisoning issues under low-temperature operations due to the accumulation of ammonium bisulfate (ABS). In this study, we introduce a hybrid catalyst comprising V2O5/WO3-TiO2 physically mixed with alumina (VWTi + Al), which exhibited superior stability during SO2 aging compared to conventional vanadia catalysts. The improved sulfur tolerance originates from the direct migration of in-situ formed ABS from the vanadia domain to the alumina domain through physical contact rather than gas-phase SO2 adsorption on alumina. Interestingly, the mixed alumina maintains superior affinity to ABS as well as reusability after repetitive SO2 aging and regeneration. In addition, the protection ability, i.e. affinity to ABS, of mixed alumina closely related to its surface properties including acidity and pore size. The present study suggests that the hybrid catalyst can be an applicable catalyst to NOx removal process in stationary sources and a breakthrough for the decrease of pollutants emission.

However, the responses of soil CH4 emissions to these factors and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of land-use conversion from paddies to orchards and fertilization on soil CH4 fluxes, and the abundance and community compositions of methanogens and methanotrophs. Soil CH4 fluxes were quantified by static chamber and gas chromatography technology. Abundance and community structures of methanogens and methanotrophs (based on mcrA and pmoA genes, respectively) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP), cloning and sequence analysis, respectively. Results showed that land-use conversion from paddies to orchards dramatically decreased soil CH4 fluxes, whereas fertilization did not distinctly affect soil CH4 fluxes. Furthermore, abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs were decreased after converting paddies to orchards. Fertilization decreased the abundance of these microorganisms, but the values were not statistically significant. Moreover, land-use conversion had fatal effects on some members of the methanogenic archaea (Methanoregula and Methanosaeta), increased type II methanotrophs (Methylocystis and Methylosinus), and decreased type I methanotrophs (Methylobacter and Methylococcus). However, fertilization could only significantly affect type I methanotrophs in the orchard plots. In addition, CH4 fluxes from paddy soils were positively correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon contents and methanogens abundance, whereas CH4 fluxes in orchard plots were negatively related to methanotroph abundance. Therefore, our results suggested that land-use conversion from paddies to orchards could change the abundance and community compositions of methanogens and methanotrophs, and ultimately alter the soil CH4 fluxes.

The single crystal X-ray structures for 1-4 and 8 are reported. The IR and P-31 NMR data are in accordance with strong hydrogen bonding of the di(hydroperoxy)adamantane adducts. The Raman v(O-O) stretching bands of 1-4 prove that the peroxo groups are present in the solids. Selected di(hydroperoxy)alkane adducts, in combination with AlCl3 as catalyst, have been applied for the direct oxidative esterification of n-nonyl aldehyde, benzaldehyde, p-methylbenzaldehyde, p-bromobenzaldehyde, and o-hydroxybenzaldehyde to the corresponding methyl esters. The esterification takes place in an inert atmosphere, under anhydrous and oxygen-free conditions, within a time frame of 45 minutes to 5 hours at room temperature. Hereby, two oxygen atoms per adduct assembly are active with respect to the quantitative transformation of the aldehyde into the ester.					; Bluemel, Janet/C-1759-2015	Ashirov, Rahym/0000-0002-0083-2275; Bluemel, Janet/0000-0002-6557-3518; Eberle, Fabian Felix/0000-0002-4816-5803													1477-9226	1477-9234				NOV 2	2021	50	42					15296	15309		10.1039/d1dt03243g	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1dt03243g		OCT 2021						34636381					WOS:000706333300001

Accompanying the long experimental practice to optimize the catalyst, atomic simulations, mainly based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have been performed in recent years to reveal the atomic structure of NiOOH and the reaction mechanism in catalysis. Due to both the structural complexity and the difficulty in computing the electronic structure, there are great concerns over the accuracy of first-principles methods and the validity of the structure models. This Perspective serves to overview the current status of atomic simulation on the structure and catalysis of NiOOH. We first present NiOOH phases and structures obtained by the latest global optimization methods in combination with machine learning potentials. The electronic structures of NiOOH are then described by comparing the performance of different theoretical levels, in particular, those based on PBE+U and hybrid functionals in DFT calculations. Finally, taking the oxygen evolution reaction of water splitting as the example, we elaborate the catalytic mechanism on pure, defective, and Fe-doped NiOOH surfaces and provide insights into the exceptional activity of the doped system. The further directions for theoretical investigations on NiOOH are also discussed.					; Liu, Zhipan/A-1988-2011	Li, Ji-Li/0000-0003-4717-561X; Liu, Zhipan/0000-0002-2906-5217													1932-7447	1932-7455				DEC 16	2021	125	49					27033	27045		10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c06170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c06170													WOS:000755081200001

Herein, at first, the reductant ascorbic acid (VC) was used for reducing Fe(iii)EDTA. The feasibility of Fe(iii)EDTA reduction with ascorbic acid was investigated at different Fe(iii)EDTA concentrations, various pH values, diverse temperatures, and different molar ratios of VC to Fe(iii)EDTA. The results showed that the Fe(ii)EDTA concentration increased with an increase in the initial Fe(iii)EDTA concentration. Furthermore, the reduction efficiency increased as the mole ratio of VC to Fe(iii)EDTA was increased, and all the Fe(iii)EDTA reduction efficiencies were close to 100% when the mole ratio was more than 0.5. On the other hand, an alkaline environment did not favor the conversion of Fe(iii)EDTA by VC. The Fe(iii)EDTA conversion slightly increased as the temperature was increased. Moreover, compared with other reduction systems, ascorbic acid (VC) was found to be more powerful in reducing Fe(iii)EDTA, especially in air. In addition, VC only exhibited powerful ability in the conversion of Fe(iii)EDTA to Fe(ii)EDTA and hardly reduced Fe(ii)EDTA-NO. Finally, the stoichiometry of Fe(iii)EDTA reduction by ascorbic acid was derived. Thus, our study would offer a bridge between foundational research and industrial denitration using the combination of Fe(ii)EDTA and VC.

Mounting evidence has confirmed the functional importance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in nitrification and N2O production; however, their responses to DMPP amendment and the microbial mechanisms underlying the variable efficiencies of DMPP across different soils remain largely unknown. Here we compared the impacts of DMPP on nitrification and the dynamics of ammonia oxidizers between an acidic pasture soil and an alkaline vegetable soil using a N-15 tracing and (CO2)-C-13-DNA-stableisotope probing (SIP) technique. The results showed that DMPP significantly inhibited nitrification and N2O production in the vegetable soil only, and the transient inhibition was coupled with a significant decrease in AOB abundance. No significant effects on the community structure of ammonia oxidizers or the abundances of total bacteria and denitrifiers were observed in either soil. The N-15 tracing experiment revealed that autotrophic nitrification was the predominant form of nitrification in both soils. The (CO2)-C-13-DNA-SIP results indicated the involvement of AOB in active nitrification in both soils, but DMPP inhibited the assimilation of (CO2)-C-13 into AOB only in the vegetable soil. Our findings provide evidence that DMPP could effectively inhibit nitrification through impeding the abundance and metabolic activity of AOB in the alkaline vegetable soil but not in the acidic pasture soil, possibly due to the low AOB abundance or the adsorption of DMPP by organic matter. IMPORTANCE The combination of the N-15 tracing model and (CO2)-C-13-DNA-SIP technique provides important evidence that the nitrification inhibitor DMPP could effectively inhibit nitrification and nitrous oxide emission in an alkaline soil through influencing the abundance and metabolic activity of AOB. In contrast, DMPP amendment has no significant effect on nitrification or nitrifiers in an acidic soil, potentially owing to the low abundance of AOB and the possible adsorption of DMPP by organic matter. Our findings have direct implications for improved agricultural practices through utilizing the nitrification inhibitor DMPP in appropriate situations, and they emphasize the importance of microbial communities to the efficacy of DMPP.

However, cancer recurrence and metastasis frequently occur after all RT due to the existence of intractable cancer stem cells (CSCs). To address this, a biomimetic nanoplatform (named TAFL) of tumor-derived exosome fusion liposomes is designed by co-loading aggregation-induced emission photothermal agents, TPE-BBT, and anti-cancer drugs, aspirin, aiming to clear CSCs for inhibiting cancer recurrence and metastasis after FLASH-RT therapy . Aspirin released in TAFL system triggered by laser irradiation can induce apoptosis and DNA damage of 4T1 CSCs, comprehensively downregulate their stemness phenotype, and inhibit their sphericity. Furthermore, the TPE-BBT mediated mild-photothermal therapy can alleviate the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, inhibit the DNA repair of CSCs, which further amplifies the effect of aspirin against CSCs, therefore reduces the effective dose of aspirin, making TAFL more biologically safe. In vivo experimental results demonstrated that decreased CSCs population mediated by TAFL system treatment significantly inhibited tumor recurrence and metastasis after FLASH-RT therapy. In summary, this TAFL system provides a new idea for the future clinical application of FLASH-RT therapy. A biomimetic nanoplatform (named TAFL) is designed. TAFL completely down-regulated stemness phenotype of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and inhibited their pellet-forming ability. In vivo experimental results demonstrated that the CSCs population decreased notably after TAFL combined with FLASH-RT therapy radiation treatment under laser irradiation, thus significantly inhibiting tumor recurrence and metastasis post-FLASH-RT therapy. image					Shen, Chenguang/JVE-0944-2024; Tang, Weihua/AFM-3136-2022; Zhang, Tianfu/AGA-3642-2022; Jiang, Yi/W-5440-2018; Tang, Ben Zhong/B-3556-2009	Tang, Ben Zhong/0000-0002-0293-964X; SHEN, Hanchen/0000-0002-3629-6873													1613-6810	1613-6829				JUL	2024	20	29								10.1002/smll.202400666	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202400666		FEB 2024						38368259					WOS:001163767500001

The results demonstrate that the natural manganese ore catalyst possesses superior alkaline resistance performance with a high NOx conversion for NH3-SCR of NOx at a low temperature. There are two factors responsible for the alkaline resistance performance. Firstly, the NH3 adsorption capacity (more acid sites) of K-poisoned catalysts is stronger than that of fresh catalyst, which is beneficial for the NOx conversion. Secondly, the K-poisoned catalyst has a smaller specific surface area, lower concentrations of Fe3+, Mn4+, and O-alpha, and lower reducibility, which leads to an inhibition effect on the NOx conversion. There exists a competition mechanism between the promotional and inhibition effect on the NOx conversion. The combination of these two effects leads to natural manganese ore exhibiting a superior alkaline resistance performance.

To solve this problem, ascorbic acid (VC) combined with Fe(II)EDTA was used for NO removal. The influences of various operating parameters like Fe(II)EDTA concentration, VC concentration, original pH value and temperature on NO removal in bubbling device were examined preliminarily. The results revealed that the VC can greatly improve NO removal by Fe(II)EDTA. NO removal efficiency increased with the increasing of VC concentration as well as Fe(II)EDTA concentration. Low temperature or low O-2 concentration was conducive to the absorption of NO. NO removal efficiency increased and then decreased with pH value increasing. For initial Fe(II)EDTA concentration of 0.016 M, pH and temperature had little effect on NO removal efficiency. In addition, the kinetic studies showed that compared with normal Fe(II)EDTA approach, NO absorption by mixed Fe(II)EDTA and VC was more effective in reducing total mass transfer resistance and enlarging the NO flux. The absorption process was controlled by the liquid film. Finally, Ncontaining product was determined as NO2- and NO3-, suggesting that NO was mainly translated into nitrite and nitrate.					zhu, xinyu/HJJ-1063-2023; Ding, Jinghua/O-2381-2013														0016-2361	1873-7153				JAN 15	2021	284								119070	10.1016/j.fuel.2020.119070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.119070													WOS:000586954400062

Revisiting hydrotalcite synthesis: Efficient combined mechanochemical/coprecipitation synthesis to design advanced tunable basic catalysts	NANOTECHNOLOGY REVIEWS												Hydrotalcite materials (HTs) were synthesized by a facile and swift combined mechanochemistry/coprecipitation approach, and their catalytic activity was evaluated and compared with conventionally synthesized hydrotalcites (co-precipitation method) in the Knoevenagel condensation between furfural and ethyl cyanoacetate/malononitrile. Characterization and catalytic activity results clearly demonstrate that the proposed combined mechanochemical/coprecipitation approach provides an improvement in crystallinity, morphology, tunable basicity, and textural properties (higher surface area and enhanced surface properties) as compared to HTs obtained via conventional coprecipitation methods. In addition, mechanochemically synthesized HTs largely improve catalytic activities, including conversion and product selectivity to Knoevenagel condensation products under solventless conditions, short reaction times, or reaction at room temperature as compared to conventional counterparts (e.g., 30-40 vs > 99% product yields).

Reasonable structural models (non-periodic and periodic structural models) are the basis of density functional calculations. A periodic structure model was more appropriate to represent the catalyst surface, and its theoretical calculation results were more comparable with the experimental results than a non-periodic model. It is generally believed that the SCR mechanism where NH3 and NO react to produce N-2 and H2O follows an Eley-Rideal type mechanism. NH2NO was found to be an important intermediate in the SCR reaction, with multiple production routes. Simultaneously, the effects of H2O, SO2 and metal on SCR catalysts were also summarized.

Potassium species were supplied by impregnating catalyst with corresponding KNO3, KCl and K2SO4 aqueous solution. Catalytic activity was also measured and the physical and chemical properties of fresh and poisoned catalysts were characterized by XRD, N-2 physisorption, NH3-TPD, H-2-TPR, XPS and NH3-DRIFTS. Deactivation could be observed in the potassium-containing catalysts and the deactivation rate follows KCl > K2O > K2SO4. The surface chemisorbed oxygen was also reduced and the downward trend was in good accordance with the SCR activity. In addition, both the amount and stability of the Bronsted and Lewis acid sites dropped after potassium introduction, and the reducibility of surface active species decreased. The introduction of SO42- created new Bronsted acid sites and performed advantages to ammonia adsorption and NO reduction. Cl-could react with vanadia active sites to form -O-V-Cl bond, which provided some new ammonia adsorption sites, but these newly generated sites could not revitalize the adsorbed ammonia and were helpless to catalytic activity promotion. Besides, KCl presented the maximum impact on catalyst reducibility was another contribution to its largest activity decline. Finally, the probable poisoning mechanisms of different potassium species over V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalysts were proposed.

We investigated the physiological effects and the overall fatty acid tissue composition of a nutritional supplementation of DPA compared both to EPA and DHA in healthy adult rats. Rats (n=32) were fed with semisynthetic diets supplemented or not with 1% of total lipids as EPA, DPA or DHA in ethyl esters form from weaning for 6 weeks. Fatty acid tissue composition was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and blood assays were performed. The DPA supplementation was the only one that led to a decrease in plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, cholesterol esters and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio compared to the nonsupplemented control group. The three supplemented groups had increased plasma total antioxidant status and superoxide dismutase activity. In all supplemented groups, the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid level increased in all studied tissues (liver, heart, lung, spleen, kidney, red blood cells, splenocytes, peripheral mononucleated cells) except in the brain. We showed that the DPA supplementation affected the overall fatty acid composition and increased DPA, EPA and DHA tissue contents in a similar way than with EPA. However, liver and heart DHA contents increased in DPA-fed rats at the same levels than in DHA-fed rats.

Modification of titania by lanthanum prior to gold deposition entailed highly improved catalytic activities for ammonium formate (AmFo) and formic acid decomposition under SCR-relevant conditions stemming from dual phenomena: particle size effect and base effect. Smaller gold particles were stabilized, and there was higher uptake of CO2 and formic acid, as demonstrated by HAADF-STEM and in situ DRIFT analyses, respectively. The difference in the activities between the lanthanum-modified, unmodified, and tungsten-modified catalysts was implicitly dictated by the formic acid coverage, which was in turn greatly increased in the presence of base. In situ DRIFT studies under reaction conditions identified formate as a relevant reaction intermediate, under reaction conditions. Higher E-a,E-app alongside a higher pre-exponential factor (A), describe an underlying compensation effect originating from the contribution of enthalpy associated with the desorption of the strongly adsorbed formate, which is consistent with the highly negative formic acid orders observed in the case of the lanthanum-modified catalysts. Gold is essential to achieve selectivity to CO2; its absence yields CO. The introduction of lanthanum to the catalytic system preferentially promoted the CO2 formation mechanism, enabling complete decomposition of formic acid selectively to CO2 at significantly lower gold loading and lower contact times, making it a promising candidate for decomposition of formate-based ammonia precursors in the SCR process.

The synergistic electrocatalysis for value-added chemical production through oxygen species (Oads: OH*, 0*, and OOH*) and the active hydrogen species (Hads) derived from water splitting powered by "green" electricity from renewable energy resource (wind, solar, etc.) is a promising manner, because of its reduced energy consumption and emission and high Faradaic efficiency. The study and summarization of catalytic mechanism of synergistic electrocatalysis are particularly significant, but are rarely involved. In this review, recent progress of various synergistic electrocatalysis systems for generating valuable products based on water cycle is systematically summarized. Importantly, the catalytic mechanism of synergistic electrocatalysis and the positive effect of (Dads and Had, species produced by water splitting during the synergistic electrocatalytsis are detailedly elucidated, Furthermore, the regulation of water -derived ()ads and Hads species for achieving efficient matchability of synergistic electrocatalysis is emphatically discussed. Finally, we propose the limitations and future goals of this synergistic system based on water cycle. This review is guidance for design of synergistic electrocatalysis architectures for producing valuable substances based on water cycle.

The calcined Ca-Al hydrocalumites were active with a selectivity toward GC that reached 97% at 93% conversion of glycerol over the sample with Ca/Al = 2 at 70 degrees C, 3 h, and DMC/glycerol = 3. The glycerol conversion depended mainly on the proportion of strong basic sites in the calcined Ca-Al catalysts. The Ca12Al14O33 phase in the calcined catalysts was stable, but CaO was lost in recycle experiments and thus brought deactivation.

To clarify their different influence mechanism on the interaction between arsenic oxide (As2O3) and the V2O5-based catalyst, WO3 and MoO3 doped V2O5/TiO2 catalyst models were built, density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to explore the interaction mechanism for As2O3 with V2O5, WO3 and MoO3 from a theoretical level. As2O3 adsorption configurations, adsorption energies and electronic structures were obtained, along with the detailed inter-reaction pathways and relevant energy barriers. The results indicate that strong interaction and electron transfer occur after As2O3 adsorption, the MoO3 doped catalyst has higher reactivity and stronger charge transfer with As2O3 than the WO3 doped catalyst. Moreover, on V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst, the reactivity of WO3 with As2O3 is lower than that of V2O5, hence As2O3 is inclined to react with V2O5, resulting in the catalyst deactivation. Whereas for V2O5-MoO3/TiO2 catalyst, As2O3 tends to react with the more active MoO3, thus protecting the V2O5 from arsenic poisoning. In summary, MoO3 doping provides better anti-arsenic poisoning effect than WO3, which agrees well with previous experimental results.					zhou, xinyue/JOJ-6874-2023; Hu, Bin/HGA-4499-2022; Lu, Qiang/W-5558-2018; Wu, Yang-wen/KBP-8978-2024														2468-8231					JAN	2021	499								111317	10.1016/j.mcat.2020.111317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcat.2020.111317													WOS:000604629700006

The samples were catalytically evaluated and characterized using a flow-reactor system and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that new NOx storage sites are formed on the expense of Bronsted acid sites for ammonia storage for all potassium-exposed samples. The formation of new NOx storage sites results in increased NH3-SCR activity for the potassium-exposed H-BEA samples. However, for the potassium-exposed Fe-BEA samples, the results show a significant decrease in SCR activity. Deconvolution of the Fe 2p(3/2) XPS peak shows a clear increase in the relative amount of Fe3+ for the potassium-exposed Fe-BEA samples, indicating that isolated iron species active for NH3-SCR are exchanged with potassium, forming smaller trivalent iron clusters inside the zeolite pores. Transient experiments during NH3-SCR show that the decrease in ammonia storage capacity due to potassium exposure results in a decreased period with improved NO reduction after NH3 cut-off.

Investigation of the interaction mechanism between arsenic oxides and denitrification catalyst can provide theoretical guidance for the development of anti-arsenic poisoning catalyst. To this end, the periodic V2O5-TiO2 (001) models were constructed to represent the actual vanadium-titanium-based catalyst in this study. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to explore the interaction mechanism between the catalyst surface and typical arsenic oxide (As2O3) in flue gas. Stable adsorption configurations and adsorption energies for As2O3 and NH3 adsorption were calculated, the detailed interaction pathways and reaction barriers were also obtained. The results indicate that As2O3 is chemisorbed on the catalyst surface, strong interaction and electron transfer occur after As2O3 adsorption. The adsorption strength of NH3 on Lewis and Bronsted sites are decreased after As2O3 adsorption and the inhibition effect on the Lewis acid sites is much stronger. As2O3 is oxidized to As2O5 on catalyst surface, the Lewis acid sites (V = O) are destroyed and the valence of vanadium is decreased, which should be responsible for the catalyst deactivation. The analysis of the interaction pathway shows that As2O3 inclines to react with two adjacent V2O5 clusters to produce V2O4 because of the lowest energy barrier. Therefore, when the catalyst is poisoned by As2O3 in flue gas, the active component V2O5 inclines to generate V2O4, which is consistent with previous experimental researches.					zhou, xinyue/JOJ-6874-2023; Wu, Yang-wen/KBP-8978-2024; Lu, Qiang/W-5558-2018	XU, Mingxin/0000-0003-1563-9846													0169-4332	1873-5584				JAN 1	2021	535								147752	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147752													WOS:000582373900076

However, mitochondrial acetyltransferases have not been identified. Here, we show that acetylation and also other acylations are spontaneous processes that depend on pH value, acyl-CoA concentration and the chemical nature of the acyl residue. In the case of a peptide derived from carbamoyl phosphate synthetase1, the rates of succinylation and glutarylation were up to 150 times than for acetylation. These results were confirmed by using the protein substrate cyclophilinA (CypA). Deacylation experiments revealed that SIRT3 exhibits deacetylase activity but is not able to remove any of the succinyl groups from CypA, whereas SIRT5 is an effective protein desuccinylase. Thus, the acylation landscape on lysine residues might largely depend on the enzymatic activity of specific sirtuins, and the availability and reactivity of acyl-CoA compounds.

Hence, the preparation of high-powered anode materials for SIBs/PIBs plays a decisive role for the commercial applications of SIBs/PIBs in the future. Manganese selenides are a class of potential anode materials for SIBs/PIBs because of their small band gap and high electrical conductivity. In this work, MnSe and ReS2 core-shell nanowires connecting by polydopamine derived carbon nanotube (MnSe@NC@ReS2) have been successfully synthesized from growing ReS2 nanosheets array on the surface of MnSe@NC nanowires, which present excellent Na+/K+ storage performance. While applied as SIBs anode, the specific capacity of 300 mAh<middle dot>g(-1) was maintained after 400 cycles at the current density of 1.0 A<middle dot>g(-1). Besides, it could also keep 120 mAh<middle dot>g(-1) specific capacity after 900 cycles at 1.0 A<middle dot>g(-1) for the anode of PIBs. These heterogeneous engineering and one-dimensional-two-dimensional (1D-2D) hybrid strategies could provide an ideal strategy for the synthesis of new hetero-structured anode materials with outstanding battery performance for SIBs and PIBs.

Several families of ADPribose synthesizing enzymes use NAD(+) as substrate and control processes like DNA repair, replication and transcription, chromatin structure, the activity of G-proteins and others. Since NAD(+)-dependent reactions involve degradation of the dinucleotide, a constant supply of the pyridinic substrate is required for its homeostasis. NAD(+)-dependent signaling reactions include protein deacetylation by sirtuins, intracellular calcium signaling and mono-/poly-ADP-ribosylation. In the context of all NAD(+)-dependent reactions leading to ADP-ribose synthesis, this review focuses mainly on both the central role played by sirtuins and poly-ADPribose polymerases as cellular NAD(+) consumers and their crosstalk in signaling pathways.						faraone mennella, maria rosaria/0000-0003-1947-4700													1093-9946	1093-4715				JAN 1	2015	20						458	473		10.2741/4319	http://dx.doi.org/10.2741/4319								25553461					WOS:000354353700004

The liver is a metabolic and immunologic organ: A reconsideration of metabolic decompensation due to infection in inborn errors of metabolism (IEM)	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM												Metabolic decompensation in inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) is characterized by a rapid deterioration in metabolic status leading to life-threatening biochemical perturbations (e.g. hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, acidosis, organ failure). Infection is the major cause of metabolic decompensation in patients with IEM. We hypothesized that activation of the immune system during infection leads to further perturbations in end organ metabolism resulting in increased morbidity. To address this, we established model systems of metabolic decompensation due to infection. Using these systems, we have described the pathologic mechanisms of metabolic decompensation as well as changes in hepatic metabolic reserve associated with infection. First and foremost, our studies have demonstrated that the liver experiences a significant local innate immune response during influenza infection that modulates hepatic metabolism. Based on these findings, we are the first to suggest that the role of the liver as a metabolic and immunologic organ is central in the pathophysiology of metabolic de compensation due to infection in IEM. The dual function of the liver as a major metabolic regulator and a lymphoid organ responsible for immunosurveillance places this organ at risk for hepatotoxicity. Mobilization of hepatic reserve and the regenerative capacity of a healthy liver compensates for this calculated risk. However, activation of the hepatic innate immune system may be deleterious in IEM. Based on this assertion, strategies aimed at modulating the innate immune response may be a viable target for intervention in the treatment of hepatic metabolic decompensation.

Researchers formerly focused on the phosphorylation of glucagon in controlling liver metabolism. Noteworthily, emerging evidence has shown glucagon could additionally induce acetylation to control hepatic metabolism in response to different physiological states. Through inducing acetylation of complex metabolic networks, glucagon interacts extensively with various energy-sensing factors in shifting from glucose metabolism to lipid metabolism during prolonged fasting. In addition, glucagon-induced acetylation of different energy-sensing factors is involved in the advancement of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to liver cancer.

The physicochemical parameters like molecular weights, the radius of gyration, hydrodynamic radius, and conformation will be considered when the reproducibility of polymer behavior in solution is necessary for the subsequent optimization of the property profile of a designed product. Since there are various sources of cellulose, and the methods of cellulose extraction and chemical modification have variable yields, materials with variable molecular weights, and size polydispersity will often result. Later, the molecular masses will influence other physicochemical properties of cellulosic materials, both in solution and solid state. Consequently, the most rigorous determination of these quantities is imperative. In this regard, the following are presented and discussed in this review: the theoretical foundations of the light scattering phenomenon, the evolution of the specific instrumentation and detectors, the development of the detector-coupling techniques which include a light scattering detector, and finally, the importance of the specific parameters of polymers in solution, resulting from the data analysis of light scattering signals. All these aspects are summarized according to the chemical classification of the materials: celluloses, esters of cellulose, co-esters of cellulose, alkyl esters of cellulose, ethers of cellulose, and other heterogeneous cellulose derivatives with applications in life sciences.

J	Vakili, O; Mafi, A; Pourfarzam, M				Vakili, Omid; Mafi, Alireza; Pourfarzam, Morteza			Liver Disorders Caused by Inborn Errors of Metabolism	ENDOCRINE METABOLIC & IMMUNE DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS												Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a vast array of inherited/congenital disorders, affecting a wide variety of metabolic pathways and/or biochemical processes inside the cells. Although IEMs are usually rare, they can be represented as serious health problems. During the neonatal period, these inherited defects can give rise to almost all key signs of liver malfunction, including jaundice, coagulopathy, hepato- and splenomegaly, ascites, etc. Since the liver is a vital organ with multiple synthetic, metabolic, and excretory functions, IEM-related hepatic dysfunction could seriously be considered life-threatening. In this context, the identification of those hepatic manifestations and their associated characteristics may promote the differential diagnosis of IEMs immediately after birth, making therapeutic strategies more successful in preventing the occurrence of subsequent events.
